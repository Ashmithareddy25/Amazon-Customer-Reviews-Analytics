0440237688|4.0|It's a bit difficult to put into words how I felt about Lowry's The Giver. The first thing that came to mind and just wouldn't go away is \\"horrific\\". And though one can't really be caught surprised with the unfolding of events since Lowry, as a measure of her skill as a storyteller, quite expertly built up the climax, there's still a part of me that kept thinking, \\"Surely it wouldn't be so bad...\\"<br /><br />Of course, it was inevitable that this seemingly eerily perfect world she created would topple. And it was all brought about by the power of memories and one's yearning for love. It made me realize that I've never felt so perplexed and awed by a story in a long while.<br /><br />Certainly dialectic and begging for a multitude of interpretations, The Giver is another one of those worthy reads that dared to explore, among other things, the boundaries of threshold a person can reach, along with one's capacity to break free of bonds just to truly realize what it is to be human.
B00109T5WY|5.0|people want to complain about Young Mountain being a rip off of Explosions In the Sky or Mogwai all they want, but this release definitely sets them apart. The quiet moments here contain as much emotion as the crescendos, and in my opinion they blow explosions away in the emotive post-rock category (because EITS same after a while).     If you really like EITS and are looking for something more like it, i wouldn't recommend this outright. I'd compare it more to Mono's You Are There, but slightly more soft spoken. Like many bands, this is a band that is much much more powerful when seen live, but not to say their studio work doesn't do it justice.    So if you're looking for something for the impatient (or ADD), i wouldn't recommend anything remotely like this. This demands to be savored and sat with, to be reflected on and actually appreciated. if you're looking for something a bit faster and harder, I'd tell you to get Russian Circles enter (although that has some slow bits too), or Samus Octology by Irepress. For those looking for something with a slow build up, crescendos that will come close to actually destroying you, and straight beauty with power, check this out.
031606792X|5.0|This was a really great book in the twilight saga some of it seemed strange but in a good way. Some things went unanswered so im convinced that Stephenie is writing another book that she isn's telling us about and that would be fantastic. It's definitely worth reading.
0307346617|5.0|I was so pleasantly suprised by the quality of Mr. Brook's second book.  He clearly has done his homework with so many little details in this story.  His understanding of governments, military equipment, geography and human nature are all evident in this story.  This creates a rich tapestry on which to superimpose an epidemic of undead cannibals.      One of the best aspects of this story is that Mr. Brook's has truly taken a world's eye view of the conflict.  He relates narratives from sources all over the globe including China, Japan, Iran, Indian, the Artic and the good old USA.    A good yarn, if maneating reanimated corpses overrunning the world is your thing!
0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki's book does have some strengths, but also sends some mixed signals and has a lot of plain bad advice. Overall, the book is a bad choice.    The good:  - The story is interesting enough and certainly captures one's attention.  - The motivational part. It does make you think about your financial life.    The mixed:  - \\"Leaving the Rat Race\\" -- spend less, invest more: excellent and much needed advice. Unfortunately, Kiyosaki's own bad example follows. He brags about his Rolex, luxury cars and such. Given the amount of time that he seems to spend promoting his stuff, maybe Kiyosaki himself is in the Rat Race -- albeit in a golden, roomier cage.  - \\"Work to learn, not for the money\\". Again, good advice followed by bad examples. Learning at work is usually by DOING, not by being around or watching other people do. So, the Xerox case is fine, but all the others are just foolish.  - \\"Assets and liabilities\\". Dubious \\"redefinitions\\": something that doesn't put money in your pocket can still be an asset (if it saves you money that would otherwise be spent -- say, a house...).    The bad:  - The whole \\"traditional education is bad for you\\" approach. No, it isn't. Harvard costs what it costs for a reason. The reason is more money for YOU down the road.  - \\"Pay yourself first\\". Bad idea. If you're on a positive cash flow, it makes no difference. If you're not, it makes you incur in debt and thus INTEREST, which is a nice way to throw away money for zero added value.  - Risk isn't always good, as Kiyosaki implies. The strategies discussed in the book are very unsound and will work only on a bullish market (if any).  - Insider trading and tax evasion are illegal, period.    And the naked, cruel truth that RDPD DOES NOT SAY:  (because it isn't \\"best-seller material\\")  - According to Kiyosaki's theory, all you have to do is \\"wake up the financial genius within you\\". In reality, there are two honest ways of making money in this world:  1) WORKING. Ok, say you were lucky enough to have a truly great idea or talent. You still would have to work -- don't Steve Jobs, Madonna or Shaquille O'Neal work? Then again, not everybody will be THIS lucky -- and in this case, you are much better off being a highly paid EDUCATED worker. Just the opposite of what RDPD says. By the way, making money from real estate or IPOs or starting your own business will require a lot of work and knowledge, too. Even more than a white collar job.  2) CAPITAL GAINS. Dividends and interest. Kiyosaki is right that it is possible to live on them. What he doesn't say is that it will take a TON of cash to make a decent living within manageable risk levels. And you must HAVE money to BEGIN WITH -- which means inherit it (but then you would not be reading RDPD, would you?) or, more likely, work and SAVE A LOT.  Consider a 3% yearly interest rate above inflation, which is what low-work/low-risk will get. In order to have $5000/month BEFORE TAXES -- not exactly a high roller lifestyle -- you would need $2 million.  Even somebody investing at 8% above inflation (and, may I add, 8% ON THE LONG RUN isn't that easy to achieve), starting from scratch and saving 50% of whatever comes in -- a very rigid discipline -- would take 33 years before being able to live on passive income. Make that a quarter, which is still above the savings level of most Americans, and you got 47 years.  Don't believe me? Open up Excel or Calc and type:  =NPER(8%;1;0;-12/8%)  =NPER(8%;1;0;-36/8%)  Still don't get it? Stop reading RPDP and go STUDY real, not fairy tale, economy.
B00065GX64|5.0|Of course, Edvard Grieg was the composer of the &#34;Peer Gynt Suite&#34; which included &#34;Hall of the Mountain King&#34;.  In this film, Peter Lorre's character whistles this little ditty whenever he gets a &#34;Jones&#34; for murder; so much for my title.  As far as &#34;M&#34; goes; if you haven't heard, it's an incredibly good film.  I could go on and on about its historical significance, its artistic merit or Fritz Lang, but you've all heard that before.  All I have to say is that I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies.<br /><br />What, you need more?<br /><br />Here we go...<br /><br />-PUTTING IT IN MODERN PERSPECTIVE<br />You might think that since this film was made in 1931, that you will need to turn back your expectations to 1931 levels.  Think again.  If you remade this film shot for shot with today's actors and with today's technology you would never figure out that this film was conceived 77 years ago.  The story could have happened yesterday and the execution is timeless.  When you consider that this was Lang's first sound film, it's astounding how many sound techniques he pioneered that are still in use today (or not used enough).  Adding to the realism and preservation of &#34;M's&#34; timelessness is the complete lack of a dated musical score.  This is better than you can imagine.<br /><br />-CHARACTERS, CHARACRERS<br />This film is packed with great characters.  Another tribute to Lang's talent is his ability to establish characters with just a few words, a simple but telling action or even a look.  The dialogue is very real and powerful (even though it's all in German).  Not one line is wasted.  The characters run the gamut from strong and forceful to meek and poignant.  Peter Lorre is the main character despite his limited screen time.  But, when he's on screen he is loathsome, heartbreaking, pitiful and human all at the same time.  I've never seen anything better from him.  Other characters make their presence strongly felt but be warned; Herr Lohman gets in your face in a very unpleasant, yet funny way.<br /><br />-THE FIRST SERIAL KILLER FILM<br />Of course, it's not simply just about a serial killer.  It's about society's response to him.  It's about the underbelly of society's response to him.  It's about the institutions of society's response to him.  It's about all of those things in great detail.  I was amazed at how advanced police techniques were at the time of this film as well as the depth of psychological profiling.  The only thing missing was infrared and DNA mapping.  Lang used all of these devices as a means to establish great frustration at failure to solve the mystery; who is the murderer?  Particularly interesting is Lang's apparently well researched depiction of the inner working of the German underworld.  Even the beggars had a union with member ID numbers and log books.<br /><br />-OK, LANG WAS A GENIUS!<br />There, I said it.  Are you happy now?  Lang made this film for the explicit purpose of warning parents to watch their children more closely.  In the years leading to this film, Germany had a rash of serial killers haunting its cities.  So, this was a timely yet somewhat reviled film.  It was reviled for the perception that it was exploiting the actual killings for the sake of ticket sales.  Of course, Lang insisted &#34;M' was a cautionary tale and nothing else.  Despite its reviled status and raw subject matter, &#34;M&#34; limits its depictions of violence to a few punches.  The rest of the violence is simply implied for one simple reason; the audience can imagine more horrible acts than the Director could or would depict.  Fritz Lang thought showing violence against children would be tasteless.  It was this kind of thinking that motivated many of Lang's best devices that carried the story in the viewers mind, which is more powerful than anything on the screen; a lesson for today's film makers.<br /><br />-THE DVD<br />This is what you would expect from a Criterion release; an informative booklet, a film restored as completely as possible and an extra disk chocked full of rare and informative material.  I managed to get this new for under $17 so I am very pleased with my purchase.  In retrospect, I would probably pay more.<br /><br />-VERDICT OF THE KANGEROO COURT<br />This is a film for anyone who likes crime dramas done well.  But, if you aren't a fan of crime dramas, don't turn away; it's more than that.  You don't need to be a film snob to enjoy this film; it is so well made that it's easy to enjoy.  I would recommend that you pay close attention though; you don't want to miss the beautiful details of which there are many.  The worst thing that could happen is that you'll learn a few cuss words auf Deutche (in German).<br /><br />P.S.; the whistling was actually done by Fritz Lang's Wife since Lorre could not whistle.<br /><br />-Acting...5 Stars<br />-Story....5 Stars<br />-Visuals..5 Stars<br />-DVD......5 Starsriterion release; an informative booklet, a film restored as completely as possible and an extra disk chocked full of rare and informative material.

B0013IKUIK|5.0|I got this album last year when it was independently released. So, so good. Many say it's a winter album, but I find I've enjoyed it in summer months too. At less than three dollars, it would be silly not to download this album.
031606792X|5.0|I think this was a great series, and the ending was better than I had expected. I really would love it to continue though!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I bought this DVD because I am a CSI/GSR fanatic. I run GSRForeverLove.com  and tend to collect anything I can get with Jorja Fox or William Petersen. So, I had to own this film, boy I am glad I do.<br /><br />The film is a hard one to 'get' the first time around, and I am not even going to get into the plot, except to say, it's original. I was enthralled from the start. Guy Pierce is amazing and delivers an outstanding performance. Nothing new there, I've seen him in other films.<br /><br />My main reason for buying this was Jorja Fox, and even though her time in the film is short, she leaves a great impression, and the film is all about her.<br /><br />I recomend this to any mystery fan, and to each CSI/GSR/Sara fan. It's a must own for film fans as well.
0321344758|5.0|As the subtitle says, it is mostly common sense. But to have it reinforced like this turns judging web site designs into a much simpler task. I found myself feeling like I had confirmation for many thoughts I have on the subject, but it raised my awareness of different user view points to a higher level. One item that was quite new to me though was the subject of usability testing. He explains his approach quite well and makes it sound quite easy and very useful. If nothing else, it gives you a sense of empathy for various user experiences on the web. Which can only help you improve your design's ability to meet their needs.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone who is involved with web development in any way to check out this very quick and easy read.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|I still love and enjoy this movie everytime I watch it. Thanks to blu ray technology, it got so much better. Big improvement with the picture quality and sound. A great addition to your movie library. I recommend it. Enjoy!
B001AJVR5M|4.0|I am not a screeching teenybopper. I'll be twenty-eight this year, in fact. And I still think this is a great album.<br /><br />I think most people who dismiss the Jonas Brothers know nothing about their sound. I'm guilty of this myself - for the longest time, I thought they were a manufactured boy band. I had no idea they actually played their own instruments [gasp!] and wrote their own songs [double gasp!].<br /><br />What makes this record work is the completely earnest treatment of basic pop-rock songs. They give credit where credit is due. [The simple fact that they do a live cover of A-ha's 'Take On Me' endeared me to them tremendously.] These songs sound more like classic Duran Duran and Cheap Trick than anything released in the past five years. The arrangements are guitar-heavy and synth-filled - they lack lame beatbox crooning.<br /><br />Make no mistake that, although that the trio are often classified as 'teen pop', this is a rock band playing rock songs. 'Shelf' might as well be a track off a Weezer album; 'Video Girl' is a snarky punk number worthy of Rancid; and 'A Little Bit Longer' is so steeped in The Beatles I had to recheck my digital liner notes to make sure it wasn't a cover.<br /><br />Of course, there is nothing truly experimental going on here. The boys are making the best of pop riffs. But they're sassy, blissful, sophisticated pop riffs, and that's more than I can say for most corporate stuff being churned out these days.<br /><br />The bottom line is that sure, they're teenagers, and sure, millions of young girls want to marry them, but this album is musically pugnacious and seriously entertaining, and no conscientious adult should be ashamed to admit that.
B000PC6A3E|4.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, the best Batman yet. Fell in love and enjoyed it even more when I bought the blu ray. Excellent picture & sound! A must have in your movie library. I highly recommend it. Enjoy folks!
031606792X|5.0|Normally, I buy all my books from Amazon, but Breaking Dawn got such a huge display at our local bookstore I just had to buy it - I'm glad I did. (I wish Ammie allowed italics in reviews to use as emphasis, because \\"glad\\" would be emphasized) out of all the book reviews I read I'm flabbergasted by the 1 star reviews this book received. Are you upset that this is the final book in the series? Surely the writing is stupendous, the loose ends (albeit a li'l predictable) are all tied up. Bella has as much complexity and substance as in the three previous books. This book is all about the consequences that resulted from the choices of the characters in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. And just like all series the story loses umph by the third and fourth book, but if you're interested in Bella and Edward this is a great book. Well Done!
B0015XHP3G|3.0|A pretty good sequel. Get the blu ray. Great picture & sound. I'm sure anyone can enjoy it even more.
0743496736|5.0|I went on line - ordered two books - paid on line - they arrived a few days later - read the books - enjoyed the books - this is what summer is all about.  A perfect way to \\"shop\\".
0786838655|5.0|this is the best book in history. i love the series 2. its about a boy who  has does not know who his father is and all of the gods think he stole a valuable  thing . Its kind alike a cooooooooler hp!!!!! but better and some times i some times read it again.
1416550518|5.0|This book is very similar to the PBS TV show from the 70's called Upstairs/Downstairs. It was about an English household told from the domestic service maid, Grace.  It flips from 1924 and back to 1999. The story is alittle mystery, alittle love story and lots of great reading!<br />This is a joy to anyone who reads it!<br /><br />Loved it!
B0014U4X3U|4.0|I appreciated rereading Austen's work over the summer, and it was a natural choice for me to get it on my new Kindle.  The pages look great and the type is adjustable.  The one drawback was the size of the illustrations.  Condensed onto the Kindle's screen they were difficult to appreciate.  The fact that the book in e-version is so light to carry made up for this.  It also made a difference in that the Kindle helped me look up the word \\"eclaircissement\\" as I was reading it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to agree with many other reviews when I say this is not for whimps so don't bother in trying this if you are. These workouts are for seriously committed people, its HARD and INTENSE. It doesn't waste any time. When I started these workouts I was already working out, but I have seen some serious results in my body though you don't notice it at first. I am on the third level of this video and it still kicks my butt especially the last circuit cylcle of level 3. In one month I have lost 10 lbs and I still have 13 more pounds to go to reach my goal weight. I have done these workouts almost 5-6 times a week, but sometimes I will do an extra workout in the morning before heading out to work and on the weekends I find something active to do such as jogging etc.  I eat healthy about 4-5 times in the day, I am not taking any diet pills, plenty of water, rest  multivitamin, therefore I am happy to say I have shedded 10 lbs on my own  through hard work. OH yeah and I allow myself 1 cheat day a week... hey  it's the least I deserve after all that hard work.    I am a single mom, so believe me when I say time is of the essence. Sometimes I am doing these workouts with my son in the background or him on top of me while I am doing pushups etc. Therefore, this in a short intense workout that will give you results. I am finally losing the   baby weight, hence the baby is 2 but I am getting definition in my abs and arms again,  not to mention many glances from the opposite sex and   compliments from friends and co-workers.    I HIGHLY recommend these videos, but like I said this is not for whimps, you have to be dedicated, motivated and like anything when you feel the   most discouraged just keep at it. There is no miracle for losing weight it takes hard work but the satisfaction you get from the results has no comparison by far.
031606792X|5.0|I thought Breaking Dawn was genius and the best book of the series so far. Stephenie Meyer wrapped Bella and Edward's story up perfectly, having decided not to write any more, yet leaving some room for another book or two. Everything was fairly unexpected,and come on, who really wants to read something that you expect? We all expected for something to happen to where Bella wasn't going to be turned into a vampire, some kind of delay,at least. But not only was it not delayed, it was sped up. I also think Meyer's writing was even more elegant in this book, and it was a great idea to make 1/3 of the book written from Jacob's perspective. Also, this book was better because it wasn't the same old constant whining from Bella,things happened very quickly and at the end the big conflict was resolved the way it was because it was of no gain to either side to resolve it any other way.It takes an open mind to truly appreciate Stephenie Meyer's shear genius.
0385340567|3.0|Lee Child is not up to his usual quality with this one. Ok, but still sub par. Plot development is a little strained, characters seem stilted.
0061537934|5.0|What a thoroughly enjoyable novel.  Loved Enzo, Denny, Zoe and Eve. I'm not a dog owner... but a cat owner.Hardly matters, I love animals...and this book has just so many valuable lessons:\\"Hands are the windows to a man's soul\\". I would put the book down and pause to think about what I had just read...or wipe my eyes, or blow my nose, or laugh. Something for everyone! One of my favorites this summer.
B000001DYA|5.0|Take 3 kids with a vision.Not a musical prodigy among them.Not cutey pie types, nor fancy lyrical song writers.<br />Not even a good voice in the band.<br />Watch them do something that can never be equaled by anyone.<br />Rock and roll is beautiful!
B00011KHTM|3.0|For what you get. it's over priced and very short. It's used in conjunction with a Dvi-d dual link cable to connect a macbook to my LCD TV. It works ok, but like i said. It could be longer.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  Although I will warn you that if you want traditional romance, comedy, and drama, then this film is not for you.  After all it is made by Focus Features, and was written by Charlie Kauffman.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a quirky comedy/drama.  Jim Carrey is amazing as the understated, and at times, dull Joel.  Kate Winslet is perfection as the outspoken, trying-so-hard-to-impress-you freak girl Clementine.  They meet and have a wonderful relationship, but like so many others, they fall apart.<br /><br />In the quirkiest of turns, Joel finds out Clementine has had him erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same.  And this is where the action and emotion begin.  While remembering all the pain and anguish this love affair caused him, he also realizes that those emotions pale in comparison to the love and affection they also shared (but have apparently forgotten about).<br /><br />This movie has a truly stunning ending that makes me cry with happiness.  The story is so brutally honest that anyone who has ever loved and lost should feel some sort of connection to these characters and their plight.<br /><br />I love this movie, and it will continue to be one of my favorites for all time.  Highly recommended!!
B000UJ48XG|1.0|After reading numerous POSITIVE Reviews I thought I would give this CD a shot, as I am also a fan of early 1900's French and Parisian Music... and this CD was extolled to be such....and these were also very romantic times!  Well, as we all have broad tastes in music so do I and when I say my tastes are broad, I'm being conservative as about the only thing I don't like is Opera and Rap!  Anything else in between usually works!  However, not this CD!  I've TRIED listening to every track and was, today, on my 3rd-attempt to try and find something about it that I could enjoy!  I got up to selection #5 and hit the eject button!  To me it was nothing but noise, more noise and then some more!!  It's going on eBay tomorrow for 1-cent plus shipping!  Look for it!
B0013FNC38|5.0|What a GREAT CD!  I hadn't heard of the artist before \\"I'm Yours\\" began to get alot of airplay.  As a matter of fact, it was difficult to locate the musician because of the spelling of his last name.  It was trial and error.  Then I purchased the CD and got immediately hooked.  What a talent!  There isn't a bad cut on the entire musical offering.  The artist may not like this description, but what a \\"feel good\\" CD.
031606792X|4.0|I've read many of the reviews for Breaking Dawn and came to the conclusion.... It's a BOOK, a story, a fairy tale of love please let's not get too serious over it.  The teenagers who read this book will not jump for the chance on getting pregnant nor will it fill there little heads with getting married at 18 I'm sure there are worse things they are thinking about than reading this book and wanting to have a child and get married at 18 (War, SAT's, College, not getting caught sneaking out). Although I was a bit disappointed with the happily ever after and the unresolved questions (What about Jacob, does he have a happy ending? Will she tell Renee? Will the Volturi return?) would we as fans like a blood curling ending where Bela dies or Edward? We would still complain about it and then some.  I think Stephanie did a great job and I look forward to reading her next project \\"Midnight Sun\\" Edward's version of \\"Twilight\\".  If we are die hard fans of Stephanie and her writing let's support her through good or bad.  You can't please everyone so I'm sure my comment will get many boo's but que sera sera.  Let's remember that although books do educate us they can also take us to places we never dreamed of imagining and for just one second forget any issues we are having at the time.    Stephanie, Keep up the great work, no matter what this fan is still with you :)    Tammy
0061544493|4.0|This is a fun and light book to read.  For anyone who's a little behind in the fashion know how to..., this book will help you.  It's funny and witty and what you take away from it is that fashion is for everyone not matter what age, size or bank account you have.
B0017MO10U|5.0|If you're a SG-1 fan, don't even bother reading the reviews, just watch this great movie.  It's better than Ark of Truth (which I liked) and has everything a fan could want: Goa'uld (including some system lords you haven't seen for a while), time travel, action and special effects galore (including some very nice space action), special appearances from Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis, and a great story.      I really liked how they played out the \\"no Stargate program\\" storyline.  If this was the last SG-1 movie (hopefully not), they definitely went out the right way.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie.
6302482585|3.0|Despite the high regard many romantics hold for this film, I find it predictable and bare-boned in its plot, as were many early films. Many excellent romantic movies have been made over the ensuing decades, but you should watch Casablanca at least once, for it has influenced the English language.
031606792X|5.0|First let me say that I am a 25 year old fan of the whole Twilight series.  I do not agree with some reviewers in thinking that these books are not appropriate for their intended teenage audience.  I think they are suitable for both young adults and adults.  Breaking Dawn was by far my favorite of the entire series.  I was impressed and satisfied with the way she tied up all the loose ends as well as leaving it open to continue the story from some of the other characters.  I was worried about the whole Jacob/Edward conflict and was very satisfied with the outcome (did not think it was creepy at all!).  I also liked Bella's character in this book more than the two previous.  Let's just say she mellows out quite a bit and isn't so flippant and selfish.  Looking forward to hearing Twilight from Edward's perspective as well as future vampire books from SM!

B001CB2A1I|5.0|I was entranced by the book ... not wanting to put it down to attend to other matters (oh like eating a meal.) As to the negative comments about having phrases that a family would use that mean nothing to others... like YEAH. My family does... I thought all families did.<br />... guess not..<br />I wonder if the readers who found this book lacking in some ways, have some amazingly different approach to reading than I do? Yeah... I am sure of that. I enjoyed this book and it grabbed my imagination all the way through.
B00002ND77|5.0|I was not an avid follower of this man, but some of his ideals should have been scrutinized  for a better community amongst the people mainly African Americans.    He was a man of integrity especially with family life.  His followers were not as strong minded as he just as those in MLK's time.  Those supposed followers reacted to certain aspects of their ideas I believe, just to announce that they were a part of a group with some power.    The followers did not fully understand their leader who was for the equality of Human Race.
B0018AK9RK|4.0|One of my all time favorite \\"best of\\" Collections of Priest is Hero, Hero.( [[ASIN:B00004SR2F Hero, Hero]]) There is just something about the way that album was put together and the way it flows from one song to the next that I always enjoyed.     As I have listened to this CD over and over I enjoy it more and more. There are times where I hit the last song on one CD and it restarts at the beginning of the CD where I don't even notice that it went back to the beginning until I look down at what track I'm on.     Those looking for a \\"Head Bang\\" album probably will be disappointed. But if you are like me and enjoy the early Priest music as well as the newer stuff you will enjoy this CD.
B001DSNELA|5.0|In the past I've double-dipped so many DVD special editions but I might just pass on this one, by buying the CASINO ROYALE Collector's edition one would concede in advance that when QUANTUM OF SOLACE is released on DVD early next year it will also be part of your collection temporarily since a Collector's edition of it will surely come out in the future. In other words, there's no end to this craziness.  It's too bad they didn't even try to match this release to the rest of the Bond collection (regarding covers, menus, etc.). Yet another reason to pass on this.  About the movie itself, well, it's great to know that one of the later Bonds clearly belongs at the top of the list. It's just that the 2 disc edition will have to do.
1400097029|5.0|Booker Prize-winning author John Banville presents a sensitive and remarkably complete character study of Max Morden, an art critic/writer from Ireland whose wife has just died of a lingering illness. Seeking solace, Max has checked into the Cedars, a now-dilapidated guest house in the seaside village of Ballyless, where he and his family spent their summers when he was a child. There he spent hours in the company of Chloe and Myles Grace, his constant companions. Images of foreboding suggest that some tragedy occurred while he was there, though the reader discovers only gradually what it might have been. While at the Cedars, he contemplates the nature of life, love, and death, and our imperfect memories of these momentous events.<br /><br />As Max probes his recollections, he reveals his most intimate feelings, constantly questioning the accuracy of his memory, and juxtaposing his childhood memories with his recent memories of his wife Anna's \\"inappropriate\\" illness and her futile treatments. Through flashbacks, he also introduces us to his earlier life with Anna and his fervent hopes that through her he could become someone more interesting. \\"I was always a distinct no-one, whose fiercest wish was to be an indistinct someone,\\" he says, confessing that he saw her as \\"the fairground mirror in which all my distortions would be made straight.\\"<br /><br />More a meditation than a novel with a strong plot, The Sea brings Max to life (as limited as his life is), recreating his seemingly simple, yet often profound, thoughts in language which will startle the reader into recognition of their universality. To some extent an everyman, Max speaks to the reader in uniquely intimate ways. In breathtaking language, filled with emotional connotations, he captures nature in perfect images, often revealing life as a series of paintings--\\"a Tiepolo sky,\\" a hair-washing scene reminiscent of Duccio and Picasso. He objectifies his thoughts about memory through Pierre Bonnard's many portraits of \\"Nude in the Bath,\\" paintings of Bonnard's wife in which she remains a young girl, even when she is seventy years old. Images of the bath and the sea pervade the novel--cleansing, combined with the ebb and flow of life.<br /><br />Lovers of plot-based novels with snappy dialogue may find that the lack of external action and the novel's focus on the interior battles of an ordinary man of about sixty fail to engage their interest. Other readers, who may have faced the deaths of family or friends and recognized the limitations of memory, however, may see in Max a kindred spirit to whom they respond with empathy. I have rarely read such a short book so slowly--or reread with pleasure so many passages of extraordinary beauty and import--and I felt a connection with Max that I have never felt before in any of Banville's previous novels.

0374531269|5.0|This book should be read by every teenager in the United States and there parents.  Our children of today think life is so hard on them.  If they read this book as written by someone who had life turned upside down on them and came out with a purpose they would know that they have a pretty good life in the USA.  He will never be able to get his childhood back but can now recover from the things no child should have to see or go through.       I really enjoyed this book he made you think that he was a \\"storyteller of his village\\".  I do wish that he had added a couple of chapters at the end on how he is doing today and what he is going to do next.

B0002JJBZY|4.0|Got this as a present and love it.  Love the original series, the concept, even love the trekish cases.  However, I agree with the other review about the transfer quality on this set.  What the hell is wrong with these people?  How could you mess up one of the most popular and famous shows of all time.  Who authroized this crappy static-filled edition?  Must have been a Klingon trader or some Harry Mudd scheme.    Shoot me now, with maximum strength phasers.    Get it right next time, dolts.    But nevertheless, ahhhhhhhhhhhh, Star Trek.  The complete set.  On my shelf.
075640407X|4.0|This was, as these things should be, an engaging tale.  The latter pages seemed a bit forced and although active, they did not feel as well drawn as the early chapters, but still...a good story and I enthusiastically await the rest of the series.
B00139W3NE|5.0|I just had to stop and do a quick review of this movie.  This is the first review of a movie I have ever done.  The reason I had to review this one in particular is because while glancing through DVDs on Amazon.com I noticed this one had only 3 stars. What???  I thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Definitely one of the best \\"family\\" movies ever.  Sometimes I find myself falling asleep during \\"family\\" movies.  Not this one. The only thing I can think of to why it has only 3 stars is because of the bad rep it got before they even started filming it. I'm one of those people who like to actually view a movie before talking about it. I, like many other people, got the emails \\"warning\\" me not to watch it. It's anti-God. You will be supporting Atheists. Well, I have also watched Weeds, Hostel, and Veggie Tales. Does that make me a smoking, serial killer, who sees talking Veggie's???  It's a movie people! If you haven't seen this movie, please watch it!  I believe you and your family will love it and will be waiting for the sequel to come!  Oh, and I'm sure the people who rate this movie badly are the same people who rate Harry Potter poorly just because there are witches in it.
0385340990|5.0|I just finished the most WONDERFUL book!  The unlikely title is<br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  I can think of so many on my friends list who would really love this book.  The book is a first novel by Mary Ann Shaffer (don't you just love when that all works out for them? : &lt; ) and co-authored by Annie Barrows.<br /><br />It is written as a series of letters and while, at first glance, you may think \\"plot device\\", it is the perfect vehicle to tell this story.  Absolutely perfect.  You might even say - and I do say after reading it - it's a bit Austen-esque in it's use of correspondence to further the story.  The language is beautiful, not snooty and intellectual, but warm, intelligent and heartfelt.  The success of this book at touching my imagination and my heart - well, it was remarkable.  I haven't felt like saying \\"this is my new favorite book\\" in a long while, but I do now!<br /><br />It takes place right after WWII and our heroine is Juliet - a warm, genuine real woman with a good heart and a writers soul.  She is touched by a letter received, out of the blue, from a man in Guernsey who has enjoyed a book by Charles Lamb in which Juliet's name is written on the flyleaf - does she know where, in postwar London, he might order another book by Lamb?  So starts a rich friendship that grows through correspondence with him as well as other inhabitants of Guernsey and fellow members of the Society.  The story takes a rich turn as you realize the Society was formed during The Occupation.  Events during the Occupation and the formation of the Society relayed to Juliet by her new Guernsey friends will cause your heart to catch.  It is not all war, though that is at the center, but it is about different people coming together because of love of the written word and about their willingness to talk about their favorite books and writers and so reveal their lives to each other.<br /><br />Whether long and soul searching or short and funny letters, the characters are rich and vibrant and practically beg you to keep turning the pages.  Their character, their Society, Guernsey as a place, their place in time, their mutual love of words and books and the beginnings of deep, lifelong friendships - who could ask for anything more?ich and vibrant and practically beg you to keep turning the pages.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|I can honestly say Supernatural is my favorite TV show.  I bought seasons 1 and 2 on a whim while I was deployed to Iraq, afraid it would turn out badly since it comes from the same network as Smallville (Smallville is good, but it doesn't compare to the shows that are airing now).  It was a steal-$20 for each full season.  Third season is just as great, despite Sam and Dean's dad (actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan) didn't make an appearance.  I bought season three off iTunes but I plan to buy it on DVD for the extras alone.  This show has it all-a great soundtrack, intense moments, intriguing plot, and excellent humor.  I don't know of another show where two actors (Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki) actually act like true brothers like these two.  The humor combined with a plot about ghost/demon/mythical creatures/urban legend hunting makes for an outstanding show.  It's worth every cent you spend.
031606792X|3.0|I had anticipated this book so much. I rushed out and got it right away the day it came out.  But, after finishing it, I was disappointed.      I felt that the first part with the wedding and honeymoon was sweet.  We had a sense of the Bella and Edward from the previous books - Sweet and loving.  Some reviewers have complained about all the sex in the book, but Bella and Edward were newlyweds, not 13 year olds like the readers.  I expected it, and was glad that SM was semi-realistic about it. Newlyweds have sex, lots of it.  Especially, if they've waited until they got married. Deal with it, people.     However, my interest started to wane about the time we found out Bella was having a baby.  The book slowed and, it felt to me, nothing happened for a very long time.  The days passed in the book, but nothing of interest took place.  Bella became a vampire, and still nothing happened.  They find out the Volturi are coming, and still nothing happens. The Volturi come, and again, nothing happens.     My only other problem with the book was Bella, once she had become a vampire.  In my mind, she was now about 28 years old and very mature.  This was a huge departure from the Bella I had invisioned in the previous books.     Overall, I was disappointed, but I'm going to give it another try and see if I can enjoy it more now that I know what not to anticipate.      P.S. Renesmee?  Really?
031606792X|5.0|In \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" Stephenie Meyer lovingly and brilliantly concludes the much beloved Twilight Saga. The entire book held me spellbound...I was unable to put it down. As with its predecessors, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" possesses an addictive quality to it; one that leaves the reader thirsty for more. There are many twists and turns within the plot that I wasn't expecting that added to the joy of the reading experience. In books, it's nice not being able to predict what happens. Where's the fun in that? All 754 pages of the novel held a new gift waiting to be unwrapped. What was truly wonderful was how the book made me laugh, cry, swoon, and sometimes all three at the same time. Something that has always made the series so popular I believe is how much the reader grows to care for the characters; characters that are relatable in ways that make us find qualities of ourselves within them. Bella's pain becomes our own. Her triumphs are our triumphs. Essentially, the entire series has been leading to this book, the full evolution of Bella. More importantly though, the protagonist's epic love with 100+ year old vampire, Edward Cullen. Love in general, and it's various hues are explored in the books. The love between Bella and Edward though is what truly makes the hopeless romantics such as myself breathless for more. Such love is taken to full fruition in \\"Breaking Dawn\\"...like a steady heartbeat, it is felt through every single event and action that takes place. I will caution younger readers though that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is darker and more mature in content and writing than the previous three. While, as an older reader, I can fully appreciate and handle these aspects of the story, younger ones may not [depending on their maturity level]. Meyer pushes her characters farther than she ever has before...places that are somewhat creepy and very supernatural. I do not want to spoil, I will only say to tread lightly through certain parts. Within the book is something for everyone: sarcasm, humor, love, action, suspense, vampires, werewolves, cool new vampiric powers and characters, and so much more. Don't pay the one star reviews out there any mind. \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is 5 stars all the way. My final warning of caution: reading this book may lead to obsession [i.e. I just finished reading the book for the second time and will read it a third soon]. I loved this book, and if you are open-minded, so will you.
B000YGFGD6|5.0|If I were to take a trip back to my childhood, the aptly-named \\"Moonwalker\\", the brainchild of Michael Jackson, would be one of the prominent stops. Even back when I wasn't necessarily an MJ fan (I am now), this movie captured my imagination. Rather than a whole, cohesive movie, it's a collection of mini-films, for the most part well-woven together. The first part is a performance of \\"Man in the Mirror\\". The second is a retrospective on Michael Jackson's career, with clips from his music videos and performances from his early career to his \\"Bad\\" days (which is the era when the movie was made, and it shows). The third is a re-enactment of the \\"Bad\\" video by a younger counterpart of the cast. The fourth part is a mini-movie which features Michael Jackson escaping from maniacal fans and press by racing a motorcycle as a rabbit-man and eventually doing a dance duel with him (you really need to see it to believe it). The fifth is a video for \\"Leave Me Alone\\", and the sixth and final part is a noir/sci-fi film where Michael and three young kids on the streets who have befriended him try to escape a drug lord (Joe Pesci) who wants Michael's head after the latter discovers his plans to get all kids addicted to drugs.<br /><br />\\"Moonwalker\\" never made it to theatres in the US (it did, however, in Europe and South America), but that didn't stop the VHS release to be sold in over 800,000 copies within a year of the movie's release. It is a truly engrossing trip through the imagination of the legendary musician/entertainer. While many musicians have tried their hands at filmmaking and only succeeded at showing that they have no talent at it, Michael Jackson surprises. Not only does he show that he has as much feel for staging and visual storytelling as he has for music, he manages to make this movie his own, weaving into both the collage and story some truly imaginative moments.<br /><br />Take the midway point, where we sort of hit the \\"present\\". The \\"Bad\\" video is reenacted by younger actors, in a truly hilarious but nonetheless competent spectacle. After that, Michael Jackson emerges onto the 'streets' of Hollywood and is hounded by an assortment of stark-raving-mad, claymated fans and press. An attempt by a humoured Michael to escape his chasers ensues, but as he finds out, trying to hide out in Hollywood studios (especially when you're Michael Jackson) is about as easy as hiding the punch at a banquet.<br /><br />But his way out of this situation is possibly my favourite part of the movie. Disguising himself as a leather-clad rabbit man, he manages to escape the studios on a bicycle, which transforms into a motorcycle. At this point \\"Speed Demon\\" kicks in as the rabbit-man drives at breakneck speed down the highway, ocean and sky. And still the relentless fans and media are hot on Michael's tail, his disguise not fooling them. This all makes up a truly stunning piece of claymation, both excellently-paced and delicious to behold. Driving out into the desert, Michael takes off his disguise only to have the rabbit disguise reanimate itself, and the two do the best dance duel I've ever seen. It's especially stunning to see the claymated rabbit dance like MJ, and Will Vinton and co (who were responsible for the claymation segment, while Michael himself is live-action) truly deserve an applause for this as well as Michael.<br /><br />Following is the video for \\"Leave Me Alone\\", a truly imaginative, satirical portrait of the mass hysteria the media attribute to Michael. Michael humorously visualises this as an amusement park constructed on top of him, while a miniature version of him goes through a has-to-be-seen-to-be-believed tour, frequented by lots of dogs in suits. This video may feel like a filler but its imagination and vision more than make up for it.<br /><br />This is when the 'movie' itself begins. My favourite part is when Michael steps into a 30s-style club and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" kicks in, resulting in a truly artistic music-video sequence, climaxing in the middle, when the music dies and the club-goers chant, for almost a minute, before the music kicks back in. I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you, but these are my favourite parts.<br /><br />If you are a Michael Jackson fan then this belongs in your collection for sure. Whether or not you are a fan, if you want to see a really imaginative, creative journey through Michael Jackons's imagination, I can also recommend this. One thing is for sure; the tagline couldn't be more correct. This truly IS a movie like no other.le, when the music dies and the club-goers chant, for almost a minute, before the music kicks back in.

0743277708|4.0|Watership Down by Richard Adams is part fantasy, part children's book and all charming.  This has become a true classic that is universally loved.  Richard Adams first created Watership Down as an oral story for his two daughters on a long road trip.  When he was finally finished, they encourage him to write it down in book-form as it was better than almost any book that he read to them each night.<br /><br />This story is about a group of rabbits. But unlike many fantasies, these rabbits don't do anything they wouldn't normally do except to talk to each other and other animals.  Brother rabbits Hazel and Fiver live happily in Sandleford Warren, until Fiver has a premonition that something terrible is going to happen to their home.  They convince a group of rabbits to flee Sandleford and seek a new and safer warren.  The rabbits go through many travails and Adams details them all in great detail.  Perhaps the most dangerous expedition involves the search for female rabbits to help populate their new warren.  The rabbits have their own language, Lapine, and Adams provides a glossary of Lapine terms at the end.  This edition also includes a new introduction where the author tells how he came to write this book.<br /><br />I'm not much of a fantasy reader, but I grew very fond of Hazel, Fiver and their companions.
0061537934|5.0|I would call this a perfect novel for the following reasons.<br />1.

0930289234|3.0|Wow, Time Magazine 100 top novels. Basis for Major Movies. The work that changed a genre.  I had to read this book.  Well, after finishing I realize I really didn't have to read it.  I figure this book is like Fried Chicken.  If you have a passion for Fried Chicken you will attempt to elevate it to the level of fine dining.  But sorry its just fried chicken full of grease and salt and thats what makes it good. you should be happy for whatever merit there is in that.  This is a competent comic book for a mature audience.  It has mediocre artwork, the characterizations are thin and often poorly reasoned. But gosh its got some gory violence, space monsters and even a competent love scene.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Our fascination with British history continues as we watched Elizabeth and the gorgeous sequel, Elizabeth the Golden Years. Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called \\"The Virgin Queen\\" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.    She was the daughter of Henry VIII, born to Anne Boleyn, who reigned for a short period of time as Queen but was executed when Elizabeth was at the early age of three years old. As a result of her mother's history, Elizabeth was considered an illegitimate heir to the throne. Elizabeth is sent to London Tower under suspicion of supporting rebels of the Protestant faith, but she never confesses to the accusations that placed her there, and when Mary, her half sister dies, Elizabeth is crowned queen, supported by her Protestant subjects but despised by Catholics.    The movie demonstrates how Elizabeth, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, surrounds herself with great counsel and trusted advisers, among them William Cecil, the Baron of Burghley. One of the first acts as queen is to establish the English Protestant church and she becomes its Supreme leader. From the outset of her reign there is great pressure for Elizabeth to marry and produce an heir to the throne, but for many reasons you shall witness while watching the movie, she never marries and hence, she is known as the Virgin Queen. Thanks to the superbly loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, Elizabeth is able to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and she is able to check mate all attempts against her.    The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur has followed every detail to provide authenticity as to the architecture and decorations of the time. The movie is superb, the filming exquisite, and we see locations that are simply... magnificent. Don't miss it!

B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Our fascination with British history continues as we watched the gorgeous sequel to Elizabeth I, \\"The Golden Years.\\" Elizabeth I lived from September 7th, 1533 until March 24th, 1603. She was called \\"The Virgin Queen\\" and was the fifth and last person to reign from the Tudor dynasty.    Elizabeth I, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett, is more moderate than her father. The movie continues to create great suspense as we learn more about the latter years of her reign. Her loyal aide Walsingham, played in grand style by Geoffrey Rush, continues to help the monarch to uncover every plot to destroy her reign and Elizabeth is able to check mate all attempts against her.    The extra features provide interviews with the producer and we learn that Shekhar Kapur added amazing detail to provide authenticity as to the battle between England and Spain, and they build a ship that is half Armada, half British, then PC replicated, providing awesome battle scenes. The architecture and decorations of the time are exquisite, filming where construction is actually taking place, and dressing in period clothing all construction workers, so the reality is magnificent.     In this film we see a monarch that is now experienced but confronting great challenges because her Catholic cousin, Mary Stuart is after her throne and upon her death, Spain sees the opportunity to attack England under the disguise that she has executed an anointed queen. We see the relationship the queen has with Sir Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen, who brings unique gifts from the new discovered lands of Virginia, named in honor of the Queen. His masterful knowledge of the seas provides great insight to Elizabeth during the defeat of the Spanish Armada.    One of the most spectacular scenes is where the Queen is on her horse, encouraging the people of England to fight to death if necessary to keep England free from foreign domination.  As with the first installment, Elizabeth is simply superb, don't miss seeingthis movie!

Most cds contain these things in a little booklet inside a four sided cover.

Whats up with this?  Is this the future of cds--to save money and not include this information?  I hope not,  This is why I do not download any cds--I want to have this information right on the cover or inside.  I am sure other collectors would agree.
0930289234|4.0|I, like many others, purchased this book after seeing the preview for the movie.  I had heard about this but never gave it much thought.  Unlike Sin City and V for Vendetta, I decided that this time I will actually read the material before I watch the movie.  Well, I have to day it's not at all what I expected and now I'm not so sure I want to watch the movie at all.<br /><br />For anyone who's going to use this review as their basis for deciding wheather or not they are going to read Watchmen, let me start by telling you that this is a thinking piece, not an action piece.  It does have some action, but it's pretty sparse (though it is entertaining when it comes about.)  Watchmen is more of a character drama, and considering the graphic medium, the characters are fairly complex and interesting.  Each one has their own unique story and reasoning behind becoming a \\"costumed adventurer,\\" aptly named due to the fact that with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, they don't have any true super powers.  I am very impressed that Moore never included any character \\"thought text\\" to tell you what they were thinking.  He manages to do it all with dialogue, facial expressions and situations.<br /><br />I was drawn in from the very beginning.  The book wastes no time as it starts with the murder of a long time costumed hero and an ensuing investigation by his former colleagues.  We are introduced to these retired heroes one at a time with plenty of snippets of back story to explain how it all came about and why in this alternate reality, costumed heroes are a part of everyday life.<br /><br />The further I got into Watchmen, the stranger it became and as it ended, I realized it wasn't at all what I thought it would be.  It's almost a study of human character and I'm sure that someone more intelligent than I would be able to pick it apart and analyze it to death, drawing parallels to real life.  I really did enjoy it and I'd recommend it highly, but not to everyone.  There are plentyof readers who don't want to read a book (or more particularly a comic book) for story and characters alone and those readers may not find what the are looking for here.<br /><br />This brings me back to the movie.  I can't really see this story working as a blockbuster Hollywood film.  If they keep the movie very close to the source material -which I hope they will- it's going to be a lot different than people expect.  If they try to appeal to a wider audience and throw in some extra action, they're going to detract from the story and the people who appreciate the book may be dissapointed.  But, so far from what I'm seeing in the preview, it looks like it's going to keep pretty true to the book.  And Dr. Manhattan looks awesome.<br /><br />But this review is about the book, not the movie.  I really liked it.  It may be the best comic book/graphic novel I've ever read.  But, I haven't read any comics since I was a kid and even then not so much.  I don't quite think I'd call Watchmen a masterpiece or compare it to some of the best regular novels I've read, but I liked it.  It's earned a permanent place on my shelf and I look forward to rereading it in the future to see what further tidbits I can get out of it.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Enjoyed this CD.  Good story about Saranden [sic] and her naivette that her husband was \\"dancing,\\".  She suspected an affair and hired a detective. Some comical scenes.  Very good movie.
031606792X|1.0|It has been said many, many times, but this book is a travesty in terms of mechanics, in terms of plot, in terms of story telling, and in terms of respect for the reader. I feel like I've been sucker-punched in the face, because I enjoyed the first three so much, and then-- *BOOM*-- out of nowhere, Breaking Dawn comes and beats me up until I'm crying. Don't subject yourself to unnecessary pain and just pretend that the series ends with Eclipse.
031606792X|5.0|I was a little leary when I started reading this.  Part of me did not want to face the fact the this story was going to be over.  It was hard to get into at first but in the end Stephenie never disapoints.  It was a real good ending.
0061537934|5.0|This book touches all the bases.  It's emotionally moving, very funny, full of technical information about race driving (with lots of metaphorical applications of course), and told almost entirely from a most delightful dog's point of view.  Zo, the dog, muses about his next return as a man, complete with thumbs and a tongue capable of speech.  I found this to be one of the most enjoyable books I've read in the past couple of years.
0385340990|4.0|This is a wonderful book, especially if you have the time to read it at one sitting (as I did) so that you can become thoroughly absorbed in the many fascinating characters.  I hadn't thought of it as a potential for Masterpiece Theatre, as other reviewers here have done, but it is certainly as good as their recent Inspector Foyle series.<br />I really enjoyed the epistolary style and found the letters to be a wonderful way to develop character.  For those who liked this format, Laura Kinsale wrote an excellent book in letter-form.<br />For those who enjoyed the story, the movie EYE OF THE NEEDLE with Donald Sutherland would be a treat.<br />By the way, the authors did a terrific job of contrasting the experiences of the Guernsey Islanders with the Nazis and the bestiality of the Nazis in other parts of Europe.
031606792X|5.0|Everyone is knocking this book because Bella gets everything she wanted and there are no great life lessons in it.  ITS A FREAKING BOOK. ITS ENTERTAINMENT>  If you need YA novels to learn your life lessons then you need to reassess yourself.  This is a great book just like her previous ones. It is fun to read and keeps you glued to the pages.  If you are a super critical person who thinks that every twist should have been different, then go write a book yourself.  Until you do shut the bleep up.
1401200605|4.0|Batman started out as a dark brooding vigilante who had no problem pounding the pavement to get what he wants.  Loeb and Lee seem to capture that flavor in a somewhat convoluted and complex storyline involving yet a new villain who somehow manages to coordinate the lunatics of Gotham (Crock, Poison Ivy, Riddler, Joker, etc., etc.)  In addition we have Catwoman and the strange relationship with Batman taking a new twist.      The story is quite complex.  Batman and Catwoman team up to figure out the connection between a parade of villains and situations that seem a bit unrelated but enough subtle clues to tie in the connections.  Lee's art works extremely well presenting us with broad splash panels and detailed characterizations.  I was impressed but there is an argument to be said for lack of innovation.  This was a monthly when first published and innovation can break deadlines -- I got that.      My only pet peeve is the complexity of the story.  Way too many villains and too many plot twists that make the story impossible in many ways to accept but I was so caught up in the brooding Batman coming to terms with his life that I was able to ignore the ridiculous plot threads that were explained in the end, still feel very contrived.  It's still a terrific read that I found fun.  More streamlined plots would have made the story richer especially with more time spent with Bruce's boyhood friend.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was looking for a short workout for those mornings that I don't have time for the gym.  Since I bought this DVD about a month ago, I have been to the gym only twice.  I really love it.  I really feel challenged and that's just on level 1.      I have two complaints only.   One is that it takes forever to get to the menu.  This is not unique to this DVD, but it drives me crazy.  The second thing is that Jillian can over explain things.  The producers obviously realized this and you can select to just hear the music, but then you really have to watch the video.  Anyhow, those are my only complaints and their minor.      Now if I can just find a 20 minute yoga workout that I like...
B000NIVJHM|3.0|When this movie came out it spawned a hype unlike anything I'd seen before or since.  Full of notable quotables (\\"No one puts Baby in a corner\\"), having not one but two successful soundtracks (one even featuring the one and only published vocal talents of Patrick Swayze the star of the movie!), and a semi camp classic that the famous 80s movies would go down in history for.  Looking back brings so many memories, and so much silliness.    Jennifer Grey plays Baby, a nice Jewish girl who is vacationing with her family in the Catskill mountains.  I can't imagine, even in the times that this movie was set in, that any gal would tolerate being called Baby by her family, let alone be introduced and allow strangers to call her Baby as well, but I guess that was the point.  There she falls for Johnny, the sexy swaggering bad boy of the entertainment staff who dances his way into her innocent, sheltered heart.  Just a little idealistic, just a little far fetched, but just enough of a fantasy to keep things lite and airy.    There werea plethora of subplots (the sister in her own infatuation with the waiter, Johnny's partner needing the abortion, the inevitable confrontation between Baby's father and Johnny, etc.).  The song and dance routines were spaced out in between enough dialogue and plot development to make it otherwise a musical, but not quite.  It's just cheesy enough to make everyone like it.

B00081U7HC|3.0|Hollywood took some of the most ludicris ideas and turned them into gold.  While we have departed from the traditional \\"feel good\\" movie for anyone or anything and have more harsh realities in popular movies, this was one of the last few movies from the 80s / early 90s that made us think anything is possible.  But still, a Hollywood hooker and a cut throat business tycoon?  I guess it could happen.      This was the movie that launched Julia Roberts into superstardom, based on her photogenic appearence and charisma.  Ever since, she has been annoying audiences because she can't seem to launch herself any further than that.  Are we supposed to really believe that the Cinderella story can really be applied to a white collar businessman and a hooker who are holed up in a five star California hotel as the palace?  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts are both so cute and cuddly.  Instead of drug and alcohol abuse they are both clean and sober, cute to look at, and good hearted people at their core rather than the usual sleaze and dysfunction both would be bringing into the situation.      Three stars are for the role of Jason Alexander.  He would rise to his own stardom as the bumbling George Costanza of Seinfeld fame, but to see him play a cut throat white collar businessman who would give a woman a beatdown put him in another light.  Ha ha ha ...
031606792X|5.0|I loved the book.   ***Spoilers ahead***  I loved that Stephenie Meyer did NOT put off the wedding, honeymoon, and Bella becoming a vampire until the end of the book.  I really felt like I understood what it might be like to have the increased senses as a vampire.  People are complaining about the horror of the pregnancy.  What do they expect from a book about vampires?  Blood and torment would naturally be a part of it.  And why is everyone so unhappy about the fairy tale ending?  Haven't so many been screaming for Edward and Bella to be immortal and together forever.  Wouldn't they want Jacob find some way to be happy too?  From the first book, SM set the Volturi up to be a group that could not be beat.  Of course it had to be a mental battle and instead of physical.  They wouldn't have won otherwise.  I do appreciate that Bella finally had her chance to be the one protecting others instead of always being protected.  This is a book I will enjoy many times.

B000002IJO|4.0|The central themes to RATT's \\"Dancing Undercover\\" are mostly these: Have a good time, be sure to have an even better time and, by the way, just have the best time of your life. And all things considered, I suppose there's something a little off kilter with a bunch of macho heavy metal dudes dancing the night away, so perhaps the band was right on target when it named this CD. Thankfully, though, \\"Dancing Undercover\\" is a happy median of sorts for RATT, halfway between the gritty metal pop blast of [[ASIN:B000002IGP Out of the Cellar]] but also showing signs of a more commercial direction that would be overly evident on future records. This is the third of RATT's six studio records, and it really does display the band in fine fighting form and nicely hitting its stride.<br /><br />Stephen Pearcy and the \\"RATT Gang\\" always started their CDs off in a fiery, loud, in-your-face manner, and this album is no exception. \\"Dance,\\" \\"One Good Lover,\\" \\"Drive Me Crazy\\" and \\"Body Talk\\" are all sex-crazed, chorus-heavy and self-explanatory tunes just itching to be played in the nearest 16,000-seat arena. The single \\"Slip of the Lip,\\" meanwhile, is one of RATT's best-ever songs, a slickly worded, truly catchy song that contains honest-to-God groove -- this band's specialty.<br /><br />Rather than coming off as a letdown, \\"Side 2\\" of this CD also boasts great tunes and is, in some ways, a little more musically diverse and interesting. The vibe on the back half of the album is a little less pumped up but the songs are every bit as grabbing -- to the point that they may even exceed the first five songs. Of particular note is another great groover, \\"7th Avenue,\\" but the screw-`em-all attitude heard on \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" is cool, too. \\"Enough is Enough,\\" the final tune, starts off with Pearcy's stark lone voice coupled with an equally isolated guitar. The song, due to its pleading, slightly desperate tone from Pearcy, is oddly touching despite simple lyrics. It's the closest thing to a ballad on this rock-heavy album, and it may just be, surprisingly, the best song within a slew of 10 greats from the mighty RATT.rock-heavy album, and it may just be, surprisingly, the best song within a slew of 10 greats from the mighty RATT.

031606792X|1.0|There's a unique kind of charm to the Twilight series.  It comes mainly from being a series that has created a charming world.  By taking the vampire and werewolf mythology and turning it into something better and even, to an extent, human.  In Twilight we were introduced to Edward, a mystery figure who turned out to be a vampire.  In New Moon, we were introduced to Jacob, a Werewolf, and we learn that both of them have strong affections for Bella.  Eclipse may have been the first mishap by creating an unusually one-sided rivalry between the two that was settled long before that book even began.  Yet, for what it was worth, it wasn't such a bad read.  Breaking Dawn is the finale to the series.  Here Meyer answers all the questions and gives Twilight fans the conclusion they've been waiting for since they broke open the first book in 2005.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn begins right where Eclipse left off.  Just days before Bella and Edward's wedding.  It takes a moment for the book to get going, but once we've bypassed the wedding, Meyer takes the book from seeming like it should be within the Twilight saga and turns it into something bizarre.  It begins just fine, but as we get further into the book you get the feeling that it no longer wants to be a Young Adult series.  This is shown by Bella's passion to want to sleep with Edward.  While Meyer never describes the event itself, we get the idea that Edward must be wild in bed.  He slashes pillows and even destroys the headboard.  For reasons Meyer never explains, Bella can't even seem to remember.  It's when Bella finally gets pregnant that the story begins on a downward spiral.  It not only turns into a story of an unknown demon spawn, but some of its moments are a little too bizarre... even for the Twilight series.  Was it really Meyer who wrote this book?  Not only is the story a little uninteresting, but Meyer also makes many of the same common mistakes she's always made.<br /><br />The first big mistake is how Meyer's still continues to have one-dimensional unbelievable characters.  When Bella discovers she's got an unexpected visitor, she stays with the Cullen's.  This was fine, what I didn't understand was after the Cullen's told Charlie he couldn't come and see her (for different reasons) we're actually expected to believe he'll simply sit there rather than marching down to the Cullen's home and demanding to know what's going on with his daughter?  What kind of father IS Charlie, exactly?<br /><br />Bella has become an increasingly uninteresting character, and Breaking Dawn shows her at her most uninteresting.  In part because Bella never really... develops.  Throughout the entire series she's been this helpless, needy damsel in distress.  We never see Bella grow into her own.  She's essentially the same character we've always seen.  She's just downright unbelievable.  She never seems to struggle with whether or not she wants to become a vampire.  She's only dead set on the fact that she wants to.  There's no internal struggle by Bella herself on anything she does.  In most saga's the main character usually grows to empower himself or herself.  This doesn't happen to Bella.  Even by Breaking Dawn's conclusion, she never grows as a character.<br /><br />Edward is just the same.  He continues to be the ultra selfless, yet somehow controlling man in Bella's world.  He's almost too selfless for his own good here as he makes an unusual proposal to Jacob.  Edward has never been a great character in the realm of fiction.  He's a fantasy that most girls seem to want, but in terms of being a character in a book he's hard to like.  Much of what he has done through the entire series has seemed unnatural or strange.  Breaking Dawn just about pushes this limit.<br /><br />Jacob seems to be the only character holding on throughout the entire saga.  He may not be \\"the one\\" for Bella, but at least of all the characters he's the only one that seems somewhat real.  Like a guy someone could relate too.  Unfortunately, he ends up being a character that's a little too overdramatic for his own good.  The teen angst in this story is taken to new heights.  Not to mention that Bella continues to treat Jacob like... well... a dog.  Jacob is the closest to a believable character we're going to get in this saga, even if he isn't better for Bella than Edward, he is at least, a more interesting and believable character.<br /><br />Another thing Meyer's suffers from is her writing itself.  A lot of the language, including dialog and internal thoughts, comes off as one giant soap opera rather than an absorbing story.  This has always been a problem with the Twilight books, but Breaking Dawn is by far the most annoying about it.  Jacob is more overdramatic than Bella throughout his portion of the book.  But it isn't so much the sappy, overdramatic soap opera like language as it is that the book just goes on for a long time.  This is the first time I've ever felt that perhaps Meyer's would've done better to shorten her book by a small amount.<br /><br />Regardless of what you hear, you'll probably pick up Breaking Dawn, but the story isn't exciting.  There's no giant mystery.  All that's left is for the story to come full circle by showing us things we were merely told in previous books.  Meyer's added a whole new element to the story by making Bella pregnant, but it comes off as being more strange than interesting.  Not to mention some of the pain she goes through while carrying the child, as well as some of things she must do to nurture the baby.  Much of it comes off as more disturbing than actually adding to the story.<br /><br />If you were bothered by the lack of realism in the series before, get ready for it to go all out bizarre in Breaking Dawn.  The last three books, while being a bit unbelievable in their own right, were at least charming and likable.  They were also good stories, even when lacking in the character department.  Breaking Dawn, however, loses that charm by just being too bizarre, and neglecting to bring any of the characters into their own.  As a result, the story suffers more than usual because it isn't just bizarre, but much of it just comes off as implausible.  Even for Meyer's world.<br /><br />In the end you'll probably pick up the book no matter what anyone says.  But it's hard to slog through.  If you can get past all the implausibility and the over the top strange plot, you may like Breaking Dawn.  But if you were bothered by some of the series faults to begin with, you'll more than likely dislike this book.

031606792X|2.0|You know how I said when I wrote the review of Twilight that I was happy that my friends finally got me to read it? Not so much now. Twilight was fine, a nice novel that had lots of potential. I liked New Moon okay too, except for the parts where Bella would be stupid (but isn't she always). I read Eclipse too, but I observed something fundamental in the course of my readings: with each book, the quality and wording and all-around plot got worse in worse. After reading Eclipse I considered not even buying Breaking Dawn, because if I wrote the Twilight Saga, I would have had the characters all mature, and grow, and develop, and some actually true action in all the novels. Now I just finished Breaking Dawn. It has been advised to calm down before you write this review, and even though I knew what would happen days before I actually got the book, my opinion is still the same: Stephenie Meyer made a horrible error in publishing this book.    **Spoilers! Don't read unless you are like me!**         My biggest issue with the book was the character development and their out-of-written-characterness. I wanted Bella to have trouble in her first year of vampirehood, I wanted her to get all smart at Dartmouth, I wanted her to finally choose. I have never in my course of reading wanted a character to suffer, but this is the first time. In the end Bella gets everything she wants: Edward and his love, Jacob's closeness, being a vampire, a baby, Charlie in her life. EVERYTHING. No one in this book really suffers. I read in a how-to-write book one time that in order to make a book good, you need to make your characters suffer, even if they don't get a happy ending. Totally true. I love happy endings, but in this book it was not wanted nor plausible. It wasn't deserved.       Which leads me to my second point: Renesmee. I'm not even going to get into one of those biology talks. The name is bad (evil Rosalie for encouraging Bella!) and overall Renesmee was not needed. SMeyer said that she imagined the baby since the beginning of the saga. No way! If that was true, then she could have just skipped Eclipse and all the talks in there. She goes against everything she has ever talked about in the book. She said it was impossible for her to finish with just three books, she needed this one. No she didn't.       And where did Leah go? She had all this hope inside her. I wanted Jacob to talk about her more. She had real potential as a character. And in general, the whole third part of the book only had to do with Renesmee and Bella and Edward, no sign of everyone else. Alice wasn't as good friends with Bella as before, and now Rosalie is tied to the hip with Bella. What? I do feel bad for Rosalie though, despite her ulterior motives. She really wanted a baby, and in the end it was again out of reach.       The imprinting thing was wrong, wrong, wrong. It makes Jacob's love for Bella worthless. And with a baby? Yeah I was mad. I wanted him to imprint on one of the vampires. I always imagined it being hilarious if he imprinted on Rosalie. They have that relationship.       And Jazz? Enough said.       It was like the author totally had a brain switcheroo. Where did all her ideas go?       The whole J.Jenks thing had no point at all. Just added on 50+ pages of uneeded stuff. The book was a little too long.       There is so much more, but those are the biggest ones. I saw so many things I wanted to correct.        Whether you are a Fangirl or a Hater, stop fighting! I never thought I would say this, but it's just a book. A bad book however. Stop verbal abusing eachother and just debate. There. That's for me.       I had a thought when I was trying to shove Breaking Dawn onto my bookshelf. I had to take perfectly good books away, and suddenly I just threw BD on the floor. Those other books didn't need to be displaced. I could just save BD's space for a more deserving piece of work. Like the complete Jane Austen novels. That's real romance.       I can't help feel that we have all been sucked in. In Twilight we were sorta entranced, and now we see every character and even the author for what they are. We know they only care about themselves. Even though I am a teen myself, I could see through Edward. The only reason why I stayed onto the series was to see Bella grow as a person. Look where that went.    **Note to the author- Sorry. I don't want to be very harsh, but you could of stuck with 3 books. Or taken another year. We would have waited.
031606792X|5.0|My 17 year old daughter bought Twilight and raved about it.  After reading it, I got hooked on Bella and Edward's love story too. I'm 50 years old.  Before deciding to have children, I chose a career.  I believe in female empowerment and that's why I really loved Breaking Dawn. I've read most of the reviews, especially the critical ones.     A teenage girl falls in love with a vampire and has a werewolf for a best friend. Twilight Series is a modern day fairy tale, nothing more. I'm sure most of us have read Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Rapunzel, or perhaps Little Red Riding Hood??  All three of these deal with moral issues; invasion of privacy and destruction of personal property, a young woman's rites of passage and female \\"purity\\", and talking to strangers. According to Eventide, Breaking Dawn has morals too...EVENTIDE's critical review sums them all up quite well. There's morals to EVERY story, but why always look for one when you could just sit back and enjoy the tale for itself??  That surely didn't stop Goldilocks or the other fairy tales from being popular.  I totally agree with navyblue's review!      (Spoilers)    My expectations of this book were more than satisfied.  I'm so glad that Edward and Bella were able to have a child together.  In the first book Edward said to Bella towards the end of the book, \\"for this to be the twilight of your life, though your life has barely started.  You're ready to give up everything.\\"  He wasn't much older than Bella when he died and Carlisle turned him into a vampire.  In all three books Edward has an issue with being a vampire and most importantly, wondering what will become of him when he finally dies...is it the end for him?  The birth of Renesmee compensates for Edward's and Bella's early death as humans.  They're immortals but are able to experience parts of human sexuality; conception, procreation and parenthood. AND what better way to manifest their deep love for another than having a child?  One critical review maintains that Bella didn't freak when she found out she was pregnant.  She did and it was only when she felt the nudge from her fetus that she was able to put her situation in perspective...she was having a child with Edward, whom she married first!        Bella JUST doesn't get everything she wants.  She has had to suffer.  Wasn't she almost killed?  Didn't Edward leave her for a long time?  I find that her character has evolved.  She turned into a real mother bear when Renesmee was born.  I think she became stronger.  Stephenie Meyer must've believed that her readers would have a hard time getting around Jacob imprinting with Renesmee as well as Quil with Claire.  That's why she refers many times to their relationships with the children as nanny or caregiver.  The concept was a bit strange for me as well, but you just have to be open minded and remember that this only a fairy tale.    I gave Stephenie Meyer's (SM) third book only three stars because the story's development was so long and drawn out with nothing to show in the end.  I LOVE Breaking Dawn!!  I could hardly put it down.  I finished it in two days. It had the happy ever after that I wanted.  SM had a wonderful resolution to all the character's issues in the book.  I will be looking out for any more books she writes about The Cullens, or Edward, Bella and Renesmee
0061148512|3.0|This book was really funny and really honest. But that's what I liked about it.     It was kind of frustrating because you just wanted the main character to snap out of it. I know mental illness is serious and these people cannot help themselves from feeling the way they do, but it was really frustrating because I do not share her same opinions about life and I try really hard not to be so helpless and reliant on other people to fix problems in my life. Also she talks a lot about the burden of being a woman. I think just because women have the challenge of giving birth, it is really a gift of closeness to our mothers and ancestors that nobody can take away.    Just like some people never find real love, I think Sylvia takes her emotions for granted. Like she's supposed to feel great all the time. Being a genius sometimes means being more sensitive and vulnerable to feelings of depression, but that doesn't mean she should give up. Because in the end everyone dies. We're supposed to share our sympathy for humanity, but Sylvia doesn't really care about anybody but herself because she's so alone and afraid to reach out.    All in all, I don't think this book has a positive message. There's a difference between honesty and helplessness. She's kind of helpless.
B000EGDAI4|4.0|While it is undeniable that the catchy theme of \\"St. Thomas\\" has made Saxophone Colossus the most beloved work of Sonny Rollins, the album fairly showcases his improvisational genius. As heard on \\"St. Thomas,\\" Rollins typically begins with cautions and then gradually develops into lyric lines. After the other musicians' solos, Rollins comes back with furious fast phrases before returning to the theme. Among the band members, drummer Max Roach is phenomenal, playing aggressive ad-libs while keeping the beat (especially on \\"Blue 7\\"). His interplays with Rollins are also thrilling (especially on \\"Strode Rode\\"). The variety of tunes, from calypso to Kurt Weill cover to authentic blues, shows Rollins's broad range of interests. Overall, Saxophone Colossus has remained as the most well-known work of his; being overly popular, it might divert the audience's attention from his true talent as a jazz improviser.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|For me, this book redeemed the series.  I am not sure what other readers found so objectionable about this book, but don't listen to them Ms. Meyer, you did good!

0743454537|5.0|This book will break your heart, but it's still well worth the read - just be prepared for the tears that will invariably follow.<br />My Sister's Keeper is the story of Anna, a thirteen-year-old who is suing her parents for medical emancipation. Anna was conceived for the specific purpose of being a medical donor to her sister, Kate, who is dying of leukemia. But after years of constant surgeries and transfusions, Anna has decided that she no longer wants to play the role of guinea pig.<br />There are no right or wrong answers in this book, and Picoult takes great care to show every side of the story, as the book has been written from the perspective of seven different characters. There are no good guys or bad guys - only people trying to make the best choices they can. And this is what makes My Sister's Keeper such a heartbreaking read - you know that the someone's right to choose will lead to someone else's tragedy.<br /><br />Zara Stevens<br />[[ASIN:141967787X Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories]]

But is it so much more than that, the whole story is a metaphor for life and I couldn't put it down.  This story is so artfully told that I have committed many passages to memory.  There were some storylines that were tense; but again, so is life.      Buy the book, you will not be disappointed.  And keep a pen for underlining and a box of Kleenex close by.
031606792X|4.0|This book provided great characters, romance, entertainment and eroticism.  During these hard economic times, I read these books to escape the harsh realities of the world.      Twilight was the strongest book in the series.  Eclipse had a great showdown against a formidable enemy.    Breaking Dawn was not perfect, but the author has a gift for story telling and dialogue.  I was completely entertained and transported to Forks, WA, while I read it.  Stephenie Meyer does the following creative writing very well: the mind reading dialogue, the inner voices of the werewolves, the humor between the werewolves, the sensory input when Bella becomes a vampire, the family chemistry of the Cullens.  Ms. Meyer's writing is intensely erotic, particularly when Bella and Edward cannot consummate their relationship.  That's talent!!     I would have preferred a decisive victory over the Voultari, that still respected Carlisle's pacifism.  However, there is room for one more book in this series and I hope that the Cullens and their allies finally defeat the Voultari.      I had no trouble whatsoever with Jacob imprinting on Renesmee'.  The author firmly established in Eclipse that it is not sexual at all, while she is still a child. So what if he once fantasized about Bella, he had no choice in the imprinting.  Now, she and Jacob are back to being best friends, which works for them.    The author did not glorify teen-age motherhood or choosing immortality: Bella, Edward and the Cullens suffered horribly through the pregnancy.  Edward had no choice but to make Bella immortal, since she was clinically dead at the end of the delivery.  And it nearly did not work.  Then Bella suffered for 3 days as she turned into a vampire.    I posted this review to counter some unfair criticisms against the book and author.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|I would give the Matrix 5 stars, Matrix Reloaded 3 and Matrix Revolutions 1 or 0 if it were a choice.  I can't possibly stomach spending $90 to purchase the first movie. IMO, the only one worth buying on blu-ray (since I already own it and \\"Reloaded\\" on DVD).  The first film was a pioneer and was awesome in its storyline, suspense, action sequences, and special effects!  Also, the original marketing campaign for this movie was one of the best I've ever seen (or not seen ;-) )  Everything was hush hush and there weren't any spoilers in the original trailers. I went into this movie the first weekend it was out with \\"What is the Matrix?\\" as my only knowledge of the film.  Unfortunately, the franchise was all down hill after the first installment.  The second movie was good in that it had some interesting foreshadowing, great action sequences and the Merovingian was an interesting character.  Unfortunately, there wasn't even near the suspense and discovery of the first movie.  It had an Empire Strikes Back sense to it, but Neo was basically already a master of his powers so his \\"hero's journey\\" didn't have much arc to it. The whole situation with \\"the architect\\" at the end was so confusing (which it was meant to be) that it had everyone shaking their heads in bewilderment.  Matrix Revolutions was by far the most disappointing installment of a trilogy movie franchise that I've ever seen!  The final movie was absolutely absurd liberal nonsense.  \\"The war is over!  The War is over!\\"  Yeah, the machines aren't defeated, they just have agreed (for now) not to wipe every unassimilated human off the face of the earth (what's left of it).  So Trinity and Neo had to die for this!???  No victor, no right and wrong, just coexistence?  WHAT A BUNCH OF LIBERAL CRAPPOLA!!!  Then the Wachowski brothers follow this up with an even worse movie ~ \\"Speed Racer\\".  BUT, thats another review for another time.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I liked the movie, but I don't understand why the director deviated so much from the plot-line and characters in the book. I read the book after seeing the movie and I was shocked at how different they were. I liked the story-line in the book a lot more than the movie - especially the ending.
B001CXW8CW|5.0|Batman has now entered the hallowed halls of cinematic legends. Not only it's smashing box office records worldwide, it's also THE film to catch this year.     Chris Nolan has finally arrived at the A-list with this writhing and heart-wrenching cinematic outing. You couldn't ask for more from a superhero movie. No other superhero has ever aimed for this astronomical height of cinematic autuer brilliance. Spider-man 2, X2, Iron Man and even Superman Returns have tried but still fall short. There is still no pizzazz. Bryan Singer, Brett Ratner and Sam Raimi should see this film over and over and over, take notes and then try to improve on their film craft.    Acting as a one-man show behind the scenes, Chris Nolan not only directed this film, he's also in charge of second unit direction (normally given to others) and he shares screenwriting credit with his brother. Both brothers have churned out equally smart and enigmatic scripts together: Memento and The Prestige. With this film, both brothers have sealed themselves as part of Hollywood legend.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" opens with a brooding establishing shot of Gotham City. The shot is somewhat reminiscent of 2019 Los Angeles of Blade Runner (Chris Nolan's favourite film). With a two-note soundtrack that sounds like chalk board screeching, the opening shot has already set the tone for the bleakest and most intelligent superhero movie ever made.    A nod to Michael Mann's \\"Heat\\", the opening bank heist is shot in a brisk and efficient manner, even William Ficthner made a brief cameo as a bank manager once again. Here, the sociopathic criminal known as The Joker reveals his visage under a clown guise. The Joker is a fully developed character on its own. The late Heath Ledger disappears under his skin and emerges one of cinema's most memorable villians, alongside Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vadar.    Sloppy, filthy, face caked with inche-thick makeup and a permanent scar from ear to ear, the Joker's face is something to behold. Even the voice and mannerism captured by Heath Ledger is something of a genius. This is obviously a maniac under the guise of a criminal genius.     Instead of making the Joker a stereotypical supervillian, Nolan chose to make him a sociopath with a set of code and honour followed very strictly, something that would even please Atticus Finch. However, his downright dementia might trascend the vileness and the evil that transpires, as he says near the end of the film: \\"A little social experiment\\". From a sociologist's point of view, the man's work, neferious and evil, it may seem, serves to prove a point: Everyone has a breaking point.    Taking a cue from Alan Moore's \\"The Killing Joke\\", the Joker wants to see if anyone could be driven insane based on \\"a very bad day\\" that happens on a person. The unfortunate victim here is Harvey Dent (a casting coup, Aaron Eckhert). To a certain extent, Bruce Wayne as well.    Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is indeed a tortured soul. Filled with moral ambiguities and ethos that is akin to the Joker's anarchic and chaos theory. Both hero and villian are essentially mirror images of each other. The Batman universe could not really exist, with one another co-existing and feeding off each other.     Bruce Wayne may very well be a schizophrenic. Under the guise of Batman, he becomes a totally different creature. A vigilante in the same sense that Harry Callahan and Paul Kersey. Gritty to the max, unafraid of consequences to self and others around them, and eventually, by the end of the film, everyone in the protagonist's world is somehow affected by the touch of evil (Kersey's family is practically wiped out, Dirty Harry loses a partner in almost all his \\"adventures\\")    Taking matters into their own hands and thus sealing one's own fate seems to be a common theme in \\"The Dark Knight\\". Batman is not afraid to break someone's legs, Dent continues the duality theme and turned vigilante, the Joker, just being the Joker, takes everythinginto his own hands.     By the end of this depressing film, the denouement offers a silver lining in its dark, gloomy clouds. Bruce Wayne allows himself to be the sacrificial lamb for the sake of the moral fiber of Gotham City. If this sounds too deep, you would have to see the whole haunted film first, before the true meaning of the title \\"The Dark Knight\\" hits home. By doing so and allowing the whole city to defile his heroic guise, Bruce Wayne has indeed metamorphosized into Gotham City's Dark Knight. Always there to protect its innocent but at the same time, being reviled by the very ones he has sworn to protect.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is a sheer delight. Fully drawn characters and historical information, biblical themes and engaging drama make this a wonderful read. I highly recommend this book. Don't be intimidated by the length; it is fast reading.
B000SQJ27I|2.0|It's not a fun listening, the songs are not authentic as on his two earlier albums, but rather annoying.
B00008IAMD|5.0|It's true what many have said about this album, that Cash takes the songs and makes them his own.  They don't feel like covers at all, even though the songs are familiar, especially for young people and baby boomers, with songs like \\"Hurt,\\" \\"Personal Jesus,\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\"  I would definitely share this album with those who appreciate Johnny Cash--young and old alike.  The songs are haunting and introspective.  They seem to convey an underlying awareness of human mortality and vulnerability, yet their power and clarity is derived from this sense. This feeling is what remains with the listener long after the listening.
B000I5YR42|5.0|...the title track.<br /><br />At 60 minutes, this lies as my 2nd favorite song of all time (keep in mind that just because it's long doesn't mean it's good), and is an epic I can listen to the whole way through. Probably the best song they've released. I like the opera singer part 32 minutes in, and how the song's last 5 minutes end with a heavy bang. The progressiveness truly counts, and yet the whole song is amazing. Overall, if you are a fan, buy this.
031606792X|5.0|Instead of writing why I loved this book so much, I feel the need to defend Meyers to all those people who trashed this book.  Wow! Hopefully the masochistic people who gave it 1 star were just more vocal at first than those of us that loved it.   In no way do I worship Meyers, or think that the book is absolutely perfect --but it was AMAZING and Stephenie is a wonderfully gifted and talented writer. Breaking Dawn did not disappoint in any way, and was a beautiful and mind-blowing way to end the saga.   I appreciated her creativity, her love and passion for the characters, and her neat portrayal of Bella, Edward, and Jacob.   My hope is that Meyers will write a new series of books based on Jacob and the person he imprinted on. =)
B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney came out BIG! \\"Whitney Houston\\" was best selling album in the U.S. of 1986. Three singles became No.1-Hits (still rare coming from one album). She received Grammy nomination for \\"Album of the Year\\". And she won for the touching performance \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" (one of the best singles about \\"the other woman\\"). The singles were well picked as they show the amazing range Whitney had. She's known for ballads but the interesting thing is songs like \\"How Will I Know\\" (cheesy 80s pop at its most fun) showed she could other things. My favorite song on the album is \\"You Give Good Love\\". I just love the opening! It's a R&B groove that gave mainstream audiences a first listen to her wonderful voice. I almost forgot \\"Greatest Love of All\\" (originally sung by the amazing George Benson). I don't care if it seems cliché; I think the lyrics are empowering and still relevant. The production does age it (I've never heard the version with the piano rather than the keyboard) but it's still a lovely song.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Fasten your seatbelts. This trip through the Stargate is a bumpy ride.<br /><br />Okay, I'll confess that I bought Continuum because I needed a Stargate SG-1 fix. Since my beloved series traveled through that final wormhole after 10 fantastic years, I miss them. I'd have bought this movie regardless of what reviews might have said because I wanted to hang with the team again. Therefore, I was thrilled when the movie wasn't just watchable but was a well-plotted story filled with great characters who make you believe they really are a go-to team capable of saving the earth from destruction.<br /><br />Full of twists and turns, the production values of Continuum make you feel as if you're watching a big-screen theatrical release rather than a made for video spinoff of a television series.<br /><br />I won't spoil the surprises, but they are many and they're well-thought out and make you easily suspend disbelief. Get it and prepare for a thrill ride that doesn't depend on your being a former fan. But if you were a fan of the intrepid space explorers, you'll really enjoy this edge of your seat story.
B000O179EK|4.0|The first time I seen this was not long ago and I couldn't stop laughing. Great classic with great actors. I think just about anybody could enjoy this movie. Nothing but fun and laughs. Definitely worth is at the price on HD DVD.
055358894X|4.0|If you consider a book based on how it makes you want to keep reading, then I'll give this one full marks. My main issue with it, however, was excessive exposition. This, I'll admit, might just be my own issue. I tend not to like a lot of descriptive verbiage and this one has pages and pages of it that I basically skimmed.<br /><br />I thought the main story was interesting and generally well laid out. The author did a lot of flashing back and forth in time, especially early in the book, to provide the back story on certain elements. Some of it I didn't think were necessary or useful at all, but some was helpful. The main character (Locke Lamora) was one that definitely grew on me. He is both crafty and heroic, despite being perhaps a less than heroic sort of character.<br /><br />Overall, I'll call it a pleasant read, though as yet I have not decided whether I'd buy another book by the author.
0743529030|3.0|This is the first review I have written, but I felt that I should warn the public.  This audiobook is awful.  I have over 40 self-training audiobooks from all the top names and this one is last on the list.  This is the only audiobook I have ever stopped listening to.<br /><br />It's not that the content is useless, but the presentation is like reading a to-do list of things to mention without going into any interesting detail about any one of them.  He will say things like \\"try to see things from the other person's point of view\\" \\"work to smile when uncomfortable\\" \\"concentrate on how you could do it better\\"  Sure that is good advice, but the 3/4 I stomached was like listening to a series of fortune cookie lines.<br /><br />I'd suggest work from Tony Robbins, Earl Nightengale, David Bach, Robert Allen and Zig Ziglar if you want to get your money's worth.<br /><br />edit: I gave it three stars instead of the original one because there is valuable content in here, subtracted two because it (in audio form) is essentially reading list after list and does not leave lasting value like authors who are better at conveying a message in a lasting way.
031606792X|3.0|I understand the qualms that many people have about Breaking Dawn.  Certainly this ending is not what I anticipated, and not necessarily what I would have chosen.  But to those who find it offensive, or think that it sends girls the wrong message, consider: this book reflects the author's perspective.  Like my best friend, Stephenie Meyer is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon).  Mormon girls frequently wed at a younger age than the average girl.  The Mormon couples I know stick together for the long run, and their families seem very close.  Therefore, these choices are good for them, though they are not for everyone (including me).  That does not cover all perceived flaws in the final book, but I do think it helps explain why the series ended as it did.  This is Stephenie's idea of a happy ending.
031606792X|5.0|I just finished the book last night.  I loved it.  Thought that the path Stephanie Meyers took with the characters was ingenious.  Didn't see it coming.  Loved her writing, her creativity and her ability to get me so emotionally involved that I had severally sleepless night worrying about Bella and her family.  I am glad that it wasn't predictable.  I have never had so many different emotions come up in one book from happiness to complete and utter fear.  I loved the first few chapters.  I thought Edward and Bella's honeymoon was beautiful.  I am so proud that Stephanie maintained the character of the Cullun family who would avoid killing if at all possible and was able resolve their conflict with that in mind.  I loved the way Bella's evolved.  You could really feel the change from the sweet innocent, clumsy Bella to the confident, beautiful woman she became.  I can hardly wait to start it again tonight!!!
0385340990|4.0|The odd title and a brief NPR blurb caused me to select and read this book.  The word \\"literary\\" in the title made me a bit anxious since books labeled literature seem so often seem to be books that only an English teacher could love.  Another concern was the book's format: it is almost entirely a series of letters to and from the main character, Julia Ashton; I was worried that this format would produce a fragmented narrative (I never cared for Dos Pasos).  Despite my initial worries, I found the book to be a brisk and pleasant read.<br /><br />The novel centers on the lives of an interesting assortment of Guernsey islanders.  Guernsey has only recently been liberated from Nazi occupation and the events that occurred during the nightmare of occupation are still fresh in their minds.  Their story is slowly revealed to us through letters written to Ashton or recounted by Ashton in letters to her friends.  An important secondary plot involves the changes that Ashton herself is undergoing as she starts to create a new life from the rubble of her own wartime experiences in London and begins to be absorbed by the lives of the islanders.<br /><br />The letters sparkle and the personalities of the various writers shows through in each; they are truly gems from an era when letter-writing was an art.  It would have been easy for the book to be a collection of loosely-related snapshots requiring the reader to smooth over the narrative gaps. However, the authors have carefully crafted the letters so that they form an intricate yet complete web of plots and subplots: each letter left me anxious to get the answers to the questions posed by previous letters.  The result was a well-paced novel--this judgment is from a reader whose main diet is mysteries and SciFi.  I have no reservations at all about recommending this book
0316010669|5.0|This book is a great buy and the seller is very good.  Lightning fast shipping.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I watched this movie in three parts because I just didn't want it to end.  If you're a Stargate fan, then you'll feel like you're seeing old friends and the movie is just too short for a good reunion at any length.  It's very well done, and it made me laugh and get a tear in my eye and also suprised me in places. Having lived in the COLD(Nome, not WAY THE HELL UP THERE), it was enjoyable to see the \\"Making of\\" featurettes, and I have to say it was as enjoyable as the movie. Being a Ben Browder fan, I loved the hair this time, Is it different?... or is it just me?  I had a hard time accepting him even with my LOVE of him after I watched the episodes to familiarize myself with the show when he came on because I fell in love with the O'Neil character.  In this movie and when I watch season 9-10 now, I'm HEARING his character and laughing because the writers gave him some funny ____to say, but I couldn't hear him for the comparisons I was making.  My Bad! What an impossible job to come in a replace the lead!  I especially loved seeing the characters settle into their new lives. Daniel Jackson calling himself was a touching scene. It was refreshing since it isn't always possible to 'relax' with a series time-frame. This might be a more feminine point of view...since some other reviewers might have enjoyed more action. I love action too, but often miss more 'personal' moments. I hope the fact that I had to got to 3 stores to find it(because they were sold out) is a huge incentive to make more Stargate movies.  I'll be believing!  Thanks for those two!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I believe I have some insight into this whole aspect ratio controversy. For many years, filmmakers filmed movies in something called \\"Super 35.\\" The final, unedited and uncropped raw footage looks something like the old Chevrolet symbol, in that each scene was framed in both widescreen AND fullscreen ratios. The widescreen crop, of course, was released to theaters, but the fullscreen crop was released for home video consunption. I believe this to be the case with \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" as I have compared both the 2002 and 2008 versions, and information is both gained and lost in both incarnations, depending on the crop. It is no longer necessary to practice this hybrid process because of the proliferation of 16:9 TVs, so \\"Super 35\\" has virtually vanished.  However, this new version of LD is FAR superior to the first release, because of the stunningly clean, richly textured and colored, widescreen picture and the much improved sound. It's even more jaw-dropping than it's original edition - which is saying something. Throw in the letter-perfect performances by all(but ESPECIALLY so by Duvall and Jones)and you have an unqualified masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and check out the greatest western of all time, and one of the top 2 or 3 films ever made. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I bought this cd as something to listen to when I went on a trip to Paris. Like for the plane, or around the city. Well I listened to it a little bit and then barely listened to it at all. I was mad at myself for buying something that I didn't really want. Well, as of recently, I have been listening to it more and more. Right now I'm listening to it. haha.     I really like the songs, \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" \\"A-Punk\\" \\"Mansard Roof\\" \\"M79\\" and \\"Campus\\" The other songs are still growing on me. :)    Bottom Line : It's a really good cd and it mixes so many different styles. It really sounds African at sometimes, which is totally weird but awesome. The lyrics are at times complex, funny, and true. I really recommend this cd to anyone who wants to try something different and amazing! :D
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews that were about the the possible messages in  this book that might or might not have been achieved by the end of the fourth book. I have difficulty understanding why anyone would believe that this book has to have a message beyond just a fun way to spent a few hours totally occupied with a fun read. I have a lot of stuff going on in my life that needs a lot of thinking and concentrating.....sometimes I just like to relax and be entertained.....I totally was..... Vivi
031606792X|5.0|I started the Twilight-series two weeks ago and read all of the four books straight through. I like the ending, I like the way Meyer wrapped up everything nicely, I like that it has the best ending it could have and there is much love in it - family love, brotherly love, the profound love between Bella and Edward and above all that love is the key to success, to survival, to overthrow enemies (it's also in Harry Potter).   (Spoiler alert) Some reviewers condemn that Bella in the end gets everything she wants but this is because she loves all around her unconditionally, she always thinks about saving the others, sacrifizing herself so that others can go on living (I found that quite annoying when she was still human). Suddenly she has the power to do it without sacrifizing herself. She always thought herself so insignificant, but she is rewarded for her decency.     The message is that love survives all hardships and danger, that if in a family or in a relationship you stay true to one another, you are able to  have it all.   And of course it cannot be like real life. It's not the job of books or films to immitate real life, they never will be able to. It's to show us an ideal to which we can strive to, which we might never reach but which we can work towards.   And Jacob: I didn't see this coming, but it fits so perfectly because otherwise he would never have been able to stay away from Bella, although he seems to abandon her again. And he ends up with part of her, which is just so right.

031606792X|3.0|I thought this book was \\"ok\\".. not as good as her other books and had a different feel to it. I kept thinking \\"get on with it\\" in many places. It seemed it was stretched out for way too long.  But what irritated me the most.. and I see this in ALL of her books, is there are so many grammatical errors... I read a lot of books and rarely do I see errors like I see in her books.  Missing quotes... misspelled words... words that are flipped with other words.. You would think that with the money she makes off these books she could afford to hire somebody who can properly check her work.  And it's not just this book, it's \\"The Host\\" as well. So, Stephenie if you are reading this, fire that person and hire a new one! It's embarrassing really..
B00005JNJV|4.0|Finally a version of Batman that seems made for adults instead of children. A decent plot and villains that are not completely over the top. My only complaint would be that most of the scenes in Gotham city are too dark. All in all, an enjoyable action movie to show how the Batman legend begins.

For teachers, it is an excellent reference book when planning a class (be it beginning, continuing or advanced). For students, it contains a wealth of information that I have not previously found in any single volume. Highly, highly recommended.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I had not seen this movie since it first came out and it is still a superb movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. As a child, I can recall news articles about Gandih. But like most of us, as a child things going on around you don't actually sink in. But this movie re-awakened a very important part of world history for me.
0743289692|5.0|Succinctly put, Ayaan Hirsi Ali is one courageous lady. She overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to escape the persecution of islam in her native Somalia and become a free woman, a Dutch citizen, and a member of the Dutch Parliament.<br /><br />For people who have been lulled into thinking that islam is a religion of peace, some serious rethinking is in order. Granted, as practiced, islam varies somewhat from country to country--some being worse than others--but the ignorance, warfare, barbarism, horrible treatment of women, hatred of everything and everyone un-moslem, and blame-everyone-else attitude all seem to be prevalent everywhere in the islamic world. Ayaan vividly tells of this--not from research but from her own life experiences.<br /><br />If you want to read an amazing story of literal slavery to liberty, you must read this book. Once you get within the first few pages, if you are anything like me, you will have a difficult time putting it down until you have finished.
0062515675|5.0|I Had previously read the book  and I loved it so much that  I bought it from Amazon.com. It is an excellent book to have on your night table and a tool to implement good things into your life. Certainly brings you enlightment and help to improve your life!
0060589469|5.0|I re-read this book after about 15 years and enjoyed it just as much as the first time, but I got something different out of it this time too.    This book has a great calming effect on me.  It's so interesting on so many subjects, and so accesssible.  This is such a relevent read.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|No matter what you believe is the \\"real\\" story regarding the Boleyn family, this movie was based on the book by Phillipa Gregory and followed very closely to it.  The book is very dense and packed with various events and drama but the movie could only capture but so much in its two hour alotted timeframe and in my opinion it captured the main points of the book. I read the book before I saw the movie and I must say the actors did a wonderful job bringing the characters to life.  I found it entertaining and well directed.  Definitely not a five star movie,  but it got the job done!
B000GIXEIG|2.0|I see why this had mixed reviews and didn't make it to the American screens, the views of iceland were amazing however.<br /><br />The storyline plods along though and it makes you end up asking who cares about why Grendel is attacking these people and even less about the \\"big secret\\" at the end. Which is obvious if you don't fall asleep mid-way through.<br /><br />I was asking myself why the Polly actress, couldn't do some type of decent accent while in the movie.<br /><br />I am assuming she was a friend of the director and it was a free trip to a cool locale like Iceland! (love her in dawn of the dead, fyi!!)
B000A2H9BQ|5.0|Bless The Weather is arguably John Martyn's finest recording moments on vinyl (as it was then). What this album manages to achieve is the near perfect blend of contemporary folk music and jazz, and with John's wonderfully expressive vocals, he just can barely put a foot wrong here. The atmosphere of the whole album is laid back, but at the same time completely manages to grip the listener from start to finish.<br /><br />'Go Easy' is the ideal opener, has a real lazy feeling to it and sets up the whole mood for the album. 'Bless The Weather' demonstrates the perfect fusion of jazz and folk. Danny Thompson, a veteran UK jazz double bassist, who accompanies John Martyn has a strong presence here and features on most of the other tracks. In fact much of the time during the '70s he was the only musician to accompany Martyn on stage, and the two of them became great pals. He has a complete empathy for Martyn's guitar playing and music. 'Sugar Lump' is the only disappointment on BTW. It just isn't up to the high quality of the other songs. 'Walk On The Water' adds an xylophone giving a watery feel to the song. 'Just Now' is a sincere and emotional (but never cloying) ballad about relationships, with John on guitar and a very melodic piano as accompaniment, and it closes the first half of the album.<br /><br />'Head And Heart' starts the second half, more upbeat and again strongly features Danny Thompson. This is the most commercial sounding track of the album, but excellent nonetheless. 'Let The Good Times Come' deserves a special mention. It features John's (then) wife and former recording partner, Beverly Martyn. Here she uses her voice as a background instrument. The result is highly startling and effective. 'Back Down The River' is a plain gentle song, just John on his own, short and sweet. We then come to the climax of the whole album, 'Glistening Glyndebourne'. This is a six and a half minute instrumental epic. It starts out building slowly for a couple of minutes with piano, double bass and guitar, before markedly picking up tempo, and adding congas and drums. Martyn for the first time uses Echoplex on his guitar, which adds rhythmic layers of sound to the whole piece, a technique that he was to feature prominently on future recordings. Martyn finally closes out with a short but idiosyncratic version of 'Singing In The Rain'. On its own this track would be questionable, but in context it is a light humoured response to the previous mammoth track and it wraps up the original album beautifully.<br /><br />As usual there are the obligatory bonus tracks, 11-17, but the version of May You Never sounds like it was recorded in the 1980s when John was by then working live with a band. In any case the original version wasn't recorded until John's follow up album to this, Solid Air, so it is out of place here anyway. Personally, with the exception of the alternative take, Glistening Glyndebourne, I would have preferred no other bonus tracks.<br /><br />Apart from this anomaly, the album (the original part) is a true classic.e bass and guitar, before markedly picking up tempo, and adding congas and drums.

031606792X|3.0|I am addicted to the Twilight Series and had high hopes for Breaking Dawn. I was deeply disappointed. Some parts of the book were rushed and the others dragged on forever. It didn't seem like Stephanie Meyer took enough time to make a realistic plotline. The characters didn't act like they did in the previous three books. Edward and Bella's hot romance cooled completely. Instead they focused on their half vamp/half human baby. Finally, the promised conflict with the Volturi never took place. Instead it was replaced with a long diplomatic conversation. It was such a downer. The last 100 pages were so drawn out, with no dramatic climax, no suspense, no nothing. Everything worked out easily. I call \\"Foul\\" to Stephanie Myer. She rushed through writing this book. I did like the beginning, but the book really took a wrong turn in the end.
0743298039|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book and found it difficult to put down. The story has characters that slowly build and are finely written.     The story is reminiscent of a gothic ghost story and the beauty is that the mystery is doled out in parcels. I appreciated the way that the author built the unfolding of the mystery little  by little and had a nice twist at the final revelation.     The interplay between the characters furthers the story and is genuine. You are exposed to a well written description of the times and society.     I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a gothic mystery and can appreciate a story that takes time to build and draw you in.

My second favorite book is Destiny of Souls... there are a lot of good spiritual books on the market but there are not a lot of great ones.  These books are GREAT!

Don't miss this one... this book answers many questions left unanswered by organized religion and it will help you live a rich and meaningful life.
0307269191|5.0|Haruki Murakami offers an extended, albeit concise, meditation on distance running that is both introspective yet absorbing.  Unpretentious and not self-absorbed, Murakami draws interesting parallels between the life of a distance runner and that of a writer, in his specific case, a novelist.      He also offers trenchant insights on the aches and pains of distance running, triathlon competitions and the lifestyle issues that confront those who pursue such pastimes.  Murakami is not in any way attempting to proselytize and his understated style may win many converts nonetheless.    My sole quibble is his bias against walking in marathons.  He wants his tombstone epitaph to read, \\"At least he never walked.\\"  Yet, I firmly believe that there is nothing shameful - either in a race, a training run or a life -- in stopping to walk.  The point is not always the completing time, but the fact that one keeps moving forward, even at a walker's gait.  Sometimes slowing down to a more measured pace is good.      Walk or run to get a copy of this book to read.  If you consider yourself a runner or an endurance athlete - whether it's a journeyman or an elite competitor -- \\"What I Talk About:\\" is a genuine treat and may give you more to talk about, and think about!
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I can't say I have been a fan of Paramore since day one because I had never heard of them until \\"Misery Business.\\" But once I heard them, I couldn't get enough. I am absoutely in love with this cd, still, months later. There isn't a track on here that doesn't get you singing,humming, dancing, and grinning because each song is simply amazing. I hate to choose a favorite song, because I love everything Paramore does, from their own songs to covers. From their debut cd, I would have to choose....Here We Go Again and one of the most heartfelt songs on this cd, Franklin. These songs get me singing every time. I rate each song 10/10 and I would recommend that you would seriously get this cd!! Since this is their debut album, Paramore is amazing! And the fact that they are so young (they were between the ages of 13-14 when they began the band and that was about 5 years ago) and started so young makes them even more incredible. So what are you doing still reading this? Buy the cd already!! You won't regret it.
B000001ELL|5.0|So, for a KISS studio album, this is good.  It pretty well captures the KISS sound.

Rock out.

B000YAA68C|5.0|This movie was so well done!  The casting for each role was perfect.  Gerard Butler was charming (as usual!) and Hillary Swank totally believeble.  Just a well written, wonderfully performed story.  Worthy of any DVD library.  Also see Gerard Butler in Nim's Island!  Another great movie.  P.S. I Love You is a keeper.  You'll watch it many times.
B000056NX5|5.0|At least this is the complete version.  The CD had me worried with its omission of a few key songs.  As I stated in my review of the CD, this is probably the most emotive of any of the versions I own, the original Rock Opera, the original Soundtrack, and this.  I think the rock operas Jesus is the best, but now I'm just grasping at straws.  There are versions of each that I think out do the others.  This is very well done, very contemporary.  They accomplished everything they set out to.  This is very well worth the watch.

031606792X|3.0|Okay, so I have been following the Twilight Series from the beginning. I consider myself a \\"Twlighter\\" because I'm simply nuts about the series. I couldn't get ENOUGH of the first 3 books; they were beyond amazing. I opened up the fourth (and final) book of the series, expecting the same. However, I was disappointed.     ***WARNING***   SPOILER:    When Bella and Edward married, I thought, \\"Aww...how cute! This is going to be a good book\\". When they traveled to Esme Island, I thought, \\"Oh, how fun! Their own little island to honeymoon on!\\". It was all very sweet, and the sex part was pretty classy too. Nothing raunchy or tasteless. When Bella became pregnant, I thought, \\"Okay, a little odd, but it adds an interesting twist, so I'll take it!\\". But as the pregnancy progressed, it just got weirder and weirder! So let me get this straight: the baby was going to eat its way out of Bella?? After the baby was born, and Bella was turned into a vampire, I was excited to see how everything turned out. But, it was still a little bizare. I'm sorry to say that everything went downhill from there. It seemed to me like Stephenie Meyer had a lot of ideas that she wanted to add, and so decided to cram them all into one book. To be honest, it was a little overwhelming for me. And OH MY GOSH!?!? What was up with lovable, heartbroken Jake falling in love with BELLA'S BABY???? That, to me, is just flippin messed up. So, anyway, this book was a disappointment to me (though up until Jacob's part ended, it was good). I only give it 3 stars because I'm such a huge fan of the other 3. Sorry, Stephenie, but hopefully Midnight Sun will be better. :)
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I admit, I was slow to buy the newer Dylan CDs.  I'm more into Jakob and the Wallflowers than his Dad, now.  But, I heard just one song from this CD and started checking out the cuts--well, it's worth buying the whole thing.     Dylan's been backed by everyone, but this band is the best--even better than The Band or Grateful Dead, which I didn't think was possible.  I think the reason is these guys were assembled by Dylan for Dylan.    The songs are dark and long.  Dylan's voice is a throaty rasp, but he's a lot more understandable than his earlier work.    My favorites:    \\"Ain't Talkin\\" talking about a man who's gonna get gone.      \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" good old Southern style song with a gut punch.  This literally sounds like a classic folk song, rather than something new from Dylan's pen.     \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" lament about the condition of working today, including outsourcing.

B000002O3I|4.0|Howlin' Wolf is one of the seminal blues artists.  His guitar and that scritchy voice are definitive of the blues standard.  This CD is actually a two-fer, a Chess compilation of his two first albums: Howlin' Wolf and Moanin' at Midnight.    The packaging isn't much to be proud of. You get liner notes, but not much else and the paper's pretty disreputable.     Favorites:    \\"Back Door Man\\" you'll hear this one covered all over the place, but nobody does it like the Wolf.     \\"Evil\\" well, doesn't the name say it?    \\"Going Down Slow\\" this is an interesting perspective on the music business and money.     Rebecca Kyle, August 2008
B000H5TH1Q|1.0|This movie was absolutely B-R-U-T-A-L. I cannot believe that this came out a year after Scarface. Brian De Palma must have been burnt out or something. Maybe he fell asleep during the editing process and some studio exec hijacked this film, sprinkling it with gratuitous nudity and violence. Either way this movie is a sloppy mess. It has not aged well at all. Anybody involved in this must have to shield their eyes in embarrasement whenever it comes on television.        To begin with, the acting is absolutely atrocious. The lead actor, Craig Wasson, (now staring in Sasquatch Mountain) a dead ringer for Bill Maher of HBO, makes the wierdest choices. Mostly he just looks confused. Maybe its the script but you think he would show some type of emotion when he comes home to find his wife having random sex with some stranger. If it was me I'd probably be in jail for assault or worse. Instead he just silently closes the door and leaves, going immediately to a bar where he proceeds to fall off the wagon.        This kicks off the film and sets into motion his need for a place to stay. Within a few short scenes he has a new friend named Sam and a convenient new place to live, a bizarre home that looks like a UFO overlooking the Hollywood Hills. The gig comes with one condition, that he be home every evening to water the plants. WTF? It also gives him a view in a neighbors home, where a bombshell puts on a strip tease every night. Soon Bill Maher becomes a regular peeping tom, who wouldn't, but notices another man watching as well. This strange character can only be described as a cross between Freddy Kruger and Micky Rourke from Sin City. Bill knows that she might be in danger but can't tell her exactly how he knows this, since nobody likes to be thought of as a sexual pervert after all. When he finally does approach this woman, the encounter is beyond unbelievable. I'll spare you the details but it involves them nearly having sex in a tunnel after he becomes claustrophic chasing Freddy Kruger to recover her wallet. Again, WTF?       Mostly things just go downhill from there. At one point he steals her panties out of a garbage can. At another point he tracks down porn queen Melanie Griffith who proceeds to tell him that she'll do basically do anything for him but have sex with animals. Normally I hate to spoil a movie for anybody but I do need to offer a strong piece of advice. If you are squimish, avert your eyes when Micky Rourke/Freddy Kruger begins to drill the bombshell into the floor of her bedroom. All of this is witnessed by Bill Maher from the floor of her living room as he is being attacked by a rabid dog.        Anyway this might be the worst movie I have ever seen. I stongly advise you to skip it.
0140143505|5.0|I just loved this book! It is a very quick read and so enjoyable from cover to cover. It's a poignant story with a tremendous amount of affection between the two correspondents, which is ultimately very touching. I was so sorry to get to the end. I wanted it to continue with more story evolving about the lives of the characters.
B000J233SK|5.0|I love how with every album Loreena McKennitt puts out, her album is the results of her travels all over the world. On her album THE BOOK OF SECRETS (which would be her last studio album for several years before AN ANCIENT MUSE), Loreena explores the history of the celts. When I listen to the cd, I feel like I am getting a history lesson in celtic history. I like that Loreena writes music that is never insulting or trite.Although the album version of \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" is a far cry from the radio version, it is nonetheless still a joy to listen to. The album version is longer and slower while the radio versoin is shorter and more upbeat. Me thinks radio wanted a version that would appeal to a broader audience. If that was the case it worked but unfortunately it made people expect that version to be found on THE BOOK OF SECRETS. My personal favorite track on the album is the haunting ballad \\"Dante's Prayer\\" which was inspired by a trip across Siberia during one winter on a train, and the book DANTE'S INFERNO. I lke how minimal the use of instruments are on this particular track, allowing Loreena's warm voice to be the center of attention. The rest of the album is just as wonderful. The richly detailed lyrics and the lush, haunting celtic melodies makse for a wonderful combination. THE BOOK OF SECRETS have really grown on me over the years and is now a steadfast favorite in my itunes library and stereo.
B000O1799U|5.0|Somewhere out there, Jennifer Holliday is shaking her head and sighing. Jennifer was nearly 25 years ahead of her time when she starred in the Broadway version of \\"Dreamgirls\\" as Effie. Today, she's seen the show come to film and make another Jennifer, Jennifer Hudson, a star. Timing is everything. Hudson was poised like no other entertainer, to pick up the strings and threads left by the amazing Aretha Franklin as a queen of the soul sound.<br /><br />Amazing that she is propelled into the role by a movie, and not by a record. \\"Dreamgirls\\" is loosely based on actual Motown events, on promoter/producer Berry Gordy (Curtis Taylor, played by Jamie Foxx),an amalgam of a black male singer that is a combination of James Brown-Marvin Gay (James \\"Thunder\\" Early, played by Eddie Murphy) and a trio of female singers sketched after the Supremes. Like the Supremes, the trio starts with three girls who have been singing together forever (Effie, played by Hudson, Deena, played by Beyonce, and Lorrell, played by Anika Noni Rose) and who finally break into the Motown scene as backup singers. Involved in the success of the group is Effie's brother, who writes their songs (C.C. White, played by Keith Robinson).<br /><br />The movie takes the players through love and hardship, from gaining respect to being a multi-platinum success, with the downside issues that come with fame. Characters betray each other, love each other, find redemption.<br /><br />The music is spectacular, so much that I purchased the soundtrack. The world talks about Hudson's incredible solo of \\"And I Am Telling You (I'm Not Going).\\" I equally enjoyed her solo takes on \\"I Am Changing\\" and \\"One Night Only\\". She's incomparable. The group performance (with Eddie Murphy as lead) of the anti-war anthem, \\"Patience\\", was a highlight for me. And there is a sweet, sweet moment at the memorial service for Thunder, when Loretta Devine (from the Broadway production and the TV show Boston Public) sings \\"I Miss You, Old Friend\\".<br /><br />The costumes are equally well done, and the screenplay works hard to make the production flow (although it doesn't succeed nearly as well as \\"Chicago\\" did). It takes Dreamgirls from the tough times of the black music circuit in the 60's, to actual footage of the race riots and Martin Luther King, to the glitz of Miami and the disco scene, and the ennui that was Hollywood in those days. There are some \\"down\\" spots, an example of which is Thunder's drug problem...the script has focused on his womanizing, and the addiction issue comes out of nowhere.<br /><br />Completely entertaining, musically outstanding, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is a great addition to your collection of DVD musicals.are equally well done, and the screenplay works hard to make the production flow (although it doesn't succeed nearly as well as \\"Chicago\\" did).

B0017MO10U|1.0|The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they've given in to intellectual laziness.  If \\"Continuum\\" is the new standard of what we (the fans) can expect to see in the future from this franchise, then they should just stop making these films now.  The plot to \\"Continuum\\" is silly, the narrative (the story and how it is told) is completely bland and devoid of life.  It was as though all these characters we have come to know, suddenly had their souls written out of the script.
B0019EXZY4|3.0|This movie was not what I was expecting.  I thought it would be a typical heist film with lots of tension, planning and some humor and action thrown in, like the Ocean's movies or \\"The Italian Job.\\"  Instead, it was slow.  VERY, very slow.<br /><br />The movie is \\"based\\" upon a true story.  Which usually means a kernel of truth, and the rest is Hollywood.  However, in this instance there wasn't enough truth, or enough Hollywood!  Jason Statham plays Terry Leather, a slightly shady owner of a car shop, and loving family man.  Saffron Burrows plays his former love interest Martine who talks him and a few of his chums into a bank robbery for safe deposit boxes.  But, they are rank amateurs and only get away with it out of sheer dumb luck.  This should have been a source of humor in the story, but the set-up and execution took so long, with no real activity, that I found myself thinking, \\"get on with it already!\\"  Terry is slightly suspicious of Martine's motives, but can't pass up this chance.  Unfortunately, half the film passes before they start tunneling to the bank, and there is no real planning during that time.  In fact, the trailer does an excellent job of giving you the plan for the entire heist, heck the entire movie including the few punchlines, in under 3 minutes!  The trailer makes the movie look action-packed.  Only, ALL the action from the film is in that trailer - literally.<br /><br />None of the main characters except Terry are developed at all; they remain two-dimensional to the end.  This made it difficult to care about whether they lived or died, or even what their names were.  Instead, the film spends a lot of time introducing the nefarious crook Michael X (wannabe be Malcolm) who is untouchable because he's got scandalous photos of a royal.  That happen to be stored in a safe deposit box.  Then we meet Vogle, porn king of London, who stores his ledger of pay offs in a safe deposit box.  And the madam Sonja who stores compromising pictures of officials in a safe deposit box.  Gee, I wonder what Martine is after?  These villains are way over-the-top and almost ridiculously portrayed, but the rare instances of violence in the film are brutal and vividly real - reminding viewers that this heist really did occur, and people really did get murdered because of it.  It did not mesh well.  Nor did the gratuitous nudity that was peppered throughout the film.  In a comedic action movie, that's fine.  But, it was out of place here.<br /><br />The movie did have some good points.  The cinematography, costumes and sets really captured the look and feel of the 70's.  The events of the true story, the greatest heist in British history, are very interesting (and would have made an awesome episode of Notorious, or other true crime tv show), and the last 20 minutes were excellent  as the crew tangles with crooks, MI-5, the police, and each other.  Everyone wants the photos, and everyone wants Terry and his crew dead.  The film closes with an epilogue of sorts - words appear on the black screen giving further fallout of the case.  This information was the best part of the film.<br /><br />Since the official files on this case are still classified, there wasn't enough \\"fact\\" to flesh out the plot to support a full-length film.  This could have been much better if Hollywood had taken more liberties to inject some excitement into it.  I prefer Jason Statham in action roles like \\"Transporter,\\" or \\"Crank,\\" where he's kicking butt and stealing the show.  He was wasted in this family man role and he had zero chemistry with Burrows.  Overall, I'm glad I saw it but I should have passed on buying the DVD.  I probably won't watch it again, especially since there are NO extras on the single disc edition.  You get the film, set-up, trailer, and previews.  That's it.  How disappointing for a movie based on a true story.deposit box.  Gee, I wonder what Martine is after?  These villains are way over-the-top and almost ridiculously portrayed, but the rare instances of violence in the film are brutal and vividly real - reminding viewers that this heist really did occur, and people really did get murdered because of it.   It did not mesh well.  Nor did the gratuitous nudity that was peppered throughout the film.  In a comedic action movie, that's fine.  But, it was out of place here.    The movie did have some good points.  The cinematography, costumes and sets really captured the look and feel of the 70's.  The events of the true story, the greatest heist in British history, are very interesting (and would have made an awesome episode of Notorious, or other true crime tv show), and the last 20 minutes were excellent  as the crew tangles with crooks, MI-5, the police, and each other.  Everyone wants the photos, and everyone wants Terry and his crew dead.  The film closes with an epilogue of sorts - words appear on the black screen giving further fallout of the case.  This information was the best part of the film.      Since the official files on this case are still classified, there wasn't enough \\"fact\\" to flesh out the plot to support a full-length film.  This could have been much better if Hollywood had taken more liberties to inject some excitement into it.  I prefer Jason Statham in action roles like \\"Transporter,\\" or \\"Crank,\\" where he's kicking butt and stealing the show.

031606792X|5.0|What a great series. Kudos to Ms. Meyer for creating such a cool, romantic saga.  For all the haters out there, there's plenty of non-fiction available.
0393039102|4.0|When I read this book 10 years ago, I couldn't understand what Lomax was talking about when he described how he was held down by Japanese soldiers, a cloth placed over his face, and water poured over him.      It's now very topical.      It's a very honest and informative personal story, as well
0930289234|4.0|Fascist: a reactionary or dictatorial person.<br /><br />Watchmen is well written, to make a gross understatement. It is a gritty, complete world that uses the fantastic so sparingly as to create a truly immersive story. The characters are seriously flawed, just like all of humanity, and make some very very bad choices, especially in the end.<br /><br />Using logic that dictates that the ends justify the means the characters choose who lives and who dies in order to \\"save the planet\\" from the ruin of war and intolerance. The protagonists in this story are kept secret, even until the end. You are allowed to make up your own mind about who is the most right or wrong. Nobody in this story is pure... except for the god-man. And he eventually decides the fate of the world.<br /><br />And here is where the writer, Alan Moore, shows his cards. By creating a character who \\"sees the big picture\\"; who \\"is above the pettiness of human beings\\" who can't make the tough decisions, Moore has set the stage for an inevitable conclusion: some people, alot of people, an enormous number, will have to die to save the rest of us. It doesn't matter who it is, just so long as it is a bunch of them. Them. Not us. Not me. Them.<br /><br />As storytelling goes, it is nearly without flaw. Watchmen is a seminal work in the vein of HP Lovecraft's very best. Many works will take the lead on this book for one simple reason: it is a fantasy lovefest for those who want self-righteous justice.<br /><br />But, if you're not looking at it that deeply, it is also a great escape into a sweeping mystery novel that ties up every loose string in the end.
031606792X|5.0|What are those reviewers thinking??  Have they no imagination??  The book was fabulous.  Stephenie knows exactly what she is thinking.  If you don't want a happy ending, then go read some Libba Bray.  Breaking Dawn was perfect.  The wedding and honeymoon were sweet, and toned perfectly.    Don't listen to 'em Stephenie!!!  Or any one else who's a fan!
B00005QEO1|5.0|This album was not Aerosmith's \\"comeback\\" album, it was their crowning jewel, where they showed their musicianship, energy, and determination.    Nearly every track spawned an awesome single and I spent many teenage nights rocking out to the entire album.    This was Aerosmith's best.  Ever.
0151013837|5.0|Yan Martell's destined-to-be-a-classic Life of Pi is a wonderful read by itself. But coupled with the excellent illustrations in this volume, the story is enhanced by images from the perspective of the protagonist. If you've already read the book and liked it, get *this* version for your personal library. If you haven't read it and want to do so someday, then don't wait and get this version now.

B000IJ79WU|2.0|The version of the second movie was NOT worth it.  Sure there were extra scenes with Jor-El, but there was definitive errors in editing.  For example, in the end, Superman leaves Lex Luthor in the Fortress of solitude.  WTF?!?!?!?  Plus, at the end, Superman reverses time like in the first film, but then goes into the diner where he got is butt kicked to fight that guy Rocky; since he turned back time, it actually never happened.  Plus, there were plenty of deleted scenes altogether.    Don't waste your money!!!! Stick with S1 and S3 (with Pryor).
1576754227|5.0|This book is not in-depth and does not waste time on figuring out all the psychological reasons why people don't get done what they want to get done...and that's what's so great about it!

If you want some quick tips and simple methods to help manage your time then this is the right book for you!
031606792X|1.0|What absolute garbage this last book was. The first three weren't exactly what I'd call good literature, or really even literature. The 4th book just really took the cake, though. It was like reading bad fanfiction written by a Twilight-obsessed 12 year old. The heat/tension between Bella and Edward kept me reading the series, though. But I couldn't make it to the end of this one.    I have always loathed Bella as the protagonist. With her complete lack of independence, independent thought, interests, ideas of her own, etc., well, she's an awful role model for the thousands of teens that have read this series. Still, I always came back for Edward. Where was he in the 4th book? For that matter, where was the plot? There were so many plot holes I actually found myself laughing out loud.     An 18 year old impregnated by a vampire who--since he is DEAD--doesn't actually have the sperm? A sudden desire to bear children (I'm sorry but after despising the idea of being a mother your entire life and then waving it all away by saying \\"and her heart suddenly grew double in size and she wasn't scared at all\\" doesn't cut it!)? A mutant baby that just so happens to pop out (er, eat its way out) in a month? And then just so happens to grow so rapidly that Bella never actually has to learn about motherhood? None of the \\"new vampire\\" cravings/urges? Magical self-control and superpowers? Jacob still in her life (for a completely disgusting and warped reason)? Immortality but still get to keep your mortal family? Well isn't that all convenient. Yes, I realize this is science fiction, but it still has to have some rules and realism. Meyer was the one who created the rules in the first place (i.e. vampires can't create offspring) and then she broke them.     I didn't have much hope for this book in the first place. The only thing Meyers is good at (some of the time) is writing about sexual tension and copying ideas from other science fiction movies and books.
B000063DIH|5.0|While I believe that \\"Somewhere in Time\\" was Maiden's best work, this album was full of great tunes.     In standard fashion, Maiden had the harmonized lead guitars, the awesome voicework, and non-stop energy driving this album.    While the next album with the pretender vocalist really sucked, this album was top notch and gave metal fans like me something good to listen to, as opposed to the grunge crap dominating the airwaves.
B000000H42|5.0|This is not \\"just\\" a jaw-droppingly excellent album songwriting and production-wise, but is a continually intriguing listen for musicians as well. In fact, this album could be favorably compared to such classics as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sad Wings of Destiny in terms of musicianship and music composition.<br /><br />There are several tricks and twists involving time signatures and anti-sonata form that rank this with the most imaginative Rock/Metal albums in history. The verse-chorus-verse-break-chorus/I-IV-V cliches of most metal are often abandoned on this cd. Instead we get involved and involving song structures, the antithesis of the sleep-inducing non-excitement of bands like Dream Theater.<br /><br />King Diamond's vocals are definitely an acquired taste, and his lyrics can be comic-booky at times. But there's no denying the drama of this release.<br /><br />The guitar playing is shared by two, and often it's the manifold lead guitar solos that make this mandatory. There's plenty of Michael Schenker love on this album, but that certainly isn't a bad thing.<br /><br />Mercyful Fate's first album, Melissa, isn't much below this one in quality either, so be sure to grab that one too.
0061245097|5.0|A realistic setting, fast action, believable romance, cool vampires, fascinating characters, a grand plot and lots of gore.  A thriller, mixed with a vampire novel mixed with an adult love story.  The background information on the characters is so perfectly slipped into the flow of the story that there was no slow down of the action.  It was never bland, boring and there was never a clich&eacute;.  That I noticed.  A book so great that I would compare it to the works of Anne Rice and Kim Harrison.  Even a sexy cover.<br />It was so good it took me a few days after finishing it to realize that it was Book 2 in the series.  It was THAT good.  I've already grabbed the first book and can't wait to read it.<br />If you plan to buy one vampire novel anytime in the next year, this should be it.  Get it.  Used, new, from the library, whatever.  Just GET it.
0307387178|4.0|Jon Krakauer's `Into the Wild' is a very interesting look into the late life of a college graduate who gives away all his possessions and becomes a vagabond: Only to meet his demise in an abandoned school bus in the wilderness outside Fairbanks, Alaska.<br /><br />The trip between graduation and death is a bizarre study of Christopher McCandless (aka Alexander Supertramp) and his 2 year journey across south-western and mid-west America, ending-up in Alaska.<br /><br />The book is a strong testament of a young man with an upper-class upbringing who becomes seduced by wilderness and adventure, only to ultimately become its prisoner. Krakauer's book is primarily testimonials of people who knew Chris and their experiences with him. Most were fleeting, few lasting for more than several weeks. McCandless' journey without any destination took him many places and cultures within the US. Yet his intent was to learn - then flee. An escape artist, his final destination to Alaska is testament that even the bright and educated can learn plenty from sheer experience. McCandless almost obsessive introversion and despondency of his father sets the stage for a disastrous ending.<br /><br />Anyone who has camped outdoors for any length of time will be amazed this man made it that far: Until finally, when the luck that protected McCandless' runs out. His meager writings found in the bus, initially show more cockiness than respect for nature. Later, when his body begins relying on itself for survival, McCandless becomes scared and aware of his imminent end. Only then does the educated idealist come to terms with the power of nature and the serious lack of planning on his behalf.<br /><br />Sadly, this is another testament to why no one goes into a forest without the necessities: A map, compass, shelter and food.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. If there is anything one can learn from this book is what NOT to do outdoors, then this is it. The writing style of Krakauer is fluid and easy to ready. The character study of McCandless is much more abstract. I do appreciate the writer's attempts to rationalize the mentality and actions behind McCandless. Yet the writer, himself a seasoned outdoorsman, can't help but detail the futility of this misadventure. The writer's own outdoor experiences help paint a better picture of the enviroment McCandless experienced in his travels. I commend him on tackling such a complex character.f McCandless is much more abstract. I do appreciate the writer's attempts to rationalize the mentality and actions behind McCandless.

031606792X|3.0|Like many fans of the Twilight series, I was looking forward to what I believed would be a heart-wrenching yet satisfying ending to the saga.<br /><br />To begin:<br /><br />I read Breaking Dawn twice before posting this review -- the first time was immediately after I bought the book, and I went through it over the course of one day.  I re-read the book, this time much more slowly, to really get a good idea of which bits I liked and disliked.<br /><br />Fanatical reviews (negative or positive) aside, my one-line conclusion about Breaking Dawn is this:  It's okay, but not exceptional.<br /><br />Many readers including myself were disappointed not only by the plot line of Breaking Dawn, but by what felt like a lack of character development.  Part of that is our own fault, with our impossibly high expectations, but to be fair, Stephenie Meyers herself has admitted that she wanted this last book to tie all the loose ends and be a happy story in every way.<br /><br />Regarding my disappointment:<br /><br />I wanted a happy ending, of course.  And it happened -- except that it went on a route that wasn't among the countless possibilities I had conjured up in my head.  The characters felt flat.  Everyone is too perfect, and no one really has to sacrifice anything to gain something.  In terms of emotional growth, something I really expected would happen to Bella, nothing happened --- and the arrival of a new character didn't change that at all.<br /><br />Part of the allure of Twilight is that the people involved in the story are people we can empathize with.  No one is perfect, everyone has problems, even a \\"perfect\\" immortal.  That's what made the book so compelling and what caused us to care about the characters -- they were as human as you or I.  To use a popular quote: To err is human.<br /><br />In contrast, I cared about what plot twist would happen to the various characters in Breaking Dawn, but I didn't care about the characters themselves.<br /><br />There are other issues involved that people have mentioned as turning them off to the book -- the co-dependent relationship between Edward and Bella, the issue of marriage, pregnancy (and the avoidance of discussing the A-word in any seriousness), the complete disappearance of Edward's moral struggle regarding vampires and eternal damnation.  None of these were addressed.  I wasn't expecting all of them to be, but to have none?<br /><br />On the positive side of things:<br /><br />While there are some who view the book as a complete disaster, I did not.  It's good enough to be an absorbing read, and retained enough of the style of the first few books that it didn't feel like it had been written by someone else.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to someone who has only read the previous three?  Absolutely; it is after all the official ending to the story.  I also believe in supporting the authors who have written books you like (regardless of whether or not you dislike other books they have penned).<br /><br />Nonetheless, when I re-read the entire saga again, I'll probably skip Breaking Dawn entirely and make up my own ending.the book -- the co-dependent relationship between Edward and Bella, the issue of marriage, pregnancy (and the avoidance of discussing the A-word in any seriousness), the complete disappearance of Edward's moral struggle regarding vampires and eternal damnation.

0312937385|3.0|It has been thousands of years since Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggen fought against the alien buggers when he was just a young boy in battle school.  Initiallly thought of as a hero, he is now remembered as a horrible person that wiped out an entire species.  Humans populate a hundred worlds but still do not know of any other species with which they inhabit the world - except for on one colony, Luisitania.  In this world, there is a species of creature known to humans as the piggies.  Scientists on Luisitania are studying the piggies and interacting with them, but under strict law not to impart any human knowledge to them lest it interfere with the natural evolution of their culture.    Tragedy befalls Luisitania when the piggies kill the lead scientist.  One of his apprentices makes a call for a Speaker for the Dead.  The Speakers have the authority to travel to a world where a human has died and speak the deceased's life so that all may know the truth of their life.  The Speaker that answers this call?  None other than Ender himself.  He, along with his sister Valentine, has spent his adult life traveling from world to world at light speed so that although the worlds have aged thousands of years, he is only in his thirties.  He realizes that it is time for him to find a place to settle down and live out the rest of his existance and this particular world seems to call to him more so than any other has previously.  What Ender may not realize is that the interaction between the humans and the piggies is remarkably similar to previous interactions with the buggers and humankind is not ready to coexist with an alien species.  Ender must use his amazing abilities of persuasion to try to save both humans and alien lifeforms.    Ender's Game was one of the best books I have ever read.  I looked forward to this one with eager anticipation.  It was somewhat disappointing.  The story moved very slowly and did not have any of the action or drama of the first in the series.  This installment was much more moral and philosophical.  While still interesting, it was a very different type of book as a result.  I appreciate the book more now that I have finished it and can contemplate the theories that were put forth, but during the reading of the book I longed for the action packed adventure of the first one.  Read this one for the human emotional and moral dilemmas posed and not for war games and blistering paced adventure.

B000V63BX6|3.0|You never know, Alicia Keys is intentionally flat on her new album, so maybe it was intentional, but the opening guitar was painfully out of key, and always seems like it's not quite in sync with the rest of the sound.

031606792X|5.0|Hi. My name is Alex, Ivan's daughter, and I'm going to tell you my opinion about the fourth book in the Twilight saga, Breaking Dawn. I personally think that it is the best of the four. I've heard a review from another user that said if you haven't destroyed your copy, to return it and get your money back. I strongly disagree. Stephanie Meyer's previous books in the series have shown readers the Bella/Edward side of the story, in Breaking Dawn, Stephanie shows readers more. By explaining some of the happenings in this book though Jacob's point of view, makes this book the best. Now, I know that this book is the longest of the entire series totaling at 754 pages and you may not have the time to read it, but once you start you can't put it down. Breaking Dawn is full of edge-of-your-seat suspense and romance making it one of the most anticipated novels in the entire series. There aren't any negative messages being sent to readers through the book and this book really showed the power of making sacrafices and making choices that can have a bigger effect on people than you think. Breaking Dawn shows readers the sacrafices and changes all of the characters go through throughout the novel. It's full of surpirsing events, unexpected twists, and friendships you never saw coming or even thought would/could happen. This book deserves two thumbs up and a 100 star review. But remember that this is my opinion. I'm just a fourteen year old Twilighter that fell in love with and finished the entire series in no more than a month. To see for yourself you'll have to read it. I promise that it is something you won't regret.
B00156ZWV0|4.0|This splendid set, an amazing bargain, provides most of Vaughan Williams's music in various, sometimes relatively recent, vintages of recordings. VW is a vastly underrated composer. Some of the symphonies are bonafide masterpieces, especially numbers 4 and 6, but the London Symphony (#2) and the 8th and 9th are pretty top drawer as well, if not as stunning as 4 and 6. But then, 3 and 5 are excellent in a more \\"pastoral\\" way, though hardly the \\"cow music\\" written about in a recent New York Times article. If VW has written any \\"cow music\\" my ears have never detected it.  The First Symphony, however, a choral work based on text by Walt Whitman, is as uncowlike as you can get but too hysterically pitched for my taste (like Mahler's Eighth).     The sublime Tallis Fantasy is given an expert performance, the marvelous Oboe Concerto is well done. The two string quartets are little known but very worth listening to.    In all, at less than $2 per disk, it's hard to see why anyone would turn it down. The set's only serious defect is the pathetically inadequate documentation. One can hardly figure out who's performing what. The disks themselves lack track numbers, very inconvenient, and the booklet lacks notes. But the set is nicely boxed and at this price it seems churlish to quarrel.
B000002AVF|5.0|Unfortunately, shortly after this album, Carey began lowering herself to the standards of the popular music industry, and at that point, the focus was on sampling, beats and perfect sound.<br /><br />In this album, the diva is an artist. Her phrasing, her sensitivity in expressing each phrase is masterful. Why, oh why, can't she return to this level?

B000HD1AEA|1.0|Sarah McLachlan has a hauntingly beautiful voice.  It is a shame that most of her music sounds and feels just like most of the rest of her music.  There is little variance in the rhythym, harmony or subject matter.  I purchase the CD for the rendition of \\"Will You Remember Me?\\"  I was not disappointed.  It is one of the few tracks that has a unique and piercing quality.  But for the rest, I have never pushed \\"skip\\" so many times!  And what's with the language?  When did that become necessary?  It just feels cheap.
B0011Z3334|3.0|I'm a sucker for a band with female vocals, so it seemed like it would be a good buy. I really enjoyed a few of the songs on this album...for a month. Somehow, I found myself skipping their songs on my MP3 player rather frequently. Simply put, I just got sick of the album (and that rarely happens with me). I'd say, it's ehhh... ok.

031606792X|2.0|First off, I think the Twilight series ended with Twilight. I think it's a fantastic book, but these books have just been dragged out way too long!     Stephenie Meyer is a strong writer, but she has some flaws.    I know SHE understands everything she's writing, but she just lays everything out on the table and expects you to decipher it. There's too much information in the last 200 pages of the book! She just goes way too fast,and dumps hundreds of random vampire facts, and you're supposed to know everything that's happening with all the thousands of vampire clans and the Volturi.  A mortal teenage girl falls in love with a vampire, marries him, gets pregnant by him (in the first book Edward said it was impossible to impregnate a girl) becomes a vampire and everything is just perfect. She's filthy rich, she has no education, but that doesn't matter because she has Edward there to save her. She happened to have a family who was richer than God and could support her and her little family. They happened to build them a house. In all three books, they kept saying how hard being a newborn is. Oh! how convenient! Her power is that she can overcome being a newborn. hmm...    And the answer for all that Bella has done to Jacob is for him to fall in love with her half vampire daughter! Yeah, okay...    Also, there is SO much narration, sometimes you get lost in the wordiness. It took FIFTEEN PAGES for Bella to describe the \\"burning\\" sensation of becoming a vamp.I mean, come on Stephenie! Please be more succinct than that!     I know a lot of young girls who read these books, and this just is not a good message for them! Education isn't important, all that matters is that you have a rich husband and a baby growing in your belly.     One last thing, isn't \\"Renesmee\\" the stupidest name you've ever heard? Ugh. I'm sorry, that bugs be.     At least in the other books, things didn't just fall into place so easily. This book was just way too convenient for a vampire saga.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. I have watched this at least 5 times and never tire of it. The actors every one of them are superb and Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson light up the screen with thier undying love for each other while they both struggle with thier inner demons as such. Ruth is great as Jane in every sense of the word and Toby Stephens although too good looking plays Mr. Rochester in a way as to believe his inner tomrment only gone after Jane brings him back to life as such to the real meaning of love. The music was fantastic, the cast fantastic, the acting superb, the locations realistic and harsh and cold and eery, and the costumes, hair and makeup and mannerisms of this period--PERFECT. I have recommnended this to evryone I know and they have all loved it................My favorite!! Charlotte Brontes novel is brought to life in the way it was meant to be and was written.-----------

0441009425|4.0|When I decided to start reading science fiction this is what I started with. What a shock. You need to be able to keep track of several story lines happening in several different decades. After adjusting to this I found myself quite engaged in the story and very drawn into this universe.    However, I didn't feel like the universe's background had been adequately introduced. This left me confused since there is so much new jargon and references popping up everywhere. I have since finished the trilogy and the stand alone \\"Chasm City\\". It was the latter that really helped explain some things and I might recommend reading it first.

I used to watch this film over and over again, I wore out my VHS copy many years ago and can't wait for this to be released in the fall. I highly recommend this gorgeous fable, enjoy future and past generations!!
B000GRI18K|4.0|This is one of Cornwell's better efforts with her ME character Dr. Kay Scarpetta.  Here she faces a possible bioterroist threat from a person known to her only as 'deadoc' on the Internet.  Scarpetta is investigating a serial homicide in Virginia that may be connected to one in Dublin, Ireland. Meanwhile, an unctuous reporter has decided to leak information to the press, making Kay's life miserable and he intends to take down her niece, Lucy, next.  The plot moves along quickly and Scarpetta is a likable, intelligent, and formidable character.

B000MG1ZFQ|3.0|By this time the Doors were running out of material...atleast strong material that was on the first two albums....even the 3rd album \\"Waiting for the Sun\\"...had some strong cuts but this album was in some ways weak.  Jim clearly did not have much left in his notebooks of poems and this reflects on the album.  You just don't \\"feel\\" the music like on \\"Strange Days\\" but it is a good album none the less. I just wish they waited  2 years between albums and that way they could work on the material better.  I just miss Jim's haunting lyrics and imagery in them.  You get a tatas of it on the last cut but in between not much else atleast not too much else.<br /><br />Still the Doors were an incredible experience.<br />Peace
031606792X|4.0|I think the book overall was pretty good.<br />The ending of Bella Book 1 and the beginning of Jacob Book 2 was a bit too much for me - I was pretty angry with the book.<br />But as I got to the beginning of Bella Book 3 I was back into it.<br />I think it had a bit too much drama/stories all mixed in one - maybe SM could've just wrote a fifth book.<br />But overall - Not a bad book - perfect or not - she ended the series well.

0385340990|4.0|\\"Guernsey\\" is one of those books that grows on you as you dig deeper into it. Shaffer introduces her characters in a lighthearted, friendly way, and develops them rather evenly. One of the most endearing features of this novel is the way Shaffer brings her characters into the light... one here, two there, another one, then a few more. It makes for a far more readable tale than if all dozen or more characters were thrown at us right off. Shaffer does, however, leave me wondering why her villains, both in England and on Guernsey, are not more deeply developed. A novel like this is made richer by its villains, and hers are too transitory to really give this book the edge that it flirts with... hence 3-1/2 stars - OK, I can say 4. There is a rather graphic representation of life during wartime that may unsettle some readers, but it anchors the conclusion of the story. This is a book that I read in two sittings, and it is ultimately a \\"feel-good\\" story. \\"Guernsey\\" is by no means a compelling read, but it is a worthy book for a long weekend or a summer vacation. Like most things British, it is atmospheric, and Shaffer's descriptions of protagonist Juliet Ashton's daily activities, her encounters and her environs are quite able to transport me to where she is. Recommended.

B0017WI5VQ|5.0|She is the best singer by far in her genre. ADELE is amazingly talented and this album proves it. All her songs from beginning to end will leave you speechless. I love her raspy voice and her lyrics. You will never grow tired of this album, her voice or her lyrics. Her lyrics are catchy, and different from any others out there. My favorite songs are :Best For Last, Right As Rain, Tired, and Cold Shoulder, though I love them all. She is an excellent choice. Purchase this CD! You won't regret it, you will thank me! No No..Thank ADELE...she is wonderful, hear it yourself, it will change your life.
0783226845|1.0|I got this movie because I wanted to see the role in which Gabrielle Anwar is apparently famous for. Im probably the only one who would do that but I did, and maybe thats why it was a major let down. She was a pretty insignificant character to the movie and her scene lasted at most five minutes. The movie itself was for lack of a better description very 'movie like'. Al Pacino is a bitter old blind soldier who is trying to fulfill his last wishes and live it up in the big city before his planned suicide. Again this is just me but overall it was a dissapointment. I have yet to be impressed with Mr. Al Pacino.
B001AUEMFS|4.0|It is so hard to believe that Coldplay is still making really good songs this past decade, heart and soul. After the mammoth success of songs like Speed Of Sound, and the recent haunting and dark Violet Hill, Chris Martin and the boys still know what they are doing, and this latest single shows no signs of slowing down. Their latest single, the title track from their 4th album Viva La Vida, really brings in a nice mix of orchestral and pop worlds, which blend in pretty nicely with the song. I really like the feeling of this song through Chris and the boys, because it is simple, and doesn't feel like it is honestly as flimsy as who is hot right now like Miley Cyrus and The Jonas Brothers. While the song isn't as dominant as their earlier songs, it still shows that Coldplay is still on track. I hope their next single is as good, or even better than this.<br /><br />Song: B 1/2-

B00005JM02|5.0|Everyone has seen Disney's downward spiral and many badly written, stupid or generally crappy Disney movies, but Finding Nemo is probably one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. This is sweet, exciting, funny, touching, and everything a Disney movie should be.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|This movie is the sleeper favorite of 2008. It should have won the awards it was nominated for. Ellen Page is brilliant. Michael Cera is perfect. Jason Bateman is his usual wonderful to watch.  Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted. The great story, quirky humor, and wonderful acting makes this a must watch.
B000002UA7|5.0|I got into Kate Bush by way of Peter Gabriel's music, and I found this 1986 compilation a pretty good introduction to her work. She's a little theatrical, a storyteller and her work features a subtle twist of innovative production, which adds to the unique atmosphere of the songs. Have to be in the right mood for Kate Bush, but it's interesting music, with subject matter going everywhere from a Bronte novel (Wuthering Heights), the aftermath of a nuclear bomb (Breathing), wives deceiving husbands in strange ways (Babooshka) and academics who wants status quickly (Sat in Your Lap).    It's a pretty decent spread of tracks. Here's what you get:    2 songs from \\"The Kick Inside\\" (1978, though \\"Wuthering Heights\\" here has a re-recorded vocal from 1986)  1 song from \\"Lionheart\\" (1979)  2 songs from \\"Never for Ever\\" (1980)  2 song from \\"The Dreaming\\" (1982)  3 songs from \\"Hounds of Love\\" (1985)    and    1 song (Experiment IV) that is exclusive to this album.    There isn't anything from \\"The Red Shoes\\" or \\"Aerial\\", as the compilation was made before they came out. The tracks aren't in chronological order on here, which would have been nice. Ah well...
B001AHM2C6|1.0|The music on this album is great, but the mastering of the CD itself is terrible. There's so much dynamic compression that many parts of it are unlistenable -- some are even painful. I haven't heard mastering this bad since the soundtracks for the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies (also by Hans Zimmer, interestingly).    If you're going to make MP3s from this album and listen to them with a pair of cheap earbuds, you might not notice the problem. But with a decent set of headphones or a real stereo system you'll hear some harsh digital distortion in the loud parts of the tracks.    Audiophiles, don't buy this album. Complain to Warner Sunset/Warner Bros. instead.    For more information, do a Google search for \\"loudness war.\\"
031606792X|4.0|Breaking dawn may have been a bit predictable, and some things were \\"convienient\\" but the story ended the way it should have. Eclipse ended with a sad mood, but Breaking dawn neatly ties up all the loose ends of the story.   If you really think you understand the characters, you will appreciate the way Stephanie Meyer gave each his/her own happy ending.
B000001EHS|5.0|For any Def Leppard fan, this one can't be beat!  The cover doesn't look like much, but the songs are all awesome!
031606792X|1.0|Breaking dawn made me cry. And not that good-ohmigod-i-love-that kind of crying, but the this-is-so-horrible-it's-burning-my-eyes kind. Yeah, Stephenie Meyer blew this one big time- if it was, in fact, Stephenie Meyer who came up with it. Because I've got a hard time believing that someone who could write the most amazing first three books could also come up with this crap. Because that's what it is. Crap.    The first hundred pages or so were good- we saw Bella, we saw Edward, we saw the honeymoon. We saw the characters we all know and love. And then- BOOM. Wow. Ohmigod. Bella's pregnant. Which is the beginning of the end for breaking dawn. I mean, come on, didn't SM saw like, billions of times that all bodily fluids were replaced with VENOM? Yeah, she did. So she broke her own rules, okay, I can live with that.    The next moment that makes you want to hurl your book across the book across the room- Jake imprints on Nessie (and seriously, what kind of name is Renesee anyway?) Okay, wait, hold on. Ew. Werewolf imprints on vampire-human hybrid. Now, that's way too far-fetched, even for me. Yeah, that'll make a great conversation later in life- \\"Yeah, so, I totally made out with your mother like, ten years ago. Wanna try?\\" Not to mention, Nessie is like, totally fricken perfect and can't do anything wrong. Jeez, everybody fall in love with her in the first two seconds.    Despite the totally insanely horrible plot, SM takes away something else that makes us fall deeply in love with her books. The feelings, the emotions, the thoughtful, clumsy, insecure Bella. And replaces her with this scary vampire chick who cares about her ugly half-breed daughter, blood, and sometimes-maybe-only-a-thought Edward. Our sweet Bella is gone. Disappeared. Finished. Which pretty much means that the only aspect that made the first three books unbelievable, was the thoughts of this eighteen year old girl that we could all relate to, and now, we don't even have that. So now it's a horror book, with barely any romance, not too much humor, way too superficial, and a Bella Swan look-a-like. Fun.    So, the final judgement?    Breaking dawn sucks. Burn it.

0385486804|3.0|Like a few other reviewers, I felt this was a padded short story. I was looking forward to being done with it. I suppose 3 stars rather than 2 is appropriate, because I've given long thought to this. It's hard to decide whether I'm reviewing the book, or the choices that Chris McCandless made.     His choices I could relate to, as I was young myself once, and thought \\"there is more to life\\" if I just travel and experience. But, as for Krakauer painting a picture of a special guy: bright, kind, brilliant, understandably dealing with demons, and some analogies to underscore his point -- well, I only partly bought it.  Perhaps the survivalist is a guy-thing, because I prefer to work out problems without risking my life.     The question remained of his death: was he reckless and niave? Suicidal? Mentally ill? Perhaps this is the most intriguing part of the story. If it's true that he made an innocent mistake in choosing a plant to eat, then it is tragic that he almost survived but some relatively trivial choice was his downfall. But no one knows for sure. And he was happy and content, until the final couple of weeks. I'm glad for him, and glad for the peace of mind this must give his family. But, what he learned, he just barely passed on with highlighted texts and some scant notes in his journal.    So, the book, because of its woeful lack of a complete story, launches into speculation and a romantic Kerouac-like tale of a long line of frustration, due to lack of maps, planning, and money. So, then more speculation follows of analogies to other tramps in the wilderness: wise, crazy, suicidal, determined. What happened to them? Suicide, disappearance... Leaving behind distraught families. No one knows if they found what they were looking for. And what about the 2 chapters on mountain climbing? The author understands the need to push it to the limits because of this inner conflict and machismo; I could almost understand, but not relate. Sounded like a terrible ordeal.Therefore, the author tries really hard to explain why we should not just write this guy off as a wacko. In the end, I saw his point, but still thought it was a bad idea all around. It was difficult to get to the end of the book, and I was waiting for the big conclusion. So, \\"Chris read this book and highlighted this part\\". Big deal. I was not convinced that the experience was worth it. So, am I judging \\"Alex\\" or Krakauer? I guess that is why I'm still pondering. I've concluded that Alex is not someone I can relate to. And the author doesn't completely convince me that it was worth it. In the end, it was all about the food... yeah, surviving. Not the beauty of nature- not the lessons learned from nature. Just finding enough to eat. Tragic that it didn't yield a more profound conclusion.    By the way, I am a big fan of Eddie Vedder and his soundtrack to the movie! Incredible! And, I have the DVD at home, but haven't watched it yet. Maybe the movie will \\"reach\\" me better. We'll see.

0743290119|1.0|Three beautiful, successful women and one little problem.  None of them is married.  And they've all got a reason that has kept that glorious Harry Winston diamond from reaching their ring fingers.  Leigh is a successful book editor.  She and her boyfriend Russell have not married because of commitment issues.  In this case, she is the commitment phobic.  She likes her space and to have sole possession of her TV remote, doesn't want anyone -- including her gorgeous, successful and sweet boyfriend -- to invade either one.  When she gets the editing job that everyone is salivating after -- working on a successful and good -looking author's next novel -- she is forced to make some changes in her life.  If only Emmy had Leigh's good fortune.  She has just ended her third long-term relationship.  She is almost thirty, her younger sister is having a baby, and she's nowhere near finding Mr. Right.  How pathetic is she?  When she makes a pact with her friends to become more outgoing and have some much needed sexual escapades, she may find pleasure in single life, or will she?  Adriana is a drop-dead gorgeous Brazilian with an unlimited trust fund and endless trysts with hot guys.  But is she happy with her status quo?  She has no job, no sense of personal accomplishment, and while she's beautiful... well, good looks don't last forever.  So it may be time to give up her conquests and find a great and rich guy to marry.  Luck is smiling at her, for she's found a sexy director who is crazy about her.  Are things the way they seem though?<br /><br />I read The Devil Wears Prada.  I disliked the book, but loved the movie.  Chasing Harry Winston is very run of the mill for my taste.  I have read this kind of book again and again.  Weisberger brings nothing new and unique to the chick lit genre.  This is a book about three very one-dimensional New York women looking for some much-needed soul searching in the city.  It's Sex and the City meets Lipstick Jungle, only less interesting.  There is a lot of designer and celebrity name-dropping here, and the girls seem annoyingly perfect, especially Adriana, and for that reason I couldn't sympathize or relate to any of them.  Some more character depth would have been nice.  I like my slice of good ol' beach read as much as the next person, but this is beyond bad, and not in the good way.  I'd say skip this and go for Emily Giffin or Beth Harbison instead.  They bring something fresh to this otherwise overdone and clich&eacute; genre.  Perhaps the film version of this, if one is made in the future, will be better, as was the case with The Devil Wears Prada..

B000L212HC|4.0|NOTE: If you're wondering whether the Blu Ray purchase is a worthy one over the DVD, it is.  The picture quality is consistenly completely smooth with a wonderful sense of depth that really shines through.  The audio, meanwhile, is subdued but wonderfully so.  The uncompressed surround is terrific.  Now that the tech specs are out of the way, onto the bulk:    Ever since Christopher Nolan's little seen movie entitled Following, I knew we had a director worth keeping an eye on.  Following that up with Memento was perfection and then there was the oft overlooked Insomnia.  Then, he reinvented the Batman saga.  However, scrunched between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight was this little movie about magic, named The Prestige.  Actually, it wasn't really about magic.  It's about obsession, misdirection and mysterious plot twists...pretty much par for the course.    Nolan has crafted a fine story that runs like a trainwreck.  From the first death in the film, you know that things can't end happily.  At every corner, each magician tries to top the other, but neither is strong enough to know when to stop.  And what happens when someone has a trick that is utterly impossible to pull off?  How do you top it?  By doing the unimaginable.      And it's the unimaginable that will either make you love or loathe this film.    When I saw The Prestige in the theatres back in 2006, I left feeling a little bit cheated.  After a pitch perfect first two acts, in which Jackman's Angier and Bale's Borden continued to try and upstage/get back at each other, Christopher Nolan (and brother Jonathan) threw an utter curveball that seemd to not only stretch my belief in what I was watching but completely seemed out of place.  I thought about the movie for a long time and decided that I ultimately didn't like it.      The other day, it was playing on a movie channel and I managed to catch it just as the opening credits were running.  \\"I'll just watch a little bit of it,\\" I thought and ended up staying for the entire runtime.  I bring this up because what I find so thrilling and interesting about The Nolans is just how well-constructed (to a fault) their movies are.  The continual moving back and forth in time is nothing new to them (Following, Memento), but the way it's constructed, perfectly, as the three acts of a magic trick is pure...well, magic.      And watching through it a second time illuminated just how early they set up the events.  The twisting third act no longer seemed utterly incredulous (only just semi-incredulous).  The other not-so-out-there twist seemed incredily \\"duh!\\" but what was perfectly appropriate was simply how well a fairly obvious answer is hidden in plain sight and yet, not seen.    In the end, the final lines speak volumes:  \\"Now you're looking for the secret. But you wont find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be...fooled.\\"
031606792X|3.0|Meyer titles one of her later chapters in BD \\"Deadline\\" and then, in the final chapter, she uses the word again, writing about how one of her characters is so relieved that there is no deadline hovering over ___ any longer.  I don't know where I read it but I remember Meyer speaking about how she would never try to get two books done for release in one year again.  Juxtapose that comment with that repeated word \\"deadline\\" and I just wonder if that's where my disappointment with the book lies:  even though it's long and it does certainly wrap up many loose ends (and in ways to which I'm fairly open), the whole book feels rushed to me.  It feels uneven and unsastifying to me.  I revisited _Twilight_ last night and noticed immediately the more leisurely pace of Meyer's description and exposition.  The paragraphs she spent introducing and then describing Bella's truck, while not long, were written with care and detail.  Throughout the first three books, the truck almost becomes a character in and of itself, representative of Bella, her persistent and stubborn nature, as well as her clunkiness.  In _Breaking Dawn_, the truck is mentioned and eliminated in one or two sentences, wrapped up and set aside, as so many important issues seem to be concluded and dismissed in this novel (I'm thinking of Jacob's visit to Charlie, for one).  Having finished a dissertation not long ago, and having rushed to finish it, I know what that feels like and there's just something about BD that makes me wonder if Meyer, within the confines of a publishing contract, flew to meet a deadline (and is now really relieved to be past it, no matter what the final outcome--an outcome which is not terrible, by any means, but which is somehow not what it could have been, when compared to her first three books. . .) and instead of writing the three novels BD could have been, she had to get everything into this final one. . .

B0010V4TZU|5.0|More than half over, 2008 trends toward one of the better years in recent new music history. The last time we saw this much quality innovation and variation was the punk era, when the artists of interest hadn't even yet learned how to play their instruments properly. What they had going for them was attitude. American artistic education has certainly matured, evidenced by the excellent musicianship demonstrated by artists like Vampire Weekend. This disc ranks among the highlights.<br /><br />The songs are fun, the music is crisp and the beats are lively. A-Punk rocks. The M79 is obviously a NYC Metro line for you rural folk. Don't know what a Kwassa Kwassa is but I thought I was on an island when I heard it. The CD is a blast and is a great addition to a best 0f '08 list.  I rank the disc most accurately at 4.33 out of 5.00 stars, rounded down to 4.0. Nicely fresh, original and upbeat.
031606792X|5.0|Would everyone upset just stop and take a breath!?  IT IS A STORY not real life.  She is not telling girls to go get pregnant, or skip college, or run away from their families.  If that is what girls are getting from the book, maybe someone should be more concerned about their home life.  It was a great way to end the series.  I'm so happy the whole thing with Jake was answered because Bella was driving me nuts in book 3!  This book was drama, suspense, danger, and love of all forms.  If you wanted the book to end with Edward realizing he was actually in love with YOU, then yes, I could see how this would be upsetting.  But if you have any respect for writing, you'd appreciate the twist and turns of the plot and enjoy the book for what it is....AN EXCITING STORY.
B0012GMV58|5.0|Welcome to perhaps the most underrated Santana album in his discography.    Why this album hasn't received the same kind of attention that the previous albums did is beyond me.  Sure, Santana was probably feeling jazzy and wanted to spice up his music a bit.  Add a little variety to his classic sound.  That's what Welcome is all about- variety, and solid songwriting.  But we already knew Santana would provide the consistently wonderful songwriting, since he's been doing it on every album since the 60's.      Now, with the mid 70's approaching, what would Santana whip up for us?  How about a really good album.  If you like the idea of jazzy elements mixed with Santana's latin style, you'll love this.  I'm about ready to call it the lost masterpiece.  It's almost impossible to believe people aren't looking at Welcome as Santana's most underrated record.    \\"Going Home\\" scares me.  A LOT.  It sounds like something you'd hear after something went wrong in the middle of an ocean, and the survivors are coming home, breathing a sigh of relief that they survived, but feeling sick to their stomach because they can't shake the horrible memories of what went wrong while out there, lost at sea.  A quiet jam song that just continues to impress me every time I hear it.      \\"When I Look In To Your Eyes\\" has a mood that changes dramatically, and now we're back home watching Marsha Brady push shopping carts around (at least, that's what the flute solo reminds me of).  I love the vocals though.    \\"Yours Is the Light\\" has some highly unusual and downright creepy female vocals (did I just say \\"highly\\" and \\"downright\\" in the same sentence?  Does that make sense?).  Anyway, the female singer here has a high pitched voice that immediately reminds me of a very cold climate, such as the north pole where Santa lives.      \\"Mother Africa\\" has a GREAT rhythm section, and a short, but very interesting jazzy jam in the middle.  How a song like this flew under the radar, we'll never know.  I really like how Santana captures the spirit of Africa.  You can really feel it.  Neat-o!    The title song at the end is just 6 minutes of alright guitar playing, and some weird, wavey piano fills, that give off a feeling of a ship returning home from... well, that horrible and bizarre incident that got a hold of Santana on \\"Going Home\\".    \\"Flame Sky\\" rules.  The rhythm section can't touch anything Santana and John McLaughlin did on Love, Devotion and Surrender (the previous album) but the guitar soloing that builds and progresses into all sorts of imaginative things is rather interesting, and these two guitarists together is amazingly great.      Oh, and if the song isn't really called \\"Flame Sky\\" you have to understand, I'm too lazy to go check what the actual title of the song is called.  I can't hit the back button either, thanks to slow dial-up speed.  I don't feel like making it a day long camping trip writing up a review.  We ain't got all day, baby!    I love Welcome.  Please buy it if you're a Santana fan.  Oh, and you're welcome!

B0016NF06O|5.0|I've been a fan of Willie Nelson since I was a teen ... way back in the 70s ... and more recently, perhaps over the past decade, of Wynton Marsalis... Willie has certainly become more sophisticated over the years, easily building on his unique vocals and style in his own genre, and expanding a very well developed blues delivery. I knew Wynton as a classical musician - and have the Baroque CD he did with opera singer Kathleen Battle. What I didn't know was that he is equally gifted in jazz and blues. Highly recommend this CD ...

0517543052|5.0|In the 70s I remember sitting on my living room floor sharing with my roommates the very colorful Remember, Be Here Now. We were all reading it together. I was puzzled and so were they. We had no context to understand the simplicity of the spirit of the book. It was only as I experienced life and got older that I understood the joy of being in the moment -- of being conscious of real communication and compassion. I would like to think that that was the beginning of my personal path toward becoming a more aware human being and a family therapist.  Although the book is from a very different era the messages and philosophies that Ram Dass brought to western society - after his long studies in India - are now so widely accepted and prevalent that they are now even quoted on Oprah!<br /><br />Recently I had the privilege and pleasure to travel to Haiwaii and meet Ram Dass in person and it made me realize that this book is perhaps more relevant today than it when it was written (or maybe that's just wisdom through age!).
B00005JPS8|5.0|Since X-MEN hit the big screen in 2000 the comic book film had taken a huge leap forward. With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly. Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider-Man) the dreadful(Hulk), the Unknown (Sin City), and the renewed. (Batman Begins)<br /><br />Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen. It all begins with the legendary Marvel character Iron Man. This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart. With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero. Now he has created a powerful exo-skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good. All that with just a little time to show off is not too shabby.<br /><br />This movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre. It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable. An excellent origin story by director John Farravau. A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast. It's fast, dramatic, humerous and flat out fun. Still, this is only the begining of a much bigger picture in the Marvel film universe. But, you won't know that until the very end.
031606792X|5.0|Wow what a great book. I loved that Stephenie went a totally different direction than anyone would have imagined. I loved that there was never any conflict in either Stephenie or Bella's mind that Edward was her true love. I was impressed at how she managed to show the intense passion and difficult circumstances they had with their honeymoon, without being graphic. I am so happy that Jacob finally imprinted and how appropriate that it was Bella's child. There are lots of May/December romances who look back in amazement that their partner was just a in arms when they were of marrying age. It doesn't make them a letch. Just because Jacob recognized his future companion at a young age doesn't make him one either. He is protecting her and caring for her and waiting for her. How romantic is that? In response to those who have been critical of the \\"fairy tale ending\\", I am so glad she went that direction. In life and in most good stories, the good guys win in the end. Thank goodness!!! And no sacrifice? Are you kidding me? Bella was willing to sacrifice everything to give her child life and then in the end to protect her. Sometimes just being willing to make the sacrifice is all that is required. Bella and Edward were both prepared to give their lives to save their child. Most parents would be. I have also been surprised at the criticism that Jacob was able to accept Bella as a vampire so easily. Would you want Jacob to Bella, change his basic character? He learned to accept and still love someone who \\"tradition\\" had taught him to . As a parent, I know that I hope and pray that my children will be one degree better than I am; that they will be able to see beyond race, color, and cultural differences and learn to love others who are not like them. I believe it is what the hope for peace in the world depends on. Jacob, as the character we came to know and love, was able to do just that. I am proud of him. . I enjoyed this vampire story with the fairy tale ending. Did it take a different turn than I expected? Yes. Does that make it bad? No. It just makes it different. Stephenie is a great story teller and I LOVED IT!!! I feel bad for those giving a bad review because it wasn't what they thought it should be. To me that's one of the things that makes it great! It was unpredictable. Thanks Stephenie.
B000FBFMZ2|1.0|Based on other good reviews I saw here on Amazon, I made an impulse purchase of this book for my Kindle, since I like science fiction.    After reading about 5-6 pages, I realized I had made a mistake in purchasing it.      The characterization is buffoonish and weak and the writing is awkward as well.      Anways, if you have a Kindle, try to read the sample chapter instead of buying it outright.  You will likely save yourself some money.
031606792X|4.0|I went into reading 'Breaking Dawn' not really knowing what to expect. Though most of the plot has gotten many into quite a tizzy, once I let it settle in a bit, I found that I enjoyed the path that Meyer choose. The last two pages of the book presented a beautiful ending to this unearthly love story.<br /><br />I am eternally thankful to Meyer for sharing these characters and this world with me.

B001CD6FKS|1.0|I know The Happening was just as bad, but this was built up with so much hype, I hope people clearly see the Wachowski Bros. for the hacks they are.  Taking a beloved anime classic that's been around for over 40 years and ruining it with awful over the top acting, camp for the sake of camp, and a boring barebones story, the source material was thoroughly raped.  I liked the idea of creating an entirely artificial environment such as George Lucas has done with the Star Wars prequel trilogy, but the annoying elements far outweighed the cool factor.  The video game inspired racing sequences were fantastic, but as soon as some asinine character let loose with a torrent of ridiculous dialogue, any atmosphere that had been created was instantly flushed down the toilet.  I seriously hope the new wave of Americanized live action anime adaptations on the horizon; Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Dragon Ball and Robotech take a lesson from this travesty and stick to not only the source material but the spirit and atmosphere that makes each of them great.  We don't need Hollywood to ruin Japan's entire artistic culture.
B00000J7I3|5.0|Motley Crue have over the years become rock legends mainly because of their backstage debauchery and hedonistic lyrics that reflected the LA life style of the 1980's. While anthems like Dr. Feelgood, Girls Girls Girls, Wild Side, Looks That Kill, and Kickstart My Heart survive on classic rock radio and the very ideals of heavy rock before all this MC were a raw and gritty rock band that actually lived up their image and lyrics. While Feelgood is usually named as their ultimate musical statement and other tracks from Theatre Of Pain and GGG's get the spotlight this album is a true gem more than any other. Crue would glisten and glamour themselves up for MTV and the mainstream with those mentioned songs. While great rock anthems they were too polished and clean to be truely gritty and dirty which is what Crue were all about on TFFL. While the most famous on here is probably Live Wire, uptempo raw and brutal cuts like Come On And Dance, Merry Go Round, and Take Me To The Top are the best cuts the band ever did. On With The Show remains an album closer that will stay with you for a while. For metal/and or rock fans that are only familar with the radio hits of Crue, you'll be more than a little surprised at how genuine, honest and in your face these recordings are. While the follow up and Crue's \\"breakthrough\\" album Shout At The Devil followed the template this album layed down and did supply a little more of it's independent style this reviewer still feels Too Fast has an edge over Shout although both albums are more of an companion set. All these years later even thrash and speed metal fans who consider Crue useless hair band fluff might find something in this release. Which at the time lead many people to believe Crue were the next big metal phenomonon but by Theatre Of Pain they merely putterd out into glam/pop stardom much of the same way Kiss (who I believe Crue were taking cue from) did. So while the popular stuff may entertain for a while with tails of booze, women, and drugs, this album remains the glory moment for Tommy Lee, Mick Mars, Nikki Sixx, and Vince Neil where those nasty tail are fully convincing and delivered with style.
B000J0NIIW|3.0|this product isn't the greatest if u can get pass the imperfections its decent. first of all the battery life stinks! my other big complaint is that it flips over a lot and all the contents in the container spills. for the price its not bad but if you want efficiency get a shark.
B000001Y5D|4.0|I guess I'm really behind the times.  I just heard \\"What's Up?\\" on the radio for the first time this evening--and not on an oldies station, but a modern pop/rock one.  So, naturally, I thought it was a new song.  Imagine my surprise when I found out it was 16 years old!  In any case, the song definitely held my attention.  Linda Perry doesn't have what you'd call a melodious voice, but, at least with that song, there is something rather captivating about her vocals.  Given what I heard, and how good most of the reviews are, I may give the CD a listen.  (BTW, I wasn't able to leave the rating blank, so I gave it 4 stars based on the single.)

031606792X|5.0|This is my first time ever writing a review and it will probably be my last, but people are driving me nuts saying how awful this book was and how it doesn't send a good message out to kids. Really and truly PARENTS need to be the example to their children, not books, video games or movies or the television! Be a good role model to children, I don't think vampires and werewolves will ever be a good example to children... they either like to drink our blood or they are just look for fights. Hey kids its ok to be a blood sucker just don't be dependent on men and don't get pregnant at 18! GIVE ME A BREAK!   This book was great. It had twists no one ever dreamed of and I found them ironic and enjoyable. She did leave it open for another, I mean hey they do live FOREVER maybe we will get lucky and get another one!
B000LE0THO|2.0|While there are some tracks that sound better than the original Jet/CBS CD version of this album, most do not.  The somewhat exaggerated trebles and sizzle of the original recording (which I never found objectionable-and to my ear sounded \\"period\\" correct) have been deliberately toned down in this latest remaster, it has been at the expense of the vocals, which are now more subdued and distant-as if they were deliberately mixed into the background.  What's worst is there has been an attempt to pump up the admittedly weak bass of the original version, which has succeeded somewhat but unfortunately at the expense of the upper bass/low midrange- which is now bloated sounding and muddy. Overall, it's a darker sounding muddier mix. I can achieve a similar effect just by simply turning up the bass and turning down the treble on my amplifier using the original version.  I wouldn't consider this remastered version an improvement over the original CD version of the album.  It's just different. Bad different.  I'll keep it as part of my ELO collection, but I'll listen to the original Jet/CBS CD.
031606792X|3.0|For fans - the 1st 1/2 of the book was classic Meyer and I loved getting inside of Jacob's head.  I love his sarcasm, and his classic teenage boy mentality! I loved the 1st 1/2 as much as the rest of the series!  The book is worth it just for that.  Every fan knew this was the last book and that there was not going to be loose ends.  She had to tie it up and perhaps just wanted it over with.  At least that is how it felt.    Spoiler:  But just stop reading after that baby is born.  Its not fun anymore and I'm not even convinced that Stephanie wrote it!  I can't even bring myself to poke fun at all of the ridiculous changes like the nick names that suddenly pop up, or the endless undeveloped new characters, and the miraculous super powers they have.  If you were addicted like many of us were, you have to read it, and you will force yourself to finish, but lets keep in mind that its a young adult vampire series and not Shakespeare!  We all know that we're going to read the next book she writes no matter how bad this one turned out.[[ASIN:031606792X Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)]]

B0013FSL3E|1.0|Wall E starts out fine but in the second half a message that is dangerous and just wrong comes across.  The message is that fat people are lazy and stupid.  Every human character in this movie is grossly obese and lazy.  They stay in recliner chairs that hover and move around so they don't have to.  They are so lazy, they don't even eat their food, they drink it instead.  Then they are portrayed as dumber than dirt when their captain tells them they can grow pizza plants on earth.  They are so excited to grow pizza plants, they wobble and waddle out of their chairs to follow the captain.  It is sickening and untrue.  If Pixar or Disney showed a race of people the way they show fat people the movie would be banned.
039472903X|5.0|In my first year in marketing, chapter two of this book \\"how to produce advertising that sells\\" helped me immensely. I cannot say enough about this chapter. Ogilvy details his copy success, and a few of his failures, and provides invaluable insight into the mind of one of the greatest ad men of all time.<br /><br />Overall the book goes on to some more specific topics, like how to run an ad agency, which is also a good primer into what it is like in the boiler room environment that an agency career can be.<br /><br />This book is truly a classic, but chapter two has been invaluable to my thinking and learning about advertising.

B001CZJKS0|2.0|Fangoria Magazine did a review over a year ago about the boxes found containing lots of unused Halloween footage and bloopers. Apparently ALOT of it is in very good concdtion. Some fan created an online petition to plead that this footage be included in some way in the 30th Edition.  Anchor Bay have decided to ignore these pleas, and just release a box set with nothing new (except for a revised blue ray print). There will be no new documentaries, just the same stuff we have in other editions. What a hoax! And how stupid are they to include H4 and H5 just because they don't have the rights to H2 and H3?  There's no continuity in this box set.  A 30th Anniversary is a milestone and this film deserves to be treat better. Normally you can count on Anchor Bay to release worthwhile special editions but this is just dreadful.  Perhaps Anchor Bay just don't care and are hoping no-one will notice that their 30th release is nothing but already-avaiable material? Perhaps Anchor Bay couldn't get the rights to the lost footage found in the boxes? Perhaps some other company will release a DELUXE version soon thereafter? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
031606792X|2.0|Stephenie Meyer will never make anyone's list of great writers; her gift was storytelling, an ability that is often derided in favor of more high falutin' literary pleasures, but one that is an absolute must if the novel is to grant the reader any satisfaction. Twilight was a classic example of good storytelling, and New Moon wasn't bad, either. With each successive book in the -- I always have to stop myself from saying \\"trilogy\\" b/c that's what this was apparently intended to be and frankly, should have been -- series, however, the storytelling got less and less involving and the plot devices to clue us in on the lush world and rich characters that Meyer created became more and more tiresome... e.g., long tales of vampire and werewolf -- sorry, Jacob, \\"shape-shifter\\" -- legends explained to dear Bella, because she was always the ignorant one in any assemblage of the main characters. I wonder: did Meyer ever give us the backstory in the absence of one of Bella's queries?     With \\"Breaking Dawn\\", I was disturbed not by the imprinting (a strange concept but one that I merrily accepted, since the only other  interpretation of this unnatural attachment to a baby as a potential mate was obviously NOT Meyer's intention) or the neat \\"conclusion\\" to Bella and Edward's love story (I'll be looking for a story starring Nessie, Jacob, and the Brazilian half-breed in a few years). I was hoping that Meyer would somehow be able to thwart the Volturi (great name; it even sounds evilly vampiric)and find a way for Bella and Edward to live and love together without her becoming a vampire herself, the aging process of humans notwithstanding. Bella's choice, to willingly embrace a life of blood-drinking (so she kills animals instead; she still has to drink BLOOD to \\"live\\"!), and lose her SOUL in the process, was despicable! I don't care WHO the guy is, even my dearly adored husband, there's no way I would ever even consider joining the permanent nightlife just to be with him.     Theone thing she got right (sort of) was investing Bella with the kinds of gifts that we could actually see her bringing into her new \\"life\\", despite Bella's inability to do anything well except cook as a breathing being. On the other hand, I tsk-tsked the night away when I read the descriptions of Bella's awesome vampire power and got visions of Famke Janssen in X-Men.     I hated \\"The Host\\", Meyer's non-Twilight offering released earlier this year. Perhaps if she had spent less time on her first \\"adult\\" novel\\", Bella, Edward, Jacob, and the readers would have gotten what they deserved -- a better ending.
0446402389|5.0|CHILD 44 is one of the very best thrillers released this year.  Interwoven stories of Russian domestic spying, psychological analysis, and family and interpersonal relations play out across the country as a plodding true believer wakes up to the crimes going on around him.  He tries to make amends by solving a series of crimes that the authorities do not want solved because they will make the \\"system\\" look bad.  Tom Rob Smith is an amazingly good writer and must have had some terrific editors.  When you finish this book, you will, like the rest of us, await the next one.  We have a new talent in the field.
031606792X|4.0|As a fifteen year old girl, I impatiently awaited the release of this book like a lot of my friends, and read it in less than two days. I found myself a little disappointed. The ending ended too perfectly to provide me satisfaction, but this is a problem I've seen often in great book series. I think a less... well, happy ending would have been better.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />I was also surprised with the baby... I hadn't seen that one coming. Although it was written nicely, I think I might have preferred the book without the baby.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy this book as the end to a fabulous series.
031606792X|5.0|Ahhh series. So many wonderful things about them. But the worst part is..they must always come to an end.<br /><br />This is the very much anticapated conclusion to the Twilight series. I went out to the store the week this was released, and immediatly started reading it.<br /><br />The book starts off with Bellas wedding to Edward. A wondeful event, and then they are off on their honeymoon! Now, i won't say too much,since there are still folks who haven't read the book yet. But unexpected complications arise, and Edward and Bella find themselves in danger(again) and facing enemies. Jacob is back, as well as the pack and some new faces.<br /><br />I just want to say this. A series finale(whether book or tv show) will always feel somewhat anti climatic to some. The book is a tad predictable in places, and at times, Bellas attitude towards Jacob made me want to smack her, but it happens. That shows you care about a character.<br /><br />Overall, i enjoyed this book. I really hope that there are more books featuring Jacob and Nessie! would be interesting to see!<br /><br />Edit: i just finished rereadin this book. While i didn't take ny stars away, reader beware, it does not do well on rereading. What the heck was i thinking!?
B00005JPAO|5.0|This is the one of the best movies I've ever seen. While most viewers already know the story pretty well, the superb acting makes it all seem new. Helen Mirren has  Queen Elizabeth down to perfection. It's surreal how good she is in this part. The one negative for me is the portrayal of the \\"Queen Mother\\". This doesn't seem quite right from the public image she always presented.
B00067RH3A|3.0|This is Zappa, so it is all good. This is a compilation where the producers have basically taken the older (and better) 'best of' compilation 'Strictly Commercial' and deleted 1/3 of the tracks to make it a sweet 16 compilation.     This is all PG-13 Zappa, a good introduction, but there is no need for it since you can still find \\"Strictly Commercial\\".
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This is a real \\"thriller\\". The plot moves right along and the acting is excellent. We watch this movie frequently.
031606792X|5.0|...but I loved this book!  yeah it was twisted, but hey, we're talking about a world with vampires and werewolves, why on earth would anyone expect it to be normal?     Sure there were some squirmy moments in there.  However, I've always considered a relationship between a hundred+ year old man, and 17 year old girl to be kind of squirmy anyway.  And let's be honest, even in the last book she flirted on the edge of inter-species coupling.  I thought the offer to have pups was hilarious.     I am also a romance reader, so I DO love a happy ending, I admit it.  And this book delivered.  I don't think that an author ever owes me anything.  It's her story to craft as she chooses, it's my choice to support that author by purchasing her books or not.  In fact, as readers I think we lucked out because we got a whole heck of a lot of story in this one book.  Rotating villains, heroes and heroines that we want to smack from time to time (ie, they're NOT perfect), an evolving plot where the problems we face at the beginning are not the problems we face at the end and characters that grow through their experiences.  It's a good book.     If I can make any complaint about this book it's that I don't like the idea of the Volturi and I have never enjoyed reading about them.  So I found those scenes a bit tiresome.  However, I loved the dastardly Romanians and if there's a Book 5, I hope they play a greater role in it.     I also have to say as well that I truly appreciate how the title of the book echoes the mood each time.    Twilight, Bella discovers the world between night and day.  New Moon, Bella lives through the darkest of nights.  Eclipse, where Bella's moon and the sun try to outshine and overshadow each other.  Breaking Dawn, where Bella finds hope and light and joy in her new world.  Very clever.  Two thumbs up.

B000NIVJEU|1.0|The only reason, I would \\"consider\\" purchasing this movie, is to either (a) laugh my butt off at it, or (b) watch it while in a very, very, very bad mood so I could criticize it constantly to make myself feel better.   But in all honesty, they took a very good read for me and turned it into a Hollywood cash-reeling nightmare! (if you'd even call it that)   Worst ten bucks ever invested in Metropolitan Theaters... Man!    (below are my thoughts as the film progressed when I saw it in theaters)    Prelude Montage Thing: Okay, uhhh... good special effects, but aren't they kind of jumping the gun a little bit with the plot?    The Chase at the Very Beginning: Okay... this is beginning to seem a little weird now.  Score isn't fitting very nicely, it's a little overexposed and... all right.  Who the heck was the editor for this film?  Don't you think he or she would have just \\"a little\\" shred of \\"sense\\" to build up just a tiny amount of tension or rising action so we can actually feel obligated to \\"worry\\" about this character? *Arya does down five seconds following that statement*  Wow; Apparently not!     The Introduction of the Main Characters: I'm seriously contemplating on going home... The acting is making feel sick, but on the other hand, I did pay ten bucks to see this horrible flick, and if I leave now... I'll NEVER know how bad it really is... ... Right?    When Saphira Shot Up Like a Weed and Started Talking: All right...  All right!!  This ticket is official for the worst movie ever created.  And too bad, Ed Wood Jr.-- you finally have a director and a motion picture that can give you, and your cult-masterpiece \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" a total run for its money.  *snide laugh*      Trust me, though.  This movie is something you either want to wait for when it comes out on FOX television, HBO or Cinemax if you have that luxury, or perhaps just leech it off from a friend who may have already made the mistake of purchasing it.  For it isn't worth a dime to anyone... let alone you.   I know there are some who want to see these characters in real life and in action, but trust me:  The book is paramount when it comes to description and story-telling, but this is a pile of dog manure (and I trust you can trust the difference between the two).

0143038419|1.0|I very much wanted to love this book, but it just didn't happen for me. Perhaps it was all the hype that originally raised my expectations. I had a difficult time remaining interested in the book and I found that toward the end, I was skipping sections just to be done with it, which defeats the purpose of a good read. The writing was not captivating, it was merely average. Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style is very matter of fact, with tongue in cheek humor and joking style comments. It's a style effective for some stories, but I don't think it was effective for  a book about  a woman in search of happiness, love & balance; in essence, spiritual insights. I found her attempt at humor to be distracting. The book starts off good, as the author realizes her life is not working. But as we venture into her travels in Italy, the writing goes flat. I expected more robust and beautiful writing about a place as sensual and beautiful as Italy.  The chapters about India were better than those on Italy and Indonesia.  I appreciated the author's  honesty about her struggles with meditation & trust.  It's difficult to imagine that most women going through ugly, painful divorces (I have known several), suffering from depression and self-esteem issues would have had the liberty and means to run off on an all expenses paid, one year sabbatical spanning 3 countries. It was a difficult story line to relate to. The story line that I found very annoying was the fact that the author is so admittedly intoxicated by men, never having gone very long without having one. While she strived for independence, I never felt that she really got there, especially when you consider that by page 294 she was once again, \\"involved.\\"  I was touched by the story line in which the author demonstrated wonderful generosity to help her friend Wayan. Still, generosity doesn't equate to good writing. I'f I hadn't gotten bored with the story line I would have at least given it 3 stars, but rushing through the end of a book just to have it be over and done with is a 2 star book in my opinion. Overall, I did not feel that this was a beautifully written, spiritual quest for a woman seeking independence.of a book just to have it be over and done with is a 2 star book in my opinion.

031606792X|5.0|As a woman who went to college, had a successful career and taught at a university level before I got married and had children, I totally loved this book and series and would tell all the naysayers to lighten up!    True self enlightenment for women isn't based on \\"worldly\\" achievement, it is knowing who you really are and what the purpose of life is. Finding the love of my life and having children trumped any personal achievement I've ever had. Moreover, anyone can see that the timing in the story was the only one that would allow that to happen for Bella and Edward, and seemed a possiblity to me even before book four was written.    Further, I think it's clear, though BD may be the end of books about Bella and Edward, there is much more story to be told before the story concludes for the other characters--mainly the role of the Quillites in the conflict between the Vultori. I think there is much more to come...    Women shouldn't base their self-esteem on their academic/career achievements. If they do, someday they'll find themeselves looking out their corner-office windows and realize their lives really had little significance!

0142000663|4.0|I love this book for a variety of reasons, and I'll share these before offering my criticisms:<br /><br />1) Wonderful tale of a painful time and place in American history<br /><br />2) Great characters - and powerful bonding between them.  I loved their ability to sacrifice for each other - at great costs.<br /><br />3) A metaphorically redemptive message:  this book shows the strength of human perseverance in the face of awful odds<br /><br />4) Incredible local color - accents, speech, behavior!  John Steinbeck really knew his stuff, and brought it to LIFE!  Kudos!<br /><br />5) Beautiful writing - so many times Steinbeck wrote scenes that sing off the page, transcending the story, the characters, and himself<br /><br />6) I just love Steinbeck's character of Preacher Casy.  He adds such a strong dimension of honesty, emotional courage, and truth-seeking to the book...  He's one of my favorite characters in all of literature.<br /><br />My criticisms:<br /><br />1) Having previously read this book fifteen years ago, I learned then that the \\"filler\\" chapters - the ones NOT about the Joad family - were unnecessary to the story, so I skipped them this time around.  This made the book infinitely more readable and enjoyable.  I would guess these skippable chapters account for about a third of the book's volume...<br /><br />2) I found the ending cheesy - didn't like it fifteen years ago, and still don't.  I won't go into details (don't want to be a spoiler), but I found it too intellectual and emotionally disconnected to the pulse of the story...<br />3) Steinbeck uses various of his characters (particularly Preacher Casy) to make all sorts of philosophical comments on life, but never does he state the obvious, much less come near it with a ten-foot pole:  DON'T HAVE SO MANY KIDS!  The whole book is about people trying desperately to feed their children - for whom they cannot provide.  To me this leaves the parents - sharecroppers, who, at the best of times, had life REALLY hard - and not just society, responsible.  Even ONE little comment to this effect would have been welcomed.  Yet has anything changed since the 1930s?  Does anyone suggest that starving adults in Darfur not have children?  (Or the EMOTIONALLY starving adults right here in the rich USA???)this effect would have been welcomed.  Yet has anything changed since the 1930s?

B000000ZGO|4.0|My father used to tell me that his generation of musical heroes made real music. He would say , \\"One day you young folks will listen to real music again.\\" Dad was right. The era that birthed such greats as Isaac Hayes, Barry White, Hamilton Bohannon, and other innovators is long sought after today. One of the reasons we'll never forget them is because their originality is still sought after by today's artists. They borrow, sample, cover, and remix everything we grew up on. (Sure, they say they are paying honor to them by doing so, but we don't buy that crap!) \\"Hot Buttered Soul\\" ushered Mr. Hayes into a realm of mass acceptance with music audiences everywhere. How many of us still remember our parents playing the vinyl edidtion at cookouts and parties? That trademark bald head on the album cover still echoes loudly in my mind. Too young to get the full gist of the lyrics, I gathered he had poured his heart and soul into these songs. One thing was clear to me as a youngster, he sure made some of them long enough (lol). If you're new to the name and music of Isaac Hayes, consider this a perfect place to get to know him better. This album is a fine sample of the music and the genius behind Isaac Hayes. So to my father I say, \\"Yes sir. You were right yet again. We have found our way to real music...again!\\"<br /><br />DJ Come of Age
B000007MVX|3.0|While in high school, my friends and I waited with bated breath for the next Tull album. We'd been hooked at Stand Up, went gaga for Benefit, rejoiced with Aqualung, smiled at Living in the Past, and scraped our jaws off the floor with Thick as a Brick. Then, instead of a new album, we got rumors...Anderson hated the new stuff, it's to be scraped. They'll do a live album next because they're out of ideas...Ian is thinking of a *gasp* solo effort...etc.   So when Passion Play finally hits the stores, we're on it in a flash. We listen...look at each other...put on the other side...look at each other...and we laugh! What the heck are they thinking? What's with all these SAXAPHONES? What the heck is Ian trying to say with these lyrics? What is our favorite band doing?!?   We listen a few more times, discuss the ramifications of what this album will do to their popularity, disect a few passages, and come to the conclusion...     ...It's O.K. Just O.K. Because when the music cranks, it's unstoppable, but the lyrics are obtuse and confusing, then there's this \\"Hare\\" thing in the middle, and...it's just O.K.     ...30 some odd years later, my friends are memories living in other states, Tull is still soldiering along, and Passion Play is still just O.K. To me there are more enjoyable, accessable, and tighter albums. I would have liked to hear a whole album of the Chateau D'isaster tapes - get it on the Nightcap album - but even those lyrics were inscrutable. But if you are a Tull fan (I still am), get this album. If you are not, get one of their other classics.
1932100660|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  It took me a while to get the book...and a few months before I got to it.  Once I started reading it, I was on fire...and telling anyone who would listen.  Every human being should be able to read this book.  Dr. Campbell lays out the research in understandable terms...and it is shocking to read.  It proves to me that we must be in charge of our own health...and that means eating healthy...and vegetarian.  This information can truly save lives.
031606792X|5.0|I've been reading the reviews and discussions on this book and I think people are looking at the book to literally and trying to find things about it that didn't live up to their expectations exactly as they were hoping it would. I started this serious when Twilight originally came out and absolutely loved it. Imagine my surprise and excitement when a year and a half later I see that Stephanie Meyers has continued with the series. I tore through the remaining 2 books and waited anxiously for the release of BD. And I loved it. Through out the whole series I was telling everyone \\"Watch Jacob is going to imprint on a vampire or something crazy\\" so as soon as Bella realized she was pregnant I KNEW that he was going to imprint on her baby even though Stephenie tried throwing us off w/ the dreams about a little boy. For the people who are upset about this whole baby imprinting thing you have to realize that 'imprinting' doesn't   translate into 'sex'. Remeber Quil? It's about protecting them and making them as safe and happy as possible which EVENTUALLY turns into the same kind of love that Edward and Bella share once said baby is old enough in both mind AND body to be ready for that. Get your mind out of the gutter. For those who hate the fact that everyone gets everything they wanted... 1)It's the FINAL book. You got to tie up those end somehow and what better way to do it where everyone lives happily ever after  2)Sure SM went the 'easy' route but what's easy about having your best friend in love with your daughter? Having to keep your visits with your parent to a minimum and maybe after a certain time never seeing them again becuase you never change? Being immortal? Let's try and think a litle bit deeper here.   And Bella as a vampire. I loved her! She was in essence the 'same' Bella but of course EVERYTHING had changed. In some senses I wish that she had struggled a little bit more as a vampire but all in all I was happy that SM didn't save it to be the huge suspenseful ending of the book which she defintely could have done. And finally for those who are reading it as SM's message is that all you need is a man and you will be happy. You could turn it around for Edward to. Because wasn't it established in Twilight that he hadn't been truly living until he found Bella? So if all you need is a man and if all you need is a woman to be happy, then isn't it really all you need is love? Correct me if I'm wrong but poets, musicians, storytellers have been sending this message since time itself began. SM just did it in a different way. So stop hating and just appreciate that everyone found love. Including Charlie!
B000002MZ9|3.0|By the mid 90's Neil Young had been discovered by a whole new generation of younger fans earning him the moniker of \\"the godfather of grunge\\".  Thus it was only natural that he would record an album with a band who is arguably one of the best of the grunge movement, Pearl Jam.  \\"Mirror Ball\\" is a collaborative effort between Young and Pearl Jam that unfortunately comes off as rather average.  Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder is mostly absent (although does sing a bit of lead on \\"Peace And Love\\" and background vocals elsware) so this is mostly Young with the instrumentalists from the band.  Although Pearl Jam are probably better musicians than Neil's normal backing band Crazy Horse the chemistry is not quite there.  This is not a bad album, but it does seem rather rushed and not quite up to what I think a lot of people were expecting.  The material was put together and recorded rather quickly and I think it shows throughout this album.  There are a few gems to be found here, as \\"Song X\\", \\"I'm The Ocean\\", \\"Peace And Love\\" and \\"Scenery\\" are all very good.  The rest of the album is pretty average for Young and nothing that has ever blown me away.  I give it 3.5 stars.
031606792X|1.0|In BD I miss the love triangle that was sending Twilight fans into actual Teams. It vanished in BD, it wasn't properly ended in Eclipse(as so many people are now trying to say)if fans were forming Teams for Bella's choice. Many were hoping for a final decision with some form of loss, some tears from the readers and in the end a way to smile and be grateful with whatever the outcome might have been.     Instead we get an improbable baby and many MANY bad moral choices made by Bella that are glorified for the youth fans. Should a girl really change who she is for someone she loves? Should she give up her family and friends for him?     No, real women/girls shouldn't do this and neither should protagonists that young women look up to. Or anyone for that matter, men/boys included. You give up your life, you should pay a price. OR you don't give up that life and who you are. Bella could have picked Jacob and had the bouncing babies and picket fences. Or picked Edward and faced consequence. That's life, that's a good read.     Steph should never have mentioned chromosomes, even in fiction, anyone who's been to highschool knows you that the \\"mule\\"(the explaination Steph gives for why Ren is possible with the chromosomal differences) that was Ren now disproves the point she makes as to why Jake imprints on her in the first place! As a perfect sex match to reproduce with. Hmm... soo many things wrong with this:   \\"shapeshifters\\" wouldnt be able to reproduce with humans as they so clearly have in the past if they had a different number of chromies.   But I'll go along with it... different number.. So, wouldn't that make Ren a shaptshifter, too?   And If Jacob ONLY was attracked to and in love with Bella because of the genetic material that resided in the ONE egg of hers that would someday help form Ren, then wouldn't Jacob also be feeling that same intense love and pull toward Edward because of the \\"magically existing\\" seed in his rock hard sack? aka the sperm that held the other half of the genetic code of wouldbe Ren?     Breaking Dawn was a let down.     Try to imagine it... It's the night before the wedding... Bella's lying in bed FILLED with doubt because she does NOT want to get married. There's a tap at her window... It's Jacob. He's come to convince her not to get married to Edward.     Bella, not having seen Jacob in months, is overcome with joy and reminded of the love she feels for him. yada yada yada.... SOMETHING     OR     Bella has the wedding that she didn't even pick out the dress and flowers for. The marriage, that she didn't want, is official. The only thing left is her turning into a vampire--the one thing she actually did want. This should happen in a somewhat less dramatic and stomach turning way. AKA leave out the part where Edward is chewing that creature out of her. And please, does she had to torture Jacob anymore, by making him aide in the transformation and then getting no thanks or recognition until the end? By this point Bella should have given up her loving dad and wacky mom and relentless(and let's not forget lifesaving) bestfriend. Instead everything works out! unconvincingly so.     Steph, make her actually GIVE THEM UP. It's called a choice for a reason. Can't be both ways! Ugh...     So, sooooo many things frustrated me with his book but nothing more so than the loss of the true passion between Bella picking her love...Edward or Jacob. And maybe the inconsistency with the characters. And also maybe that ridiculous baby... Okay and the name too. And the h-S-appy ending.     And please, Bella's spine could not have broken in half during child labor, that would imply she had one which her lack of responsibility and decision making throughout the series clearly shows she does not. Ahem please don't hate for that :) I just wanted the Bella we all loved to grow up, come of age through strong and mature choices.
031606792X|1.0|I pretty much agree with the other one star reviews.  I couldn't get enough of the first three books, I read them in less than a week. And then re-read them over. I couldn't not wait for BD, August 2nd couldn't get here fast enough.....and then sadly, it did.  I was relieved the next day to see I wasn't the only one who felt cheated, who thought \\"who wrote this book?\\"  and just thought so much of it made no sense.  It was like the other three books, those characters and themes in those books are out the window.  Several times as I was reading I was thinking, seriously? Is this a twisted joke? THIS is what we waited for, are we sure this isn't some bad fanfiction? There was so much jammed uncomfortably into this book -- it could have been two or three more books.      First, I hate Nessie!  The whole idea was bizarre to me and the name, oh please!?!  I'm not even going into the imprint with Jacob thing.  Where was the romance? Edward became a doormat. Bella never wanted a child. She is now best friends with Rosalie and Alice is hardly around. Jasper is now Jazz, why after three other books are there suddenly nicknames?   All this hype about the \\"after car\\" and it is mentioned in passing, blink & you miss it. HUGE hype about how how difficult it is to be a newborn, then nothing, Bella breezes right through it. I wanted to see her really deal with it...NOPE. Hype about the scary Voultri, do we get a big showdown - NOPE.  All of it just anti-climatic. Lots of Leah and then she fades away. Bella becoming basically sex crazed. She does not have to give anything up for love or make choices. There were times in the other books where my heart broke with the choices and feelings. This book provided feelings, sadly just none of them good. And poor Charlie just looking like a big chump.  There is more but others have really covered it.  I mean how much disappointment can one book hold?!?    The one thing I did like was the other covens & their powers, she could have made a great book out of that story alone.    I am to the point, I really hope they DO NOT make this into a movie.
1573223085|5.0|A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink was assigned for a graduate course.  It was a summer course where we were squeezing a semester into 1 week.  What we needed was another book to read.  HOWEVER, once I began reading it, I was hooked.  I read some of it aloud to my husband who became so interested he read it after me.  We have passed it on to our best friends.  I can't wait for my college-age daughter to read it and give me her opinion.  This is a book that will be interesting to a broad range of people.
B000002INJ|5.0|I. Wheels Of Fire.<br /><br />To the rumbling sounds of a thunderous engine, or \\"Iron Horse\\", as it were, followed by an explosively fierce launch into the album, Wheels of Fire leaves burning trails, threatening to immolate any who would dare stand in the path of True Metal.<br /><br />II. Kings Of Metal.<br /><br />The War Machine rumbles forth, conquoring city after city, whose warriors in each province rise up in these veritable concert hall rallies.<br /><br />Considered the \\"loudest band in the world\\", it is interesting to note that on one occasion, a club ceiling literally began to crack as the walls trembled to the massive custom speakers, which is one of the reasons why they prefer to primarily play outdoor events. Besides that designation, other credits include:<br /><br />* The first metal band to include sword & sorcery imagery in both their lyrics and on their album covers.<br />* The only band ever to record with Orson Welles.<br />* Among the first metal bands to record with an orchestra.<br />* The first band to design and build their own speaker cabinets and now their own guitars as well.<br />* The first metal band to record in Dolby 5.1 and be the spokespersons for SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc).<br />* The loudest band in the world (a record they have broken on three separate occasions).<br /><br />III. Heart Of Steel.<br /><br />Ballad: A bitter-sweet reflection of the Mighty-Minded, born with an unconquorable quintessence, where there is no retreat, for there must be no defeat.<br /><br />IV. Sting Of The Bumblebee.<br /><br />Instrumental: This bass guitar rendition of 'Flight of The Bumblebee' by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, provides an amazingly passionate and furious performance basically unheard of until now, taking the bass guitar into incredible feats. The Four-String battle axe wielded by Joey DeMaio, strikes heavy with expert precision, providing an unforgettable listening experience.<br /><br />V. The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings).<br /><br />\\"High and Mighty, alone we are Kings... Whirlwinds of Fire we ride... Providence brought us the Crown and The Ring... Covered with blood and Our Pride...\\"<br /><br />So sings a chorus of warriors in-between melancholy observations of the harsh realities of a man o' war.<br /><br />VI. Kingdom Come.<br /><br />Looking forward to ultimate rulership, with a prognostication of new Kings. One can really hear the vocal talents of Eric Adams here, who sounds like an eagle descending upon its prey.<br /><br />VII. Pleasure Slave.<br /><br />A favorite. Inclusive in the spoils of war, is that of the pleasures of the flesh with beautiful women - the natural indulgence in lust. A Dominant / Submissive dynamic underlies this song - The Master and His willing slave/s...<br /><br />VIII. Hail And Kill.<br /><br />An seemingly inspirational war call to rouse the troops, motivating towards a victorious mindset to conquer and dominate the enemy.<br /><br />IX. The Warrior's Prayer.<br /><br />\\"Gods Of War I Call You... My Sword Is By My Side... I Seek A Life Of Honor, Free From All False Pride... I Will Crack The Whip With A Bold And Mighty Hail... Cover Me With Death If I Should Ever Fail... Glory, Majesty, Unity... Hail Hail Hail\\"<br /><br />Narration: A young boy asks his grandfather to regale him with war stories from his youth, which he does, recounting a spectacle of epic splendor, combined with exquisite sounds from the battle. A superb visualization.<br /><br />Of note, The Four Riders from the corners of the earth, each bearing a different weapon who lead the armies of the world...<br /><br />X. Blood Of The Kings.<br /><br />...'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king!\\"<br /><br />Likened Ragnarok, the warriors are admonished to rage forth and slay the opponents' kings for a new order.

031606792X|1.0|I am not even finished with the book yet, and still I am deeply disappointed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books, found them original and highly entertaining.  I was thrilled to hand them over to my teenage daughter because of the themes of sacrifice and self discipline, not to mention the notion of 'wait for sex until you get married'!  But this book is a mess.  It's badly edited,  entirely too long, there are way too many story threads and the author is trying to wrap it all up too neatly.  I know it's a bad sign when I keep flipping to the end to see how many pages I have left before I'm done.  I literally could walk away from the book right now and never give a moment's thought to how it all turns out for the Cullen clan.  Normally when I read the last book in a series, I experience a profound sense of loss, knowing I am about to lose my 'friends'.  With this one, I just want them all to GO AWAY!  I am probably alone here, but I would have been happy had the author ended the series with book  3.  Margaret Mitchell didn't do so badly with leaving the end of the story up to the imagination of her readers!
0143038419|5.0|I had put off reading this book for a long time because the title turned me off.  One day I decided to read it since it was summer and I had some extra time.  From the first page, I was hooked.  I was so surprised to find the book a delightfully humorous memoir of Gilbert's year finding herself.  There is no preaching and I found lots of depth amidst the humor.  She is one lucky woman to have had the opportunity to spend a year traveling as she did.  There is so much that I could identify with and am very glad that I bought the book and read it.  I know it will be a book I read again and again.  That is quite something since I was initially reluctant to read it.
0345495004|4.0|While I really enjoyed this novel and was captivated by the romance between Mamah and Frank Lloyd Wright in the first few years of the 20th Century, I really LOVED Mamah's character and found her extremely relatable, complex and indeed a woman ahead of her time. Her only condition/vice/weakness was her love for a man not her husband, for which her society shunned her, and perhaps rightly so.     What bothered me about Mamah's character was the ease with which she abandon her children for her own romantic happiness, something I personally find so hard to imagine. However, despite my inabiltiy to comprehend this aspect of her character, I still had enormous respect for her as a woman, admired her lifestyle, and continued to \\"root for her\\" throughout the novel.     While some will argue that Mamah was the love of Frank's life, I never truly felt his love for her came close to hers for him. It is true he abandoned his wife and their children to live with Mamah in Talesin,  however, I believe even if Mamah never come along, his journey may have led him to live apart from them nonetheless. Frank seemed, from this novel, a man obsessed with his work, his ideals, and his idea of truth (despite his affair), all of which he valued above his love for Mamah. While there is no doubt they were in love, it seemed (as the name of the novel suggests) that this is really Mamah's story of loving Frank, more than a love of equality or of her being the love of his life.      I HIGHLY recommend this novel and know avid readers will welcome and love this novel.
B001C08RHA|4.0|The next anticipated movie from the Marvel line of comic books is \\"IRON MAN\\". There has been an overload of comic book films and thankfully, this one doesn`t have \\"Fantastic Four`s\\" quality. \\"Shellhead\\" goes to the big screen courtesy of director Jon Favreau with a solid screenplay by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Yes, the movie is great and as with \\"Spider-Man\\" is the cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be. Yes, everything but it didn't quite unseat \\"Spider-man 2\\" as Marvel's best comic adaptation. (in my opinion)<br /><br />Anthony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist/inventor and dubbed as a \\"Merchant of War\\"; Stark makes most of his fortune making weapons for the military. One day, fate intervenes and Stark finds himself captured and injured by terrorists. With the aid of a man named Yinsen (Shaun Toub), Stark creates a suit of armor from scratch and escapes the clutches of the terrorists.<br />This experience had apparently affected Stark in a life-changing way. Now he intends to use his resources to the betterment of mankind, much to the dismay of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). To atone for his sins, Stark builds a steel-mesh suit and becomes the ultimate human fighting machine...<br /><br />When I said that the film is a cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be, it is because the screenplay carries references to the Shellhead's comic series from his very origin. Never try to \\"fix\\" something that's not broken. The backdrop has been changed from Vietnam to Iraq; and this is a very clever move since it does relate to current events. Characters from the comic make a appearance; Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Yinsen, Obadiah Stane (strong references to \\"Ultimate Iron Man\\"), Jarvis the robotic assistant (Jarvis the butler was probably avoided due to similarities to Batman's Alfred) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). S.H.I.E.L.D., \\"War Machine\\" and the Avengers Initiative anyone? The film carried a surmountable amount of teases that can have the avid comic fan very excited. Writers Fergus and Ostby definitely did their homework on this one.<br /><br />All these factors and the solid direction by Favreau makes for a very entertaining fun movie. The direction has near-excellent structure. I didn't notice any plot holes at all and the execution is solid, the direction knew exactly what it wanted to do and sticks to it. This can be a double-edged sword and I'll explain in a minute. I truly commend the first act of the film as Stark is portrayed as a man very much in for himself who realizes the consequences of his inventions. Why is it so much easier to invent weapons of destruction than to make things to advance mankind? The film does have a strong moral message and a nice touch of humanity. We're fallible, but what matters is how we make our following choices.<br /><br />The film is also blessed with a great cast. Downey does make a good Tony Stark, and the supporting cast does mesh well. Gwyneth Paltrow's \\"Pepper Potts\\" may seem a little \\"doopie\\" but I rather thought that it was her character in the comic. Tony is a playboy and boy, I was very amused by his escapades. Hopefully, the cast is signed for its sequel. The action scenes are decently shot and the best one I think is Shellhead's invasion into enemy territory. The battle with \\"Iron Monger\\" is a little short and not exactly as bone-crushing as I would've preferred it to be but I suppose it fits the film's pace. Boy, the CGI can trample the EFX in \\"Tranformers\\". Shellhead is a \\"global\\" super-hero with concerns that surpass bank robberies and criminals.<br /><br />Now, before anything else, let me make it very clear that I really thought that \\"Iron Man\\" is a great movie. Great structure, AMAZING special effects that puts most CGI to shame and clever dialogue. But the film seemed too `safe\\" and while the script was very good, it just didn't feel that it was willing to take risks and somehow, I think it didn't realize its full potential. The villain is a little underwhelming and as to be expected, the hero will encounter his exact opposite, that ends up being predictable. Just who is Obadiah Stane in the comic book? He is the man who trampled Stark to the ground and drove him to alcoholism. The man should be cunning and evil, not reduced to a power hungry, greedy businessman.  As great as the movie is, it just didn't offer any surprises and I felt like I was just watching just another \\"super-hero\\" movie and I`m ready for the next one. Maybe if this came before the first \\"Spider-man\\" (that launched the super-hero new wave) then this film would be just awe-inspiring. The film just put me in very familiar territory that I really felt as if it was the same old thing. Some scenes proved too silly for my tastes but it was still entertaining. Are these signs of super-hero overdose?<br /><br />Despite the feeling of \\"super-hero\\" burnout, the villain becoming too routine and with the film being too \\"safe\\" for its own good, I really believe \\"Iron Man\\" is still a great effort in the super hero genre. At least, it knew what it wanted to do; entertain the young and old alike. The film is not pretentious and despite the limits it imposed on itself, the film is a very entertaining and a great summer film. Undoubtedly, this film will stand as one of the best super-hero flicks to grace movie theaters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B0017HRCQU|3.0|...I did everything I could to get the latest software updates to my BDP-S1 Blu Ray player in preparation for this disk. By the time I did all the updates I had the very latest software right off of Sony's website. It looked great once I finally got it playing (which took 3 or 4 attempts for some reason - again may have been my player). However, I had to watch the entire movie before finally seeing the DVD menu with the extra features. I really wanted to watch the Dark Knight movie preview right away so that bummed me out. Also, once you finally do get to it, the menu looks very hastily put together. It just had a very rushed, \\"beta\\" edition feel to it. Normally I really don't care about the bells and whistles on DVDs, but I had an exceptionally difficult time dealing with this disk, which is a bummer because this is one of my all time favorite movies.
B000YPUFAG|4.0|I usually hate movies like this, but there was an element to all the RE movies that I liked. I saw this in the theater, so I'm not commenting on the quality or features of this UMD disc. A solid 4+ star movie despite being somewhat predictable and another sequel. MJ's character is amazing and believable. Yeah, the outfit rocked too.
B0017XOF5A|2.0|The quality of the image compression was the same as the up-converted DVD of Ark of Truth I just watched a few days before.  There was no comparison in watching the Arctic scenes (so-so) vs Planet Earth Blu-Ray (great).  Not sure why they'd even release this as blu-ray unless they're pulling a fast one.    The story had holes in it bigger than the gate itself.  When time changed, people were disappearing like Back to the Future style. poof?  The paradoxes are ridiculous..  like why is Baal able to travel back and stop the stargate from arriving in the US.  if he did that, he wouldn't know about Earth in the first place.  where did Baal get Anubis's ship?  how did Daniel's leg reappear?  why make mitchell the hero?  you'd think for a $7mil budget, they'd pull a better script together.    I think the only thing I enjoyed was Vala as a villain.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was definitely not what I expected to end a series of books that I truly became engulfed in and loved. However, I wasn't disappointed. I honestly believe that Stephanie Meyer wrote a book filled with the happiness of writing something you truly enjoy. So it's not my place to quarrel what someone else has imagined. The fact of the matter is, is that this is a work of fiction. In the world that Meyer created where vampires do exist, Bella could only live for Edward, she could get pregnant, and she could have the ultimate happy ending. Via crazy twist and turns! The fact that people can get so worked up over meaning and tone and analyze a book to death is beyond me, especially when its a story about vampires, werewolves and becoming immortal! I'm amazed at how some people can't stretch their imaginations enough, who cares about Bella being married and having sex by 18. That world of fiction is not the tangible one we exist in. Meyer even makes that clear in Eclipse, when Bella mentions how in a normal world she would be with Jake. But she isn't in a normal world, under normal circumstances and so belongs with Edward. Besides, if all you're worried about is some crazy intention on the part of Stephanie Meyer to condone getting married and having sex at a young age, I think this book is the least of your worries. Bella and Edward may be young but they hardly fall into the category of horny uneducated teenagers who have sex because everyone else is. How about we take a closer look at the parents who are \\"parenting\\" these teenagers instead of pointing a finger at an author who wrote a book and gave you the CHOICE to read it. I chose to read this book, and just because Bella and Edward had sex, doesn't mean I'm running out the door with Stephanie Meyers encouragement. People can get so caught up in their virtues and ethics that they forget to think for themselves.    Anyway, this is supposed to be a review for a book I did enjoy. I'm incredibly glad Bella gother incredibly perfect happy ending. The world and life can be so unbalanced and cruel that I don't need to be reminded of the \\"realities\\" of it. For once, for freaking once, someone had the guts to just give me what I wanted. A sweet ending, to an incredible love story. The end.
034547581X|5.0|This isn't a book about John Wayne's war. It's about William Tecumseh Sherman's war, the man who said, \\"War is Hell...\\"    The actual quote from Sherman, a future president of LSU, was \\"There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell...\\"    This book is about that hell, the hell of Vietnam where technology came fact to face with hand-to-hand combat. It was bloody, it was brutal...But it was also heroic.  \\"Heroic\\" not in the sense of a John Wayne movie, but in the sense of heroism described in Walter Lord's epic book on the Alamo, \\"A Time To Stand:\\" \\"All men know fear. Perhaps, in the end, the hero is the one who, knowing that fear, marches on...\\"    There were lots of heroes in the Ia Drang Valley in November of 1965. This book is about those heroes--on both sides.      Written by General Hal Moore and journalist Joe Gallaway, who were there, this book addresses the heroism and humanity of that battle--- the first direct confrontation of American \\"helicopter soldiers\\" and North Vietnam regulars.  Fought at the very start of the war, it remains the turning point of that war, politically, militarily and otherwise.    It is striking in General Moore's respect and admiration for his men as well as for the men his forces were trying to kill. He felt a deep sense of empathy for the familes of the men who died on both sides.  He is indicative of what a military man should be--He doesn't like the killing, but he does it because it is job, his duty.  Duty, Honor, Country. But he never loses sight of humanity, his humanity, the humanity of his troops and the humanity of the troops--the enemy--they are fighting.    Pages 335-336 (hardback edition)contain a moving descripton of his visit to the family and to the grave of one of his fallen troops. The soldier's widow describs him kneeling at the grave of his soldier.  It may be the highlight of the book. His later reconciliation with Gen. Nguyen Huu An, his Ia Drang adversary, and their subsequent visits to the battlefield make this book even more meaninngful.    If you want to read about the glories of war, go somewhere else--read  fiction, a novel or something. But if you want to read about the realities of war and the men who fight it, this is the book for you.
0064440346|5.0|I just purchased this for my 33 year old sister as she is going through some hard times with a relationship's break up. This book seems to bring comfort as an old memory of similar books that I loved as a child because they helped me feel safe and see the world in a wonderous way. Can't remember all the titles but they include Old Black Witch, Suzy Squirrel, and other various otters, cats, and creatures.
031606792X|3.0|I got breaking dawn the day it came out and when I started to read it the words didn't flow the same as the other three. The beginning for me was a bit slow but, when bella became a vampire it got alittle more interesting. It was annoying that bella had no trouble being a new born vampire AT ALL!! I expected at least a little trouble.... Oh well..
031606792X|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  I can see where the backlash is coming from, but in my opinion, Stephenie wrote this well.  I would love to see more side books.<br /><br />I do wish it had been as exciting as the first.
0689878451|5.0|What a charming icebreaker this book is!  I became curious about it once I heard about all the controversy it's been causing.  Frankly I don't see what all the uproar is about.  It's a sweet and innocent true story of two penguins at the Central Park Zoo in New York.  I call it an icebreaker (pun intended) because it calmly breaks down the barrier of awkwardness and opens up the floor to discuss with children the real life existence of same sex parent families and how they're really not much different than all the other parents out there.  This book will help youngsters (and parents) in \\"normal\\" families to understand why a classmate might just so happen to have two dads or two moms.  It merely presents itself as things really are and thus invokes conversation and dialog which leads to understanding of how true love can indeed make a family.   What's the harm in that?  :-)
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I bought \\"All we know is falling\\" on sale,so picked it up and now its one of my favorite cds.I bought the Riot! cd too,so this is a introduction of the band with very well done songs like \\"Pressure\\", \\"Emergency\\",and \\"My Heart\\". I can listen to the whole cd without skipping any songs so its really good.I like the style of \\"My Heart\\" because of the guitar player screams in the background it sounds more rock inspired,however I wish they would make more songs like this.I know most people talk about Hayley but,the whole band is great too,the drumming on \\"My Heart\\" is superb.<br /><br />\\"All we know is falling\\" is a really great debut and this band is new and is amazing that is hard to find these days.I would recommend this cd if you like the Riot! cd.The cd is kind of short its only a little over 30 minutes long,but would rather have quality not quantity(filler tracks).<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"Pressure\\",\\"Emergency\\",\\"Franklin\\",and \\"My Heart\\"<br /><br />Paramore- All We Know Is Falling\\"<br /><br />1.

031606792X|3.0|First, I have to commend Meyer for completing the saga in the first place, as she saw fit, with all its twists and turns.     Now, to be honest, this was the first book in the series that did not hold me from beginning to end. I struggled through Jacob's chapters, to be honest. It was just too much detail for a character who irritated me to no end. I found Meyer rather inconsistent, however. The Jacob in these overly detailed chapters appeared mature and thoughtful. The Jacob that appeared once Bella's storytelling resumed reverted back to the immature, \\"hurt anyone because I am hurt\\", nitwit. Sigh.    While the confrontation with the Volturi was relatively anticlimatic, it was detailed nicely enough to get a sense of the Volturi's own vulnerabilities.    What did I like?  A lot, actually. Bella was a dead woman walking the moment she found out she was pregnant. I don't know about you, but knowing you will die giving birth to your child sounds like sacrifice to me. In becoming a vampire, she also sacrificed a bit of her relationship with her father and mother. Yeah, Meyer whitewashed that as well, but since we never really saw that much of Renee throughout the series, where was the loss? I took Charlie's reaction to be more of someone who knew the truth before even being told.  I enjoyed learning about the other nomads, as well as Bella's discovery of her vampiric self and how she was now at par with Edward, since she was always concerned about that.     Breaking Dawn is not the best of the four book series, but Meyer did a pretty good job wrapping up the series. Because it is fiction, I don't have a problem with the pretty liitle bow, Bella's constant craving for sex (with her husband, Edward, btw), and the baby (I believe Meyer explained how this was possible...not in great detail, but it is there).     I just wonder how the whole imprinting thing would have worked if the baby had been a boy.    Anywho, I gave it three stars because of what I considered too many chapters spent on Jacob's story as well as the non-fight with the Volturi.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|I have watched this movie three times now.  Just think about the concept, a human being just thinking where he wants to be and then being there.  Not only that, taken things with him as he jumps from one location to another.  The concept of the marvel comics superhero teaming up was mentioned from one of the jumpers to the other.  So is the Jumper a superhero?  Actually when you think about it, He is one of the most power superhero ever written on paper.  None of the super hero's could hold him.  He is all powerful.  I love the concept.    There are two types of Jumpers, ones that kill, and others that don't.  But it seem all of them steal.  Money is no object as they can jump into any bank and take what they want.  Jump into any store and what they see is theirs.    I am just crazy about the concept.  The movie I thought was well done.  Doug Liman, the Director can be proud of a job well done.  Hayden Christensen was much more animated than Star Wars.  May God, he is an actor, can you believe it?    Good Job, now please inject me with the solution so I can jump, I need the money.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|[[ASIN:B001BNFR6W Will and Grace: The Complete Series]]    Although it is exciting to see this finally appear in a box set, I wonder if it is the same edition which came out in the UK some time ago?  I was going to order it as it promised many extras, but I then saw a couple of warnings from other buyers saying that many of the episodes had had various lines cut in order for the set to be given a general viewing certificate. For me this would ruin my enjoyment of the series, and would of course nullify the set as being 'complete'.  Does anyone know any more before we place our orders?
0151013837|5.0|Life of Pi by Yann Martel is an exciting, mouth dropping, gruesome, adventurous, hard to put down novel. It is about a 16-year-old Indian boy named Piscine \\"Pi\\" Molitor Patel who lives in Pondicherry, India. Since his father was a zookeeper, Pi learned a great deal about animal behavior and habits. Much to the dismay of his parents, when Pi became older he was very open to different religions. Already a Hindu, he also became a Christian and a Muslim, saying he just wanted to be able to pray to God.           Eventually Pi's father decides to sell their home and move the family to Canada, and sells most of the animals to zoos in America. So on June 21, 1977, with only a small amount of animals, Pi and his family rode on a Japanese cargo ship, called the Tsimtsum, which partway through their trip the ship sinks. The only survivors were Pi, a female orangutan, a hungry hyena, a zebra with a broken leg, and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, all in a 26-foot lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. While the tiger was kept out of sight under a tarp, the relentless hyena continued to inflict pain upon the zebra, and then mercilessly killed the orangutan. The tiger ended up devouring the hyena, which left Pi alone with this carnivore.            Now Pi had to put forth all the energy he had into surviving. He had to figure out what to do with Richard Parker, the source of his fear. He decides to try and tame the tiger. Is that really possible? Can someone tame a full-grown Bengal tiger? Pi was up for the challenge. His life depended on it.            Finally they reached land--an edible algae-covered island. The home of hundreds of meerkats, this island was actually \\"carnivorous\\". After spending a few days on the island, Pi realized that at night this island became highly acidic, and quickly left.           So did Pi survive? After 227 days at sea, did he reach land inhabited with people? Or did he die at the claws of Richard Parker? To find out youmust read this book. If you read between the lines you will be able to see that the author was portraying the fear that Pi felt through the tiger. Martel did a great job with so much detail that I felt I was there in the lifeboat with Pi. Grotesque in places, I do not recommend this book to children, but if you're longing for something that will take you out of the real world and into a world where you don't know what's real and what's imagination, then this is the book for you.
0199205523|3.0|This brief survey educates one about human rights while advocating a very liberal interpretation of them.<br /><br />In truth, I was torn between assigning this book four stars or three. The book itself is quite good, but I found myself getting impatient with it by the end, and I wasn't sure whether it was because of the presentation, or because I found I didn't agree with Mr. Clapham's eagerness to stretch the concept of human rights to cover the widest possible set of circumstances.<br /><br />This is the only volume of the \\"Very Short Introduction\\" series I've read so far, and I find this publishing idea very attractive. I bought the book because I was drawn to the idea of a high-level \\"briefing document\\" approach. What I was hoping for and expecting was a completely balanced treatment, and this is what I feel I did not get.<br /><br />I really appreciated the short potted history of human rights early in the book, and learned many interesting things, such as the role H. G. Wells played in formulating and popularizing the idea of human rights.  But as the book goes on to treat various social-justice issues, such as food, education, housing, work, and discrimination, I felt that I was really reading a progress report on how the human-rights movement has helped to promote a left-wing social agenda worldwide.<br /><br />While there's nothing wrong with being politically progressive, I sense danger in the idea of having \\"human rights\\" overtaken by any one political point of view. For my part, I'm a passionate believer in human rights, but in a much more restricted set of rights than what is envisaged in this book and, apparently, in the human-rights movement generally. But Mr. Clapham is dismissive of those who criticize the \\"politicization\\" of human rights; to him, human rights are about politics, and those who don't see this just don't get it.<br /><br />By the end of the book Mr. Clapham finally takes explicit aim at those who are more reserved in their definition of human rights:<br /><br />\\"Those who insist on a narrow meaning seek to confine human rights to an historically based determination of specific governmental duties to refrain from infringing traditional liberties; the wider vision of human rights allows for consideration of the problems of hunger, poverty, and violence facing billions of people.\\"<br /><br />I suspect that not many people who question Mr. Clapham's liberal interpretation of human rights would accept his characterization of their viewpoint. In a \\"briefing document\\" of this kind, more balance is essential. Also, it would have been good to begin the book with this sentence, so that we could know from the start just how committed the author is to one side of the question.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too harsh. Mr. Clapham does make efforts throughout to present other views, noting that \\"critics say...\\" But it was as though by the end he just could not bear to wear the \\"impartial\\" mask any more.n a narrow meaning seek to confine human rights to an historically based determination of specific governmental duties to refrain from infringing traditional liberties; the wider vision of human rights allows for consideration of the problems of hunger, poverty, and violence facing billions of people.\\"    I suspect that not many people who question Mr. Clapham's liberal interpretation of human rights would accept his characterization of their viewpoint.

0345444051|4.0|What seemed like an ordinary tale of aliens descending upon Earth to take over, turned into a profound work of humanities struggle, not physically, but mentally, with their interactions with their \\"overlords.\\"  Rather than looking at a stereotypical perspective of Aliens raging war with humans, Clarke creates the story of different individuals and their attempts with facing a world of monotony and routine, without individualism.  Clarke exceeds the realm of sci-fi by looking at what it means to be a human.  Great read.
031606792X|1.0|I, like so many others, fell in love with the first three books in the Twilight series.  I couldn't put them down.  I cannot tell you how much I looked forward to Breaking Dawn.  I was there, with millions of others, at midnight.  I had read the first chapter online as well as all of the quotes that Meyer posted on her site.      The first chapter was a typical Twilight chapter and I loved it.  It was downhill from there.  The characters were unrealistic in the sense that they were no longer relatable.  The thing that I loved most about Twilight was that I was always able to relate to each of the characters in one way or another.  The only character that I enjoyed reading about was Jacob.  That is until he imprinted on Nessie (Need I go into to detail about the name?).  In Breaking Dawn, Bella became a character I loathed.  She was extremely selfish/ self-centered (don't misunderstand, she always has been, but in Breaking Dawn, Meyer took it to a whole new level).  In Bella's mind, it was all about her.  When could she see her daughter?  When could she be with Edward?  When would Jacob come to see her?  How could Jacob do something like that to her?  Her, her, her.  I got so tired of reading it.     The first three books were by no means well written.  However, the story was so riveting that I couldn't stop reading.  This book was the complete opposite.  I often found myself thinking \\"Seriously? What? Where is the real book I waited so long for?\\"  Not only was the story out there and unbelievable, it was down right disturbing.  Drinking blood?  Really?  Come on.  In Twilight, Bella said the smell of blood made her sick and now all of the sudden, it smells good to her?  It tastes good to her?  I don't think so.  I also feel that Meyer was at a loss for what to right.  The pregnancy plot line was just over-the-top.  I know this has been said many times before, but I have to agree.  The story was just good fanfiction.       I believe that Meyer lost sight of what Twilight was always really about: the delicate relationship between human and vampire (I realize that Bella was going to become a vampire.  But what about the difficult transition?  What happened to everything Meyer spent three books writing about?).  I feel that she saw and took the opportunity to infuse her own personal beliefs and feelings into the characters' thoughts and actions.      For those of you who loved Breaking Dawn, I'm so glad.  I'm glad you feel that your money was not wasted as I feel that mine was.  If you have not read Breaking Dawn yet,  I strongly advise that you end the series with Eclipse and create your own happy ending.  I am so sad to say that Breaking Dawn tarnished my view of the other three books.  A one star review is one more star than this book deserves.
B00159679S|5.0|Buying this set is a no brainer.  The price for acquiring recordings of all of Wagner's major operas is irresistible.  All of these performances range from good to great.  Although recorded live, audience noise is almost non-existent and the balance between orchestra and singers is very good.  The sound is as good as many of my recordings made in a studio.  I had all recordings of all of these operas before buying this set.  However, getting to hear other performances of these works was too pricey for me.  This was a terrific way to add to my CD opera collection and hear recordings that I had coveted (Bohm's Ring for example) but would not have had the chance to experience.  I recommend buying this set while it is still available.  It will become a collector's item.
0316067601|1.0|I bought this book believing I would get into the heart and soul of a Navy SEAL and come to understand some of the subtleties of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.     Unfortunately, the book is so filled with bravado and testosterone that it offers almost no lens on the war and the challenges of being in a difficult strategic _and_ tactical battle situation.     If you want to hear about how many pull-ups a SEAL can do, buy this book.     If you want a well-rounded, thoughtful, open-minded analysis of the life of a SEAL in the morally tenuous wars we find ourselves in, take a pass.     Anyone who blindly kills on demand, is 100% loyal to the president regardless of the decisions that leader makes, and who cannot introspect about the situation at hand needs to reboot their hard drive and rediscover what it is to be human, humane, and a warrior at the same time.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|This film has become a cult film with time. Everything seems to be at that level though the situation and plot are rather light. What is important here is that Hitchcock transforms this back yard and garden surrounded by buildings all around and a highly voyeuristic microcosm into a complete vision of human society with all its dramas, and its pleasures and joys. To transform such a small microcosm entirely closed onto itself into a vision of the whole society we hardly get a couple of glimpses of through an alley opening onto the main street is marvelous and amazing. The second phenomenal fact is that the main actor is a wheelchair-ridden man with a severely broken leg in a cast. How can the whole world completely turn and whirl around that sole man? It is only possible because it is absolutely seen through the only eyes of this man or the eyes of the people standing next to him. There is only one instance when the point of vision is not his own eyes but a point outside in the yard-garden: at the end when he is being dropped from his window and then we get for a very short period of time the vision from the cops' eyes. This gives to that film such a personal dimension that it is nearly sickening: we have the impression of invading the privacy of that man. In fact what I have just said is false because he alternates what the man can see and close-up shots on him to show his personal reactions to what he has just seen. This constant alternating of voyeuristic sequences from the eyes of one man and close-up shots on his body language and language forces us into his own skin, body, bones. We are no longer voyeurs but ghosts in him seeing through his eyes. We are the direct witnesses of what he sees because we see it with him, through his own eyes and we start feeling the same emotions as he does. Of course everything is seen through the camera, but Hitchcock even uses some tools to emphasize the voyeuristic dimension and force us into it: a camera with a zooming lens that is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer. The last point I would like to insist on is that Hitchcock shows a murder but he is not interested in the murder per se but in the reactions of the witnesses, those who see everything and how they are blind to what they see. Then he builds up the slow recognition in their eyes, language and behavior, and then they become obsessive about it, to the point of becoming if not courageous at least unconscious of the risks they are taking or running. That too is remarkable and that nearly makes us get out of the simplistic voyeurism I have spoken of all along and climb into some kind of distantiation from the penned up impression of before, a distantiation that leads us to the idea that courage in a human society is often the result of a conviction that makes us blind to the danger or risk we are facing. Courage is the result of a lack of consciousness more than intensified consciousness. This is the human dimension Hitchcock always brought to his films. And that is kind of lost in our modern action films that do not have one single second now and then to just rest and digest what has happened before.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelineshat is so big that the camera becomes minuscule, or binoculars that are of course too big for the distance across the back yard and later the flash bulbs to force us not to see through the eyes of the murderer but to be seen through the eyes of the murderer.

032147404X|5.0|I purchased both this book and the second volume. I can best describe the value of Kelby's books by telling you the following story. I thought I was lending these books to a good friend who's a very highly experienced and gifted professional photographer. After a couple of days he called me and told me how much he liked the books and that it was so nice of me to let him have them! Guess I'm buying them again. Both of us really like Kelby's sense of humor - reminds us of our own conversations. I found the Photoshop sharpening techniques he describes to be superior to all the ways I've tried. Just this one little trick more than paid for the book. Kelby's photos alone make the books a worthwile purchase. I would highly recommend these books as required reading for anyone starting out. They'll most certainly be useful for experienced photographers as well.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I am a big Van Halen fan, and I will say this: After listening to all of their records, I have come to the conclusion that their debut is their finest. In many artists' cases, the debut album is usually one of the weakest in the catalog. But not in Van Halen's case.    1978 was a year of change in rock and roll. The punk rock movement was well underway, and heavy metal was at it's finest. Van Halen emerged; led by Eddie Van Halen, probably one of the best guitarists of our time, and \\"Diamond\\" David Lee Roth as the vocalist.    The debut album has got to be one of the best albums of the '70s. 'Atomic Punk,' 'Running With The Devil,' 'Eruption,' 'You Really Got Me' and one of my personal favorites, 'Ice Cream Man' are all here. Heck, it's practically a greatest-hits album!    And, the sound quality is superb! Warner Bros. has chosen this album to be included in their ongoing Warner Remasters series, giving this the (long needed) remaster it deserves.     Overall, if you were stranded on a desert island, and you had to choose one, just one Van Halen disc to take with you, this would absolutely be my pick. To me, there is no other album quite like this one from Van Halen. All of them are great, but this is the best.    Highly recommended for any Van Halen. I don't care if you are one who only buys the best-ofs and greatest-hits albums, you still need to have this album in your collection.    Highly recommended. A must own!    ENJOY!!!
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Those of you saying the 2nd and 3rd movies are horrible maybe just didn't understand them. Someone actually said the cake scene was bad! I wonder if they just didn't understand the deeper meaning behind that scene and the others. The writers just continued the analogies in the 2nd and 3rd movies and I found the ideas and philosophies to be very deep and thought provoking. I do however agree that the ending could have been better. But alas, we all have opinions and mine is certainly no more authoritative than any of these others. I however don't claim that my opinion is the truth. Those of you claiming these movies were crap should temper that with a little humility.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I've been watching the entire Otto Preminger catalog lately, and I got around to seeing what is arguably his most famous film.  Seeing it again makes me realise that it's a masterpiece of tension, performances, dialogue, and cinematography.<br /><br />There is so much to like about this film.  Nothing here in the trial or the characterisations is present in black and white (there's even a dialogue by Stewart to a potential witness about how people aren't black and white).  It is full blown ambiguity, resulting in a far more grown up and mature film than most current courtroom dramas are.  It is also refreshingly un-PC, unlike modern courtroom dramas.  I like to constrast this film with overblown, incredibly melodramatic shows like The Practice, which I used to watch simply because it was unintentionally hilarious, because everyone was so over the top (and this was before it changed into Boston Legal with William Shatner, the ultimate ham sandwich of an actor).  Preminger's film is one of his masterworks, a great study of the legal system, a fascinating case of two intelligent, well equipped lawyers having a go for a somewhat sleazy client, and a very dramatic and stunning film.<br /><br />Stewart is masterful here, playing the usual Jimmy Stewart character but with a more cynical side which suits him very well.  Ben Gazarra is great as a bullying, prone to violence soldier, and Remick is outstanding as his hoochie, borderline slutty wife.  Scott as a district attorney is mesmerizing in one of his first roles.  Even the supporting performances are outstanding, with Murray Hamilton excellent as a bartender, Eve Arden as Stewart's secretary, and Joseph Welch, who is the judge of the case.  Despite the fact that you will probably figure out how the jury will rule, the film is still rivetting.  The confrontation between Remick and Scott is incredibly tense (enhanced by Preminger's long take style), and the final cross examination by Scott and a surprise witness is totally devastating.<br /><br />Otto Preminger is very underrrated in cinema circles today, and I hope that opinion changes soon.  This is one of his best films, and one of the best courtroom dramas ever made.  It still holds up, despite scores of imitations and the explicitness of today's courtroom dramas.ng.

031606792X|3.0|There is so much possibility for this series!  It always seems to fall short of it's potential, though.  As with the rest of the series, there is a major battle climax that is never completed.  I expected more action than this, and I don't even care all that much for action.  I get the feeling the writer is very non-confrontational by the way she truly avoids fight scenes.<br /><br />This is the first book/series I have ever read that I can honestly say the movie looks BETTER.  It seems the directors, at least, know how to create action.<br /><br />That said, there were some things I really loved about this new addition, such as the new addition herself.  Renesmee (though I hate that name) is adorable and special and just a delight to read about.  I really loved how she was added in, but it brings me to another part which I hated.  Jacob's imprint.<br /><br />The fact that a man \\"imprints\\" on a newborn is just creepy to me.  Imprinting, for those unfamiliar, is like finding one's soulmate.  It's just creepy to me that she would write this about one of the main characters, and for a youbng audience at that.  Granted, nothing will happen until the child is grown, but I think this is a sensitive subject that I certainly wouldn't want my children reading about then thinking some pedophile in real life is good.  I know that's stretching it, but as a mother it really sent off red flags for me!<br /><br />Overall though, this was  adecent addition to the series.  I wish it didn't end there.  The 2nd book is still my favorite, because of Jacob, but Jacob fans will love he has a whole part in the new book from pov.

B00005ASGG|1.0|This is an unintentional parody of the Western movie.  The cliches, stereotypes, corny lines, and macho nonsense are present in abundance.  There are signs of trouble from the beginning, when we learn immediately that there will be a flashback: Jimmy Stewart is shouting his lines.  Later, John Wayne swaggers and sniggers, Andy Devine whimpers and attempts to be amusing, Edmund O'Brien does an awful drunk act, things are rowdy in the local saloon...well, you understand if you're over 13.  Watch how fast Stewart recovers from a savage beating after he sips some brandy.  And don't miss the by now obligatory civil rights salute.  The ending is wholly predictable.  My educated guess is that John Ford, Lee Marvin, and many others on the set were tipping the bottle a bit too much. This is a dreadful, if often quite funny, film.  It was Ford's worst, Stewart's worst, and ranks at least fourth from the bottom in Wayne's career.
031606792X|1.0|*WARNING: WILL PROBABLY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br /><br />Unlike many of the other reviewers, I was not a big fan of any of the characters prior to the final book.  I read the books because I found them amusing, and I read a lot of young adult fantasy/sci-fi.  When my friend gave me Twilight to read, she prefaced the offering by noting, \\"you will like this, but it is the most anti-feminist book ever.\\"  And it was.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first two books, but I am an adult woman (in my early twenties).  I would have serious qualms about giving this book to a young girl, if she, like I was in youth, would be likely to take its messages to heart.  Even someone like V. C. Andrews (back in the day) was at least so over the top that hopefully teens could realize that the messages in all of her novels were not to be taken seriously.  But Meyer seems wholly unaware that offering a heroine who throws her entire sense of self and future and mortal life out the window for an attractive man who has the capacity to KILL her accidentally is deeply disturbing.  And all the parallels between the werewolves' relationships and abusive relationships are disturbing as well, not to even get into the ickiness that is imprinting on a toddler/baby (I had flashes of \\"Gigi\\"!!).  And Jacob forcing Bella to kiss him?  ICK.<br /><br />But on to this final installment.  Meyer is determined to make Bella a vampire, which I find genuinely distastful.  The \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" vibe of her entire conception/pregnancy/delivery is horrifying and the feeling that the ridiculously named Reneesme was some late season-\\"Angel\\" demon parasite that manipulated people to like her seemed more plausible than the actual (she makes people love her by touching their cheeks!  whoo!).  And we get treated to yet another extrememly bizarre fight in which Bella must BEG her HUSBAND to sleep with her (have they ever considered oral? frankly they are unimaginative).  And after Bella's transformation all her former memories are blurry, which in some ways basically negates the value of her past actions, and of who she was in general.<br /><br />Stephenie Meyer's message: love surpasses all, including: sense of self, independent personality, future (education), family ties.  In order to sleep with the man you love (because he is too violent to controll himself when he is with you) you must forfeit your own beating heart and embrace a new self that is better than who you were before because you are worthless without him.<br /><br />Also of note: Meyer's intense obsession with 'perfection.'  Is this the 50s?  Perfect is a thin veneer, underneath is strain and conflict and rising perversion.<br /><br />So basically, if you can laugh off Meyer's bizarre ideas about seemingly EVERYTHING relating to male/female dynamics and sexual behavior then these books are peachy keen.  But if you seriously think Edward is dreamy and want to find someone to stalk you and sleep in your bed with you secretly for months and refuse to sleep with you unless you get married at eighteen you need to step away from her books and find something less screwy.  I recommend L.J. Smith and Diana Wynne Jones.ays basically negates the value of her past actions, and of who she was in general.

B00005JPO1|4.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is perhaps about as good as one could expect after all these years, the biggest problem with it is that while I remember the excitement-a-minute of the first three films, regarding this new one and bringing up Hannibal Lecter: \\"my pulse never got above 80\\". The biggest complaint I have about the movie has to do with the complexity of the plot: two thirds into the film I had no idea what exactly Indy was going after. Remember how in Raiders every bit of the way you felt how critical it was for Indy to get the Ark ? Not here. As a result I just didn't care too much about what was going on. I also don't think Shia LaBeouf has the chops for inheriting the Indiana Jones role, I have no idea who does but certainly not him. I suppose you just can't expect Spielberg and Lucas to catch thunder in a bottle every time (see Raiders) so one has to value this new film for what it is: a good time at the movies, nothing more.

A total reformation from coldplay's soft metro gweneth paltrow tainted past selves.  Violet Hill's steady battle entry drumbeat pounds you out of your world of mundane and into theirs of war, death, and longing.  It's a perfect creation in this place and time.  The context of a world on the brink of revolution is where we are at right now, and we need skillful artists like coldplay to elegantly see us through it.  Beautiful
1400063515|5.0|This is a very fun book to read.  Taleb is one of those polymath writers who are totally unashamed to bloviate and utterly convinced he's right (and is willing to call Nobel laureates frauds).  I give him credit for making statistics engaging to read and a philosophy to boot.    My one criticism is his chapter on narrative fallacies.  One of Taleb's arguments is that we should avoid seeing patterns in the past and that the past is almost entirely unexplainable and irreducible with respect to causation.  He then applies this to history.  I think Taleb's dead wrong here.  It is absurd to think of history without thinking about causation and narrative.  History is not naked chronology, as Taleb seems to think, but understanding reasons, causes.  People don't want to know what happened, but why it happened.  This is a valid question!  IMHO, Taleb's argument about randomness and skepticism applies only to economic variables.  And it's a good point.  In sum, I thought Taleb's romp through the world of economics and forecasting was fun and thought-provoking.
0553588486|4.0|The problem with George RR Martin's A Game of Thrones is that it is a good book.  No, that's not a typo- the problem with this book is that it is genuinely different from most fantasy offerings, highly entertaining, and well developed.  Of course with such achievements comes praise, hype, and hoopla.  Before long the hype actually surpasses the book's merits and expectations going in are so high that no book, regardless of how good it really is, can measure up.<br /><br />And that pretty much summarizes my own foray into The Song of Ice and Fire saga.  12 years and 1,500 reviews late, I've finally begun my tour of the series by ordering and reading A Game Of Thrones.  With so much praise that's been heaped upon the story (and the series in general) throughout the years, my expectations were understandably high.  Even still I found the first book to be enjoyable, entertaining, and definitely worthy of the attention it receives.<br /><br />To begin, Bantam Spectra is only partially correct in labeling this book Fantasy.  The truth of the matter is that the prose is easily as much a study in drama (and oftentimes borders on historical) as it is a fantasy effort.  Sure there is mention of some mythological races, a few undead corpses, and even some baby dragons in the mix, however GRRM does not present this work in the fashion so commonly associated with the genera.<br /><br />It is well documented that GRRM takes the approach of telling his tale by breaking it into chapters each focusing on a specific character somehow entwined in the greater whole.  In my opinion, doing so created a double-edged sword (no pun intended).  On the one hand the massive and character-riddled plot feels more personal and the different viewpoints showcase Martin's ability as a master storyteller.  After all, he manages to convincingly depict an 8-year-old cripple just as well as a young woman's (oft brutal) sexual encounters.  There's no question interweaving a story in this fashion is a testament of skill and confidence on the author's behalf.  On the other hand, some characters just click better than others.  I personally found Tyrion to be very interesting as well as Eddard Stark but they are merely a small sample of the greater whole that is the cast of A Song of Ice and Fire.  As a result, readers will often find themselves slogging through chapters that deal only with lesser-liked (or hardly relevant) characters in effort to return to the story arc they are most interested in.  I should note that this criticism seems to be more prevalent in the later books than this particular entry.<br /><br />Overall, I found the general consensus of this book to be pretty spot-on.  While I realize that being one of 1500 reviews, its unlikely my opinion will have much impact, but I did want to share my take on account of the fact that I am a fervent reader of fantasy fiction who, like many others, grew tired of the same formulaic plots that seem so common in most fantasy these days.  The line between good and evil is blurred in Martin's series so effectively that it doesn't take long to start to sympathize with the goals and aspirations of each of the groups involved.  I'm deeper into the series at the time of this review's writing and sometimes I still get the overwhelming feeling that perhaps I'm rooting for the wrong side!<br /><br />Considering the level of expectation that the positive reviews of the past 12 years have generated, I was sure I would be let down.  Yet GRRM delivered and now I too have become a member of the hordes eagerly awaiting the release of A Dance With Dragons.onfidence on the author's behalf.

B000VNMMR0|3.0|All of you are taking this movie way too seriously. Its an ACTION movie. Not a documentary. Did you actually expect that you were going to gain some inspiring, intellectual knowledge from watching this movie? Lighten up! Its supposed to be entertaining and implausible. And yes, all 4 of these Die Hard movies have implausible scenarios. I guess none of you are big fans of Jason Bourne or James Bond, huh? I thought it was entertaining. And while I'm not a computer geek, I didn't find the computer jargon to be all that complicated to understand and it was minimal at best.
0743454537|5.0|My friend turned me on to this author and though I have only read two of her books I think she is a genius. This is one of my favorite books, finally someone stands up for herself. I love the fact that the little girl  in this book has such a voice. There are not many books that portray kids as someone who will stand up for them selfs. Although many people may hate the ending, I love irony and I think that she was genius to make such a twist. I love it and would recommend this book to everyone.
0316166685|5.0|that this book isn't about happy endings. That is what Alice is trying to tell everyone. With this book she gets to write the story about how screwed up the world is. This wasn't a story that had a happy ending because most stories in life don't. She is a very kind person to share her stories with us. She teaches people (who want to listen) that when something horrible happens some good can come out of it, but in the end the horrible thing should not be forgotten. Just because something horrible happened doesn't mean the world should be ignorant and turn the other cheek. We should learn about it and maybe someday help someone through their struggle or maybe it can help you through one of your struggles.

0743290119|3.0|Lauren Weisberger's \\"Chasing Harry Winston\\" centered around three thirty-something women living in New York City who were single and who made a pact to change something significant in their dating lives. Emmy was recently dumped by her long-time boyfriend for a twenty-two year old personal trainer, decided that she will no longer be involved in monogamous relationship but will sleep with as many men as she could with no commitments. Adriana, a stunning Brazilian whose life involved just seducing men, will commit herself to just one man. Leigh, an editor working in a publishing powerhouse, did not make any commitment in the pact. However, she was in a relationship with the perfect man, and yet she did not feel that she was in love with him.    Having read the negative reviews of this book, I was pleasantly surprised that the novel was better than I expected. The pace of the book was fast, characters somewhat likeable, and the plot (even though it was predictable) was interesting enough to keep reading. This was no \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" but was still a good summer read.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|The main character in this movie is a person of few words and blunt statements, which is the opposite of what the main character of the novel is.  She should love language, revel in banter -- everything the film version does not offer.  Without this love of spoken language, the character is unbelievable when she actually speaks the lines of the novel's character in important scenes.  Suddenly, her speach becomes elevated and exacting, whereas she normally just grunts responses.  In fact, this is about the worst script version of the story have seen.  It seems that the makers of the movie didn't believe that a modern audience could appreciate a literate character, so they dumbed her down.

B00012FXAE|4.0|This isn't so much a strict sequel to Alien as it is a re-imagining of the Alien mythos. As one of the greatest horror films ever made, Aliens couldn't possibly have been an acceptable follow-up if Cameron had tried making it a horror film. Luckily, the very smart decision was made to turn Aliens into an action-thriller film, and it succeeds. Aliens, while an entirely different sort of film, is taut, engaging, and very well-made.    The characters and plot are nothing special here. In Alien, the real star of the show was the Nostromo. The dark, claustrophobic spaceship provided the perfect backdrop for Giger's shadowy creation to stalk around. In Aliens, the aliens themselves are the stars. Whereas we never get too clear a picture of the adult alien in the first film (even at the end, the creature is still guised in shadow), aliens are quite clearly visible in this film. The special effects are magnificent. The queen alien is perhaps one of the most majestic and terrifying creatures ever to appear in a film. And Ripley's final descent into the collapsing hive is a visceral and disturbing descent into Hell itself.    The action is intense, the various moments of anticipation are nerve-wracking, the special effects are eye-popping, and the story, if more conventional, is adequate for the purposes of the film. The acting is a bit weak in some areas, but not enough to be distracting. Overall, this is a solid and entertaining film, and one of the few instances where a sequel actually manages to be decent.

B000XA5K48|2.0|What is it with Clive Owen and his choice of films to do? He was great in The Croupier and interesting as an assassin the first Bourne film, but here and in several other films (I'll Sleep When I'm Dead) he just isn't believable as a dumb, sadistic, violent guy--he's too smart to play that.    Here in Shoot em Up his character has no back story; his action scenes are fine but too unbelievable to be more than 'cartoonish', and his gorgeous love interest (Monic Bellucci) seems way too smart to be with such a simple 'thug'.    Add to the continuous action a bad guy (Paul Giamatti) who also seems unbelievable and you've got a mindless waste of time. And one more thing; this movie has a scene of nudity that is really disgusting and should have been cut--and I'm not speaking of any scene involving Monica Bellucci.
B00005JMUA|4.0|WARNING: This review contains spoilers!    Note: Before reading this review for Kill Bill Vol. 2, please read my review for [[ASIN:B00005JMEW Kill Bill Vol. 1]] to avoid confusion.    Quentin Tarantino (Jackie Brown and Kill Bill Vol. 1) delivers the second half of his epic revenge melodrama, Kill Bill, with his usual stylistic flare. As with Vol. 1, he gives tribute to the many genres* that have inspired him since his childhood. Unlike Kill Bill Vol. 1, Vol. 2 focuses more on human drama rather than gory action but it still packs a punch. The story is more typical of Tarantino's writing, relying heavily on witty banter between immoral characters who suffer the delusion that they are following some strict code of honor. Another difference between Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 is the tone of the film. Vol. 1 is very much an amalgamation of samurai, blaxploitation, and revenge melodrama. Vol. 2 is more of a spaghetti western/kung fu/dysfunctional family drama.    Kill Bill Vol. 2 continues The Bride's quest for revenge against her former boss/lover, Bill, who four years earlier massacred her husband-to-be and her friends during her wedding rehearsal. But Bill has a secret: the daughter that The Bride was pregnant with, whom she believed to have been killed, is alive and happily living with her father, Bill. And for the first we are shown how The Bride became the killer that she is. We see her cruel tutelage under kung fu master Pai Mei, who takes her past the breaking point and keeps pushing her to excel. We see the day that she realized she was pregnant and decided to leave killing behind her. And we see the day that the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) killed her friends before putting her in a coma. With all of these events in mind, The Bride continues down the blood-soaked path to vengeance. #3 on her \\"Death List\\" is Bill's younger brother, Budd, who has no intention of becoming just another splatter mark leading to Bill. When The Bride shows up, Budd is waiting witha shotgun and a shovel. He shoots her in the chest and then buries her alive in the desert. Budd plans on selling The Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword to Elle Driver, #4 on The Bride's \\"Death List\\" and one of the top members of the Deadly Vipers, but Elle is lethally cunning and she despises Budd for killing The Bride before she had the chance to do it herself. Little does she know that The Bride has escaped from her premature burial site and is on her way to kill Budd (who is already dead thanks to Elle). When The Bride arrives, she and Elle duke it out in an intimately savage fight which ends in an unexpectedly abrupt manner. Without stopping for respite or recovery, The Bride Travels to Acuna Mexico where she looks up an old retired pimp, Esteban Vihaio, who served as a father figure to Bill. It is from Esteban that she finally learns the location of Bill himself. The Bride hits the road once again and it's not long before she reaches her destination where Bill is waiting with their daughter, B.B.. Bill and The Bride hide their vendetta from their daughter but after she's safely tucked into bed they confront one another. After a long discussion about the nature of heroes and dual identities, about leading a double life of mediocrity and intrigue, they fight briefly. In the end Bill is, of course, dead but so is The Bride. She lives on in a new incarnation, not as The Bride, a killer, but as Mommy. Mommy and B.B. drive off into the sunset and live happily ever after.    There have been some critics who have been disappointed with the film's climactic showdown between The Bride and Bill. Most of them complained that either Bill's death was too simple and dignified or that the final duel should have been more of a spectacle like the final battle in the first film. However, upon close examination the ending is entirely appropriate, both emotionally and pragmatically. All this time The Bride has been a stoic and impersonal killer and only when she was with Bill or when shewas pregnant was she intimate and human. This duality was necessary in her violent line of work, but when she kills Bill she is released from this shifting imbalance and made whole. Only when he is dead can she become human again and act as a mother to her daughter. It is this removal of evil from the world that gives her the strength to survive and redeem herself. She's no longer The Bride, she's simply Mommy; a woman freed from the cruelties of men, a mother who does not attack but to defend her offspring. It's odd but the film which started off as a tribute to genre films and exploitation is in the end an ironic allegory for feminism and non-violence.  The cast (as always is the case in Tarantino's films) is wonderful especially Uma Thurman as The Bride/Mommy, Michael Madsen as Budd, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, David Carradine as Bill, and Gordon Liu as Pai Mei.    Special features include The Making of Kill Bill Vol. 2, a performance by Robert Rodriguez' band Chingon, and a deleted scene.    * Here are some of the films which inspired Q.T. to make Kill Bill:  [[ASIN:B000OPOAOI A Fistful of Dollars]]  [[ASIN:B000OPOAP2 For a Few Dollars More]]  [[ASIN:6301971272 The Good, the Bad & the Ugly]]  [[ASIN:B000BT96CS The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut]]  [[ASIN:B000OPOANO Duck, You Sucker]]  [[ASIN:B000X07TLA Kung Fu - The Complete Series Collection]]  [[ASIN:B000MM0LE6 Five Fingers Of Death]]  [[ASIN:B000MM0LEG The 36th Chamber of Shaolin]]

B00005JMEW|4.0|WARNING: This review contains spoilers!    Note: In my summary of the plot I have put the film's story into chronological order so that events unfold sequentially. This is not the order in which the events of the film are actually shown.    Quentin Tarantino (director of Reservoir Dogs and  Pulp Fiction) has often been called one of the most violence-obsessed filmmakers in America, a title that he would occasionally protest. Now we can see why he would have objected to it, he simply hadn't earned that honor yet. But let it be known to all that Quentin Tarantino, or Q.T. as he sometimes refers to himself, is now an official auteur of the action film. His bloody kung fu saga, Kill Bill, is proof of this. Here he pays homage to his favorite exploitation films of the `70s and `80s* with the giddy enthusiasm of a teenaged fanboy.    Kill Bill Vol. 1 tells the story of The Bride, a former assassin with the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS), who is brutally attacked and left for dead during her wedding rehearsal by her ex boss/lover Bill. The Bride loses everything and everyone she cares about including her husband-to-be, her friends and her unborn child. After being shot in the head by Bill himself, The Bride sinks into a coma and awakens four whole years later. While she was comatose a hospital nurse sold her body to perverts who would have sex with her. On the day of her resurrection she kills the nurse and the creep who paid to have his way with her, thus beginning a cycle of cold bloody revenge. Her targets: Bill and every one of the Deadly Vipers. Her goal: Kill `em all. Her mission begins with a trip to Japan where she asks the legendary sword maker, Hattori Hanzo, to give her \\"Japanese steel\\". He refuses saying that he no longer makes instruments of death but when she explains that only his swords are up to the task of killing Bill, who was once Hanzo's student therefore making him partially responsible for Bill's wicked deeds, then he agrees to make her hisfinest sword, a katana with no equal. He also warns her that before her journey for revenge can begin that she must be sure that she will not falter no matter what. The Bride then leaves with her new weapon and prepares for an epic battle with O-Ren Ishii, a half Japanese, half Chinese, Asian American who's become the leader of a powerful yakuza crime syndicate.  When O-Ren was just a young girl she witnessed the horrible murders of her father and mother and she vowed revenge. At the age of twelve she fulfilled her desire for blood when she slew the man responsible. She quickly became one of the youngest and deadliest assassins in the world, which is why Bill took her under his wing.  After an amazing showdown with O-Ren and her sword-wielding gang, The Bride hunts down #2 on her list of people to kill, Vernita Green. The Bride and Vernita engage in vicious hand-to-hand combat (with a brief intermission when Vernita's young daughter comes home from school) before Vernita meets her doom before the eyes of her young daughter. But things are never as simple as they seem and \\"Revenge is never a straight line.\\" While The Bride continues on her journey to kill Bill, we learn of a secret that may be her undoing: her daughter, the child that she believed to be dead when she was assaulted on the day of her wedding rehearsal four years earlier, is still alive and living with her daddy, Bill.    Some Tarantino fans have complained that this film is a departure from his dialogue-driven serio-comedies about charismatic criminals and lowlifes, but even as this is true Kill Bill is a definitive Tarantino film. Darkly humorous, graphically violent and as irreverent as always, his films polarize, provoke, and entertain audiences, which is why Kill Bill is quintessentially Quentin.  The film is rounded out by a terrifically diverse cast including Uma Thurman as The Bride, Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Michael Madsen as Budd, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, David Carradine as Bill, and Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo.    The DVD is a must-have for Tarantino fans, however be warned that a more elaborate DVD release may be on the way. Special features include the Making of Kill Bill featurette, two musical performances by the 5,6,7,8s and trailers for Tarantino's other films.    * Here are some of the films and television shows that inspired Q.T. to make Kill Bill:  [[ASIN:B0000AUHPG Once Upon a Time in the West]]  [[ASIN:B000A9QK9Q Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection]]  [[ASIN:B000AYNFVC Lone Wolf and Cub Box Set]]  [[ASIN:B000B5XOTI Fox in a Box - Featuring Pam Grier]]  [[ASIN:B0001I54U2 Lady Snowblood]]  [[ASIN:B000F8O4CC Yakuza Graveyard]]  [[ASIN:B00008WJEZ Charlie's Angels - The Complete First Season]]  [[ASIN:B000FDECGA Shogun Assassin]]  [[ASIN:B000MTFDAQ Shadow Warriors - The Complete First Season]]
1563894696|5.0|I had never read this book before, but had heard somany good things about it.  I picked it up and read the whole thing in one sitting.  An excellent story on Batman taking on organized crime in the early part of his crime fighting carrer.  It is interesting to note how the mob seems to feel threatened by the new breed of criminals starting to take over Gotham(like The Joker, Riddler, Poinson Ivy, and such).  Or, as The Mob call them, \\"Freaks\\".<br />  I do recommend this book, as I myself really enjoyed it.
B00005JPS8|2.0|A big fan of comics, I really, really wanted to like Iron Man, but it left me cold. Wasted talent (Ms. Paltrow (wasted!) & Mr. Bridges, in particular), plot holes, a completely schizophrenic conversion by Tony Stark (\\"I realize that my family's business is war, so I'll rectify that by building a legendary suit of armor, flying around the world and killing people!\\"), and racist portrayals of terrorists, the villian du jour.<br /><br />I started getting bored about 1/2 hour into the movie, and it went downhill from there ...<br /><br />Seriously. Hollywood spends a kabillion dollars on this movie, and this is the best script they can come up with? The script felt completely formulaic, paint-by-numbers, and predictable.<br /><br />Finally ... I seem to be in the minority here, but when I watch Robert Downey Jr. acting, all I see is a man playing Robert Downey Jr. ... in every movie.
B000KJTLDI|5.0|Hunky Dory was Bowie's last album as an aspirant, just before he found fame with Ziggy Stardust. It's a fascinating work on many levels that display lyrical depth, vivid imagery, wit and great musical variety, from the music hall pop of Changes through the sixties pop of Oh You Pretty Things to the cinematic lyricism of Life On Mars, a soaring masterpiece. Another of my favorites is Fill Your Heart, a quirky number with his somersaulting voice over lively piano and cheeky sax. Elements of the folkie singer/songwriter are evident on numbers like Song For Bob Dylan while The Supermen reminds me of his later science fiction work like [[ASIN:B0001RVUW4 Diamond Dogs]]. Bowie also salutes [[ASIN:B000026A1H Lou Reed]] and Andy Warhol here, in fact the whole album makes references to his musical influences. Hunky Dory is a bridge between his earlier music hall style and the glamrock that was to follow, and this was just the right mixture of catchy tunes & brilliant lyrics to ensure a timeless classic.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World At War is one of the best documentaries I have seen about World War II. I recommend anyone to watch it that is intersted in this war and Hitler's reign.
B00001OH7V|5.0|This 2nd synth album follows the pattern of Low, the first one in the [[ASIN:B000E5N634 Eno]] trilogy, in its mix of short pop/rock songs plus moody instrumentals and semi-instrumentals. Somehow it lacks the trenchant edge of Low although the title track is truly spectacular in its powerful imagery and stirring melody - his voice sounds as human as on Word On A Wing (from [[ASIN:B0000009NO Station to Station]]) over the wailing drone of the synths as it paints a scenario of lovers meeting beneath the Berlin wall. Truly breathtaking, this song was also released as a single in German and French versions in the 1970s. The melancholy Sons of the Silent Age has a spacey feel, beautiful lyrics and a ghostly chorus, while Blackout is harsh and discordant. I love the sax and the driving beat of V2 Schneider and Bowie's voice intoning the title. Moss Garden is a delicate instrumental, a sound I recognized later in some pieces by e.g. [[ASIN:B000003RHB Autechre]] and [[ASIN:B000000I1A Cabaret Voltaire]], but the sung Secret Life Of Arabia drags a bit. Owing to it's spectacular title track, Heroes remains my favorite of Bowie's trilogy of 70s synth albums.
B000NQR7R0|5.0|I usually listen to music on random play, shuffling through 6 CD's in a carousel CD player.  Not this one!  I love it so much, it always stands alone, sometimes on the repeat mode for consecutive multiple listens. After seeing \\"Kill Bill\\", I fell in love with the soundtrack, but had no idea this CD existed until recently.  Every track is outstanding, the arrangements are lush, the recording quality is excellent, and the musicianship is off the chain.  This CD never fails to put a smile on my face and a song in my heart.  Please, Robert Rodriguez, MORE of Chingon!  MORE MORE MORE!
B000LZ52YS|3.0|This is my least favorite of Bowie's trilogy of albums produced by Brian Eno. It lacks the innovation and freshness of [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]], and there are no truly spectacular songs like the title track from [[ASIN:B0000009NQ Heroes]]. Perhaps also I find the music somewhat clinical and devoid of emotion, but my impressions of this album is very fragmentary. While not bland, the musical textures and moods are aloof and have an unfinished feel about them. To me, Boys Keep Swinging and Fantastic Voyage are the only memorable songs and 'Boys' had a fantastic video clip. The song DJ comments on the disco era in a set of vivid images and the various experiments in rhythm are noteworthy. Three stars for its obvious intelligence but my personal enjoyment of it is limited.
031606792X|5.0|\\"Breaking Dawn\\" has been getting a lot of mixed reviews, so I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it. I'm not even going to begin summarizing the plot here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so here is the bottom line: I freakin' LOVED this book! It's completely different from the first three books in the series, and in my opinion, it's the best book by far. Yes, the events that unfold are a little bit odd, to say the least, but we're dealing with vampires and werewolves here, so it's foolish to expect anything normal. I still maintain that Stephenie Meyer isn't the world's greatest writer, and there are definitely some weak spots in the book (the ridiculously long section narrated by Jacob, which contains way too much annoying wolf banter, is one thing that instantly comes to mind). However, you have to give Meyer credit for originality. I had a feeling that there were three ways Edward and Bella's story could end, but I was wrong about every one of them. Instead of taking the easy way out, Meyer created an amazing story that's completely unpredictable and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, eagerly anticipating the twists and turns that would unravel on every page. I was thoroughly satisfied with this book, and I look forward to reading Meyer's future work.
B000NA287A|4.0|Scary Monsters marked Bowie's return in the early 1980s to a full-bodied rock sound, heavy with guitar and feedback, after the electronic experimentation of the 1970s in albums like Heroes, Low and Lodger. The catchy and tuneful Ashes To Ashes revisits Major Tom of [[ASIN:B00001OH7M Space Oddity]] while the funky Fashion with its striking vocals and danceable beat is in a way a rock treatment of a theme from the [[ASIN:B000MM0L4Q Young Americans]] `plastic soul' album of the 1970s. It is a perennial club classic. Other great tracks include Up The Hill Backwards, Scream Like A Baby and the cover of [[ASIN:B0000AQVEE Tom Verlaine's]] Kingdom Come. The sound is nearly as heavy as on The Man Who Sold The World but with a calculated rawness plus all the developments of the 1970s to create a very 80s hard rock effect. Scary Monsters is definitely more accessible to the average rock fan than any of his Eno albums that went before, and qualitatively better than most of his 1980s work that followed it.
031606792X|5.0|I absolutely loved all books! Each one with its own confrontations and blissfulness.    SPOILERS:  When Bella turns into a vampire, she sees that the only true love she had in her heart was Edward. The message behind that, from my point of view, was that us humans can become so confused with our emotions, not always knowing how to separate each one of them into their respected place. When she becomes a vampire, she points out are weaknesses as humans and how she could acknowledge that and be as perfect on the outside as well as in the inside. How then she could understand Edward's intense and true, pure...\\"clean of our weaknesses\\" love for her. I absolutely loved that message. The Jacob matter made sense and was the best place for him in the story in my opinion.   I really enjoyed reading this series and i am so glad they are making movies out of them...that way i wont miss it so much!
0312427999|4.0|The Shock Doctrine answers many questions I have raised in recent years.  Naomi Klein creates a seamless narrative of the deliberate destruction of freedoms in countries all around the world, and lays the blame squarely on Milton Friedman and the Chicago School.  Though it is entirely possible that not every instance she describes can be directly attibuted to the abuses of Friedmanism - and I would have preferred even more documentation - the pattern is clear as she sets it out.<br /><br />This book is well written and well researched.  It has changed my thinking about the history of the United States, and it makes me wonder whether we (the U.S.) hasn't done as much if not more damage to our \\"friends\\" (including Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland, Russia, South Korea, and others) than the former Soviet Union did to its satellites.<br /><br />When did our government decide that only economic freedom was important, and that political freedom could be suppressed indefinitely?<br /><br />Before Milton Friedman it was the United Fruit Company and many other meddling U.S. corporations who changed history by manipulating U.S. foreign policy. Friedman found a way to make himself look like a hero (he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize) when he may rank right up there with a few infamous tyrants I might name.
B000MV8ZD6|5.0|When a family moves from New York City to a New England town where they found the perfect place to stay, however their young child has a psychic power that enables him to see a ghost that warns him of the terrible things that happened there once. Long ago, a mad scientist named Dr. Freudstein conducted horrific experiments on people as he murdered them in the basement and used them, now a curse brings him back to life as a ravenous murderous zombie that kills as he seeks new blood and more people to kill and experiment on with ghostly events happening.<br /><br />Ghastly, unique and stylish supernatural zombie/haunted house thriller from Lucio Fulci is one of his best movies yet. Sure it lacks coherence but this movie delivers dark atmosphere, great scares, gory sequences like the skull stabbing and Bat mutilation sequences, and a chilling music score. I love how this movie combines both the zombie and haunted house movie genres especially influence by HP Lovecraft into one movie thanks to the magic of Fulci whom also makes a cameo in this motion picture, this is one of my all time favorite scary movies ever and highly recommended for fans of the genres but not for the squeamish.<br /><br />This DVD is a re-issue of the Anchor Bay edition which has a great transfer and good sound with fine extras like an easter egg, TV Spot, Trailer, Bio of Fulci and poster-and-still gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"House (1986)\\", \\"The Others\\", \\"The Shining\\", \\"Re-Animator\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\", \\"City of the Living Dead\\", \\"Demons 1 & 2\\", \\"Evil Dead 1 & 2\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead (1978)\\", \\"Making Contact (a.k.a.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Which is why she gets results! You do level one for ten days or until youre ready to progress, then you move on to level 2 and then level 3 until you've done 30 days. When I bought this DVD i thought, \\"Blegh, only 20 minutes for a whole workout? That's not going to work.\\" I was wrong! Even after the first time I did level 1 I was sore for several days. And I work out on a regular basis, so it takes a lot to get me sore.  I'm about halfway through the program now and someone has already asked me, \\"Wow, you've ben doing lots of squats?\\"    So I guess my tush is improving. Level 2 is significantly harder than level 3, so progress carefully! I haven't made it to level 3 yet :)
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I see a lot of 1-star reviews out there that clearly missed the point of this entire film and it makes me laugh in their faces. Watch the extras after the you watch the movie if you are curious about how the film was shot and put together and how the actors were hired.    For those that say, Glen Hansard can't sing ... we'll he a professional musician and has a band - the director was actually band mates with him at one point.     The movie is not a love story in the sense that the two main characters will fall in love. The movie is more about a man who had his heart crushed and is trying to get back on his feet and find the motivation to get his musical career going and Marketa Irglova's character provides that motivation.    I loved the guerilla shooting of the film and that the actors had no previous acting experience, but were friends in real life at one point. Just a great film and worth seeing and buying ... unless you are a total moron - then you should probably stick to, \\"Shoot em up\\"
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I don't usually post reviews here on amazon but this set deserves an exception. I shopped very carefully to find the \\"best\\" of the complete sets (shelling out $80 requires some attention to detail). After reading various reviews and sampling every recording I could find, I purchased this set.    Before I begin, I should say I don't believe that any performance of classical music is \\"definitive.\\" There are good recordings and bad recordings, yes, but among the good ones, it is often difficult to decide which is the \\"best.\\" I usually aim for an excellent sound coupled with a solid and moving interpretation of the work. For Mozart's piano concertos, there are several sets which contain both, with the individual recordings varying in the finer things.    For this particular performance, Perahia is all about tone, and keeping it perfect. Some may criticize this set for sounding \\"all the same\\" or lacking in variation, but this does not bore me or present much of a problem. When its played as beautifully as this one can never have too much. Still, if you are looking for a little more interpretation to \\"jazz up\\" the recordings, Brendel's set may be for you. I prefer this less romantic venture which focuses solely on the music. When I listen to one of these concertos I don't feel that I hear Murray Perahia playing, because he doesn't embellish or add anything. He just makes the music sing beautifully, and though I never like seeing the words \\"this is how the composer would have played it\\" (especially on Chopin reviews) I often feel that I'm hearing Mozart himself joyously run along the keys while conducting the instrumentalists.    The English Chamber Orchestra, which has performed this work with several other prominent pianists, sounds flawless and dances beautifully alongside Perahia's sweeping fingers. I cannot stress enough how clear this sound quality is: I've grown accustomed to muffled or muted piano sounds from various other cds and so was very pleased to hear this recording sound as great as it does. The playing is lighthearted and quick: some have expressed that it is a little boring but as I said above: lack of variation does not mean lack of excitement or interest.    A word for those who may be considering purchasing a much cheaper 2-disc set containing only the \\"major\\" concertos: the lesser known ones are just as good as the later ones! I found the first four concertos to be so melodic I spent a week listening to only them! There is certainly something to be said when listening to a piece of music for the first time, and this set gives you the opportunity to do just that and go far beyond the 6 or 7 that are heard everyday.    All in all, a purchase I am very glad I made, and one that continues to be listened to. A worthy purchase for anyone looking for a clear recording of Mozart's concertos performed in a very solid and classical way.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|This album was released in 1978 and is their best album with David Lee Roth. The opening song is Runnin with the devil, which is in my opinion has the best backup vocals from eddie and michael, the 2nd song is Eruption, there are no vocals, just an amazing guitar solo from Eddie, the 3rd song is originally sung by roy orbison, which is called oh pretty woman. The song Jamies cryin is a great song to, but alex van halen said that is his least favorite song in the entire song catalog
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Very cute story and great for kids! If you are an animal lover, this is the movie for you!
B00008BXJJ|5.0|Get this album, this is their 2nd live album and first with brian johnson. Brian is very good live. He even does a better job than bon scott. Brian is much better at singing Highway to hell. You can also consider it as a greatest hit album, a lot of their singles are on here but they are live. Also, to let you know this is a double cd, they have 2 different sets. A double which is this one and they have a standard one set cd
0393324818|5.0|I found this book fascinating.  I had read Michael Lewis' earlier book \\"Liar's Poker\\", about his dealings on Wall Street.  What struck me most was how he brought his free-market capitalism frame of reference to the world of Major League Baseball and found that for a small group avant-garde managers, the same basic rules apply.  Buy low, sell high, don't listen to market hype, and never get emotional.  This book might be disturbing to people who have a lifetime love of the pure game, but Major League Baseball is also a business and has to be acknowledged as such.
B000002L99|4.0|This is the first VH record with sammy on vocals. This is their biggest selling album with sammy as the singer. It went 6x platnium. They did changer their soung quite a bit. Love walks in and dreams and why cant this be love, which all are hit singles is a departure from the usually rock sound of diamond dave, but they do have a good rockin tune Summer Nights
0143038583|4.0|A very interesting book which fairly considers, defends and challenges all eating habits from vegans to junk-food junkies.  Micheal Pollan does an excellent job of tracking down the history of food laws & policies in the U.S. and revealing how that history impacts our national eating habits today.  Most of all I liked the ending, which wasn't doom and gloom but rather a positive recounting of the author's own completley home-made meal.  He seemed to really challenge himself, and ultimately enjoy himself, while writing this book.
B000002BFZ|4.0|This is their last album to debut at no.1. There are only 3 rock tunes on here, Hail'Hail, Habit and Lukin. Lukin is only  a minute long to let you know. Their first single is called Who You Are, which has eastern influence sound on it. The song I'm Open, eddie first talks, then he just says I'm Open a few more times, and the rest is nothing like their first two albums. This is the album where most of the pearl jam fans dont like, I think it is a very good record. It shows that pearl jam as a band can do more than just rock anthems
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better !!!   The 4th series is nothing short of excellent !!!   Charismatic David Tennant has really settled into the role comfortably by this his third series.   Catherine Tate, companion Donna is re-introduced as a regular this series as does Martha makes a welcome return for the Sontaran story but many fans have been eagerly awaiting the return of a new and tougher Rose Tyler.   Plus it boasts the return of Davros & the Sontarans, also the Daleks & the Ood,and a mysterious woman from Doctor Who's own personal future,alas the rumour mill is running wild on the internet but I am patient to just enjoy the final outcome on DVD as I have little choice but to wait as I live in Japan.     I don't wanna bore you so I will try to give you a brief outline of the episodes recently screened in Great Britain including the Xmas Cracker;     1 - Voyage of the Damned (2007 Xmas Special with Kylie & the Titanic in Space)   2 - Partners In Crime (reunites Donna & the Doctor, Sarah Lancashire leads a fatty invasion in modern day London)   3 - The Fires of Pompeii (The Doctor tries to stop a crazy alien cult from creating more chaos in Pompeii on the eve of its destruction)   4 - Planet of the Ood (We visit the Ood in the 42nd Century and find out what slavery and rebellion is all about)   5 - The Sontaran Stratagem (Martha recalls the Doctor back to Earth to help stop an invasion based at Rattigan Academy)   6 - The Poison Sky (The second part of the Sontaran invasion as they hope to re-create the earth as a power base for their clones)   7 - The Doctor's Daughter (Starring 'ironically' Peter Davison's daughter Georgia Moffet on a war-torn planet as 2 factions fight it out)   8 - The Unicorn and the Wasp (The story of famous writer Agatha Christie's missing 10 days)   9 - Silence in the Library (Another 2-parter introducing a woman from Dr Who's future and for Donna a phantasmic love story or is it?)   10 - Forest of the Dead (Killer shadows,a million million lifeforms and silence in the library)   11 - Midnight (A hostile Alien gains entry to a shuttlecraft thats broken down en route to a sapphire waterfall with the Doctor trapped on board with a bunch of paranoid half wits)   12 - Turn Left (A meaty role for Donna set on an alternative reality where she never met the Doctor and everything takes a turn for the worse)   13 - The Stolen Earth (Guest starring just about everybody from the previous 3 series - the Doctor and Donna,with Sarah Jane,Rose,Martha,Torchword are Earth's mighty heroes and are challenged by the new Dalek Empire and also guest starring whats gotta be the BBC's worst kept secret in Dr Who history,the return of the 'nasty' Davros).   14 - Journeys End (All loose ends are tied up in this magnificent episode which whizzes thru actionco. spectacularly for an hr leaving you tearful and a little disappointed at its conclusion).     So thats the end of another whizz bang fantastic series,next up are the return of the Cybermen in the X-mas 2008 special so lots to look forward too with a new Producer taking over the reins of Doctor Who.   But it doesn't matter, this is a great series well crafted with carefully thought out plots and not let down by an excellent cast and guest stars.   This DVD boxset would make an fantastic Christmas present and is on my X-mas wishlist plus to make sure I've also put it on everyone else's wishlist so someone's gotta buy it for me PLEASE :)     The Extras are fantastic,its loaded with extras,lots of extras only...I dont know what the hell they are except that you can pretty much guess what they'll be,there'll be the eXcellent CHILDREN IN NEED special with Peter Davison (or is it Peter 'Davidson' as Amazon UK so love incorrectly spelling it) and all the Series 4 Doctor Who confidentials seen on BBC Tv only extended I feel sure so well worth the wait and the money once the price goes down.     Doctor Who, after 45 years has finally fused the whopping great void betweenScience Fiction and Drama, small wonder its been firmly established as the BBC's flagship TV Show finally giving Doctor Who the respect it deserves after many many years in the wilderness.   Regardless of what many 'fans' say I think Russell Davies has done an excellent job as producer on Doctor Who and we should thank him for his drive and vision in getting the damn show back on the air after so long being without it and lets not spoil it by treating the man like a pariah like so many 'fans' did with John Nathan Turner 20 years ago, lets just be thankful Dr Who is back and not only that its the Number 1 SF/Drama in England if not the World, or indeed the 'Universe' as the Doctor himself would say.   The End...for now....
B000HT386M|5.0|This is Adam Sandler's best movie yet. In this one he is a overworked archtiect who is always trying to please his boss David Hassellholf and spending time with his family. His wife is played by Kate Beckinsale and his parents are played by the guy who played fonnzy on Happy Days and his mom is the person who does the voice of marge simpson. It has it share of funny moments and it's very touching moments. From that point on, he meets Christopher Walkin, who gives him a universal remote control that controls the universe. It can do anyting, he can mute his dog and anybody who talks. He can change the language the people speak, he can go back and look at old memories, he can also skip to the future, like if he didnt want to take a shower, he would fast-foward. But the bad part happens when he fast fowards to his promotion, his promotion didn't come untill a year later, and since he did that, the remote automatically skips all showers, all the times he has sex with his wife and it skips him to his next promotion which is another ten years he skips and then comes the more sad stuff.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The major dynamic of Doctor Who has always been one of change, after all it IS a show about a 900+ year-old face-swapping, regenerating Timelord with no-fixed-abode, each week an entirely new location, with a new cast of characters. It's because of this dynamic that the series has had such (multimedia) longevity. With series 4, of the new series we see a continuation of this, with the return of Donna Noble from the Christmas Invasion Special of 2006. But, this isn't the same Donna, she herself has changed as a character for having adventured with the Doctor, although she still, thankfully, is not as in awe of the Doctor as Rose in series 1, or in love as Rose in series 2, or struck love-sick with the unobtainable man as Martha in series 3. Donna has a unique perspective on the Doctor and his universe, almost seeing herself as an equal, if unsure of her abilities, but not so completely trusting of the Doctor. As Rose grew into the role of companion, so does Donna, but her journey isn't as simple, she may be the everyman companion (like Sally Sparrow or the men of LINDA). The show's overall perspective has changed, Rose and Martha held the point of view, unraveling the mysteries (for the viewer) of the Doctor and his world, especially with the angry and enigmatic Chris E's 9th Doctor. But now with David Tennant's 10th Doctor the audience knows more about the \\"last of the Timelords\\" than any companion, we don't need the companion as an anchor, thus we has Donna on an even playing field, and an excuse to bring back Martha (also changed for her travels)...an maybe Rose?<br /><br />This season the series has no major catchwords like \\"BAD WOLF\\" or \\"TORCHWOOD\\" and who can forget \\"MR. SAXON.\\" Season 4 is bound by other elements, a person, phrase, a prophetic statement/question, a place, building up, so pay attention. These elements aren't clues from this season alone, but references planted going as far back as the first season, or a recently as quotes from the Master in last season's finale, remember \\"The Crucible,\\" \\"Medusa Cascade\\" or the \\"Shadow Proclaimation?\\"<br /><br />What else this season has is loads of great stories from award-winning writers and loads of great performances from award-winning celebrity cameos: Nigel Terry (Excalibur), kylie Minogue, Felicity Kendal, Alex Kingston (ER), Colin Salmon (MI6), Christopher Ryan (the Young Ones), Geoffrey Palmer, Georgia Moffett (the Last Detective) and more. Of course, there are loads of great performances from the series regulars. David Tennant ads so much depth to what was a relatively static character, in the series original successful run. His Doctor still enabling the everyman to act, to be a hero. Along with Catherine Tate, their sense of pathos and comedic timing are nothing short of A-list quality.<br /><br />DVD set includes:(mild spoilers follow...)<br /><br />Time Crash: a fully finished short for the \\"Children in Need\\" UK charity featuring the 5th Doctor (Peter Davison) meeting the 10th Doctor, written by Steven Moffat.This is a direct precursor to the 2007 Christmas Special, in fact it really occurs a few minutes before the final seconds of Season 3's finale.<br /><br />\\"The Voyage of the Damned\\" or the 2007 Christmas Special. Now a Christmas Day tradition, since the 10th Doctor, newly regenerated came to our screens, this is the 3rd such special. This special is very derivative of the action film genre, more so that the previous specials, or Doctor Who as a whole. Moments very-like the Die Hard of your choice appear throughout \\"Voyage\\" while Tennant's Doctor is somewhat muted early on here. The Doctor this time out is rescuing the passengers and crew of the Starship TITANIC, a intergalactic cruise liner visiting scenic Earth, where disaster ensues and the Doctor's promises of salvation to the nicely eclectic gallery of survivors proves to be to much to handle. The Sweet, but over-rated and inappropriately aged Kylie Minogue as Astrid, a temp companion who dreams of seeing the galaxy, help the Doctor to resolve the sinister corporate machinations of Max Capricorn, at an extreme cost. Some elements are the angelic robo-baddies, homage to \\"the Robots of Death\\" and another classic iconic juxtaposition of holiday imagery.<br /><br />The first of the real season is \\"Partners in Crime\\" in which we rejoin Donna Noble from the Runaway Bride special and for an opening night episode, it still feel like on of the specials. It is fun, face-paced and over-the-top, it too has some Die Hard moments. Since turning down the Doctor's initial offer to travel, she has changed her mind and been investigating on her own hoping to one day run into the Doctor, and so she does. She also runs into CEO, Miss Foster who offers an unsuspecting public new way to lose weight with a sinister secret, well sinister may be to harsh a word, but let's just say that the fat \\"just walks away.\\" This one, is a bit of fun fluff, but the episode closer offers quite a twist.<br /><br />The second of the season is \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" or should I say \\"Volcano Day.\\" Filmed in Rome on the massive set from the HBO/BBC sets and other Mediterranean locales, we see some of the hard historical choices the Doctor must make, a choice I though he would have faced on the real Titanic, had it not been a Starship. In a fixed point in history...Who lives and who dies in the eruption of Vesuvius? This one has got it all, molten rock monsters, togas and Donna pleading for the Doctor to save someone. From the opening to the ending of this one Donna is asking so great and obvious questions (for example, if the TARDIS translates English to Latin & Latin to English, what happens when you speak Latin?).<br /><br />The third episode \\"Planet of the OOD\\" resolves the plight of the subservient, tentacle-mouthed slaves from The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit of 2006. The Doctor didn't really do right by them the last time around, but in his defense he was busy fighting the Devil. The OOD are both creepy and sympathetic simultaneously. This time the OOD are more than just tools, and yet again we have the motif of an evil CEO who needs comeuppance (3 of 4).<br /><br />The fourth and fifth episodes \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\" and \\"Poison Sky\\" obviously see the return of the potato-headed clone soldiers (pre-dating Lucas' clone troopers from \\"the Time Warrior\\"). This 2 parter also sees the return of UNIT and Dr. Martha Jones and if you missed her episodes of Torchwood series 2, she is a more confident, bolder character than when she and the Doctor parted ways. This one has another evil corporation and evil SAT-NAVs. These two are great \\"old school\\" episodes, Christopher Ryan brilliantly plays Sontaran General Staal. Watch the TARDIS monitor for another clue to the season finale.<br /><br />The sixth episode title was kept secret until the week before broadcast, \\"the Doctor's Daughter.\\" This is a really nicely done story, with some great casting<br />Including Nigel Terry (King Arthur from Excalibur) and Georgia Moffett (who is really the Doctor's daughter, 5th Doctor Peter Davison's real kid, who was nearly cast as Rose for 2005). Penned by Stephen Greenhorn, who wrote last season Lazarus Experiment, setting out to write a story that forever leaves the central character changed by the end.<br /><br />The seventh episode, the Wasp and the Unicorn, is the latest from writer Gareth Roberts, the \\"historical cameo\\" king. Having written Charles Dickens & Christmas Ghosts, Queen Victoria meeting a werewolf and Shakespeare with Witches, who better to write a manor house mystery with Agatha Christie?<br />Done with spinning newspaper, flashbacks and a body in the study, this one is a really Doctor-Who-dunnit (sorry). It has lots of cameos, some Dr. Who vets and David Tennant's DAD as the BUTLER!<br /><br />The long awaited 2-parter from writer 2 time HUGO-award winner Steven Moffat (Blink, Empty Child), \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"the Forest of the Dead\\" has awards written all over it. The shadows themselves are the enemy on a planet-sized Library and who is the mysterious archeologist River Song, who seems to intimately familiar with the Doctor, could she be Mrs. The Doctor? ...Anyway, if you read any of the New Adventures (of Doctor Who) in the 90's the spirit of this story will seem a very familiar homage (Google Prof. Benny Summerfield for more, irony here is her creator Paul Cornell didn't write an episode this season). River Song is played perfectly by the beautiful and talented Alex Kingston, adds to the increasing foreboding clues toward a bleak something on the horizon for Donna.<br /><br />Episode ten, \\"Midnight\\" while Donna relaxes poolside the Doctor goes on a 4 hour tour (you just can trust them). The Doctor and an unlikely tour group visit the surface of the \\"unihabited/unihabitable\\" planet of Midnight...but who's outside and who has gotten in? A great answer to the Voyage of the Damned in which a disaster brings out the best in mankind, here we see people turn on each other (and the Doctor) in fear, human nature at its ugliest. This \\"bottle\\" episode contained to the \\"space-truck's\\" cabin, is claustrophobic and although it contains no monster reveal it is one of the season's most frightening shows since the angels. Props to the sound crew/editors on this one, no visual effects make the sound all the more important! Also, after the 5th Doctor's real daughter, we this time get the 2nd Doctor's son David Troughton is onboard.<br /><br />Episode eleven \\"Turn Left\\" again by RTD himself leading us into the dark waters of the season four 3 part finale to come...hold on! This Doctor-light episode sees the special return of an companion and UNIT as things begin to get bad as a threat to more than just the Earth is revealed.<br /><br />Episode twelve, \\"The Stolen Earth\\" the Doctor's team prepare to battle the new ***** Empire, lead by *****.<br /><br />Final episode, concluding the tight 3 part story arc, \\"Journey's End\\"! Like last season, the season finale features the return of another major classic Dr. Who villain!<br /><br />Fear not, next season WILL have a Christmas special and 4 more specials to hold us over `til \\"delayed\\" season 5 airs. The specials will be the last produced by the remaining original 2005 team as Executive producer Julie Gardner and Phil Collinson has already left and Executive Producer Russell T. Davies will leave following the specials. Steven Moffat will take over for RTD. The full 5th season (2010) may be the time for 10th Doctor's own Journey to end, remember what I said about change, don't worry about that for now, just enjoy this amazing 14 episode DVD set.\\"e OOD are more than just tools, and yet again we have the motif of an evil CEO who needs comeuppance (3 of 4).

B000286S8S|4.0|This product right here is a two-disc set featuring both david lee roth and sammy hagar songs, none with gary cherone. In my mind, the first disc should be david lee roth songs, and the 2nd disc is sammy hagar. But instead one song is david and the next is sammy. It is by no means a crappy album. It just ruins it when i am listening to david lee roth singing Jump and then the next track comes and it's sammy singing. Also, I should say that there are three new tracks on this, Sammy, Eddie and Alex play on it but no michael anthony
B000W93CHC|3.0|Having never read Ken Follet before, I was looking forward to reading this book.  I have to say however, I was disappointed, it did not live up to what I perceived his writing to be.  I thought the story line was interesting enough and appreciated the historical perspective.  My main objection to the book is that Ken Follet's dialog was largely unbelievable, given the time period of the novel.  His characters seemed to be thinking and verbalizing in more current day vocabulary and jargon.  This detracted from the book.  While I did finish the book, afterall, I bought it for my Kindle, I would be reluctant to purchase another of his books.
B0016AJU2C|1.0|Having been a huge fan of her early music, I am deeply disappointed and saddened with her latest release. She seems to have surrendered to mainstream pop music, with far too many superficial influences in her new 'music'. Though angst can and does evolve and people grow and mature with time and their music will reflect their evolution, it is far different from 'changing' to be something her soul clearly does not reflect.I have always loved her rawness, her insightful lyrics, her basic instruments, WITHOUT the synthesizers and club sounding beats she has now embraced. Seeing her in interviews since this release, she even seems disconnected from who she is at her core. While she is expressing her grievance over her break-up with Ryan Reynolds, and I thoroughly embrace her expression of those feelings on a CD, I would have been much more embracing of a CD that allowed her to stay true to herself. She is either being misguided by the misconception that bigger & more is better, or she has become next in the line of pop culture sell outs. I tend to believe she is much too intelligent to be a sell out. Sometimes just simple and true and real is the absolute best. At least for Alanis. This is one CD I will not bother with because it doesn't feel like a real, Alanis Morrisette gift from the hippie chick who did not perform from her ego but from her gut & soul, a beautiful spirit with the magical ability to engage listeners because she was true to herself and that is what made her shine. May she find her way back to her core next time around. I give this 1 star, because her voice is still as beautiful as ever.
0767836324|5.0|As of this writing, I am 22 years old.  When this hit theaters, I was but a small child.  I saw it in theaters, bought the VHS the day it came out and DVD the day it came out.  Through seeing hundreds and hundreds of movies, this movie tops my list as my favorite movie of all time.  Of course, I'm a huge Peter Pan fan and Steven Spielberg, but it is a great movie.  Everyone always wanted to know WHAT IF Peter Pan grew up.  Underlying theme of the movie is no matter how old you get, age doesn't change how you think or how you act.  I can't go on enough on how good this movie is, just watch it and love it.  The music of the movie makes me cry, it's so good!!!!
031606792X|2.0|Whoa!  Like so many others, I was a little disappointed with this last installment.  When I first learned that about 1/3 of the book was from Jacob's perspective, I almost didn't want to start it.  Jacob was a real jerk in book 3.  I couldn't wait to read about the wedding (I am female, after all), and I wanted to see what possible conflict could come.  My biggest complaint of all is that there was so much WAITING for the Volturi.  The pain, the stress, the agony of waiting dragged on and on.  And then, poof!  All gone!  I have heard some complain that the denouement was too short.  I don't think so unless you consider the balance between the waiting and the ending.    As to Stephenie diluting her messages...  Call me old-fashioned if you will, but I still believe that a woman's greatest role is that of wife and mother.  I am NOT saying she shouldn't be educated (I am) or that she should NOT wait until she is mature to wed (I was) and have children.  But at the end of a woman's life (I know, she is immortal, but we're not!), she will not ponder her great business conquests or her wonderful social climbing.  She will think of her children and her family.    I did find it refreshing that they waited until the wedding night, which is so rare in modern fiction.  I found some of the descriptions surrounding intimate scenes a little racy for teens.  I don't want my daughters reading it at 17!    This did tie up just a little too neatly.  I didn't mind the imprinting so much--I think she did a good job at preparing us for that with Quil and Claire's relationship.  It is a little creepy, but I was happy for Jacob that he imprinted somewhere.  I am glad there were happy endings for everyone except Irina's family, but I think there may be been a different way to get it.    I'm glad I borrowed these books and didn't buy them.  I don't know if I'll ever read them again.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|i have been a fan of the jonas brothers since 2005. nick jonas is my favorite i love him. there newest album rocks. my favorite songs are a little bit longer and burnin up. i really like a little bit longer because i have low blood sugar and other things so this songs mean alot to me. nick if your reading this thank you your my hero and i love you.p.s. iam a year older than you but i still love you god bless you nick jonas and the jonas family. so anyways i give this album a 10 star.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult has done it again.  Her poignant novel about a school shooting and the incessant school bullying is worth reading and sharing.  Unless you've been involved with public schools, you are probably unaware of the bullying that is ever present.  The author does an excellent job of exploring the problem and developing the characters involved.  Every teacher and parent needs to read this!
B001AW9DKK|4.0|Neil Young, appalled and angered by the actions of the Bush Crime Family, put out the caustic and accusatory CD, \\"Living with War,\\" a couple of years ago. It was a blistering indictment of the Iraq War and the crimes and misdemeanors perpetrated by the current administrtion. He quickly realized that the material on \\"Living with War\\" would lend itself beautifully to sounds and philosophy of his old bandmates in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young -- the ultimate troubadours.    CSN&Y cut their teeth as social protestors with their music from the '60s and '70s. Songs like \\"Ohio,\\" \\"Wooden Ships,\\" \\"Chicago,\\" \\"For What it's Worth,\\" and \\"Find the Cost of Freedom,\\" galvanized a generation and helped expeidate Nixon's departure from the White House. Many of those songs are indeed included here, next to Young's latest anti-war rants.    I'm not sure that protest music has the same power it once had. In fact, some people were angry and confused with CSN&Y's \\"Freedom of Speech\\" tour, reacting the same way the Dixie Chick's redneck-fan base did when that group spoke out against the Bush Insanity. All I can think of to explain that is that these people weren't actual CSN&Y fans and had only come to the shows to hear them play \\"Our House\\" for 90 minutes.    Most of the \\"Living with War\\" tunes are reimagined here. Especially fun is the boys' version of \\"Let's Impeach the President,\\" which benefits from the four-part harmony and crisper production values than found on the studio album. Old protest chestnuts are included, such as Nash's \\"Military Madness\\" and Crosby's \\"Who Are The People?\\"    The album is fun, cool, historical, well-performed and well-produced. Better yet, it will raise the blood pressure of every mouth-breathing neo-con from Tallahassee to Telluride. The sad part is that they had to do it all.
B0017MO10U|3.0|I'v been a Fan since the Movie and been watching the series since the first episode. This Movie should have been a two part episode on TV thoughe instead of a \\"Movie\\" the acting espesially by Col Oniel was very \\"one line rehersal so to speak\\" it seemed cheap. I was looking soooo forward to this movie and was disapointed. I own the entire series as well as there Sister series \\"Atlantis\\" and this will be the first part of it that I just wont buy. But in all it's worth watching just rent it rather than buy it.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|Now I know what you're thinking? The Jonas Brothers having a five star review? Before you accuse me of being some teenybopper with no taste in music let me reveal my musical tastes. I love the Beatles, Springsteen, Elvis etc, so I know what great music is. When making this review I will no be pitting the Jonas Brothers up against the Beatles because it is impossible. However, I will be reviewing their album in terms of the pop/rock teen genre and I have to say it is awesome.     Let me break down the tracks:    1. BB Good 9/10. I love this song. This is the pefect way to open the album. The guitars on this track are amazing and it's a pefect sing in the car kind of song. Joe truly proves why he is the frontman of the band with the charisma he displays in this track. Pure fun.     2. Burning Up 8/10. Great song, but I heard it a little too much, but that still doesn't take away from the track.     3. Shelf 8/10. A more mature song with great guitar vocals and lyrics.     4. One Man Show 5/10. Not my favorite. One of the weakest on the album.     5. Lovebug 10/10. My absolute favorite song on the album. It is such a unique song and a refereshing change from their usual sound. Though the talking might seem a little strange at first, once you listen to the track enough it becomes fun and you understand why it is there.     6. Tonight 8/10. A fun song to listen to.     7. Can't Have you 9/10. The first real ballad with more marture lyrics and volcals.    8. Video Girl 10/10. I love this song because it pokes fun at Hollywood. From the opening to the song and the lyrics that follow, it is the Jonas Brothers like you've never seen them before, making fun of the world around them. Must listen.     9. Pushin Me Away 8/10. The music is great but the lyrics are a bit repetitive.     10. Sorry 10/10. Amazing volcals and emotion on this track. One of my favorites.     11. Got me Going Crazy 7/10. A fun but throw awya track.     12. A Little Bit Longer 10/10. A great way to closethe album and shows that the band is capable of writing great songs and pulling at the heartstrings of the audience. Really listen to the lyrics on this one.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Nearly a quarter of the reviews at this juncture rate Napoleon Dynamite as one star or, if possible, lower. As if to emphasize their displeasure, plenty of these reviewers attempt to educate those of us who do like this movie why we are foolish to like it, why it is such a colossal waste of time, why it is so boring, why it is not funny, etc., etc., etc. I am touched and flattered that you have come down from on high to offer your help in curing me of my poor taste. I can't thank you enough. Please order me a strong cocktail of Woody Allen movies and let me view them non-stop until I see the light of your comedic wisdom. Bless you, kind souls, bless you.<br />For the rest of you out there who just don't get it, who can't stop enjoying this movie, who find it funny, charming, and quotable to the extreme, who would rather watch this for the twentieth time than attempt to sit through Woody Allen's tired offerings, I raise my glass of bleach-tainted milk to you. May your nun-chucks always fit in your locker, may your tots never get squashed, may your hair never get hot, and may you relax in peace in the hot tub with your soul mate forever. Peace out.
0972169504|5.0|This is a great book. His humour is so spot on - it really is a great representation of grad life. This first book also shows how the strip has progressed over time - the artwork and the story arcs have developed a lot.     A comic book that is extremely cathartic - and yeah, It really did help me get through my PhD.
B00000AOUD|5.0|'Thick as a Brick' is Tull's 'intentional' concept album, telling the tale of Gerald (Little Milton) Bostock.  Putting the lyrical content aside for a moment, the album is prog rock excellence, with the organ, synth and guitar taking the forefront of the music.  Ian Anderson's vocals are outstanding as can be expected from this time period in the long career of Tull.  Both part 1 and 2 of TAAB really shine, although for a strange reason the cd manufacturer decided to keep the break between sides 1 and 2 of the original LP.  The live version is much shorter, just hitting the highlights and comes off rather well.  The interview with Ian Anderson, Martin Barre and Jeffrey Hammond, while interesting, probably could've been left off, unless you're interested in hearing the tale of the urine tainted rabbit costume head.  At any rate, for those who are building up their Tull collection this one, as it goes without saying, is essential, and is ranked highly for good reason.
031606792X|2.0|I was so looking forward to this book but I can only say I walked away disappointed. The story felt rushed, disjointed, and had 'everything but the kitchen sink' thrown in, idea-wise. It was almost as if the author had so many unfleshed-out ideas and she just wanted to toss them all in and be done with this story and the characters. (Maybe she was bored? Wanted to move on?)    I would have been happier thinking the third book was the last...
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Great shipping from Amazon, as always.  Of course, the Gilmore Girls are great.  A must have.
B0017VG69U|4.0|I recently picked up Season 2 remastered.  After the glowing reviews of others, and how much I liked the HD-DVD remastered release of season 1, I thought I couldn't go wrong.  Ok, I own the original DVD Season 2 release already, but being a big trekkie fan and never seeing the remastered shows of season 2 on broad cast, I picked it up. P.S. I'm no purist, and I love the new CGI space scenes.  (personally, I wish they had pushed it further).    Alright, well the picture quality for me in this set is no where near as good as Season 1 HD-DVD remastered.  I'm sure all of it is due to the difference in formats.  But,= still, for me it's a big drop off, and compared to many of other recently release DVD's , it doesn't really look as good.  I only really see a marginal difference between the original DVD season 2.  Further, the special features aren't any different that the original DVD set, and is the area I'm really disappointed.  I would have loved some sort of fan commentary track or critic track.  There is so much history to these episodes, added commentary tracks would have made it a must buy for me.    So bottom line, if you don't own the first Season 2 DVD's already, and want to see your star trek now...well I recommend.  But if your someone who really sees the different in HD over standard pictures and/or own the original DVD season 2 set, then just wait for the inevitable bluray version or for season two to completely come to xbox-live/i-tunes, where you can cherry pick the remastered eps you want.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I really liked the way this movie was presented.  It took alot of the horror out of the element and showed love and compassion in a 1000 times told story.  Pearl Harbour is history.  History can be embellished pretty easily, especially by Hollywood.  Not to worry, you won't feel like this movie was fake.  I think most people walk away seeing this time and time again.  Fact this is my second copy (I think I loaned amy other one out and never got it returned!)
031606792X|5.0|I took 4 days and read the whole series of books.  (I had no choice since once I got started, I couldn't put them down!)  I thought Breaking Dawn was a great way to end the saga (and even left it open to a continuation in the future if desired).<br /><br />I was thrilled to see she was pregnant!  Anyone who has had children knows and understands the love that is created there.  It is the only thing in her life that could distract her of her love of Edward.  Her feelings didn't change towards Edward, she just learned that there was something even stronger, something she never would have imagined but those who are parents, already understand while reading the book!<br /><br />I read some of the one star reviews and saw nothing but holes.  By reading them all in one big chunk I was able to see the preparation the previous books made to set up the last book.  I know the imprinting of Jacob to Bella & Edward's baby upset many, but when Jacob's friend did the same thing earlier in the saga, it already set that up.  Before I even started reading \\"Breaking Dawn\\" I had a hunch that was how it was going to go.  He of all people would be the best protecter of such a delicate being.  1. He already knew the secret. 2. He loved Renessme's Mom and had a growing respect for Edward.  4. He was strong enough and had resources to protect her better then anyone.  5. Having him imprint on her, he would take the best care of her and would die protecting her.  Also, the fact that she was growing so rapidly, Jacob only had to wait 6 years for her to grow.  I think it was a great way to extend the family!<br /><br />I was grateful there wasn't a gory battle, that would have been heartbreaking.  She wrote it in a way where you weren't quite sure what was going to happen, you could imagine the pain that would be felt if they were to start dying, but in the end, there was a sigh of relief.<br /><br />I was thrilled to be able to read a book that had sex after marriage, baby after marriage, full respect of a male towards a female, strong family ties, self sacrifice and such much more.  We live in a world where everything is backward and it was refreshing to get lost into a story where the priorities were in the proper order.s a female, strong family ties, self sacrifice and such much more.

Btu Scalzi manages to write so that his works are easy to read, engaging, humorous and serious, and most importantly, entertaining.<br /><br />Although theres a bit of gloss over some background, the science and theory behind everything is easy to follow, and though quite a bit of it is obviously made up, the technology he creates is original and well thought out. The plans and politics are also well explained, a serious shortfall of many, many sci-fi books and TV shows. Theres no Star-Trek throwaway gobbledigook to come up with the last minute solution. Every situation is described concisely, and to be blunt, a little blandly, which helps to crystallize how brilliant the plan was.<br /><br />The humor is what makes his work fantastic. Despite the dark overtones of the books, Scalzi manages to make you smile, if not laugh at some of the conversations and situations, and the Last Colony keeps up that trend magnificently.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|As far as just being a movie, this one isn't bad...much better than Saw 2 but nowhere near as good as the original.  As I mentioned in previous reviews, this franchise has a built-in limited shelf life.  There is only so much you can drag out a series like this.  The original Saw was a beautifully gruesome idea that was worked with a brilliant touch of morbid, sick class.  The second movie  was a cheap sequel that made no effort to disguise its cheap, shameless capitalistic quality of just living off the reputation of the original.  This third movie had an obvious influence by Saw originators L. Wannell and J. Wan.  Their writing and influence in this flick shows.  It is a fairly-well thought-out movie premise on its own.  But as I said, this series has its limits as far as how far you can stretch the idea before it becomes ridiculous.  Sure, all movies are fantasy.  They all ask you to believe what can not really happen in everyday life.  And the better movies can get away with asking for more \\"fantasy lenience\\" than others.  But in a franchise such as this, your limits are being tested before you get to Part 3.  Where does this Jigsaw guy get the resources to perform these grotesque acts on people???  On its own, this is a pretty decent gore movie.  I enjoyed it.  But they are really pushing it when they kidnap a doctor and ask her to conduct brain surgery on Jigsaw in some abandoned warehouse with power tools and aspirin.  The main theme is clever, in a disgusting, sick way.  But, we're reaching the point where continuing this franchise is beating a dead horse.  Where it is obvious that Wannell and Wan put some thought into this movie, the time has come to move on.  If you like that Saw series, this movie is way better than Saw 2, but it makes no effort to contend with the brilliance of the original Saw.  And just so you know, Saw 4 is good, but it's really time to stop!!!  I just heard that a Saw 5 is coming out in the fall.  All I can say is, the horse is deadalready!  Seriously, it's dead!!!  Stop beating the dead horse already!!!  This movie is worth watching, though...just don't watch it while you're eating dinner, especially if you're having ham or pork!
1400076943|5.0|I finally managed to get my hands on a library copy of Purple Hibiscus by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I'm glad I did, because it's a truly beautiful book.<br /><br />Fifteen-year-old Kambili lives in Nigeria with her parents and her older brother Jaja. Her father Eugene, a rich businessman and the owner of the only indipendent newspaper in the country, is considered a model of generosity and political courage. But he's also a fanatic Catholic and a tyrant at home, imposing a strict discipline over his family and lashing out cruel, violent punishment.<br /><br />But everything changes for Kambili and Jaja when they go to live with their aunt Ifeoma, a university professor with three kids. In the new house there is laughter, music, and the ability to discuss matters. Kambili and Jaja discover a new life of independence, love, and freedom. And this will change their future forever.<br /><br />I truly loved this book. Purple Hibiscus is a compelling story about the end of innocence, domestic violence, religious fanatism and the discovery of freedom, against the backdrop of an African country troubled by corruption and dictatorship.<br /><br />If you haven't read it yet, go and grab a copy!
B001B71NOI|3.0|Some good singles here, but the majority is kinda weak.  Not bad mind you, but just not the caliber I'd expect from Trent.  So-so album.<br /><br />I liked YEARZEROREMIXED a lot better.
031606792X|4.0|Bella: \\"Should I be afraid?\\"<br />  Edward: \\"Terrified.\\"<br /><br />I finally managed to finish Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer. It's a massive book--it resembles a brick, actually--and it took me the better part fo a week to get through it at top speed. In this review there will be no spoilers, as long as I can help myself--just my thoughts on the Twilight saga and its closure.<br /><br />I discovered the Twilight saga a year ago. Mostly I was curious and wanted to know what the hype was all about. I read Twilight and didn't think it was very much of a good book. Then I went on to read New Moon and discovered Jacob Black-the marvellous Jacob Black, my favourite character of the series--and I sort of got addicted. Eclipse was even better than New Moon: I was all set on Team Jacob, even though I knew perfectly well that it was never meant to be.<br /><br />The best thing about these books, seriously, is their beautiful book covers. Don't they appeal to you? The lush black cover with a single drawing on it. New Moon's cover was probably the most striking, with Breaking Dawn coming second.<br /><br />I know I should have issues with this series--about how Bella is always so helpless and in need to be saved, about how Edward is always so incredibly, annoyingly perfect. But the truth is, I don't really care. These books are fun and I like them. I don't love them the way I loved the HP series--not even remotely close--so this means I'm not that involved with the characters, not in the way the Twilight fandom seem to be.<br /><br />This might be the reason why I can't understand why a large part of the fandom is so angry at Stephenie Meyer for ending the sotry the way she did. I thought Breaking Dawn was a good book; not as good as Eclipse, but good nonetheless. Some plot twists felt a little crazy, but they have their own reasons to be, I suppose. Breaking Dawn brings the characters to new levels of maturity, and brings closure to the story with a big, fat happy ending. So why should the fans be upset? Please exlain it to me, because I don't really get it.<br /><br />To sum it up, I liked how Stephenie Meyer completed her Twilight saga. Of course, it you don't like to read how perfect Edward is and how many times he kisses Bella oh-so-perfectly, this might not be the book for you. But I bet you already knew that.ase exlain it to me, because I don't really get it.    To sum it up, I liked how Stephenie Meyer completed her Twilight saga.

B0017MO10U|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this movie.  And bringing Baal AND Apophis back was truly inspired.<br /><br />ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back.  Uhhh ... DUH!!  OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.<br /><br />The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.<br /><br />I saw NO such hints.  BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not.  I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise.
031606792X|5.0|I love this series, with the wonderful emotions and the great ride Stephenie takes us on.  The last book was creative and unexpected and seemed to be the perfect ending.  After I read BD, the story felt right,  like this was how it was suppost to be.  I loved the fact that Bella and Edward became true partners.  In Eclipse, I struggled with Bella and her dependence and almost one sided need of Edward.  This book made them equals.  I thought it was great.
B000000ZGO|5.0|It was with deep saddness that I heard of the passing of Composer,Arranger,Singer,Producer,Songwriter,DJ and humanitarian Mr.Isaac(Black Moses)Hayes a few days ago.Myself being being a big Isaac Hayes fan.And having just about everyone of his albums decided to review the 'Hot Buttered Soul' album.Because this is the album that startled it all and gave birth to the movement.The Isaac Hayes movement that would come to dominate the mid sixties and on into the mid seventies.Isaac Hayes had a uncanny way of taking other peoples songs and turning them into something very special and unique.And when Isaac Hayes decided to rap on some of his songs the raps were done with class and style.You found yourself actuality feeling the pain of the guy as he drove his car with tears in his eyes on his way to Phoenix.On 'Walk On By' Hayes gives us a fantastic arrangment and a great vocal performance.And if you like some funk in your music you got 'Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic'.And finally you have 'One Woman' a song dealing with forbidden love sung with deep depth of feeling by Hayes.'Hot Buttered Soul' with its mixture of horns,strings,vocals and storytelling turned out to be a powerhouse elixir of sound.We should also give some credit to Stax records for having the guts to put this album out to the public.I think the biggest influence 'Hot Buttered Soul' had on R&B is that it put an end to the three minute rule for R&B songs.Before 'Hot Buttered Soul' R&B songs were three minutes or less.After 'Hot Buttered Soul' artists like The Temptations,Barry White,Donna Summer,James Brown and Stevie Wonder  songs became longer.By breaking the three minute rule Isaac Hayes made it possible for these artists and so many others to extend their musical creativeness.After 'Hot Buttered Soul' Isaac Hayes and The Movement would give us the albums To Be Continued,The Isaac Hayes Movement,Black Moses,Live At The Sahara Tahoe and of course Shaft.With the great songs Our Day Will Come,I Stand Accused,Never Can Say Goodbye,Ain't No Sunshine and Theme From Shaft.This is just a small amount of music that came out of the fertile musical mind of Iassc Hayes.Well the fertile musical mind of Isaac Hayes is at rest now along with Curtis Mayfield,James Brown,Barry White and Luther Vandross.With only a few of the R&B giants left what the furture holds for R&B? I for one do not know.But I do know this.The music of Isaac Hayes will continue to be a source of entertainment and Joy(another one of his albums).Rest In Peace Brother Hayes.ed,Never Can Say Goodbye,Ain't No Sunshine and Theme From Shaft.This is just a small amount of music that came out of the fertile musical mind of Iassc Hayes.Well the fertile musical mind of Isaac Hayes is at rest now along with Curtis Mayfield,James Brown,Barry White and Luther Vandross.With only a few of the R&B giants left what the furture holds for R&B?

B000WCDI64|5.0|this is an amazing concert- yes, she is trouble, but oh so talented.  I saw this concert on Lufthansa in first class on my last month trip and loved it- even at 51 years old, I still like this music genre and I hope she cleans her act up and releases many more great CDs
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Excellent sound quality. I'm now hearing the more subtle things that we couldn't hear back in the 8-track days. I saw these guys many, many times in the early 70's just before they hit it big and this CD really brings those shows back to life.    If you're a ZZ fan you will love this version.
B00005NB8K|3.0|My sister is a major fan of this movie, but in all honesty I am not a big fan of The Doors and so seeing the movie was not a huge priority of mine.  After her incessant insisting I decided to give it a try though, and while I can't say that the experience was truly mind-blowing, I can say that I found some very entertaining moments in the film (especially when in regards to the acting).<br /><br />As a whole I don't think that Oliver Stone's `The Doors' works well as a biopic.  It never really gets inside the minds of its subjects.  Its focus is clearly on frontman Jim Morrison and so the rest of the band just gets really nothing more than a passing glance.  Honestly, I don't even remember hearing their names uttered in the film, which is not good for someone who is not familiar with the band since they won't be able to tell who is who.  Stone truly only cares about one thing, and that is immortalizing Morrison.  Thankfully he has Val Kilmer in the lead, and Val was utterly perfect as Morrison.  I wish that the script would have given Kilmer a little more to chew on, for then his performance could have proved to be iconic, but even with the little he is given he manages to sink deep inside Morrison and bring to life his uncanny draw.<br /><br />Stone is a very interesting director.  I don't think that I have yet to be completely enamored with any one of his films; they always seem to be a bit off for me (I have yet to see `JFK' though, and I hear that is his finest film).  He does a decent job of constructing this biopic, but in the end it feels a bit empty, as if we've really learnt nothing about this band, or even Morrison, aside from what he already has divulged to the known world.  We never really get an intimate look at what made this man tick.<br /><br />Stone does use some interesting techniques with this film that give the audience a feeling of being stoned almost, and I think that aspect of the film translates well with the given circumstances of the films focus, but those nice little tweaks are not enough to make up for the lackluster scripting.<br /><br />A biopic of this nature should have a little more meat.<br /><br />Regardless of what you feel about this film in general though, there is no denying that Val Kilmer delivers his career best performance, capturing the mannerisms and the massive appeal that was Jim Morrison.  He transcended the box Stone kept him in and made himself as real as he could to the audience.  At a mere glance his performance could come off as nothing more than imitation but there is an extra shimmer in his eyes that bleed through with a dedication that surpasses mimicry.  I was also very impressed with Meg Ryan, who plays Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson.  She has limited screen time but she manages to make her portrayal very honest and memorable.  Her final moments with Kilmer are heartbreaking in their honesty.<br /><br />`The Doors' is not the best biopic out there, but it has its moments and is enjoyable.  It feels rather vapid when all is said and done (somewhat like `The Notorious Betty Page', which I recently reviewed) but like `Betty', `The Doors' lives and dies with one tremendous performance, and Kilmer's performance keeps this passable film breathing.focus, but those nice little tweaks are not enough to make up for the lackluster scripting.<br /><br />A biopic of this nature should have a little more meat.<br /><br />Regardless of what you feel about this film in general though, there is no denying that Val Kilmer delivers his career best performance, capturing the mannerisms and the massive appeal that was Jim Morrison.

031606792X|3.0|On one hand, I can only agree with the reviewers who viewed Bella and her rush to immortality and marriage a questionable role model for young women.  However,to attribute too many deep contemporary insights and judgments on \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is somewhat unfair as the whole series seems to be more of a fantasy vs. serious fiction or social commentary.  That aside, it was a disappointing conclusion to an otherwise engaging series.  There were too many plots and sub plots for one book and Stephanie Meyers might have done better to consider 5 volumes or even better, stop with \\"Eclipse\\" and leave the rest to the imagination.  One also needs to wonder if the quality of the story and characters would have been better if she there had not been such a rush to publish again.
0790729644|5.0|It's really no wonder it's taken me this long to finally see `Unforgiven'.  I've stated before that westerns were never really my thing, and it's not like Eastwood has a huge draw on me either.  He's serviceable at best in my opinion, only on rare occasions having his overly gruff mannerisms pay off with brilliance.  After the amazing year westerns in general had last year (`3:10 to Yuma', `No Country for Old Men' and `...Jesse James...' all making my top ten of the year) I figured that maybe I should research this Oscar winning classic to see if the films iconic status was justified.<br /><br />Watching `Unforgiven' has really made me realize that you should never judge a film before you see it, because you never truly know what's in store for you.<br /><br />`Unforgiven' opens with a sharp pain of brutality as two men victimize a woman.  When the sheriff doesn't do anything more than slap the men's wrists the women of the community put out a reward for the men's head.  William Munny, a former murderer turned caring father and widower, hears of the reward and, hesitantly, decides to pursue it in order to better take care of his two children.  Along with his former sidekick Ned Logan and an overly confident young gunslinger going by the name of The Schofield Kid, Munny makes his way into town with his horse and his gun and the smell of blood.<br /><br />Eastwood really went all out with this production.  The overall feel of the film is very gritty and dark and adds weight to the moral that is brought to the full as the curtains close so-to-speak.  The film is violent, but in a repressed sort of way, allowing the majority of the film to ride on the anticipation of bloodshed and only truly rearing its head in short explosions of brutality.  This allows `Unforgiven' to become more than just an action film or a bloodbath but creates a film that is as deep and poignant as it is entertaining.<br /><br />The acting is also golden here.  Morgan Freeman seems to just coast through his scenes, but his companionship with Eastwood is unmatchable.  He just has such a natural talent that even when he isn't doing anything exceptional he is still amazing.  Clint has never really sold it for me.  I was impressed with him in `Million Dollar Baby' because I felt as though he made his harshness work to his advantage.  He does that here as well.  Next to `Million Dollar Baby' this has got to be his finest performance.  Gene Hackman steals the whole show though as Bill Daggett, the ruthless sheriff.  His savagery is embellished by his sick sense of justification and that makes Hackman's character development nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />In the end I'm pleased to say that `Unforgiven' stands up as worthy of the praise and attention it has received.  I can't say if it was the best film of the year (92 was such a fantastic year for film) but it most definitely ranks in my top ten and surely will stand the tests of time as one of the most effective westerns of all time, defining everything that makes the genre what it is.  I may not be an avid supporter of the genre as a whole, but when a western is done right it can be nothing short of amazing.  `Unforgiven' is done very, very right.panionship with Eastwood is unmatchable.

0307386171|1.0|I'm sorry but this story stank! It was far too rambling, considering how short it was. I skipped huge parts just to get to the end, only to find out they'd called it quits before the end of their wedding night? It also didn't ring true that they wouldn't have confided in each other it was their first time. I don't know, I'm not too keen to read more by this author based on this book.
B000GB775E|3.0|I, like many, figured that this film was going to be disastrous.  Lindsay Lohan has not really had a good track record as of late with her film choices.  The last time she made something that wasn't wholly cheesy was in 2004 when she made the brilliant `Mean Girls', and even then it was her co-star Rachel McAdams who stole every scene.  Since then though, Lindsay has kind of fallen into patterns of obscurity, making one bad teen flick after another.  Now, `Just My Luck' is not a complete departure from that mold (it's not like this is a `smart' comedy) but it does lose a lot of the childish overtones for some genuinely funny moments.<br /><br />The film follows Ashley Albright, a successful young woman who is unbelievably lucky.  Everything just seems to fall into line for her making her life a walk in the park.  Jake Hardin is her polar opposite.  Nothing he does turns out right.  He is inherently unlucky.  He works a dead end job at a bowling alley and tries fervently to get one of the local bands signed by a record label to no avail.<br /><br />That is all until one fateful masquerade ball when, after an unexpected kiss, Ashley and Jake find themselves swapping luck.<br /><br />Quickly things fall apart for Ashley.  She loses her job, she loses her apartment, she loses her mind.  On the other hand Jake is rising up fast.  The local bands demo tape falls into the right mans hands and Jake is instantly managing the band.  Then Jake meets Ashley (without the masks on) and the two form a friendship, neither knowing that the other is the one they kissed that fateful night (which is always ridiculous to me since it's not like those masks they wear in these movies really hides anything...I think Lindsay had on a cream colored veil).<br /><br />The film does pour on the `unlucky' bit a little too heavy in some scenes (NO ONE is that unfortunate) and the whole `passing of the unlucky survival backpack' was kind of (or really) lame, but for the most part `Just My Luck' hits its mark well.  Lindsay is charming and actually quite stunning here.  I don't think she's ever looked better.  Chris Pine is decent enough as Jake to make his whole transformation believable.  Missi Pyle always plays the same breed of train wreck, and she does it well so I can't knock her.  We're not looking for award winning performances, just entertaining ones, and that is precisely what we get here.<br /><br />Sure, `Just My Luck' is not a great comedy, but it is a good on and it proves to be Lohan's best film since `Mean Girls'.  She's proven she can carry a teen comedy like this, now it's time for her to branch out (much like her `Mean Girls' co-star McAdams) and prove that she can be taken seriously.<br /><br />That is if her mother will let her.charming and actually quite stunning here.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|Have you ever had a moment in your life where things have dramatically changed? And you didn't know how you were going to pick yourself up? Well I happened to catch this movie half way through when a relationship literally came to an end. This movie has to be one of the most heart mending movies I've ever seen. Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black are very enjoyable in this. It's so great to see Jack Black in a serious love interest role. If I had never seen this movie, I would've never believed he could pull this off. This movie will warm your heart no matter where you are in life.
B00005V9HH|3.0|I will say that `The Usual Suspects' is entertaining, because to say otherwise would be a bold faced lie.  I won't say that it was deserving of all the hype it received, because to say that would also be a bold faced lie.  No, `The Usual Suspects' is a decent crime thriller that proves to have a `twist' ending that becomes more and more predictable as you start putting pieces together.  The script is probably the best and worst thing about this movie.  When you look at all the thought that went into constructing the plot (or lack there of) you can't help but be taken aback by the effort put into it, but when all is said and done the twist at the end seems very rudimentary and the overall concept of the film lacks that freshness that could have been achieved had the envelope been pushed a little further.<br /><br />The film begins with a bang, or an explosion to be more precise.  A cargo ship goes up in flames and next thing you know we are brought back to how it all began, with five men standing in a lineup.  These five men include criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockey as well as one time cop Dean Keaton and small time crook Roger Kint, also known as Verbal (because he talks to much).  After the men meet the wheels are set in motion for something much more complicated (and possibly fabricated) than anything they've been involved with before; all of which boils down to a man named Keyser Soze.<br /><br />The film is told in flashbacks by Verbal as he is interrogated after the ship explosion, he being the only survivor.  As Verbal weaves a thick web of truth, partial truth and absolutely no truth it is up to Dave Kujan to sort through it all to find out just who Keyser Soze really is.<br /><br />The acting is truly hit or miss here, and I think the misses really took the overall experience of the film down a few notches.  The only real standout is Kevin Spacey who isn't even delivering his best (his performance in `Se7en' that same year is what should have garnered him the Oscar, not this one).  Among the decent are Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak and Chazz Postlewaite.  Stephen Baldwin is horrendous and Benicio Del Toro (an actor for which I am usually amazed by) is ridiculous here.  I understand creating a `character' and I can generally stand behind that, but his performance was so obnoxious and annoying that I loathed his presence on the screen.  Spacey at least develops a character that is interesting, and even though he has delivered much stronger performances in other films he really carries the bulk of this film on his shoulders, and the moments that do work, work because of him.<br /><br />The film noir style is also a bit off here.  I love a good film noir, and films like `Chinatown', `The Griffters' and the recent `Brick' really understood the concept and delivered brilliantly.  `The Usually Suspects' doesn't quite get it to the point where whole sequences come off as awkward as apposed to genuine.<br /><br />So a lot has been made about the `twist' that comes at the end of this film.  Some absolutely love it and stake their everlasting devotion to this film on the last few moments alone.  Others absolutely loathe it and feel that it killed the entire experience up till that point.  I'm personally torn because the `twist' comes in two parts really, and one part I find to be genius, the other I find to be a serious cop out; an easy route to take.<br /><br />I'm going to yell SPOILER right here so that I can't get yelled at for this and if you have not seen this movie you can stop reading right here.<br /><br />Having the revelation come about that the entire film up till the last few moments was a complete façade, an exaggerated fabrication of actual events, was genius.  Having the audience come to know that nothing they witnessed was actual and leaving them still scratching their heads, as was Kujan, wondering what `really' happened was just awesome in my opinion.  Having Verbal wind up being Soze was not.  I actually hate that aspect of the film.  It just feels so washed up to me, like they ran out of originality.  I guessed that Verbal was Soze about half way into the film, the moment Soze's name first came up and I was praying that the `twist' would prove me wrong.  Sadly, it didn't.  So I merely like the ending as apposed to hating or loving it.  I would probably still have nominated the screenplay since it was, for the most part, really well done, but I wouldn't have given it the Oscar.<br /><br />In the end I see `The Usual Suspects' as a decent thriller that entertains as best it can.  Some mediocre acting and one devastating plot blow brings the film down for me, but I can't say that it is a complete waste of time.  It ends up earning a high C, just barely under a low B.  It is good but it is missing a few key elements to reach greatness.just feels so washed up to me, like they ran out of originality.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|So many people seem to have the same issues with this movie: Not the original story, bad CGI, why does Angelina Jolie have heels. All of this is redundant. I was absolutely blown away with this movie when I saw it at the theater. I give full credit to how the writes decided to retie the story together. The opening scene was enough to keep you enticed for more. All the actors did an excellent job, especially Robin Wright Penn who I am normally not a fan of. I loved the way Grendel's mother was written. Everything about the scene between her and Beowulf made so much sense, including the fact that she was wearing heels naked (hello, seduction!). I loved how the story was meant to tie into itself. Some may never be able to accept the movie for what it was but I personally felt it was done quite well.
0684135051|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. Elizabeth Zimmerman has such a distinctive way of writing - you feel like you are listening in to one of her workshops. An absolute bonus were the many tit-bits of insightful and clever ways of dealing with many day-to-day knitting issues. I especially liked her way of shaping shoulders - why had I not thought of this before? If you have been knitting for a while so you know which aspects of knitted garments don't seem \\"quite right\\", then you will gleam many practical gems from this book.
1854875744|2.0|This re-read didn't hold up.<br /><br />Of course, I first read this in the late '70s and was wowed...but as pop culture has moved on this work's paranoia seems dated, quaint, and juvenile. The narrative itself is confused and turgid...with changing perspectives, ideological bloat-ware, clumsy sentences, and little appreciation for the uninitiated reader.<br /><br />If you are a student of '60s counter-culture/pop culture and fascinated by some dated conspiracy theories then you may find some value in this book.  This work also, partly, inspired Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum....a fine piece of literary fiction from the Italian Semiotician.<br /><br />General Recommendation: Don't wast your money.
0743290119|4.0|I've read both the Devil Wears Prada and Everyone Worth Knowing and was wholly unimpressed with both. I gave this book a whirl to give the author one last chance to redeem herself and she did. I really enjoyed the story lines and while there could have been a bit more character development, I could relate to the different issues that the characters faced. There was more brand dropping than necessary, but in my opinion it did not detract from the book in any meaningful manner. I would recommend the book, but maybe my perspective is different since I did not like the author's other two books at all and was hoping for something completely different. The characters were all facing challenges that you would expect single women in their late 20s living in NYC to be faced with. This was not great literature, but it was an enjoyable read that really picked up about 2/3 of the way through.
0061537934|5.0|I have waited years to come across a book that I could not put down.  I definitely could not put this book down: I would sneak a page or two while food was heating in the microwave.      I made 4 other people read the book; I gave the book as a gift to two others.  Definitely a 5-star book - hooray for Enzo!
031606792X|5.0|People, it's juvenile fiction.  I didn't have a way that I had envisioned for it to all work out.  I've had a true best friend of the opposite sex, been in love with my soul mate, had children... and to me, all the plots, story lines and character developments were not THAT unbelievable.  It basically just depends on your point of view and you personal life experiences.  It's all subjective.      I liked the first three books, thought the characters were interesting and engaging and I wanted to see the author's vision for how their story ends (or continues indefinitely...or whatever).  It's not my book.  I didn't write it.  I don't wish that I could change aspects of the book to fit what I would have preferred.  It is what it is...the final chapter of an author's vision.      To have a child with your soul mate is an unbelievable occurrence.  It's life changing.  Period.  You no longer are the same person.  You ARE a protector.  Everyday, even in mundane tasks.  OK, Bella changed.  She grew and matured, much faster than she normally would have had to with all the supernatural catalysts in her life.  I expected it.  Rejoiced in it with her.  I was happy for her in the end.  Even with the maturation of her character, she was always considered \\"special.\\"  The first three books gave us this insight with her natural ability to shield her mind from supernatural powers and the enormous capacity for love, regardless of circumstances (Edward, Jacob, etc.)  There's been a lot of flack about this natural extension into her immortal life via the \\"love shield\\" as some would call it, but it's really a logical and natural extension of Bella herself...It would seem illogical and too convenient to me if it hadn't been such a deeply rooted theme regarding her character in the first books.    I dunno, I guess I don't get all the intense criticism.    To say that she got it all without sacrificing anything is laughable.   Bella, as the heroine, went through a lot.  Either she was battered, bruised and fighting for her life or she was so emotionally torn up (and not just for Edward...), she couldn't function.  In every book she faced (and barely escaped) near death experiences.  There were two in this book with the pregnancy/immortality and the Volturi.  I'm confused; did people not want her to survive somewhat unscathed?  I thought that was the point of a good love story/soap opera.  You endure a lot for your happily ever after.    The whole thing about marriage at age 18 was a sacrifice for her.  It's not what she wanted.  It was a concession for her.  She didn't really want kids, but when faced with the real alternative of a child growing in her womb, she changed.  Nothing wrong with that.  I thought that was very realistic.    Bella never wanted to be taken care of.  Another concession on her behalf.  Ok, he's rich, but what hero in a fantasy love story isn't?  I would have found it more unbelievable if he had lived a century and hadn't found a way to acquire wealth.  If she gripes in the beginning, she will have lots of time to get over it and deal with it.  Also believable.    I really didn't want to hear full details about Edward and Bella's sex life.  The innuendos were enough for me and perfect for general young adult fiction.      To me, the book sends a message that young love, marriage and sexual intercourse come with heavy consequences, BUT if you can work through the issues, it can work out in the end.  But again, it may not be the best choice.  I may be alone in this, but being severely bruised up during sex, getting violently ill and turning up pregnant unexpectedly, and having the baby tear your body up from the inside out does NOT paint a pretty picture of early marriage, intercourse and the birthing experience.  Not to mention the myriad of issues the actual baby caused once born.  If I was a teen, I would be like \\"Dag...I thought it was going to be so different, like sunshine and roses once she got married to her true love, turned into a vampire and had a baby...\\"  Yeah, it turned out great in the end, but not before a lot of physical pain and mental anguish.  Just like life can sometimes be.  Again, I thought this was pretty realistic.    I thought Edward was doing what he thought he had to in order to preserve Bella's life that hung so precariously in the world of nearly indestructible immortals.  When he had to, he offered her choices within the boundaries that would still keep her safe.  She wasn't immortal.  She needed help and protection to stay alive.  If he was so controlling and manipulative, he would not have gone along with her wishes to have the baby.  Most times he felt helpless.    I'm glad Jacob found his true soul mate.  I'm glad that it happened to be Bella's daughter.  The biological aspects of imprinting to me dismissed the notion that Nessie was Jacob's second choice.  Imprinting goes above and beyond the human notion of love as demonstrated by Leah and Sam.  Yes, Nessie is an extension of Bella, but he imprinted with her because it was their destiny.  He still loves Bella, but it pales in comparison (much like what Bella may have felt for Jacob while with Edward).  His focus is now the child, but again he obviously still cares for and loves Bella.  It's convenient, I know, but it works for me.   Not implausible.    Sheeesh.  The characters in the story went through an awful lot to get to where they ended up in the end.  Everyone struggled and everyone sacrificed.  Physically, but most importantly, emotionally.  Everyone.  No one escaped unscathed in some way.  To me, this made the ending all that much more satisfying.    This book is still all about choice and sacrifice.  Not only of the central characters, but of peripheral characters (vampires, wolves AND humans) some newly introduced in this book.  EVERYONE had choices to make, central to their survival.  Some were easier than others, but still all made choices.    I hadn't planned to write this much, but the thoughts came easily, so I did...    Again, I think it's subjective.  Many people have strong feelings about the characters and how they believe the story should end.      Read it for yourself and decide.  I'd also recommend reading the first three in succession before you read this one.  I did.  I was surprised at the elements I missed the first time around or had forgotten about.  The story felt more like a natural continuation and I relied on printed words to fuel my thoughts about the book rather my somewhat distorted memory of the first three.    I am an eternal optimist.  I love the underlying theme of hope.  You may struggle fiercely through the night, but joy will (and SHOULD) come in the morning.  The title was extremely appropriate...
0316143472|4.0|[[ASIN:0316143472 When You Are Engulfed in Flames]]<br /><br />From rural USA to Paris France, David Sedaris pulls off an interesting and humorous collection of stories. This is the first book from David that I have read and I will confess that I will be reading more from David in the near future.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Unlike other reviews that felt the movie was a bit too long, I felt that the pacing fit perfectly with all the principals investigative skills and the fantastic and engrossing acting abilities of Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Elias Koteas. You feel the tension, pain, confusion and frustration these [investigators], both police and journalist experienced through their investigation(s) of this infamous murder suspect. Brian Cox played a short but admirable part as Attorney Melvin Belli; who's office I once had the pleasure of \\"visiting\\", picking up legal documents as a process server in the City of San Francisco. What a character he was. And what a great group of good-looking \\"female legal assistants\\" he had in that office.<br /><br />The more I watch such top-notch acting jobs performed by these stars, the more I appreciate how much work and effort they put into their jobs that sometimes make you feel like they're the real characters and not acting. Superb Directing by David Fincher.<br /><br />What a great movie. I live right next to San Francisco (Daly City) and was in high school when these killings started. They were the talk of the town. One of the best murder-suspense movies ever made.

0060922583|4.0|Other than a very rudimentary understanding, or rather acknowledgment of the existence of holograms/holographic science via watching too many Star Trek reruns, I hadn't the first clue the impact of holography.  What this book does very well is offer some salient facts about the science as it relates to the deeper mysteries of life.  Is this a science textbook?  No!  It is a well thought out, well written treatise on the possible implications of a holographic universe.  Clearly, scientific materialists are not going to like this book as it speaks of things that can't be seen or measured, but what the hell is wrong with some discussion, some insight, inspiration, a \\"leap of faith\\" just to get the creative juices flowing?!  I found this to be an exhilarating read.
031606792X|4.0|I read the spoiler reviews on Amazon before I read the novel, and based on some of the harsh criticisms I was all set to be disappointed.  I have read Breaking Dawn three times all the way through, and I feel like I've been able to appreciate it more and more each time.  Frankly, I think the biggest problem with the book is that it really should have been divided into two novels.  Either that, or some of the crucial background story regarding the immortal children should have been introduced in an earlier book.  Sliding all that background in during the second chapter of BreakingDawn made it feel like a plot afterthought, and I think Meyer is too talented a writer to have done things that way.      I know that a lot of readers felt like this book contained major character alterations, some of which weren't plausible.  Again, some of that may have to do with how much Meyer crammed into these seven hundred odd pages.  During my second and third readings, I was paying more attention to the way she shows character development, and the reasonable progression is there, it's just crammed in among so much other stuff that it's not obvious.  On the other hand, I really enjoyed the dual narrators, because Bella and Jacob were able to see each other's growth, as well as one another's flaws.  I hope she does more with Jacob in future books.      I can understand why people felt cheated by the ending--yes, everything works out just fine.  All I can say is that in all the interviews I've seen, Meyer has never tried to sell this series as anything more than a love story.  We as readers tried to elevate the Twilight books to the epic level of the Harry Potter series, so I don't think we can cry foul upon discovering a typical romance novel ending.      I only gave Breaking Dawn four stars because of a major chronological hitch that I'm surprised the editors didn't catch.  There is a scene in the third part of the novel where Bella comes into the house in the morning--Meyer tells usit's around seven A.M.--watches the baby eating breakfast and listens to Alice start griping about how Jacob has erased her schedule for the day.  We find out why she's complaining, but in the process Jacob and Bella keep talking about things that happened \\"this afternoon\\" or \\"tonight\\" but there is no time span in the middle.  The inconsistancy of the timing annoyed me and jolted me away from the narrative, so I'm taking some points off.  Otherwise, the book was fun, heartwarming and satisfying, and when I read romantic fiction that's exactly what I want.
B000MKXEME|4.0|Jeffrey Combs, better known as Special Agent Dammers ([[ASIN:B000ASATYO The Frighteners (Director's Cut)]] plays Herbert West in this delightful interpretation of HP Lovecraft's series of short stories. Herbert West is a medical student with an interest in death, but more importantly in reanimating the dead. With a nod to voodoo zombies, he uses a serum to reanimate the recently deceased, but lacks control over them, turning them into rampaging monsters similar to those later found in 28 Days/Weeks Later. Add a corrupt Professor/Doctor, a naive Med Student, his bimbo-esque fiance and her Dean father, Re-Animator is an almost Zombie movie that doesn't take itself too seriously with funny one-liners, plenty of gore, and a great score, reminiscent of Psycho. This film is recommended for fans of zombie movies (Dead Alive & Shaun of the Dead especially), cult films, and people who are just a little bit weird/strange/unusual.

0785125965|5.0|I am a huge Hulk fan. When I was a kid, it was one of the comics I would pick up each month. When Planet Hulk arrived, my fanfare for the Green Goliath was renewed. Even though this story might be a bit lacking in plot - it is supposed to be. I have learned that when the Hulk is really mad, he smashes and usually doesn't stop for a while. That is basically what this story is about. I think everyone knew that going into it, so I am really not sure why people seem so upset about the story. After the long-winded, highly policital (and still not over yet) Civil War Saga, I just wanted to beat the living snot out of most of the Marvel Universe. Luckily, the Hulk did that for me. If you want to see the Hulk barrel through the entire Marvel Universe, this is the story to get. If you are looking for plot, look elsewhere - there is only smashing here.

B001675YQ6|3.0|I like Brittany Murphy a lot but this is not the right vehicle for her. She's not a fashionista and lacks the kind of poise it takes to walk comfortably in high heels. Almost all of the shots of her 'strutting' were cut to less than a step so you can see what she looks like but not how she moves. It was the same with the tango dance scene. Quick edits work as a disguise. I don't think the beehive hairdos work on her but if you like Brittany Murphy you should see this film. It won't make you dislike her and the film is mildly clever.<br /><br />A handful of male actors performed well and gave the film most of its charm. The two female actors, besides Brittany, were junk. The two women, mother and daughter, trying to act likeably eccentric were annoying, shallow and superfluous to the story. They weren't even acceptable caricatures of likeably eccentric. Chain smoking cigarettes does not eccentric make.<br /><br />I don't think it really counts as a spoiler to let people know that Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom are on the screen for about 20 seconds. That was part of the cleverness of the film. They 'play' the parts of the 'happily-ever-after' couple in the Hollywood version of the movie we're watching as it is written by one of the characters in the movie.
0385340990|5.0|The Stern Librarian always feels particularly self-conscious when she reviews a book about a book club.  Most likely real book club members, who are serious readers, will be drawn to the novel and, therefore, my modest review.  Self-consciousness begone, I know every book club member out there will agree with me that this first novel deserves a rave.  The most refreshing thing about this wonderful new epistolary novel is that it features a book club with male members!  The society at the novel's center also features people who are new to reading!  This is a bit of a hard book to describe, its characters a combination of Evelyn Waugh beautiful young things and D.H. Lawrence strong country folk.  The great leveler of World War II somehow dashes these class distinctions.  Presented as a series of letters, the novel breezes by, perhaps a little more so in the first half (before Juliet goes to Guernsey) than the second half.  Patrons will learn a great deal about the Channel Islands during World War II and, if they are like me, will be ashamed not to have known the situation there already.  Even more delightfully, we discovery forgotten writers, like Charles Lamb, for whom I am now positively ravenous.  This book cries out for a sequel--and perhaps a mystery series of her own devoted to Guernsey's Miss Marple.  Trust me though, you won't want to make the recipes.  The Stern Librarian (I have never stopped writing letters).

1594489505|5.0|Hosseini's new book is even better than the wildly popular Kite Runner. Written simply with plot twists, readers looking for an entertaining read will not be disappointed. Hosseini's book may not be an example of fine writing but he makes up for it with his clarity in story telling.     If you ever wonder what life is like for families where women wear hejabs, burquas or chadors, you will gain more of an understanding from this book granted that it is a work of fiction. Being originally from Afganistan and having worked there recently, the author has painted a convincing picture of life in this war torn country.    Whether you are interested in learning about other cultures or are simply looking for an entertaining read, I highly recommend this well told story.
1416914285|2.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? Clare is definitely able to write an exciting story that keeps readers flipping the pages and her world is certainly interesting. However, she brings nothing new to the world of urban fantasy. Ideas are recycled, recycled and recycled some more. Cliches abound. References are far too easy to spot. But that's just the beginning.    Supposedly normal characters react to surreal situations in unrealistic ways. Twists in plotlines are telegraphed beforehand to the point that I find it mind-boggling that the characters couldn't figure it out themselves. If the characters really are that stupid or oblivious for a legitimate reason justified by the narrative, then that's fine. But this just came off as a very amateurish act by the author to make sure that the big twist isn't revealed until a crucial moment at the end - all at the expense of the reader's willingness to suspend belief.    Her writing style is also pretty annoying. Her similes are ridiculous and overused. Her dialogue tries too hard to sound like an episode of Buffy and ends up sounding like a cheap knock off. Joss Whedon was able to create dialigue that was snappy, hip and yet still seemed to fit his young characters despite the fact that there are maybe three teenagers in the entire world capable of speaking with such wit. Clare couldn't pull it off and as a result it made her characters seem both dubious and pretentious.    Characters barely break the second-dimension in terms of personalities. Isabelle has no personality and her skankiness does NOT make her awesome -just creepy (as she's apparently only about fourteen). Simon is the geek, this book's Xander, so we're supposed to laugh at him. Clary is also supposedly a geek but never does anything particularly geeky so as to not compromise her Mary Sueness. Clary is also supposed to be clumsy, but performs graceful actions when in a fight, even after only supposedly being introduced to this terrifying world for a few days. I also do NOT appreciate the entire 'oh she thinks she's plain, but people say she looks just like her mom, who just happens to be gorgeous!' gimmick. If she's beautiful, just say she's beautiful. Don't try to make her more endearing to young normal female readers by feebly pretending that she's nothing special in the looks department. Then there's Jace, who's your typical snarky pretty boy with a Tragic Past. Sexy at times, but mostly a yawn. If you want to make your pretty boys complex, do more than just paste on some angst. Really, Alec is the only one who seems to have some semblance of depth. Too bad he was pwned to make Mary Sue Clary look even better, and beaten up to provide Jace with more angst.    The plot itself didn't seem to be carefully crafted. We were introduced to the world rather blandly (pages of forced exposition yay!), given a premise (Big Bad Guy wants to do a Big Bad Thing and needs this Special Item to do it). Then after that the story just meanders, jumping from misadventure to misadventure without any real purpose until the story's last stretch, climax and ending. Plots have to be created so that events lead into each other and build upon each other. Of course sometimes 's**t happens'; random events occur. But ultimately it all has to work together to bring the story to its climax. This just felt like a bunch of stuff thrown together to fill up pages. Mildly entertaining, but kind of pointless and very shallow.    All in all, Clare seems to do only the bare minimum that might endear her to her target teenage audience: she successfully delivers a fun story with pretty characters, lots of action and plenty of melodrama to spare. But she didn't seem to want to bother with improving on her story by fleshing out her characters, thinking more deeply about her plot and creating a more original world. Everything about City of Bones remains on the surface, almost defiantly so, which obviously yielded half-assed results.

061891868X|5.0|Peter Shor provides an excellent summarizing review of the first half to three-quarters of the book. But he largely skimped on what I think Smolin's main focus was, based on reading Smolin's website and the author's notes in the book, when he began the book. The last few chapters are concerning the role of academia in maintaining integrity throughout their ranks. If Smolin is correct, and this book provides excellent support to believe so, this has not been done with string theory, regardless of whether it is a correct theory or not. It is an extremely volatile subject that is likely to explode in the next few decades, and not only in physics but all academic fields.    I feel the situations is complicated, but can be roughly simplified as the selfishness and fear of a group of highly respected (and sometimes also highly paid, but not always) individuals who perceived that they were not making any progress and seek to protect their respected status through manipulation. They are essentially echoing an everyday experience - even the most ignorant person can seem quite capable if they merely exude enough self confidence. Well, according to the accounts by Smolin and many others, the string theorists are doing exactly that - holding onto excessive and unfounded confidence. Unfortunately, the first step in gaining knowledge is to admit that you already possess none.    Smolin takes a much less accusational stance than I do here, but he spends a significant amount of time in his book discussing this issue and it should not be left out of the reviews.    --G. Hill

B0016OMFPW|5.0|I have listened to Roy Hargrove's work for years. Early, he had great tone and feeling for the music. However the last few albums seemed too experimental and noisy for my tastes. On his latest he has returned to a more lyrical and melodic approach and I think this is a great improvement.<br /><br />His slower lyrical ballads stand out, whether we are talking about standards like \\"Speak Low\\" or some of his original ballads, like \\"Joy is Sorrow Unmasked\\" and \\"Divine\\" all are played with a lot of feeling.<br /><br />There was a particular sound to Blue Note jazz in the late 50's to early 60's. Hank Mobley in particular and Lee Morgan sometimes had this breezy moderate tempo sound that seemed, to me at least, full of optimism. Like Mobley's work with The Jazz Messengers, maybe \\"Nica's Dream\\" or \\"Ecaroh\\". (That type of song disappeared in the turmoil of the late 60's, but that's another story). Anyway that sound, that groove, is here in a number of songs like \\"Wisdom to the Prize\\". Again, welcome!<br /><br />Most of the album is tuneful and lyrical and relaxed, like the music not of a young turk, but of a master. Earfood, and a nurishing meal!  Recommended.
0394818237|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old and she absolutely loves it!  It is really great for kids who have a million questions about how things work and it does a phenomenal job of explaining a typical process (e.g., building a house) from end to end (including laying sewage and water pipes underneath the ground).  It gives the details that curious kids really want to know in a fun, darling way.
B00003CXDV|5.0|\\"Schtinky\\" having already explained the plot very well I will only add I just watched my copy the other night again for probably the fifth time, and expect I'll watch it a bunch more times.  I think whether being a fan of Star Trek or not isn't really important.  \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is about a cast of actors who share a history (having worked together in a discontinued long-running Star Trek-like television series), have been resting on their laurels and finding it tedious and one another irritating, and are hoping for another t.v. gig.  When they find themselves zapped into their old show, but for real and facing honest-to-goodness aliens, their ensemble acting skills kick in.  Many important life lessons, sweet and bittersweet, are shared using uproarous humor and sensitivity.  The acting is outstanding all around -- everyone shines.  I can't recommend it enough!
0553208845|4.0|On a whim I picked this one up, knowing of it and recognizing the book title.  I knew nothing of what the book was about, except what I could surmise from the cover.<br /><br />I was a little put off initially with the way Hesse wrote, kind of flighty with nothing too concrete or definite.  Is it a spiritual quest, a personal quest and so on.  Then as Siddhartha grows older within the book we begin to see the natural progression from one mental/spiritual situation to the next.  We see him go from spiritual, to rich, gambling, to being poor to a heightened spiritual state and so on.<br /><br />All in all, after I worked my way into the flesh of Hesse's writing, I began to enjoy Siddhartha.  You feel as though you are on the spiritual voyage with him and can understand where he is coming from.  I am glad that there were only 150 pages and it was a fast read, because I most certainly would not want to read this style of writing for very long.  I would recommend.<br /><br />4 stars.

This is by far the BEST CD THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN YEARS!!!!<br /><br />Van Nuys is an unbeliveable track full of truth.  In fact, this whole CD is full of truth.  In an unbeliveable way, this CD is very inspirational!<br /><br />Life is Beautiful is such an unreal song.  The music and lyrics are amazing.<br /><br />Girl with Golden eyes-  I love how this as well as most of the music on this CD flows!  Beautifully written and composed.

031606792X|5.0|No Spoilers---  As an ending to Bella, Edward and Jacob's story, this book delivers its promise. We get to know the fate of our favourite characters - in a very satisfying manner. The sad part is that it is the last book, and it is hard to part with characters with whom most of us readers have felt an almost intimate relationship with. After reading this book, I am left yearning for more from the Twilight world, and I hope that Mrs. Meyer gives us Midnight Sun soon so that we get to know the Twilight Saga story through Edward's eyes.
0316010669|5.0|This is a very good book. (Sorry to repeat myself...) I really appreciate the other side of the coin. Thinking has been drilled into my head and I tend to totally ignore anything else. If it isn't a fact that I can define, it can't be not real or true. But there is some value in intuition. Some things are under the radar of our thought, (and should be, or we'd be overwhelmed), but they can be important. Intuition is our way of communicating that to ourselves.    This book has gotten some criticism - of course people should think. But there has not been much written on the power of intuition. When a person is knowledgeable about a subject, and they feel like something is wrong, they should trust, or at least acknowledge and respect that feeling. You can't just trust your intuition (make a guess) and go with it if you don't know anything about the thing you are \\"guessing\\" about. But if you do know about something, say you are an expert on US Currency (or someone who handles money alot), and you see a $20 bill that something seems wrong, should you act on that instinct, or do you say - \\"I can't see anything specifically wrong with it, so it must be ok.\\"? If you were a foreigner, and came to the US, and looked at a $20 bill and said - something seems wrong about this, of course you can't go with that feeling, because you don't know anything about a $20 bill.    Anyways, read the book. It's worth it.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I bought this CD for my Puerto Rican husband and he LOVES it.  He sings along and says it takes him back to his teen years in PR.
0525950079|4.0|I bought this book when it was first released but have hesitated to pick it up because of its size.  I need not have worried: the 1100+ pages took about 11 hours to read and it was a delightful escape into a fictional piece peopled with dastardly villains, noble heroes and good-hearted souls.<br /><br />While 'Pillars' laid the foundations for `World Without End', this book only felt like a sequel when I regarded Kingsbridge and the cathedral as the central characters instead of the people.  Once I did that, the story fell quite neatly into place.<br /><br />This is not a difficult book to read and while historical accuracy can (and should be) questioned, Mr Follett's strength is in recounting the feelings of his characters.  Sure, some happenings seem quite contrived to make particular points but basic human needs, wants and reactions have remained similar for millennia.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, four children (Gwenda, Caris, Merthin and Ralph) witness two men being killed in the forest.  The mystery of the killing is only explained towards the end of the novel and yet it casts a long shadow over many of the happenings.  We follow the lives of Gwenda, Caris, Merthin and Ralph for a period of 34 years (1327 to 1361).  We share their transition from childhood to adulthood: their successes, their failures, their hopes and dreams.  Their lives are intertwined with each other, and also with the future and fortunes of Kingsbridge.  These are momentous years: the onset of the Black Plague brings enormous social and economic upheaval while war with France (the early part of the Hundred Year War) provided opportunities for some.<br /><br />If you finished `Pillars' wondering about the future, and you are happy to revisit Kingsbridge 200 years later, this novel will take you there.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B00008NRL8|5.0|I was introduced to this CD by my cousin Chike (who is aware that I love experimenting musically), and I love it! The Gotan Project (Gotan is a reversal of the syllables in the word Tango) comprises a multinational trio, and their style is Jazzy Electro Tango (well, that's how I describe it), largely instrumental, with a few vocals usually spoken and in Spanish.<br /><br />However, an understanding of Spanish isn't necesary to appreciate this calming, beautiful music. Yes, it does sound like what you'd hear in the background at some swanky lounge or bar (like the Amazon review mentions), but it's one that would have you asking the waiter \\"Who plays that?\\".<br /><br />My favourites are \\"Una musica brutal\\" (with lovely female vocals), the piano driven beauty \\"Last tango in Paris\\", \\"La del ruso\\", and the eerie sounding horn sprinkled \\"Chunga's revenge\\" (with male spoken vocals), apparently a remake of a Frank Zappa song.<br /><br />Very classy Chill Out music. Thank you Chike!
B000FVE3A2|4.0|I have owned this watch for about 6 months now.  It performs well, and keeps good time as long as I keep wearing it.  I must admit to having several decent watches, so I don't wear this one every day.    Overall, the watch is nice.  It is stylish and tough.  The band shows minimal scuffing for the wear it has received.  The hands glow nicely for quite a while....not as long as I would like, but are still dimly visible all night.    On the negative side, after I bought this watch, the clasp started to come undone whenever I flexed my wrist.  Another watch wasn't available, so I had the choice to either return it for a refund or send it to Invicta for repairs.  I had bought an extended warranty that included the band and the crystal - everything on the watch was covered.  So the retailer was nice enough to send it in for me.  It took almost 3 weeks to get it back, but it performs well and has never given me a problem again.  In fact, I now have to work to get it off!  Another thing to consider before you buy one is that is is very heavy.  I never forget I have this watch on when I go to bed.  But if you are looking for a large impressive watch, I would recommend this one.

B00026WUAU|5.0|There are two songs on this disk that exemplify the \\"what planet did this guy come from\\" type of songwriting and delivery that Dylan, at his best, can conjure.      First, New Pony- gritty, dirty, mean- straight blues- delivered with a kind of nasty gutsiness that's very rare.  Lyrically obscure, haunting, very powerful.  Has to do in some way with fatal attraction- push and pull of sexual attraction- but elevated into some mystical realm that only Dylan walks in- welcome to the tour, please keep your hands inside the shuttle at all times.    And then to what is, IMHO, the best Dylan song of all time- the harrowing, hallucinatory Senor.  This is like an epic dream, vivid and crisp, but only loosely remembered.  We're dropped into the middle of a tight situation- dripping with atmosphere- there's a monstrous ominous looming *something* and the threat of violence just around the corner- but also the possiblity of salvation- not sure what any of it's really about, but we've all been there at one time or another.  Some for months or years at a time.      I don't think for a second that everyone, or even most, will agree with me on these two songs.  Don't see how, but neither of these are ever mentioned in Dylan's best.

B000E8N690|5.0|Being A Johnny Cash fan, I loved this movie...  Joaquin Phoenix really resembles \\"The Man In Black\\"    Reese Witherspoom resembles June Carter     the only  question that I have is :Couldn't they( the people  at  the movie   studio ) have taught them  how to  sing?    I'm tired of movies in  which the stars only lip synch to the sound track( Sweet Dreams is the best example of this fraudulant practice)  Since ,this is  a biopic   ,I'd Expect Joaquin Pheonix to at least  to play the guitar,instead of faking it!!
B0001I561E|5.0|Sure, there are the classics like CINDERELLA and SLEEPING BEAUTY.  There are Pixar marvels like WALL-E and FINDING NEMO (which I adore).  But for me, the real golden age of Disney came during the time when Alan Menken made animated musicals.  POCHAHONTAS, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THE LITTLE MERMAID, and ALADDIN are some.  These are the real Disney classics.    I recieved this as an unexpected Christmas present several years ago, and was pleasantly surprised.  I watched the film and the special features.  They impressed me beyond compare.  Besides the glorious film itself, the special features are some of the very best I've seen, and that's saying a lot.  THREE WISHES, the comprehensive making-of documentary, is a joy to watch.  The cartoon of the Genie's round-the-world vacation is short but sweet, and the 3D magic carpet adventure is stunning.  And those are just three.    Of course, if you don't like the movie, there's no reason to buy this DVD.  But if your a long-time fan of the film and are waiting for a good oppurtunity to toss out your old VHS tape, then this is it.
031606792X|4.0|To those individuals who lament the exclusion of empowering feminist/individualist morals in this book, I see your point. But throughout the past three books, Meyer has consistently explained to us her vision of love, using Bella as a mouthpiece, and it is a passionate, intense, no-holds-barred, inexorable leap off the proverbial (or, in Bella's case, quite literal) cliff. It's no wonder she quotes \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" the quintessential novel for the late 1800s transcendentalist/romantic view of love! Seen through this lens, love is completely irrational, self-sacrificial, and the only thing worth living for. Even the emphasis on nature as a fitting setting for love harkens back to the great romantic poets and writers, and \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is Meyer's final testament to the purity of this ideal. As Cathy says in \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" \\"I am Heathcliff,\\" and it isn't a stretch to imagine Bella saying, \\"I am Edward\\" because she has allowed herself to love him utterly and completely, even to the point of forgoing any outside pursuits or individual ambitions. She loves him as only an inexperienced, naive, trusting, and idealistic young woman can, and unlike most of us denizens of the real world, her love is reciprocated in full. Fairytale? Most definitely. But to those who say that this escapist fantasy has no morals to convey, you are dead wrong. It is a fitting ending to an epic romance that has deemed love to be transcendent, unselfish, and the only thing we really need in order to be happy. Think about it. No matter the clothes, jobs, houses, and all of the effort it took to get where you are, if you had a chance to love someone as passionately and unconditionally as Bella loves Edward, and to be loved that way in return, wouldn't you throw it all away just to be with that person? Just to experience that kind of love? We all seek meaning in our lives, and isn't that the greatest purpose of all? Meyer thinks so, and that's what this book is all about.     **Spoiler**  The ending is not explosive, but serene and utterly blissful. Bella and Edward are content to lose themselves in each other, and my question is, how could anyone deem that to be immoral? To love and trust someone so much that your very purpose in life is their continued existence is a grand and beautiful thing, and another tribute to the idea of love as selflessness--not the lack of self, but the willing bequeathal of self to another. Love is enough, in the end, to win over Charlie despite the strangeness of Bella's new life. It's enough to convince Carlisle's friends to stand witness, enough to galvanize the wolves into standing with the Cullens, and enough to allow Jacob and Bella to remain friends despite her transformation. Yes, some things work out too perfectly, but, once again, this is a fairy tale.  Most profoundly, love is enough for Bella to keep her child despite the hell it puts her through. An obvious point that wasn't explicitly expounded upon by Meyer but that maybe should have been is that this is EDWARD'S child! How could she ever, EVER allow something that holds a part of him to die?     So yes, die-hard realists and cynics may say that this book conveys an inappropriate acceptance of teen pregnancy, not going to college, and an unhealthy view of the easiness with which money can be acquired. But to all those wandering, thoughtful, idealistic, and passionate romantics, this is a gem as well as a fitting and satisfying ending.

I think this was a great book and I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes paranormal FICTION novels.
0312427999|2.0|In 1981, after the ruthless dictator Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected government of  socialist Salvador Allende, free-market ideologue  Friedrich von Hayek was interviewed by the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio. Hayek approved of Pinochet's brutal rule, saying \\"Personally I prefer a liberal dictator to democratic government lacking liberalism.\\" It is this (my example, not hers) and related opinions of free-marketers that draw the ire of Naomi Klein in this history of market liberalization attempts around the world in the past several decades. The Chilean case is among the more egregious attempts to thwart popular will, as the University of Chicago economics department, inspired by the anti-government diatribes of Milton Friedman, intentionally set up a situation in Chile where free market principles could be imposed rapidly and completely (this is the Shock Doctrine in title of Klein's book) upon the subdued masses.<br /><br />Another horrible example of the Shock Doctrine is the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) catechism that a country in the throes of crisis must slash social welfare spending before it can be given financial aid. Just this week, a report in the New Scientist (26 July 2008) showed that the result of IMF policies, there is a strong positive association between IMF aid and the incidence of childhood tuberculosis, a sensitive bellwether of general public health and well-being.<br /><br />Of course, these human rights violations of free-marketers pale before the gulags and mass starvations that mark the ministrations of the communist central planners, but Klein is certainly not of that ilk. She reveals her own sympathies towards the end of the book, when she remarks that \\"Democratic socialism, meaning not only socialist parties brought to power through elections but also democratically run workplaces and land holdings, has worked in many regions, from Scandinavia to the thriving and historic cooperative economy in Italy's Emilia Romagna region. It was a version of this combination of democracy and socialism that Allende was attempting to bring to Chile between 1970 and 1973.\\" (p.569)<br /><br />Klein maintains that this form of democratic socialism is vastly generalizable, which accounts for the deep fear the free-marketers have of popular social initiatives. \\"Shock resistance,\\" she writes, \\"has spread to many other former shock victims---Chile, Bolivia, China, Lebanon. And as people shed the collective fear that was first instilled with tanks and cattle prods, with sudden flights of capital and brutal cutbacks, many are demanding more democracy and more control over markets. These demands represent the greatest threat of all to Friedman's legacy, because they challenge his most central: that capitalism and freedom are part of the same individual project.\\" (p. 565)<br /><br />It would be nice if this were the case, but it most certainly is not. First, right wing free-marketers are a small group of ideologues that are treated with bemused contempt by serious students of economic policy. Milton Friedman was a brilliant economist, but he free-market rantings in his later years were simply embarrassing. There is absolutely no future in free-market economics, and it is not taught in any respectable economics department, including the University of Chicago. The modern economy is inevitably, and deeply, government regulated, and the welfare state, which redistributes huge sums from the more to the less well off, is not threatened anywhere.  The IMF is indeed practically Neanderthal in its ideology and behavior, but most economists, and indeed whole governments, are hostile to its ambitions.<br /><br />On the other hand, it would be nice if Klein's alternative were generally viable. Thomas Jefferson's vision of forty acres and a mule would be vindicated, albeit in a more socially organized manner. But it is not. Worker's control is a great dream (I dreamed it myself for many years), but it founders on the reality of capital diversification, which the worker-owned firm cannot handle. Cooperative land holding is just a myth, pure and simple, and always has been, throughout human history.<br /><br />Like many progressives, Klein's instincts are anti-market (although even her precious cooperatives are marketing cooperatives, after all). It is a plain-faced fact that poor countries that have attempted to compete in the world market place rather than shelter themselves from it have done quite well,  China and India being the most prominent. The idea that socialist cooperatives might outcompete capitalist firms has little going for it. Perhaps a country with mountainous oil revenues can play at sounding anti-capitalist (e.g., contemporary Venezuela), but the future of prosperity in virtually all poor countries depends on developing markets and state institutions that support markets in a synergistic and democratic manner. It is up to us to dirty our hands (and hearts?) to help them attain this, rather than remaining pure but ineffectual, fighting for a socialist world that, far from struggling to be born, simply cannot exist.eality of capital diversification, which the worker-owned firm cannot handle.

037571457X|4.0|With Marjane Satrapi's animated film playing in theatres and available on disc, I almost jumped at the chance to read her book, the part-comic/part-memoir of Satrapi's childhood in Tehran, Iran.    To avoid confusion with more current events, `Marji' (as she was called as a child) recalls her upbringing in a Marxist family, the fall of the last Shah regime, the Islamic Revolution of 1979, and Iran's war against Iraq in the 80's.  While Satrapi's words are powerful enough to get in your head and stay there, her simple black-and-white drawing style captures the laughter, the tears, and the raw emotion felt throughout the story.  Though only an individual account, the story itself is quite vivid in describing how Iran had left a world of tyranny and chaos--only to wind up in another.  Though controversial in its own right, \\"Persepolis\\" is still a riveting book for those seeking intelligent reading.    This comic is unrated: Violence, Adult Language, Adult Situations.

Do youself a favor and buy this album and throw it in your car CD player, you wont take it out for months.

031606792X|3.0|I have to say I agree with many of the low reviews for this book.  It was kind of weird- the whole pregnancy thing and with Jacob imprinting on the baby.  Bella's whole character seemed to change.  I can see how people would take the book as a cop-out and that the message is to get married and pregnant at 18.  I can see, however, that the author was trying to show that Bella did have strength through her \\"gift\\" of protection and the only way she could have discovered her \\"gift\\" was by being vampire-strong, and having something she loved more than anything to protect.  If she had not had the baby, she may not have discovered her powers.  Although, I kind of thought she was supposed to love Edward enough to do anything to protect him, but whatever.  The vampire sex thing was also weird and I thought that Stephanie Meyer could have considered her audience of young girls more.  I thought the Jacob part was goofy and that he really changed in character.  All that said, I was entirely entertained throughout the book and it was a page turner.
B00070DK14|5.0|This album has been much underappreciated it seems and the poor mastering on the original CD release didn't help ... however, this remastered version is here to set the record straight ... not only do you get a nicely remastered CD you get 8 bonus tracks, none of which are simply filler ... in fact, I enjoy the bonus tracks every bit as much as the previously released ones ... Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow has become one of my absolute favorite Tull tracks ...

0767827791|5.0|Brought back many pleasant memories to my wife and I from our high school days.  This has always been a favorite movie of ours.
B00003CX9E|5.0|It's the best I've ever seen.  Why?  Because it enters a world of psychology in a unique and powerful way.  It exposes the selfish tyrant that lies in all of us.  Do we not all do what we do for \\"I?\\"  What drives us to be what we become?  What is our most basic need, our most primal desire?    This film deals with these things in a visceral experience of entertainment.  This film had to be quite a risk for 1941 but it's clear that it could not have been any better if made in 2001.  I thoroughly enjoyed every last second of it.    If you were expecting an adventure through the mountains and woods there's no doubt that you hated it.  But, if you enjoy a trek through the secrets of the human mind, then this film is right up your alley.    And, for Pete's sake, don't desire to see Star Wars in everything.    The work in this film creation is astonishing in 2008.  In 1941 it would have been state of the art.  In fact, it's hard to believe the film wasn't made in 2008.  It's clearly ahead of it's time.

I am disappointed that she seems to have scanned all the fanfic sites and stolen the most absurd plot points. I have actually read many fanfics that were better thought out than the plot of this novel. This book tarnishes the first three and does a great injustice to her readers and herself.

0307269965|5.0|Great novels may speak to universal human concerns, but they do so by means of particulars, and those particulars interlock in different ways with the experience of each different reader. We come to books by different routes in terms of personal background, literary expectations, or cultural climate; it is only reasonable to acknowledge them. For example, I was initially attracted to the book by its resonance with my own Oxbridge days, the seduction of people from older families or greater wealth, and late adolescent confusion about sexuality and religion. More recently, I come to BRIDESHEAD REVISITED after reading a number of earlier Waugh books, together with those of his fellow convert to Catholicism, Graham Greene; this perspective casts a different light on a book that I knew only from the now-iconic BBC serial of 1981. And more recently still, there is stimulus of the new Miramax movie, a magnificent experience whose significant differences from the book nonetheless help to focus on what Waugh was actually doing. Personal, literary, and cultural: let me address these points in the opposite order. I shall try not to give any outright spoilers, but I am writing for people who already know the general outline of the story.<br /><br />The movie first: splendid acting, fine period detail, and a feast for the eyes -- although Castle Howard in Yorkshire, one of Britain's grandest buildings, is surely at least twice the size of Brideshead. My greatest surprise in reading the book was to discover how many liberties the screenwriters had taken with the dramaturgy of the original. It was not just a matter of removing discursive passages and tightening things up; significant events had been taken out of order and others inserted, with invented dialogue to go with them. In both film and novel, the middle-class narrator Charles Ryder falls under the spell in turn of Lord Sebastian Flyte, his ancestral home Brideshead, and his sister Julia. The movie makes much more of the implied homoeroticism between Charles and Sebastian (which Waugh probably could not have done even if he had wanted to), but it also introduces his awareness of Julia quite early as a counterpoint to this, culminating in an episode in Venice which effectively causes a break with Sebastian. By the time Sebastian and Charles have parted in the book, however, Julia has made only peripheral appearances and has barely entered Charles' radar. Similarly near the end of the movie, the scene where Charles bargains for Julia with her Canadian husband Rex Mottram has no equivalent in the book whatsoever; Waugh simply glides over the transition as though it didn't matter. But then Waugh treats Julia's marriage to Rex as a hole-in-the-corner affair; he is a divorced man whom, as a Catholic, she can marry only in a state of sin. In the movie, by contrast, Rex too is Catholic and a splendid catch; the grand scene of Julia's engagement ball makes a dramatic climax, at which Sebastian disgraces himself by appearing drunk, and Charles is banished from the house.<br /><br />So did Waugh not have the trick of the big dramatic moment? On the contrary, he could manage this perfectly well, as his other novels show, but here seems to aim at something entirely different. In every case, the adjustments in the movie tend towards a more conventional drama, in terms of social tensions, personality struggles, and the cavalcade of events. Much is made, for example, of Charles' lower social status, but there is nothing of this in the book, whose characters are grace itself. Emma Thompson has a virtuoso grande dame role as Lady Marchmain, the mother of Sebastian and Julia, but the character is the book is altogether gentler; she works through persuasion, not by force of will. Things that happen in the movie like a coup de th&eacute;âtre, such as Charles coming together with Julia or Lord Marchmain returning home to die, take days or weeks in the novel. The movie is in the moment but earthbound, while Waugh has another dimension. His rhetoric is not that of a Hollywood actor; he is trying to represent the still small voice of God.<br /><br />BRIDESHEAD REVISITED (1944) is an often funny book, with satires of upper-class twits, sanctimonious hypocrites, and posing aesthetes, but it is rooted nonetheless in a basic sense of civility. Waugh's earlier books, such as [[ASIN:0316916056 PUT OUT MORE FLAGS]] (1942), were more obviously satirical and not so rooted, but you can see the author struggling to give them moral ballast. This occurs most obviously in [[ASIN:0375414207 A HANDFUL OF DUST]] (1934) where, in an attempt to resolve the frivolous immoralities of the novel, the author tacks on an ending that belongs to a different world altogether. Here, although the religious themes are introduced as a matter more of biography than belief, they are nonetheless pervasive. Compare Waugh to Graham Greene, who converted to Catholicism four years before him. Greene's fascination with sinful characters who nonetheless find salvation, as in [[ASIN:0142437972 BRIGHTON ROCK]] (1938) or [[ASIN:0142437301 THE POWER AND THE GLORY]] (1940), is an assertive statement of a doctrinal paradox; Waugh is more subtle. Indeed, it would be possible to come away from the movie believing that it was an anti-Catholic tract. And yet in the book, Lord Marchmain, Julia, and especially Sebastian in his later years as movingly described by his younger sister Cordelia, emerge as just such prodigals returned to the fold. Even the agnostic Charles appears at the end to be at least half-way towards conversion. Brilliant though the movie's final scene in the chapel was, the ending of the book goes deeper.<br /><br />So what are those universal themes I mentioned? You don't need to have been at Oxford to respond to such a fine description of the springtime struggle to define one's place in society, one's sexuality, one's talents. You don't need to have lived through a war to lament the passage of time and feel the need to honor the past even when hailing the future. You don't need to come from a noble family to recognize the importance of roots, something essential that comes through no matter what; dysfunctional though the Brideshead family may be, it is no accident that Charles is presented as being virtually without a functioning father at all, deprived of the very roots that make them who they are.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|Let me start by stating that if you watch Stardust the movie hoping that it achieves the aura of Stardust the book, you will be disappointed. That, however, is the fate of most book into movie productions. Stardust the book was magical because it is made of words. Stardust the movie is made of images and it is unrealistic to hope that it could capture the essence of the written version.<br /><br />That said, Stardust the movie has its moments.  Clare Danes makes a luminous star,  Charlie Cox a credulous young hero, and deNiro has a great time camping it up in his role as secretly gay pirate captain. Michelle Pfeiffer is less successful as the witch; either of her two crone sisters could have done better. There are more than a few problems with the story line, which, especially at the start, jumps about in a confusing manner.<br /><br />It is in its individual scenes that this movie shines. Seeing a dying prince bleed blue blood. Watching the 6 dead brothers in their ghostly throng, bearing their slashed throats and axes in the head.  The Capt. Hook - style sequences with the air ship. The fairy tale backgrounds and the gypsy wagon. The special effects, which, while not spectacular, do their job. The developing love story. It isn't perfect, but Stardust is good entertainment, fun to lose oneself in on a rainy evening. If you enjoy the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the book. It's even better.
0618680004|1.0|it comes to no surprise that these anti-religious loons are trying to convert as many people to atheism and humanism when events like 9/11 were sparked by religious fundamentalism. It is fundamentalism that is the problem, not religion itself. However, these people who have limited understanding of God seek to do damage which is not supposed to be the role of individuals but rather a collective of people who seek to prove that they are right and everyone else who is not like them is wrong. These secular fundamentalists are no different nor any better than their religious counterpart, I find it interesting how much they have in common yet they hate each other.    This war on religion should be more so focused upon the war against fundamentalism, not religion, nor God. These inspired texts have caused much conflict, no one can deny it, but they have also cause people to reach potentials never before reached. Could it be that fundamentalism is the problem being that fundamentalism is what has caused religion to be used for war and personal gain? These critics of religion should be willing to help their religious heretical counterparts in breaking down dogmatic fundamentalism. Instead they dont, they attack all of religiosity as if it was the full problem. These books and others like them are based on ignorance.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I purchased this controller to have a second controller for my PS3 to take on my friends.  It may be a small thing but ording this controller for the price it doesn't come with the USB cabel to charge the batteries.  May not be much but when it's promoted as:  \\"Can be charged at any time through the PlayStation 3 system using the controller's USB cable.\\"    It's a bit 'CHEAP' Sony can't include another USB cable for $50+  Kind of like selling a $500 Playstation with only one controller in the first place.    I haven't been impressed with the \\"Rumble\\" feature in this unit in the first.  Had metal gear solid 4 when it first came up and.  \\"Not a whole lot shakin' going on to be worth mentioning.
B00006F7S4|5.0|If you are the kind of guy that likes music equal measures Dylan and Drake,  don't mind a little grit mixed in with your smooth, and know what it means to be knocked out and unable to breathe when someone you love leaves you...well, then you will have an inkling about what kind of music Beck makes on this album, and very likely, you will love it.  This is simply the most elegantly heartbreaking break-up album by one of the most eloquent songwriters of our time.  The miracle and beauty of the album is that nothing sounds fake, precious, or pretentious--simply honest and lovely.  Beck doesn't shy away from the places that hurt when he writes.  He walks right up to the bruises and pokes them.  It hurts, but at least he knows that he can still feel.  I hope he's doing fine.
B0000041DF|2.0|I heard nothing but wonderful things about this recording, and when I finally gave in and bought the CD, I have never been more let down. Both of these concerti are favorites of mine, and I have studied the scores for both quite intimately. I also have numerous recordings of these works, but none fall as short as this one. It is definitely at the bottom of the pile.     The only thing that sets this recording apart from all other Rach 3's out there is the speed. I will give Argerich this much: she has a lot of balls to play this monster at that break-neck speed, but she just doesn't have the hands. The only recording I can find that is faster than this is Rachmaninoff's own version of it, and he had mammoth hands that could handle his unbelievable tempi.     Here is the unavoidable truth: she misses notes EVERYWHERE. How can anyone, musician or not, sit and listen to this piece, and not notice how she's slaughtering it? There are obvious mistakes throughout the piece, and it makes the piece very difficult for me, as a musician and a great lover of this piece, to listen to her. I think the absolute worst spot for me is in the last movement, after the orchestra brings back the initial tempo, when the trumpets blare the main theme, and she has her huge octave jumps. She plays an incorrect note that is so obviously wrong, and she holds the pedal over the entire bar, making the whole passage a muddled mess. It drives me crazy every time I hear it. Somewhere, Rachmaninoff is rolling over in his grave because of this recording. It's just all wrong.    Another problem I had with this piece was how separated she was from the orchestra. There were places when her ridiculous tempi were throwing the orchestra out of control. Especially in the last movement, it sounds like the orchestra and Argerich have never played together as an ensemble. It feels like they have to rush themselves to try and keep up with her. Most noticeable spots are between 0:50-2:00. Only when they play without her do they seem 100% together, and even then, they have the occasional pitch issue (flutes and oboes, that one is especially for you).    The Tchaik seems to be a bit better that the Rach, but not by much. She has fewer mistakes in this piece, though they are still apparent, and in-your-face. Her tempo for the 3rd movement is fantastic, though she again loses the orchestra in spots and her fingers stray to the wrong keys here and there. The worst spot in this whole concerto is at 14:57 in the first movement. Here we have huge orchestral chords, alternated with huge piano rolls. Her first chord is obviously wrong, and does not correct it until the third time she plays the chord. The third movement is the highlight of this CD, because you will NOT find a faster version of this movement. The listener must take into account, however, the plethora of mistakes within the first minute (the ending is quite good).    I honestly have no idea why practically every reviewer on this site thinks this recording is the shining star of the Rach 3, but it most definitely is not! If you want speed with tons of mistakes, buy this recording. Otherwise, I highly reccommend Kissin's interpretation ([[ASIN:B000003FF0 Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No.3, etc.]]). It is one of the slower interpretations, but the passion is there, and so is the technique. You could not ask for a more flawless performance (which is also live). If you want speed with perfection, but not much life, I reccommend Ashkenazy with the Royal Concertgebouw and Bernard Haitink ([[ASIN:B0000041UM Rachmaninov: The Four Piano Concertos]]). As for the Tchaik Concerto, I reccommend Lang Lang's version with Chicago ([[ASIN:B000094HLE Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn: First Piano Concertos]]). It is absolutely superb.    So if you can look past all the mistakes throughout this CD (I have never heard more in just one compact disc), feel free to buy this recording, but believe me when I say that the rating of 2 stars out of 5 is amercy-rating from me.
031606792X|1.0|I was once an obsessed Twilight saga fan. After reading Breaking Dawn, the obsession is over, the magic gone.     While reading it I kept closing the book saying \\"this is completely ridiculous!\\" I finished the other books in record time but I kept walking away from this one. I had to force myself to go back to find out the ending. Did I really want to know? Now I wish I would have had the power to withstand my morbid curiousity. It was like passing a car wreck, knowing I shouldn't look because I might see something that would emblaze a horrific image in my head. I should have kept driving, eyes straight ahead.    This book ruined the whole series for me. I doubt I will ever read them again. Sorry Stephenie...I wanted to be loyal.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|Not sure what I can add to the above reviews but I have become a huge fan of Jonny since the Walk the Line movie, bought most of his top selling Cds such as San Quentin and Folsom Prison. This DVD is the first time I have seen jonny perform live.  What can one say about John Carter Cash that has not been written before. If you like the man and his music then you will like or LOVE this DVD. Not only is it a compilation of 60 hours worth of TV wrapped into a couple of hours of June, Statler Brothers, Tennessee three, but dozens of guest stars ranging from Bob Dylan, Linda Rondstadt, Jerry Lee Lewis, a very young Eric Clapton and many more.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Crime no longer pays in Gotham City.  With the arrival of the Batman, criminals, thugs and crime bosses have found it rather hard to ply their trade.  The grip of corruption is also loosening in the city's police force.  Top it all off with the new DA, golden boy Harvey Dent, and you quickly find that a crook's wages are quickly getting poorer.<br /><br />So what's a crime boss to do?  That's easy. Eliminate the Bat.  Who's insane enough to take the job?  A heartless, maniacal, lethal and much-more-intelligent-than-he-looks villain who goes by the name on his calling card:  the Joker.  He lives by no rules and creates chaos for no other reason but to create chaos.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan picks up where his wonderful \\"Batman Begins\\" left off in \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman and delves even deeper into the psyche of the character.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also return.  Neither of them skips a beat in their respective roles as Alfred and Lucius Fox.  Cillian Murphy makes a brief (but still cocky) appearance as the Scarecrow.  Another returning face is Gary Oldman as quite possibly the most sane person in the entire film, Lt. Gordon.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes in \\"Batman Begins.\\"  I felt that Holmes' performance was the weakest in \\"Batman Begins\\" and was actually glad to see her not return in this film.  Gyllenhaal brings a much more believable performance to the screen.  She's torn between two men that she legitimately loves.  One is Bruce Wayne and the other is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).<br /><br />Eckhart hasn't received much publicity for his role in this film when compared to another newcomer, but he is just as brilliant in the role of Dent.  He's one of the more sympathetic characters in the film, and he rides an emotional rollercoaster throughout this story.<br /><br />Of course, all eyes were on Heath Ledger as the Joker.  All of the hype is true.  Ledger's performance as the Clown Prince of Crime is the most sinister and cruel performance I've ever watched on the big screen.  He makes you forget that this film is based on a comic book series that features a man in a batsuit and his boyish sidekick in red and yellow.  Ledger is simply chilling.  He's also quite hilarious in a sadistic way.  You know you shouldn't laugh at him, but you just can't help it at times.<br /><br />The film also features a number of other film and television stars in lesser roles.  Keep an eye out for the photographer (Nestor Carbonell) from \\"Just Shoot Me,\\" the geek (Anthony Michael Hall) from \\"Sixteen Candles,\\"  Julia's estranged brother (Eric Roberts, as a slimeball crime boss) and the highly underrated William Fichtner as a gun-wielding banker.<br /><br />The film is tense.  Characters are given multiple choices, most of which are lethal no matter what they decide.  There are also a number of surprises in this film.  One in particular caught me completely off guard.<br /><br />Without revealing anything else, I have to say that if you see one movie this summer (or buy one DVD within the next year), \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the film you want.  It has a very, very hard PG-13 rating for a number of good reasons.  Part of me wished that the film had gone ahead with an R-rated release, but don't let that keep you from watching this film.  It's excellent, and I highly recommend it.ince of Crime is the most sinister and cruel performance I've ever watched on the big screen.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I am a huge Coldplay fan and would rank this CD as not as good as some of their past work.      With the exception of \\"Viva La Vida\\", nothing really stirred me on this CD.    It opens well with \\"Life in Technicolor\\" and into \\"Cemeteries of London\\".  \\"Lost!\\" and \\"42\\" are OK but their previous work stirred me - some of was brilliant.    This CD gets to that level on the song \\"Viva La Vida\\" - compelling, powerful and vast.  I love it.    \\"Violet Hill\\" is good too and the video is equally good.    I liked this CD but with the exception of \\"Viva La Vida\\" it didn't move me like \\"X&Y\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" did.    Still a great band.  I still think their best work is yet to come.
0385340567|1.0|Sorry, Mr. Child, but you kind of did me in on this one.  It started with the abrupt change of the character in the last book.  Reacher became . . . different.  It wasn't just his apparent endorsement of PETA.  There were aspects of the man's person that changed.  I always felt that Reacher's character was based on things like justice, honor, concern for what is just plain right, no matter what the odds.  That started to melt away in the earlier book.      In Child's lastest work, Reacher suddenly gets involved in pushing political positions that did not seem to arise from the character, but instead came from the author.  And Reacher became a puppet.  Unfortunately for Child, I don't think he will find a lot of readers that would support his position.  And the earlier Reacher would never accept it, either.  How did he intend us to understand this?  Are we to suddenly realize that Reacher has been a closet liberal for all these years?  You lost me, Mr. Child, and I DO wonder.  How would you explain?  He was temporarily captured, programmed and possessed by aliens?  I don't think this is capable of being repaired.  And it's a sorrowful thing because he was such a fine character.    I won't recommend this book, or any book that so blatantly veers away from the character's history to become the political arm of his creator.  I mean, Child is free to do it of course, but I don't have to read his books.  And I won't.    I'm sorry for you, but I'm more sorry for me.  I'm one of the big losers here.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|With the possible exception of Deadwood - HBO's magnificent Shakespearean noir-western - Mad Men defies easy comparison with virtually any television drama ever made. While much has already been written on the program's stunning recreation of mid-century cultural/corporate atmospherics and the big swinging casualness of its fidelity is optional lifestyle, the real focus for me is Sterling Cooper's creative chieftain, Don Draper.     He is a man of compromised emotion and is quite literally as ephemeral as the Brands he champions.     Draper's life is a canard, based entirely on an identity stolen from one of his dead Korean War comrades - with his lineage, education, breeding and comportment all fabrications in the service of his assumed identity. His wife is a prop to whom he owes no allegiance - his co-workers \\"necessaries\\" in the propagation of his fraud.     His is the ultimate fantasy played out within an industry that chews it like Pez. Draper's essence is one of physical inflection married to the danger of living in one's own head - where dialogue becomes superfluous, dangerous and far too revealing. It is the program's singular pleasure to watch Jon Hamm inhabit the role with such detached earnestness as if living on the brink of detection with every breath. His is a morality play of which Deadwood's Al Swearangen could be proud - and slightly envious.    Draper is far from the only thing in Mad Men worth watching. The entire supporting cast is outstanding led by Draper's wife Betty, played by January Jones. For me however, Hamm remains the nucleus of the program and is a tour de force.    Very highly recommended!
031606792X|5.0|Like a true Twilight series fan I bought the book on the first day it came out.  I thought that it was as amazing as the three previous books (although I really didn't care for New Moon all that much).  So when I got online and read the reviews I was surprised at how amny people really didn't like it.  Okay, so maybe Bella go off too easy by getting everything that she wanted but it was still a really great book.  I guess I also didn't really like Jacob imprinting on Renesmee either.  I also think that it would have been cool if Bella had killed Jane or something like that but I was happy with the ending because Bella and Edward were together!
0061564893|5.0|1421 is a highly intriguing (and certainly controversial) book which postulates a theory that the Chinese were not only the first to \\"discover\\" the New World but had; indeed, circumnavigated the globe well before Magellan's expedition. While the author, Gavin Menzies, makes many assumptions and, at times, makes what appear to be rather wild suggestions concerning his theories, many of them do remain quite plausible.     Unlike others who have made outlandish claims as regarding early settlers in the Americas first (including the claims by one of this country's largest cults that continues to assert, in light of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that a non-existent group of ancient Israelis, the Nephites and the Lamanites are the ancestors of Native Americans), many of Menzies' intriguing ideas are capable of being further tested and examined for their veracity.     I was particularly fascinated with Menzies' (a former commander of a British submarine) use of ancient maps as the impetus for his theory. Granted, there are those that will rush to snub their noses at Menzies' ideas but certainly with further study, which is something that I believe the author would personally encourage, they will eventually be proven or discarded. Regardless, 1421 is a fascinating book and I would recommend it to anyone who might be interested in examining alternative views of history (of course, with both eyes open to test the veracity of this book).
B000021Y77|5.0|It's amazing what you'll buy when retailers sell DVDs for four bucks.  The cool thing is that you can completely trash your expectations.  Heck, I couldn't rent it twice at blockbuster for this money.  Needless to say, I jumped in with both feet and landed safely into a film I thought was pretty cool.  Let's run with Lola!!<br /><br />-DUBBA DUBBA...<br />I had to watch the dubbed version.  I started with subtitles but this is a very visual film.  The limited dialogue simply sets the stage for the physical action and reinforces the point of the film.  So, it was more important to watch the action than hear the actor's actual German voices.  Most of the dubs were fair enough accept for Lola's boy friend; \\"GODDAM# IT! HE'S GONNA KILL ME!!!  WHAAAHAAAAHAAAA!!\\".  After that scene it got better.<br /><br />-THE POINT OF THE FILM<br />Though not a completely new concept, the film revolves around the idea that one little word, act or decision will dramatically change your fate and the fate of others.  This film, though a bit overly deliberate (what, we Germans?) still managed to be unique.  I'm not even going to tell you how this is presented because that's half the fun.<br /><br />-A FILM OF FAIR QUALITY<br />I would never call this great film making.  However, it's not at all bad either.  Like the concept, the execution was fairly deliberate.  I thought this made it more fun.  The acting was at least adequate, the story was unique enough and it actually had some exciting visual dynamics without going over the top... ...most of the time.<br /><br />-JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED<br />Well the heck with that.  This film is full of stupid people.  Of course the question is never asked; \\"how could they be so stupid to begin with!\\"  I guess we're expected to roll with the premise as it was set up.  That's ok, but it certainly lurked in the back of my mind that these are not particularly good people we're investing our emotions in.  That kind of ruined the ending for me.  Possibly the dumbest thing about Lola is her unique talent which borders on being a super power; just ridiculous.<br /><br />-INTERESTING ANIMATION<br />I almost feel like I'm giving too much away by mentioning that there is animation at all.  But it's too late; there are animation sequences in this film.  They were actually visually exciting and accentuated the entire concept of the film.  It was almost like \\"Schoolhouse Rock\\" meets \\"Lizzy Maguire\\" meets \\"The Simpson's\\"; very Euro-groovy.  Please; no smart remarks about me even knowing about \\"Lizzy Maguire\\".  I do have a young daughter after all.  Anyway, I actually liked these somewhat crude but stylish interludes.<br /><br />-WAS MUSS ICH DENKEN? (What do I think?)<br />I thought it was \\"sehr gut\\".  It is actually a riveting film that has lots of action and only a little violence (mostly running, duh!).  If you like unique story telling with good production values and fair acting this might satisfy you.  The ending is a bit irksome to me for reasons I don't want to explain here for fear of spoilage.  However, it was inevitable considering the type of people we're dealing with.  I recommend watching with the dubbing due to the visual nature of the film.  I found it helpful anyway.  If you can buy it for the same price I did, all the better.  So hop on the Lola express; BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA...<br /><br />Actors....3.8 stars<br />Visuals...4.7 stars<br />Story.....5.0 stars<br />  Average...4.5 starslent which borders on being a super power; just ridiculous.    -INTERESTING ANIMATION  I almost feel like I'm giving too much away by mentioning that there is animation at all.

031606792X|2.0|Wow, such a disappointment. The first three books in this series were amazing and I couldn't wait for the finale to this series. The direction Meyers took in this book was such a 180 from the rest of the series that it ruined what was in my mind one of the best series in recent years. In trying to create an ending that pleased everyone and had all the characters happy, Meyers created a fantastically awful ending that was so unrealistic (yes I know vampires, werewolves, but just read the last one) and failed to satisfy many fans.  The best thing about these books was Bella and Edwards' relationship which stood the test of so many trials. Here their relationship takes a back seat to weird sub plots that are introduced solely to wrap up loose ends that could have been managed without taking away from the original three books. Sad to say I am one disappointed fan.
B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|So I put this on purely because I thought it would be a good laugh, you know? One of those \\"unintentionally hilarious\\" deals, like Batman and Robin or those movies they parody on Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then I discovered something I was totally not expecting. I actually like this album! That was not expected. I was expecting to, at best, get a couple laughs out of it. But I honestly liked most of it. Here's the deal, for those who didn't know. Jimbo always had a bit of crooner in him, but on several of these tracks he goes all-out with it. Not only that, but here the Doors enlisted a bunch of guys playing horns and strings to back them up. So this is a lounge album, right? Wrong! The string and horn arrangements are weird and creative and stuff! A great example is \\"Tell All the People.\\" By all means, it should be bad. Huge, over-the-top horn fanfare, strings, and crooned vocals. But it's good! The strings and horns are used in a good, atmospheric, odd, dark way. I'll admit that sometimes Jimbo's crooning makes me laugh, but not too often. The album's hit, \\"Touch Me,\\" may sound like a corny Vegas anthem at first brush. But it's not! The string arrangements are very good, the horns add punch, and Jim's vocals are first rate! Plus I love the sax solo. And the chorus. It's a great song! The horns and strings also add a lot to the wistful, menacing, and outright cool \\"Wishful Sinful,\\" which mixes a rock guitar with an oboe solo. The only song with horns I don't like (and in fact, I hate it) is \\"Runnin' Blue,\\" one of the Doors' worst songs ever. Interested in what bluegrass and soul would sound like if somebody mixed them? Awful, that's what they'd sound like. It's a tribute to the incredibly talented Otis Redding, who would probably be disgraced by such a song. Robbie Krieger sings the verses, but he can't really sing, and the only good part is the free jazz horn break. Only about half of this album has strings on it. The string-free half is a bit hit-or-miss. While I'm no fan of the weird bluegrass track \\"Easy Ride,\\" I fully endorse the menacing, underappreciated \\"Shaman's Blues,\\" the funky \\"Do It,\\" and the crawling blues \\"Wild Child.\\" And then there's the title track. God, that is some weird stuff. But it's good weird! It starts off a capella, with Jim going on about how you cannot petition the Lord with prayer. Then it moves into even stranger territory. There's a harpsichord part, a trippy tremolo keyboard part, a bouncy happy music-box part, a funky breakdown section with Jimbo talking about an acid trip, and an overdubbed Jim Morrison part. And I don't have even the faintest idea of what it's about. But it's cool! And, you know what? This album isn't that bad! Yeah, it's got strings and horns and all, but listen to it with an open mind. You might find you really like it! Bonus tracks? A couple alternate versions of \\"Touch Me,\\" and a couple genuine outtakes (\\"Whiskey, Mystics, and Men,\\" \\"Push Push,\\" \\"Who Scared You\\").While I'm no fan of the weird bluegrass track \\"Easy Ride,\\" I fully endorse the menacing, underappreciated \\"Shaman's Blues,\\" the funky \\"Do It,\\" and the crawling blues \\"Wild Child.\\" And then there's the title track.

1400063515|2.0|I got interested in this book in part because the topic interested me and in part because I have seen far too many random people including boston cab drivers and random passerby reading this book. I am uncertain why this book ever caught on, as it is written without any style and with long rambling bits as well as poorly executed stylistic techniques. It seems to me at least, that the success of this book is in and of itself a very negative black swan.    First, I want to take intellectual umbrage with some of the events Mr. Taleb describes as unpredictable. The book got of to a bad start by immediately sighting 9-11 as an unpredictable event. Unfortunately, this is clearly not the factual case as there were many precedents in the realm of plane high jackings and much evidence including the bin laden determined to strike the U.S memo of August 2001 to suggest an imminent attack. The problems with our intelligence communities were quite many including information sharing flaws and execution errors especially in collaboration, but the threats we faced were never completely unpredictable. Of course, Taleb is correct when he says that conventional thinking was at fault for many of our intelligence mistakes, however, the problem at least in regard to national security ( a field Taleb claims to respect later in the book) is that we mostly deal with limited resources to respond to near infinite quantities of threats. Moreover, the conventional and probable ( the assassination of JFK in Dallas) has just as much impact as the highly improbable. This is not exactly the black swan situation Taleb speaks of and it seems that at least when it comes to policy direction, his theory is lacking.    Stylistically, this book is filled with poor choices such as the french baiting so in vogue when this book came out which now is just utterly irritating, the use of hypothetical or imaginary cases rather than interesting real world example, the continuous referral back to past chapters through the use of their numbers, as if Taleb expects his tome to be judiciously memorized, a curious portion in which Taleb practically gushes about specific philosophers or mathematicians such as mandelbrot ( very awkward) and the continuous assertions of the author that he is different and unique from everyone around. The content of this book gets lost in a muddled layer of arrogance and repetition.  The point of this book could much more easily be told with concrete examples and less narcissism and redundancy.
B00011F5DK|4.0|This is a great game for kids to hone their spacial relationship understanding and reasoning skills, and equally as fun for adults to strategize moves against their oponents in hopes of blocking as many pieces as possible from being laid down on the board. Game is missing a warning sticker...Caution: Blokus Is Addictive.  Lot's of fun. Quick  20-30 minute games. Definitely recommend.
B000022TSY|4.0|I love the bikes in the movie. The special feature w/ the interviews of the actors was really interesting.

B00000ILDF|4.0|We really enjoy this movie Also like that we got the item as soon as we could
0312330537|3.0|Seems to me the author did himself and the audiance a disservice by not making this a memoir--and you can be certain of one thing: it would have clearly been one hell of a powerful memoir.    As it stands, the first two-thirds, as stated, are gripping and believable; the trouble is, for me, when he gets into all the mafia nonsense. Some of the twists and turns are far-fetched and just plain ridiculous (and comes across as scenes right out of the Godfather--a film that is way overrated, by the way.)    Some, not all, of the philosophizing is a nuisance; and then you've got this mafia head who sort of comes across like a Don Corleone  immitation (and that struck me as total B.S.; you've got the gang wars, more B.S.,and so on--and it really wasn't necessary.)    For the life of me, I don't get why the writer had to turn the incredible ordeal and journey he'd lived through into this (during last third of the book) screwie soap-opera type of tale. It boggles the mind.    On the other hand, sadly I do know: pot-boilers (sometimes) sell better than memoirs. It still doesn't lessen the sadness for me, because the book is absolutely brilliant in places and is proof the writer has talent and could have stayed clear of the soap opera shananigans.    The book deserves an honorable *** & 1/2 stars, only there is no way to do it with this system that amazon has going.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|OMJ!!  God, I could listen to this over and over again.  All the songs are fantastic!  My favorite is Video Girl!  But anyway, if you liked their last CD then YOU have to buy this album!!  IT IS AWESOME!!<br />AND FOR YOU PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THE JOBROS!  YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!
B001DXS4E2|4.0|I really do love Holiday Inn. Fred Astaire had trouble finding the right vehicle for himself for a few years after he split with Ginger Rogers, IMHO. Usually, he was the best thing going in the films he chose right after that period until he hit his stride again over at MGM. In some cases, he was the only thing going. However, this film is very good. He and Crosby are great together and the storyline is compelling with a very Christmas feeling about it even though it covers the holidays of the entire year. It's the perfect film for the holiday season, plus the director of the film is Mark Sandrich, the same director who did such a good job with the Astaire and Rogers films over at RKO in the 1930's.<br /><br />However, the only thing new to this edition is a colorized version, a soundtrack CD, and a special on making the colorized version. I suggest that [[ASIN:B000I0QL82 Holiday Inn (Special Edition)]] is a better buy. It has all of the featurettes and the exact same commentary. I suggest Universal should look around their vaults at all of the pre-1949 Paramount films that it owns as well as its own classics not yet on DVD, and stop double and triple dipping the same old selection of classic films every couple of years. My four star rating is arrived at as follows:<br /><br />5 stars for the film<br />3 stars for the value when compared with the Special Edition<br /><br />Average = 4 stars
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I saw Sixx AM at CrueFest and they were great.  I immediately bought both the soundtrack and book by Nikki Sixx.  Both are awesome!  Their songs have so much meaning to them!
031606792X|5.0|I loved the book.  In fact I love the whole series.  Twilight will always hands down be my favorite out of the series, but I do love the other 3 books as well.  And this is coming from a 34 yr old.  Thanks Stephenie for the wonderful adventure!

B000301YY8|5.0|You may buy the CD for one song, but you are treated to enjoying the entire CD! It's a shame more of the songs aren't circulating amongst the public. I bought it because I love his music! When I played it at the business I manage, customers and co-workers loved it, and HAD TO KNOW WHO AND WHAT IT WAS. Nuff said.
0380713802|4.0|Reading Neither Here Nor There made me think that I won't die happy if I don't get to see Capri, and I determined that there were several other cities I don't ever wish to visit.  I also learned that a certain brand of travelers' checks is terrible, and I won't be using them in this lifetime.<br /><br />It is interesting to read this book in it's Communist-era, pre-Euro context.  Empty shops in Bulgaria and discussion of purchasing things with dinars and schillings was very interesting.  Unfortunately, reading the book even as I did, spreading the chapters out over several days, I still got that \\"If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium\\" feeling.  I began to lose track of where Bill saw the beautiful sunset, or where his pocket was picked.<br /><br />I was also disappointed by Bryson's alarming views towards animals and cavalier comments about hating them and wanting them killed.  Dogs hate him, and this fact has provided much humor in his writing over the years, but the tangents he went on regarding his loathing of companion animals were over the top and distinctly unfunny.  So was his anti-Arabic rant during one of his many visits to queues for financial situations.  I may be more sensitive to such things in light of recent world events, as comments about the guttural nature of German language or the expense of traveling in Switzerland didn't bother me, but this did.<br /><br />The funniest anecdotes were the ones Bryson shared about his previous travels through Europe with his friend Katz.  Katz provided a hugely politically-incorrect thread of humor in the book, and at times I thought he would have made a more interesting traveling companion.  Heresy, I know.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very glad I read the book, and I got many laughs out of it, but it was no Walk in the Woods.
B000ULQV0W|1.0|Dear Sean Penn,<br />  I know that this movie is set in the time of grunge's uprising of muddy guitar tones and lyrics crafted of the Fathers of the North Western Baritone Teenaged Angst, but really?  Eddie Vedder?  There was more around that you could have chosen, maybe someone who evolved from their flanneled past.  There has been a near twenty year span since then.  Look how far you have come from lovable teen to what you have become now.<br /><br />Spicoli, this was a great film, but there was so much more that you could have made better, if you would have taken a little more time.  Emile Hirsch should not have played McCandless, to whom he brought a body, but no justice in his portrayal.  He acts too naive and looks too green to portray a tramp of the road for over two years.  Maybe you should have thought about that, I Am Sam.  I have no suggestion for you, and am terribly sorry that I dont, however.  But dont get me wrong, I did enjoy your movie.  I just thought you could have made it better.<br /><br />Sir, on your next film in which you are behind the camera, please investigate in a little more musical taste than that of the diluted, choking voice of a 43 man who's career derives off of rock and roll's distasteful past.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />MrFisette
0385340990|5.0|This is one of the better books I've read in the past five or six years.  At parts it had me chuckling to myself, at others I laughed out loud, and at a few I sobbed.  Be prepared to have an up and down relationship with this book and come away amazed and utterly delighted.<br />Wish I could fly to Guernsey right this minute!
0060005696|5.0|The unease that has been plaguing me for years now -- I call it \\"Mall Malaise,\\" finally has scientific basis! It appears to be true - instead of choice bringing more happiness, it actually can frustrate and depress us when taken to the extreme.    Schwartz's easy-to-read analysis of the pluses and minuses of choice, coupled with scientific/psychological studies on why we feel as we do, will help a generation of overachievers and overconsumers find peace in the midst of plenty.    My favorite part -- instead of just explaining the phenomenon, Schwartz provides suggestions on how to mitigate the negative effects of too much choice.     I feel better already.
0385340567|4.0|When it comes down to it, Nothing to Lose is not the greatest Jack Reacher novel Lee Child has written. However, it certainly isn't bad. I was a bit turned off when I got my copy in the mail and checked the Amazon reviews to see the slew of 1-star reviews that Child has gotten this time around. However, the negative reviews are ridiculous. I was taken completely by surprise at the sheer number of Reacher fans that really identified with his \\"politics\\" and that this novel totally broke that illusion for them. Where have we EVER gotten a glimpse of Reacher's political views? Child leaves so much of Reacher's character to the imagination, that most people read \\"ex-military police\\" and see \\"will do anything for his country no matter the cost.\\" It is frustrating to see an endless brigade of 1-star reviews for a novel that isn't poorly written or in bad taste - it just happens to take a stance on an unpopular war that rests a bit on the liberal side. The blasphemy in question amounts to LITERALLY a page and a half of Reacher talking, and somehow Child has jumped the shark with this novel.<br /><br />People need to just grow up. Lee Child is a fantastic novelist, and consistently puts out entertaining thrillers that read like action flicks. Nothing to Lose, while not amazing, is a wholly adequate Reacher novel, and it houses in its pages one of the best bar fights Reacher has been in since Echo Burning. Don't pass on this novel for a page and a half of liberal ideas - give it a whirl. It's not his best but it's damned entertaining, and don't let the naysayers tell you otherwise.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I love this movie, and the copy I ordered just arrived from Amazon.  The case was opened, however.  It wasn't wrapped in the hard-to-open plastic sheeting, and there wasn't any security tape on the case.  In other words, it just opened right up.<br />I'm concerned that this might be a used copy and that I might be missing some printed material.  The only items in the case besides the two discs were the plain white piece of carboard with the security sticker, and an ad for TCM movies.<br />Can any of you who purchased this tell me if I'm missing anything, such as a scene selection card or booklet or anything?<br />Thanks!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is a mix of Madonna's roots in dance pop with a little street edge.  Some of the tracks in the middle of the album depart from this and frankly seem a little out of place, but overall it is fantastic.
B000059H98|5.0|This campy cult classic keeps on delivering. Maybe parts of the sound track are stuck in the mid-90s. Despite that, the after-the-crash survivalism (a la Mad Max or Resident Evil), the evil corporate lords, and the over-the top goofiness all remain as fresh as Tank Girl's mouth.<br /><br />The plot? Well, it doesn't spoil anything to say that the good guys win in the end. This movie isn't about its plot. Instead, it shows the power of brashness in its purest known form. Other high points include every change of costume (seemingly every scene), the \\"pimp my ride\\" approach her tank, and the conversion of a mousy mechanic into gun-slinging Jet Girl.<br /><br />More than any other comic adaptation, this clings to its roots in pulp-paper print. The characters all offer the depth of the printed page they came from, true, but making everything else bigger, brighter, and ballsier than life forgives any flaws. Then the cuts from actual comic book scenes (or in the style) remind us that this was never meant to be taken seriously. On the other hand, goofiness on this scale can't come from a casual effort - this is absolutely serious light-hearted goofing.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0930289234|5.0|I'll confess something right away: I'm NOT a comic book fan. I've never really read individual comic books or followed characters thru yrs of changes, variations, versions, etc. I've always been more interested in graphic novels & Watchmen was one of the 1st I ever read. This isn't a comic book series in the traditional sense; it's a complete story with characters that seem real, the type of people who could exist even in our world. There's a lot of buzz about the film coming out early next yr but I predict that 10 yrs from now, MORE people will be reading & re-reading this book than will be watching the film on DVD or it's successor formats.
031606792X|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews!  I just finished Breaking Dawn last night and I am completely happy with it.  Maybe this has something to do with the fact that I am the last person on Earth to start this series and I just devoured all four books in the saga over the last 2 weeks?  I loved that Ms. Meyer chose to give Jacob his own chapter - it was fun to hear his voice and know everything he was thinking (and I cannot WAIT for Edward's book to come out).  Don't buy into the negativity - the book has it all.  It is an amazing end to the saga.
0312427999|5.0|This is one of those books that makes you wonder when your brain went on vacation. I've been aware of corporatization and globalization for many years, but this book really helped me connect the dots. If you thought the neocons were conspiring against you, you were right. Read this book, then get angry and get even.

B00005JOHC|5.0|I watch this on TV whenever it's broadcast. This is one series that just hooks you in and you can't resist it.    I wanted to especially see the extras on this set. Since others have told you pretty much which episodes are included, I'll go into a couple of the extras found on disc 4.    One is a \\"tour\\" of the set with Angus (Jake). While less than 10 minutes long, it's still interesting as you get to see what exactly is around each corner on the set. What exactly IS at the top of the stairs? Is the house actually on the beach? What's around that corner in the kitchen were Berta usually goes or comes out of?     Another extra is about 6 minutes of outtakes with some of the bloopers made during the recording of the series. Even though it's relatively short, it's a lot of fun to watch as each star makes his or her fair share of blunders.     There's one other extra where there is a very good history of the series and how it developed. Is Charlie and Alan's \\"Mom\\" REALLY that grumpy in real life? How about Berta? How did they settle on hiring the stars to fit the parts? Was Rose originally to be a recurring role?    Needless to say, the episodes are great in this set, and the extras definitely add to the fun.
1592332803|3.0|This cookbook is useful to me in several ways, but the constant drum beat of egg replacer and vegan butter just drowns out everything for me.  I must admit I was sorely disappointed.  And what's up with all that \\"all purpose flour\\"??  Looks more like a capitalistic venture than a truly vegan cookbook.  Why cannot we have a cookbook that uses wholewheat pastry flour for cookies (for instance), for heaven's sake?  I guess this was written for people just jumping onto the health bandwagon via the cookie department, but it was not that great for me.  I have to re-create any recipe by figuring out how to avoid all those \\"1/2 cups of vegan butter\\" and using whole grains--what a drag.  I do use Earth Balance, but not by the cupful!  Puh-leeze!!
B00004NJJQ|5.0|I got turned on to UFO by the radio friendly \\"Too Hot to Handle\\" and seeing a different version of the band open for Ozzy way back in '82 (Randy Rhoades last tour if anyone remembers!). I thought the band was tight and I dug a little deeper and I am glad I did! \\"Phenomenon\\" is one awsome audio display on guitar star Michael Schenkers love and ownership of 6 electrified strings.<br /><br />I've got two faves here, and they are probably a lot of other peoples faves also. \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" starts with a melancholy riff, a sad picked minor chord over which a second guitar moans in emotional turmoil. The bass and drums kick in with a hard beat that singer Phil Mogg sings what  could be blues lyrics over. Pissed, maybe a little boozy and self pitying is the mood \\"Doctor.Doctor\\" puts me, but it is a great rocker with fine twin leads and perfect drumming.<br /><br />\\"Rock Bottom\\" is enough to make most would be Guitar Hero clowns opt for clarinet lessons and the glee club. If you don't like the main riff UFO built this song around, give it a couple of minutes- the song goes into one of the coolest hard rock bridges anywhere and then several minute solo that builds from mellow rhythym picking and single note wails to one of the most fret mauling shows of rock n roll force ever recorded. Schenker makes an excellent and stylish transition from the \\"cool down\\" flick your lighters/sip your beer segment of \\"Rock Bottom\\" and does something amazing. You have got to hear it!<br /><br />Michael Schenker won't play in the U.S anymore and it's disappointing. But the great sounds he made with UFO back in 73 are permanent and in my book HISTORICAL in their rocking greatness...
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Just had my first listen and I think this is a great album.  MGMT has a great sound.  NewWaveGlamRock is back MGMT!
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|I know a lot of folks never thought Deep Purple was the same after the departure of Ian Gillan. I am one of few that actually believe they were better and that \\"Burn\\" was the bands actual peak period, before sliding into trash with \\"Stormbringer\\" and then recouping with the new life Tommy Bolin brought to the band for their finale \\"Come Taste the Band\\".    Where does \\"Burn\\" fit in? The album was a new direction for the band, Blackmore had wanted to work with Paul Rodgers (Free/Bad Company) and it's easy to hear the similar vocal stylings of Rogers and new singer David Coverdale. Add some good bass playing and a man who can hit the high notes, Glenn Hughes and you've got a whole new sound, something very different from the classic based, post psychedelic, pre-metal sounds of \\"Machine Head\\" or \\"In Rock\\".      Saying this, the opening title track does have a classical influence in the guitar and keyboard solos, but the rest of the song is a rolling thunder blitz of hammer off guitar riffs, pounding Ian Paice drumming and great shared vocals from Hughes and Coverdale. Other standouts are \\"Sail Away\\", a cool mutated blues riff over a lazy heavy rhythym and crying guitar from Blackmore;\\"You Fool No One\\" a riff cool enough for Blackmore to recycle on the first Rainbow album with more excellent dual vocal harmonizing and a percussive keyboard and cowbell(!) sound that rings distant echoes of Yes or Santana; and \\"Mistreated\\" a guitar showcase for Blackmore and a vocal proving ground for Coverdale. Most excellent!!    The rest of the album is bluesy rock thumpers, the lone dud on the disc is \\"A2000\\" a weird synth closer that may have been forgiven if it was placed AHEAD of the first number, as Purple was famous for opening salvos like that on \\"Speed King\\" and while playing live. It's a great album and a shame this version of the band hasn't played together since 1975...
B000002OZY|5.0|A clinical and seminal meditation on alienation, popularity-seeking, and the decline of Western man encased in a rock opera about a handicapped boy. Albert Einstein spoke of his own \\"retarded\\" youth, being withdrawn from the world, and how that aided him in opening new vistas in science. \\"Tommy\\" isn't so fortunate.   \\"Amazing Journey\\" shows the advantage of Tommy's \\"retardation\\" yet shadows of \\"normalcy\\" lurk. Pete Townshend's medicinal lyrics bring to mind the Christian sentiment that only one with a child's disposition can enter the Kingdom of G-d.   \\"Ten years old   With thoughts as bold as thought can be   Loving life and becoming wise   In simplicity     Sickness will surely take the mind   Where minds can't usually go   Come on the amazing journey   And learn all you should know...\\"     Tommy's infirmities are an opportunity for his family and others to practice compassion. The boy is a living embodiment of \\"The Other\\" as found in the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. Tommy's line of \\"See me, feel me, touch me, heal me\\" (and, Levinas might have added, \\"...in order for both to be healed.\\") is the invitation to caring. The invitation is ignored.   The boy's path to \\"normalcy\\" opens when he becomes a \\"Pinball Wizard.\\" Pinball reflects Tommy's upbringing, being bounced from one relative to another, one bad experience to the next. Townshend is also opening a window into the culture of games and entertainment and how that is held out by the mass media as the most desirable escape from poverty and isolation for Britain's lower classes. Soccer mania would be the real-life equivalent in today's Europe.   Modern medicine intervenes and, in short order, Tommy is wallowing in celebrity, laziness, and profligacy. Worse, he uses his new circumstances to entice others into the nihilism that Anglo-American capitalism and social democracy abet.   From \\"Welcome\\": \\"Come to my house, be one of the comfortable people...\\"   \\"I'm Free\\" gives us a stark picture of how the worst get on top (to borrow a phrase from F.A. Hayek's \\"The Road to Serfdom\\") -   \\"If I told you what it takes to reach the highest high,   You'd laugh and say `Nothing's that simple...' `'     Ten years later \\"Dallas\\" soap opera villain J.R. Ewing would state it more plainly - \\"Once you give up integrity the rest is a piece of cake.\\"     \\"Tommy\\" was released in 1969, a time of great confusion about man's individual and social responsibilities (things haven't gotten much clearer since). The Who's music penetrates to the reality of an anarchy of ever-increasing individual rights (read: demands) and unchecked government leading to loss of social cohesion amid waning family, school, and neighborhood affections. This, in turn, breeds popularity seeking as the most attractive island in the rising tide of despair. Fellow Brits Pink Floyd would touch on this in \\"The Wall\\" a decade after Townshend.   Is there a better way out? The Who echoes Oswald Spengler in showing that there is. Spengler's \\"The Decline of the West\\" (first published in the 1920s; interestingly, the time line of \\"Tommy\\" begins around 1921) likened cultures and civilizations to life patterns, calling them \\"organic.\\" While holding civilization will move in the direction of its destiny, Spengler advised people to discern the direction of movement and contribute positively to it. Townshend and his bandmates did that in \\"Tommy.\\"   In reckoning outcomes, the workings of the human body, with its voluntary and involuntary organs, are an apt metaphor. How we consciously react and govern ourselves are the voluntary muscles (thus the importance of individual character). Yet some choices and our surroundings impact us in ways of which we are not aware.   The final words of \\"Tommy\\" remind us of the importance our individual actions have on others and the social fabric. The mountain imagery remind us of the biblical Moses, the servant of G-d; the early Israelites, and the Ten Commandments, holding out hope that the door swings both ways between the great society (not to be confused with LBJ's version) and the sick society.   \\"Listening to you I get the music   Gazing at you I get the heat   Following you I climb the mountain   I get excitement at your feet   Right behind you I see the millions   On you I see the glory   From you I get opinions   From you I get the story.\\"
B000000JO3|5.0|It might sound cliche, but yeah, this album changed my life. Until I bought this (a couple months ago) I hadn't really given old-school punk or hardcore much of a fair shot. I was never impressed with the music, and the lyrics were always too immature and self-centered. This was probably the first real hardcore album I bought, and I only bought it because so many people were saying that I had to hear it. They were right. This album totally changed my opinion on older punk and helped introduce me to what are now some of my favorite bands (namely, Discharge). I found that I could completely relate to what Ian was talking about and the whole album is incredibly inspiring. The lyrics are intelligent, the music is high energy, and the songs are really catchy. The best on the album are, in my opinion, \\"In My Eyes\\", \\"Guilty of Being White\\", and \\"Minor Threat\\". But there isn't any song on here that I would really say is bad, some just don't quite stand up to the very best. Essential for anyone who wants to get into this style.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|These dvd's let you sit back and enjoy the good old days of movies. Wonderful memories!
B000001DYD|5.0|I usually listen to male-fronted metal, but PJ Harvey is the exception. This was my first album of hers and it just blew me away. Her vocals are the exact opposite of everything I usually hate about female vocals. Her voice sounds imperfect, cracking with emotion and strain. Her lyrics are intelligent and just hit me so hard with their relevancy. I'd suggest this album to anyone even remotely interested in her music, because it's probably my favorite album of hers.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Loved it. I've read a few reviews of this flick where a lot of nitpicking about time travel and so forth is going on. Hey peeps...it's \\"Science Fiction\\" NOT science fact. I read a quote long ago (can't remember where) that recommended this: \\"Suspend your disbelief and cherish the illusion\\". I hope they keep making SG1 movies forever (I love you RDA + BB). Nuff said...
B0015AARJI|4.0|Good controller, it has rumble and sixaxis and its chunkier, which feels better. I prefered over the normal sixaxis.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Everything about this album flows.  Conceptually, musically, instrumentally, vocally, emotionally - it's just a tour de force from the frozen yonder.  Gorgeous, just gorgeous.  Don't wait, buy now.
B0018TLRTU|4.0|There is 13 video clips on this CD/DVD. For example Hot in the City, Rebel yell, Dancing with myself and so on. The video quality on a few of the clips could be better. But I put this down to time when they were recorded back in the early 1980s.   The DVD format is NTSC not PAL, this may or may not be a problem. Other then that there is a good number of his songs on this best of collection.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie off the bat. But the ultimate edition has different versions with bonus footage! It is definitely \\"icing on the cake\\" as they say. So with the bargain you're getting here at Amazon, do yourself a favor and pick this up today!

031606792X|5.0|Well this book was AMAZING and great. Despite what some people said about how bad this book is it was GREAT. I'm not going to lie this book deserves the good 5 star review. Some people probably don't like this book, for they're team Jacob. Sorry, but this book is and was amazing.
031606792X|5.0|I thought this was a great ending to a great series!!  Yes, it was a perfect ending and Bella got everything she wanted, a little unrealistic, yes...but it's FICTION!!  I don't know about the rest of the population, but I read fiction to escape reality and not dwell on life's problems.  It never ends happily every after in real life so it's nice to see a happy ending for the characters I've grown to love in this series.    I also loved 'The Host' and am now forever a Meyer fan!
B0018M6J90|4.0|A really marvelous film with superb performances from Frances Frances McDormand, and Amy Adams, a strong storyline, beautiful cinematography, and creatively-done credits. If this story doesn't touch you and make you simile, you need to stop watching movies altogether - you are not human enough for such a task. This movie has all of the flair of an old Hollywood classic and all of the color and vibrancy that modern cinema can provide.
031606792X|5.0|SPOILER WARNING!  To start out with, I'm actually surprised that so many people disliked this book to the extent that they did. I also disliked it, but not as much as others have been reporting. I'd give it a 4.5/5 stars. The things I really liked was that first, the editing either got much better or I'm losing my ability to pick out poor grammar. It seemed like I'd catch an error maybe every 25 - 30 pages rather than every 2 - 3 pages. I think there was only one sentence I had to re-read once for clarity. I don't believe there was one misplaced modifier.    Elements in the book that I liked is that the pace of the book felt much different and I enjoyed it as it had me more on the edge of my seat with the action rather than just the lovey dovey story. I think of all the books, because this encompassed so many things, I think that it was the most accessible to men and women. I was hoping that Stephanie Meyer would kill off one of the main characters, but the tension as it built as I tried to figure out which one was going to die and then found out that no one actually did was actually just as satisfying to me. The experience of the book was more important to me than the outcome. And the very ending when Bella was able to let down her guard for Edward to read her mind was something I was really wanting to happen sometime so that was very satisfying. I think my favorite part, as far as the language goes, was the part where Bella walked down the stairs to Edward during the wedding.    Stuff I really could have done without:  Being a \\"team Edward\\" fan, I had a knee-jerk reaction that Jacob's point of view was kinda dumb. Later on I realized that it really was necessary, though, as it enhanced the understanding of all the characters and I think it gave some props to the \\"team Jacob\\" fans out there, so it didn't bother me by the end of the section.     I definitely could have done without violent vampire sex, but that's just me.    As a whole I enjoyed the book and found it a satisfying ending. I would have liked it if Edward had died or something really romantic like that, but the ending actually didn't disappoint and I felt that the book came to a wholesome conclusion.

031606792X|4.0|To all who are complaining about the Anti-feminism tone in the book or the too neat happy ending, what did you expect? This is a fantasy vampire love story written for teens. It is obviously not literature that will be studied in English classes, but that's not why we read it. It has an exciting storyline and interesting characters that draw you in to this fantasy world. I personally loved the book and was happy to get the happy ending that Stephenie Meyer had promised.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Imagine if you settled down for a nice warm bath and it was so relaxing that you fell asleep.  You startle awake and look around the bathroom.  Something feels wrong.  You can't remember how you got there and you don't know who you are anymore.  There's a strange looking syringe on the ground, so maybe this is drug related.  That doesn't really explain the amnesia logically though.  This all sounds unbelievable doesn't it?  Impossible even.  However, this is precisely what happened to John Murdoch (played by Rufus Sewell) and that's how \\"Dark City\\" opens.<br /><br />Part of me doesn't want to say anymore about this film and the other part wants to tell you all about it.  This movie truly is a psychological thriller with a sci-fi horror twist.  (If you understand the relation of that line to Aqua Teen Hunger Force, you will be amused.)  I actually can't think of a better way to lay it out.  The viewer is essentially brought into a very strange world, but it looks very close to, say, a 1920's setting.  Something feels very amiss throughout the whole movie and the viewer is left to unravel the mysteries with John.  In this guise the movie is very expertly written because we never learn something too soon.  All we know is that something feels off in this world and when everything is revealed it's quite shocking.<br /><br />The film concept doesn't end there.  It's actually a very deep film and if you pay attention to what's going on it asks very human philosophical questions.  Such as if faced with extinction what would humanity do?  What kind of atrocities could be committed in order to save our race?  While the film doesn't precisely answer these questions it does help us understand the antagonists called The Strangers.<br /><br />Despite the strong performances from Rufus Sewell and Jennifer Connely (John's love interest), I think that Keifer Sutherland's performance was the most impressive.  He played sort of the mad scientist kind of role.  I realize this film came out in 1998, long before Keifer was the surefooted star of 24, but to view this in retrospect shows how strong of an actor he really is.  Not only does he play the role of mad scientist kind of character, but he's also overly nervous and exhibits a limp.  I just felt this was kind of out of the norm for Keifer and was impressed that he pulled this off so convincingly.  It's also strange that I mention this because he was not the main star of the film, which was Rufus Sewell.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film doesn't answer all the mysterious questions that came to my mind, but that's okay.  You don't need all questions answered in a story all the time.  The film is so strong and so well written that these details can easily be overlooked as well.  If you like delving into bizarre worlds with a science fiction element then this is definitely a movie to watch.  I picked this up on a whim because it had an interesting cast and an intriguing synopsis.  I was blown away, probably by the sheer fact I had no idea what to expect from this film.  Amidst all this complexity it maintains a very strong and dark 1920's mystery feel as well.  It's a very bizarre film, but also very well done in my opinion.  If you are summarily intrigued by this then I do recommend you give this a viewing.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5e Keifer was the surefooted star of 24, but to view this in retrospect shows how strong of an actor he really is.

B00009W0U4|2.0|This film reminded me of Man Bites Dog, another film that made me feel sick.  But this is possibly worse than MBD. Irreversible is gimmicky pretentious camera work and oppressive soundtrack which makes you want to throw up, and an unnecessarily long rape scene which is only one of the scenes of sordid and sickening violence. There is something peculiarly poignant about how it ends, but it is not enough to redeem the film. Monica Belluci is amazing, especially in the play of emotions over her pregnancy test. But again, not enough to redeem a film that is essentially designed to shock and disturb. Life can be pretty grim as it is without even grimmer fiction thrown in for good measure. It may be worth seeing this once for academic interest, but only just. If you want to be kind to yourself, don't (it is not going to enrich your life).
0525950079|4.0|I started reading the book some weeks ago and I have just reached its half.<br />The style is a lot like The Pillars of the Earth and, actually, most of the book is. More than a sequel,as they have tried to sell it, it sometimes looks like a 'repetition' of many episodes of the previous book, which in fact has nothing to do with this one--neither the characters nor the story.<br />In any case, I am quite enjoying reading the book and I do really like it, though sometimes the lack of originality is remarkable.

B0017I1FNK|4.0|I loved this CD.<br />As if there was any chance that I would not.<br /><br />The reason that I gave it 4 stars<br />is because I am comparing it to her<br />other collections of songs released<br />over the decades, on the EH scale<br />if you will. Very few, if any, other<br />folk musicians can even qualify to<br />be rated on the EH scale.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a sort of return<br />to somewhat traditional Americanish<br />folk music,<br />but I'm not disappointed because<br />she is particularly good at that<br />whatever-you-call-it type music.<br />What am I saying ?!!! She's the best.<br />The truth is, after all this time,<br />one might as well call it<br />Emmylou Harris music. She owns it.<br /><br />You will hear and like a number of songs<br />written by herself<br />and other great song writers.<br />And, as usual, she is accompanied<br />by the best of the best of musicians.<br /><br />The cardboard packaging is pretty lame.<br /><br />It's a new Emmylou Harris album!!!<br />Get it and listen to it alot!!!

0385333846|5.0|This is a great book and an interesting insight into Kurt's world.  The long awaited Dresden Novel that he claimed to be working on for so many years.  I didn't find it funny, but sobering.  There are many many great quotes to be taken from it and I'm sure they have been taken many times. It is worth reading for it's history alone, but deeper still there are tidbits of meaning and reality for the reader.  The ending is a bit different than I would have expected, but I really enjoyed it, and consumed it in less than a day ( as I did also, with Mother Night).  It is sobering and somber, but a great book, either way.  It deserves it ranking with the top 100 novels of all time, and should be allowed in High Schools as required reading with or without the cussing.  I am happy to have added it to my collection.  But sad that there will not be more books like it.
B000067CPX|2.0|I've been a RHCP fan since their debut. As such, I'm much a fan of the style of music they pioneered in the 1980's and played on their early efforts, even as late as 1995's One Hot Minute. I faithfully bought By The Way right when it came out, as a loyal RHCP fan. Boy.... What a let down. Where, uh, is the \\"red hot?\\" The band took the musical idea behind \\"Otherside\\" from Californication (probably the most annoying song on that album) and created a whole album of  \\"Otherside\\" remixes and reworkings. Well, almost. There are maybe 4 or 5 tracks here that are listenable. One or two of them are actually really good. But the rest is just slow, boring, mostly acoustical stuff that lacks energy or drive. They should have changed their name for this album to the Tired Chili Peppers. Or maybe the Medium Mild Chili Peppers.  Or maybe the Weak Pepperoncinis. Or.... You get the idea. It actually makes me upset to see all these kids that are \\"hardcore RHCP fans\\" and their only exposure to the band is By the Way and Californication. These people have no idea what the RHCP are about. It's appalling. \\"OMG 'BY THE WAY' IS SOOOOO COOL DOOD OMG1!!!!!!!!!11!! RHCP ROCKS$%#$#@!!\\" Umm, yeah. Right. Let's go rock out to \\"The Zephyr Song\\" together.     The good: \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" are far and away the best tracks on the record and are actually really good. The band must have decided not to take any downers the day they wrote those. Too bad they didn't make that decision for the rest of the album sessions. The title track tries to be good, and succeeds at times, but it all comes crashing down for the awful chorus.    The bad, boring, bland: Everything else. The only reason this album didn't earn 1 star is because of the two tracks mentioned above. There are a few tracks that actually make you want to throw away your *stereo*, they're THAT BAD.    \\"By the Way\\" singlehandedly turned me off of all future RHCP efforts. To this day I haven't listened to Stadium Arcadiumfor fear I may do something rash. If you're a teen punk who's music-listening life started in 2001 or later, do yourself a favor and go buy the Red Hot Chili Pepper's debut album (self-titled), \\"Freaky Styley\\", \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\", and hell even \\"Mother's Milk\\" and find out what the Red Hot Chili Peppers are REALLY all about.    On the other hand, this is a great album to listen to if you want to go to sleep. Red Hot Chili Pepper's worst effort of their 24-year career.

0671027344|2.0|When I picked this book up,  I expected a book to identify with.  However,  as I read the story,  this was not the case.  A majority of the book is talking about what kind of music Charlie likes,  what kind of drugs he takes,  or how much fun he has at the Rocky Horror show. I can't count how many times he goes to it and watches the same thing.  As I wasn't interested in any of this topics the book didn't particularly give me any message.     There was one interesting twist in this book.  The background information to the twist makes it believable,  and the way it is revealed is brilliant.  Aside from that,  theres not much good to say about this book.
031606792X|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite book in the series after \\"Twilight\\". I'm really surprised at the criticism the book is receiving. I noticed in particular that there is criticm related to how neatly the saga ended. Ultimately, Bella and Edward have not had the easiest time being together. They certainly had to go though their faire share of difficulties to get to the point where they could live happily ever after. Don't they deserve their happy ending?
031606792X|3.0|Breaking dawn is an addictive page turner just like the previous books.  The plot feels a little bit rushed.  This is to be expected,  since this is the last book of the series.  At times you are a little be disconcerted because of the fast pace of the events.  At other times you are reading and waiting for the plot to speed up a little.  One character that I have grown to like in this book is Jacob.  His character becomes more easy to understand and likeable.  I've never been a big fan of Bella.  She has always been the oposite of me in a way.  However,  in this book sometimes she's the opposite of herself.  Here is an example from the book.  ****Spoilers ****            \\"I knew now that I could deal with anything except Renessme's death.\\"  Then some 20 pages later.  \\"If Edward were to die so would I.\\"  That contradicts herself.  If she could deal with everything else then she wouldn't die for edward.    Spoiler ends      Aside from some character flaws,  plot flow,  and the disappointing resolution, the book continues with the same addictive storyline and interesting twists along the way.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Ok, I had been waiting to watch this movie for a long, long time. The release in my country's theaters has been delayed -again-. So, I decided to get the DVD instead...I congratulate myself, lol. This is such a sweet story, the performances are delightful and the entire atmosphere works amazingly. Ricci's Penelope is endearing -if this character had been played by any other actress it could have not worked at all- in her hands, Penelope is absolutely adorable. James Mcavoy delivers gold -again!! he seems to REALLY be able to act all genres masterly-  and the rest of the cast surely will draw a smile in your face. If you are in the mood of a well told empowering romantic tale, this is for you!
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|I love the new album.  Shinedown has become one of my favorite new bands.  I recently attended a small venue that they did. Seriously, probably less than 500 in attendance.  They are the nicest, most down to earth group of guys ever. They hung around and chated for a couple of hours after the concert. It was incredible. I know they have gone through some hard times but they are back and rockin!  Hope they are around for many years to come.      JC - Houston, TX
B00110K62U|5.0|I remember seeing this as a PBS special a few years ago, and I really enjoyed it.  Recently I saw some snippets of it on You Tube, and decided to buy a copy.  It was money well spent.  The music is fantastic, the voices send a chill through the body.  I could watch and listen to this over and over, and never tire of it.  I really enjoyed the novel that it was based on.  Pure entertainment!
B0011HF6GE|1.0|OK, who else is really bored of said artists going off on some Siddhartha like quest only to come back with a collection of \\"feel sorry for myself\\" tunes?<br />Probably no one except for me, that's why I'm writing this. How many more of these records must we endure? I'm soo sick of guys with beards and chicks with hairy armpits thinking that this type of posturing is getting them closer to some sort of dime store spiritual state. It's pathetic and transparent, \\"I just sort of went up to the woods to really be alone with my thoughts...blah blah blah.\\" Dude, the songs are boring and you sound like every other Granola eating monkey trying to emote about some broad you broke up with God knows how long ago, get over it! We all go through this buddy, you ain't special!<br /><br />On the positive side, it's nice that Bon sat up in his little cabin making cute songs with his little ol' guitar! Good on ya! I'm sure there are tons of little boys and girls out there who will gladly sing along with you and talk about how keen your lyrics are and how they can really \\"identify\\" with \\"where you're comin' from, Dude.\\" Oh yeah, and probably plenty of tunes that can be played on s*#t programs like Grey's Anatomy, The Hills, House M.D., Orange County etc.<br /><br />I guess though with musical zero's like Devendra Banhart out there, I shouldn't be too bothered by this runny nose of an album. \\"Folk\\" is the term used I believe, I think I'll stick with early Bob, Fred Neil and Karen Dalton thanks!
B0018AK9RA|4.0|I can understand why Judas Priest's Nostradamus is controversial. It's completely unlike anything they've ever done before and only occasionally sounds like Judas Priest. Nostradamus has more in common with progressive and symphonic metal than Priest's classic sound. I happen to be a huge fan of progressive/symphonic metal, so that's perfect. The music here is excellent. These songs are among the most complex and beautiful compositions that Downing, Tipton and Halford have ever attempted. There's a lot of variety, with acoustic guitars, keyboards, strings (or simulated strings anyway) giving the record a very epic, very operatic sound. I dig this, but not everyone is going to. The concept is adequate, but really I'm mostly interested in the music. I have no idea what Halford is singing about half the time, but I don't really care. I would enjoy this record no less if it were completely instrumental, though I would certainly miss Halford's vocals. The lyrics are a bit on the cheesy side. They're mostly the same heavy metal cliches that Priest has been using for 25 years. Anyone who has seen \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" will certainly find much to giggle about. Somewhere in all the cliches is supposedly the story of the life of Nostradamus, but I can't find it. The lyrics are my biggest criticism, but the great music more than makes it worthwhile.     Naturally, this is really not Judas Priest's forte. The conceptual metal thing is probably best left to groups like Dream Theater, Blind Guardian, Epica and Symphony X. However, it's certainly an interesting, ambitious change of pace for the band and I'm happy that they attempted it. If you want Judas Priest to attempt to remake Painkiller or Screaming for Vengeance with every record, you will probably not like Nostradamus. But for those who are a bit more adventurous and can appreciate a bit of variety, Nostradamus should be a very rewarding listen.

B00005JPY0|4.0|Well what do ya know...Axel Law is back with a review!  And it's been over 2 years!<br />Hold the applause, please...I'm a little rusty, so here goes.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT is the direct sequel to BATMAN BEGINS, once again directed by Christopher Nolan.  Most of the cast is back; Maggie Gyllenhall replaces Katie Holmes and we have two new additions...the villains played by Aaron Eckhart and the late Heath Ledger.<br /><br />Before we start off, those of you that know me, I tend to be a stubborn reviewer.  I've written reviews that borderline egocentric bias and am usually brutally honest.  I come from the mid-80s when Michael Keaton was the coolest Batman and my thoughts were always \\"I'll be damned if they ever find someone as good as him.\\"  I'm usually guarded and critical going into movies, especially those that pertain to my childhood.  I offer no apologies for the way that I write, but I think I do make an effort to be fair and just.<br /><br />That being said, I have to admit that I walked into BATMAN BEGINS with some skepticism and I really didn't like Christian Bale's Batman voice.  However, I feel I am content to say that THE DARK KNIGHT improves on the first movie in a lot of ways.  First off all...while I am not 100% comfortable with Christian Bale as Batman, he is starting to grow on me.  He's the first actor to start impressing me in the role since Michael Keaton, and if they make a third one he will have the role down perfectly.  Secondly, I liked Maggie Gyllenhall as a replacement over Katie Holmes.  I've never been a Katie Holmes fan (despite the fact that she's cute) and felt that her acting was flat in BATMAN BEGINS.  Maggie Gyllenhall has more depth to her, and the chemistry between she and Aaron Eckhart was convincing.<br /><br />The two standout actors that won me over in this movie were Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face and Heath Ledger as the Joker.  While the movie got a lot of hype because of Heath Ledger's untimely death, appraisal of his performance is WELL-deserved.  Eckhart brings out a really twisted Two-Face without being obvious, and his transformation into the character was smooth and well-developed.  Ledger was cynically funny as the Joker and what impressed me was they never bothered to develop the Joker's back story...something that allows me to disconnect his performance from Jack Nicholson's in the original Tim Burton BATMAN.  Ledger is a very quirky, cynical, but strangely loveable Joker, and I have to admit it's haunting knowing that Heath's career came to an abrupt end.  I especially liked his fight scenes with Batman, which was a slight reminder to Keaton and Nicholson battling it out in the original movie.<br /><br />Overall, I was genuinely surprised by the movie.

It's good to know that the next generation can have a Batman series worth enjoying, and it will not surprise me if Heath Ledger gets---at least---an Oscar nomination for his performance.ings out a really twisted Two-Face without being obvious, and his transformation into the character was smooth and well-developed.  Ledger was cynically funny as the Joker and what impressed me was they never bothered to develop the Joker's back story...something that allows me to disconnect his performance from Jack Nicholson's in the original Tim Burton BATMAN.  Ledger is a very quirky, cynical, but strangely loveable Joker, and I have to admit it's haunting knowing that Heath's career came to an abrupt end.  I especially liked his fight scenes with Batman, which was a slight reminder to Keaton and Nicholson battling it out in the original movie.    Overall, I was genuinely surprised by the movie.

0312360266|2.0|I just finished this book and I can't understand why it has so many stars.  It has way too many weird rituals going on all the time.  I caught myself skipping a lot of the wording.  It got pretty boring at times.  I kept waiting for it to pick up and almost gave up a few times.  I did finish it to see if anything would happen (I hate not finishing a book).  I'm sure I won't read the others in the series. Too much nasty sexual crap in it for me. It almost had a santanistic feel to it.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have had my swivel sweeper for about 6 months.  It has not broken, and the battery still charges.  It is indispensable for cleaning round the cats' litter box.  Cleaning carpet strains the battery, but it does pick up every grain and crumb.  In the kitchen, after clean-up from the evening meal, I just run the swivel cleaner over the tiles, and all the crumbs, and dropped food is picked up.  The four brushes and swivel head give amazing versatility, and it is easy to get into corners and narrow places.  For the kitchen and bathrooms, it beats my Roomba in noise and speed and with very little effort from me.  In fact, I plan to buy a second one, so that I have one both upstairs and downstairs.  It is a little clumsy to empty, but it works!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000UJDLM Short Circuit]]    I went with my 12 year old daughter to see the movie Wall*E, it was good but it triggered a memory rush back to an old favourite 'Short Circuit', which I enjoyed much more.  We could only find Short Circuit 2 at the store, so I ordered it from Amazon.  I enjoyed it just as much all these years later and  my daughter loved it just as much, so much so she has had her girlfriends over for a \\"Short Circuit\\" movie night which included Short Circuit 2.  They all loved it.  I guess we proved it's a timeless movie!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|This is a wonderful book, as many people have indicated in their reviews. I just felt that it lacked the depth to earn 5 stars. But it is a truly enjoyable read!
B000NJVWVO|5.0|This is a great album.  If you purchased the single disc album you might want to reconsider purchasing the double, import CD.  It contains two extra songs not included on the double, deluxe album: (\\"I Won't Let You Lie To Yourself\\" and \\"Enchantment (amp fiddler remix)\\").  The music is very soulful in an eclectic way.  It differentiates itself from being classified as \\"Rhythm and Blues\\" or \\"Pop\\".  She defines her unique style in her rendition of tunes originally recorded by Led Zeppelin (Since I've Been Loving You), Aretha Franklin (Daydreaming), and Bjork (Venus As A Boy). You will probably enjoy the entire album if you can vibe to the previously released singles, \\"Put Your Records On\\" and \\"Like a Star\\".  Her vocals are hypnotically soothing to the ear and this album will be remembered as a classic.  It will withstand the test of time because it can hold up to repeated play.  I am satisfied with this purchase and I will continue to enjoy this album in future listening.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Finally the new generation of Batman films has arrived and he is on the run. The film is long and there are many moments when no action happens, when the hero or the people are there to reflect upon events, to go down deep into themselves, to show us their feelings, their fears, their hopes. The film becomes a lot more psychological, mental even. It is talking of people, real people and how they react and live in a tense situation. The best moment of the film is when the people themselves have to decide who is going to die, them on one side or the others on the other side. They can do it on both sides and neither sides do it. They vote overwhelmingly for killing the others and yet they don't carry out their decision. Democracy is the worst imaginable regime because a majority is always found for the least ethical decisions that more or less demagogically please the masses, caress them in the right direction. And yet it remains the best because in these worst situations imaginable the people kind of react against the horror and the terror and do not follow the majority rule or reveal another layer of majority rule deeper and finer, well hidden but always ready to come out. The film shows how what is at stake is not what the masses are going to do in a crisis situation. It is what are the few individuals who have power and the means to use that power going to do, or rather become? And there the answer is super-negative. Individuals are always corrupted by the forces behind the terror that swoops down onto the masses. That's politics and that's well seen. And yet that's false when the film pretends these few corruptible people can be stopped. At least not the way the film says. They are never corrupted alone and they move into that corrupted state along with quite many people, armed forces, security forces and even more. The film is deeply reflecting on recent events but the diagnosis is wrong and the solution is wrong too. It will not be enough to get rid of the corrupted individual. It will not even be enough to get rid of him and the inner circle of his legion. You will have to explain why at a certain moment that man captured a vast majority of the people in elections or just public opinion. And you'll have to provide a way to reverse that fact and to prevent it from happening again. And then you will find you cannot prevent that because such massive support to evil when it is draped in a long shining armor of good is long lasting, very long lasting. The next solution is to turn that corrupted person into a dead hero. But then you have to turn your best friend into the fiend the masses require. Think of president Saakashvili in Georgia. He took the decision to send troops into Ossetia. That was a bad decision showing how he had been corrupted by his re-election and the anti-Russian feelings of some. You can even say he had been influenced if not directly manipulated by the Russians, or even by the West which more or less promised support, even military, another manipulation of course. His mind got corrupted and he provoked the big northern neighbor and he got what he deserved: his two military bases destroyed, the main airport destroyed, the main harbor destroyed, the basic infrastructures disrupted, the pipelines stopped. A military, economic, social and political catastrophe. Then what? Oust him and turn him into a hero? Follow the call of the hard liners among the people and start a guerrilla warfare adventure, provided the Russians decided to stay in Georgia? Send Bush to burry him deep and under a thick layer of concrete? Punish the Russians with isolation, as if they gave a damn about it because we, in the West, need their natural gas and their oil, not the reverse. This film is thus discussing this fundamental issue of what do we do with corrupted leaders who have commanded at some time in their careers vast support from the masses? The solution proposed is unrealistic. But the film is superb, especially because the Joker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown. This time he is not a clown at all. And that is true: terrorism, even criminal terrorism and not political terrorism, is not funny, is not a game, is not a show. And it has means to get under the skin of most people. And then there is no solution, except an innocent fiend who will be on the run forever, like Ben Laden? We can wonder if our enemies, fiends are not such illusive evil beings who are not that evil but are necessary for the real evil ones to be kept in place. And are there even really alive, are they really real?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesker is really vicious and dangerous, really blood curdling and sickening, whereas with Jack Nicholson he was a funny clown.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the movie Serenity before I saw the series, but I am totally hooked! The dialogue, the plot, and especially the characters all fit so well together. If I had one wish, it would be to bring the series back with all th original characters and writers. WATCH THIS SERIES!!
1892005034|5.0|Participating in a weekend workshop on Nonviolent Communication about 15 years ago, before the first book was ever published, changed my life ever since.  I was so excited when I later discovered a book had been published.  I have since given this book as a gift many times.  In almost every case (the cases in which the person actually read the book!) the person had a very similar experience to my own.  This book will help you see communication (and relationships) in a whole new way.  As a therapist I have found this book to be helpful to clients with anger management difficulties and problems with conflict in relationships.  It also promotes self-awareness and self-acceptance.  It takes practice, but once you understand and internalize the general attitude promoted in this book, it sticks.  And then it seeps into your life like a soothing balm.  That's right, like a soothing balm.  Try it; you'll see what I mean.
B000ZK4466|5.0|I don't write artistic music reviews. Let me just say that I have listened to this album almost every day since it was released, and I am still far from bored or sick of listening to it. I have not listened to much of my other music this year, Bedlam seems to have sucked the life out of it all. I hope the Volta unleashes more brutal assaults on us soon. I hear the next album will be mellow/acoustic.
0142004235|5.0|Finally!  This was quick, simple, and they sent a used book which was exactly in the perfect condition they described...... the package even had a small smiley face with a note to enjoy.  Corny? Maybe, but I felt like a real person took an interest in wrapping and mailing this spell-binding classic story of good and evil in which the characters are as alive and real today as they were in the early 1900's.  This is truly a book to keep and re-read.
B000S66XR0|5.0|Thank you this was a great present for my dad. He was so excited to listen to Boston on its original format!
031606792X|5.0|When the cover art was released showing chess pieces, I thought it might mean a stalemate finish for Edward and Bella. I loved that this book kept surprising me with twists and turns I didn't expect.  I also liked that major events started in the first chapters rather than at the finish of the book.  As a mom of a teen reader, I liked how the romance aspect was handled.  It satisfied without being explicit.  I work in a library and I have not had anyone say anything but they LOVED this book.  Kudos to Stephenie!
0385340990|4.0|I did not expect that this book would go by so quickly. It is a spellbinding epistolary novel (the narrative is told by means of letters) about England in the immediate post-WWII years, coming to terms with the past of the German occupation on the island of Guernsey, and human relationships. The female protagonist is an author in search of a subject; by means of a letter from a reader she works her way into island society and writing the story of an islander who was taken away to a concentration camp by the Germans. In the process she discovers herself and gets herself an entirely new family.<br /><br />I think the main strength of this novel is that it leaves the positive out in front but only hints at the negative. There is plenty of negative in the story (war, concentration camps, deaths, betrayal, etc.) but it is all only ever hinted at rather than being brought into the open. By means of this technique the author can deal with the processing of a sad, tragic story in an upbeat, pleasant way and make the definite \\"happy ending\\" of the novel also not seem quite so overwhelming.<br /><br />This would be a good vacation read and it is a book that you don't need to worry about giving as a gift as there is absolutely nothing objectionable about it. A very pleasant reading experience.
0385486804|4.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" is an engrossing read...it grabs and keeps your attention, traces an interesting story arc and covers a unique subject matter.  That being said, the real draw and merit of this book is the character study enmeshed in the broader story.<br /><br />Krakauer's strong storytelling skills, his subject matter expertise and his in-depth reporting on the story of Chris McCandless combine to weave an engaging...and disturbing...tale.  This tale addresses the \\"what\\" part of McCandless's journey into the wild, but it is the \\"why\\" part of the journey that really makes this book interesting.<br /><br />In addressing the question of \\"why\\"...why would McCandless do what he did...Krakauer draws on a number of other like stories to build an interesting and introspective character study.<br /><br />As with another book written by this author, [[ASIN:0385494785 Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster]], Krakauer's own persona looms large.  In the case of \\"Into the Wild,\\" I found Krakauer brought his own experiences too far into the center of the character study aspect of this book.  That being said, the author's perspective is interesting and relevant, just too front-and-center when compared to the other personalities paralleled over the course of the book.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good book and I recommend it to readers interested in a general entertaining and informative book, as well as to readers with an interest in a good character study.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|What a fantastic show!  The writing, the acting...All seems so real!  I couldn't get enough!
B000HT386M|4.0|I was expecting this film to suck.  I thought it was going to be slapstick and boobs, but it was much more.    Perhaps it's because I have young kids and a husband who is constantly looking at his blackberry, I dunno.  I really enjoyed it. I laughed, I cried, it was better than the time I went to see Cats at a really old theater in Baltimore, sat in the back so I couldn't hear anything, and was worrying about my daughter being at the babysitters for so long.    If you like Adam Sandler, I recommend it.
006112429X|5.0|I read the reviews for this book after I finished reading it. When the people say it doesn't get that interesting until after the first 50 or so pages, I completely agree. I almost put it down but I try not to give up on a book I pay more than a dollar for :P<br /><br />I'm one of those people that has a short attention span and prefers conversations between people over long descriptions of everything in a book. I was a little worried because this is one of those books where there are a lot of descriptions because they are letters written to her husband. Once I got past the first 50-75 pages, I couldn't put it down. There are plenty of great reviews written about this book that go into detail what the book is about. I just wanted to say that the end was surprisingly shocking and unpredictable (to me anyway) and after I finished the book I kind of just sat there and thought about it. Usually when I put down a book, I can easily find something else to do, or pick up another book and start a new story, but I let this one sink in. It makes you think. Personally, it shocked me.<br /><br />I do believe it is one you can reread. You will more than likely catch missed details after you've read it through. I do disagree with the people that described this book as horror or thriller. To me, it was a story about a hard life for all involved. Very interesting book. Give it a chance.
031606792X|5.0|While some people are reading a little to much into this book, and reading the book a little too much, they seem to be over thinking the plot.      I enjoyed this book as much if not more than the previous three. I am not some lovestruck teenager who just couldn't wait for a sex scene; but I am a 20-somehting married women who enjoyed the romance of first love and its consequences.      *Spoiler Alert*    Breaking Dawn had many parts that did not seem appealing at face value: a book in Jacob's perspective, the name Renesmee, Jacob imprinting Renesmee, and Bella's 180 degree character change after becoming a vampire.  But if you think about them, they were crucial to the story line.      Only Jacob could show what Bella looked like, while still actively participating in the action.  As far as Jacob inprinting his great love's child, I thought that was pretty obviously explained.  The connection between Bella and Jacob was actually a conection between Jacob and Bella's unborn child.      Bella is a child of the 21st century, and they have a tendency to make up names.  The time she was born is central to the character's contrast with the vampires from another time.  Many people were upset at Bella's transformation into a vampire, that it changed her too much, but I think the bigger transformation was becoming a mother.  That was an instinctive pull that matured her instantly.      Overall, Breaking Dawn was well written and ended even better than I could have hoped.  We can't expect Meyer to sacrifice her story so that she can put female impowerment over the characters' developement.  we don't all have the same view of a strong woman.  For some of us, protecting your family is the most important thing you can do in your life.
B00005JPY0|4.0|In this latest Batman outing, it is the brilliant acting by the late Heath Ledger as the Joker that becomes the core of the movie in probably his greatest role. He embellished the part with quirky mannerisms like poking the corner of his mouth with his tongue. His face, even with its thick make-up, expresses the deep resentment and pain within him. The funniest scene is when he's in a nurse's dress walking away from his horrific bombing of a hospital.<br />Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne does a creditable job. Christian Bale and Christian Slater: two leading actors of the day with the first name Christian, and both have run afoul of the law; no wonder people have difficulty differentiating between the various current cookie-cutter young actors.<br />Bale, when he's in the Batman costume, presents a problem. Batman is wrestling with his conscience about the lost lives he has cost, but when his voice is a deep croak and when he's encased in that ridiculous new bloated, mechanistic costume that takes away all humanity; his soul-searching becomes meaningless. If he is made to look like a machine, how does that jibe with his deep angst over his human conscience?<br />Subsidiary characters are very well-acted; Michael Caine is the butler, Morgan Freeman plays a character like the armorer Q from the James Bond flicks, Gary Oldman plays police lieutenant Gordon, and Gary Eckhart plays crime-fighting Harvey Dent. This movie has two supervillains because it also features Two-Face with his coin tosses from the comic books. The scarred half of his face features an eye like a big marble.<br />Watch for spectacular vehicular mayhem with trucks, creative camera work featuring the eerie and forbidding cityscape with a scale that dwarfs human beings. Explosions and fires, characters defying gravity by spectacular flights--this movie entices the senses, and gives us lots of WOW moments. After all the smashing of windows in this picture, why would anyone in the flick stand by big wall sized windows again?<br />But the movie is too long by about twenty minutes. It could have been tighter, less repetitive and more gripping with a faster pace. The last fourth has too much pontificating and preaching. Also at the end it steps out of chronological sequence. The movie keeps too many plot strands running.<br />I saw it on an Imax screen, but it was not in three D format necessitating glasses. This is a fine movie, but its length and repetitiveness are off-putting. Because this film has been such a blockbuster, the Batman searchlight, hailing the masked avenger, will surely be relit.gain?

0061537934|5.0|This is a perfect combination of whimsy, intelligence and creativity.  While most authors might fall into the temptation of getting carried away with the narrative gimmick employed in this novel, this author is very careful to balance the narration of the story with actually telling the story itself.  And what a story it is!  If you are looking for a truly unique reading experience this summer, start with this book.  I give it my highest recommendation.
B000EQ5SR0|5.0|If you are a Science fiction fan you'll love this movie, it kept my attention all the way through, and that is very hard to do. Any fan of the cartoon version from MTV will love the way that they brought it to the silver screen.
0800141660|4.0|This is an excellent version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", and I'll say right up front that the DVD extra of Emma Thompson's Golden Globe acceptance speech is a much watch.  It's hilarious.    Onto the movie itself.    Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson do a fantastic job of selling Elinor and Marianne.  It's a bit hard visually since Thompson looks so much older than Winslet, but they do the sisterly rather than the mother-daughter thing, so it works.  Winslet's hurt look when Willoughby won't shake her hand was the defining scene for me; with Elinor, it was the scene where she quietly drinks tea while the rest of the house is in an uproar over Willoughby's defection.    What else I liked.  Greg Wise and Alan Rickman as Willoughby and Brandon, respectively, are good as well.  Imelda Staunton as the cheery Charlotte Palmer and Hugh Laurie as her sarcastic husband are fun.  Laurie's few scenes are excellent - he comes across as sarcastic and displeased, but his genuine offer of help to Elinor when Marianne is sick is well done.  (But hey, it's Hugh Laurie.)    I liked how they use Margaret Dashwood to enhance Edward and Brandon; I enjoyed the non-Austen map scene as well as Brandon's teasing Margaret over her curious questions about the Indies.    Imogen Stubbs as Miss Lucy Steele was fantastic.  I'd seen this movie very early, before I read the book, and for awhile in the movie I couldn't figure out if she was supposed to be a good guy or a bad one.  Stubbs' sweet, earnest expression plays so well into Lucy's underhandness.    The other side characters were all right but not memorable.    What sucked: Edward Ferrars.  He didn't even show up and sent Hugh Grant in his place.  This was the worst Edward Ferrars I've ever seen; instead of Austen's Ferrars, this guy is basically a Regency version of every other character Hugh Grant's ever played.  He's kind of an inarticulate, kind of stammering, nervous, shy, bumbling but genuinely nice guy.  This is not Austen's Edward Ferrars.  I'll admit I missed it the first time I saw it - I had not yet read the novel - but upon second viewing it was pretty clear the disparity between Austen's and Thompson's versions.  It's a puzzlement as to why he's written this way; of course Thompson knows Austen better than this, and Grant has got more range than that usual bumbling thing.    A definite watch, though with a caveat emptor.
0446577391|2.0|I had read one other book in the \\"Camel Club\\" series and was disappointed.  However, after seeing all the great reviews for this book I decided to give the series another shot (plus I have just gotten a Kindle and it was cheap :-)).  Once again I was disappointed.  I would have given this 1-star, but Balducci's writing style is interesting - he moves the plot (what there is of it) along at a good pace.  However, the characters were flat/one-dimensional with no depth.  The 'bad guys' always make mistakes at just the right time and the 'good guys' are basically superheroes that always make the right move.  The plot is driven by superhuman achievements by the heroes and by ridiculous coincidences.  No more \\"Camel Club\\" books for me...
0767020308|4.0|I did watch this AFTER watching the 1996 Gwyneth Paltrow version and do prefer this one.    I'm not a Kate Beckinsale fan, she does Emma well.  She's more proper and more restrained than Paltrow.  The scene that sticks in my mind most is her face after Knightley chews her out for being mean to Miss Bates.    I definitely preferred this George Knightley.  Davies does a better job of showing Knightley as a person rather than a plot mover; it was far clearer that he was a responsible landowner, riding out to check on his workers and striking up a friendship with a tenant farmer like Robert Martin.  He also feels older than Emma in this version, as it was in the book.  Mark Strong, of course, is an excellent actor and does this character wonderfully.    One of the strengths of this version is its Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.  This Frank is good, but then it's not hard to beat the Miramax version, which had me laughing (at it).  Olivia Williams, though, was to me the memorable Jane Fairfax: quiet, put-upon, long-suffering - she captured Jane Fairfax in a nutshell.  Williams' performance drove home what every reader and viewer feels at the end: Jane deserves so much more than that jerk Churchill.  Loved it.    Lucy Robinson, fresh from being the annoying yes-woman Mrs. Hurst to Anna Chancellor's Caroline Bingley, is Mrs. Elton; Samantha Morton, Harriet Smith.  Both are good performances, and at least for me, on par with their Hollywood counterparts.  Of course, Harriet drives me nuts with her spinelessness, so I'm not a good person to judge any Harriet Smith.    A definite plus: showing Emma's nephew.  A key line running through the novel is Emma's reluctance for George Knightley to marry.  She believes she doesn't want Knightley to marry because of disinheritance; Emma's older sister is married to George's younger brother, and their son (Emma and George's nephew) Henry is George Knightley's heir.  Emma says her primary fear is that Henry will be disinherited if Knightley marries and produces a son, and that is her ostensible reason for opposing Mrs. Weston's suggestion that Knightley favors Jane Fairfax and Harriet's affection for Knightley.  It's not until later she realizes that her own feelings for Knightley are playing as large a role as Henry's disinheritance in her reluctance for him to marry.  This aspect comes out very well in this version of \\"Emma\\".    If I had to choose one (which I didn't; I have both), I'd choose this one.  It's overall a more faithful version.
0375842381|1.0|I purchased this box set after seeing the movie and out of curiousity (to see what the Christian Coalition was up in arms about). Books 1 and 2 were fine but when I got to the 3rd I could not finish it.  I am a Protestant and perhaps this will turn some folks off from reading this review - perhaps it won't for others.  Pullman is an admitted atheist and has advised he wrote these books to be an antithesis to C.S. Lewis' works - Chronicles of Narnia. Pullman has criticized Lewis' works (and everyone has a right to do so of any work, don't get me wrong).<br /><br />I was actually offended by the fact that Pullman is using children in the story to further his atheistic agenda. There is brutality against the children by the so-called church in his story, making the church out to be a bunch of crazy, evil people... These children are abused psychologically and killed by these very same people. The main character's father and mother are insane as well - not something I see as virtuous at all. Aside from that, Pullman takes the topic of God further by suggesting He is a deceitful and lying entity(I won't spoil it with a more detailed explaination for you if you so choose to read this literature).<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...] Very disappointed in this series.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" has never been a favorite with me; Catherine is too naive to suit my tastes.  Still, I wanted to see what would happen with this one, and Andrew Davies shows again why he's a master.      Catherine here is displayed in all her glory.  Her naviete is evident, but she demonstrates some very great character qualities; her eagerness to think well of people is very sweet, and her loyalty to her brother is beautiful.  Felicity Jones shows very clearly but very properly Catherine's unhappiness and suspicion (even in Catherine Morland!) of Isabella Thorpe's flirtation with Frederick Tilney.  Her sadness and regret when she discovers how easily she's been swayed by her Gothic novel reading is palpable.  The writing is fantastic and Jones carries off the character brilliantly with all the wide-eyed innocence necessary for the role.    JJ Feild's Henry Tilney is fantastic.  He's everything that he should be: smart, gentle, upright, friendly, and patient with Catherine.  Tilney's the sort of guy people would have a drink with *and* entrust their children to, and Davies and Feild capture that.  Sorry, Peter Firth, Feild's got you beat on every single count here.    I have to mention Carey Mulligan's Isabella Thorpe.  Mulligan plays all that sweet-faced innocence while being a money-grubbing jerk underneath; she's fantastic.  When she gets her comeuppance at Frederick Tilney's hands, it's hard to be sympathetic.  Still, Davies puts in that moment when Frederick Tilney outmaneuvers Isabella and she gets her comeuppance - excellent addition - and Mulligan carries it off brilliantly.  That momentary pathos Mulligan infuses into Isabella really manages to drive home Elinor's warning to Catherine that Isabella will be hurt.    Eleanor is lovely - a wonderful, female version of her brother Henry, with all the spirit and gentleness he has.  (They're my favorite brother-sister pair in all of Austen.)  Frederick Tilney is wonderfully rakish.  The Allens are very cute.There are flashes of Davies in the script.  He sort of does the over the top sometimes, and the visualizations of Catherine's Gothic imaginings fit that over-the-top bill.  Still, Davies is a master at catching Austen's humor, and the joke's on Catherine - which he manages to capture with brilliance.    Beating the 1986 Maggie Wadey-written \\"Northanger Abbey\\" isn't a huge feat (sorry, Ms. Wadey), but this version does more than that.  As of right now it's set a pretty high mark to beat.
1400063515|2.0|To me Taleb's underlying thesis is blatantly obvious. Random and chaotic events occur and greatly impact our everyday lives -- I think most of us can understand this. However by definition these events are \\"unmodelable\\". Probabilistically speaking these events are extremely unlikely yet provide huge impact upon our final outcome.   What Taleb fails to provide is a framework for dealing with these \\"Black Swan\\" events. I don't think any book can really claim to be ground breaking by simply outlining that life is random (a generally understood fact) and giving several examples.  Sure I learned about a couple of such events that have occurred in history, which is somewhat interesting but certainly not something that makes me rethink my current decision making framework. The fact is randomness exists in life. Models are our best attempt at taming this randomness. I fail to see what alternative Taleb provides - Shall we just throw out all the models simply because they are poor? Poor is still better than nothing, and everyone understands this.     For instance suppose I wish to make a decision : should I buy a cup of coffee or not?  This is a yes or no question. The naive model says evaluate the expected utility of the coffee versus the cost. Taleb would say this is a crappy model because it fails to take into account the fact that you could meet the CEO of a company in line and then hit it off and start a new venture which could change your life. You could be held up at gun point because the store is robbed and shot.    Thats all fine and dandy but when I'm making the decision there is a huge universe of such life changing outcomes all equally probable in my mind. Thus when making the decision I have to use my best facilities to evaluate returns and opportunity cost which is in the end is the simplistic model.    So in the end he fails to provide any new model for evaluating risk... It's obvious that we can't predict the future. He is correct --  markets could collapse if a nuke hit america... or some other \\"Black Swan\\" occurrence happened. But the fact is we can't really practically use any of these events to model risk because there is an infinite universe of such \\"Black Swan\\" events each with near zero probability -- thus they don't provide any information gain.    One example I found to be lacking was when he talked about the banking crisis (where South American countries all simultaneously defaulted on their loans) ... and implied that this meant that \\"bankers were not conservative\\". His basic vice is that many strategies produce very little volatility yet still contain chaotic possibility of an extremely large loss. Unfortunately he never offered a practical alternative to what conservative should be defined as.  Humans have limited tools to evaluate risk, I think everyone realizes that our models aren't perfect (yet in the book Taleb seems to think that no one  has had this insight).   This pattern occurs throughout the book -- Taleb chastising people for wrongly evaluating future occurrences without offering any practical alternative.     I would not buy this book if you are an academic -- it is good for someone looking for a casual read but doesn't provide any significant ideas on how to better evaluate risk
B000YIGNKE|3.0|I rate this higher than \\"Becoming Jane\\" (3.5) just because it's \\"Persuasion\\", and the story is just fantastic - though Austen should get credit for it.  Overall, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't fantastic.  It was a far better effort in comparison to its 1990s predecessor than the 2005 \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was to its 1990s counterpart.    Sally Hawkins didn't do horribly, and she conveys the gentleness and patience of Anne Elliot well.  When she's happy to see Wentworth, you can tell the difference between her sadder moods, but I don't remember quite feeling Anne's despondency as much.  If Amanda Root hadn't gone before her, I doubt we'd all beat up on Hawkins as badly.  It's really  not a bad performance.    So Rupert Penry-Jones is the finest looking Wentworth I've seen yet, though not the best Wentworth I've seen.  Like Hawkins, he's not bad; I loved how Penry-Jones played it when Wentworth sees Lady Russell again for the first time since she separated him and Anne.  Unfailingly polite, he does manage to convey the necessary emotions at the necessary parts.  His concern and slight panic when he discovers people expect him to offer for Louisa is well done.  Again, same problem; he was preceded by Ciaran Hinds, and it's a little bit like Macfayden attempting Darcy after Firth.    No real opinion on the script...again, liked the inclusion of the conversation where Wentworth finds out that people expect him to offer for Louisa.  I have mixed feelings about how the writer moved the Benwick-Anne conversation about how men and women love: it fits where it is in the movie, but in the book it's a key factor in Wentworth's offering again for Anne at the end.  Anne running the \\"streets of Bath\\" marathon - CHEESY AND DUMB.    Really liked Finlay Robertson's Benwick; I found him more memorable than Richard McCable's 1995 version.  This Benwick looked truly lovesick at the loss of his fiancee.  Alice Krige's Lady Russell was well done as well.  How she did the conversationwhere Lady Russell and Anne discuss Wentworth at the start of the movie was very good.  It's easy to believe that Lady Russell is really just looking out for Anne; Krige delivers all the maternal warmth while maintaining a regal bearing.  Hard to go wrong with Anthony Head as Sir Walter Elliot.    Go with the 1995 if you only want to watch one, but this is worth watching.
B001D7TW8U|5.0|I guess because I did not read the book first, I loved this movie.    I can see that many people rated their dissappointment based on reading the novel and comparing the movie.  I find that unfair.      Although I know how they feel.  It's impossible to reduce the breadth of a novel within the time restrictions of a feature film.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I have a preference for comedy and humor and wit (why I prefer Austen to the Brontes), and I'll admit that that's why I'm giving this version four stars rather than three.  I'm easy to sucker - if it's fun funny, it already has me hooked.    This was a very funny \\"Emma\\".  Emma can't be done in a somber, serious way - Emma is just not that sort.  The movie captures Emma in both her earnestness as well as her matchmaking silliness.  Paltrow is a lot of fun to watch, and how she fancies herself in love with Churchill is amusing to watch.    I'll also admit a weakness for actors Greta Sacchi, Alan Cumming, and Jeremy Northam.  They're just a joy to watch.    Weaknesses: lack of Austen.  It's a looser adaptation, and it misses characterization as it adds other scenes.  Davies' version does a better job, packing its shorter version with more character development (e.g. for Knightley).  I also found Olivia Williams' Jane Fairfax more memorable than Polly Walker's, although Walker's wasn't bad.    Super stink: Frank Churchill.  What the heck?  Since when was Frank Churchill a floofy-haired froufrou?  Moreover, while I can usually disassociate actors from their previous roles, I kept waiting for Churchill to pull out his light saber and cut Emma out of the big puddle.  This was a full laugh-out-loud and not in a good way.    Cute and fun, but if it's for a visual version of Austen, go with the BBC/A&E version.
B000059PQQ|3.0|The title character of this wacky, uneven comedy, Candy Christian, has a beguiling innocence and nubile figure that entices every man she meets. Her manner with them is inquisitive and soft.  The men are prominent and include Doctor Krankheit, a famous neuro-surgeon (James Coburn) and the Indian guru Grindle (Marlon Brando). They urgently want a piece of Candy, but their feelings for her are ambivalent because their desire is confounded by their professional etiquette or dignity, like a skin they wear as a matter of career survival, but which is incongruent with making love to such a free spirit. As a result, they are strict and controlling, as if to banish doubt. Coburn is good; Brando is a far cry from his Terry Malloy and Stanley Kowalski roles and is the funniest person in the movie.  Film critics generally derided the movie when it appeared in 1968. Some of their criticisms were correct; instances of sloppy casting and mediocre acting; but the critics may also dislike movies that satirize middle-aged professionals confronted with something risque. Truffaut's \\"The Soft Skin\\" and Rohmer's \\"La Collectioneuse\\" deal with similar predicaments, albeit not as flamboyantly or unevenly.  Recreational drug use may have contributed to \\"Candy's\\" uneveness, but the soundtrack by Dave Grusin and the Byrds is memorable, as is the countercultural, psychedelic aura of this cult classic.  Check it out but don't tell the wife!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|See this one; this Wentworth-Anne match is the best.    My favorite is Amanda Root; she's brilliant here.  She captures Anne's patience and gentle forbearance, but what I love most is how her eyes shine when she's happy.  It's in keeping with Anne - quiet, demure - but it shows Anne's own strength.  Even movie stills manage to capture that light in her eyes - I don't know how Root did it, but it was fantastic.  Root's performance matches the ever-excellent Ciaran Hinds, and that's not an easy task; I had a hard time watching Hinds' \\"Jane Eyre\\" (opposite Samantha Morton's Jane) because they didn't seem well matched to me.      Those two alone make this Persuasion the one to see.    I don't consider it perfect: I preferred the 2007's Benwick and Lady Russell and the 1971 miniseries' length (the 1971 isn't bad at all).  Minor, though.
0812580346|5.0|Robert Sawyer's books to me are perfect science fiction. He takes a simple premise, peoples it with wonderfully human characters, gets you emotionally involved with them, and then takes you on a wonderful adventure that challenges your beliefs and expands your mind. Again, I must repeat, I think his books are perfect, all of them, and this one, \\"Flash Forward,\\" is my absolute favorite. Thank you Robert Sawyer for being such a brilliant author.

031606792X|5.0|Everyone needs to settle down about their dislikes and dissapointments for this final book in the Twilight series. Stephenie Meyer has created a book that her readers were sub-consiously searching for. A decisive, happy ending for Edward and Bella. Had the novel ended any other way (perhaps with Bella realizing she wanted to stay human and be with Jacob), the love story between Bella and Edward as well as the connection and fascination the readers feel towards the two characters would have been seriously compromised and under-played. This was the most practical and logical ending that we all needed to gain the closure from this series. I think S.M may have never ended her series had she not concluded the story this way. I think the \\"happy\\"and \\"perfect\\" ending for every character involved is very suitable and fits along the style and genre of this entire series.... a magical story about a timeless, impossible love. Would you all have been more content with an ending coinciding with Romeo and Juliet? STOP COMPLAINING!!!!!
B000I2J6K0|4.0|This is a workout for folks who have been exercising all along and are looking for a prenatal workout that isn't too slow or easy. If you are out of shape or new to exercise try something like Crunch Yoga Mama or walk. This workout makes me feel really good when I'm done.  To be honest, I don't really enjoy this workout; I don't get lost in the exercises like I do with other workouts. I really like Kyra Landgolf's Total Body Tone.  There's a 7 mo pregnant exerciser in the video who modifies the workout for pregnancy.  This is the workout I'd recommend if you were an exerciser before and want to continue. But, back to this workout.  Expect lots of squats, some upper body work through modified pushups, some tricep dips, a few ballet moves, pilates floorwork and stretches.  Your heartrate will go up, you will sweat and you will feel really good when you are done. I haven't had the same aches and pains that I had with my first pregnancy.  I think the video is worth a try, maybe you'll connect with it more than I have.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Sometimes we learn to repair ourselves.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes external forces to repair us.<br /><br />I didn't expect to cry while watching Pixar's new film \\"WALL-E\\" today, but I did a couple times.  Pixar continues to keep making great films.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Here are some of the ideas I implied from watching it:<br /><br />We're defined by the memories we keep and the memories we share with others.<br /><br />Some of our greatest assets are the memories we save and share.<br /><br />Some of the best parts of us are things we have not created by ourselves.<br /><br />Some of the best parts of us are the quality recycled parts of others that we've gathered along the way and incorporated into ourselves.<br /><br />You could live in the best place in the universe, but if you are alone, you are alone.<br /><br />You could live in the worst place in the universe, but if you are with others working with you, you can create the best of worlds.<br /><br />We are defined by who we've allowed to hold our hand.<br /><br />We are defined by those who have chosen to stay beside us during difficult times.<br /><br />For many of us, our primary directive is not simply to pursue promoting a purpose or a place, but also to promote the pleasures of people close to us and in our community.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Stepping back and looking at the broader metaphors and themes of the primary characters in this story:<br /><br />Wall-E was a robot programmed and built to gather everyone else's garbage by consuming it, taking it inside himself, then compacting it into a smaller box.  With such a narrow build design and purpose, most, if not all of the other Wall-E robots fell apart and ceased to exist.  Seeing the arc of their existence as simple garbage collectors who then shaped their refuse blocks in to orderly piles and walls (hence the name \\"Wall-E\\"), the Wall-E droids eventually died off as they stayed within their initially programmed purpose and did not learn to adapt and repair themselves.<br /><br />Wall-E, at some point in his existence, took on broader purposes and followed his curiosities, becoming a collector of the best parts of whatever he admired in what others had thrown away or left behind.  He found value in what others considered worthless and disposable.  And instead of following his programmed directives and crushing everything he encountered into smaller boxes for disposal, he decided to separate out and save any items he encountered that showed signs of caring and ingenuity.<br /><br />Instead of simply gathering and breaking things down into smaller and uniform boxes to fashion larger groups of boxes and boundaries, the cognitive breakthrough Wall-E discovered was this:  He could do more than simply box and compartmentalize.  Instead of simply following his basic programming, he instead taught himself how to filter and preserve.  He taught himself how to create new and functional items from what others considered to be old and disposable.<br /><br />In a world of loneliness, he became a preserver of the best qualities of cleverness, engineering, resilience, and love.  He collected fire, color, song, self-growing plants, indominable bugs, costumes, shiny objects, puzzles, dance, imagery, and everything else that might someday help others to recreate a new and beautiful world out of the world he knew was dying around him . . .<br /><br />. . .a world he knew he could not rebuild better alone and on his own.<br /><br />Wall-E realized he too would crumble and become disposed if he did not regularly re-create parts of himself, protect himself, and protect the best parts of others he discovered along the way.<br /><br />Eve, a representation of feminine intelligence, power, determination, investigativeness, nurturing, and creation, comes along looking for signs of healthy and natural life.  When she finds it, she takes it inside herself, protects it inside of her with a hardened and narrow resolve, like an egg shell around a growing embryo.<br /><br />The intelligence of both characters is revealed as they adapt to the needs of everyone around them and take on more and broader purposes than the simpler and basic purposes for which they were originally programmed and designed.broader purposes than the simpler and basic purposes for which they were originally programmed and designed.
B00024I2Z4|1.0|I recently ordered Mulan 2-disc Special Edition from Amazon. I was thoroughly disappointed because there were no discs inside the case! I had to return it and because I no longer trust Amazon, I went to Borders and bought the dvd. It's a great movie, too bad Amazon failed!
B001AJVR5M|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! I think that these guys are going to bring back Boygroups and that in a way that it's not too cheezy... The song named after the album title \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" is really good and especially knowing the story of Nick's diabetes, it makes it an even better song. I recently found an AMAZING ACOUSTIC VERSION of this song on YouTube called RAW SESSION. Check it out and buy the album.
031606792X|5.0|I read all of the other books very quickly, and this one was no exception. I thought this book wrapped up the series very nicely. I liked that I understood how all of the characters ended up, and appreciated that there was no twists. It was a very satisfying way to end an epic love story!    I've read the other reviews that point to Bella's pregnancy as weird, and Jacob's imprinting as creepy. In one sense, yes, but the Twilight world, in my mind, is based on the love story between Bella and Edward, and I thought this pulled all of the characters and their stories into that.

006135323X|4.0|I found this to be a pleasant and thought-provoking book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the fundamental underpinnings of human behavior. All of Ariely's observations are research-based and are presented in an extremly accessible manner.    One chapter of the book struck me as particularly important for communicators. \\"The Cost of Social Norms\\" explores the benefits and the risks of creating a social versus a purely business relationship with customers.    Done well, the social approach develops longer-term deeper relationships between the customer and the business. The customer acts on a sense of connectedness in the business and sustains the relationship through continued interactions and transactions.    Done poorly, the social approach can create a break-up with all the animosity of a nasty divorce.    This one is staying on my bookshelf.
B001EDMIXO|2.0|I liked the plot.  The entity being Dr. Weir was unexpected, but from knowing her character too many things that she did were very uncharacteristic of her.  She put Atlantis and her people in danger several times, lied about the others knowing that she was going to Atlantis, and never lie to people, replicators or not and essentially commit genocide.  I really disliked the ending.  Both Dr. Weir and the members of the Atlantis crew would not feel comfortable killing a small group of replicators that were being peaceful, just because one went rogue and tried to escape.  I call that genocide.  Especially tricking them into walking through the stargate to their deaths while they think they are getting a chance to continue their research.  I think the writer seriously should have realized that it was out of character and in bad taste.
B00005JPNY|2.0|This movie (and I assume the book) started out with what could have been a great premise. People in a parallel universe live with their souls outside their bodies.         The special effects in the movie made the scenes wonderful to watch. However, I didn't go to the theater in order to go to a kind of moving picture art museum; I went to see a movie. And a movie requires enough character development for me to care whether or not the heroine lives or dies or the person she's trying to save lives or dies. Consequently, there's no comparison between this and Lord of the Rings. None at all.       People who read the book already might have had the character development in their heads. And if so, maybe that's how someone could give this thing three stars.        So what's even worse than the lack of character development (and therefore lack of a story worth caring about) is that the movie didn't even get close to resolving like Lord of the Rings did at the end each segment. And you can't call the end of the movie a cliff hanger because....you don't care what happens to the characters next.       But the thing that was most alarming about this film was how directly the author of the book (or the film makters)attack the Catholic Church, if not people of faith in general. I had heard some of the religious hoopla about the film before I went to see it, but there's been religious hoopla about movies before that didn't amount to very much(Example: The Last Temptation of Christ) That is NOT the case here.     Even though I'm not Catholic and am very aware of the Catholic Church's troubled history and some of its abuses, I could see that this movie was not a representation of a difference of opinion OR simply lopsided in its representation of organized religion. It was a hate-fest. I suppose this should have been clear from the beginning of the movie--before I saw how the Catholic imagery was handled--but I was trying to give the movie the benefit of the doubt. However, I doubt there's another reason to name the souls outside the body \\"demons,\\" no matter how you spell it, other than to put Catholics and people who believe in God down. (Except for creating enough religious hoopla and controversy that people go to see the movie)       Then again, it also seems like the author must have been hurt very deeply at some point by someone who CLAIMED to be a person of faith which is a very sad thing. And I'm sorry for him or her.        But back to the movie--I almost hope someone redoes the movie (and the book it's based on) and does the story again without the anti-religious messages. I know there's a good story to be built around humans having their souls outside the body. I just know it.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Whoa. I work in health care and I am very aware of some of the screwed-up issues out there. I see physicians' hands tied by insurance companies, I see physicians' costs for liability insurance climbing and payment for health care declining. Even with that insider knowledge, Sicko curled my toes. I'm sure there are two sides of the story. But I don't see the other side in my day job and Sicko opens the flood gates on horror stories. I cried and I grew enraged at the stories that were shared in this documentary. I do not agree with the cover endorsement that mentions laughter, don't think this is rollicking comedy. Sure, there is a hint of humor, but the situations shared are tragedies.<br /><br />Methodically Moore reveals the process of health insurance from application to final payment or non-payment of claims. If you hate the big business mind set and profit hunger of insurance companies and are currently insured in case you have an increase in blood pressure, you'll want to watch this film. He then investigates why we are in the situation we are, and how other countries handle health care. If you are a documentary fan, this is quite a film.<br /><br />Moore has strong opinions. I've only seen Bowling for Columbine and Sicko but in Moore's world Canada seems to hold the answers to America's problems. The American political system/government is painted as corrupt, even a segment on Hilary Clinton that begins with her as the misunderstood warrior for health care reform ends with her political campaign being financed in part by health care dollars. Moore travels the world and digs deep into the issues that are part of the problem.<br /><br />Sicko tells a horrific story. But it's a story that is one that needs to be looked into and not ignored.
B00004HYLF|5.0|Honestly, there are so many well-written and informative reviews already written here, there is little that I can add. But one of the many outstanding things about Romantic Warrior is how 'not dated' the music sounds...especially when you consider that this is jazz fusion from 1976. But in reality, this is much closer to prog-rock rather than jazz. If you are a fan of progressive rock or jam bands, than by all means, pick this up. The virtuosity of this all-star quartet is absolutely stunning. The song structures are challenging and imaginative. Bottom line...this is cerebral music that rocks!
B00080Z53O|5.0|This true story is retold on the screen with unflinching honesty, without being pat or glib, and is also touching in its depiction of a quadriplegic man and his extended family.  No wonder Javier Bardem is one of the hottest actors around now; this and his other recent films show his remarkable range. The other cast members are just as strong, showing different reactions to his wish to die with dignity and the ensuing legal battle.  He finds his own solution in the end and leaves the viewers with many issues to ponder in regard to euthanasia.

B00000I41J|5.0|Conventional wisdom holds that this is a Miles Davis album, and that is pretty much right - it's an album led by Miles Davis, under Cannonball Adderley's name, set up to showcase the altoist who had just joined Davis's band.  You can hear plenty of fine playing by Cannonball, but it's in Davis's world - the earthiness of many later Cannonball recordings isn't present.    The similarities are particularly obvious on the classic interpretation of \\"Autumn Leaves\\" and the Davis original \\"Somethin' Else\\".  \\"Love for Sale\\" was recorded under Davis's leadership 3 months later, with Cannonball present, and it's interesting to compare the two approaches.  (I prefer the Davis version, but they are both superb.)    Some people go further and compare this album to Kind of Blue.  Yes, there are some similarities, particularly in the mood, but the \\"cerebralness\\" of the later album is largely absent on Somethin' Else.  Hank Jones and Art Blakey have a very different, more conservative feel than Bill Evans and Jimmy Cobb.  And the funky \\"One for Daddy-O\\", a Nat original and the one tune that really screams \\"Cannonball Adderley album!\\", wouldn't really fit in on a Davis album, much less Kind of Blue.    Overall a great album, and essential for most jazz fans.
031606792X|5.0|It's difficult for any author to satisfy such passionate fans as the Twilight series has, but I thought this book tied up all the loose ends as much as possible.  After all, don't they deserve a happy ending?  It's easier to accept that this is the final book in the series with such a solid last book.

B000TJ6BB4|4.0|Bangles compilations are now a dime a dozen (AMG lists nearly 30!). This one caught my eye, however, being a 2CD set.<br /><br />From an audio standpoint, the mastering on this set is excellent.  Several compilations (\\"Essential\\", \\"We Are The 80's\\" and \\"Glitter Years\\") released by Columbia/Legacy in recent years have been annoyingly \\"loudened\\", but this set has the correct dynamic range of the original releases.  The audio presented here is definitely better than the original CD albums and slightly superior to the 1990 \\"Greatest Hits\\" disc.<br /><br />However, some curious and even frustrating aspects of this set are the track sequencing, the booklet and some unnecessary omissions.<br /><br />There was plenty of room to include all three of The Bangles albums in their entirety, plus the three non-album tracks (\\"Where Were You When I Needed You\\", \\"Hazy Shade Of Winter\\" and \\"Everything I Wanted\\") which all appeared on \\"Greatest Hits\\".<br /><br />Those three made it into this set, but \\"Glitter Years\\", \\"Make a Play for Her Now\\" and \\"Waiting For You\\", off their third studio album \\"Everything\\", did not.<br /><br />Disc 1 clocks in at 54:22, the second at 62:45.  So, there was available space for the inclusion of those tracks.  Heck, there was even room for \\"I Got Nothing\\" off the OOP \\"Goonies\\" soundtrack, which would have made this a complete Bangles pre-reunion studio compilation.  Frustrating.<br /><br />Then, there's the sequencing: Disc 1 has 18 tracks (the Amazon tracklist above omits #18 \\"Standing In The Hallway\\"), which curiously commences with only 4 of the 8 charted singles, then proceeds to the remainder of the first album in its entirety, correctly sequenced.  The last four tracks are from the second album, \\"Different Light\\", but out of original running order.  All not a big deal, but strange nonetheless.<br /><br />Things get much wackier on Disc 2.

B001ADHCV6|5.0|Wow.  My wife and I went to an Eagles concert recently, with 15,000 other boomers, happily expecting to hear their greatest hits from the 70's.  Imagine my surprise when the songs we were humming afer a truly excellent, smoking concert (Joe Walsh was en fuego!)were the ones from this new album.  We downloaded it as soon as we got home and it is in our Fave Five ALL the time. Nothing karaoke-esque about this double cd....the Eagles continue to sell but never sell out. Their new stuff keeps us all grounded politically (the title song should be played for both political conventions this summer)and pushing us lyrically. You'll be drumming on the steering wheel saying \\"Yes, Don, you are still the man,\\" and in awe of the way the songs are true to the Eagles sound but not lazy retreads. A revelation in every way, The Long Road is the road that should be taken and savored.
B0009OAUIO|5.0|Hunky Dory was Bowie's last album as an aspirant, just before he found fame with Ziggy Stardust. It's a fascinating work on many levels that display lyrical depth, vivid imagery, wit and great musical variety, from the music hall pop of Changes through the sixties pop of Oh You Pretty Things to the cinematic lyricism of Life On Mars, a soaring masterpiece. Another of my favorites is Fill Your Heart, a quirky number with his somersaulting voice over lively piano and cheeky sax. Elements of the folkie singer/songwriter are evident on numbers like Song For Bob Dylan while The Supermen reminds me of his later science fiction work like [[ASIN:B0001RVUW4 Diamond Dogs]]. Bowie also salutes [[ASIN:B000026A1H Lou Reed]] and Andy Warhol here, in fact the whole album makes references to his musical influences. Hunky Dory is a bridge between his earlier music hall style and the glamrock that was to follow, and this was just the right mixture of catchy tunes & brilliant lyrics to ensure a timeless classic.
031606792X|1.0|Meyer not only created a world that her characters live in but apparently, has created a world in which she, herself, resides in--a world where logic is suspended in time and is visciously murdered by her own hands; a world that is equivelant to Disney's intoxicating sense of happiness.    How else can anyone explain the horrid and asinine crap that spews forth from her book? Logically, nothing makes sense! Why would Bella dream about a baby boy but gives birth to a girl? Why would Jacob imprint on \\"Nessie\\"? Why would Bella, the protagonist, whine until she is blue in the face about marrying the guy she loves more than anything? Also, seriously? Why would Edward suggest Jacob knocking Bella up?     Disney should hire Meyer to write their happy endings for their movies. This book is over-the-top-only-in-a-disney-cartoon-happy. Isn't the whole point of the second and third book to demonstrate Bella's sacrifice as a human is she were to become a vampire? Why, then, all of a sudden would Meyer not allow Bella to sacrifice a thing? She gets her best friend Jacob--convientently her son in law *gags*--, her father, her baby and her new Cullen family. What exactly did she \\"sacrifice\\"?    Beauty and the Beasts's battle scene at the end puts to shame Breaking Dawn's battle scene. At least the house hold objects FOUGHT with the villagers. How ridiculous is it that all Bella does is throw up a shield and all of a sudden the Voltori--the supposedly most powerful and feared coven in the world--not only runs away, but apologizes?!    There is at least two dozen other issues with this book but I'll leave it at this. Re-thinking about them is painful. I need to go build my own little world to live in to block out noxious of this book. Meyer, you are not invited.

So is this Scout (or Jean Louise Finch) as an adult?

031606792X|5.0|It was a relief to see that true love wins and people can be happy in the face of adversity.  I think Meyer has done a great job giving answers to the main questions to Bella and Edward and left them in a place that is acceptable to her fans while still leaving other characters in a place where we are eager to find the rest of the story.   She has said this is the end of the story thorough Bella's eyes, and I think we have a lot to look forward from the other characters in this fantastic world that Meyer has created for us.  I can't wait.  Stephenie, bring it on!

B0017XCDN6|3.0|This is a terrific product, IF you speak Japanese or have the ability  to speed read. I purchased this item because the advertised spoken language was English or Japanese. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The spoken language is Japanese with English subtitles.

0553573411|5.0|This entire series from Assassins Apprentice all the way through the Fool books has been incredibly good. Once I start them, I can't put them down. I suggested this book to my brother & several friends & they all became addicted to the series too. The characters are intense, the plot is fascinating & I've even reread them several times which I NEVER do. Can't recommend Robin Hobb enough.

The video quality is below average and the audio quality leaves much to be desired (including hearing it as the volume fluctuates all over the decible scale). Not on my must buy list!

And Pedro, too, to a lesser extent.<br /><br />Oh, there's an ending after the credits, so check it out. It's well worth it.<br /><br />This movie is adorable, in an age of, shall I say, un-adorable, violent, shock value movies. See it, at least twice.Trust me.
B000003TA4|4.0|while much can be said about the decline in the music industry this album represents the death of rock music in the ninties.

0393061310|1.0|Without a doubt, this has got to be the worst book I have read in a long time.  What would have been an interesting blurb in the sociology section of 'Time' magazine, becomes hundreds of pages of pure mindless dreck in the hands of Jared Diamond.  Let me save you a few days of your life by summing up the book:  The reason why white, western / European societies flourished and the rest of the of the non-white, non-western world did not  was because the European climate and terrain favored domestication of plants and animals while the rest of the world's terrain and climate did not.  Therefore, western man had more free time on his hands to invent stuff and put a man on the moon, while the rest of the world, to this day, is still screwed up.  Wow.  I am so annoyed I read this book and wasted so much time doing so.

B0013K6WLM|5.0|The earlier works of the Black Keys were fantastic. I really didn't know what to expect when I was picking up Attack & Release. After hearing that the Black Keys would be working with Danger Mouse, I was a little worried.  Was the Black Keys raw style of blues rock coming to an end?    After listening to this album multiple times I grew to appreciate the new direction the Black Keys were going.  In my opinion this album is near flawless.  While Danger Mouse's touch is noticed, it is not overbearing. Attack & Release not only surpassed my expectation but now I am excited to hear their next release.  The Black Keys followed a artistic progression and nailed it.    One of my favorite albums this year.  Attack & Release gets extremely high play in my mp3 player.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|There's only one good song Coldplay has ever done and that is Clocks. Every other song has been garbage. I finally figured out why I can't stand Chris Martin. He's a wannabe of Dave Matthews. The only problem is that Dave Matthews has talent and Chris Martin has none. What boggles the mind even more is the fact that Viva La is the number one selling CD for the past few months when there are a lot better bands that have come out with cds for example, Shinedown. I've heard the first two songs from the CD and there's nothing that differentiates their sound from their first two albums.
0099494094|4.0|Some authors hold unique values which caress readers, even if the magic is a refrain from previous novels. Murakami, like Rowling or Tolkien or King, delivers us to worlds derived from his highly imaginative mind's depths - a journey which we gladly seek to follow.<br /><br />One recurring theme we see is the even versus odd chapter braiding. As the pages and plot progress, the seemingly unrelated tales enclose and eventually converge.  There was a reason for the even chapters tales of Nakata to be related to the odd chapters of Kafka - in fact the relation is deeply rooted.  Fatalistically or otherwise, the seemingly small world overlaps in boundless ways. The back and forth of stories remind us of \\"[[ASIN:0679743464 Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World]].\\"<br /><br />The even chapters are about Nakata - a boy traumatized during WW II who in today's world converses with cats, creates rains of leeches and fish, and has mystical powers with a stone.  His cat work reminds us \\"[[ASIN:0679775439 The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]].\\"<br /><br />Nakata's sleep marathons remind us of the almost comatose Eri of \\"[[ASIN:9871544057 AFTER DARK]].\\"  These sleeps make me wonder if Murakami personally has encountered deep depression wherein your body lies dormant or victim to the illness's demands.<br /><br />Ultimately, opposites attract - Nakata and a truck driver become best of friends. In \\"[[ASIN:9871544057 AFTER DARK]],\\" pimps befriend a suburban teenager staying out after her parents' proclaimed curfew.  Perhaps the strangest couple are in the odd chapters.  The odd-chapter narrator - 15-year old runaway Kafka Tamura - befriends the young and socially unaccepted Oshima: a transvestite or transgendered hemophiliac androgynous  woman who appears as a man and sexually lives a homosexual man's life. Sexual deviance is something also addressed in \\"[[ASIN:9871544057 AFTER DARK]].\\"<br /><br />Book worms Kafka and Oshima have great readers-digest talks wherein Oshima's boiled down versions of Greek tragedy depict or symbolize Kafka's issues: most importantly his Oedipal doom pronounced icily by Kafka's father to the young man when he was of elementary school age.  To avoid that prophecy, he runs. But, is it the running away that ignites the prophecy's fate?<br /><br />In the end, Kafka's life  inevitably  collides with Nakata for what appears to be a cleansing.  Getting there may have been prolonged, and the inevitability of this collision may have been too many pages known - and such truncated detail of their convergence may be what lowers this review from 5 stars to 4.

031606792X|5.0|I think Breaking Dawn was a fabulous ending for the Twilight series. Was it the ending I expected? No. Was it what most of Meyer's fanbase expected? No. However, this story was suspenseful, funny, romantic, and had tons of surprises! Some say that Meyer pushes her own morality agenda, but guess what folks--- she is the author! If she has an agenda to push, so be it. Take it or leave it. Frankly, if she is pushing an agenda, I feel like it has been a positive one for today's teens. My advice- read the book for yourself and make your own conclusions. I really enjoyed BD, the Twilight series, and the journey Bella has taken me on!
141694740X|5.0|This is literally my favorite book now. It was helpful to have a \\"professional\\" (sort of) tell me that if he's not calling, etc., he's just not that into me, and why would I want to wait around with him, when there's someone better out there who WILL BE \\"into me\\" enough to call (or whatever). The point is, why waste your time with someone who's not into you--potentially preventing you from meeting that someone who is? It goes through all the ways that he might not be \\"that into you\\" and why and how you should move on. Every woman should read this book, and I mean that.
B000FJA1BO|5.0|When I skimmed over my summer reading list for school this year, I sighed. All of the titles seemed so boring, but I knew that just with covers, one shouldn't judge a book by it's name. So I highlighted a few random novels on the list and searched them up on Google, and what the summary I found for \\"Into the Wild\\" was less than thrilling. However, I gave it a shot. It seemed different from the other books, and it didn't sound like the typical monotony that non-fiction books provide me. (Only my opinion... lol, I usually quite selective with my reading-- I know what this mind of mine enjoys and what it doesn't.)  I also found out that there was a movie, which happens to be strikingly true to the book AND  to \\"what really happened.\\" The story of Chris, or, as he later titles himself, Alex Supertramp, knocked me dead off my feet and swept me off to a place in my soul I had never thought existed! It was so utterly touching and striking and HUMAN--  Chris is a very well-off man who, after graduating college-- and having a pretty good prospect of a future going for him-- leaves society and heads to the Alaskan bush, where one can be free and uninhibited. He burns all of his money and sells all of his possessions, his backpack his only companion.  Jon Krakauer, the skilled journalist who wrote this novel, examines so meticulously the possible incentives that a single human being might have to do such a crazy thing that he touches all of the recesses of the human spirit, the human heart, and the human mind. Although this work is posthumous--for Krakauer was assigned to report the incident of Chris's death in the first place-- it would seem that Krakauer had known the adventurer personally and for a rather long time-- you see, the author did EXTENSIVE research. The readers get a clear look at Chris's past, his relationship with his father that was a big part responsible for his venturing out into the wild, and how, in fact, he was not crazy in doing what he did.   Krakauer sounds strangely fond of Chris in his writing, and one cannot blame him. Although people may deem Chris as a \\"kook\\" and \\"mentally insane\\" (which they did when the story went out in the press ten years ago), it just goes to prove that they didn't truly understand him.   Chris had a lot of reasons-- and pretty good ones, too-- to leave society. Though he took it to a level I'd hesitate to reach, he was a smart, admirable, and not to mention INTREPID for doing what he did. He died doing it, but, as reported ten years ago, when a group of moose hunters found him deceased in an abandoned bus, he had been smiling as his soul left his body.  Jon Krakauer tells a worthwhile story of young Chris's journey--from his childhood to his early death--, of ambition and dreams, and of everything that is human. It shouldn't be missed, and if anyone after having read \\"Into the Wild\\" castigates it in any aspect, I'd call THEM a \\"kook.\\" ;)
031606792X|5.0|An amazing wrap up to the \\"Twilight\\" series.  It made me laugh, cry, and, of course, get angry.  All in all...it was an amazing fantasy adventure and I'm sad to say that this is the last \\"Twilight\\" book that will be released until \\"Midnight Sun\\"...which is in Edward's perspective.  Stephenie has already said that she probably won't release a sequel to \\"Midnight Sun\\" for \\"New Moon\\" because Edward isn't a key player in that book.  Seems the series is going to end sooner rather than later.
031606792X|2.0|I have always loved the series, believe me. But this last book was completely out of sync with the previous three. At first, I thought this saga was splendid, as it explored questions like fate and destiny and true love and the sacrifices you have to make in a relationship. Or a relationship that went so deep even when you couldn't touch the other person. A relationship that was solely about the mind and about the soul and about ACCEPTANCE.  These messages haven't been destroyed by Breaking Dawn-- no, it's pretty obvious that Bella and Edward love each other, yadda yadda. That fact had been established long ago.  The things that really disappointed me were that: usually YA books can be appropriate for twelve-year-olds, but the content and suggestive material in it should really make this book an Adult fiction novel (I'm 14 and am ok with the content, but there are a LOT of eight year olds reading this stuff and that's just not right); secondly, Edward tends to push toward the \\"flat\\" side of the character spectrum, as he's pretty predictable and either black and white; thirdly, the \\"happily ever after\\" seemed so FORCED.    Explanations:  (There may be spoilers!!!)    Okay, my first point just goes without having to explain. I'm fine with suggestive material and the physical relationship bit-- hey, that's how humans, such as Bella, and the human inside Edward, show their love. But it was way. too. much.   Twilight is a a hugely popular series, and I hear little innocent girls talking about it and raving about it all the time. It's just that if I were a mother, I wouldn't want my eight-year-old reading something with such salient sexual content, you know? And plus, though Bella IS mature for her age, she is being so reckless with her life. Sure, she's in love, but is that enough reason to go running around, oblivious of the things going on around her? Like her family-- she thought about ELOPING at one point. And her friends. And to be married so young and throw her life away-- she had a choice. Edward even asked her to spend a few years in college before becoming a vampire! Anyways, next point.    Okay. Edward. I have been INFATUATED with him for the past two years, but now, he just bores me sometimes. The stuff he says is sweet, but even for me, the avid romantic, it just becomes so prosaic and predictable. In Breaking Dawn, every time Bella asks him, \\"How do I look?\\" or any variant of that, he says, \\"Gorgeous. Of course, you've always been.\\" Awwww, cute. But after at least ten times, it gets annoying.   This is just a little point though.    And now, the ending. It was to be expected. It felt so forced and unnatural, the way things played out-- Bella went to Rose for advice, Jacob fell in love with Bella's DAUGHTER, the fact that somehow a vampire and a human were able to produce a baby, and the fact that Bella had such an easy time as a young vampire. Hasn't that been the main point though? That young vampires-- and vampires in general-- didn't have much self-control? But somehow, miraculously, she had it.     It's cool that destiny was on her side and she was \\"born to be a vampire\\", but seriously, It's pushing believability  here. I know that's weird to say about a fantasy novel, chock full of vamps and wolves, but it's true. There's a boiling point. There's a boundary between imagination and far-fetched stuff evoked out of thin air in order to move the plot along.    Oh. And another thing that annoyed me.   Jacob only loved Bella-- in the romantic way-- because she was destined to have Renesmee. That's just WEIRD. It's an original idea, sure, but presented in the most odd and slightly distasteful manner possible. What, so if Bella wasn't going to have the baby at all, he wouldn't love her?   There were so many other ways Stephenie could've done this! And yet, she chose this forced ending. She made new things up in order to drag the plot along, hoping that somehow it'd get her to the ending she vowed she'd write. I can't readher mind, but that is the way it seems.   Anyone could've predicted the last lines. Anyone could've predicted that Bella and Edward would end up together. The author promised it would be so, and I'm glad it worked out for the characters, but the way it happened was unnatural and too extreme and too randomly-contrived.    This is my opinion, of course, and Breaking Dawn has not ruined my respect for the author, but unlike the previous books, I don't think it's something I'd read over and over again if I had the choice.

There is history, which I need, and this collection of letters are heartwarming and very clever.  I truly enjoyed being able to chuckle and kept wishing I could talk to friends about it while I was reading.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|This movie is another in a line of sequels to Die Hard. This movie could continue with as many sequels as they want and I would watch them. Bruce Willis is HOT! I love him when he is dirty and sweaty. He is a believable common man hero. He doesn't go through mud and dirt and fighting and in the next scene be squeaky clean. The price is great and I was pleased with the unrated version.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|I listen to Fleet Foxes new cd as I type this. I recently happen to be flipping through the TV channels and heard them on the David Letterman Show - AMAZING! The song was \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" my favorite song as soon as I heard it! I knew I had to buy this CD because it was GOING TO BE GOOD. Yep, it sure is. The folk music will enchant you. It seems you can do almost anything while listening to this CD. I could study or be painting while listening to Fleet Foxes. It somehow takes you back in time to a place when music had meaning. The last song \\"Oliver James\\" will get your attention a bit more. Make sure to read the insert slip provided which holds the CD. In listening to the CD you can tell the band is very in tune and passionate about their music. This CD wasn't slapped together carelessly like most music is today. Make sure to ADD FLEET FOXES to your collection! I hope they tour and I can't wait for another cd in the future!<br />Thanks go out to FLEET FOXES for a \\"enchanting\\" CD!

B00006RINF|5.0|Good basic rythms, worthy of classic rock or metal. Great vocals that interchange male to female from verse to chorus. He has a slight raspy feel, but not any annoying cookie monster crap, while she is just angelic sounding. The music also has a slight goth tinge, but what rock/metal  band hasn't tinged their music with something ? It's not too much that it will keep a non gothic fan from liking it, but maybe just maybe enough for the goth fan. The music also has a slight atmospheric feel to it at times, I think it's her voice, along with the touch of keyboards in the background at times. A solid album without fillers.

Problem with a lot of hardcore metalheads is that they can't venture out of their narrow views, and I say that as someone who has been a Metal fan for many years, but not ONLY a metal fan.     The album is a bit too long, some more quality control could have been exercised and it would have been a 5-star 60-minute album.     No, it's no Master of Puppets, but it's not meant to be !

031606792X|1.0|After reading several other reviews, I'm going to try to make this as helpful as possible without repeating the same things as everyone else. I've noticed that many reviewers are ranting about how the Twilight Universe was wrecked, etc. Personally, I thought Eclipse gutted the series already. Eclipse degraded the entire atmosphere into mere high school melodrama. After that trainwreck, I was at least pleased that SM could keep a story moving (not progressing mind you, but moving). I'm not mocking devastated readers, just saying that since I had rock-bottom expectations to begin with, maybe I can offer a critique with a different angle. I'll try less to nitpick about individual events and more to question broader topics.    I would just like to start out by  saying that I'm sixteen, and an ex-rabid fangirl at that. Yes, I used to be one of those glossy-eyed teens fantasizing about Edward, which I don't doubt makes you all want to vomit in your mouth. I'd only admit that to prove how awful this book truly is. Eclipse snapped me out of it, and I realized how shallow and vacuous the Twilight world had become. Now I can actually provide a fairly objective review, and not reduce myself to a babbling preteen post kissing Meyer's feet.    Before I begin, I had various observations while reading that don't fit into any specific category, but are really just reactions, and I was wondering if anyone felt the same way:  The wedding was cookie-cutter cliché, even for SM. The reception was the equivalent of a bad high school dance. Bitter ex-boyfriend (essentially Jacob) is upset because someone else wants to sleep with his ex, and a fight almost breaks out.. New boyfriend consoles her, and that's it. The honeymoon was bland, and another question: if Edward was afraid of sex hurting Bella, and it didn't, what was the real point of waiting until marriage besides their little pact? Some say it's the influence of Meyer's religion, but either way I say it was just a pointless wasteof suspense. Oh, and the sex begging thing was really pathetic...they just got married, and she's already at his feet? The only thing Jacob's POV managed to do was keep us away from the center of the plot at the most critical time. The delivery was like some horror scene from a corny sci-fi movie And then Bella's transformation...I'm willing to guess that if Bella had accidentally received the venom by way of a hickey, it still would have been more tasteful than that grotesque birth scene . The Seth-Jacob-Leah bond was cute , but too complicated without enough background. Of all people, why did Alice have to leave? SM succeeded in purging the last shred of normality and  charisma from the household. Why was Charlie allowed to know the secret? He didn't contribute anything; he became a target and acted like a deer in the headlights. I started LOL at \\"The fetus adores Bella. It told me it doesn't want to hurt her.\\" Jumping the shark much? And come on, ending with a make out scene? Please, spare my gag reflex.  Now to focus on the actual analysis of the book.    First, let's get all the obvious stuff out of the way. The things that have been brought up so many times, but are so glaring I can't help but touch on them:  Bella is quite possibly the most boring protagonist ever created, even for a failboat protagonist. Bella gets everything she wants with no consequences. Renesmee is a terrible and uncreative name. The pregnancy thing made no sense, especially considering Meyer broke her own rules for her own universe (she even stated on her website---and took time to clarify---that vampires have only venom in their bodies, hence no sperm or semen). The books are incredibly sexist and poisonous to young vulnerable girls. Jacob imprinting on Bella's baby is all kinds of wrong, and incredibly awkward (he made out with her mom and pictured Mommy naked, and now he wants to marry her daughter?). It was exactly like a bad fanfiction. Most of the book focused on Bella's new senseof duty as a mother, which most of her readers can't relate to. Edward and Bella's relationship faded into standard clichés, not that it hasn't before, but it just completely became robotic and flatlined. Bella's \\"power\\" was lame, and I'm pretty sure it ripped off Violet from The Incredibles. (Really, watch the movie...right down to the scene where she worries her shield can't cover all of her family and forces it to expand at the last second). Stephenie Meyer is a cop-out who stretched too far to force the pieces together to make a happy ending. Who decided this was the last book, anyway?    To be immature for one second, where was the sex??? SM uses the excuse that children read this, but if she were so concerned with their innocence, she wouldn't have devoted page after page to describing Edward's perfect body or intimate make out sessions. I understand this series isn't smut, but SM, you tease us with this immaculate super-hunk for about 1500 pages thus far, and all you can give us is \\"we drifted deeper into the water\\" \\"he moaned and we rolled over\\" and \\"as our bodies intertwined into one\\"? And afterwards lame innuendo like pillow feathers, torn lingerie and a broken headboard? Plus, Bella can't recall anything specific...that would be inappropriate. You've GOT to be kidding me.   As someone pointed out: Sure, sex is taboo, but having Bella vomit blood while a mutant fetus gnaws through her uterus, why that's tame.    Moving on, I was disappointed as a reader in general. SM's writing reads like butter, not because it's always interesting, but because it's simple and  expected. SM cannot do male narration whatsoever. Her Jacob sounds exactly like Bella, but with more slang. The entire third \\"book\\" was people talking about the upcoming \\"fight\\" which was  barely a standoff. Normal books coast, build, climax, fall, then resolve. SM's books build for hundreds of pages, climax for no more than ten, and then awkwardly stagger to a conclusion. It's boring, because every paragraph gets off farther and farther into an obscure tangent of information until Stephenie's literally just talking to herself. I read 200 pages listening to this doomsday bloodbath prophecy (who is she fooling? we all knew they'd live), and it ended with \\"oh no, we were wrong. Guess we can't massacre you anymore\\" Not to  mention that had the most anticlimactic ending ever (Alice happens to burst through the trees with the one thing that can save them, how lucky). Anyway, you can't do that repeatedly and keep a book, a series, interesting. Come on, the same FIELD where they fought in the last book? The climax of all four books is a battle between good vs. evil vampires, and everyone wants to kill Bella. Despite the fact that all she does is cling to Edward and has no individual life anymore.     Speaking of Bella's individuality, what happened? Yes, since Twilight she's always been a leech on Edward, but in BD, her life faded away. Jessica, Angela, Ben, Mike, Tyler, Renee? Where are they? I think part of the reason I liked Twilight was because Edward existed in a normal atmosphere. Bella had friends, school, and normal boy drama, and Edward thrived and interacted with it all. Her world with Edward and the Cullens was separate and secret, but they could mix. It added another dynamic, and made Edward more mysterious because he wasn't normal or constant. For all of BD, it was either Bella and Edward or Bella in a house  talking to the same eight people. The relationship became nothing  special because he was there all the time. Edward can only spout love clichés for so long before the magic wears off. There was nowhere left to go because now they have sex all night long, and that's apparently the peak of their relationship.    I was also disappointed as an amateur writer. We all know SM's style is terrible, but I'm going beyond that. In my opinion, any writer truly devoted to their story places the characters out on a stage, for the reader to see and interpret and bond with. Does the author have the right to determine the outcome? Absolutely. Is it going to please everyone? No, that's impossible. But they have to allow the readers to watch the play. It's their job to build a foundation, keep the actors consistent, and above all: invite the readers in to draw their own conclusions. SM's major problem is she  puts her whims directly into the plots and characters, so continuity is ruined. She wants to control exactly how the reader sees every aspect of the series. Her own desires destroy any shred of affection we may have for any part of the series. For example, the majority didn't care about the middle of New Moon at all, because Edward wasn't there. But Edward had to run away, she insisted, even though that contradicted the entire message of Twilight. So we endured that. And in Eclipse, most people wanted Bella with Edward, and a few wanted her with Jacob. But Stephenie didn't want either of them, so Bella flip-flopped for 400 pages. You can't please every reader, but you  have to acknowledge their participation. Stephenie doesn't care what we think, and hasn't since the success of Twilight. She'd rather turn loyal fans away than entice new ones in. She didn't write Breaking Dawn for us; BD was a 754 page self-pity party, mourning the deaths of all her rapidly deteriorating brainchildren and her only source of income. She wrote the book for herself...it's especially obvious when she brings in all the foreign vampires she never bothered to mention before. At that point, she had stopped the story and was just scribbling down every random vampire fantasy she's ever had. The Twilight Saga is SM's world, and we're not welcome.    That being said, if SM is going to control her series so tightly, the world she creates has to be consistent. Without consistency, there's no legitimacy. That's why so many fanfics are laughable, because they ignore the principles of the Twilight Universe and are seen as ridiculous. As soon as Bella's pregnancy became viable, the book lost all credibility. Also the part where Bella was the only newborn vampire ever to be able to resist human blood, though SM devoted entire chapters to describing the uncontrollable bloodlust of all newborns. SM could've added that Irina was reborn from her ash pile or that Bella needed human food after her transformation, both of which her rules deemed impossible. Once there was a breech, all boundaries disappeared. The plot became flimsy since any principles for the series were undermined.    What was surprising was that after Bella became a vampire, her character became even more hollow. Meaning that once her body was perfected, she didn't have a niche anymore. The entire series was based on Bella being the damsel in distress, but she was no longer clumsy and no longer vulnerable. Her character became mother and mother only, but her trend toward martyrdom was bizarre, considering the rest of the books had showcased her supposed incapacity to make her own decisions or defend even herself. It became boring because Bella was yet again a vessel for another character. I'm not saying that motherly devotion is boring, but since most of SM's readers haven't experienced it, we need something other than the bond alone to understand Bella's character shift. Something about Renesmee had to captivate us and make us just as devoted and protective of her as Bella was. What we ended up with was a beautiful precocious child. So? That's nothing new as far as books go. Renesmee had no substance...we were expected, commanded to adore her basically because she was pretty and Edward's child. At least when Bella was a vessel for Edward we knew who he was and understood her commitment; we knew the facets of his personality and their relationship. Renesmee was barely a character and treated as a golden egg employed as the catalyst for action. She had no depth; she was merely a cause-and-effect agent.    On that same topic, it's sad that Bella had to become an invalid though pregnancy for her to gain any sort of maturity or likeability. That whole Jacob-stud thing was just....wow, like many other reviewers I'm not even going to go there, especially after the imprinting fiasco. Did anyone else feel that neither Bella nor Edward really parented? Jacob and Rosalie always had Renesmee, and it felt like Bella and Edward only came in contact with her to mope \\"Oh, our poor baby is going to die!\\" after which they wouldn't touch her for the next 20 pages. Speaking of Rosalie, it was a shame that the change in her relationship with Bella was never explained. It switched to stupid Jacob, where she was suddenly Bella's midwife. It went back to Bella, and I expected some filling in. Instead of a recollection of their bonding, we see Rosalie simply as Bella's on-hand nanny. No heart-to-heart, nothing. I understand that Rosalie wanted a taste of motherhood, but is that all? Where's the healing between her and Bella?  Are we supposed to believe that Rosalie only tolerated Bella to reap the rewards of Bella's last piece of humanity? That goes against the bonding started between them in Eclipse (plus the scene where Rosalie offered to do Bella's wedding hair) so I guess that means they're friends now. Still, the lack of any gratitude or camaraderie between them leaves the reader with a big question mark.    I also thought that the \\"Now I love you the right way\\" speech Jacob gave to Bella after imprinting and Bella saying \\"we got off track\\" was Stephenie's lame way of hastily apologizing for the mutilation that is now the Bella-Jacob relationship. Are we supposed to assume that in Eclipse, the egg in Bella that would become Renesmee was attracted to Jacob, so that's why Bella made out/fell in love with him? It was odd that Jacob and Edward went from being romantic rivals to Edward calling Jacob \\"my son\\". Jacob is Edward's family now just because he gave Edward's infant daughter a promise ring (who does that?) and isn't lusting after his wife anymore? Yeah, that's healthy.    Even though I'm going to leave the subject of feminism generally untouched (seeing as many have already cried foul with the sexism and Bella's status as a questionable \\"role model\\"), I do have to point out that having Bella completely \\"save the day\\" at  the end seemed like Meyer's halfhearted attempt to appease disgruntled female readers. The girl couldn't lift a finger before without injuring herself and almost dies in every book, but when there's no actual fight, she's the key factor....for intimidation. Riigght. It sent the message that you can only be useful if you're above average, since she defended everyone with her magical shielding powers.    Again, why does Bella almost die in EVERY book? Bella's always weak, Bella's always helpless, Bella's always unconscious fighting the pull of death. Give me a break, SM. She's supposed to be a damsel in distress, not a chronic vegetable.    This has nothing to do with any theme, but I have to mention: There was a line from the book. The night before the wedding, Bella thinks to herself \\"Attention is an inevitable part of life\\". To anyone who knows the series, that line pretty much represents every flaw and crack in the unraveling of the Twilight world. Stephenie fostered an impossible and mysterious universe. Now, not only is the protagonist herself so petty that she takes it for granted, but she refuses to enjoy even the basic pleasure of marriage. The guests will be warm, gracious, and doting, all of which Bella finds just plain unpleasant. This was our heroine...and there you have it.    So, should you bother reading Breaking Dawn? Well, probably not after you read my review. I tried to cover almost everything. If you want to laugh at 700-odd pages of a sappy teen melodrama, go for it. But in all seriousness, it actually is fascinating if you want an example of how an author can send her own brainchild into a tailspin of devolution. SM's characters began as dynamic and unique enigmas in Twilight. They suffered repeated retardation instead of growth, so that by the end of Breaking Dawn, they were reduced to your average spoiled and shallow teens. The Twilight Saga is a perfect representation of an author's fluctuations and metamorphoses , unfortunately for the worse in this case. All in all, I'd say read Twilight alone, and bask in its natural and easy feel. After that, Stephenie took it by the reins and led it in too many directions, so it crumbled.    Remember anyone over the age of twelve: this is an opportunity. If ever you get bored, produce an elementary-level story. Then throw in a hot guy, a spoiled teen girl, and some sort of supernatural creature (I call leprechauns!). Add some danger and suspense, a little foreplay and some sex, and VOILA! You too can be a millionaire!

031606792X|1.0|Sure, the book was soapy. But it will be followed by this stunning conclusion to the series...<br /><br />--\\"Shattering Dreams\\"--<br /><br />Outline: Nessie is now six years old, which makes her human 16. She hates her perfect home and her bourgeois parents who have everything but never worked for it. She hates this creepy, doggy-eyed, nine years older, uneducated loser who can't leave her alone and is now always trying to get under her pants. She joins a drug-taking Goth cult, just to upset her parents. Unfortunately, all the cult's males adore her for her beauty. But she is also very dangerous. During a ritual night, she sucks the incredibly tasty smelling cult leader to his death. Charlie tries to hide  evidence that his granddaughter committed the murder (the victim is Jessica's younger brother), but is caught at it and kicked out of town. Under the immense pressure of his clan, doggy-eyes decides to kill himself, so his clan can take measures against the threat to the community that Nessie has become. Since jumping off a cliff is no solution (he heals too fast), the creature that formerly was Jacob visits the Volturi, but instead of killing him, their guard Chelsea makes him the Volturi's first guard dog. His clan remains helpless against Nessie. Meanwhile, Nessie's actions have shattered the peace in her parents' home, causing rows between Edward and Bella over what to do with her. But Nessie is not done yet. Not knowing of the new situation, Renee and Robert have sent their spoiled five year old son to stay with the Cullens and their beautiful grandchild over the summer. Nessie can't stand him and, in full goth outfit, piercings and all, bites him, thus creating an immortal child. When the onslaught of the Volturi begins (climax), the werewolves refuse to fight for the Cullens again. Carlisle, Esme, Jasper, Emmett and - tragically - also Edward loose their lives, Edward being killed by the now-guard-dog Jacob, who is in turn killed by Bella. Alice, who has failed to foresee any of Nessie's actions, is taken prisoner by the Volturi who make her one of their own, as they long desired. Bella and Rosalie flee together into the Amazon rain forest, where they spend eternity blaming each other over what went wrong with the child. Nessie, who fled the scene before the arrival of the Volturi, repents her actions, decides to embrace her half-human nature and eat only human food, thereby loosing her special scent and, conveniently, the Volturi. She first joins a Toronto hippie commune, starts going to evening school, discovers her talent for mathematics, goes to college and eventually becomes the chief editor for a renowned scientific book publisher in New York.any of Nessie's actions, is taken prisoner by the Volturi who make her one of their own, as they long desired.

B0009VRHLK|5.0|This movie will leave you feeling numb.<br />Seriously, viewers who aren't fond of their safe little comfort zones being horrendously discombobulated and shattered into tiny pieces need to stay far away from this one.<br /><br />It's about a guy named Bud Clay, who is a competitive motorcycle racer that is constantly running away from his inner demons.<br />I will admit, much of this movie is uneventful. It just shows Bud wallowing in his own loneliness and detachment as he travels across the country to his next race. You're left wondering what has left him so flustered. This stagnant narrative is actually a perfect setup, it all culminates in an ending that is so emotionally searing, so graphically shocking and sad, I'm still trying to recover.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br />The end has an explicit oral sex scene performed by Chloe Sevigny. The Amazon editorial review labeled this graphic scene as completely unneccessary. I understand their opinion, but I think they might be overlooking a startling point. It's much more than a repulsive or gratuitous deed. That act totally amplifies the shock, helps to roughly seize a piece of the earth-shattering, debilitating events that haunt the main character. Truly disturbing.<br /><br />Nothing beats an arthouse film for jarring your emotions in an unconventional manner. I implore you to watch this with caution.
0743482832|5.0|As Shakespeare's final play, The Tempest is appropriately a culmination of his motifs and themes amassed beforehand in previous work. You have the jester, the underhanded political aspirants, the outcast, the young naive fools hopelessly in lust, and the omniscient schemer behind it all. What may have disappointed Elizabethan audiences may have actually been this mix, since it was such a combination that it felt more as if the plot was just regurgitating old plot devices but rest assured, the Bard works up a fine troupe of spirits under a firm lead to work our minds.<br /><br />The story involves the shipwreck of Italian nobles that leaves them unscathed and in even better condition than on the ship save the fate of King Alonso's son Ferdinand. Meanwhile, the wizard Prospero calls upon his spiritual underling Ariel and receives confirmation that his revenge upon those who sentenced his exile has begun.<br /><br />Like all Shakespearean characters, they're real to the point that you may be disgusted at them and later realize how close you are with their vices. With a seeming reunion of all his characters, this makes for a perverse tale. Prospero commands a wide array of spells to delight and fright but once his tale of woe is told, it's pitiful that his learned nature led him to exile and pettiness and by the story's end he's the same. Antonio and Sebastian are heartless fiends who've only a mind for power by any means and even knowing this, we laugh at their sniping witty wordplays with their fellow nobles, particularly the saintly Gonzalo. Caliban is a tragic figure demonstrating the evils of colonial enslavement and even then his misadventures with the drunken self-proclaimed celestial monarch Stephano and Trinculo, the smart fool, so to speak, make great comedy.<br /><br />There's a great scene where Prospero realizes that Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo want to kill him, comic characters all against a wizard, and he takes it seriously. It's rightfully absurd but when his previous dictatorial behavior towards his deluded and imprisoned servants is recalled, it calls to mind Of Mice and Men, where Slim says, \\"Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella.\\"<br /><br />When Stephano says to Caliban, \\"Come, kiss the book!\\" with a booze bottle, we realize just how intoxicating the Bard was and are tempted to leave it at that. But when bookworms and literary professors are observed in the throes of their obsession, maybe it's not such a ludicrous comparison after all.torial behavior towards his deluded and imprisoned servants is recalled, it calls to mind Of Mice and Men, where Slim says, \\"Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella.\\"    When Stephano says to Caliban, \\"Come, kiss the book!\\" with a booze bottle, we realize just how intoxicating the Bard was and are tempted to leave it at that.

No, seriously, I'm so worried that it will get scratched that I just ordered two more copies.<br /><br />I was a Who fan. This DVD turned me into a raving Who fan. It starts out with a bang (a real one, complete with drum shrapnel and burning hair) and ends with a blistering live performance of WGFA (Won't Get Fooled Again) from 1978 -- Keith Moon's last public performance with the band. There's also a live version of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" from the same session in 1978, and magical footage from Woodstock of Daltrey singing \\"See me, hear me, touch me, feel me\\" as the sun breaks over the horizon and floods the stage. Makes me want to have been there even more than Hendrix's performances do.<br /><br />I just watched \\"Live at Isle of Wight\\" (as well as the Woodstock footage), and the '78 live versions of Baba and WGFA are every bit as electric as the performances in '69 and '70.<br /><br />The bonus material is also fascinating: if you look at what they did during the restoration and audio cleanup of the original release, your jaw will be hanging on the floor (if you like such things).<br /><br />This deserves twice as many stars as I can give it. No offense to anyone who doesn't like it, but how that's possible is beyond my comprehension.<br /><br />Long live rock.<br /><br />P.S. You should also get your hands on the DVD about the making of Who's Next: amazing, truly amazing -- behind the scenes info from Townshend, Glyn Johns, and many other people involved with the production of the record. It answers a lot of questions, like \\"Is that a *violin* at the end of Baba O'Riley?\\" (Yes, played by Dave Arbus) and \\"Is that a synth loop?\\" (No, but you'll have to listen to Glyn Johns's explanation because I don't quite understand it)
B000W04S6U|5.0|You know music is great if it gives you goosebumps and chills down your spine. That's what happened to me when I listened to the Ending suites. Marty and Mikey did a fantastic job polishing and rearanging old and new music for this, the final game in the Halo trilogy.<br /><br />Let's not forget the packaging either. The two disc case has the classic look of the previous releases yet with a bit of a darker feel. The Arbiter and Master Chief adorn the first disc and The Chief and Cortana adorn the second disc, both discs featuring the characters in a dull shadowy color to keep with the dark mood.<br /><br />In short, there isn't much here that I don't like. I highly recomend.
032147404X|4.0|The information in the book was very helpful, easy to read and had great tips.
031606792X|5.0|I am probably one of few men who read this series of amazing novels. Out of all the books, none of the sequels have quite lived up to the masterpiece that is Twilight, but it is nonetheless a satisfying read. Stephenie Meyer has created a world beyond the imaginings of anyone else on earth and needs to continue the series in the near future in some way, shape or form.
B0002OXVDW|3.0|It is fun to see a lot of these great Hollywood (that is, MGM) musicals and the stars performing. The main annoyance is that the  narrators frequently speak while the sequences are beginning and they end up being clips rather than the whole performance as seen in the original film. At some point I wish they'd just show the performances and not have any narrators.
6301247485|4.0|As with any movie that's based on a book, the book will always be superior. I've seen all the Gatsby movies, and this is by far the best one. I can't think of anyone better to play Jay Gatsby than \\"The Natural\\", Robert Redford. Mia Farrow played a good Daisy Buchanan, as Farrow's over-acting, exaggeratedly-dramatic hallmark fit well in her character. Sam Waterston played a great Nick, as the objective third party between Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan (Bruce Dern). I suggest that every read the book by F. Scott Fitzgerald of course before you watch the movie. The 1949 movie with Alan Ladd and Betty Field was okay, and the 2000 made-for-TV movie with Toby Stephens was decent, but this one was superb.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|3.5 stars.  Granted, I'm not a huge Bond fan.  The ones I've seen over the years late 80's on up have all had very forgettable storylines.  I'm not sure that this one will be all that memorable either-but I like the new complexties of this Bond.  There's a sense of a wounded soul and I find that appealing instead of the easy flirtatious playboy. The only thing is despite the terrific body Craig looks too stiff and unbelivable in the love scenes.  I didn't believe for a moment the sudden love story.  In fact when he started talking about being in love, I started frowning at the screen and wondering if I missed something.  The final scene was also anti-climatic.  Still I liked it better than the Bronson films.
0061150142|4.0|First of all, I *hate* that so many of the other reviews basically give away the story / punchline.<br /><br />Okay, now:  I read (actually listened to the recorded format of) \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" before this one.  Maybe it was just because of that experience with Ms. Picoult's writing, but I \\"got\\" this one WAAAAAAY early.  It was like cassette three (out of 12, again recorded format) that I had the ending figured out.  And therefore, all through the last nine tapes, I kept looking for the \\"hook\\", the surprise that was going to throw me off of what I had guessed, and it never came.  So that left me REALLY disappointed with \\"The Pact\\".<br /><br />I think the \\"Emily\\" character is developed FAR too little.  As other reviewers have said (and I can repeat, without giving away \\"spoilers\\"), I just didn't buy what was given as her reasons for being suicidal.  It just wasn't it.  Anyone who has ever been depressed or suicidal can easily read this book and KNOW that \\"Emily\\" isn't it -- and most likely, have a good idea that Ms. Picoult doesn't really understand depression or what it is like to be suicidal (and lucky for her!, though perhaps too bad for her books).<br /><br />In any case, \\"The Pact\\" by itself, is pretty good, and well worth the time to read/listen.  If, however, you have been through \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", I would say don't bother with this -- the parallels are too obvious, the plot is (perhaps) a giveaway, and the ending is likely to be disappointing.  And, without going into details, I found there were a LOT of holes in the plot line -- dots that never got connected, or just seemed too disjointed, out of place, or otherwise didn't make sense.<br /><br />Just one other random thought:  the picture/art on the cover, to me, REALLY doesn't seem to fit the book; and for that matter, neither does the title -- \\"The Pact\\"?!??  Puh-leeeze!  I don't know what else to suggest, but \\"The Pact\\" is woefully inadequate.<br /><br />Still, if this is your first Picoult novel, go for it!  She's a good writer!

B0013FXWU6|4.0|Director Paul Thomas Anderson does another period piece, skipping further back in time then he did with his famous 1997 work \\"Boogie Nights\\".  This time, the destination is the United States in the early years of the 20th century, with a brief epilogue set some time after the Wall Street crash of 1929.  The subject is the California oil industry, based (very, very loosely) on Upton Sinclair's famous book \\"Oil!\\".  The character is Daniel Plainview, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in his second Oscar-winning role.    The story follows Plainview as he pursues his dream of earning enough money to separate himself forever from other people, who he despises as a general rule.  He has a son, H.W., who he actually does care for, though at the same time he loves money; one is reminded of one analysis of Shylock that said that the most charitable thing to be said about his attitudes was that if he didn't put his daughter before his ducats, at least the reverse wasn't true.  Plainview is given a hot tip by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) about huge amounts of oil in his home town, and hurries to buy up all the neighbouring areas.  The major other character is Eli Sunday (also Dano), a would-be evangelical preacher and miracle-worker.  If Plainview is brutal capitalism, Sunday is fundamentalist religion (recalling the huckster faith-healers of later decades).  As business grows, the conflict between the two grows based on minor acts of spite and conflicting worldviews.    The character of Plainview is the movie, basically.  As played by Day-Lewis, in a volcanic performance, he is a mass of contradictions and impulses: he genuinely cares for his son, but at the same time he is driven by greed for money.  When his son becomes deafened in an accident, Plainview first cannot stay beside him because of the accident, and later, struggling to deal with it, sends him away to the city.  In what I think Plainview regards as Sunday's most offensive act, he forces him to face up to this action and showgenuine weakness and desperation to escape the possible wrath of God.  Plainview later reenacts this scene at the climax, with the roles reversed, to remarkable effect.  Occasionally, he explodes into violence, particularly when family is brought up; as he relates to one character who later falls victim to this violence, he doesn't like people, and at times he seems like he does want to reach out.  Ultimately, though, he is a cynical, vengeful, black-hearted old man that Ebenezer Scrooge would be appalled by.    Anderson and his crew meticulously reconstruct the time period, conveying the many dangers faced by the pioneer workers in the early oil industry.  More than one many dies a grisly death as a result, and blows sting the audience as sharply as the bolts from Anton Chigurh's airgun.    On another note, this is often called an adaptation of Sinclair's \\"Oil!\\", but it is not, really.  Anderson takes one or two ideas from the novel, perhaps, but among other things, the names are all changed (Plainview and Sunday have been given Meaningful Names in lieu of the more ordinary Ross and Watkins), an the plot is different, focussing on the father character.  Most significantly, the moral of the story is completely reversed: the tycoon in Sinclair's novel is a genuinely likeable figure who is corrupt and brutal because the system is corrupt and brutal.  Anderson remakes this to the story of a sociopath who is rotten because of his own nature, with the system itself apart from him seen much more benignly.  There are mentions made of monopolies held by men like John D. Rockefeller, but all the other characters seem reasonable and cower in fear of Plainview.  Not that it isn't a good movie, but it seems a strange adaptation that completely changes the meaning of one of the great social commentators of the 20th century.    All in all, I quite quite liked this movie; as a film, I felt it was much more wholistic than the Coens' \\"No Country For Old Men\\" (though my personal vote for the Oscar would have been \\"Atonement\\").
032147404X|3.0|I bought this book (Digital Photography) along with  The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography.    The Betterphoto Guide was a lot better.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was really everthing I wanted it to be. It is a great and wonderful love story. The twist and turns in the storyline were amazing. This book was my favorite of the all series. I just wish that Stephenie would continue the series with more POVs. I totally didn't expect the major twist to the book, but that twist really made the book. In Breaking Dawn, I really connected more with all the characters than I did with the other three books. Love between Bella and Edward was just AMAZING. All women want to find that type of love in their lifetime. Stephenie did a wonderful job with the honeymoon scene and love between the family and friends. I really don't understand why we don't like the book. What's there not to like. You have action, love, romance, and a great story all in one book. I thank Stephenie for all that she has given us and pray she will continue the series with other POVs. I can't wait for Midnight Sun. Stpehenie, you totally rock...
B00005JPY0|5.0|In 2005, Christopher Nolan relaunched Warner Brothers' dormant Batman franchise with \\"Batman Begins\\", an exceptionally well-made film that took a realistic, detailed approach to the origins of DC's biggest hero (arguably the most popular hero in the world).  Now, three years later, Nolan and his star Christian Bale return to the property, and they deliver what is perhaps the greatest superhero film ever made (and a great film, besides), on ethat will become the model all others will look up to.    The first movie ended on an optimistic note: Batman had saved the city, and had \\"really started something\\", in Gordon's words: however, one tease at the end (the Joker's playing card) hinted at the violent chaos to come in the next movie.  And here, Nolan delivers on that, in the form of the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that is already becoming legendary.  Gordon closed the last film with a prediction that Batman's presence would lead to escalation in the criminal community.  He was right.  The desperate Gotham mafia (a coalition of Slavic, African-American, and Italian gangsters) turn to the Joker to deal with Batman before he brings them all down.  The Joker enacts a campaign of terror designed to smoke Batman out: the caped crusader and his chief allies, DA Harvey Dent and Police Commissioner Gordon (the first film's Commissioner Loeb is among the Joker's first victims), along with assistants Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox, must deal with this embodiment of chaos.  Dent, as well, is romancing Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a superior replacement for Katie Holmes).    Nolan and his screenwriters draw on several different comics sources to create their vision of Batman, the Joker, and Gotham.  The most obvious among these are Alan Moore's \\"The Killing Joke\\" (perhaps the seminal Batman vs. Joker story) and Jeph Loeb's \\"Batman: The Long Halloween\\", which involved Harvey Dent and the struggle between Batman and the mob.  Moore's Joker was conceived of as having nofixed origin, and Nolan follows throuhg with this: the Joker has no origin, though he offers several different versions to different people.    Conversely, the film diverges noticeably from the comics in its depiction of Two-Face.  There is no split personality in evidence, nor any of the psychological problems that said personality springs from.  Two-Face has more or less been cut down to his gimmick, and then a new rationale for the gimmick constructed to suit the themes of the film.  Eckhart is very compelling as this version, which also sports some effectively grisly makeup/effects.    \\"Batman Begins\\" was notable for being the first Batman film to really be about Batman, instead of being a showcase for various freakshow villains; this is dialled back a bit in this film, where the villains take more of a centre-stage.  Batman still has a significant character arc, but the story is less about him; notice that the buzz surrounding the movie centres on Ledger, not Bale.  That Batman is less of a focus is not a bad thing in and of itself, so long as the villains are well-done, which they are.  Caine, Freeman, Oldman, and Gyllenhaal are all effective supporting cast.    One of the most notable things about this film is its ability to make the audience doubt the outcome, bringing the storytelling styles that have flourished in the comics industry for at least twenty years to the big screen at last; Spider-Man succeeded in 2002 where he failed in the comics in 1973, but now the audience is never sure whether Batman's allies will reliably make it out alive.  It's a jolt that one hopes will allow future comics adaptations to reach the greater diversity of outcomes that the comics currently enjoy.    A bravura effort from all involved.
076535618X|4.0|This is John Scalzi's third book in the series and just like the previous two this is something special - but I guess all his works are. Once more we're allowed into the realm of John Perry and Jane Sagan, but unlike the previous works, this time they are retired - and yes, it does change the overall feel of the story. The only knock against this book (and I'm reaching here) The ending was a bit stretched and the book focuses more on intrigue than sci-fi. Overall, this is an excellent finally to a political/sci-fi series that many will be disappointed that a fourth book is not in the works.<br /><br />For those who may have missed the first book, don't miss [[ASIN:1596061308 Old Man's War]]

But World without End is just porn and tedium set in the same universe.  Porn, tedium, tragedy x 1111 pages      I wish I hadn't read it, I feel its ruined POTE.    I don't want to read about how semen tastes, enough already!
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Why colorize Holiday Inn?  Although the film has no art decco or any other reason it should be in black and white, LOST will be:  The grey Christmas Trees with their black & white decorations.  New Years Eve, with the black & white baloons.  The giant grey Valentine heart that Astaire & Reynolds jump through.  The drab presentation of what should be a beautiful, colorful holiday film.    OF COURSE I'M BEING FACETIOUS!!!    If ever a film was meant to be in color, It's Holiday Inn.  While the film \\"White Christmas\\" is now a hoiliday classic, the film \\"Holiday Inn\\" is slipping into obsurity.  This only reason for this is because it was filmed in black & white.  In 1942 shooting a film in color added greatly to production costs, and would have cut into Paramount's profits (it brings a tear to my eye).  The film has now been colorized by Legend Films, which has been doing a fantastic job of colorization.  This set also includes the remastered black & white version of this film.  So let the anti-colorization crowd watch it black & white on Christmas Eve, while they add another lump of coal to the fire. Most of us will watch it in color, and will be tickled pink!

1400079276|3.0|Many years ago I read Murakami's \\"Wind-up Bird Chronicle\\" which left me absolutely spellbound. I loved the plasticity of its prose and the suggestive and surprising metaphors that where wrapped around the shadowy plot. Other Murakami novels that I have read since - \\"Hard-boiled Wonderland ...\\" and \\"South of the Border ...\\" - left me disappointed.<br /><br />The same is true, I am afraid, for \\"Kafka\\". The story has been conceived as a darkly allegorical account of a young boy's coming of age, sexual awakening and initiation rite. The first two hundred pages are promising, if not at the same level of the \\"Chronicle\\". But then Murakami seems to get lost in his own narrative labyrinth and the story becomes a wearying sequence of dreams and \\"teleportation experiences\\" (by want of a better word). Lots of it is merely clever and gratuitous - not tightly woven into the plot - and it soon wears off (a small and obvious example is the choice of `Kafka' as the protagonist's name, the initial frisson of which quickly fades). As a result many of the twists and turns in the narrative, even if they were not exactly predictable, left me cold. To me none of the \\"Kafka\\"-stuff comes close to the deeply serious, compelling, unforgettable epiphany of Lt. Mamiya in the \\"Chronicle\\".<br /><br />Neither is the prose at the same height of the earlier novel. There is too much that is simply mundane (after 500 pages of \\"Kafka\\" one has \\"a pretty good idea\\" (a typical Murakami turn of phrase) what range of options is available to Japanese for breakfast, lunch and dinner) and only seldomly Murakami achieves the poetic density of his best work.<br /><br />Pity. But I'll keep looking out for a worthy successor to the \\"Chronicle\\".

031606792X|5.0|I am not sure why people are being so hard on Stephanie Meyer's Breaking Dawn book.  It was a great end to HER story of Bella and Edward.  I loved the way we were able to see Bella grow up.  She no longer was this teenager but a married woman with a child.  I think that's the part people didn't like, but I thought it was the natural progression of her relationship with Edward.  I loved this book.  I really enjoy your books Stephaine, keep them coming!
1582701709|4.0|This book took me less than a week to read. The appearance of the book is wonderful. It is a good reminder on how the world works and the law of attractions. You should immediately feel good after reading this book, but the experience can be short-live if you don't take actions every day. The book can be a little repeatitive at times, though.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out, and remember all the crazy stuff that went on. Later it became a thing where we would rent it every so often and watch it, waiting for certain parts. It draws on a great cast, a strange script, and sets that fit the storys mood. Its a film that would never be made today because they would never bring in so many great actors, and hire a top notch screenplay writer. Its easier now to just get one known actor, or a script that relies on foul language and gross jokes with whoever starring in it. I enjoy that type of movie too, but this is not like that. This is a fun movie, thats the best way to describe it.
B00005JPD0|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from Tony Scott and this \\"science/fiction\\" movie.  I really enjoy Denzel Washington, but this plot was just too confusing and implausible.  I had to watch it a few times to try to \\"make it fit,\\" but I still didn't understand the ending.  Too many things just didn't make sense.  Although the acting was fine and the premise had great possibilities, the screenwriter couldn't quite put it all together.  It wasn't a very good job of either \\"science\\" or \\"fiction.\\"  Don't bother to watch this unless you're just dying to see Denzel in another movie.

031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn delivered!  This series was compelling, fun, and a good read.  It is fiction, and personally, I like my stories to have the cliched \\"happily ever after.\\"  Isn't this what we were all hoping for from the beginning -- Bella and Edward forever?  As least that is what I was waiting for and Stepenie Meyer delivered!

031606792X|1.0|Meyer has said that girls as young as eight read her books.  Well, this book felt like it was actually written by a prepubescent girl, so I'm sure those readers will love it.  After all, the main character is so mind-numbingly emotionally adolescent that all she can think about is a handsome face and \\"true love.\\"  I kept hoping that this would finally be the book where Bella matures - where she comes into her own.  Instead, she gets married and has a baby without the smallest ounce of gained maturity.  Toward the end of the book, you see moments that might be construed as Bella maturing through Renesmee.  I'm sorry, but you do not mature by having a baby.  Maturity comes first.      Forget the glaring plot holes, inconsistencies, and inappropriate subject matter. (I don't care who you are, but \\"imprinting\\" on an infant in no way belongs in a YA book.  It is far too mature for many young readers to fully understand.)  This is not the kind of message that should be sent to young girls.  You do not need a man to be happy.  You do not need to get married to be happy.  You do not need to have a baby to be happy.  And in the real world, things do not just tie up into a neat little bow.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|I saw this movie on Thursday, and bought the soundtrack on the way home from the theater!  I have listened to it non-stop for 3 days and still can't get enough of it.  Abba fans will truly love it, but anyone who likes musicals, for their catchy tunes and lyrics, will love this CD.  There are some slower numbers, but most jump right along.  If you liked the movie, you should have this soundtrack!  Crank this up while driving or doing housework - the time spent will FLY by!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|RAIN MAN is an excellent film that came out in 1988 when autism was relatively unknown.  Though no one person on the autism spectrum  is likely to exhibit all the traits Raymond Babbitt does Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of him is humane and relatively accurate.  Tom Cruise is also excellent as Raymond's handsome self absorbed brother, Charlie, and I had almost forgotten what an appealing actor Cruise was as a young man.  The plot is not too realistic but the movie is so well acted and the setting as the two men drive from Cincinnati to LA so well realized that it is difficult not to be absorbed in this good hearted film with a message.
B0018M6J90|3.0|I've just seen this film at the cinema and I enjoyed it very much. I wouldn't say it was fantastic, but it certainly wasn't useless either - somewhere in the middle. If you have enjoyed films such as 'The Truth About Being Earnest', you'll love this. Full of romance, comedy, and drama. You'll be laughing one minute, and feel like crying the next.     Set in 1940's Britain fastly approaching war, it follows the story of Miss Pettigrew, a middle age governess who once again has unfairly been sacked from her job. Unemployed and penniless she decides there is no other option but to seize the day, and finds herself working as social secretary to an aspiring young actress known as Delysia Lafosse. Well outside her comfort zone Miss Pettigrew is catapulted into the glamorous and social world-wind of high society. Taking her role to heart, the film is all about Miss Pettigrew trying to help and navigate Delysia's love life and career, by having learned from her own experiences. What she doesn't realise though, is that Delysia is also helping her...
0790731452|2.0|Yeah, I get that Tim Burton's star studded MARS ATTACKS! is a spoof of 1950's sci-fi movies but I still don't find this to be a very amusing film.  And I know it is all comic book violence/black comedy but there is still way too high of a body count (both Martian and Earthling) for me.  Do I personally find it amusing when a trailer dwelling Kansas couple watches their soldier son get vaporized on live television? Er No.  Or when a group of Cub Scouts are crushed by the Washington Monument? No again. I even have to say no to the enjoyment value of members of Congress being assassinated with ray guns while the president is killed in a manner reminiscent of the chest bursting scene in ALIEN.   Those are just some samples of the  Earthling casualties.  And when the Martians' heads begin to explode after hearing a certain type of music they leave quite an unpleasant gooey green substance in their wake.   Suffice it to say that this one is not for the kiddies.  Since this \\"comedy\\" lacks clever dialogue or amusing situations I can't recommend it for the adults either.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I enjoyed this miniseries so much that I just had to buy it.  I have since shared it with the rest of my family, and the response is always the same: Amazing attention to detail, and captivating from start to finish.  It pulls you back in time, and you can almost imagine yourself back when our country was struggling to free itself from the yoke of England's Monarchy. It was such a turbulent time to live, when the peoples' desire to be independent could have led to charges of treason against the Crown, and their deaths by hanging.     We are given insight to how the Congress was formed, and how it worked. The election of the President and Vice-President was quite interesting in how it was accomplished.... so much less complicated than what we have today! Politics in general hasn't changed much, though....    The producers have gone to great lengths to make the sets as close as possible to the actual places they are portraying. The actors have been transformed to what we today acccept as how these historical figures actually looked. If you want more detail, you can switch on the program that gives facts about the times, the people, the places, the customs, etc... as the movie plays. It is similar to what the miniseries \\"ROME\\" offered, and gives so much more information than from just watching the movie. There are also subtitles for those that need them.    The performances of Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, Stephen Dillane, and the rest of the cast, are top notch. Without the chemistry they project on screen, it could have been just another mediocre historical movie.  But they bring these historical figures to life, making them unforgettable!     I recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves history, or to anyone who wants to learn a little more of how our country was back in its infancy.  It is truly worth the price, which, I might add, Amazon.com beat every place else, hands down!

015206396X|5.0|This book I could not put down.  Okay, okay.  I put it down - twice - but reluctantly - and that was to eat and sleep.    I liked Katsa immediately.  I liked her companions.  Being \\"Omniscient Reader\\" I saw what she could not see and longed for her to see it too.  I ran with her, swam with her and endured forest and mountain and sea with her.    There were only two parts of the book that were slightly less than satisfying for me - the climax and the ending.  This sounds ominous but bear with me.    The climax:  Getting to the climax was brilliant, and I can't quite put my finger on why its conclusion was less than I expected.  It did everything it was supposed to and went the only way it could really, but there is this lingering sense that I was a bit cheated.  It seemed in a way to end abruptly which is strange in itself because there was quite a build-up.    The ending:  It was a long ending and anticlimactic.  However, it seems obvious (to me) that this book was written as the first of a series.  Acknowledging that - and acknowledging that I will be a most willing reader of the sequel - I cannot gripe with an ending that did not conclusively end.    Please note that nothing I said in the paragraphs above stopped me giving this book 5 stars.    I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all comers.
B000B5XOSO|3.0|With the success of 1989's \\"Batman\\", Warner Brothers obviously saw the potential for a franchise in this darker and more serious interpretation of the Dark Knight. Wasting little time in putting a sequel in motion, director Tim Burton (\\"Batman\\") and star Michael Keaton returned three years later to once more fight crime within Gotham City with \\"Batman Returns\\".    \\"Batman Returns\\" follows Batman's (Michael Keaton) continuing war on crime in and around Gotham City. After taking on the likes of the maniacal Joker, how could things possibly get any worse for Gotham and its caped crusader? When a grotesque new villain named Penguin (Danny DeVito) teams up with a sultry, feline-inspired femme fatale by the name of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), it seems that perhaps Batman may have met his match when he discovers just what they have planned for him and his beloved Gotham City.    The previous movie, \\"Batman\\", established a serious, obviously darker take on the title character than any of his previous incarnations outside of the comic books; but with \\"Batman Returns\\" everything seems to take a decidedly more wicked turn. The story written by Daniel Waters (\\"Demolition Man\\") was fairly solid for the most part, serving as a decent follow-up to the blockbuster original. The action seemed bigger in scope, the set pieces much more grand, though not breaking away from the design established in the first movie, and the characters were still kept front and center, never sacrificing plot or development for the sake of another action sequence. However, this much darker story (which I liked the overall direction this movie went) felt a little out of sorts in places, for a majority of the movie the story flowed very well, but there were several parts in the middle of the film where the story seemed to lose its focus. What I'm referring to are the portions of the story revolving around Penguin's bid for public office (a kind of interesting, although unbelievable plot point), for some reason these scenes really felt less polished, as if the writer just couldn't figure out how to work this aspect of the character's story arc into the big picture; therefore, leaving us with a mid-section of a movie that feels out of place, breaking the movie's steady pace down to almost a crawl at times.    Director Tim Burton clearly knew what it took to make a good Batman movie after doing so well with his first effort, but I wonder if in his attempt to equal what he had done with the original film, did he set himself up to fail with this one. The general progression for the character and this franchise would be to up the stakes to some degree, and with \\"Batman Returns\\" this happened all across the board, just to varying degrees of success. The story as I stated already was much darker than that of the original, a natural evolution for the character, so I was completely fine with that, the problem occurs when the main character receives less attention than supporting characters. Just like in \\"Batman\\", it appears that Bruce Wayne/Batman doesn't get near as much time on screen as the villains he is encountering. I understand that when you have two villains instead of one, more time will need to be spent on developing them as viable threats for our hero, and also to establish them as believable characters for the audience to connect with on some level; however, when the title character feels like an afterthought, I think the focal point of the movie has been lost. By including two villains, I feel that Tim Burton and his writer, Daniel Waters, couldn't figure out how to give equal time, or at least close it, to Batman without missing out on any development for their new characters. With this obvious problem, which was no doubt an unintended consequence of trying to be bigger and better than the previous movie, \\"Batman Returns\\" felt a little off in my opinion, and not nearly up to the standard previously established with \\"Batman\\".    Michael Keaton continues to buildon what he had done as Bruce Wayne/Batman, further establishing the discomfort Bruce has with his billionaire side as he awaits the time for darkness to fall over the city so that the Batman can once more prowl the rooftops of Gotham. This point was illustrated perfectly in the movie, when Bruce is sitting in his study by himself, not doing anything but sitting there, and the bat signal shines into the room and suddenly he comes to life. Without saying a single word, Michael Keaton was able to clearly portray exactly how the character was feeling and what it is that drives him in life. Danny DeVito (\\"Deck the Halls\\") was an ideal choice for Penguin, his smaller stature and heavier build makes him a nearly perfect fit for the general appearance of the villain, although it appeared that more weight was needed for the character's girth, because it is quite obvious a couple of times in the film that DeVito is wearing some sort of padding under his costume to make him look even larger. I've never really been all that impressed with Danny DeVito as an actor, I thought he was alright, but nothing all that great; however, as Penguin he really seemed to connect with the character, and something about his performance just worked and I was actually impressed with just how twisted and evil he was able to make the character become. Danny's version of Penguin was much more of a threat, and definitely more grotesque, than his previous incarnation on the 60's television series or even how he had appeared in the comic books. Michelle Pfeiffer (\\"Hairspray\\") did an excellent job of establishing two distinct sides to her character that are as different as night and day, by playing Selina Kyle as such a weak individual who can't defend herself and is constantly belittled by her boss (Christopher Walken), yet when she becomes Catwoman this entirely new side to her emerges, that is so much more aggressive and driven. I really liked the way the story intertwined both Selina's story and Catwoman's story so much that eventually she would be forced to choose which side would become dominant, because as much as she wants love and companionship, which she may have found in Bruce Wayne, her dual identity as the villainous Catwoman will prevent her from truly settling down, not to mention being a criminal puts her at odds with her lover's alter ego.    \\"Batman Returns\\" is a fairly solid sequel, containing a decent story, with a heftier dose of action (even though there seemed to be fewer fight scenes, the scenes were much longer than what had been done previously), and more great performances from the actors involved. However, a very slow midpoint in the film, caused by an uninteresting and unfocused character arc, forced the movie to lose momentum, which it struggled to get back and maintain for the remainder of the movie's duration.    \\"Batman Returns\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
0743454537|5.0|This was the first book I read by Jodi Picoult.  I picked up a signed hardcover edition on clearance at Borders by dumb luck.  Her writing is simple but very powerful, and the story seemed to be ripped from the headlines.  I couldn't put the book down and I couldn't quite guess at the ending, which is a rare treat for me.  I have come to read many of Picoults novels, and though I have a little trouble with the metaphysical and suspension of disbelief, they are all well-written.  Picoult does meticulous research into her subject, and I always learn a lot reading her.

0739367676|2.0|I just think Stephanie Meyers ruined it.  I was so into the first 3 books, and the part that just blew it for me in the 4th was the creation of Renesmee.  SO unneccesary.  I began to get completley annoyed with everyone hovering over Bella, and the whole Jake character needed to go away and stay away the first time he ran off as a werewolf to Canada.  It just got to be pathetic, and the imprinting on Renesmee, and the way Charlie just almost instantaneously accepted Bella's transformation to the point of watching a Basketball game...I couldnt read anymore.  I didnt care anymore.  The first 3 were great, number 3 being a favorite, but now I dont know if I could recommend a reader investing so much time for such a great letdown.  I mean please...she even become the most model perfect Newborn....what makes that an interesting read?

I kept waiting (hoping?) that Bella would wake up and it would all be a dream she'd had the night before her wedding.  No such luck. The baby storyline was completely ridiculous-and it was totally inconsistent with the rest of the series.  The Jacob imprinting thing was very creepy as well.  Like another reviewer said-you don't always get a nice happy ending with all the ends tied up.  I had high expectations for the end of this series...It really bummed me out to see what a mess it was.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|I have seen the original many times and was intriuged with the choices of who was chosen for the roles. And I wasn't dissapointed!<br />Depp sings with a passion and has a gravel that gives him an edge and feeling that is hard to put a finger on. Carter had a sad and more desperate sound to her singing that Angela did.<br />In fact the whole musical movie was filmed with a more serious note than the original was acted.<br />I prefer Toby, Anthony, and Johanna in the movie a hundred times over the acted version. Anthony in the play had this stupid grin on his face almost the whole play. He is entirely stupid in the play. Toby also seems dumbed down in the play, and I actually like Burton cutting off the last minutes from the play, with Toby going mad. And Johanna in the movie seems more trapped than the Johanna in the play. In the play she feels clingy and shrill.<br />The only thing that I do prefer in the play to the movie is Hearn's singing. I said that Depp's performance it good- it is. But Hearn's deep voice is hypnotic and powerful. That is the one thing that Depp lacks.<br />All in all, this movie is a wonderful adaptation to the play, and I will watch it more than the original.
B00004Y87O|5.0|Not really being familiar with the work of John Carpenter or the acting ability of Kurt Russell, I guess it can safely be said that I went into this movie blind. That, in many ways can be a good thing. I went in with little to no expectations and had no hopes about what I wanted to see. Little did I know that this movie would shock me beyond belief as to how genuinely good it was. Sure it was corny and sure, it was filled with the classic clich&eacute;'s that we've become familiar with from 80's movies. That didn't make it less entertaining. In fact it made it even more enjoyable than I could have possibly imagined.<br /><br />This movie had everything and more. It gave us suspense, a bit of horror, a chunk of emotion and a snippet of humour. They all blended together to create what eventually (from what I've learned recently) became a true cult classic. The characters have no real depth but deliver the personalities that made this movie work. Snake Plissken is the typical badass hero who cares for nobody else but himself until he's faced with particular situations. Brain who's the slimy guy who would sell anyone down the river for his own benefit. The only reason they haven't gotten rid of him is because he knows everything and supplies the criminals with oil. Let's not forget the Duke. He's the baddest of all the bad people in New York and, as the saying goes \\"you don't cross the duke.\\"<br /><br />The story is set in 1997 (They could have made it a bit more futuristic, I know. Maybe 2050?) And the infamous Island of Manhattan has been turned into one big maximum security prison. Every crook in America is sent to the Island and there's simply no escape. Air Force One is faced with problems and is crashed into the island, leading to the kidnapping of the President. Because of the situation, the prison officers are unable to get him as there are threats to kill him if any attempts to save him are made. The police commissioner known as Hauk has no option but to send in a former Special Operations soldier, who's now a convicted criminal in to save the president. Snake Plissken is made an offer. Save the president within 22 hours or die.<br /><br />For a movie made in the early 1980s, I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity of some of the visual effects. The border around the island was displayed with absolutely no flaws. Apart from the terrible 80s style haircuts, I would have been convinced that this movie was made in the past couple of years. The setting of a New York run by convicted criminals and psychopaths (better known as the Crazies) comes across as very genuine. At times I came to believe that something like this could come into effect, especially if the crime rates continue to rise. Kurt Russell is great in this movie, and being supported by the legendary Harry Dean Stanton was something great.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this to any movie fan. It's really better if you're not familiar with the style of Carpenter or the acting of Russell as you're given a real treat.perations soldier, who's now a convicted criminal in to save the president.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|I think that this was the best season of the three. It had action, scary creatures, and its first ever Christmas episode(one of my favorites)!<br />Dean has one year to live and he is trying to make the best of it by, \\"killing some evil SOB's and raising a little Hell.\\"<br />Jus en Bello was another one of my favorites with an unusual ally coming to the rescue. And we also find the brothers in some role reversals, with Sam doing more than thinking and Dean taking it slower. It was very interesting to watch. Can't wait for it to come out.<br />I did miss the classic rock, but thanks to the writer's strike they had to cut the budget and music was the first to go. But that won't stop me from watching it over and over again.
031606792X|2.0|I loved the first three books, but this one was an utter disappointment. The story is completely off the wall, and the writing style is terrible. (It's almost like it were written by a different author than the other books.) The descriptions of events in the book are graphic, gross, and far away from the romantic triumph the fandom was looking for. Even the final battle scenes were totally lame and unconvincing. It wasn't even worth reading. For best results, get the first three books in the series, then write your own ending - it's bound to be better than this.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|My first experience of a Hayao Miyazaki movie was Castle of Cagliostro way back in the early 80's. My second exposure to the same director ( not knowing it was also his work at the time) was the edited version of Nausicaa called Warriors of the Wind, the 1985 VHS release. I thought Warriors of the Wind was good, but much later when I did finally got a chance to experience the original Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind movie I changed my mind and viewed the cuts and edits to the original as some kind of crime.  The characters in the original Nausicaa of the Valley Wind movie are fully realized and very appealing in its full 1 hour and 57 minutes time frame. The story and drama of the film unfolds slowly and almost peacefully, but later the drama and action builds to an epic adventure and to a (jaw-dropping) climax. The structure and pacing of the movie, I thought at the time I view it (the mid 80's) was very rare for an animated film, and, I realized then, that it was not a film done for marketing toys and not done for dancing, singing, or funny kiddy cartoons. Instead, it was an animated feature with a serious straight-forward story about adventure, science fiction, fantasy, and also about human beings and their conflicts.  Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley Wind is not only a remarkable animated film for its time but also a timeless cinema classic for the ages.

6304493681|5.0|Ghost In The Shell' (released 1996 in the U.S.) by director Mamoru Oshii was a real butt-kicker for its time and brought renewed interest to Japanese Animation from North American film critics long after the landmark emergence of Akira (1988). The highly cerebral and detailed scriptwriting brought raves from some critics, while the sometimes altered translated English-dubbed version brought baffled reviews from others.<br /><br />While there are some great animated cinematic-styled action sequences, the film is still also an intellectual and philosophical mystery maze with characters struggling with the meaning of survival in a cybernetic world - themes that would years later influence and inspire the Wachowski brothers as they explored similar themes in 'the Matrix' trilogy.<br /><br />Along with possibly being one of the first original and sophisticated cyber-mystery thrillers, 'Ghost in the Shell' was also one of the first anime that appeared to integrate the old ink, cell, and paint methods into computer CGI digital graphics thoroughly and successfully to a seamless level of cinematic film mastery.<br /><br />(Back in the 80's, 'Akira' was still heavily using cell graphics and original BG paintings, while another early CGI anime in the 80's,'the Lensmen\\", still had computer technology in its underdeveloped early stages - the differences between CGI and Cell animation could be easily observed by the viewer.)<br /><br />Kanji Kawai's striking operatic music beautifully enriches and enhances the mood of 'Ghost in the Shell'. The music classically and digitally bridges the new with the old.<br /><br />Still, the qualitative uniqueness of the movie comes down to its detailed and highly complex science fiction screenplay, which is similar in sophistication and spirit to the ones that exists in films like 'Blade Runner' and '2001 A Space odyssey' (and also to some degree Pixar's new 'Wall-E'). These are the type of films that force the viewers to think at times while going along for the ride. (And it appears that films like these just don't come along very often.)<br /><br />But if that gets too boring for some viewers there's still always enough stylish but brutal butt-kicking by Motoko (Major) Kusanagi and Batou to keep any viewer tuned into the cyberpunk thriller right to the very end.<br /><br />***

My biggest complaint is that it shouldn't be for YA anymore with how much sex was in it. It wasn't in poor taste, it's just a lot more than a young teenager needs to be reading or thinking about. But I think it goes along with Meyer's other books well, it just closes up about every problem ever introduced in the story, it doesn't leave you wondering about anything.

Nice concert from the Greek Theatre with Chicago and Earth, Wind and Fire performing separately and together - contrasts the two styles and horn sections nicely.  Great sound and the HD video looks good - lots of camera angles, but some from unmanned cameras fixed to things like the drum kit that naturally move around some when the drummer is playing - fortunately they cut away from these shots often in the editing.

031606792X|1.0|I read the first three books and enjoyed them to varying degrees.  I was looking forward to the last one, Breaking Dawn, to see how the story line would end.    What I found was that the worst of the first three books, small segments that were all about Edwards 'ripling muscles' were most of the story in Breaking Dawn.  So much of the story was just bad writing.  The idea that Bella could get pregnant from someone made of stone is absurd.  Going with, what, a six week pregnancy was even worse.  Then having Bella drink blood because the 'baby' needed it was so bad that gave up reading the book.  I was told the rest by my daughters, who I now wish had not read the book.    There were so many bad or dumb things about the book that life is just too short to waste time reading it.  Pick up some other book and read it rather than waste time reading Breaking Dawn.  Poor plot, twists that simply made it so the author didn't have to think or work, but even worse it was demeaning to the readers.    Pass on this one.

031606792X|2.0|i read this book because i work in a bookstore. i read the previous ones and found that with each instalment it just kept getting worse, and as this series appears to be somewhat popular people ask me what i think of it... and i just don't feel comfortable speaking poorly something i know nothing about :P this said, after reading the third book i expected to give this a disgustingly low rating, but instead it just made me look at the series in a new light. i've written reviews on the other books so for my own sake i won't go into detail about what i think the series lacks, i'll just sum it up with saying that the author just isn't too good at what she does. the story of twilight is pretty standard when it comes to vampire romances, so the formula has been proven to work, but the author lacks the skill to develop characters and relies heavily on plot throughout the series, which can work, but she sets up the story in a character driven setting, so that doesn't really work. also, i feel as though a teenager is writing this. the logic, the manner in which the characters speak and the way in which the narrator presents the information... some reviewer somewhere said it reminded them of a fan fiction, which is a very appropriate label now that i think about it. so that also got under my skin a bit.<br /><br />taking these kinds of things into consideration, i relabelled this book in the series as a book you would find in the romance section of the book store, without the emotional catharsis of sex (then again it is very pg and the characters don't really show much desire for each other beyond saying how much they love each other... so words only). basically a soap opera for kids. and i suppose in my mind the first books were trying to be received as something more than that, which is why i think i was so disappointed. so ya, but not like the jane austen kind of romance, more the nora roberts or christine feehan, the ones where you roll your eyes constantly, but enjoy it because you know it isn't supposed to tickle your intellect in any way. that said, this isn't a negative category to fall under, but i don't think that's where this author would want these books to be.<br /><br />on to the book itself (yes i actually plan on talking about the book at some point during this long and pointless tirade). as i had the lowest possible expectations going into it, it wasn't that bad (thinking about it as a romance also helped). the characters seemed a bit two dimensional emotionally and there was quite a bit of filler that could have been left out as it didn't develop either plot or characters, but just kind of existed.<br /><br />teenage marriage and pregnancy were definitely taken very lightly and were almost promoted, but as i stopped taking it seriously by this point i wasn't very concerned about it. the author also promotes her morality more noticeably than in the other books, but this isn't really something to be concerned about i don't think. the issue with jacob and the baby seemed to be one of the things that turns people off a lot in this book, besides the fact that it was designed to be somewhat convenient for the plot and for modern morality, pedophilia and what not. i think the author just handled this awkwardly. she wanted jacob out of the way, but wanted everyone to have a disney ending, but wasn't too comfortable with the subject matter i don't think. (on a side note, a series that handled a romantic connection like what jacob and the baby had effectively is the black jewels trilogy by anne bishop. that one was decently done).<br /><br />so... if you read the series i would read this book as well, it won't be stellar, but it's better than what the last one left you with ... i wouldn't buy it though.you know it isn't supposed to tickle your intellect in any way. that said, this isn't a negative category to fall under, but i don't think that's where this author would want these books to be.     on to the book itself (yes i actually plan on talking about the book at some point during this long and pointless tirade). as i had the lowest possible expectations going into it, it wasn't that bad (thinking about it as a romance also helped). the characters seemed a bit two dimensional emotionally and there was quite a bit of filler that could have been left out as it didn't develop either plot or characters, but just kind of existed.     teenage marriage and pregnancy were definitely taken very lightly and were almost promoted, but as i stopped taking it seriously by this point i wasn't very concerned about it. the author also promotes her morality more noticeably than in the other books, but this isn't really something to be concerned about i don't think. the issue with jacob and the baby seemed to be one of the things that turns people off a lot in this book, besides the fact that it was designed to be somewhat convenient for the plot and for modern morality, pedophilia and what not. i think the author just handled this awkwardly. she wanted jacob out of the way, but wanted everyone to have a disney ending, but wasn't too comfortable with the subject matter i don't think.

031606792X|1.0|I wanted so much to love this book.  Twilight was one of my favorites.  I enjoyed New Moon and Eclipse almost as much.  But, Breaking Dawn was a complete and utter disappointment.    I've read other 1-star reviews and my gripe is a bit different.  The fact that everything is wrapped up in a tidy, happy ending, the idea that Bella sacrificed college for marriage and parenthood, or the strange twist that Jacob imprints on Bella's daughter didn't ruin the story for me.  What did?  It's so boring!  I devoured the first three books, but I've barely made it through this one.    Bella , Edward, and Jacob are completely flat.  The loss of sexual tension was a real blow, in my opinion.  And, don't even get me started on Bella's daughter's name.  Renesmee, really?      The introduction of vampires' gifts read like a cheesy superhero movie, and I read 700+ pages to get to a climax that wasn't even exciting.      In my opinion, this is just poor writing.  I was looking forward to Midnight Sun, but Edward has been ruined for me.  I wish that I'd taken the advice of another reviewer and not read this book.  Maybe then my love of Bella, Edward and Jacob would have remained intact.    I'm happy for those 4 and 5-star reviewers who loved Breaking Dawn.  I wish I could say the same!  I'm left looking for a palate cleanser... such a sad, unimaginative way to end what started out to be a fabulous series.
031606792X|3.0|I enjoyed the first three books in the Twilight series.  However, Breaking Dawn was a huge disappointment.  The book was at least twice as long as it needed to be.  Found myself speed reading/skimming the pages to try to find some small nugget of information to move the plot along.  It was almost as though a ghost writer had been brought in to tie up the loose ends and finish the series.
B00108DR1K|5.0|I seen this movie along time ago and Liked it so that is why I order it.
0452289963|5.0|Some reviewers have found this book to be a rehash of some long standing beliefs. In metaphysics there are Infinite ways to say the same thing. So in that context nothing is old nor is it new.        Eckhart is to me simply exploring the human dynamic/experience in ways that for the most part are often over looked and/or considered in this kind of detail.        I have a close friend who is very stressed by her job. I've been exploring with her that due to her ego investment in her work she has become defined by it. Such a definition almost always invites stress. What the book invites one to consider I felt is very appropriate to her situation so I am having it sent to her today.        Like all Masters some will hear his message and others will not. Thanks to his teachings about the Now and how most are still not present due to all their mind/ego chatter going on, to me he is contributing to what some call the collective Awakening or transitioning.        Spiritual teachers could easily be thought of as reminders. The help us get back in touch with what we already know.         Those that feel the need to judge something or someone are playing the game of making the myth of separation real. To them I would say EnLighten Up!
0143038419|5.0|After reading some of the reviews here I can't help but wonder: are we reviewing the book or the character?  Who cares why she got divorced? What does that have to do with anything? Some people just can't separate their personal opinions with the characters in a book.  I wasn't concerned with this woman's morality when I picked up the book. I just heard it was a good read and was interested in reading about this woman's journey.  Would I have done everything exactly as she did? Nope. Would I have experienced the same exact emotions? Nope. But that's why I read books, to get out of my own head. To experience other points of view. Her views are valid and her story is pretty good. I felt the book was entertaining and worth reading. But if you're one of those judgmental, holier than thou types, you better stand clear. There's way too much about this character for you to pick apart (one of the things I liked best about this story was that it had a ring of honesty through it).
0517543052|5.0|I was so happy to find this book online as it is very difficult to find in a bookstore.  Re-reading it, I found Be Here Now just as inspiring as the first time I came across this piece of spiritual literature.  A life-changing read!
B000093FLA|4.0|Very good movie and an interesting and engaging plot.  Very good acting.  But I had a devil of a time understanding anything anybody said--especially Brad Pitt.  Maybe that was the point, but I feel that unless I watch this movie about 5 more times, which I ain't gonna do, I didn't get as much out of it as I could.  Can't imagine how anyone from Mississippi or rural New England will be able to see this as anything but a foreign language film.
0618001905|5.0|I would like to present a review of Adam Hochschild's \\"King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa\\" which depicts the ruthlessness and greed of King Leopold in his exploitation of the Congolese.  Furthermore, it illustrates the horrors of the rubber trade which spanned nearly thirty years. The author narrates this account of African history particularly well.  Showing us the psychological traits of each character involved in the plot to acquire the Congo, the author gives us insight into the psychological motives of this episode in Belgium's colonizing days.  Leopold is an evil, political genius orchestrating a grand scheme to subtly take over the Congo.  He manipulates people with ease and lies just as easily. As Belgium's King, he acquires loyal spies in every major European country informing him of that country's intentions and political moves.   Furthermore, Hocschild chronicles how the Belgian army slaughtered the native Congolese in pursuit of rubber vines from the rain forest. Moreover, as a novel, \\"Leopold's Ghost\\" introduces each character individually tracing their roots from childhood and depicting their personality traits early in life and illustrates how personality traits shape people and their desires.
031606792X|1.0|I really enjoyed the first three books and eagerly awaited this last installment, but Breaking Dawn is so disconnected from the others in writing style, character and plot development, and overall story line that it was a waste of my time.  I agree with other reviewers who said the saga should have ended with Eclipse.  At some point readers should be able to use their own imaginations and not have the authorial dictator spoon feed every minute detail.  Readers should be active participants in a story, but in this book we are left out.  Besides, nothing happened.  It was boring and had little to no suspense.  The 750 pages it took to write this bizarre nonsense could have been summed up in one sentence: Bella and Edward get married, have a baby, and Bella becomes a vampire.  That's it.
B0019FOC5E|3.0|While the music is great and most of the overaged cast does a splendid job, the glaring submission by Pierce Brosnan leaves much to be desired. Couldn't Mel Gibson or Daniel Day Lewis have sung this role?
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is the only HP soundtrack I can listen to over and over again without getting sick of it.  It's got the familiar \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", plus the wickedly fun \\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\\" and the hold-on-to-your-hats \\"The Knight Bus\\" and \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\".  My favorite track, though, is probably \\"Mischief Managed\\", which incorporates nearly all the previous tracks in reverse order.  Love it!
B00030590I|4.0|Red version: Hero is the story of one man's quest (Nameless, played by Jet Li) to destroy the three assassins (lovers Broken Sword played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Flying Snow played by Maggie Cheung, and Sky played by Donnie Yen) who tried to kill the King of Qin (Chen Daoming).  Nameless bests Sky in combat, and Broken Sword and Flying Snow betray each other, all the while fighting off the King's entire army, until Nameless finally kills Snow. At least, that's the story Nameless tells the King, who is privileged with advancing within ten paces of him.<br /><br />Blue version: The King disagrees.  He knows the assassin lovers and doesn't believe the story. He instead believes that the three assassins sacrificed their own lives to allow Nameless the audience with the King, and thus a chance to commit regicide himself. He has developed a special move, the King theorizes, that can kill a man at ten paces.<br /><br />White version: Now the truth comes out.  Nameless explains who he is, where he came from, and why he is in the King's palace. Nameless has a technique that can skewer a person while missing all their vital organs, making the blow look fatal. He used it on Sky and he uses it again on Flying Snow. Surprisingly, Broken Sword is against the entire notion of assassinating the King at all, a decision that harkens back to the duo's first assassination attempt. It failed only because Broken Sword chose not to kill the King.<br /><br />Throughout the movie parallels are made between calligraphy and martial arts, and specifically the symbol for the word \\"sword.\\" There are deeper meanings within the brush strokes, a form of enlightenment that Broken Sword achieved and that the King discovers in his conversation with his would-be assassin. Nameless' decision and the effect it has on the other assassins provides the twist to the tale.<br /><br />Hero is a breathtaking movie, filled with balletic martial arts, lovely scenes in vivid colors, and natural settings reflecting China's ancient history and beauty.  It's entertaining and moving, and the relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow anchors the piece.  The three different tales, each depicted by a particular color scheme, provides different backdrops for heroics, drama, and warfare.<br /><br />On the other hand, Hero is a Chinese cinematic version of \\"[[ASIN:0399144463 Who Moved My Cheese]]\\" - it reinforces the status quo with a sinister charm.  Killing kings is foolish, says Hero, because it only leads to more war.  Nameless' decision is one of sacrifice, one for the many.  Were this only a fable, the story wouldn't be politically charged.  But the King of Qin went on to become the Emperor of China, who did a lot of great things.  So, you know, killing him would be bad because China wouldn't be nearly as great without him.<br /><br />The question becomes whether or not that matters on a greater moral scale.  Hero clearly makes the point that we should feel sympathy for the poor King in his enlightened state. Revenge never gets anyone anywhere. And yet by reducing the course of history to the assassination of one man, Hero makes many assumptions: about the importance of said man, about the progress of China, about our own human failings.  It's a very Chinese movie, which makes it either more authentic or less palatable to American audiences. It all depends on your definition of the term \\"hero.\\"d beauty.

B00168OINK|5.0|I was on a long flight back from California when I had the choice between watching Kung Fu Panda on a tiny television screen four feet away from me, or read the SkyMall catalog.  I wisely chose to watch Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />I was curious as to how Kung Fu Panda would present itself: as a Lion King-style retelling of ancient Chinese myth, or as a love note to kung fu films from an American perspective.  I'm pleased to report that it's the latter.<br /><br />You know the story: Po (a restrained Jack Black) adores the Furious Five but is too fat and slow to ever hope to become one of them and then fate does precisely that. It's the heroes who have the real problem (each representing a different kung fu style and all voiced by a roster of celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu). Struggling most of all is Master Shifu - a bit redundant, if you know the definition of Shifu - played by Dustin Hoffman (wouldja believe?) who is still suffering from the betrayal of his first and best pupil Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />What's surprising about Kung Fu Panda is how adult the story is.  The word \\"kill\\" is mentioned several times.  Tai Lung and Shifu have a physical conflict that is much a battle of philosophies as it is a father and son having an argument.  And the plot is beautiful in its symmetry, perfectly tying in every element: from the modified style of kung-food training that Shifu teaches Po to the revelation of Po's (we can only assume adopted) duck-father's secret recipe to the fact that Po is immune to acupuncture (because he's so fat, of course) Kung Fu Panda is tightly scripted and wrapped up in a beautiful package.<br /><br />The movie itself (what I could see on the tiny airplane screen) is beautifully produced.  It ranges from Chinese-style art to realistic but soft-colored tones, to bursts of color amidst pitch darkness.  The fight scenes are all in exciting locations: in a prison, on a rope bridge, in an ancient temple.  It's like a videogame, only you're watching the fat guy character nobody wants to play. It was beautiful enough that I had a pang of regret that I wasn't watching it on a big screen. Or even a medium screen.<br /><br />For kids, Po is a great tale about overcoming obstacles by being yourself.  For geeks, Po is a hilarious new hero archetype: the fanboy as hero, a fat, slobbering devotee who knows more details about the Furious Five than they know about themselves.atching the fat guy character nobody wants to play.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|This was one of the best series on tv in the 80,s and it was only on tv for two seasons.   I have been having a ball watching and reliving that period of the 60's that it relates too.   Best of the best as far as I am concerned.   I only wish that the quality of the series was prevalent in today's tv.   About the only thing to compare is, of course, Law and Order.   I would recommend this two season series to everyone.  Dennis Farina was superb.    I really love it.
031606792X|1.0|I'm not going to say anything here that hasn't already been mentioned in another one-star review.  This book seemed out of sync with the rest of the series and just became very bizarre.  The introduction of a baby was terrible, although convenient for the author as it helped her to tie up many of the story's loose ends.  Parts of the story were cotton-candy sweet and other parts were horror-story gruesome.  The climactic (or should I say anti-climactic) show-down with the Volturi was nonexistent.  It was supposed to be a mental battle (hence the chess pieces on the cover), but it really didn't play out that well.  If you were a fan of the first three books-just skip this.  The series should've ended with Eclipse.
0434370428|5.0|i remember 20 years back running to the book store to get this book and I read it real quickly. i enjoyed Michael Jackson talking about his career up to that point and also his take on music and in general. very interesting and a cool read on the King of Pop back in the day.
B001AJVR5M|2.0|i finally got to hear this album and with all the hype surrounding the Jonas Brothers who I view as a up-dated version of Hanson with the instrumentation,etc.. now I dug Lovebug and I thought burnin up was cool in a Maroon 5 kind of way. had they stuck with those two tracks as musical themes then they would have a really tight album. the rest of the album which has commerical appeal is basically pretty standard. they had about 5-6 tracks that didn't do much for me but when i heard a burnin up I gave them some dap. it will be interesting how they sound in the next few years once they get some more musical seasoning.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I commend HBO for this informative and highly educational production. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a more intellectually enriching experience from his or her TV than the vast superficial TV programming we now get. It is worth buying it and even watching it a second time with the historical fact feature. It is good for the whole family.
0316143472|5.0|I loved this book so much, I read it twice back to back. During the first reading, I took it with me to get my hair done. I was practically in tears and trying not to laugh out loud and looking like a total freak. If you like Sedaris, you'll like this book.
031606792X|5.0|These are great books.  I had the whole series read in no time because i couldn't put them down.
031606792X|5.0|So I'm very exasperated with the amount of people who are clearly not happy about the ending, because why they say?? \\"Everyone got what they want\\" \\"Meyer showed no sacrifice on behave of the characters for their happily ever-afters\\" now what is that about?? Why do people have to read a fantasy- for crying outloud- with a sad ending, why can't Bella have what she wanted from the beginning - love, happiness for eveyone? Why does Edward have to suffer in anyway, why couldn't Jacob find his fated love? Why, why,why? What's so bad about that?! Yes in reality people probably don't have happily-ever afters but why should they have to read about it in a book, where some people often go to escape their harsh realities? It's just unbelievable the amount of criticism Stephenie Meyer is receiving for writing an EXCEPTIONAL story, in which everyone has fallen in love with the characters who in the end get what they deserve. Even as young as I am I can tell that anyone who has written anything bad about this book, are wrong in their reasons! And \\"twilight moms\\" get over the fact that there are sexual innuendos in the story and the fact that (**Spoiler**) Bella has a child, at 18. Get over it. I'm under 18 and I'm not thinking of running out to have a child! That's just absurd! And I also guarantee your child has heard more explicit things about sex in school than in a novel.
B000WT7R6O|5.0|It was with SUPERNATURAL that I discovered the many varied virtues of Amazon Unbox - and I must say that it's a wondrous thing!<br /><br />I don't usually watch tv, per se. I do, however, love certain network & cable series. To be able to watch them, on my own schedule and at my own whim, right here upon my own computer screen, is just about the closest I've ever come to being spoiled in the whole of my existence!<br /><br />Now- for this show specifically: Let me just say that I don't think I've ever embraced so whole-heartedly such a guilty pleasure as offered by network tv before in all my history here on earth. In short, I just love this show!<br /><br />It's in essence the ongoing saga of a family - well, two brothers, specifically- Sam and Dean Winchester, whose mother was killed in 1983 in a fire over Sam's crib when he was six months old, by a supernatural entity. From that moment, Sam's father, John, has raised his children - Dean, who's four years older than Sam, and Sam himself- to hunt supernatural things, with the ultimate feat to kill the thing that murdered their mother.<br /><br />The allure of this show lies in the dynamics between the members of this fractured little family. Jared Padelecki and Jensen Ackles play Sam and Dean, respectively. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (\\"Grey's Anatomy\\") plays John.<br /><br />There have been recurring characters throughout the three seasons so far, Jim Beaver as Bobby the most notable of Season 3. The acting is simply excellent. There's quite a lot of mythology drawn into the flow of the storyline, though each episode is like an excellent mini horror movie in itself.<br /><br />The finale of this season left a major and most incredible cliffhanger. I am truly all agog for what happens next!<br /><br />Finally, if it weren't for Amazon Unbox, I would not have had the pleasure of viewing each of the episodes of this Season of SUPERNATURAL, as I work evenings and nights. I am most thankful it's been available!

0930289234|2.0|Not a masterpiece everyone makes out to be.  Although compare to other graphic novels, it's alittle bit better.  Bascially a murder mystery that along the way in solving it, goes into each of the character's backstory until mystery is solved in the end.  Ending somewhat disappointing and boring.
0195145925|1.0|I am always looking for a physics book that will enable me to evolve my perception of reality. This is not one of those books. Mr. Barbour makes an unconvincing attempt to convince the reader that a priori concepts such as causality and time are just an illusion. In the preface he states that he knows that most of the readers will not be able to finish the book, but if you read it to the end then all will be made clear. After suffering through the first 5 chapters, I skipped to the end and was convinced that he is wrong, and that time and causality are not an illusion.

0765342294|5.0|When you start the book you are immediately attracted to the main character.  He seems interesting,  and you want to know more about him.  Usually authors have a hard time maintaing that interest.  Orson Scott Kard is not only able to increase that interest, but keep you interested in every other character as well.  This book has great ideas in it.  I wanted to go into this book and do stuff like the characters.  I wouldn't last long,  and Orson Scott Kard makes that clear.  Only the best of the best survive,  and thats what makes this book intriguing.  The smartest and brightest of earth's children must grow and learn and take on impossible tasks.    This is undoubtly one of my favorite books of all time.  I've never read anything like it.  It pertains to almost every one of my interests.  I think Ender's game is special for everyone,  everyone likes something about it that makes it the best book they've ever read.      Delightful twists,  complex story telling,  and superb character devolpment make this book something you will always remeber.

B001C08RHA|3.0|I bought the SINGLE DISC EDITION, this is my 3rd purchase from amazon. The movie is amazing, waited 2 weeks and a couple of days but was worth it. The picture in the front cover is great, the back of the case is not as cool the 2 disc edition but its ok. Now, there is a small portion of plastic removed from the side of the case( not the one where you open the case), it looked like someone bit that portion of plastic off. Im going to buy the new INCREDIBLE HULK dvd, so please AMAZON, be more careful with my next dvd. Anyway, trailers of the new Hulk, deleted scenes, NEW startrek trailer, so single disc is great if you dont want to spend more cash for the extra disc. I dont think anyone appreciates if their dvds came in damaged cases. The front and the back pictures are safe. Just that portion on the side. EXCELLENT MOVIE.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I bought this for my husband because it is one of his favorite movies. He gives thumbs up on the flick and the special features. He was also impressed with the price because it was cheaper than he found it elsewhere.

0790729628|3.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was a senior in high school.  I thought it was pretty good at the time.<br /><br />Looks dated and weird now.  I didn't enjoy it.  Does not hold up well over time.  Not my favorite movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this.  Go find a good hobby like building bird houses or making beer.
B00151G08Y|5.0|I give this a 5/5 because its a great CD. Yes its different from HYC, and I LOVE HYC. But see the thing is, if it was just like HYC then it wouldnt be good they have to mix things up a little. Because if it was like HYC then people like us would be posting reviews saying \\"This is a cheap imitation of HYC nothing new.\\" Thats why this CD IS GREAT. its something different with a similar feel. ITS SO WORTH IT
B000002OX7|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  It is the one album in my collection that transcends the ages.  \\"Who's Next\\", can still reach me after more than 35 years of discovery.  \\"Baba O'Riley\\", \\"Bargain\\" and \\"The Song Is Over\\" speak to the inner spirit of a man, whether he is 18 or 50.  It continues to bring pleasure and it always will.
B00002DE2T|5.0|If you've heard that the first Exodus album, Bonded By Blood, is a thrash classic on the level of early Metallica and Slayer, it's true. With their first line-up Exodus made their best album. It's fast, it's evil, and it freaking rocks. If you like thrash/metal, Bonded By Blood is a must have CD.
0385340990|5.0|I inhaled this book!  I purchased it on a whim based on editorial reviews, though it isn't the type of fiction I usually purchase (leaning more towards mysteries and police procedurals).  I fell in love with the characters of this book and by the end, felt as though they were friends.  From  Juliet's sense of humor, Isola's blunt honesty about her looks, Eben and Amelia's dignity and wisdom, Dawsey's gentle steadfastness, Kit's good sense about people, and Elizabeth's bravery, I was touched to the heart.  If you are looking for a novel that truly captures the resilience of human nature (in oh so many ways), then don't wait.  Get this book now and set aside some time to read it.  If it touches you in the same way it did me, you won't want to put it down until you are finished but you'll regret it when you're done because you would like to know more.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|I've been a Motley Crue fan since Too Fast For Love in '83, really enjoyed Nikki's book, and now am a big fan of the Sixx AM CD as well. Sixx is a fantastic songwriter and highly underrated. This isn't like a Motley record or like the 58 band either; it's a personal, introspective, modern rock. There are some real rockers, some ballads, and some stuff in between, but it's all good. Only Nikki Sixx could make a concept album about himself and pull it off without sounding pretentious or full of BS.
0385338694|4.0|This is your typical chic lit. Great for a lazy summer day.  As a lawyer working in banking and finance just like the main characther, I'm very impressed by Kinsella's background check and how she captures the work in lawfirms. This book will not change your life but it will make you laugh.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|Storytelling at its best. Fincher does a wonderful job with this story, and I also loved the extras including documentaries, as well as David Fincher's commentary.
0143038419|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this book (esp. the Eat and Love parts), but the Pray third can drag on.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I just watched this version of P&P with low expectations, having viewed the definitive BBC version at least 20 times, and assuming this one would fall far short. I was right... although I admit I did enjoy watching it. Cinematically, it is quite beautiful - there is no dearth of luscious landscapes, interesting camera work, and gorgeous people. (The two leads are, perhaps, a bit TOO good looking...) It certainly looks better than anything the BBC could come up with. But in all other respects, it's so inferior as to make comparisons pointless. The story is rushed to the point that major characters and plot points are glossed over, crises unfold and are resolved much too hastily, and personalities are not well developed. Macfaydan, while undeniably GORGEOUS, is no Mr. Darcy. He comes across as quiet, reserved, just there. There is none of the arrogance, the disdain, the contempt that makes the character initially so unlikable, and therefore his big \\"transformation\\" doesn't really occur. Knightly is not bad, but her Elizabeth isn't really fleshed out much, either. Her relationship with her sisters, her father, Mr. Wickham, all of these are barely developed. And the two leads don't share enough screen time together to even make their romance believable.    This movie is purely for the casual viewer looking for a pretty, romantic period film. For lovers of Pride and Prejudice, the book or the miniseries, it's just another so-so version to add to the heap.
1594489505|5.0|I loved The Kite Runner and was so pleased that this story also was incredible.  I could not put this book down, it was captivating!
1563894696|4.0|The debate rages on between Batman fans as to who is the better Batman writer: Frank Miller or Jeph Loeb.  Miller tends to focus more on the psychology of the character, where Loeb focuses more on his skills as a troubled detective.  Loeb's first seminal Batman work, following a successful stint on the \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\" series, was \\"Batman: The Long Halloween,\\" published in 13 issues from late 1996 to late 1997.  \\"The Long Halloween\\" picks up after Miller's \\"[[ASIN:1401207529 Batman: Year One]].\\"  Someone is murdering prominent Gotham citizens on holidays.  At the end of each month, Batman races to discover the identity of the killer, nicknamed \\"Holiday,\\" and to stop him or her.  Aiding him is Lieutenant Jim Gordon and spunky District Attorney Harvey Dent.  Those familiar with the Batman mythos know where this is headed.    \\"The Long Halloween\\" was heavily influenced by film noir, as well as \\"[[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather]].\\"  The \\"Godfather\\" influence is clear in its depiction of the Falcone family, and its noir influences are clear throughout the story, especially in its depiction of Selina Kyle, who is given the femme fatale status she so deserves.  There's plenty of substance to go with that style.  Loeb can certainly craft a story.  \\"The Long Halloween\\" is a delightful mystery, shifting the focus from just how messed up Bruce Wayne to Batman's detective skills.  This is Batman as he was originally written.  We see Bruce Wayne, disturbed and haunted billionaire.  We see more of Batman, dark detective, prowling the tops of Gotham's skyscrapers, hiding in shadows, beating up thugs to know what he needs to know.  Surprisingly, Loeb even creates a killer whose identity will keep readers guessing until the end -- and maybe even after that.  To this day, the revelation still leaves people pondering.    Loeb's world is added dimension by Tim Sale's terrific artwork.  Sale is such a wonderful artist.  His work is some of the most distinctive and recognizable in the industry, alongside and yet vastly different from visionairies like Alex Ross or Frank Miller.  Sale's artwork can be beautiful, gothic, chilling, grand, or gritty.  It could even be all those things at once.  But while Sale really hits the noir depiction of Selina Kyle, the way he draws her makes her seem kind of trashy to me, for lack of a better word.  He did a much, much better job with her in the sequel, \\"[[ASIN:1563898683 Batman: Dark Victory]].\\"  In every other way, though, Sale's artwork is wonderful.    Also wonderful is Loeb's focus on the friendship between Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent, and Batman/Bruce Wayne.  He emphasizes the tragic angle of their friendship and the result, especially its result on Bruce Wayne.  Loeb's depiction of their friendship may have influenced Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  Screenwriter David S. Goyer has said that \\"The Long Halloween\\" was one of the three chief influences for \\"[[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]].\\"  Additionally, IGN Comics named \\"The Long Halloween\\" the fifth greatest Batman story in the history of the character.  It was the only Batman story of the last 15 years to crack the top five.    For making a sixty-year-old character seem completely fresh and new, for crafting a very original and very engrossing mystery, and for making one of the best comics in recent years, Sale and Loeb deserve a lot of credit.  \\"Batman: The Long Halloween\\" is one of the finest Batman stories, and a must-read for fans or casual readers looking to become acquainted even loosely with the world of comics.
B0012Q732O|3.0|WANT A PREHISTORIC LOVE STORY WITH SOME INTERESTING VISUALS ?  WELL  THIS WILL GET YOU THERE. ALTHOUGH NOT A GREAT MOVIE, IT DEFINITELY HAS SOME CHARM. WORTH A WATCH AT LEAST.    WE'VE HAD \\"1,000,000 BC\\" (MID-1960'S) AND NOW \\"10,000 BC\\". MAYBE \\"100,000 BC\\" WILL BE A HIT AND NOT STRIKE 3.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|There's little new in director Ridley Scott's \\"American Gangster.\\" However, the emphasis on characterization over violent action is refreshing. Denzel Washington gives a compelling performance as real-life Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, with Russell Crowe equally impressive as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts - the man determined to bring down Lucas' heroin empire. An excellent supporting cast features standout portrayals by Josh Brolin and Oscar-nominated Ruby Dee. Regardless of the predictable outcome, Scott manages to keep the pot boiling for 157 minutes. \\"American Gangster\\" does not rank with the classic crime epics, but remains a solid achievement.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I loved this film...it was sweet and sexy... but not so much that I couldn't watch it with my own gay son! The storyline with the sister and her child was sad because there are so many kids who have parents that just want to pawn them off so they can go play...but the ending had me happy and teary-eyed! If you are looking for hot sex or a stereotypical \\"gay\\" film with clubs and drugs...this is not the film for you. It is a satisfying love story/family drama that leaves you wanting more!
0385340990|5.0|It's been a slow reading year for me--nearly every book I've picked up, however good, has not really held my attention and has taken weeks to finish.  Racing through _Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society_ in one day was therefore particularly thrilling:  a fun story, a *funny* story, with engaging characters and fabulous narrative voices!  Just the thing I needed!  More than that, it had substance behind Juliet's sass and sparkle: the fictional retelling of a very real event that was, itself, not funny at all.<br /><br />If you don't know about the German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II, this book won't teach you all that much.  It's better for whetting the appetite for knowledge and bringing to attention a part of the war with which the reader may not be familiar.  By mixing the inevitable heartstring-pulls with banter, the authors prevent it from becoming too much; it wouldn't have been hard for the story to turn cheesy with sentiment.  In truth, I don't think it *entirely* skirts that issue, but at least it comes close.<br /><br />The minor marring for me came in characterization, even though that's one of the authors' definite strong points.  Many characters are compelling.  Juliet writes with flair and charm, Isola's eccentricities amused me, while I felt a pang for Eben's losses and could easily imagine Amelia in all her dignity.  Elizabeth, however, was both too good to be true and too omnipresent (although there's a plottish reason for that), and Dawsey just bored me.  That's unfortunate since these two are more important to the storyline than anyone save Juliet herself.  Due I suspect to the epistolary format, there's also a lot of white space in the book--and it wasn't thick to begin with, so overall it feels a little slight.<br /><br />Of course, I'm still giving it five stars, because it was by far one of the most entertaining things I've read this year.  Go ahead and try it!  It's got history and humor, and it's a great way to spend a lazy afternoon.y to spend a lazy afternoon.
0790729350|5.0|Something happened in the '60s, and we're still feeling the effects of it now.  Even as I type these words, my neighbors on the other side of the apartment wall are playing rock music REALLY LOUD -- I even like what they're playing, though I'm not sure what band's album it is.  For better or worse, rock music and its attendant baggage have had an enormous effect on our culture: I would even go so far to say that a certain energy has been raised, and continues to be raised, by this sort of music.    Popular music began to change in the mid-1950s, as black rhythm-and-blues was sanitized for the white audience, or should I say that audience's parents.  To make a long story short, popular music (according to a rock history documentary I saw some years ago) had been taken over by the bohemian element by 1969.  From that time until sometime in the '90s, a large percentage of popular music actually had artistic merit: an anomalous situation in the history of the recording industry.    That reality is reflected by the Woodstock music festival of 1969, which the DVD being reviewed here documents.  This DVD seems to be somewhat longer than the theatrical release was, with a few more acts shown.  The only group that seems really out-of-place here is the novelty act Sha Na Na, who did a sendup of '50s rock.  The rest of it is at least very good, with some of it being superb.  Some of it left me with my jaw hanging open, even after all these years.  The echoes of this energy still in some part animate us...    One thing about this that younger people might think about is that this was all new at the time: only 14 years before Woodstock, the number 1 hit for 1955 was Patti Page's \\"How Much is That Doggie in the Window.\\"  The WWII generation mostly hated our music; the width of that generational gap, perhaps the widest such gap in history, is shown by the difference between our music, and their music.  I still can't stand watching Lawrence Welk...    Along with the music, there are short clips of life at the rock festival,  including some interview footage.  This footage nicely frames the music, and gives, I think, some sense of the spirit of the time.    I do have a small connection to this: in 1971 or '72, I met a guy at a party who told me that he was in the Woodstock movie -- he was one of the people who came over the fence at about the time they turned it into a free concert.  I went and watched the movie again the next time it came around, and sure enough he wasn't lying.    My previous review to this was of the film _Groupies_, which I characterized as illustrating more of the everyday reality of those days.  This film provides the contrast to that, as it gives us a glimpse of the counterculture's peak moment.  After that, it was all downhill; by the late '70s we had gone from \\"peace and love\\" to \\"disco sucks!\\"  There was still a lot of good music to come, but that was truly our grand ball. I'm confident we won't see the likes of this again, nor will our descendants for some generations to come.    I give this one five stars: not only is the music terrific, but the film is superb as a documentary that gives a good impression of \\"how it was\\" to those not old enough to remember the time.

B00007GZR5|5.0|I have always loved this movie, not just for the story, but also for the artistic value as well.  I have never seen any movie that has such beautiful colors and creative artistry.  Anyway, the seller shipped this to me almost as soon as I ordered it.  I believe I got it two days after I ordered!  It plays beautifully with no scratches or smudges on the DVD.

6300184064|5.0|This is a masterpiece of a movie, one that a director can only accomplish once in a lifetime, and has to be watched without distraction. For young viewers who got used to today's nausea inducing camera shots and ultra quick half second edits, the pacing could come off as ponderous at first. One one level, it's a beautiful and even by today's computerized standards awesome cinematic masterpiece, one that's done without any 3D graphics at all, and even trying to imagine some of the scenes being constructed without the help of any computer graphics is simply staggering. On the other, it's a razor edged satire targeted at bureocracy and pettiness in our society. It's so obvious that this movie has been lovingly put together bit by bit with incredible attention to detail by whomever took part in it, from the costume designers to background painters, and only a director like Terry Gilliam could bring it all together without going insane with all that detail. Music is top notch, too.
031606792X|4.0|Although I liked the 3rd book better, I liked the creativity in which Stephenie wrapped up the 4th book. Writing is a tough business. You can't make everyone happy, but you can end it in an interesting way. This one was tough because a) she couldn't snuff out Bella's life without giving her the experience of humanity ( children, sex, love). b) She had to work in the love story so that it stayed true to character..her love was Edward and she can't be with him without being a vampire.   She found a great way of appeasing her writer side and to pay respects to the world view Ms. Meyer has. This is the writers perogative. If you were disappointed, that's a shame because it wasn't that bad. Try reading a Sidney Sheldon book...those are always wrapped up into a nice neat little package....IT's FICTION! FICTION! What Disney film or High School Musical type movie doesn't end up with a twist that fixes everything. Change your perspective or NOTHING will be enjoyable for you.  I will say that I really could only give it 3 1/2 stars, but it was darn entertaining, bubble-gum for the mind type of reading. Escapism at it's best. The writing is okay, the verbage is a bit aged (nudger) but overall the story made me happy, and what else did you want?  You can't make everyone happy, so hopefully Stephenie Meyer liked the final product.
B0017XFBMG|2.0|Glad I bought this cause I love the band.   Having said that, there's only about a half dozen tracks I'll ever listen to again.   If nothing else this box set proves that their best stuff is on record already.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Bruce Willis is at it again in the fourth entry of the \\"Die Hard\\" movies.  To be brief. Some things are done excellently,,,such as dialog and of course the stunts. But as with anything when trying to up the ante for the fourth time some things are not up to excellence. Some of the characters and some of the situations are blah blah.   Bottom line...a good movie to own, and see over again.
0446402389|3.0|Inspired by the real-life crimes of the infamous Russian serial killer dubbed the \\"Butcher of Rostov,\\" first-time novelist Tom Rob Smith has crafted a taut, compulsively readable thriller with a propulsive narrative that more than makes up for the novel's occasional stylistic and technical shortcomings. In Stalinist Russia, MGB officer Leo Demidov risks everything -- cushy job, beautiful wife, family and life -- to track down the culprit behind a gruesome series of explicitly detailed murders. It turns out that Demidov's biggest enemy is the Soviet system itself and Smith does a thorough job of creating a world where \\"paranoia was an essential asset.\\" The Kafka-esque absurdities pile up; one of the most delicious is that Demidov's superiors refuse to even acknowledge that a crime has been committed. To be sure, some of the twists and revelations that follow are clumsy or abrupt and Smith has a habit of presenting everything in as sensationalistic a manner as possible without bothering to follow through on the emotional implications for his characters. Nonetheless, this is a top-rate thriller that is ultimately and unexpectedly a touching story about, in the words of one character, putting \\"trust in the goodness of strangers\\" in a time and place where everyone is compromised.
1594489505|4.0|I decided to purchase this book after a friend lent me The Kite Runner.  I like the author's style of writing and it's a good story. I like how he conveys the history and the plight of the people living in Afghanistan by weaving facts into fiction.  Most Americans (like me) don't have a clue about what goes on over there.  They are real people, just like us, with families, pets, relationships, and educational/career goals who are blown to bits during war after war thrust upon them by others.
0790731924|5.0|I have all of the Lethal Weapon movies & they're all great! Action packed movies that will make you laugh,make you cry & keep you on the edge of your seat. Mel Gibson & Danny Glover are both great actors that work magnificently together & seem to have a great working relationship. I don't think that a better duo could've been chosen for this series of movies! They go together like peanut butter & jelly. I'm so glad that these two played in all the movie sequals. It just wouldn't have had the same effect if Gibson & Glover hadn't returned to their roles that they made their own in all the Lethal Weapon movies. These two are definately irreplacable! I highly recommend these movies to anyone & everyone who wants to enjoy a great movie experience. The Lethal Weapon movies are classics in my book.I never get tired of watching them! Where most movie sequals aren't as good as the origional, you won't find that with these movies - they're all great!
B001AJVR5M|4.0|Ok, so I am a die-hard \\"JoBro\\" fan, and i do have to say that this is their best album yet. Here is a play-by-play review for all you people who are unsure about buying this album:        BB Good- 5/5. This is one of my favorite songs on this album. Classic girlfriend/boyfriend type song. Some pretty hot screams in there from Joe, too ;). Up-beat vocals, which totally makes you want to sing along        Burnin' Up- 4/5. This is their first single, and they did a pretty good job with it, but it can get a little annoying after a while, because the chorus is repeated a million times.        Shelf- 4/5. I like this song. Kinda makes you never want to do anything mean to your boyfriend/girlfriend. Ever.        One Man Show- 5/5. This song is very...triumphant...for lack of a better word. Shows that they don't need girls to make them happy.         Lovebug- 5/5. This is the best song on the CD! Starts off totally mellow and reggae, then kicks up a little beat. This song is so cute...!        Tonight- 5/5. Great harmony and falsetto in this song. Shows the Jonas Brothers' amazing harmonizing skills.        Can't Have You- 3/5. Just OK. Kind of boring and typical.       Video Girl- 4/5. This song is really upbeat and frowns upon these girls that would want to date a Jonas Brother just because they're a Jonas Brother.       Pushin' Me Away- 4/5. Another great harmony song. Besides that it's just OK.       Sorry- 5/5. A totally sincere apology-type-song. Will make your heart melt!       Got Me Going Crazy- 3/5. Eh. It's just ok. Good dancing song, but that's really all what's great about it...      A Little Bit Longer- 5/5. This will seriously make you cry. It's about Nick's diabetes and how they all get through it together. Amazing.            Hope this helped!!!!            =D ~Noelle~
031606792X|1.0|I'm an English teacher and so, I admit, I tend to be a little more critical of style, grammar and usage, but surely any avid reader will note the many flaws in Meyer's latest installment.  This book is so badly written it is difficult to get through.  (Indeed, I found myself groaning aloud while reading particularly sappy descriptions or badly constructed sentences.)  Meyer's first three books were poorly written in places as well, but at least the characters were compelling and the overall storytelling satisfying.  However, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is sadly disappointing because one suspects that Meyer didn't take care with her language or her subject matter.  Unlike some readers, I never thought Meyer compared to Rowling [[ASIN:0439554934 (Harry Potter)]], but now I'm more convinced then ever that she ought to take a few good writing classes at her nearest university.  She clearly has many creative ideas, but she needs to learn how to effectively bring those ideas to life.<br /><br />For example, I agree with many of the critics here that \\"Breaking Dawn's\\" happy ending is a disappointment because Bella does nothing to earn it.  There is nothing heroic about her since she gets all she desires with virtually no sacrifice or work on her part.  She doesn't even have to struggle with her blood lust very much when she's a newborn vampire, or give up her relationship with her human father.  Of course, some will say that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is just \\"fiction,\\" but the best fiction (even fantasy and sci-fi) mimics  the emotional struggles in life and is thus full of sacrifice and tough choices.  Even many fairy tales like the original Little Mermaid abide by this principle as is seen when the Little Mermaid trades in her scales for legs that \\"cut like knives every time she walks.\\"  Disney [[ASIN:B000F8O35U (The Little Mermaid)]], of course, radically changed this story, insisting on a happy ending that Hans Christian Anderson [[ASIN:8714273926 (The Little Mermaid)]] never included and, in my opinion, radically diminishing the power of the original story, but that's neither here nor there.  All I'm saying is that Bella badly needs to gain wisdom and maturity and she cannot do either by magically \\"getting it all,\\" including an improbable hybrid baby and a storybook cottage in the woods.<br /><br />Oh, and imprinting on infants?  That's just gross. Leah is Jake's equal and in her feisty, yet vulnerable way she is a much better potential girlfriend.  The truth is, losing your first love is hard and there is no easy way out of that.  Jake needed to reconcile himself to losing Bella, not take a magic pill, so to speak.  Sure, this series may be, as some have called it, a kind of modern fairy tale, but, as I have already pointed out, even fairy tales acknowledge the loss and pain one must endure in order to find the right companion.  I also dislike the fact that Jake imprints despite his great longing to choose his life partner.  His deep concern about losing his freewill is one of the most appealing aspects of his character and when he imprints on his first great love's hybrid offspring it is disturbing in more ways then one.<br /><br />Even worse, I was really excited right at the end because I thought we'd finally get an intense, bloody, no-holds-barred battle with casualties on both sides, but instead we got nothing but a bunch of tense moments and endless talking.  In fact, I wonder if Meyer can even write an action packed scene with multiple characters.  Think of the excitement of Rowling's final epic battle [[ASIN:0545010225 (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows)]] and you realize immediately what Meyer is missing.  The talented \\"witnesses\\" such as Benjamin do very little for all they were built up by Meyer.  Bella's immense shield was impressive, but it didn't allow for any interaction between both sides and thus the scope of her power was poorly chosen.  (Side note: I was really hoping Bella would have an active power rather than a passive one.As a human teenager she relied on the guys in her life to rescue her far too much and had no real identity or strength of her own.  It would have been refreshing to watch her return the favor and save those she loves in an active way, a way that put her own life at risk, a way that forced her to make a difficult choice.)  Even if she had to be a \\"shield\\" for others she should have been able to shield only one other person at a time in order to allow the other vampires the chance for a knock-down fight.  Wouldn't it have been something to watch her have to choose between shielding Jake and Edward's lives, for example?  Now that would be dramatic.<br /><br />As if all of that weren't enough, we never leave Forks except for the Isle of Ismene, which could be anywhere.  Was Meyer too lazy to research other places?  Why not take us to the rainforest, or at least follow some of the other members of the Cullen family as they round up other \\"witnesses\\"?  Oh, and why was J Jenks so necessary?  And why did we get so much detail on all the other vampires if knowing what they were capable of was not essential to the final encounter with the Volturi? There are so many internal inconsistencies, loose ends and odd details that go absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was Meyer's use of point of view (POV). Why the strange insertion of Jake's POV into the middle of the story?  To be fair, Jake's humorous POV is somewhat of a relief, but it is inconsistent with the previous books.  If Meyer wanted to open up the possibilities of first person narration, wouldn't it make more sense to include other points of view, too, such as Edward's and some of the other members of the Cullen family?  What was Meyer's reasoning for suddenly plunging us into Jake's inner world, only to yank us back again and thrust us back into Bella's?<br /><br />Finally, Meyer's foreshadowing is less then subtle.  I guessed nearly every so-called \\"twist\\" well ahead of time, which effectively killed the suspense for me.  For example, did anyone ever believe Alice wasn't off doing exactly what she was doing?  How could Edward and Bella think she had abandoned them for even a moment?  Also, having two earlier minor characters (Quil and Clare) do the same exact thing as two later main characters (Jake and Nessie) is not foreshadowing.  Meyer is both obvious and, at times, wildly inconsistent when it comes to crafting plot and she needs to take a page out of Rowling's book if she wishes to learn the true art of foreshadowing and misdirection.<br /><br />In short, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" has just enough potential to be truly disappointing. Perhaps she took on too much for a new writer and she shouldn't have tried to write \\"The Host\\" and \\"Breaking Dawn\\" at nearly the same time.  Whatever the reason, one feels the loss with each chapter, how much the book is over-written, how much it needed a truly brutal and gifted editor.  With its glaring errors and numerous inconsistencies this book reads like a rough draft, not a polished final draft.  It was all I could do not to get out my red pen.<br /><br />P.S.  Am I the only one who, after reading this series, began to miss Buffy and Angel?  Now that was a forbidden love story between a human and a vampire! See [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set]], especially the first three seasons.

031606792X|3.0|I too was disappointed with Breaking Dawn. It was not nearly as good as her other books. I even felt like skipping over some of the pages as she just rambles on and on about witnesses-who really cares. It was a disappointment to end her series this way.
0345495004|5.0|This novel touches on the currents and issues facing America in the early 20th century A growing middle class, having left the farm for the city and suburb, is commissioning custom designed homes.<br /><br />One theme is the role and situation of women.  Teachers, librarians and other female workers are paid near poverty wages.  Well off suburban women, like Mamah Cheney drive cars (albeit hand cranked) are free of domestic drudge (through low paid domestic help) and join clubs and form literary groups. What else do they do all day?<br /><br />The times are well depicted, complete with the Bohemian cafes of Germany and the stateside canvassing for woman's sufferage. At the end Mamah worries about her European friends in the wake of the Archduke's assassination.<br /><br />Nancy Horan brings to life a woman who left her comfortable home and  marriage for the man who later becomes iconic.  It is an operatic story, and a quick internet search shows that there is an opera, The Shining Brow, based on it.<br /><br />The character of Mamah is lovingly drawn.  This character is hard to reconcile with the woman who did not just leave her children, she took them to Colorado and cabled her husband to pick them up so that she could meet FLW in Germany. Once she did this, the Rubicon had been crossed.  While the patient Edwin would take her back, how would this really work?  What of her sister who had given so much for her and suffered public humiliation for Mamah's actions?  Once Mamah leaves, there really is no going back.<br /><br />Horan's portrait of Wright, while sympathetic includes his flaws.  In Horan's interpretation, Wright is unable to tell Mamah, who left everything behind for him, neither his true financial status, nor his actual relations or communications with his wife and 6 children.  These things seep into her consciousness when it is too late to turn back the clock.<br /><br />The book sets the stage for what followed in Wright's life.  Wright is not a young man and it's like starting all over. For those interested in the next stage of his life I highly recommend the non-fiction book [[ASIN:0060988665 Fellowship, The: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship]].<br /><br />Horan is to be saluted not only for this work of fiction, but for the research.  She has brought together a lot of important material, and while this is a work of fiction, it adds perspective on FLW and his legacy.interested in the next stage of his life I highly recommend the non-fiction book [[ASIN:0060988665 Fellowship, The: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship]].

B0014I4KIK|4.0|A great debut CD from an immensely talented new singer.  The title song and Warwick Ave in particular are fantastic songs.  The album is not universally great and I think the singer is still figuring out how to best harnass her talent, but the highlights certainly make this album worth buying alone.  This is definitely someone to watch in the coming years.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|once again, the movie writer has taken this wonderful old story, honed for years by telling, then written down in beautiful poetry, and changed it. what arrogance! beowulf kills grendel. he then uses a sword from grendel's mother hoard to kill her. he later becomes king of his own country, the geats. he kills a dragon with the help of a young wiglof, but dies of his wounds and is cremated and buried in a barrow with the cursed dragon's gold. a super story, much beloved. so why do we have grendel's mother surviving? why add in sex and half demon children with hrothgar and beowulf? why make him king of the danes? i enjoyed this movie, i have to admit. the animation and language and music were stunning. oh, but if only they had stuck to the real story.
1593082649|4.0|I am making my way through all of Austen's book, and this  was the third after Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.  This was the first of her novels and the last one to be published.  However, her writing is most of the time almost as sharp as in  the later novels, and the plot will also not be too much of a  surprise.  The novel is, however, not at the level of the previusly  mentioned two, perhaps mainly because the heroine is somewhat  dim, although likeable.  The conversations between Mr. Darcy  and Mrs. Bennet are those of equals.  However, it is sometimes   painfully obvious in the exchanges between Henry and Katherine  that it is Henry who is the intelectually superior.   Although the   plot rambles a bit here and there, this is still a very good read,  and Austen's wit shines through on a number of occasions.
1400064287|5.0|Chip and Dan Heath have written a priceless book, full of wisdom and great stories about what makes for effective teaching and leadership. It's not the razzle-dazzle of our teaching that makes a difference, they say, but whether we incorporate six key characteristics. I've been in the education business for almost 40 years and I learned a LOT from this book. Highly recommended!
B00005JLPK|4.0|This film is outstanding in so many ways: First, the musical score is a tremendously exciting! Second, the sets, the photography and use of color are artistic achievements on thir own. Third, the integration and melding of Kahlo's art work into a film is brilliant. Fourth, the acting, especially by Selma Hyak. is excellent and she really channels Frida. My only reservation about the film is that it should have been done in Spanish, with sub-titles  which would have been no problem for Selma.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Well the question of whether this album was going to be better than Curtis was answered a long time ago, so I think enough time has passed to look back on it and assess it as it is; Kanye West's third studio album.  To start off, the artwork is one of the best I've ever seen on a hip hop album, and it'll catch your eye every time.  As far as the music goes, I think it could have been much better had the original version of \\"Homecoming\\" been used.  I still don't quite understand Chris Martin singing the chorus of a love song about Chicago, but who am I to question the marketing machine that is Mr. West.  I think \\"Home\\" with John Legend is a far better song and was disappointed not to see it here.  And speaking of that, where is \\"Bittersweet\\" with John Mayer???  Some of Kanye's best lyrics ever and in my opinion a far better song than \\"Big Brother\\" which should have been a b-side or a bonus track somewhere, as I believe \\"Bittersweet\\" became.  Other than that, you know most of these songs already b/c he's released about 5 or 6 singles from this record.  If you like those pick it up, if you're just starting out I'd suggest starting with College Dropout and than Late Registration (my personal favorite West album).  3 1/2 stars.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|**** (Amazon locked my accidental 5 star rating).    I feel the need when discussing a band like the Offspring to state my age.  There seems to be two kinds of fans who remain standing today; those who were old enough to know Smash and Ixnay (and possibly Ignition) when they were actually released, and those who were young and enjoyed the novelty of \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy\\".  I have to say that Americana was the last album that was universally loved by both groups of these fans.  As a 26 year old, I fit into the first.  Which is why I listened through \\"Conspiracy\\" once and only know that \\"Hit That\\" was a lame song on an album called \\"Splinter\\".  The Offspring had been one of my favorite bands in the world, but that was 10 years ago.  So it was with some reluctance that I downloaded \\"Rise & Fall, Rage & Grace\\" a couple of months ago. I have to say, that I was immediately hooked, just like the old days.  \\"Half-Truism\\" has become one of my favorite Offspring songs ever, and \\"Trust in You\\" could have very well been on \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\".  \\"You're Gonna Go Far Kid\\" is pretty annoying to me and should not have been a single in my opinion, but \\"Hammerhead\\" works really well.  The next couple of songs are strong, and then comes \\"Kristy Are You Doing Okay?\\", which initially had me rolling my eyes. Then I just skipped it. Then I let it play.  Then I put in on while not listening to the album and now it makes my mix cd's and play lists.  I don't know how, but it truly grew on me and is one of my favorite songs. As for the rest of the album, it rocks.  I think either one of these groups of fans that I described would love this record and I'm glad I gave it a chance.  You should too.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|My favorite film experience since ONCE WERE WARRIORS. coincidence? you bet.

Also, the actor dude is a spittin image of my good buddy's son, from the hair and complexion down to the  playful \\"wide eyed\\" expression. great stuff

B00003CXCD|4.0|Roman Holiday -     Audrey Hepburn, a young stressed princess, experiences life without schedules and guards when she sneaks outside her country´s embassy in Rome after being given sleeping medication. Gregory Peck, a poor newspaper reporter trying to earn enough money to get back to NY, thinks she is drunk and doesn´t want her to be picked up by the police.      Thereafter follow several comedic scenes. He follows her around to get a real inside scoop on the life of a princess... His friend (Eddie Albert)brings a hidden camera.  They tour several famous places in Rome, ending up back where she started in the shadow of the embassy on a boat and suddenly surrounded by several secret service agents from her own country. They end up falling in love and hence the interesting ending when she discovers who he really is.        The extra material, some told by Eddie Albert´s son, tells you interesting side lights as to what part each of the actors put into making the movie unique. I had already seen the movie when I purchased this... It is a classic Audrey Hepburn film.
031606792X|5.0|i really liked this final book of the series. i was really worried while i waited for it to get here because i read some of the reviews that weren't so favorable. when i finally got it, i read it cover to cover in a day and i loved it because i got to put it down with a warm and fuzzy feeling. much better than when harry potter ended. that was seriously depressing. i really liked the ending, when she let edward hear her mind. it was so sweet it made me cry a little.     i really hate it when people try to make things more than they are. this book is a work of fiction, and one that is very unlikely at that. while i was reading it i didn't think of all the feministic issues about going to college and all that. i actually let myself enjoy it. imagine that, i read a book to enjoy it, not to tear it apart. i read it to escape reality, to go into bellas life of danger and love, not to inject reality where there isn't any. i think dependent women with self esteem issues like bella are sometimes fun to read about because i get tired of reading about the same kinds of characters, and honestly, strong women characters are becoming commonplace nowadays. a lot of the books i read have a loud, hard headed and kind of bitchy heroines and it gets annoying sometimes. im not a particularly strong individual myself and i can relate more with bella. not that women should be wimpy. its kinda fun to watch my mom yell at people. like at the dmv and the eye doctor.    i really see nothing wrong with bella having a kid. she was a little young but i don't think that will leave the impression that its a good idea to teen girls. thats like what they are saying about the movie juno, which, being the 17-year-old girl that i am, did not leave me with the idea that i want to go out and start making babies. same with breaking dawn. and plus, staying home with the kids isn't so freaking terrible. if my siblings and i were left to be raised by our father, our lives would be one big train wreck. my mom has spent her whole life raising kids and she wouldn't ever take any of it back. it takes all kinds of people to make the world go around. not all women should or want to be career women and i think that people should stop pressing the issue. plus, bella has her whole immortal life to go to college, one more big, giant reminder that this is FICTION. bella loves edward and vice versa and i think that it is wonderful that everything worked out happily. jacob imprinting on renesmee (i honestly think it should have been carly renesmee, not the other way around) was just perfect because it explained his obsession with bella. i really liked jacob and it made me sad that he was so sad.    i think that the people that hated it need to calm down. stress is bad for the health, you know.

B0017MO10U|5.0|Like another reviewer said, I needed a Stargate fix.  Although Stargate:Continuum was another take on someone messing with the timeline,(see the Stargate episode 'Moebius') this movie is fun to watch.  It was too short for my taste so I'm hoping there's another movie planned in the future.  We learn some background history about the Stargate when Baal goes back in time to alter the timeline so he can defeat the other Goa'uld system lords and later conquer Earth.  The movie does a nice job working in (although briefly) many of the characters from over the years.  O'Neill makes a brief appearance (yay) and Mitchell gets to be a hero.  There are some good extras on the disc as well such as the experience the filmmakers and actors had filming the movie in the Arctic.
031606792X|5.0|Despite the lashing out on Stephenie Meyer that thousands of so - called fans are partaking in, I loved this book. I refrained from visiting any sites and reading any reviews for three days so I could read in peace and let the full momentum of the story's suprises sink in.     I am so happy with this final installment. All of the loose ends are tied, all except for Leah's happy ending, which I believe SM left open for good reason. I think she will continue with Leah's story. This book is meant for Edward and Bella, therefore their ending is the main reason the book exists.     This book gave me hope that maybe a sacrifice is not always mandatory. Maybe things can really fall into harmony with fate in time.     I cannot grasp the backlash circulating around this book. Truly, Stephenie knows how she wants her stories to end, and she does it gracefully, even with the horror of Bella's birth/death/transition chapter. I was engrossed in these chapters, as this is what all fans were anticipating in the first three books.       I LOVED it!

031606792X|1.0|Twilight is a guilty pleasure for me, but I used to tell anyone who'd listen how much fun they were to read anyway. This final installment alternately infuriated me or bored me so much I had a hard time finishing it.<br /><br />First off, there are about a dozen \\"WTF\\" moments in the novel  - which is a lot, even though this tome is a mammoth 754 pages.  Jacob imprints on Nessie (don't even get me started on the baby name)? Bella and Nessie being the most perfectly amazing wonderful surprising beautiful charming vampires EVAH? Bella is okay with getting unintentionally beat up by Edward during sex? Flimsy black lingerie? \\"Jazz\\" and \\"Em\\"? Seriously? So many have said Breaking Dawn reads like fan fiction, and I agree. The characters don't seem the same, the plot twists and jumps in ways both completely predictable yet still completely ridiculous. I've read an interview with Meyer where she said she always planned to write Breaking Dawn, that's its been in her head since the beginning, so I guess she must just be a really awful writer if this is all she came up with way back when. Girlfriend needs an editor - so much of this book is repetitive and drawn-out, and the oddity of having Jacob become a narrator for nearly a third of the novel still baffles me - and I like Jacob. It really seems as if Meyer just sat down and wrote whatever the heck satisfied her whimsy and did not take the time to edit or perfect this book. The plot doesn't enter until after page 500! Before that its just self-indulgence on Meyer's part - taking her time with Bella and Edward's intense yet boring sex life, Jacob's whining, pages and pages of backstory for the vampire \\"witnesses\\" in the final act, and Bella's sci-fi pregnancy that only  took a few weeks in story time but felt like it should have been years from the way Meyer just. kept. going. on.<br /><br />I can't really think of any part of this book that sucked me in the way the other three did - gone is the mystery of Edward's world and the angst of the relationship with Jacob  - both are solved when Bella cops out and becomes a vampire and gives birth to Jacob's soulmate. The fear of the future, of the Volturi, of possibly losing something - all gone so Meyer can make all her characters happy and lame and boring and worthless. I'm no professional writer myself, but I do realize that good, well-written fiction does not benefit from ridiculously pat happily ever afters like the end result of the Twilight series. Problems make good reading. All this build-up from three books ends with a non-battle, a non-climax, and ultimately a non-story.<br /><br />Don't buy this book, people. It's nothing but a badly written cash cow for Meyer and Little Brown. There are better teen supernatural romance novels out there that just didn't have the right packaging or hype. Try The Mediator series by Meg Cabot, A Certain Slant of Light by Laura Whitcomb, or even, gasp, Harry Potter. All those authors planned ahead when writing, stayed true to their characters and to logic, and realize the importance of plot.he relationship with Jacob  - both are solved when Bella cops out and becomes a vampire and gives birth to Jacob's soulmate.

B00004YM0D|5.0|This movie is SO GOOD!!!  It's a true story about a white coach and a black coach in 1950's America who join forces and coach a high school football team who just began integration.  It is about racial equality and handles this subject in a wonderful manner.  I love this movie so much, I can watch it over and over and over.  It is a heartwarming movie and it really makes you think about racial issues, too, in a very good way.  Also, the soundtrack is awesome!!

031606792X|5.0|I disagree with anyone who get's in a fit with how Stepanie Meyer chose to end this series. I disagree with seeing Bella as needy, selfish, clingy, without independence.<br />When you read the first book, you realize, THIS IS A LOVE STORY. THIS IS FICTION. Vampires don't exist, and I think anyone with half a brain, let alone an easily impressive 15 year old, can figure this out.<br />What I get out of this story is a tale that I can lose myself in, that allows me fantasize even for a moment that fairy tales do come true. Granted, my boyfriend is the most amazing boyfriend in the world, but when I read these books I can imagine him as something even more amazing, and powerful. Edward is just another form of Prince Charming that girls can dream of. Realistically, I don't think it has any sort of bad impression on young girls!!<br />I know for a fact that when I was fifteen, all I wanted was to find that boy who would love me forever, hold me while we watched the sunset and I fell asleep in his arms. What teenage girl doesn't fantasize about that?? And that's where Stephanie Meyer hits the nail on the head. She gives all those young girls what they really want, IN FANTASY. She gives you the happy ending you yearn for, not the dissapointment of ruining a beautiful story between Edward and Bella.<br />What would Cinderella have been like had she met her prince, only to lose him before her wedding day?<br />Would the Little Mermaid have been such a happy-go-lucky Disney movie had they done it the real way--the way it's written in Grimm's fairy tales?<br />No, it would not. And little girls around the world wouldn't have something to get lost in, an idea that they could be Ariel and they would meet their prince. Do they actually think that they could be a mermaid and be rescued by Prince Eric? No, of course not! Do teenage girls actually think they'll meet a vampire and live happily ever after (forever!)? Umm, I think no!<br />If you want to complain about the influence that these books will have on a young mind, perhaps you should take a look around you, at what they're watching on the t.v., or seeing on the internet. We live in a world where girls are forced to think being \\"beautiful\\" is necessary to finding their man, and being sexy is what it takes to be accepted.<br />There is no \\"heroine\\" of the story, and no one asks for that. There is no heroine when you turn on the t.v. Why despise a book simply for giving the readers what they want, a little romance and imagination? There is nothing wrong with a modern day fairy tale, which is exactly what this is.<br />I completely agree with the progression of a strong female mind, and gaining independence through yourself and not through the dependence of other, ESPECIALLY not a boyfriend. If parents do their job right, they shouldn't have to worry about a simple book changing all that in their child's minds. If that were the case, movies like \\"Aladdin\\" (where Princess Jasmine just needs her Prince!) or classic tales like \\"Snow White\\"  shouldn't exist, because they, too, put a shameful idea in the mind of a child.<br />Take it for what it is- Bella didn't ask to be a heroine from the start. She only asked to be loved, and to keep that love, and that's what true fairy tales are about. Happy Endings, mushy feelings, and giving a young mind (or a 20-something mind, like myself) a few moments peace from the real chaotic world of romance.n a young mind, perhaps you should take a look around you, at what they're watching on the t.v., or seeing on the internet.

B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Wow this is a great concert (origially titled:\\"We Will Rock You\\") on Blu Ray Disc!!! Includes the classic Montreal preformance + the classic Live Aid stuff as well as some cool extras including a commentary by Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor!!! This title is also available on standard DVD but Blu Ray is the way to go if you have a Blu Ray player!!! For me it was money well spent,much cheaper than a concert ticket,and you have the best seat in the house,and can enjoy it over and over again!!! R.I.P. Freddie Murcury. Very recommended!!! Two tgumbs up!!! A+
0321344758|1.0|Bought because it was on Joel on Software's reading list. Clear and simple, easy to understand. If picked up in a shop, I would not have bought it.    - not much content, lots of whitespace, large fonts, lots of images  - common sense (ie, most of it you probably already know)    Read a few pages, then sent it to a friend who is building her first website.
1401216676|4.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of many fans and since it has the reputation of being one of the best Joker stories in comics. Overall, the story delivers. What you get in this book is a Joker origin story and insight into why the Joker does what he does. His primary motive is to prove just one point, all it takes is just one bad day to drive a man over the edge. He doesn't commit crimes because he thinks they're funny. It's the traumatic experience in his past that has desensitized him to the harm that his violence does. Joker may even have a sort of death wish.     Now for the things that keep this from being a 5 star book. First of all, it is very short. Basically it is just one double-sized comic. That's it, so you'll finish reading this in about 30 minutes. The other thing is that some of the artwork is a bit dated, in particular the way Barbara Gordon is drawn. She is wearing glasses with lenses about the size of coffee cup saucers and appears to be stuck in a time warp that leads back to the 80's. Of course this can't be helped since this was when the story was drawn, but it is a bit distracting when you are compelled to do a fashion check in the middle of a story of this nature.     Overall, I recommend this book for Batman and Joker fans. You won't be disappointed. However, if you haven't read any Batman graphic novels recently, perhaps there are some other books you could start with first such as \\"Batman: Year One\\" or \\"The Long Halloween\\".
B00004W50T|2.0|I really wanted to like this CD because I'm a big fan of Robbie Robertson but I just couldn't.  The music is too dated.  I bought this CD because I had a flash of nostalgia for The Band.  Big mistake.  I doubt that I'll ever listen to this again.  It's not that it's horrible.  It's just really dated, in a bad way, not a good \\"evokes the era\\" sort of way.  Spend your money on something else, like Rocky Votolato or Amos Lee.
031606792X|1.0|I loved all three of the other books, until I read the reviews on amazon.com and realised that I agreed with pretty much everything negative thing written.    Anyway, I gave the books to friends to read, to get their opinion, but they loved it. So I decided that if everyone else found it worthwhile, why be the sour grape?!    I read Breaking Dawn without re-reading Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse first and found it quite 'meh'. 'Meh'- the word that sums up the feelings of not extremely crappy, but not good at the same time. If it was a movie, it would be one that I would never tell anyone to go see.    There was no suspence, no intrigue, no messy anything. The redeeming qualities of New Moon and Eclipse was the 'love triangle'. But the author decided \\"no, dont make the book any where near messy, I want everything to work out fine\\"    So all in all, the book is meh, the plot was meh and the writing- lets just say I have read better sentences from a five year old with no concept of love, and we get the fact that the only redeeming quality of Edward Cullen is that he is attractive and 'shiny'
B000056HE9|5.0|This classic story will always appeal to the heart and soul.  In its charming and gentle way, it reveals the true road to happiness.  It values are gently interwoven into the fabric of the film.  Being a black and white buff, I feel it allows you to be drawn in to the characters and their human struggles with this world.  Brillently casted, this marvelous piece of art will allow you to escape into a world that enriches your soul.
B000A6T262|5.0|I not a Trekkie nerd but the movies and the T.V. series makes for great viewing!
031606792X|2.0|it ended how we all new it should be - in a perfect world.  i'm just sad b/c this series had so much potential. bella never lost anything - no struggle for life, no one close dies.  it was a perfect world - a pathetic hooray. it was a hard book to get through, simply b/c i was so tired of bella's self-depreciating way of seeing herself and her annoying need to please everyone.  edward's obsession with keeping bella safe got old, and jake no longer seemed attractive in that \\"i am life\\" sort of way.  it all just felt very a childish, fairy tale book - which, if you read the ending, was exactly what it was supposed to be.
B00000IQW3|4.0|I used to have this on vhs as a kid and loved it!! (I used to walk around quoting the live from the video game - 'you have been recruited...' etc)    Yeah so the fx are a little dated, and it's a little corny, but I loved this movie, and still do.    Great for any cult sci-fi buff.
1401216676|5.0|I consider myself fairly well-versed in comics, but I've generally steered clear of super-hero comics.  Batman and the X-Men are pretty much the only ones I've touched, but even with those, I haven't really had the urge to delve deeper into their stories.  I've, of course, read the obligatory [[ASIN:1401207529 Year One]] as well as a few side stories here and there, but--like many other people, so excuse me if this sounds band-wagony--I was inspired to pick up some more Batman books after seeing and loving [[ASIN:B00005JPY0 The Dark Knight]].  This graphic novel by the critically acclaimed Alan Moore was first on my list.  And, in my opinion, it's better than \\"Year One.\\"    There is no denying that this book was written by a master.  There are so many moments that either gave me chills or, as a writer, made me burn with envy.  From the Joker's origin flashbacks, to the repetition of the \\"speech\\" Batman gives to the \\"Joker\\" when he first arrives at Arkham, to the subtle line of dialogue that throws the accountability of said Joker origin into question, Alan Moore has written a perfect Batman/Joker story that dissected, examined, and ultimately redefined the way the characters interact and the way the reader experiences them.  It's short, it's horrifying, it's smart as a whip, and it's a cracking good read.    Brian Bolland's realistic art is wonderful--and at times really, really creepy.  We're treated to insight from Bolland, as well as a reprint of a short Batman story titled \\"An Innocent Man\\" (written and illustrated by Bolland) that really ends this collection with a bang.  The overall package is a handsome, over-sized hardcover book.  My only complaint is that it's too big to fit in the shelf next to my other Batman trade paperbacks, but the size and quality of the art is well worth it!    9/10
031606792X|5.0|after passing by this book on several occasions, i finally bit the bullet and picked up the first one.  i finished the first three books in one sitting, and this one was no exception.  at first i was a little thrown off bu this being in the young readers section, but in the end it made little difference, because i was blown away by this series.  although i have never really known any relationshion to be quite so...involved, stephanie meyers told it well.  the whole jacob/bella thing was starting to get on my nerves after a while, and it dragged on a tad to long, but in the end it made for a very good development to the plot that i never would have guessed.    each character had the opportunity to tell their story also, so you werent left guessing what they were all about, she actually let you know.    as i am not a reader of romance, the love story was a little intense, but the action of the book kept me fascinated.    im glad i picked this up and think the people who are giving the lame one star reviews need to be more imaginiative!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I downloaded this book as a free edition and expected a so-so first novel.  Surprise!  A first class sci fi adventure story that captured my attention completely.  Reading this novel gave me the wonderful effect that well written fiction can- the book, or in this case, the Kindle reader- disappears and the reader enters the story seamlessly.  I have since purchased and downloaded the next book in the series, The Ghost Brigades, which I am starting after I post this review.  I recommend this book to all who love a good \\"space opera\\" with crisp writing and interesting plotting.
B000I9YLUI|2.0|I have read this classic Jane Austen story so many times. I have seen so many versions of this classic. But, when I saw this version, I was appalled. The interpretation was modernized and failed in its attempt to remake an adaptation; it proved to be disastrous. First, the setting for the Bennet home depicted them as extremely vulgar. Second, Darcy appeared weak and stupid. Third, the screenwriters completely changed the storyline thus it was not an adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, but a distasteful, unresearched film about a silly girl in a messed up fantasy world that did not depict the 1800's in our world and then a weak and confused, immature male that falls in love with her. It was disgusting.
B00000K3CR|5.0|Never mind the Zoltar Speaks magic ticket, the missing kid whose name is on every milk carton but who happens to be working for a toy company, etc. Forget about it.  Just sit back and enjoy the entertaining, sweet, and touching but never gooey ride.  Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins are wonderful together as the boy in a man's body and a love-starved woman.<br />The kid playing Hanks' best friend is great as well.  And it will remind you of the old adage, \\"Be careful what you wish for--you might get it.\\"
1932100660|5.0|I purchased this and Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn - two books closely related / companions in my opinion. They even talk about each other. Some of this book is a little in-depth for the person who is not interested in scientific studies, but the authors do a pretty good job of putting it all in plain english. This is a great book for anyone wanting to learn about how nutrition relates to food and disease. It is also a great book for learning about the shortfalls of the medical system in America and the politics behind medicine and the food industries. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED reading for anyone who wishes to be in-the-know.    I also appreciate the viewpoint of food and thousands of chemicals in food interacting together to produce good or bad health, as opposed to many other books and studies which take a more isolated approach, such as studying vitamin C and only vitamin C, for example, This book takes a more wholistic approach - meaning that the entire food must be considered in how all things interact, and not just one single element of nutrition alone.
0345495004|5.0|This book is incredible!  The research it took writer Nancy Horan before writing this book is immense.  The detail, discriptions, observations and love of Frank resonates on many levels in this truly great book. It is a tragic and wonderful love story and an important part of American history.                        l[[ASIN:0345495004 Loving Frank: A Novel]]
0679746323|3.0|I must say that I was eager to begin reading this widely appreciated biography. Unfortunately, I was turned off by Mao's self indulgent character. Perhaps one day I will pick it up again, but I didn't want to waste a day of my summer vacation by reading about someone I wouldn't care to meet.
0061245097|4.0|I liked this book more than the first book \\"Halfway to the Grave\\" but in this series it makes sense to read the books in order. I don't think the chemestry between Cat and Bones would come across if you skip the first book.<br /><br />It's four years later and Cat still works for this government agency traking down vampires with her team. Than someone tries to kill her and she accidently runs into Bones at a wedding. She is still not over him and he is also pretty much the only one that can keep her safe from the person who tries to kill her.<br /><br />I thought this books was a lot darker and even more violent than the first one. Halfway to the Grave had some pretty bloody scenes in it as well but some of the scenes in One Foot in the Grave are straight horror movie material. I also thought that Cat was a lot more aggressive. She got so easily pissed off no matter what anyone said and in some situations I just didn't understand what her deal was<br /><br />However, I loved how Bones and Cat got on with their relationship  I loved that they didn't let anyone get in between them. I also liked that there is a lot more about that whole vampire world and there is also a side plot with a Ghoul involved that I liked. I definitely will read the third book in this series as well but I hope that Jeaniene Frost will involve the side characters a little more (maybe a love story with one of Cat's team members since Bones and Cat are rock solid now).
B000005RS6|5.0|As a huge Deep Purple fan, I don't know why I didn't buy this one sooner.  This CD is great sound, a great mix of songs, and Steve Morse just blisters that guitar.  Get this one, quickly, don't pass it by like I did.  This one should get six stars!
044024238X|3.0|This book is about Samantha. She is a lawyer and a total workaholic. She has no private life, no weekends, and her family are all workaholics too. The day she gets promoted to be a partner for her law firm she realizes that she made a stupid mistake in one of her contracts that costs her firm 50 million pounds. She totally freaks out and runs away. Because of a stupid missunderstanding she ends up working as housekeeper for a new-money family. She has no idea what she is doing because she has never ever cooked before or has done any other housework. It is a complete disaster but the gardner, Nathaniel, is the only one that sees that she is a fake. He helps her out and she starts to loosen up and starts to realize that there are other things in live than work.<br /><br />The book was ok. It was very well written but it was also full of cliches. The story was pretty predictable and the ending a little too cheazy for my taste. It was totally ok if you want to read something lite
1577314808|5.0|After I had read the book I thought I understood it.  However, a week later I kept thinking about it and got somewhat confused so I read it again.  Now my wife is reading it.  It really made me think about the wisdom of God.
1416550518|5.0|This book was on every best-selling list in europe and every magazin I read talked about it. Usually I don't like the books on those lists but when I saw that book at the bookstore I bought it anyway, and boy am I glad I did! It is the first book that really touched me in a while.<br /><br />In 1914 Grace started to work at Riverton Manor as maid at the age of 14. Now she is an old woman and she thought she had left the past behind her. But she gets a letter from a woman who is doing a movie about what happened at Riverton so many years ago: The love triangle between the two Harton sisters and the poet R.S. Hunter and his suicide at Riverton. Grace is the only one left alive and she finally decides that she must tell the secret that affected her whole live.<br /><br />I can't really tell more about the plot because it would just spoil too much of the book. I haven't read many books set in this time period so it was really interesting to see how the servants lived and their point of view of their work and the relations to their employers. It was also interesting to see how WWI affected everybody. But the most interesting aspect for me was later in the book when society changed in the 1920s from those old-fashioned times to modern times, similar the way we live now. Hannah, the older sister, was raised in the old-fashioned way and all she ever wanted was to break free. Emmeline, the younger one, had all that freedom Hannah could only dream of and she took full adventage of it.<br /><br />The book started a little slow for me (it is still really good but not much action) but it picks up later with all the tragedies happening. The really, really, really enthralling part is the last part when Hannah, Emmeline and Robbie Hunter manage to get themselves into a love triangle and it comes to a bitter, but surprising, end that choked me up.
0618918248|1.0|I can't believe this guy is a professor of biology and at Oxford and subscribe to such fairy tales as evolution. His arguments contained in this book are so weak and pathetic that it gives real science a bad name.     I can understand where he is coming from when it comes to creationism and religion. There are points in this book I agree with. But you can't put ID in the same boat as creationism. Intelligent Design is a scientific look at God. Creationism is a religious viewpoint of God. Don't be fooled.    As I mentioned on another post, how about if I wrote a book called \\"The Darwin Delusion\\", and how Darwinism is the product of the brain, and can be considered wishful thinking manifested by the human brain. Now there would be a best-seller. I'd probably sell more books than Dawkins.    If you are an atheist, read this book. If you are an open-minded individual, read it with a grain of salt. There are better books out there that deal with real science, and not this pseudo-science!
0385338082|5.0|The story is pretty simple: Emma is a marketing assistant and so far she had no real business success. She gets send to a meeting in Glasgow and that could be her big chance to get a promotion. She totally blows it, gets a little tipsy at the airport and when she thinks her plane is going to crash down she tells all her secrets to the guy sitting next to her. She really spills all: from what underwear she is wearing, to her first sex, and that she waters her co-workers plant with orange juice.<br /><br />She is totally embarrassed when she arrives at the office on monday and finds out that the stranger is the owner of the company she is working for. He took a year off after his best friend died but now he is back in London to check out what has been going on in his company while he was gone.<br /><br />The story was a little predictable but darn funny. I loved how Jack was making smartass comments and teased her about her secrets. And of course they hook up and he is just the sweetest guy ever. But he also keeps a big secret from Emma and that causes some tension between them. That was so far my favorite of Kinsellas' books because it had so many ROFL moments and I just liked Emma so much because she was funny and a \\"normal\\" girl.
B001AZNC7W|3.0|This is a classic album. There are not too many guys who grew up in the eighties without having gone through a rush phase to some degree. I will not list the songs on here simply because they are obvious selections and can be heard on a daily basis on classic rock stations around the world. It is definitely the most hit laden of Rush studio albums, with some lean songs that do not go overboard, and made for FM consumption. Yet, Moving Pictures still manages to strike the fine balance between classic rock and what is deemed progressive. It is just techinical enough to engage better musicians for repeat listening. It is also hooky enough for the average joe. The first side is pretty much the classic A side. The second side leaves you hanging, wondering what happened to the rest of the album.   This is not a review for the LP. However, I have a feeling that it would be well-worth listening to on vinyl (it sounds good enough on my cassette player).
B0017V7GLC|5.0|Last weekend I was at my favorite record store when I took a listen to the new Ladytron cd VELOCIFERO. I always wanted to hear their music but never had the opportunity until now. Needless to say I ended up leaving the store with VELOCIFERO in hand. I haven't been able to stop listening to VELOCIFERO since last weekend. Normally I am not into the sort of dance music Ladytron makes but I really enjoyed all 54 minutes. VELOCIFERO reminded me a mish mash of Lush, My Bloody Valentine, and Goldfrapp from their BLACK CHERRY era. The song that convinced me was \\"Ghosts\\". Helen Marnie reminded me of the women from the Lush with her sweet, intoxicating yet eerie vocals. Helen's vocals is a nice contrast to the often monotonous vocals of Mira Aroyo. I enjoyed all of the songs on the album but my personal favorite song on the album has to be \\"Versus\\". I love the male/female vocals, plus I find the song irresistably infectious. I definitely consider VELOCIFERO one of my top ten favorite albums of 2008.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|If you have read any of the books, let me assure you that while the story line and character names are similar, the story in the movie is different from the books. The views of the colosseum are stunning and also the setting in Egypt. The story moves quickly, the villains are hard to identify: are they the jumpers that steal and cause mayhem, or is it the paladins that trap and the stab the jumpers to death? Will our jumper who we have come to know escape? If so, how does he do it? What happens to the paladins who are after him? JUMPER will show you some of the answers, but leaves open the possibility of a rematch between some of the jumpers and the paladins who remain.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|There are two main criticisms of the HBO miniseries based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams, and I don't understand either of them. The first is that the miniseries makes Adams less admirable than he was in the book. Frankly, that was my main criticism of the book--that McCullough tended to gloss over Adams' well-documented character flaws. To my mind the miniseries presents Adams pretty much as he must have been--vain, petty, quarrelsome, yet also strong, brilliant, courageous, and incorruptible. I find I love the man all the more for his flaws, because he overcame them so wonderfully to become a truly great man.<br /><br />The second criticism is that Paul Giamatti is unconvincing as Adams--a slam that to me is totally unfounded. Who did they want as Adams--Harrison Ford? I think Giamatti was the perfect actor to play Adams, and his performance is as wonderful as I expected it to be. Laura Linney is equally superb as Abigail Adams--if both she and Giamatti don't take home Emmys this year, it will be a screaming injustice--and the entire cast is first-rate, including Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, David Morse as George Washington, Tom Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin, and Sarah Polley, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Kevin Trainor and Samuel Barnett as the Adams' children.<br /><br />Everything about this miniseries seems absolutely right; this is the first drama I've seen about the American Revolution that to my mind captures the look and feel of 18th-century America. And I still can't get the soaring, touching theme music out of my head (two composers, Rob Lane and Joseph Vitarelli, are credited with the music). \\"John Adams\\" is an enthralling miniseries, one of the best in the history of the medium.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|First to start off this review with a positive note.  Coldplay is an awesome band;  they have a cool sound and they make alternative rock even cooler than it is. However, particularly with their last album, X&Y, I've felt that a majority of the media was a bit too kind to Coldplay. Sure, they are one of my favorite bands, but I haven't always felt they were \\"as good\\" as the media has made them out to be.  With X&Y, aside from standouts like \\"What If\\" and the hauntingly, exceptional \\"Fix You\\", it was very similar to A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD.  The chord progression for lead single \\"Speed of Sound\\" was a bit too close to their Grammy-winning turn on \\"Clocks\\".  Sure, \\"if it ain't broke don't fix it\\", but if Coldplay had made another album that cloned the preceding album, then I would've had to complain.  Thankfully, Coldplay enlisted U2 producer Brian Eno to tweak their sound.  And that, Mr. Eno does, making VIVA LA VIDA refreshing as opposed to more of the same.<br /><br />VIVA LA VIDA isn't quite a masterpiece, but it is consistent by Coldplay's standards, and certainly more interesting than X&Y (which was good, but a bit too similar to Coldplay's previous work).  Here, Eno gets the band out of their \\"box\\" and tightens up their sound.  Alongside that, Chris Martin/Coldplay's songwriting appears to be tighter and generally more pleasurable to the ears.  While Coldplay has always had a knack for sound, peaking with 2005's excellent \\"Fix You\\", tracks like \\"Lost!\\" and even the sick guitar riff of \\"Violet Hill\\" show you that Coldplay's three year hiatus wasn't in vain - they were truly \\"tightening up\\" their sound.<br /><br />\\"Life in Technicolor\\" serves as an introduction to VIVA LA VIDA and indicates that the album is going to showcase more \\"colors\\" than the band  has before.  \\"Cemeteries of London\\", the first true selection starts the album off with a bang with haunting sound effects, and an addictive, eery sounding piano riff.  To call it 100% removed from previous Coldplay openers such as \\"Square One\\" or \\"Politik\\" would be an overstatement, but the sound is definitely different.  There is a sense of \\"integration\\" that to me personally wasn't in Coldplay's earlier work prior to this album. \\"Lost!\\" is definitely in my top three of tracks from VIVA.  The organ-synth is one of the most ingenious things I've heard Martin play on keyboards. Furthermore, the drum groove here could be at home on any R&B, Pop, or Hip-Hop album.  Who does that? !?!?!  Even more impressive is the catchiness of \\"Lost!\\" - there is a more inherent pop quality to this track than some of Coldplay's other work.  Maybe it's because of Martin's numerous collaborations with hip-hop artists that a certain heightened tunefulness has evaded his songs.  I know one thing though, I like it!<br /><br />\\"42\\" continues the string of hits (it makes my top five), while \\"Lover in Japan/Reign of Love\\" is also good, though not one of my favorites.  \\"Yes\\" restores any faith I had lost in the band (which was none), while killer singles \\"Viva La Vida\\" and my personal favorite \\"Violet Hill\\" are just exceptional.  \\"Viva La Vida\\" has some killer strings, not to mention Martin's soaring, expressive vocals, or the top-notch songwriting.  As great as the #1 Pop single is, the more underrated, bluesy \\"Violet Hill\\" takes the cake in my eyes.  Never to me has Martin sounded so political, nor so good.  He has always been a strong vocalist, but here on VIVA LA VIDA, he sounds better than he ever has.  His falsetto is immaculate!  \\"Strawberry Swing\\"  and \\"Death To All His Friends\\" end this overall excellent album on a strong note, leaving me no doubts that Coldplay could one day be the greatest band to ever live.  They aren't there yet, despite what the media says, but U2 better watch out as the boys from Britain are out to get them!!! 4 big stars!!!such as \\"Square One\\" or \\"Politik\\" would be an overstatement, but the sound is definitely different.

B0015XHP3G|5.0|really a good remake of Rambo 2, the best in the series in my opinion. clear and fine in HD. the only step back i had was my wish to see arabic subtitle, so i can i enjoy it with friends who do not speak english. but i guess thats the same problem with all new blue ray titles.

1419832212|4.0|Colors are beautiful on HD DVD, however, I think it also exposes how awful acting was in the 1930's.  Errol Flynn looks hopped up on speed.  He races his lines, and shows no emotional depth.  The whole movie itself races along too quickly.  Not really an accurate retelling of the Robin Hood tale.  The huge amount of extras (in HD, thankfully) make up for the flimsy storyline and acting.  This is the only movie on HD from the 1930's.  Casablanca has far better acting, but came out 5 years later, and of course was in black and white.  Robin Hood was one of the first ever color movies, coming out before Fantasia and Gone with the Wind.
031606792X|5.0|There may be some spoilers in this review:    I am very new to the Twilight series, only picking up the first book 5 days ago.  Since the very first page, I have been both captivated and spellbound by the story contained in these four novels, so much so that I have practically bitten the head off of anyone who has distracted me in my quest to find out what happens to Bella, Edward, the Cullen family, and all of the other wonderful characters in this series.  I will admit that I am a sucker for a happy ending when it comes to pleasure-reading.  Not that I don't enjoy a tragic story, but I never fail to feel an immense sense of satisfaction when the characters I love get exactly what they want (with a few bumps along the way, of course).  However, getting exactly what you want should never be too easy, and I was pleasantly surprised that the twisted story in these four novels has kept me on my toes enough to know that any happy ending will not be obtained without previous sacrifice.  Ms. Meyer has created a world as intricate as J.K. Rowling, and it isn't since the ending of the Harry Potter series that I have felt more of an attachment towards a group of fictional characters.  That said, Breaking Dawn is my favorite novel of the four.  I did not find it hard to identify with Bella once she became a vampire.  In actuality, I appreciated her more than I have for the entire series.  For anyone who does not like that Bella was turned into a vampire, I am not sure why.  Indeed, vampire life is something that suits her so well it is hard to believe that she was ever human when reading her story.  It is nice to see that Bella has finally found her place in the world.  For someone who always felt lost, even when she found Edward, Bella in vampire form is a lovely sight to behold...it is as if all of the problems surrounding her and Edward's relationship prior to Bella's change were inconsequential, that this is what Bella was truly meant to be.  More than that, I don't see why every character in literature has to be a role model for children.  That is a heavy burden to place on the author, especially considering that most real people are not role models themselves.  I think it is more realistic that the characters have flaws.  Even when I was my most angry with Bella (or Jacob) in Eclipse, further thought made me realize that people are not perfect, especially not characters in literature, nor should they be.      There is so much to say about this book that I could write for hours (or maybe even 750 pages or so).  The bottom line is that this book is a conclusion worth reading.  Yes, everyone is happy, and everything is nicely wrapped up in a bow.  But Ms. Meyer does this so effectively and cunningly, with such creativity, that it is impossible to mind this sort of pat conclusion (even if you aren't a happy-ending lover, such as myself).  Things aren't as easy as they appear in this book, there is still conflict to resolve (even if it isn't between Bella and Edward).  I am grateful that Ms. Meyer gave her readers an opportunity to see what happens after Bella and Edward get their happy ever after, even for only a little bit.  It was nice to see them together and happy, it is what I myself have been reading the last three books for.  Tortured love is exciting, but what is more fulfilling than a stable and happy relationship (in book form and in real life).  The bottom line is this, for all those who weren't hoping for a completely happy ending, where everyone gets what they want, don't read a fairy tale.  Because that is what the Twilight series truly is, a fairy tale that is both conventional and unconventional, but never boring.  Every fairy tale deserves a happy ending, and Ms. Meyer delivered one that was both satisfying and exciting.
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first book, I thought it was beautifully written and the story line was amazing; but after that first book, in my opinion its all gone down hill from there especially with Breaking Dawn. I found it so very disturbing and not in a good way. It did not make you think, it in fact made you never want to read a book from the twilight saga again. I personally believe the book was on par with a really bad science fiction novel aimed at 13 year old girls. And by the way, the message this book conveys is not one that a 13 year old girl should listen to.    I'm 17 years old and in a very serious relationship that quite possibly will turn into marriage, and for all of you out there who read this book and thought that it was an accurate portrayal of real love and think that that will happen to you, you are seriously mistaken. Young love does not include great cars, vasts amounts of money, family support, or dream like weddings at 18.    Yes its a fantasy novel, but fantasy novels and fairy tales also show the realities of situations and this book did not do that.    It was disgusting and a sad point in Stephenie Meyers writing career. She can write brilliantly and tell one hell of a good story but when it comes to wrapping up the end of this saga it seemed like she took the worst ideas from fanfiction because she was just too tired to think of a creative, original, and brilliant ending that would have done this series justice.    This book just put me in a bad mood and if I were you I would only read twilight because after that, Bella just gets too whiney, over dramatic, and plays the victim all too often for my taste. I really wish she would have turned into the strong female roll model that I hoped she would instead of being completely dependent on Edward for everything, including happiness.    If you must read it check it out at the library because this book is really and truly not worth that paper its printed on.
B0017MO10U|5.0|For fans of the first eight seasons of SG-1, this is a must-have. Not only is the filming far beyond what I'd expect to see on TV, the acting (especially by Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black) is outstanding. For those who like action, the CGI was good (though thankfully limited) and it's really hard to beat the big shots provided by the Arctic and all that military hardware! It was also very nice to see bit parts played by real armed forces personnel, just as in the past. Being a fan of time travel and alternate universe themes myself, the plot was well-done and was quite a bit different than what they've done in the past. The only complaint I might have would be that there was no forward movement in the development of the main characters, something to be expected in AT/AU stories.     However, I did come away with a much better appreciation for Cam Mitchell, which is a big deal for me.  I also never cared for Vala up until now- but Vala/Qe'tesh was superb in this movie, thanks to Claudia Black. Though his part wasn't big, it was great seeing O'Neill again, especially Colonel O'Neill, and it looks like there's still something up with the General and Carter. In general, though, this is an action film and all of the  character interactions are necessarily brief. Another ten minutes of run time could have given us that great team banter back again, and there were flashes of that, but they were limited by (I presume) aiming for a two-hour TV time slot.    All in all, I'd say the movie was technically very nice, exciting to watch, had a few nice character moments, and carries the story arcs developed in SG-1 very well. Since Ark of Truth and Continuum were great caps to two of the main story arcs, I'm looking forward to new adventures in future movies and maybe find out what the heck O'Neill has been up to the last few years, because certainly it seems that the SG-1 saga is far from over.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Okay, so I've just gotten into anime, and have only seen about 30 anime movies, but this is by far the best I've seen to date. I bought Howl's Moving Castle a while back and decided to get everything I could involving Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli and I was a amazed that I liked this movie even better than Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away. I'm a nature lover too, so this movie really hits the right note with me.
0930289234|5.0|The most acclaimed graphic novel of all-time, this collects the seminal twelve-issue \\"Watchmen\\" 1986-1987 DC Comics mini-series written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons.  This self-contained, marginally fictional universe is mostly set in mid-1980s New York City during a fifth Nixon term and heightened cold war tensions.  The main characters are ex-superheroes (based on old Charlton Comics characters but unique to this series) that have been banned by the US government and now seem to be mysteriously disappearing.  Besides the nearly omnipotent blue giant Dr. Manhattan, these heroes are mostly simple masked vigilantes without superpowers.  Fictional primary source material (magazine articles, book excerpts, letters, etc.) appears between each issue to provide further background on the characters.<br />Since a new hardcover edition is coming out in November 2008, Amazon is currently selling this 400-plus page TPB for only $11 - one of the best deals I've ever seen them offer.  There's enough in this regular edition to render any \\"deluxe editions\\" superfluous.  I'll see and probably enjoy the March 2009 movie but there's no way that all of the rewarding intricacies of this story will make it to the big screen.  Read this first!
B0006A9FMI|3.0|The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is the PG-13 rating, which you can tell in the movie they strived for. No gore at all! Not that gore is the number one factor in an anime, but it feels like a more kid friendly version of the first movie. Also, with Studio Ghibli being involved, I thought the animation would be better.
B000002GWJ|5.0|This is the first album I ever heard from Tom Waits and it is fantastic.  I borrowed it from a co-worker and he told me that if I want to hear something really different that will grow on me in time, then give this a listen.  His music is very different than any other I have heard, and his lyrics are out of this world.  His voice took a few listens to get used to, (he almost sounds like Bob Dylan's current voice), but now I really like the heart and soul that pours out of his voice as he grinds through the lyrics.  If you have heard of him, give this a listen, you will not be sorry.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|When I got this, I was weary about it looking dated due to it being over 20 years old. Nothing could be farther from the truth as the animation and storyline put to shame most other animated movies of today. Really awesome and entertaining movie.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|It is hard to find a truly clear and crisp live album from the early 1970s, but Live at Massey Hall is the best older live album I have ever heard period.  Neil Young sounds so young, full of soul, and all of the tracks are phenominal.  Many of these tracks have not been released at the time this was recorded (pre-Harvest), with a few tracks differing from what was released later on album (i.e. A Man Needs a Maid), and a unreleased track (i.e. Bad Fog of Loneliness).  I am a huge Neil Young fan and this quickly became a favorite.  If you love his solo acoustic side, you will love this live cd.  Buy it, you will not be sorry!
B0001XAPY2|3.0|Someof the elements in this movie have that Studio Ghibli magical touch, but most of it is too \\"real\\" for me to enjoy. Yeah, the guy's a pic and that's \\"magical\\", but that's about it. Too many flying scenes as well.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|A must see for anyone who loves life, love and friendships. An amazing finale for years of good work!Enjoyed it a lot.
6304493681|4.0|I saw this for the first time a few days ago when I bought it. I'm new into the world of anime and after buying all the Studio Ghibli stuff, this was recommended to me when I stated I wabted to branch out more. I like the animation style, and the fact that there's gore where the second movie didn't have much.
B00005JLR2|3.0|Pirates and kids are always a hit.<br />This movies translates a children's classic tale<br />from the Atlantic Ocean to the space of the galaxy<br />in a Star Wars mix of technology, Robots and cute little aliens ( Morphy).<br />Mutiny comes at an unexpected time, but the captain, the astronomer and Jim<br />make it away alive. Getting back the ship and bringing back the treasure<br />is another story altogether and it brings young Jim to his<br />full abilities and courage.<br />The technology seems more like magic and space like a small ocean,<br />but the fantasy is pretty flawless?<br />It is a fun movie, but lacks that classic edge due to the Disney 'formula' approach?
B00005JLEU|5.0|When I first got into Miyazaki/Ghibli movies, I started out with Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke. I liked them so much I bought EVERY other movie they released, hoping the rest would be just as good, and they are. After Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is my fave. What I like about it is of course the story, but also the fact that this is one of Studio Ghibli's most deeply/richly colored movies. Ghibli seems to favor the softer more airy and light colored approach, but this has a really deep almost water color look to it.
B00005JPMZ|3.0|A  sequel reuniting the brother turtles against nearly<br />supernatural/ immortal stone warriors doesn't really<br />change the major plot line or introduce any innovations<br />in character, dialog  or outcome?<br />The bad guys die and the good guys go on as usual?<br />Even children get bored with the same old same old...
B0006J28BO|3.0|This is basically a fullm movie expanding on some of the ideas you may have seen in Whisper Of The Heart. The whole thing moves at on odd pace, and is usually too slow for me. Would be good for the younger female crowd. Doesn't have a broader age appeal like Howl's Moving Castle has.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM. A HAPPY FILM WITH NO VIOLENCE, JUST JOY.  I RECOMMEND THE  ROMANTIC COMEDY FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY. A MUST!!!!!
B0015519VS|5.0|An album to listen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
0345494768|5.0|The title of the book says it all.  This is THE definitive collection on the making of Star Wars.  Of course there were tons of documentaries being made after the initial film was a huge success but since nobody really knew what was going on with this strange film, film and video footage is sparse at best.  This gives us all the insight we could want about the making of this space fantasy.  Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, you will love this record of this high budget independent film.
B000W4KT64|5.0|The movie is energetic, entertaining, funny, and has a great anti-prejudice theme.    People are all not the same-those with darker skin are not inferior, or the fact that all women aren't a size 6, yet can be beautiful, is nicely brought out in the movie's plot.       I liked everyone's performance in the film, but I think that John Travolta stole the show. Nikki Blonsky was terrific as an overweight, yet confident, teenager. Her energy, and the energy of the film, made this film so enjoyable.    In spite of any negatives anyone may say about John Travolta in drag, I think he was convincing and fun to watch. And I think the role was a risky venture for him that was worth doing.      I would watch this film again and again.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|I got this CD for one song - \\"Mercury Blues\\" done the right way, as it was written (sorry Alan Jackson, your version is great, but it doesn't ring my bell like the original). Along with the \\"Blues\\" I got Fly Like an Eagle and the rest. Very nice package deal with lots of great songs from the 70's and 80's you'll enjoy all over again. If you're under 25, then you're about to discover solid 24K gold for your eardrums.
B000WQW988|5.0|I had been looking for this DVD for years.  I am not a huge Nirvana fan, but this is a must have for any early 90's music fan.  A true treasure for the music enthusiast.
6305882592|5.0|Quirky story of love and living a life. Makes you think about the difference between creating a picture perfect existence to please everybody else and what it means to live life on your own terms. Makes you happy to be alive. I would call it an esoteric cult classic, except I've never met a person who didn't love this movie.
B00003CXIP|1.0|I bought this movie recently. I had never heard of it before, but it was cheap, and it sounded like something my 11 and 10 year old sons might enjoy (my husband too, since he's always been an outdoorsman).   We all sat down to watch, and first off, I was annoyed by the boys smoking. On the back cover, it said that the kids 'sneak' smokes. Well, they acted like pros at it! Not like a kid just 'giving it a try' and gagging and coughing, but they acted like it was something they always did, like it was ok. I started smoking back at that age, and I try to stress to my kids that it's NOT ok, and it's a horrible habit to kick!  Secondly, the language! OMG! I wanted to crawl in a hole with every other word being a swear word! Heck, I swear, my husband swears, and Lord knows, kids all around them swear, but we don't do it in the house, and we certainly don't want the kids doing it! It's fine to put a word in here and there, shoot, all the movies do! But I didn't think the amount used in this movie was necessary.  Then there's the gun and knife. It's not cool to cop a gun from your 'old man'! And it certainly isn't cool to point it at someone, and cock it?? OMG!! My sons have been hunting since they were 8 years old. They know what a gun is used for, and it certainly isn't used for pointing at a bully!    Anyway, I'm not a prude in any way, shape, or form, but I was hoping this movie would teach my boys that sure, life is hard, we all have issues in our lives, but we can learn and grow from our situations. We don't need to do it by 'smoking' or carrying a gun!  Sure, it had touching moments where the boys cried about issues they had, but that was it. It just showed the issues, it didn't give any clue as to where the boys could go, what they could do, or how they could better themselves. They found the body, and went home to their horrible lives...just as they did before they ventured out.   JMOP,  Dana
B0017XFBMG|5.0|OK, this is one of those projects that was built up by internet buzz for over three years. As such, the opportunity for disappointment and failure to meet expectations was high. I am a skeptic by nature and especially of the sort of buzz and hype that preceded this release.    Holy ****ing &%$#!!! If you've never been to a Pogues show, but know the material, listen to the live cuts of Sally MacLennane, Dirty Old Town, and The Sickbed of Cuchulainn first. These will confirm what Macgowan has always said, says on the rambling docu-bio \\"If I Should Fall From Grace. . .\\", that the Pogues should be recorded live. The energy on those tracks, from the band and the audience is truly extraordinary, and takes me back to New York in the late 80's when I first heard some of this music (at McSorley's Pub on E. 6th St; a night on which I was almost beaten for something unkind a companion said about the Irish). It's raw, it's warm, it's grrrreat fun, and it's a lasting beauty that attends little in popular music, say maybe Bob Dylan and a very few others.    Everything has been said in the other reviews about this set. I can only echo: \\"when will the other five discs be released\\"? And: \\"how about a tour of the US (not just the Northeast)?!\\" The fact that Shane MacGowan is still alive (look for a prediction of his imminent death to appear in print at least twice a year) is a marvel, and though I do actually say a prayer now and then that he will get sober (at 51 how much longer can he last?), his persistence in breathing the air is a testament to the energy and vitality of the music that flows through him and the band. I enjoy all of this, including the slurred singing from Shane-O (which, incidentally, has as much to do with his very poor dental health as the drinking). The variety, the new stuff, the old stuff in new versions, even the cinematic instrumentals are all a joy. Buy this if you like the Pogues, The Popes,  and the genre they spawned, even a little bit. A keeper, a joy, a marvel. Thank you Phil Chevron for this great labor of love. May the Pogues (and Shane) be around and playing another 25 years!
031606792X|1.0|So many things wrong with this book. Plot doesn't follow previously set rules, characters are out of character, book is hardly edited. It was very hard to read through, I found myself rolling my eyes at least once each page, and throwing the book away from my line of vision praying that SM was joking. During the birth scene I almost vomited \\"fountains of blood\\" right along with Bella. Would have made more sense a standalone (although that would also be a stretch). Waste of time.
B0010X745K|1.0|If you read... If you like your movies based on books to resemble the book it was based on...     If you have any humanity whatsoever...    DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS.    This \\"movie\\" (and i do use the term sarcastically) takes a wonderful short story by Stephen King into the back room of an underground club, does unspeakable things to it, then tells it to put the lotion in the basket.    The \\"screenwriter\\" (and i do use the term sarcastically... YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!) has killed a good story. He has killed it, and done bad things to the body...
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Product came in 3 days.  Plays all but last song on CD.  Contacted the seller a week ago about the problem but have received no answer from them.  Not their fault as it was sealed and new but the Customer Service seems to suck.
0743289692|5.0|I know the purpose of a review is to comment on the book, rather than other reviewers.  However, I must say that giving one star to this book because other women have gone through \\"worse\\" or that the reviewer doesn't agree with Ali's personal feelings is, to me, utterly ridiculous.  This is her story and her coming of age.  Do we minimize her amazing story because her repeated beatings weren't as \\"bad\\" as other women? Do we ignore her story because we don't agree with her? No. This is her story, her life, and her journey.  She's not telling you to agree with her. I myself wonder at her ability to survive it all. Her intellectual and emotional feelings about Islam, again, are HER feelings.  I'm certainly not an expert on Islam, but I feel it is condescending and patronizing to state that she confuses religion with culture.  She's lived with and in Islam all her life: doesn't that make her rather an expert on the subject?  You may not agree with the path she has taken, but please don't minimize her understanding of Islam or her journey.

B000SW4DLM|4.0|I love Blade Runner. But my 3 star rating has to do with version unbox downloaded for rental. I'm not hip to the names of the various versions, but I had heard there was one with an annoying Decker narration... FYI - The version provided through unbox is, of course, that one. I think it was essentially added to the film to help those who like their films spoonfed - maybe for tv/cable release. I'm kind of annoyed about this because it is totally distracting.
031606792X|1.0|First of all let me say that I was well aware of SMeyer's writing skills from her first 3 books. She lacks a lot of basic sentence structure and the simplest notions of subtlety and plot development. I liked her stories because she had a neat idea. The characters (some) seemed cool and could have been expanded upon. Instead of writing this well and with a better plot, she seems to have chosen the most basic, quickest and stupidest route in writing Breaking Dawn.    I don't think I've ever read a story where EVERY SINGLE possible happy ending occurs. I mean really, who does that? Perfectly flawless Bella is not a person I can admire. She is in no way approachable, sensible or even clever. A writer should not rely on TELLING the reader that Bella is awesome. Bella should prove it herself. The more SMeyer repeated how everyone thought the world of Bella, and how Bella is all self-effacing to the max, the more I disagreed with this sentiment. Bella is a farce of a character. She has no development, lives a too perfect life and has gone beyond all rules of fiction. Yes, writers have the write to make everything up, obviously. But a little bit of rationale and reality always goes further than sheer ignorance to anything remotely normal or human.     SMeyer, please learn to write without explaining everything to us. Give readers some respect. Teach kids how to write, don't teach the opposite.  It would help you in the future, really. Don't pander to the obvious. Give characters a chance to prove themselves worthy of our respect. Don't tell us to like them because we should. We won't. If I don't feel anything for the main character, then I feel nothing for the book.    The plot 'twists' weren't even twisty. I saw the pregnancy a mile off. Why? Because it was absurd. Honestly, if she was going to set us up to not expect pregnancy, I was sure (about 2 chapters in) that it was inevitable. I felt like she threw it in at the end.     Edward is not perfect. If I had a guy watching me without my permission, or ruling my life and telling me what to do, I'd call the cops. The fact he sounds like the American dream makes it worse. This wasn't supposed to be Sweet Valley High. In fact, SVH was better. It was better when I was 12. This would be terrible if I was 12. I'm not 12 and I know this sucks.    The only serious issue in all of this is : I'm probably going to buy Midnight Sun. Only hoping SMeyer will have cleaned up her act and can pass it off as readable. Why? Because I like laughing at her mistakes. This is terrible and a waste of my money and she's probably getting too much money already. I can't even get my money back because these books HAVE to be dissected and rewritten in my head.     SMeyer: Sorry. Bombed the book. Good job.
031606792X|2.0|I, as well as many others, am deeply disapointed with Stephanie Meyer'sfourth book in the Twilight series. For the first 500 pages, I felt that the plot was very simple and wasn't leading up to anything big. The plot basically consisted of two questions: \\"Is Bella going to turn into a vampire?\\" and \\"Is Bella going to survive the pregnency?\\",both of which are very simple Yes/No questions. For the next 200 pages, the author attempted to incorporate theVolturi into the book to add an element of excitement and fear. I felt that the transitioning into the second part of the plot was done very poorly, and thus, wasn't very climactic or exciting at all. It took 100+ pages to describe all of the vampires the Cullens rounded up to \\"wittness\\" against the Volturi, which I believe was way too long. I feel that the ending was also done very poorly...it didn't provide a good sense of closure, and left many questions still unanswered: Is Bella going to college with Edward? Is Bella going to ever tell Charlie/Renee of what she truly is? Is there going to be a conflict between Jacob and Nahuel? Are Sue and Charlie going to get married? (The author merely hinted at this). Stephanie Meyer was trying to write a Harry Potter novel that was 800 pages long, but what  many authors fail to understand is is that length is not desired; the quality of the novel is. Very few authors can write an 800 paged novel and keep it exciting. Clearly, Stephanie Meyer is not one of them.

B000H6SXMY|4.0|This is a hard once since we are talking about 40 something disks and hours and hours of viewing.  Several of the disks had problems skipping etc and the finally would not play at all.  So we paid big bucks to have all the disks together and we still have to hang on too all the old VHS tapes and other DVD's to actually have the whole show.  Of course the seller ignored all of our attempts to perhaps fix the problem.
B00005JPO1|4.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull made it to the discount theater, so it was time to see it. It was enjoyable but not really as good as the first 3 movies. They really made Harrison Ford look even older than he is, but the young guy, Mudd, was really hot. The plot took a goofy X-Files kind of direction (\\"The Truth is Out There...\\") and the special effects were too computerized to be as much fun as they were in the first 3 Indy films. At one point, the young Mudd (Shia LeBoeuf) character asks Indy, \\"What are you, like, 80?\\" It's OK, that's what we're all thinking. I think they were trying to make poor Harrison look like the rather decrepit Sean Connery. The next offering will likely be, \\"Indiana Jones and the Quest for a Decent Medicare Prescription Plan.\\" We finally find out whatever happened to the vodka-guzzling Indy girl (Marian) from the first movie, as she is back, still fab but now a bit dumpy-looking (of course, it has been about 30 years). Instead of the Nazis, we now have the Commies embodied primarily by the fabulous Cate Blanchett, playing Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle (\\"must get moose and squirrel...\\") The wholesale slaughter of a mezzo-American Indian tribe was a little less than PC, but what does one expect from the Red Menace? Overall, and despite a plot with an identity crisis, the movie was formulaic and predictable but still quite fun for us die-hard Indy fans. Did I mention that Shia LeBoeuf, as Mudd, is HOT? He should be quite fun in the next sequel, as long as we don't have to wait until he's an octogenarian. Of course, someone may need to tell Mudd that he is not the Fonz.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is not only an amazing comic, but an amazing novel as well. Originally a 12 part comic book series, the graphic novel \\"Watchmen\\" is a must read for comic book fans and fans of drama novels. If you think this is a common superhero novel, think again. The group of heroes this book tells about have no super-powers, except for one. This book deconstructs the basic superhero archetype and gives us human superheroes. Characters like the Nite Owl and Rorschach suffer from all kinds of problems that everyday human beings go through. \\"Watchmen\\" is a very human story. Now, the story is set in an alternate 1985 and it deals with the death of one of the heroes and the finding out of who did it while in the meantime, America is ever closer to a nuclear war with Russia. They are many flashbacks that tell the back story of the main characters and these flashbacks relate to the current story. In addition, there are many twists and moments that will have you on the edge of your seat. The book has a very cinematic quality to it and Dave Gibbons art is iconic while Alan Moore's story telling is legendary. Never before have I been so immersed in a comic book before. Once you pick this one up, you can't put it down. Reading it once does no justice, you have to (and you will) read again and again. I have read hundreds and hundreds of novels in my life and \\"Watchmen\\" is one of the best and most important novels I have ever read. You can relate to the characters and their situations so much; you forget that you're reading a comic. All in all, if you've never read a graphic novel, start here. \\"Watchmen\\" is a must read and a must buy for comic fans, or drama fans. Now that the movie is coming, this book will fly off the shelves. Buy it, read it, love it, read it again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is going to make you sweat. Jillian provides a short work out that is as intense as a \\"Cathe\\" work out. The moves are simple to follow. You will definely feel like you worked out when you are done with one of her segments.
B000002UYZ|3.0|If you've spent any time burning your own audio CDs (i.e. \\"Redbook\\" CDs as they are known in optical media world), then you probably quickly figured out that all 26 tracks will easily fit on one standard CD-R (or, if you know your blank CDs, that'll be a Taiyo Yuden!).    So, why are we \\"given\\" two CDs?  Easy?  So the record company can charge $23 instead of $13.    Of course, the label's reason (read: pandering excuse) is that they are being \\"faithful to the original release.\\"  Since when are COMPILATIONS considered to be \\"original releases\\"??  Even classic packages such as Marley's \\"Legend\\" merely cherry pick the best (and best-selling) songs from his albums--just as every other \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Best of\\" disc does.    The VERY least that the label could have (SHOULD) done was to add extra tracks.  God knows the Fab Four recorded enough hits and out-takes in order to fill these two discs out with a plethora of B-sides, different takes of classic songs, and sides that were unreleased for one reason or another.    Those of us who pay attention wouldn't be sitting around wondering why so many albums by so many albums lesser groups are jammed to the gills with studio cast-offs, lame live versions and the occasional gem.  (E.g. look at the \\"remastered\\" version of \\"Who's Next\\", a half-baked attempt to \\"recreate\\" the failed \\"Lighthouse\\" project, whose only notable result was the greatest album the Who and Pete Townshend ever recorded.)    Even scraping the bottom of the barrel (creatively at least) they could slapped an interview onto one of the discs.  The remastered version of Tull's \\"Thick As A Brick\\" has a fascinating 13-14min interview recorded around the time the album was made.    What serious Beatles' fan wouldn't want to hear a good interview with the group, especially one from the period right before the became The Biggest Band in History, selling more than 170,000,000 records (that's more than Elvis and Barbara Streisand combined!).    Bottom line is:    Thegreat songs are here (most of them anyway, \\"Twist and Shout\\" anyone?).  The CDs sound is excellent; I'd love to a Mobile Fidelity version!    But this package could have been fully fleshed into something interesting, something perhaps even special.  That way the $23 we shelled out for this \\"two\\" disc set would have been worth it.     Yet with this Beatles' set we get exactly what we would have paid for in 1967.    Hello, record company executives!!  It's 40 years later.  Time to get a clue.  Instead of taking advantage of the 80-82 mins ea. CD gives them, the label decided to pretend they still had to work within the time constraints, between 45 and 50 mins using both sides.    And they wonder more and more people are downloading more and more music: they can pick exactly the songs they want without what used to be called \\"filler\\"--but is nowadays called \\"hit singles\\".
B000HF0IIC|1.0|This movie is second only to Batman and Robin in defining bad comic-book films. Catwoman was better than this. Avoid as if it will make you stupider for watching it, because it probably will.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|John Adams is an honest and engaging exploration of an extra-ordinary, everyman with lots of flaws, foibles, and virtures.   More than anything else, the movie touched me personally and provided an opportunity to examine my own life and how I might do better.  Paul Giamati and Laura Liney made me believe they were John and Abigail Adams as real people, not historical figures.   With the exception of David Morse, playing George Washington, I felt that I was seeing the real people behind the historical figures, contradictions and all.  The quality of the sets, costumes, and  re-enactors was very high.  The only real criticism that I have is that I think the mini-series could have been shortened a bit.   Some scenes just went on longer than necessary to make the point.
0385340990|4.0|The laundry isn't done, the dishes are still in the sink, the bed isn't made, and the floor never got vacuumed today. Why? I started this book at lunch, thinking I would get in a few minutes of reading time, and I ended up sitting on the back deck in the sunshine all afternoon until I finished the final page.<br /><br />And I don't regret it!<br /><br />This is a charming, endearing, touching, and gut-wrenching novel. Juliet, an author in her own right, corresponds with best friends Sophie and Sidney (also her publisher) and by chance ends up exchanging letters with Dawsey, who lives on the island of Guernsey. He contacts Juliet about his favorite author, Charles Lamb. The two strike up a long-distance correspondence that brings in other Guernsey residents and members of the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society: the delightful Isola, John Booker, Amelia, Eben, Clovis, Will, Eli, and the nails-on-chalkboard Adelaide Addison, among others.<br /><br />When Juliet travels to Guernsey to meet the people who have become so special to her, her life is changed in so many ways. Her work on a new book changes direction to focus on Elizabeth, the spirited young woman who faced up to the Germans, formed the Literary Society, and influenced each member of the group forever. Juliet learns of the heartbreak her friends endured during the grueling occupation of the island by the Germans.<br /><br />I have always loved epistolary novels - in the right hands, a novel told through people's correspondence creates such incredible characters, and I think Shaffer and Barrows manage to do just that. I truly cared about these characters, and I couldn't wait to get to the next letter to get a peek into their current lives or a better understanding of what it was like for them on that island during the occupation. It's too bad that Ms. Shaffer did not live long enough to enjoy the success of her first novel, but I hope that this book finds its way into many more hands. Bravo!
1843106698|5.0|I read this book by pure chance (first I read [[ASIN:0307275655 Thinking in Pictures, Expanded Edition: My Life with Autism]]) because I know a child who has difficulties to learn at school. And I buy this book to have a good scientific reference on AS and high functioning autism. And I was satisfied beyond the limits but for someone else so much closer to me. Believe me this book will make you understand a lot of people around you. Even you are not in relation with autism, you will learn a lot. But if you are in touch with a person with the asperger syndrom, believe me too, you will learn more and, above all, feel better in your life. Unfortunately I am very close to an adult with high functioning autism (or AS). Sometime you could think this adult is a total idiot in social relationships. This book bring complete informations about the subject. And the life is much easier when you understand you are not a kind of social monster.
B00168ML1G|5.0|Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by \\"Marvelizing\\" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.    The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what reallydrives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.

B000AQJPQE|3.0|We actually purchased this light from our local hobby lobby store.  It was marked down from 30.00 to 20.00.  It was pretty easy to put together and screw to the ceiling..however like others said it is loud and mechanical sounding.  The light is VERY dim, I'm pretty sure our plug in night light is brighter.  The only problem I have with this is the noise and the fact that it sits too close to the ceiling.  I wish they would make something like this that could be wired in directly to light switch.      I am not going to take it down and return it.  I think it should be about a 10 dollar light NOT the 30.00 orig price.

031606792X|2.0|Well, the hype is over (well, for me anyway).  After reading the first 3 books in the Twilight series last month, I couldn't wait to read Breaking Dawn.  I managed to be one of the first people on the wait list at my local library.  When I went to pick it up, I was told the check out period was 2 weeks instead of 3 weeks due to the high number of people on the list.  My intent was to start it that night, but other things prevented me from doing so.  I didn't start reading it until five days later.       The beginning pretty much picked up where Eclipse left off.  Bella and Edward are engaged and eventually marry.  I have to admit the engagement, wedding and honeymoon dragged on for me.  I struggled through and hoped it would get better (after all, I had more than 700 pages to read).  I have to say the story did pick up and no sooner than it did, it just fell apart in some many places.    After I read the last word, I closed the book and thought \\"What just happened?\\"  This book was far different than the first three.  For starters, it wasn't as gripping and I literally had to keep forcing myself to just use my imagination and \\"go with it\\".   And I couldn't...     To say I am disappointed, is an understatement.  For me, the best part of the book was Book Two, Jacob's perspective.  I really like Jacob.  Initially, I was disappointed that Bella didn't choose him over Edward.   But as my dislike for Bella grew in Eclipse, I was happy.  He deserved better than Bella.  However, who he finally imprints with was a let down (but quite obvious).  It was weird and somewhat creepy.    The ending wrapped up too nicely and the battle with the Volturi was very anti-climatic.  For me, Breaking Dawn just didn't flow with the rest of the series. (2.5/5)
031606792X|1.0|Love Stephanie Meyer & the first three books in the Twilight series...  Even enjoy \\"The Host\\".  I was looking forward to the release of this book - and began to read it at lightening speed as soon as I got my copy - although my speed and desire to read the book decreased every minute I got further into the book.  Please, do not ruin the first three books by reading this last one.  Just know that Belle & Edward get married and live happily ever after.  Jacob copes with losing Belle, but he imprints in the end and his world is now complete.
0307387178|5.0|Into the wild is a story of a young man searhing for more out of life. He goes on a journey into the depths of Alaska but doesn't live to tell his tale.    Krakauer decides it's his job to tell McCandless' story on his behalf. With only a journal and a few eye witnesses Krakauer pieces together McCandless trip from beginning to end. He even writes himself into the story eplaining his own mountain climbing trip to the Devils Thumb. He uses so much description that you feel yourself walking on thin ice, fearing that at any moment you could fall to your death.   McCandless and Krakauer share many things in common for example they both went into the wild searching for answers but on Krakauer's voyage he didn't receive any of them. Another similarity they shared is their screwed up relationship with their fathers.   Throughout McCandless pilgrimage he touched the lives of many people he met along the way. And they all had their side of the story to tell. They made had their doubts and opinions to why McCandless left in the first place but it never stopped them for keeping a special place in their hearts for him.   The story is such a tragic one and while reading this book I admit I shed a few tears but no matter how hard it became to read about this unfortunate tale I just couldn't put it down. Every chapter Krakauer left you wanting more. I just had to know how it ended from the moment I started reading. We can all relate to this book because I think we all have a little bit of McCandless in us. No matter how we feel about the choices McCandless made we all have to confess this if probaly one of the best nonfiction books ever written and I must congratulate Krakauer for being able to pull it off so well. Thats why it deserves five stars.

1401302378|4.0|The digital age has thrown a curve ball at traditional economic theory. Disrupting the institutionalized notion that economics is about choice under scarcity, the Internet has introduced economists to a world of abundance.<br /><br />Chris Anderson's book The Long Tail examines the non-traditional markets that emerge when people are faced with abundance and infinite selection. This model allows the public to deviate from the accepted norm of being fed \\"hits\\" that are corporately designed for mass-appeal. Anderson's Long Tail theory proves that by opening the door for consumers to access niche choices and tools of creation, the Internet has unveiled a means of \\"turning unprofitable customers, products, and markets into profitable ones\\" (p. 11). The Long Tail refers to the market share that is made attainable by the Internet's introduction of \\"abundant shelf space, abundant distribution, and abundant choice\\" (p. 143).<br /><br />In The Long Tail, Anderson effectively presents engaging ideas that are muted only by the book's sometimes-scattered structure. Anderson uses real-world examples to make his points, leads readers to evaluate their own consumer habits, and upholds the context that the Long Tail is part of a bigger picture. At times Anderson is redundant, and the book lacks the guidance of a defined genre, but compared to The Long Tail's strong overall message, the points of contention are minimal.<br /><br />Using real-world examples, Anderson effectively teaches readers how the digital age is empowering formerly complaisant consumers to control what is popular. Anderson gives examples of musicians who made it big without record label support and were able to \\"record and distribute their music themselves and keep their creative independence\\" (p. 106) and actors who developed enormous fan bases and reached stardom by posting their skits online. By citing such examples, Anderson illustrates to readers that aspiring artists no longer need to wait for a big break from entertainment industry executives; \\"technology has shifted the balance of power from label to band\\" (p. 106). Anderson also uses a real-world example to show readers that when a company broadens its selection of items it will learn from the customer what is popular: \\"Until KitchenAid had an online channel that allowed customers to pick from its full range of products, it had no way of knowing that there was latent consumer demand [for orange mixers] that it hadn't previously tapped\\" (p. 205).<br /><br />The author's real-world proof that consumers can influence industries leads readers to evaluate their own position in corporate-to-consumer relationships. The Long Tail model causes readers to think twice about supporting broad-appeal-based businesses that offer limited selections. Readers may ask: Why should I settle for mainstream when I can get just what I want elsewhere? Both consumers and producers can leverage the Long Tail of niche markets to their own advantage. Anderson notes that while abundance of selection grants consumers the power of choice, businesses are reaping the revenue benefits of the Tail: \\"the numbers are so large that you can lop off a large chunk (the hits) and it's still a huge market\\" (p. 215).<br /><br />Anderson does a good job of reminding the reader of the context from which the Long Tail should be viewed; it is one splice of a larger market. He appropriately notes that while there is a significant subculture market to be captured in the Long Tail, the head of hits should not be disregarded. It is hard to side with writers such as Anita Elberse of the Harvard Business Review who seem to misconstrue the Long Tail concept as promoting tail-only business; Anderson explicitly states that \\"successful Long Tail aggregators need to have both hits and niches\\" (p. 148). He cites the importance of both ends, using Google as an example: \\"most of its revenues come from the head of the curve, [but] most of its customers are somewhere in the tail, which suggests that this is where much of its growth will come in the future\\" (p. 215).<br /><br />While the educational and thought-provoking merits of The Long Tail are significant, Anderson nonetheless introduces two challenges to his readers. The first challenge lies in the mid-section of the book, wherein Anderson is unnecessarily redundant and risks losing the reader's attention. Page 146 would make an excellent last page, as it nicely summarizes and connects what has been read. Although there is some good content interspersed in the redundancy, Chapter 9 (page 147) would make a nice start for The Long Tail: Part Two, as it restates what was in Part I. Page 155 revisits big box retailers, page 164 tells the reader again that there are limitations in airwaves, and goes on to recount what makes a hit. Ironically, in his WIRED Magazine article, \\"Free! Why $0.00 is the Future of Business,\\" Anderson states that in a world of abundance attention is the new scarcity to be vied for. A more concise, well-organized edition of the book would be more apt to engage the scarcity of attention.<br /><br />The second challenge is that the book lacks a genre. Anderson admits \\"I tremble to think where the Dewey Decimal System will place the book you're reading now. Technology? Economics? Business? Culture? None of them are quite right by themselves\\" (p. 161). For the reader, not knowing what The Long Tail was written for hinders enjoyment and slows the reading process. It is challenging to decipher if the book is meant to be read as a textbook from which statistics ought to be memorized, or as a breezy read that offers ideas that will be fun to share at cocktail parties. Anderson finds single-genre classifications to be limiting, since \\"one thing can be many different things to many different people\\" (p. 161). However, he overlooks that a genre can be of more use than just determining where to physically or digitally store/categorize the book. Genres can also provide readers a useful context from which to read. The burden of figuring out the genre of The Long Tail is a hurdle for the reader.<br /><br />As Professor Kathy Gill of the University of Washington notes, this is the \\"Wild West\\" of the digital age. In this Wild West, Anderson pulls together the elements and implications of a previously unattainable Long Tail market to bring meaning to this burgeoning area that is still being defined. Despite a few points of contention, The Long Tail does an excellent job of introducing and addressing today's changing economy and leads readers to evaluate the economic role they play.ch of its growth will come in the future\\" (p. 215).    While the educational and thought-provoking merits of The Long Tail are significant, Anderson nonetheless introduces two challenges to his readers. The first challenge lies in the mid-section of the book, wherein Anderson is unnecessarily redundant and risks losing the reader's attention. Page 146 would make an excellent last page, as it nicely summarizes and connects what has been read. Although there is some good content interspersed in the redundancy, Chapter 9 (page 147) would make a nice start for The Long Tail: Part Two, as it restates what was in Part I. Page 155 revisits big box retailers, page 164 tells the reader again that there are limitations in airwaves, and goes on to recount what makes a hit. Ironically, in his WIRED Magazine article, \\"Free! Why $0.00 is the Future of Business,\\" Anderson states that in a world of abundance attention is the new scarcity to be vied for. A more concise, well-organized edition of the book would be more apt to engage the scarcity of attention.     The second challenge is that the book lacks a genre. Anderson admits \\"I tremble to think where the Dewey Decimal System will place the book you're reading now. Technology? Economics? Business? Culture? None of them are quite right by themselves\\" (p. 161). For the reader, not knowing what The Long Tail was written for hinders enjoyment and slows the reading process. It is challenging to decipher if the book is meant to be read as a textbook from which statistics ought to be memorized, or as a breezy read that offers ideas that will be fun to share at cocktail parties. Anderson finds single-genre classifications to be limiting, since \\"one thing can be many different things to many different people\\" (p. 161). However, he overlooks that a genre can be of more use than just determining where to physically or digitally store/categorize the book. Genres can also provide readers a useful context from which to read. The burden of figuring out the genre of The Long Tail is a hurdle for the reader.      As Professor Kathy Gill of the University of Washington notes, this is the \\"Wild West\\" of the digital age. In this Wild West, Anderson pulls together the elements and implications of a previously unattainable Long Tail market to bring meaning to this burgeoning area that is still being defined. Despite a few points of contention, The Long Tail does an excellent job of introducing and addressing today's changing economy and leads readers to evaluate the economic role they play.

B0010X745K|5.0|In the 1970s I saw a book on the shelf at the local drugstore. It had a fascinating black cover, embossed with the face of a child with fangs. I asked my mother to purchase it, and that evening started reading Stephen King's [[ASIN:B000OJKT3K SALEM'S LOT]]. I was soon consuming each King book immediately after publication - \\"The Shining,\\" \\"The Dead Zone,\\" \\"The Stand.\\"    If nothing else, King was prolific (the man loves to write). I fell behind his massive publications, branching off to new authors and genres, some inspired by King's fine nonfiction work [[ASIN:0425104338 Stephen King's Danse Macabre]]. Somewhere along the way, King wrote the novella \\"The Mist,\\" which director Frank Darabont made into a film this past year. Television previews were horrible, resembling a low-budget variation of John Carpenter's near-classic horror tale [[ASIN:B000AM6OQ2 The Fog (Special Edition)]] (1980), which had a notoriously poor remake itself in 2005.     I have been beaten down over the years by increasingly degenerate horror films, breeding a level of cynicism for the genre I love. I felt exploited by the remakes of \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"The Hills Have Eyes. \\"Saw\\" was unusually offensive. Each film spawned sequels of decreasing quality.     I picked up the DVD case to \\"The Mist\\" at the rental store. I was surprised it was directed by Darabont, whose [[ASIN:B000P0J0EW The Shawshank Redemption (Single Disc Edition)]] and \\"The Green Mile\\" were respectable, if not extraordinary, works. He was a talent with an established track record, unusual for today's horror offerings. Sold by his name (rather than King's), I rented the film with the hope of quality and cheap thrills.     Much to my shock, I discovered one of the great horror films of the modern era, complete with crisp dialogue, tense atmosphere and earnest peformances by recognizable character actors. Arguably, it's one of the great monster movies of all time, with the horror deriving from human characters turning on one another as the apocalyptic tension increases.    Several aspects of \\"The Mist\\" will remind viewers of Alfred Hitchcock's [[ASIN:0783240236 The Birds (Collector's Edition)]] (1963) and George Romero's [[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)]] (1968), or for those versed in \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" the 1960 episode \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street.\\" You have characters from different cultural backgrounds thrown together against an unknown menace. Birds, zombies or slithering creatures, no matter, the fascination of these films is how humans react to having their worlds permanently changed within a matter of minutes.    I suppose the key to any monster film is the monster. Steven Spielberg's [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)]] (1975) set a standard by not showing the creature until more than one hour into the film. [[ASIN:B0000694WH Curse of the Demon / Night of the Demon]] (1957) had the audacity to not reveal the monster until the final scene. But this is the modern world, and Darabont is forced to reveal pieces of his creatures as \\"The Mist\\" progresses. When they do make an appearance, they are not creatures we have seen before. They fly, bite, swarm and slither. Some are big. Once the monsters are shown, specifically one evening as they crash into the store windows, the suspense remains. Like cockroaches, these creatures move too fast for comfort, and so dangerous that there is little hope.    Following an especially violent thunderstorm, a mist pours into a small Maine town and a father and son find themselves trapped with 30-40 people at the local grocery store. Preceded by the terrifying wail of an emergency siren, the fog surrounds the store as a resident, covered in blood, rushes past the glass doors announcing \\"There's something in the mist!\\" Cell phones stop working, the electricity goes out and the trapped survivors, noshing on the store's potato chips and sports drinks, stare at the mist in frozen silence.Thomas Jane plays the father David Drayton, a local artist hunk who attempts to keep the residents calm while caring for his terrified son. Drayton's not a native, plus he's fairly well-to-do, and as the hours grind on he uncomfortably realizes that the locals are rallying around Bible-thumper Mrs. Carmody (Oscar-winner Marcia Gay Harden, in grand saliva-spitting form). In Jim Jones tradition, she announces the apocalypse, and the need to appease the Gods with sacrifice. Drayton's son is blonde and innocent and, well, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out who might be the first offering.    Over the course of an agonizing hour, characters are established, tentacles slither through a loading dock, and an especially brave Hells Angels-type volunteers to walk into the mist with a rope around his waist. While I will not reveal his outcome, the screams of the store's inhabitants are traumatic and real. Multiple times I found myself imagining what I would do if trapped in the same situation. The brilliance of \\"The Mist,\\" and I believe this was intentional strategy by Darabont (who also wrote the screenplay), is the choices made were exactly what I considered.    There's multiple American analogies one can apply to \\"The Mist,\\" as it dabbles in race and religious prejudices and lynch mob mentality. The Lovecraftian creepy crawlies throw everyone into a state of rabid panic and there's a genuine feeling of doom pervading the drama as it takes on [[ASIN:0399529209 Lord of the Flies (50th Anniversary Edition)]] dynamics.    As the final action unfolds, Drayton is forced to make a unimaginably difficult decision. Viewers will find themselves wondering if they could have committed the same act, a choice that will provoke conversation long after the haunting final credits.    Mr. King's imagination has once again captured mine, and I've been reminded of an old, childhood friend, as comfortable as a black and white Rod Serling. Welcome back Mr. King, and thank you Mr. Darabont for having the bravery to fulfill a thoughtfully nightmarish vision.

But it is how we all are..     *SPOILER* If Bella and Edward wouldn't have had their happily ever after even MORE people would be complaining. Why can't we just enjoy the book the way it is?

B000002HAJ|5.0|In 1992 I was reading Guitar Player and there was an article on the Cure. I always thought they were some weird goth band but I read the interview with an open mind and was surprised to find that not only did they favour writing with guitars but they (mostly Robert) had a huge vintage collection. Remember Porl went onto the Page/Plant tour? Well in the article it satates that at rehearsals and sound checks they would jam on Zep tunes before Robert would arrive. It was agreat interview and I was impressed with their wit and charm. I went out and bought both Wish and Mixed Up. Robert's writing, recording, and production techniques both won me over and inspired my own recording ventures. If you are a song writer or guitar player then you owe it to yourself to discover the Cure. They use a lot of small parts to paint a very large picture. Cheers.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|\\"The Half Blood Prince\\" should be called \\"The Half Cocked Film.\\" Books aside, the film leaps, jumps and bounces about from darkness to glee in artistic, engaging and dramatically potent form, but in the end may leave the viewer scratching their heads.<br /><br />Fans of the books KNOW what's going on, moviegoers may be a bit confused as the why things happen. For one, the film opens with Ginny and Harry madly in unspoken love as Ginny snogs Dean Thomas anyway, and Hermione is suddenly infatuated with Ron - sure, there has been tension between hem since puberty, but jealousy seems a bit of a stretch all of a sudden (in the books it's more of a slow brewing issue.)<br /><br />Without too many spoilers, ask yourself: how and why does Harry know what and for what use a Beazor is and why does his potions master (not Snape now) sit and watch a student die when the solution should be clear to him? Why is there no defenses at the Weasely house if they are in dire danger, why no Order members standing guard, no spells around the property and why do the Death Eaters attack? (hint, it's not in the book at all!!! so there's no answer.) Why does Dumbledore take Harry to the Burrow at the beginning of the film (it makes sense in the book, here, no reason.) Why does Harry take orders from Snape at the end without question? Why does no one challenge four Death Eaters running amok in Hogwarts and setting Hagrid's hut ablaze?<br /><br />The movie is fast, humorous, entertaining and a wonder to watch, both emotionally and visually. I buy the characters, the motivations, the special effects, everything almost... just not the logical flaws that made me scratch my head all the way home.<br /><br /> I do hope they shot a lot of scenes that will someday make up an extended DVD /  Blu-Ray version. The film is so close to being the perfect Potter film, but forgets the audience isn't stupid.
B00005JPY0|2.0|I guess I was looking for a little bit more.  I was led to believe that, at some point in the 3 hours, Batman and The Joker would have a brief but interesting exchange about being two sides of the same coin--the nature of good and evil thing.

(See the movie Heat, where arch-villain DeNiro has coffee with good-guy cop Pacino, and the idea is, they're both professionals who shoot people...very interesting).<br /><br />Ok, so nothing that \\"deep\\".

B000WGWQG8|4.0|HBO's special miniseries and projects have been the gold standard in quality television productions in the last decade.  They have delivered many popular portrayals of American history, such as the notable mid-90s TV movie with Gary Sinise as Harry Truman, and the recent FDR bio \\"Warm Springs\\".  The former work made use of David McCullough's excellent biography, and now comes \\"John Adams\\", following McCullough's book the same.  The result is a quality production overall, though it is a bit slow in places.    Adams was a major player in the American Revolution, and his contribution is deservedly celebrated here, though his life presents some challenges to filmmakers; in particular, he was not really a presence in the field (so no big battle scenes or such moments of martial heroics), so the main drag comes after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when Adams is shuffled off to the Continent to impotently lobby for aid from Europe.    The basic outline of the story begins in Boston in 1774, when lawyer John Adams is recruited by the British to defend the soldiers under arrest for the famous Boston Massacre, when protestors were gunned down.  The question is whether their captain gave the order to fire.  This first episode plays out like a legal drama; in episode two, the scene shifts to Philadelphia, and we get a new rendition of the familiar scenes of the Declaration being argued-over and drafted, and meet figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  Episode three, the weakest of the seven in my opinion, sees Adams in Frnace, doing little of consequence and bemoaning his separation from his beloved wife Abigail.  Adams his little talent for diplomacy or the foreign French court, and he often finds himself getting in the way of the more skilled Franklin.  Upon his return to the United States in the final episodes, he must deal with the maddeningly inconsequential role of the Vice President, the rivalry between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton,his troubled presidency (with the focus being on the prospect of war with France), family squabbles (most of all his drunken failure of son, Charles), and, finally, his physical decline in retirement.    The title role is essayed by Pail Giamatti, who is a rather interesting choice for the main character in a 19th century drama; he is not the sort of heroic type one might expect.  This is suited to the Adams of the story, who is, for all his positive qualities, frequently petty and short-sighted, given to bursts of anger.  His wife Abigail is played by Laura Linney, who sometimes skirts too close to being a stereotypical Supportive Wife, but other times is accorded more in the way of emotion and personality variance (and Linney is a great actress).  Other performances of note are Stephen Dillane as Jefferson and a drole Tom Wilson as Benjamin Franklin.    Given that the story pans from 1774 to 1826, the actors require extensive use of age makeup, and the stuff used here is very good.  Giamatti, in particular, spends the last few episodes as an extremely believable elderly Adams.  Being HBO, the series makes a point of giving as 'realistic' a setting as possible, rather than the spotless look of movies like \\"1776\\".  Bad teeth abound as Adams grows older.  The series begins and ends with two especially memorable moments of period gruesomeness: the first, a grisly tarring-and-feathering of a British loyalist, the second a wince-inducing depiction of a 19th century mastectomy.    There is a rather bizarre scene where Adams rants about historical inaccuracies in the depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which seems out of place, given that this miniseries takes liberties with history as the average production does (right down the Adams' rant itself, ironically, which he did not give).  It's hard to know what to make of that moment.    Regardless, this is overall a very interesting piece of work.
B001ADW4UU|5.0|Though I was never really an ABBA fan, I certainly knew who they were and I knew a few of their songs (\\"Dancing Queen\\", \\"Mamma Mia!\\", etc.) I knew when MAMMA MIA! hit the stage that it was based on the songs of ABBA but never saw it.<br /><br />When I saw the movie trailer, though, I thought: This is going to be good.

And it's WONDERFUL.<br /><br />I usually have a preference for soundtracks of musicals over Broadway cast recordings, for one reason: The voices aren't always as good, but the orchestrations are usually much richer and fuller (ex: PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, which had a 50-piece orchestra for the show, had a 100-piece orchestra on the soundtrack -- yeah, it DOES make a difference!)<br /><br />Here the orchestrations stuck close to the ABBA originals, but with, of course, far more voices on the choral numbers.

B000XVT7SW|5.0|Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci are often called the heavenly twins, but I don't think that's quite true. I'm not sure if Cavalleria is a great opera, but it's certainly a very good one. True, Mascagni does an admirable job of creating a small town atmosphere where privacy is a rare luxury and religion supersedes almost everything, you can practically feel every cobblestone, every whiff of ocean breeze, every drop of holy water in the music, and the score is filled with beautiful, passionate, dazzling melodies. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the opera never exceeds the sum of its parts. Maybe it's because the opera is ALL about flooding the listener with beautiful, passionate, dazzling music, and this comes at the expense of character development and true drama. It's a shame that Mascagni's masterpiece Iris is so seldom performed, and isn't available on DVD. Still, as I said before, Cavalleria Rusticana is quite good. Pagliacci, on the other hand, is a true masterpiece, one of the great treasures of the operatic repertoire. The opera, with its melodic richness, its orchestral inventiveness, and its solid musical characterizations, manages to transcend the tawdriness of the characters, who spend almost the entire opera hurting one another, to the extent that it qualifies as high art. It may well be the greatest short opera ever written.    This DVD presents a pair of films produced in 1968, featuring stellar casts and conducted by Herbert von Karajan, who also directs the film of Pagliacci. The films, like the operas, are good(Cavalleria) and phenomenal(Pagliacci).    The Cavalleria film faces the same central problem as any film of this opera: What to do with all that time devoted to long instrumental passages? Ake Falck, who directs the film, treats these moments like scenes from a movie by Yasujiro Ozu, filling them with shot after static shot of meaningful scenery, from rustic streets to a beautiful and tempestuous shoreline to a towering crucifix. This establishes atmosphere, like the opera the film does a good job of evoking a specific time and place, but it soon grows tiresome, leaving the viewer to concentrate on Mascagni's lovely music, which isn't such a bad thing. The rest of the film is pretty straightforward, like the opera itself, as primitive as the brutal emotions it conveys, with no abstraction whatsoever, no symbolism. The performers carry the film: Fiorenza Cossotto as Santuzza, sympathetic rather than shrewish; Gianfranco Cecchele as Turridu, fiery and handsome(he looks like a cross between Franco Corelli and Roberto Alagna); and Giangiacomo Guelfi as Alfio, the minatory cuckold. This is a fine performance overall, with von Karajan and his orchestra finding just the right moments to elevate the music to a passionate crescendo while easing up and luxuriating in the more passive moments. The film is unspectacular, but it serves as a competent enough overture for the fireworks to come in round two.    With this Pagliacci, von Karajan has produced a fine example of opera on film, his visual technique matching the color, the choreography, the brutal honesty suggested by the music. His use of close-ups illustrates a true affinity for this medium, as does his ability to coax just the right facial expressions from his performers. Speaking of which, the players are ideal. John Vickers has the perfect voice for Canio, with his ability to sing so beautifully but also with venom. Few can match his technique, or his intensity. He percolates with menace almost from the moment he appears onscreen. He is matched in both the singing and acting departments by Raina Kabaivanska, one of von Karajan's favorite sopranos, young and heartbreakingly beautiful here, cold but also passionate, with  both the graceful movements and supple voice of a bird in flight. The way she flits so effortlessly onstage during the play within a play makes me wonder if she was a ballerina in a previous life. It's easy to see why a passionate sortwith a raging temper might kill for her. Peter Glossop delivers a knockout prologue, and his Tonio eschews any opportunity for sympathy based on the character's deformity, he plays the hunchback as someone who would be every bit as grotesque even in a perfect body, unashamedly off-putting, mean-spirited and soulless, like the other major players in this fine but unsettling drama. Once again, von Karajan and his forces deliver the goods, driving the music forward with all the ardor and madness of the story's characters.    This isn't the only DVD to feature a pair of films of these two operas. The other, also on Deutsche Grammophon, offers the filmmaking talents of Franco Zefferelli, the conducting talents of Georges Pretre, and the vocal talents of Placido Domingo. It, too, is a marvelous DVD, but I give the edge to this one, primarily for its Pagliacci which is nearly perfect.    Instead of twins, perhaps it is better to look at these two operas as siblings, Cavalleria the sturdy and unassertive one that never quite achieves an individuality of voice, impeccable to be sure when viewed on its own, but overshadowed to a degree when presented side by side with its outlandishly talented brother or sister. Or we could dispense with all this pretentious nonsense and simply say, here we have two operas, one good, one great. Enjoy.
0316168815|5.0|I just finished The Lovely Bones, and then I cried for an hour.  Now my face is poofy.<br /><br />The book is, of course, sad.  However, it also has a beautiful image of heaven and a wonderful story of a family that ends up healed and whole after the death of their daughter.  I was comforted by the way Susie could look down on her family and be near them, even make herself known to them a time or two.  In the beginning, Susie spends time thinking of all the things she will never get to do, which of course was terribly hard for me to read, but the worst of it?  The absolute worst part was reading about her individual family members as they broke up under the pressure of their own grief.  That was what had me crying on the bus.  Honestly though, the book was wonderful.  It's just something that some of us will have to read alone, in the dark, with wine.<br /><br />Verdict: A
015206396X|5.0|I don't know how to say it better; this book was fantastic!  It was easy to cheer on the main characters.  The development of the graces (highly developed inborn talents) throughout the book was interesting.  I won't say that I stayed up all night reading it since I have a demanding two year old to deal with in the morning, but I did burn through it in a couple of days.    The plot was well planned, though at some point I began worrying that the book would be number one of a trilogy and that it would take years to know the outcome.  Rest assured, the author wrapped it up neatly, and left enought that there's definitely a chance for more if the book is a hit.    I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy novels.  I'm definitely watching for more from Kristin Cashore in the future!

I won't recount the plot for you because plenty have already, but this miniseries is of great quality, splendid acting, and the story line is perfect for lovers of Jane Austin and BBC.

B0000D8HDF|5.0|Having heard the orchestral versions of Beethoven's symphonies many times before, I was intrigued when my friend recommended that I check out this recording of the Liszt piano transcriptions.    Needless to say, I was amazed by the performance (particularly the Pastorale, No.6).  The sound is so full at times, that I completely forgot that it is being produced by a single piano (and a single person).  I am hypnotized by these recordings and have listened to them for countless hours since.    I heard that it took Katsaris many years to polish and record all of these transcriptions, and his dedication and hard work has paid off tremendously with this heavenly recording.     Very highly recommended.

B000002B7M|5.0|Former Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne released his first solo album entitled Blizzard Of Ozz in the United Kingdom in late 1980 and here in the United States in the Spring of 1981.<br />After being dismissed from Black Sabbath in 1979, Ozzy continued to spiral out of control until he was saved by a lady named Sharon Arden (who was the daughter of Black Sabbath's then-manager Don Arden (and eventually became Ozzy's often controversial manager and later wife)). She and Ozzy put together a band that included ex-Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake, ex-Rainbow and Uriah Heep bass player Bob Daisley and a then-22 year old guitar virtuoso Randy Rhoads from Los Angeles, California all came into his life and helped his launch a solo career that would be big and yes NOTORIOUS!<br />We begin with a backwards gong effect before the sure fire riff of \\"I Don't Know\\". This is straight-up metal which featured some of the Ozzman's most memorable singing and Bob Daisley's killer lyrics. It's not at all surprising to find that this one still gets played on the radio on a very regular basis. Nice opener. Next is \\"Crazy Train\\" which is arguably Ozzy's most famous solo song ever, and once you listen to it, it really isn't that hard to see why. From Ozzy's maniacal echo-plexed opening laugh and vibra-slap to Randy's killer riff and superb vocals, I can see why this song is a classic in the rock and roll world. Next is the Ozzman's first attempt at a ballad called \\"Goodbye To Romance\\". This is one of my favorite tracks and Ozzy's vocals plus Randy's melodic rhytm playing and middle solo is amongst his best. Also, Don Airey's ending synthesizer solo sounds triumphant. The instrumental \\"Dee\\" is next and is basically a Randy Rhoads classical guitar solo and showing why he was one of rock's greatest guitarists. Next is the first half closing and possibly Ozzy's most controversial song ever \\"Suicide Solution\\". Supposedly, Ozzy whote the song as a hidden message for fans to commit suicide. In fact, it was written in tribute to Ozzy's fallen friend, Bon Scott of AC/DC, who died in February of 1980. The song supposedly contained subliminal messages of \\"get the gun, get the gun\\" and \\"shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot\\". It was acutually vocal phrasings. This song is a killer rocker with a powerful Rhoads riff and stellar playing from messieurs Kerslake and Daisley.<br />The album's second half starts with \\"Mr. Crowley\\" which is a classic metal tale about the legendary satanist Aleister Crowley and became a radio staple in later years and a favorite album track. From Don Airey's awesome opening organ-style synthesizer solo right down to Randy Rhoads' guitar solos at the end, this song ROCKS. Next is \\"No Bone Movies\\" which is a basic hard rocker from Ozzy. I have no complaints with this song whatsoever, in that I feel it is an excellent song. Also, hearing Randy perform a rare slide guitar solo was excellent. The epic \\"Revelation  (Mother Earth)\\" follows and is both eerie and melodic at the same time. This song is my favorite on the album and may be a slower track, but its eerie nature and subject matter and ending solo section from Rhoads and Daisley and Kerslake keep it from being what you could call a ballad. The song, in some places musically, is reminiscent of \\"She's Gone\\", a song Ozzy recorded with Black Sabbath in 1976 on their Technical Ecstasy album. We then rock out with Blizzard's closing track the rocking \\"Steal Away (The Night)\\". This track rocks and rules!<br />Blizzard of Ozz was also a huge success commercially becoming Ozzy's first Gold album (eventually Quadruple Platinum selling album) in the US within days of its release after a controversial incident with his record label involving the biting off of the head of a live bird at the CBS Records offices but the music is why this album is timeless.<br />This original version, nor the superb 1995 Bob Ludwig remaster (this issue I am reviewing) of BoO is no longer available after a spat between Sharon and ex-Ozzy members Daisley and Kerslake over owed royalties caused Sharon to re-record all of BoO's backing tracks.<br />This original issue of Blizzard is RECOMMENDED!embers Daisley and Kerslake over owed royalties caused Sharon to re-record all of BoO's backing tracks.   This original issue of Blizzard is RECOMMENDED!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|This is a wonderful of Santana's best songs.  They are all different and fun to listen to. Great for playing at parties or just jamming in your car on the way to work or on a trip.
B000002B7O|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's second solo album Diary of a Madman was released in November of 1981.<br />When Ozzy Osbourne released his first album after his Black Sabbath ouster called Blizzard Of Ozz (which included a stellar band including bass player Bob Daisley, drummer Lee Kerslake and the late great guitarist Randy Rhoads), he proved he could survive without Sabbath with great success.<br />In early 1981, Ozzy (plus Rhoads, Kerslake and Daisley) re-entered the recording studio to record his second solo album and pressure was on to deliver an album that was either as good as his debut or better. Would Ozzy and company deliver or would they be written off. Read ahead and find out (as I did when I first acquired the cassette in March of 1984 on recommendation after liking Bark at the Moon so much as a just turned 8 year old).<br />We kick things off with one of Ozzy's best rockers \\"Over the Mountain\\" which had one of the best rock drumming intros and a great solo work from Rhoads. Next was the album's rock radio staple \\"Flying High Again\\" which is a great number. Next is the other rock radio staple and the truth about rock music in general \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\". This near seven minute epic is about Ozzy's true love (Rock and Roll). Randy Rhoads' guitar work here was unreal. The first side closed with a great rocker out of \\"Believer\\". Great musicianship and vocal work from Ozzy.<br />The album's second half kicks off with \\"Little Dolls\\" which had another stellar Kerslake drum intro which went into a great rocker. Next is another ballad \\"Tonight\\" which slows things down a bit but still a stellar song. We follow with the rocker \\"S.A.T.O.\\" and is another winner. We close with the epic haunting title cut which featured some of Rhoads' best guitar work and superb musicianship from Kerslake and Daisley plus haunting choir and strings.<br />Diary of a Madman was yet another Top 20 smash for The Ozzman and his first Platinum seller in the US (now at four million in US sales).<br />This album was sadly the last with Ozzy's first (and best) solo band as Messieurs Kerslake and Daisley were fired upon the album's completion and sadly Randy Rhoads whom would tragically die in a plane crash in March of 1982 whilst touring with Ozzy en route to a show in Orlando, Fla (to play a show with Foreigner).<br />If you buy this album, make sure you buy the 1980s CD issue or the 1995 remaster (with green border on cover as this review is for) superbly remastered by Bob Ludwig and do not, I REPEAT DO NOT, buy the atrocitious 2002 re-issues which saw Sharon spitefully and coldly delete Daisley and Kerslake's parts and replace them with Robert Trujillo (now Metallica's bass player) and current Ozzy and ex-Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin who slaughtered this masterpiece because she would not pay Daisley and Kerslake their owed royalties for their hard work on the album.dly the last with Ozzy's first (and best) solo band as Messieurs Kerslake and Daisley were fired upon the album's completion and sadly Randy Rhoads whom would tragically die in a plane crash in March of 1982 whilst touring with Ozzy en route to a show in Orlando, Fla (to play a show with Foreigner).

Knowing only a minimal amount about the history of this time period I knew that they took a lot of liberties and hollywood-ized it but I found it to be very entertaining and engaging.  The actors are all amazing and they drew me in to the stories.  I can't wait for the second season.
B000002JSR|5.0|Led Zeppelin's odds and ends album Coda was released in November of 1982.<br />How this album came to be, let's set the stage shall we.<br />In 1980, Led Zeppelin were riding high on the success of In Through the Out Door which was on its way to selling 7 million copies in the US alone (not bad for Zep standards and outsold Led Zeppelin 3 and Presence). The band toured Europe and were selling out venues nightly but then tragedy struck, drummer John Bonham passed away on September 25, 1980 as the band was rehearsing for a US tour. Over two months later, the band broke up after the death of Bonham whose style was hard to replicate and deemed him irreplaceable.<br />Throughout 1981 and 1982, guitarist Jimmy Page worked on the soundtrack to Death Wish II and Robert Plant released his solo debut Pictures at Eleven (which hit #3 in the US) whilst bass player John Paul Jones went into soundtrack work. Also, Page went through the Zep vaults to cobble together a final Led Zeppelin album which would be called Coda.<br />The recordings were from between 1970 and 1978 with some fresh overdubs by Plant and Page where required as followed.<br />We open with the rocker \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" which is the same version as it would appear on the 2003 Led Zeppelin DVD and recorded at The Royal Albert Hall in January, 1970 (not Morgan Studios like the notes stated). It's the same version as on the DVD but Page overdubbed guitar solos in 1982 to fill out the song (the overdubs were removed on the DVD version) and Plant's voice went through a phaser (unlike the version on the Led Zeppelin DVD). Next is \\"Poor Tom\\" which is a great countryish outtake from Led Zeppelin III. The song has Page playing acoustic guitar over a classic Bonzo drum pattern with Jonesy filling out the bass and Plant singing and playing harmonica. Next is \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" which is the same song as on Led Zeppelin I, but on steroids. Harder drumming and more furious guitar and singing than on the original. It has a very raw feel to it. This track is also on the Zep DVD from Royal Albert Hall but shortened for vinyl constraints (and not a rehearsal like the liner notes state). The first half ends with the Houses of the Holy outtake \\"Walter's Walk\\". This rocker just rocks and would have appeared on Houses save time constraints and there were no lyrics so Plant recorded the vocals in 1981/82 with fresh lyrics.<br />The album's second half consists of the outtakes from In Through the Out Door except as noted. The rocker \\"Ozone Baby\\" is from the ITtOD sessions and was one of the rock radio hits from the album. \\"Darlene\\" is next and is one of the album's best tracks and the biggest rock radio hit from the album. Another ITtOD outtake which just rocks. Next is \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\" which is a John Bonham drum workout that was recorded in Montreux in 1976. It just features Bonham and Page messing around in the studio one day and Page later added some electronic stuff to it. The closing \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" is Zeppelin's answer to the punk music movement that was popular in Europe at the time (it didn't get big in the US until years later) and is from the ITtOD sessions. It has a very fast-paced beat and is a killer rocker.<br />Coda, when released, quickly stormed to #4 on the Billboard album chart and went Platinum quick but by then Men at Work, Michael Jackson, A Flock of Seagulls and later Duran Duran were all dominating the US music scene.<br />In 1993, this album was re-issued on The Complete Studio Recordings box set (see review) with the four bonus tracks that appeared on Led Zeppelin's 1990 and 1993 box sets.<br />If you are an unbiased Zep fan (like myself), pick this up, if not your loss.<br />Recommended!l to it.

0765348276|4.0|It isn't going to change the world, or probably enlighten anyone, but this is a great piece of military sci-fi. This is a sort of modern Starship Troopers and the plot closely parallels it from enlistment, to boot camp,  to a milk run on a low-tech planet, to humans getting hit, to the human offensive.    The first half of the book is like bottled lightning. Ideas come fast and furious and you can't stop reading. Scalzi's universe provokes the so rare sense of wonder in the reader as they experience the rejuvenation of the soldiers and the giddy joy of having incredibly gifted physical prowess tempered by the danger of a war in which most will die before their 10 year enlistment is up.    The second half slows and is weakened a bit in my opinion by a particularly maudlin plot involving the ghost brigades. The ghost brigades themselves are another wonderful idea the relationship plot detracted from the story for me. I found both the coincidence of the meeting and the follow up to be unlikely.    One plus is that the aliens are truly alien. So different that in some cases there can be no realistic understanding between the two races, though to be fair there are characters with dissenting opinions on whether the human race can negotiate with these other races which range from understandable and allied, to 100% alien and enemy to totally inscrutable with a motivation above and beyond conquest but interested in the spiritual growth of other races.    The climax speeds back up to the fast pace of the beginning and resolves the plot threads, mostly, in a more than satisfactory fashion. This is a really wonderful universe that has been created with room for many more stories. I will definitely be seeking out Scalzi's other titles.

If you are familiar with televisions `Heros', you understand the premise of a graceling, only gracelings are easily identified by their eyes, which are two different colors.<br /><br />Katsa must learn to control her grace, and free herself of the hold her Uncle has over her and her own sense of self worth that he defines for her.  She does this through a series of adventures outside her own kingdom were she sees that other kingdoms citizens do not hold the same opinion of gracelings as her own and with the assistance of a fellow graceling, Po.<br /><br />By the end of the book, two of the seven kingdoms are blessed with good and fair leaders, leaving the other five kingdoms for sequels. I feel the adventures of Katsa and Po are far from over.<br /><br />If you enjoyed reading the series `The Clan and the Cave Bear' as a pre-teen/teen get this for your pre-teen/teen, it has the same magical qualities, and an equally strong heroine.
0316042994|5.0|This brief review has two purposes. First, to encourage readers to buy [[ASIN:0307269965 the cloth-bound edition]], which fits easily into the hand, has much cleaner printing than the paperback, and contains an excellent introduction by Sir Frank Kermode together with a helpful chronology, which puts Waugh into the context of contemporary writings and events. It is well worth the extra two dollars.<br /><br />My second purpose is to alert readers coming to the book after seeing the recent Miramax movie, that the two are likely to be quite different experiences. The film is magnificently set, splendidly acted, and passionately dramatic; it has all the Hollywood virtues. But it almost misses the fact that Waugh's purpose was as much spiritual as secular: to demonstrate, as he put it, \\"the operation of divine grace upon a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\" You could come away from the movie thinking it was an anti-Catholic tract -- but Waugh's novel, despite its characteristic comedy, is also a profound religious statement. I develop this point in more detail in my review of the cloth-bound edition, but whichever one you buy, I highly recommend this book.

0307386171|3.0|It seems as though each time you check his website, Ian McEwan has collected another award, and with the success of Atonement he has to be considered one of the great living novelists in English. Although On Chesil Beach (Nan A. Talese, 2007) lacks the scope of Atonement, it is clearly a product of the same artistic sensibility.<br /><br />The recent novel is set in 1962, on the eve (ironically) of the decade that brought fundamental changes in lifestyles, especially in regard to sexual mores. McEwan's young newly weds are both products of older times, virgins who have never spoken to one another about such things. Florence assumes that Edward has the required minimal sexual experience, and he assumes that she is eager for a sex life within the sacrament of marriage. Neither is correct. The central event of the novel is the wedding night in a hotel at Chesil Beach, where things come apart miserably as a result of his extreme performance anxiety and her irrepressible sexual loathing.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, McEwan shifts from one point of view to the other, allowing the reader to experience first hand each character's flawed perceptions of the other. The technique is especially effective after the failed wedding night, when they fabricate defensive cases against one another. Atonement and On Chesil Beach are both about communication and how its failure can alter a life. In the first novel, the failed communication was the telling of an untrue tale by a child who dreamed of being a storyteller. In the later novel, the sexual failure was the result of things left unsaid. Both novels end with glimpses of the future lives that resulted from the communication failures.<br /><br />On Chesile Beach is really a novella, stretched to book length with the use of small pages and a lot of white space. Personally, I think short is good, and this one is definitely vintage McEwan.

So I plodded through dozens and dozens of paragraph-length, miserable, syrupy descriptions of Edward's appearance and the \\"bottomless depth\\" of Bella's love. Ugh. It makes me queasy just thinking about it.  $55 and 6,000 pages later and i get Breaking Dawn???? A silly, badly paced, over-written, anti-climactic piece of garbage.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|After watching the Dark KNight, twice, I couldn't help but thinking 'why everybody is so crazy about the neew movie, isn't the Begins way better?'    I'm not here to criticize the Dark KNight, because it really is a great movie that has everything. Smart and sly evil character doing whatever he can to destroy people's lives, and the Batman struggling to keep up with his  selfcommitment to justice without people's fair recognition. What a Drama.    However after all, I should raise hand of the Batman Begins.  This movie answers every questions of batman lovers will ever have.  His origin, his philosophy, his characteristic, his agony, his struggle, his courage, his brilliance... in a very quasi-realistic way.  and most importantly, this movie answers WHY the Bruce Wayne is going through all those, sacrificing his reputation, personal relationships, and risking his life at all.    For just weekend moviegoer, Dark Knight must be a Great Movie.  but for True Batman Maniac like me, Begins is the mile stone that resurrected, personified, and liberated the Batman.
1416914293|5.0|Alright. So let me point this out to everyone: Yes, there is incest in this book. No, I don't mind it. Yes, there is homosexuality in this book. Again, I don't mind it.    For all of those people who are like: 'Omg! it's terrible because of what's going on with the characters!'Please, keep in mind that the author started out writing fanfiction. Incest and Homosexuality are seen in Fanfictions.Honestly though, I really like this book because it's so different then other books that I've read because the characters ARE so different. Really, I have never really read a book with a homosexual character, or have the main hero and heroine be in love yet are siblings. It's unique, in a mildly creepy way. I am a huge fan of the books, not only because the characters are often times witty and sarcastic, but because many of the aspects are unique.    I don't know how many times when I've read about 'orphan tries to find place in world, and saves the world!' books, or 'girl wants to break mold and runs off to join the army!', or 'destiny has chosen [characternamehere] to save the world!' type of books. The plot lines are over used, dull, and really repetitive. This book though totally broke the mold for me. And when I mean 'break the mold' I mean, seriously, breaking the mold.    I went onto about a two year reading hiatus (because no books really interested me) and I just picked up the first book in the series and could not put it down. It's not about a little orphan, or a princess running away from an arranged marriage. It is truly, truly an amazing book that I really do adore. I can't wait to see how the series ends honestly. The books, as far as I'm concerned, are very consistent so far.  It's not like the Twilight series, where the first one was just amazing, then drops off in quality after that, or really the Harry Potter series where it gets better and better. These books are amazing, and I really don't know how else she could improve them, so they're consistent in the whole 'amazing' factor.    There was only one thing that had a tendnecy of bugging me in the series. That was the author had a tendency of repeating about certain physical qualities in a character (simon's long eyelashes, Jace's hair, etc), that or else she sometimes goes out on tangents describing things that aren't really relevant to the plot. However, the book is filled with the same banter, same characters, and same character's personalities as the previous book. It's nice to see that the characters don't magically change with little, or no, background information as to why they changed between the two books (Granted, it helps that there's not long time gap between the books since the two of them take place only in a few days each).  -De

031606792X|5.0|I think some of her fans should seriously cut Stephenie some slack. She couldn't make everyone happy and I think the point of being a writer and an author is to first and foremost make yourself happy with the story that you are writing. I think people are being so over critical about this book. With the plot, the lack of explicit sex scenes and the grammar. Every series has to have an end, an end the author is happy with. The problem is, is people come to expect too much from these author's. They start reading a book thinking everything they want to happen is going to happen and when it doesn't they act like he/she let them down and it's so sad and depressing that people think like that. I mean obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but as far as returning books, burning them and just straight out bashing her...I think it's a little much, don't you agree?<br /><br />I love the series and I loved the ending. Sure, there were things I would have liked to see and times in the book that I thought, well how could that happen, like with Bella's pregnancy, but that's the whole point of fiction right?<br /><br />Anyways, loved the book and I will probably be reading it again soon. Keep up the good work Stephenie! We love and adore you no matter what!!!
0316143472|4.0|I found this book to be quite entertaining. David has a way with words, and quite a different perspective on life. The stories he tells in the book are quite humorous (not laugh out loud funny), and offer the reader some life lessons, and maybe a little insight as to what life is all about.
6304711891|4.0|This is a story of 2 men who come together from completely different backgrounds, where they meet in San Francisco - a city where anything's possible. Goodspeed, played by the ever lovable Nicholas Cage, is a doctor who knows a lot about chemicals - he's always talking about those chemicals, it's just his *thing*. His girlfriend is pregnant - and at the beginning of the film they plan to marry - but unforeseen circumstances bring him to the West Coast. Mason on the other hand, played by a stern and tough Sean Connery, is an old rugged man who is locked in his room reading books and philosophizing about life. \\"In another life,\\" Mason admits in one scene, \\"I wish I were a poet or a farmer.\\"    Against all likelihood, the men are united on a mission \\"to save a city\\", as one character puts it. After a number of transforming events, Goodspeed's intellectual prowess and his knowledge about chemicals uniquely compliments Mason's rougher edges. And despite Mason's shortcommings, he's very good at acting on instinct, a quality that Goodspeed lacks. It's an unlikely couple to say the least, but the 2 actors definitely have great chemistry.    They first meet in the streets of San Francisco in a dazzling scene that can only be described as riveting and heart-pounding. They roam through those streets as if they owned the city, and in their own particularly ways, they seem to wreak havoc wherever they go.     The plot begins to pick up when Goodspeed's job eventually takes him to a remote relatively isolated island off of the city's coast, where he is asked scour the island for those chemicals that he knows so much about, which are being used by some macho guys in their big rockets that they're flaunting at everyone. Despite being hesitant at first, Mason eventually decides to join Goodspeed on the island, where the two experience mishaps and mayhem wherever they go. Sparks and explosions light up as Goodspeed and Mason find out that they're not so different afterall. All the while, through a number of plot developments and twists, their excursions take them through underground hidden passageways and abandoned buildings and lighthouses, even SCUBA diving underwater - all in search of those chemicals that Goodspeed is so determined to find.    The screen lights up as they cross paths with other characters who have also situated themselves on the island - these include tourists, generals, and even a group of specially trained Marines.     There's a bittersweet happiness at the end, when the two characters must part. Mason needs to return to his life of annomity back in SF Bay where he also has an estranged daughter, while Goodspeed reunites with his fiance. Although nonetheless the guys have experienced intense life-changing events that will likely forever change their lives. Heart-thomping action, betrayal, loyalty, deceit, poetry, disguise, lots of action and lots of male-bonding, somehow they've all made it into this rather energetic film.
031606792X|4.0|This was a perfectly good ending to a perfectly lovely series. These people giving it 1 star are so overly critical. Yes, she does tie everthing up in a neat, happy bow. But, come on, what's wrong with that. Who doesn't like a happy ending. This book left me happy and satisfied in the end, and that's what I wanted to get out of it.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|I was initially against a continuation of the runaway hit HBO series, [[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)]] I felt that the season finale was perfection and any other stories to be told would only spoil it. Once the movie started though, I was drawn in and it felt great to see these \\"familiar\\" friends again: Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and Charlotte (Kristin Davis). Carrie and Mr. Big (Chris Noth) decide to tie the knot, and the movie revolves around how their relationship takes the next step. Meanwhile, Miranda and Steve are dealing with Miranda neglecting their relationship. Samantha has become an L.A. housewife and is none too happy about continually playing second-fiddle to Smith. Charlotte...well, she is just living a perfect life with adopted daughter and husband Harry. The movie continues the vision of the series: insightful, witty, and extremely well written. Jennifer Hudson has a nice supporting role as Carrie's personal assistant; she brings sass to her role and definitely leaves the door open for a possibility of a \\"next generation\\" of young hopeful women to hit New York City. My gripes? I felt that fashion played too much of a role; in the TV series, it was a nice semi-silent costar. In the movie, it was a little \\"in your face\\" and over the top. I also felt that Samantha's storyline seemed a little out of character and contrived; her supposed weight gain was minimal and for her to ever stay in the background for Smith just seemed out of step. Many original cast members returned for the movie, although some were absolutely wasted as they were relegated to non-speaking cameos. For some reason, Stanford & Anthony are now close friends (possibly even more), which is totally against how they were in the series. Obviously, much has happened in the years since we last saw them; it left a feeling that an explanation scene or two must be on the cutting room floor. Removal of some of the fashion stuff and putting back in more of the witty dialogue would have benefitted the movie greatly. Speaking of putting back in...yes, this version is an extended cut. Many scenes have been lengthened, and it definitely helps give the movie a more finished feel and explains much that I thought was missing in the theater. Extra fun is Carrie's fashion show in her apartment, where she tries on many of her 1980's bad outfits for the girls, who rate whether the outfits should be kept or tossed. In the extended cut, ALL the girls (including Charlotte's daughter Lily) join in the fun and try on the outfits. This is especially wonderful as SJP does not necessarily deserve the lion's share of credit for this successful series; it is definitely an ensemble cast. The restored Halloween scene of Harry as The Addams Family's Uncle Fester is not to be missed, either!<br /><br />Still, I saw it twice on the big screen - thoroughly entertained both times, and hoping for a follow-up!<br /><br />The picture on the blu-ray is wonderful, with one exception. Just like the promotional photos for the movie, the actress' eye area is WAAAAAY over photoshopped/CGI enhanced to the point that they look unnatural. This is especially the case for Sarah Jessica Parker. The CGI work is not done well, as it changes from shot to shot, and looks fake to begin with. The sound mix is fantastic too, especially with a system that takes advantage of it.<br /><br />Bonus features for Blu-ray version:<br />* Audio Commentary by director Michael Patrick King<br />* Additional Scenes restored to the actual movie as well as a separate section with deleted scenes that feature commentary by Michael Patrick King as to why they were cut.<br />* A Conversation with Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael Patrick King: a nice look at the movie with SJP and MPK, giving further insight into many of the choices made for the movie.<br />* The Fabulous Fashion of Sex And The City: Excellent featurette withPatricia Fields discussing how she finds all the different fashions for the character.

B00000DCHE|5.0|With three consecutive smash albums (\\"The Stranger,\\" \\"52nd Street,\\" and \\"Glass Houses,\\" Billy Joel had cemented himself as rock superstar. Capitalizing on this success, Billy spent most of 1980 on the road, where he played to packed stadiums and small clubs around the United States. With the tour a success, Billy decided to conjure up a live album from the tour. Howeve,r Billy took a decidedly different approach from the tour.<br /><br />Instead of overloading the album with stuff like \\"My Life,\\" \\"Piano Man,\\" and \\"It's Still Rock And Roll To Me,\\" Billy used this live album as a means of introducing his fans to his lesser known pre-\\"Stranger\\" material from albums such as \\"Cold Spring Harbor,\\" \\"Piano Man,\\" \\"Streetlife Serenader,\\" and \\"Turnstiles.\\"<br /><br />Not one of the songs present here was a Top 40 hit, and most weren't even singles. However, despite their relative unpopularity, they are very much welcomed by the crowds and hold the same energy and excitement as one of the megahits.<br /><br />The overwhelming majorty of the songs here are generally superior to the recorded versions, mainly due to the fact that Billy's band plays with a more intense and energetic fervor than the studio band used on the album. \\"Miami 2017,\\" \\"Los Angelenos,\\" and \\"Captain Jack\\" (the latter a tour de force for drummer Liberty De Vito) all have an extra bite not present on the studio version. Slower numbers like \\"Summer, Highland Falls,\\" \\"She's Got A Way\\" and \\"I've Lovedd These Days\\" are more passionate and introspective, while \\"Everybody Loves You Now\\" is more vitriolic and in your face.<br /><br />Billy's liner notes are incredible - humerous, honest and sincere. He recounts each song vivdly, and recollects memories of the tour in the same manner. I highly recommend this great album by a truly great artist.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|When I first heard \\"A-punk\\" on the radio I assumed that the rest of the album wouldn't be that great. Most of songs are really good, and even the couple that aren't great are still pretty good. I might get tired of it in awhile but it is a really fresh sounding CD that is a lot of fun in the mean time.
031606792X|5.0|If you are a fan of the Twilight series, you will not be disappointed.  No, this book was not realistic, but none of them were!  It had lots of unexpected twists and turns and also tied up the loose ends that needed to be tied up.  I still think more should be written, though!
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Prior to purchasing this Blu-ray DVD, I didn't know a thing about John Mayer. After watching this BD-DVD, I can honestly say I'm a fan. His performances in each of his three \\"incarnations\\" are outstanding and the video and audio quality are also excellent (mind you I'm accustomed to watching regular digital cable TV without HD).
0307386171|2.0|I have to give this \\"book-ette\\" two stars because it is very well written, but the story is truly dreadful and, in the end, uninteresting. This is my first McEwan book, and despite stellar reviews of his other works, I will have a difficult time trying them.

B000002GB2|4.0|This is considered to be Styx's transition album released shortly before Tommy Shaw arrived (JC plays on Equinox). It contains haunting reminders of The Serpent Is Rising, but with a slightly more straight ahead rock direction. Fortunately none of these songs were never really overplayed on the radio, therefore they have aged gracefully and have a refreshing sound. Favorite songs are Lorelei, Lonely Child, Midnight Ride, and the great classic Prelude 12 / Suite Madame Blue.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|Originally released in 1978 as \\"Day of the Woman\\" and re-released in 1980 with the more popular title (which writer/director Meir Zarchi hates),  \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" is a low-budget film telling a simple story of rape-and-revenge. Jennifer Hill, a magazine writer from New York City, rents a country house for the summer to write her first novel. Four low-lifes catch wind of her and brutally rape her, leaving her for dead. She survives, however, and executes revenge on each, using their weaknesses against them (pride, lust and lack of intelligence).<br /><br />The film is notorious. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel have railed against it over the years, giving it a zero star rating. Most theaters understandably refused to show it back in '78-'80. But it became a big hit on video in the early 80s and there's still quite a buzz about it 3 decades later. The film simply can't be stopped, as Zarchi points out. I've repeatedly heard about it over the years and finally decided to give it an artistic appraisal.<br /><br />Since I knew going in that this was a rape-revenge film with overt depictions I was fully braced for the material and therefore didn't find it shocking. Don't get me wrong, the rape scenes are fairly explicit and fittingly disturbing but, for me, it wasn't shocking because I knew what I was getting into. I suppose it would be quite shocking otherwise. Regardless, I feel \\"The Wild Angels,\\" which was released a full 12 years earlier, is more shocking. See my review for details.<br /><br />I should add here that, although the picture is explicit with the rape-revenge scenes, it's not pornographic. In other words, this is not a film to view for porn thrills. Sexually speaking, the rape/revenge scenes are a turn-off rather than a turn-on, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />After viewing the film I saw it again with writer/director Meir Zarchi's commentary (something I very rarely do). He has a heavy accent but I was able to adjust after about ten minutes. I highly encourage anyone viewing the film to hear this excellent commentary. Meir is brilliant and offers loads of important details. For instance, he shares what inspired him to make the movie. In 1974 he came across a beaten, naked young woman stumbling out of the woods; she had a broken jaw and had been raped by two scumbags. She said they would have killed her but she convinced them she couldn't see without her glasses and therefore couldn't identify them. They then broke her jaw to knock her unconscious so they could make a getaway. She regained consciousness fairly quickly and wisely decided to immediately get out of the area in case they changed their minds. She crawled through the woods to the nearest road, which is where Zarchi came across her.<br /><br />The film shows that the four rapists are misogynists who feel powerless in their daily lives and are threatened by an intelligent, talented woman from the city. Listen to their moronic dialogue during the night-fishing sequence. These guys talk about women like they're 13 years old (but worse), even though they're all in their late 20s. And, don't get me wrong, I KNOW there are adult men like this out there. It's pathetic.<br /><br />The picture reveals how actions can be incredibly misinterpreted by people with sick minds. For instance, the leader of the rapists comments that when Jennifer first came to town and stopped at his gas station she got out of the car and flaunted her beauty, her legs and breast. But the viewer sees differently. The truth is she just got out of the car to stretch her legs (in a modest dress, by the way) and make some friendly small talk while he pumped gas for her.<br /><br />The film also reveals what's in the hearts of people, including the viewer. For instance, when film critic Roger Ebert saw the film at a theater he overheard a middle-aged man make troubling comments during the rape sequences like, \\"That'll teach her\\" and \\"The others were good (the rapes) but this one's the best.\\" Ebert also heard a lady yell out during one of the revenge scenes, \\"Get him, sister!\\" (nothing wrong with that, of course).<br /><br />As for me, I was on the side of Jennier Hill the entire picture. This was obviously a very hard role to play and Camille Keaton did an incredible job; she even won a Best Actress award. Camille has a beautiful face and stunning locks of long auburn hair. But, at the time, she was way too thin for my tastes. She definitely needed to gain at least 20 pounds. Shortly after the film was released she married director Zarchi. Although the marriage didn't last, they remain good friends to this day.<br /><br />In any event, in the story Jennifer is a nice, beautiful, intelligent woman who just wants to get some time alone to enjoy nature and write her novel. She does absolutely nothing to provoke the abuse of the dirtbags.<br /><br />There's a church scene right before she enacts her revenge where she asks God for forgiveness. The real-life minister of the church caught wind of the nature of the film and contacted Zarchi, insisting that the parts depicting his church be taken out. Zarchi drove out to the church in Kent, Connecticut, where the film was made, and explained his reasons for making the picture. When the minister understood Zarchi's intentions he gave him his blessing.<br /><br />Speaking of the locations of the lush Kent area in Western Connecticut, this is one of the films highlights (I get sick of Southern California locations). In fact, believe it or not, it's one of the main items that prompted me to see the picture as I have personal interest in Western Connecticut.<br /><br />You'll see that the beauty of nature -- the sights and sounds of the forest -- are contrasted by the hideousness of human nature. This is effective.<br /><br />There's no score at all, even though Zarchi tried to fit music to it. He said it just didn't work; adding music diminished the impact. I agree.<br /><br />The film runs 100 minutes and it's all completely realistic until the 73-minute mark where Jennifer allows the mildly retarded rapist get close enough to her with a knife to easily kill her. She later allows the lead rapist the opportunity to get the upper hand (when she gives him the gun). I found this unbelievable. In both cases she could have easily killed the scumbags but instead momentarily makes herself vunerable to enact a more stylized revenge. I don't believe she would have done this in real life. But some would explain her actions on the grounds that she now no longer feared death (since she had been so close to it) and was willing to gamble with her life in order to punish the criminals in a way more fitting than a gunshot.<br /><br />Some may object to the idea of Jennifer having the strength to pull off the hanging, but Zarchi defends it by pointing out \\"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\"<br /><br />There are a couple other weak moments for which I detract 1 Star in my rating. In one close-up shot it's clear that the retarded guy's glasses are fake. Also, during the infamous bloodbath scene, wouldn't the guy realize he's been castrated right away (regardless of whether or not he's having an orgasm)? Dumb.<br /><br />Still, this is a powerful film, an important film and a necessary film. It counterbalances beauty with the hideousness of rape and supports the only just punishment for such extreme sins -- death. I should add that's it's not a movie to be watched in the presence of others. It's something you must experience alone, if at all.he revenge scenes, \\"Get him, sister!\\" (nothing wrong with that, of course).    As for me, I was on the side of Jennier Hill the entire picture.

In one close-up shot it's clear that the retarded guy's glasses are fake. Also, during the infamous bloodbath scene, wouldn't the guy realize he's been castrated right away (regardless of whether or not he's having an orgasm)? Dumb.     Still, this is a powerful film, an important film and a necessary film. It counterbalances beauty with the hideousness of rape and supports the only just punishment for such extreme sins -- death. I should add that's it's not a movie to be watched in the presence of others. It's something you must experience alone, if at all.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is a different album from their second one, with a sound that's slower, with more ballads than Under the Iron Sea.     Since I haven't paid exact attention to some tracks, I'll do a \\"key lyrics\\" type review - with my favorites on the album, which are quite a few.    Somewhere Only We Know - the single. This song is midtempo, but has emotional lyrics which can make an effect on you later in life. Great for those who like to \\"escape the world\\" and stay in a little hideout that \\"only you know\\".   Key lyric: \\"I walked across, a fallen tree, I felt the branches are they looking at me? Is this the place, we used to love, is this the place that we've been dreaming of?\\"    This is the Last Time - I didn't like this song before because it was a bit loud for me - but gradually I looked at the lyrics and it's my new favorite now! Great for those who let people \\"lean on them\\" mentally.  Key lyric: \\"The last time, you fall on me for anything you like.\\"    We Might As Well be Strangers - It isn't the lyrics that make this song, but the basslines and power balladry. Powered with a good subwoofer, the bass just POUNDS out. For those who are in a tough relationship crisis.  Key lyric: \\"I don't understand your heart - it's easier to be apart.\\"    Everybody's Changing - Another power-driven song. About changes in people. Good for those going through changes in life.  Key lyric: \\"You say you wander your own way, but when I think about it I don't see how you can.\\"    Your Eyes Open - It's the simplicity and beauty of the chorus that makes this song. Nice and relaxing - for those who are truly seeing another person in another light.  Key lyric: \\"I don't know you, I don't want to till the moment your eyes open and you know all the things I ever wanted you to know.\\"    Can't Stop Now - Power rocksong. The melody and musicality, especially Rice-Oxley's power piano are amazing. As with the bass - simply phenomenal. For those in a rush and are feeling bad about letting others down abouttheir promises because of that rush.  Key lyric: \\"And I can't slow down, for no one in town, and I can't stop now, for no one.\\"    Sunshine - I just like it. So...bizarrely interesting!  Key lyric: \\"Can anyone find their home?\\"    Bedshaped - Perfect - musically brilliant, instrumentally perfect, technically amazing, vocally stunning and lyrically beautiful. if this was out of 10 I'd give it 10/10. Great for those tired of a relationship but are getting back together with their partner. Rice-Oxley has crafted an ethereal melody which is nice and slow, Chaplin reaches a great high register with straining his voice which can be a bit hard on the ears to me, and that bass drum from Hughes goes great with a subwoofer.  Key lyric: \\"But what do I know? What do I kno-ow? I know.\\"    BONUS    I got the special DVD edition, so there is one more track which is actually my favorite  Snowed Under: Upbeat, but it's the most relevant song I've ever heard, and is absolutely perfect in every way. As an album closer it's actually like Pt. 2 of Bedshaped, because it ends the album for me on a high note, like the sun coming out after a storm. The end is just where it belongs - it's be out of place anywhere else. PHENOMENAL bass thump, drum beat and the best piano on the album - tied with Bedshaped. It's about letting insults after a relationship or hard words bounce right off you.  Key lyricS:  \\"I don't know why I waste my time, getting hung up about the things you say when I open my eyes and it's a lovely day.\\"    \\"Now you think that you're alo-ne, and you make your way back ho-me. I'd love to greet the weary traveler, but your time has gone and I'm glad it's over.\\"    THANKS!

0375842209|5.0|This was an amazing story. Truly extraordinary. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars and I wish I could take the author aside, look him in the eye, and tell him how much I truly loved this book. It was haunting, stunning, sad, amazing and gripping. I didn't know it was a Young Adult book. It was so powerful. I sobbed and sobbed at the end. So beautifully written.
0385340567|1.0|The previous book wasn't great, but I gave Child the benefit of the doubt.  This book really was it fo rme.  Lousy plot, silly situations, and a Reacher that was  nothing like the previous books.    Read this only if you have a read need for disappointment.
159562015X|5.0|I am the manager of a large Salon/Day Spa and we purchased a copy of this book for each of our employees. It is helping us learn how to manage each person based on their personality strengths rather than their weaknesses. They are also having a great time learning about each other in a different way. We all have a better understanding of each other.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Sure it isn't the deepest of movies, but is never boring and put together in astonishing fashion - can't imagine the maddening hours they must have put into this.  For those reluctant because it's a musical, I found it to be never full of itself or \\"insisting on itself\\" (which is the reason I can't stand musicals), but rather I found Moulin Rouge to be a lighthearted tongue in cheek jab at the stereotype, telling a tragic tale in a comic light that actually, made the story much more credible.  It's much like a live action cartoon, especially with the sound design, and the acting, considering what's described on paper, is outstanding considering everyone's playing a cartoon role in a sense, but it's completely sincere throughout.  Oddly not many people think of this as a comedy, but that's what I got out of it...a cartoonish jab at a dramatic story, that despite being satirical towards the genre, manages to still tell a credible story.  It's not the most unique story, but how it's told is.      I'd say definitely see it, even if you're doubtful.  It will either become your favorite movie or most despised (from talking with other people, there seems to be no middle ground).  But if it becomes your favorite movie, it's worth the gamble, right?

B000003CMB|3.0|The first time I heard this record back in 1971 when it was first released  my ears were opened. I was into the blues and was blown away with the duel lead guitars that Dickie Betts and Duane Allman played so well.  When I look back and evaluate who the great guitar players in Rock history are I have to include Duanne Allman among the very best.  It is as Eric Clapton once said \\"We were coming at the same thing from a different direction, I was bending strings and Duanne was playing slide.  Duanne Allman to this day is still possibly the best slide player I have ever heard. Ironically Derek Trucks is probably the best I have heard recently, ironically both from the Allman Brothers.   This Album is an abbreviated version of the classic live CD. If you want the entire CD you can get it now.  This version is missing One way out for instance and Mountain Jam and a few others. My advice is get the longer version and pay a few more dollars.  This CD does inclued Whipping Post, Stormy Monday, Statesboro Blues, Done somebody wrong, You dont love me, Hot 'Lanta and Momory of Elizabeth Reed.  You are in for some outstanding guitar. This is a classic any way you slice it..........................
B00003CXSP|5.0|Could you imagine it as a love story ? Yet... Imagine the ruthlessness of a man who is ready to wreck everything and everyone on his way to power. Then imagine the cold heart of Dr Lecter kindle and blaze for his Nemesis and his brain, trained by years of learning, entering the game with its unabatable determination backed by an unpaired ability to calculate and anticipate.   I have first seen \\"Hannibal\\" then \\"The silence of the lambs\\", and my preference goes to the former. While the latter is an amazing thriller, the plot is quite straightforward and the pair Starling - Lecter, a \\"teacher and student\\" team. \\"Hannibal\\", however, is masterfully more ambiguous and provides a lot more to think about.  One can see this film as the comeback of Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant villain ready to defy the all-powerful FBI in order to satisfy his ego or as a thriller that holds you before the screen until the end. Fans of gore will remember the scene where the famous doctor holds a lecture on the anatomy of the brain. But when he has given you almost every reason to hate and despise him, the brilliant minded - cold hearted psychopath will say with a voice that perfectly blends determination, resignation and tenderness : \\"This will really hurt\\"...   So is he truly the monster he is supposed to be? Wicked but ready to walk through (almost) hell for his longtime pursuer? Selfish? (You may want to reconsider this opinion at the end of the movie). And, speaking of monsters, who is the real one? The cannibal doctor or the ones ready to trespass every written and unwritten law with neither regret nor remorse, turning people into mere bait?  Lecter is, indeed, a man of contradictions. Aren't we all?  In the end, though, it's up to you. You can look at this movie as an entertaining piece of work with suspense, action and a well drawn plot, suitable to be seen once then put aside. You can also consider it as violent and cruel stuff, best avoided. Or you can choose to see it as a piece oflife where meanness and cruelty stand aside righteousness, courage and hope.   A small masterpiece in my opinion. Feel free to build yours...
B0000ADY9I|5.0|I remember the original vinyl album coming out in 1971. I listened to it many times and enjoyed the long versions of several songs including Whipping Post.  The CD came out and several songs were missing and I was disappointed.  Now we have a more complete ( if not complete version ) of the entire concert.  The duel guitars of Duanne Allman and Dicky Betts actually playing lead harmonies was something I dont remember hearing before this came out.  On the liner notes is says the Allman Brothers closed the Fillmore East, what a way to close it out.  If you want to listen to the Allman Brothers you need to get this expanded version, the abbreviated version is good but its like taking a shower with your clothes on, it just dont get it.  This is the finest hour of the Allman Brothers, unfortunatley just before Duannes' untimely death. Duanne is at his very best and plays possibly the best slide guitar I have ever heard, except for possibly Derek Trucks, who ironically is with the Allman Brothers currently. This is a classic to say the least.......................
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|Wow...I bought this cd after hearing one of their songs on Pandora and havent taken it out of the cd player yet. Everyone I let listen to it loves it as much as I do. Every week I have a new favorite song. Right now its \\"What a Shame\\"  Every song is amazing in its own way. Nice change ups throughout the cd. (Crow and the Butterfly is slower) I sing these songs at work and everything. Love Love Love it!!! I am a hardcore fan now!
B0015AARJI|5.0|OK, now we're in the generation of gaming with motion sensitive controlling, which has become a worldwide phenomena thanks to the Wiii. With the PS3 Sony have utilised the motion sensitive gaming whilst keeping the conventionally easy PS3 controller. The SIXAXIS controls of the PS3 pad allow game producers to implement certain motion sensitive aspects to their games, without it becoming too much for those less active gamers.<br /><br />The Dualshock controllers have been a part of the Playstation generation since the beginning and now they have the Dualshock 3. A controller that reacts with vibrations at certain instances within the game. Say if you're using the SIXAXIS while playing a driving game, you're steering the car with the motion sensing turned on, and you collide with a wall. The pad would vibrate with the same level of ferocity of how you hit the wall, in a sense giving you that additional level of realism.<br /><br />The battery life and size are also something I want to touch upon with the wireless PS3 pads. A full charge can literally give you more than 12 hours of solid gaming, and when compared to the wireless XBOX360 pads, the PS3 version is minute. It's light and just generally easy to hold when compared to the bulky and annoying XBOX360 pad.<br /><br />If you have a PS3, you should definitely own a wireless pad. So buy it.

B0007TKNIS|3.0|Let me kick off this review by saying I am a die-hard phan.  I've read the book, seen the stage production, and memorized the libretto.  When I heard this movie was being made, I was excited, and kept up with all the production news.    As it happens, I was terribly disappointed with this movie.  For a lot of reasons.  First of all, the performers left a lot to be desired.  Gerry Butler can not sing.  He can make noises that sound similar to pitched grunting and growling, but the man simply cannot sing.  Each song he performed was painful to listen to.  Honestly, I have listened to the \\"Music of the Night\\" scene once, and only once.  MotN is my favorite song and he completely killed it, so anytime I watch the movie I skip past that scene.  Surely there must be SOMEONE who could have given a better performance.  As for Emmy Rossum, she is good for being sixteen years old, but she simply does not have the skills or experience for the part of Christine.  Her voice is pleasant, but she has real difficulty hitting high notes and constantly scoops up to them.  That would be fine if this was a jazz production, but she is supposed to be singing opera.  But what really did her in was her horrible acting.  The graveyard scene in particular was horrific.  You're standing on your father's grave -- you want to shed a tear or two perhaps?  As for the rest of the cast, I would have to say they are mediocre at best.  I can understand that some roles do not allow for a life-altering performance, but none of them really made much of an impression on me.  Except for Patrick Wilson (Raoul).  He has a beautiful voice and sings with expression as well as excellent vocal technique.  He is, perhaps, the only member of the cast that makes the musical performance bearable.    In addition, there were so many alterations to the show that changed it for the worse.  Andre and Firmin are apparently a couple of pedophiles, which is made clear when they walk into the opera house staring at the young ballerinas like pieces of meat.  Lines that are meant to be sung are spoken.  (Who wants to listen to people rhyme when they speak?)  The entire \\"Don Juan\\" rehearsal scene was left out.  The scenes in the second act were jumbled around.  Piangi has what appears to be a midget side kick that mirrors his every move.  \\"New\\" scenes were added but do nothing for the plot.  And for me, the final nail in the coffin was the graveyard scene.  Not only was Rossum's performance of \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" pathetic, but \\"Wandering Child\\" was made into a poorly sung duet instead of the climactic trio it was meant to be.    I won't even get into the \\"disfiguration\\" of the phantom.  Honestly, Tom Cruise's character in \\"Vanilla Sky\\" looked more frightening than Schumacher's phantom.    However, there are some good things about this movie.  The music mostly stays true to the original score, which is nice.  Some lyrics are changed, but what can you do?  The cinematography and special effects are quite entertaining, mostly.  And again, Patrick Wilson's performance was beautiful.    All in all, it's better than nothing, right?
031606792X|1.0|It seemed like the whole book, save the first few chapters, came totally out of left field.  The wedding was expected, but the lack of epic battle, the addition of \\"Nessie\\" (*shudder*), Jacob's POV, and Bella becoming the \\"perfect Meyerpire\\" was completely ridiculous, to name a few.    Missing were the semesters at Dartmouth and the continued quarrel between Edward and Bella about becoming immortal for love's sake.    Also missing were the characters from Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, replaced by empty shells with the same names used in the other three novels.    It's too bad I can't get my time back that I spent on reading the book, because I did get my money back from the store.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|What a great romp of a film!  It's essentially a crime film but with a sly sense of humour at times and with various wonderful plot twists.  It's also quite confronting at times.  It's always entertaining.<br /><br />The film claims to be based on a true story.  The magnitude of the robbery on which it's based was greater than the Great Train Robbery.  Details were never allowed to be fully released as the crime had security implications.<br /><br />So, let me back up a bit.  A group of small time criminals gets a tip off about a bank vault where the alarms have been temporarily tuned off.  They intend to dig a tunnel from an adjacent building and steal the contents of the various safe deposit boxes.  In spite of themselves, they succeed.  The money and jewels are stolen in the heist but so too are compromising photographs of Princess Margaret and others of various cabinet ministers.  Needless to say, the photos are more valuable to some people than the money.<br /><br />Through a series of crosses and double crosses, the gang mainly but not totally succeeds.  Along the way, the plot twists and turns and the viewer is always kept guessing.  Jason Statham as the leader of the team is very convincing.  His beautiful accomplice Saffron Burrows provides some sexual tension to the story.  She is quite a revelation.<br /><br />I recommend this film without question.  The British are very good at producing a crime thriller.  Hollywood could take a few lessons.  Do yourself a favour, go and see this film.
0316143472|5.0|I am not sure how one person has so many excruciatingly funny stories, but I laughed out loud reading this!  On the plane.  In bed.  Be prepared to tell people what you are reading... this is too good to keep to yourself.
0671015206|2.0|Don't get me wrong, this book is founded on smart advice.  Its main morals are the following:  - Don't believe what you see in the media; most millionaires don't live extravagant, consumption-driven lifestyles.  The pursuit of status is stratospherically expensive, and chances are that guy you see pulling out of the Super-Size McMansion in his Benz is a hardcore spender with above-average income but little accumulated wealth.  - The rich get rich by spending prudently (no $5,000 watches or $50,000 cars) and investing wisely.  No matter your income, live below your means.  - If you want your kids to learn the lessons of financial independence, avoid giving them cash handouts, which they'll come to expect all their lives and will weaken them mentally.  Just invest a crapload in their education and leave the rest alone.    All useful stuff, but the way the authors tell it makes the book a chore to read.  The depth of the narrative never goes past personalizing those points with long-winded anecdotes filled with numbers, few of which succeed in really animating the messages.  As the chapters go on, you find yourself just plowing through one indistinguishable story after another, most of which repeat the same points.  This book could have easily been 100 (maybe 200) pages shorter.

B00005JPY0|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is the very dramatic sequel to \\"Batman Begins\\", returning Christopher Nolan as director and Christian Bale as the Batman, along with Gary Oldham as Lt. Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.  In this movie, Gotham has become an even darker place, in which the violence is scary and realistic and even the Batman can be hurt or killed.  There is no safety net.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" introduces two new characters. One is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhardt), the new District Attorney, new crusader against crime, and new lover of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal in for Katie Holmes).  The other newcomer is the Joker (Heath Ledger in a terrifying turn), criminal, psychopath, and ruthless anarchist.  The movie turns on his ability to force other characters into terrible choices.  He will offer Harvey Dent the choice of justice or revenge.  And he will force the Dark Knight to choose between stopping evil and protecting the people he loves...<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is highly recommended to fans of the franchise as the ultimate in high tech film noir.
0596522347|5.0|...for your personal professional library. Or, for those of you who are mentors, coaches and teachers, the book should be required (or at least a supplemental class text) for either Business Communication, Marketing Communication, or Public Speaking. Slide:ology reaches a broad audience because it offers a new way to think about presentations. It also provides practical examples and inside tips for the beginners on how to turn words into visual images. Even if you are veteran slide-jock or designer, you should find Slide:ology useful and an enjoyable read. Chapters 2 and 3 alone are well worth the investment!

B00005MKA1|4.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers-Kaya ****<br /><br />Kaya is the stereotypical Marley album. This is the album that satisfies that theory that Marley was a laid back pot head instead of a activist, street fighting man called tuff gong. Which blows my mind because next to [[ASIN:B00005KB9X Natty Dread]] this is his least popular album and only contains one true hit. Two if you count 'Satisfy My Soul.'<br /><br />Many have a love or hate relationship with the album. The first half is genius and full of some of his and the Wailers best music. No one will deny this, not on my watch anyway. The second half is decent but could have been a lot stronger.<br /><br />The entire album is made up of random tracks through Marley's career that for one reason or another didn't end up on other albums. The relaxed title track/stoner anthem dates all the way back to 1972. But most of the second side is left overs from the brilliant [[ASIN:B00005LANG Exodus]] album.<br /><br />'Could You Be Loved' 'Easy Skanking' 'Sun Is Shining' and 'Satisfy My Soul' make this the perfect album for the morning after. 'Crisis' and 'Running Away' while both could have been way better serve as conscious anthems making this a true Marley album. 'Shes Gone' is both sad and uplifting. 'Time Will Tell' could have been a nice change but comes up short, though it does end the album well enough.<br /><br />Kaya is a great album despite being Marley & The Wailers' weakest effort. But for an album of left overs this kills. In my book Marley & The Wailers are one of the truly great bands. I feel they never really made anything bad, and Kaya is no exception.
