B005LAJ22Q|5.0|In all fairness, I must admit that, with certain exceptions, I am not a fan of horror movies or television series.<br /><br />I am even less a fan of the \\"zombie\\" movie.  Frankly, I think they are silly.  [Sorry, George Romero.]<br /><br />On the other hand, I love a well-written, intelligent script...even if it is in the horror genre.  Good writing is good writing, no matter where you find it.<br /><br />THE WALKING DEAD may have been adapted from a series of graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, and there are plenty of zombies walking around and feasting in the thirteen-episode second season, but these decaying creatures take a back seat to the compelling human dramas that are played out between the survivors.<br /><br />Because we, as an audience, come to care about these multi-dimensional characters, several of whom do not survive the season, when the zombies (aka: \\"walkers\\") do attack they are anything but \\"silly\\".  They are truly frightening.<br /><br />Viewers who enjoy blood, guts and gore will not be disappointed, but unlike most zombie movies, that's not what this series is about.  In THE WALKING DEAD, story and character trump visceral delights.<br /><br />I am not going to give specific plot details, except to say that this season not only finds the survivors taking refuge on a remote farm, populated by a veterinarian (Scott Wilson), his daughters and some neighbors, but there is also a deadly insurrection brewing within the core group.<br /><br />All of the performances in the show are superb, as are the Georgia-filmed series' visual effects, make-up and other elements.  This is a first-rate production.<br /><br />My chief concern about the program's future is: How long can the creators successfully continue the basic premise without resolving it?<br /><br />Most shows of this ilk (i.e. ones with one continuing story line) run out of steam after a season or two and are better suited as \\"limited series.\\"  Hopefully, the producers will not allow this excellent series to overstay its welcome.<br /><br />The four-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes many extras, \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes, webisodes and deleted scenes.<br /><br />© Michael B.

038572179X|5.0|eviewing a novel is a personal thing.  It is said that there really are only a handful of stories out there, seven supposedly, and in writing a novel it is a case of how well one manages to readdress the old themes that have percolated through western civilization for the past 4,000 years.<br /><br />Ian McEwan is one of Britain's leading and most prolific novelists who does not write novels as much as he composes fugues with words.  These meandering bursts of prose, that  appear at first to be going god knows where, but in the end it all comes together nicely.<br /><br />This book is about several things. First, without spoiling anything and taking away the pleasure of the discovering the Tallis family, it is about atonement for past sins.  It is also a meditation on sex, war, and most importantly on the creative process and in particular on that of Briony Tallis, an English girl, with a creative bent.<br />If I were to try and identify what made this work significant and important for me, it would be that the work is about the role and responsibility of the artist and the role that art can play in society. Reducing the novel to this essence probably is more than a little off-putting, but I think it is a primary theme and worth considering when approaching this work.  Novelists who depend on the creative process are probably the ones most likely to consider it when approaching the work and ponder its significance when crafting plots and peopling them with heroes and villains.  Briony Tallis in some respects stands in for the novelist himself.<br /><br />Mcewan drops some clues that he intends to have the Tallis family and its trials and tribulations stand in for what is happening in Britain.  First there is the name, why use that of one of England's first composers if there is not some sort of appeal to history?  Smith, Jones, or even Windsor would have carried less weight in this context.<br /><br />The appeal to history is further underscored by the setting, first one of those British country houses so beloved of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Enid Blyton, and even P.G. Wodehouse and even.  Yes a crime is committed there, but it is not by the person one expects and it is resolved in not quite the manner one is used to in other literary genres.  Next there is the Blitz and Dunkirk and the Imperial War Museum.  History is almost as important a character as Briony Tallis if not as overt.<br /><br />The way in which the novel concludes is interesting and probably the thing that will either delight or anger readers.  Briony has to complete her initial act of atonement in order to become a first rate author, the kind worthy of the sort of valedictory celebration, only without the presence of the pairs of lovers that are helped and harmed by what could be considered her first act of mature fiction. In this act she moves beyond the juvenile plays she is found of staging into something less comfortable and less  safe than what her previous audience would have expected.  It is the awakening of this mature view of life and its complex motivations that lie within that drives the book forward and provides its ultimately satisfying conclusion.t one of those British country houses so beloved of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Enid Blyton, and even P.G.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great appl. It is a resource. I Would recommend to my friends and acquaintences. I use it all the time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is super fun and doesn't rush you. your coins wont expire if you don't collect in a certain amount of time and you can play at your speed. just wish I could win more acorns in order to get things.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game to pass time. some games become very challenging and you don't want to stop playing. the only problem I have is too many adds.
B003UXX0JW|5.0|It's a great show, a shame they didn't give it a 3 season chance!!! it's fun, sexy, and addicting..what else can you ask from a TV show.<br />if you like shows like Merlin, once upon the time, and movies like lord of the rings, you will love this show
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am truly addicted!  I love the way there are different levels of difficulty.  This is a great game to keep a senior's mind sharp.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the fact that I can have so many games at my finger tips. and the fact that the more I play the more levels that open up!
B0063GORYU|5.0|so much fun!! hours of play!!!! challenging and glad they have different options to play...4 deck is the best and hard to beat.....
B008VOHQNQ|5.0|The character development in this show is great. The legal part of the show is only to provide context for great characters to develop and it makes law as a profession look enticing. The writing is tight and the dialogue is quick and witty. One of the best shows I have ever seen.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is prone to fingerprints on the back of the cover.  So not only am I wiping the front of my screen all the time but I am wiping the back too! But.....it is one of the best covers I have purchased due to the fact that gives it great protection from falls, which when in my children's hands tend to happen a lot.  Also, you do not have to remove cover to dock into speaker or to use clock adapter, which is one of the best things about it.
0345803485|1.0|I got this book on my Kindle, wanting to see what all the hype was about.  If you have not yet purchased it, I BEG YOU, run away.  This is a trite, boring, badly-written piece of garbage.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Just a quick note - I was surprised to find this is not the three-disc Thinpak with the magnetic cover. This is the boxed, full-size Blue Ray containers, one for each of the movies. This set was released at the same time as the Thinpak in 2010 at a noticeable higher price back then. This set was $60.00, while the Thinpak was sold for about half. From a couple of the reviews I mistakenly thought I was ordering a Thinpak set and was thinking this is not much saving over its original price. I was wrong. It arrived in perfect condition.
B0086700CM|5.0|Total timewaster...which is great if you need to waste time.  You'll love the easy play while having fun achieving goals and unlocking new characters.  A must-have!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Not too bad! I like how quickly you can earn money. No need to walk away for 6 hours while you wait for more money or energy.
159562015X|2.0|This is an interesting topic.  I have no experience with other similar products, so when I saw the good reviews, I decided to check it out.  I borrowed the book from the library.  The first twenty or so pages are all about getting you excited to find out your strengths.  I then found out that I cannot use the online strength finder program without purchasing the book.  The program requires an access code, and only one user may use it, so I was out of luck.  It seems strange to me that each book can only benefit one person.  It doesn't even make sense for this book to be provided by the library.  That just makes me think that the author is primarily interested in making money and not so much in actually conveying his message to the public.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun and challenging as it gets more complicated. nice to play...put down and come back to it when u need something mindless to do.
B0085HWZDK|5.0|I've seen Robert Plant in concert three times. The best thing I can call this concert DVD is uplifting. It's a different take and different style of tunes that are new and tunes that are tried and true. I saw the Band of Joy about three or so months after this show was recorded in Nashville. Needless to say, they didn't disappoint. Great interview with Robert as well. The closing number is very poignant. The DVD itself got here in quick time. Good seller, good product, good quality.

B0072X2NUS|5.0|Please hit me in the head as hard as you can with a sledgehammer.  I have listened to this album so many times, so loud, that I have a headache but I can't help but listen to it again.  No I don't want to stop.  So on second thought just leave me alone I'm going to play it again.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The movie begins by introducing several retirees who must make a decision about their future.They decide living in India would be a less expensive, exotic place to retire after reading advertisements for the newly restored Marigold Hotel. When they arrive, they find out that the restoration is in progress. They must then decide how to deal with their new lives. Some deal better than others.<br /><br />This movie is full of great actors such as Judy Dench, John Madden, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith, just to name a few. I'll watch this one more than once.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|An easy and quick read, this book takes the reader on an emotional journey as experienced by the two main characters who are of young adult age. These young characters along with their even younger siblings taught me, a middle-aged woman, a great deal about living life to the fullest. I couldn't help but fall in love with them and their story. The words of advice provided by the mom to her children are words I will certainly steal and impart to my own daughters. I love words and the words in this book are fabulous!
B005LAIIQC|2.0|This movie was a huge disappointment.  It was just a rip off of the earlier Jason Bourne movies which I enjoyed. There wasn't much plot or suspense, but plenty of ridiculous chase scenes. The motorcycle chase at the end lasted forever. So did the movie which ran two and a half hours.<br /><br />Jason Bourne is referred to, but this plot had nothing whatsoever to do with him. A new agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is introduced. When the scientific research supporting genetic testing on agents is discontinued, everyone on the project must be eliminated.<br /><br />I guess they tied this movie to the popular Bourne movies to pull people in. That's not a good idea if they ever intend to do another real Jason Bourne film.
B0018O4YT0|1.0|Upon opening the DVD case, the DVD was cracked from edge to center.  I was not able to play the DVD and I promptly returned it.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|I love mystery and suspense and this film has both. It's bloody and violent and sometimes humorous. You keep thinking \\"how can this guy's day get any worse?\\" And it does.<br /><br />Roger Brown is Norway's most successful headhunter, but that doesn't pay for the lifestyle he thinks he needs to keep his gorgeous wife, Diana. The unscrupulous Brown finances his extravagance by way of dangerous art thefts. When he meets Dutchman Clas Greve he sees the chance to become financially independent and starts planning his biggest heist ever. His usual crimes are nonviolent but in a day that goes from bad to worse, Roger's comfortable lifestyle is destroyed and he finds himself running for his life.<br /><br />Hollywood will probably come out with its own version of this film, but see this one first.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I just love to be able to fall asleep faster with it on especially. with the dream mode humming all night
B0083SBJXS|3.0|I saw the Avengers with my two grandsons (ages 7 and 5).  They thoroughly enjoyed it, laughing and cheering as the good super heroes dispatched the bad guys with relative ease. I also liked the movie the way I like watching Daffy Duck cartoons on a Saturday morning as it brought out my own inner child. I was pleased that I didn't need to cover the kids eyes at any point in the film as I did when they watched X-Men First Class. I found the movie to be a pleasant 2 + hour diversion from the real world (unfortunately there are no super heroes, Norse gods or flying air craft carriers, in my world and the bad things aren't so easy to fix).  I'd describe the movie as fluff or pap. There's nothing socially relevant here and that was fine with me. Personally I didn't think \\"The Avngers\\" was as deep as Disney/Pixar's \\"The Incredibles.\\" There was a minimum amount of dramatic tension. My grandsons and I never doubted that the Avengers would conquer the evil Loki and his minions in grand fashion and save the earth. We also didn't fear that any of the Avengers would be hurt or killed (they have to be available for the blockbuster sequels). The weird creatures Loki (Thor's jealous step brother) employs to aid him seemed quite fragile and even \\"Black Widow\\" who doesn't have any super powers was able to kill them by the dozens as if they were nothing more than big pesky insects. There were several funny moments interspersed throughout the film to lighten things up whenever they got a little too heavy for the kids.  The talented actors really get into their roles and play them with just the right balance of seriousness and comic satire and wit.  The Avengers is great escapist entertainment and I would recommend it to anyone who loves comics, and enjoys action / adventure heavily laced with CGI special effects and isn't looking for something edgy or dark
B006LSZECO|1.0|I'd heard all the hype about this book and was eager to check it out. It was interesting but I thought it was way too drawn out. I was really disappointed!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love Doodle God! I love the child safety mode and the extra game modes.I just wish Doodle devil was free and so was Doodle God.(maybe a free day when the games are free!!! But please tell me) :) lol  luv this game.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I recieved the DVD in good condition w/in a week of my order. The movie stayed pretty much to the book(s),\\"Princess of Mars.\\" Burroughs wrote a series of John Carter's adventures on Mars (Barsoom). I found the DVD entertaining and nostalgic for the days when science fiction had romance and high adventure. The movie is full of that... with sword play, leaping, and a princess to save.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Burroughs wrote or published theses stories 90-95 years ago. As we've learned through our probes (Curiousity being the latest), Mars is not Barsoom ... there is no Tars Tarkas. Perhaps, that is why the movie didn't do so well. When Burroughs wrote these stories, Mars was more fantasy than reality.<br />Still, if you like high swash-buckling adventure and romaance on another world, this movie does offer you that. It has great stunts, good effects, giant martian apes, a plot that moves along, an ending with a twist, and a promise of even more adventures to come. These books inspired some of the leading scientists if the mid and late 20th century, when they were kids. The late Dr. Carl Sagan, noted astro-physicist (worked on the Voyager space probe, and hosted the \\"Cosmos\\" TV show in the 70s) was one of those kids. So... get the DVD, and the incredible adventures of John Carter on Mars will await you on a rainy afternoon.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I like these headphone because they have a headband and the fit well in my ears. I cannot stand the loose fitting ear plug type headphones. I had a foldable Sony which broke and these were the closest I could find. They were inexpensive but I find the sound very acceptable for my Ipod at the gym. Why pay $100's when MP3 format looses fidelity by nature of the format.<br />Taking off 1 star as they do not fold.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is amazing, you will not stop playing it once you start. its extreamly addicting and mind stimulating. I highly suggest it.
B004LROUW2|2.0|The book starts very strong in establishing questions and characters, events move at a crisp pace. However after the 1st book(1st 1/3) the story begins slowing down dramatically. By the last book in the story, its been at a dead halt for awhile with the characters being introspective but basically sitting around doing nothing. This is a book that some people will love. This does not include me. The writing style was decent, so I may enjoy other work by the author, but this one definitely feels like it died out due to length.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this app has helped me relax or fall asleep faster since I got it.  the free app is great too just less choices.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because you can play lots of games.And I also like Romeo's plan. So you should play it. Its awesome.
034580404X|1.0|Was boring,  kept doing the same things over and over... I thought it was going to a romantic novel...but it was only about sex..disappointing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are pretty fun and a good time killer. I took away 1 star because it's difficult to control some of the movement on the kindle.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|Honestly speaking I am not one of these typical Rush fans that just absolutely loves everything Rush puts out... I honestly do not understand for the life of me how this album is getting 4 stars... I thought Vapor Trails is better then this album & that isn't saying much... I just don't get it.... Before any of you Rush fans attempt to try & rip me for saying this save it... I have decided to add more to my comment here & I still stand by my original review of this album... I do NOT like this album & I think that ever since Rush parted ways with Terry Brown they have lost a lot of his expertise especially in the studio & it shows immensely... After listening to this cd a few more times it just did not do anything for me... I believe that most of the fans here who are giving this album 4-5 stars are doing so more out of loyalty then anything else.. In my opinion their last good decent album was \\"Hold Your Fire\\" & in my opinion it's been downhill from there... Their best years were with Terry Brown hands down & if he were to come back you'd hear a major difference in their music...
B006CUDDUG|4.0|I rate this as a good book, not a great book only because it could have ended better for me. Would like to see a re-make of the movie. It had some twist and turn for sure, but if you read it passionately you can sort of see what is coming, a good read, not great, but worth the time.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Led Zeppelin has been one of my favorite rock bands since I first listened to them in the 70's. They are still one my favorite rock bands, I can listen to their music over and over again. This is a great collection of their work and I highly recommend it to anyone, age is no barrier.
B0053KWDES|4.0|[[ASIN:B004QVPGXK FiiO E11 Portable Headphone Amplifier With Micca Accessory Pack (Wall Charger and Extra Battery Pack)]]I realy injoyed the FIIO E11 for the few days I was able to use it. Then to my dismayment the dam thing died. When<br />I pluged the unit in for recharge no lights came on. So i pulled the battery out to test it while doing so I heard something  loose rattling around inside the unit like a piece of sodder. The battery read 3.1 volts. I tried differant<br />cables and still the unit would not take a charge at all! However the E11 preformed great and I will order another<br />one and hope this be OK. I installed it in the middle of an XM roady to the front aux port with a 3.5mm ground<br />isolater. This team-up makes pure beauty of clean sound and it cranks with no disstortion what so ever!  I own<br />many electonics and a lot of them are made in CHINA why does this situation have  to happen to me. The plastic<br />housing is cheap and not very road worthy The E5 I owned prior was much better made and lasted for years of<br />musical bliss:-) I rate the E11 four stars out of five do to the fact it died and is poorly made using light weight<br />plastic.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the first half of the book and I liked how it was different points of views as the other half. Man, did I hate his wife! You probably have to read it to know what I mean without spoiling it. The good thing is that this book actually made me have a feeling with a character (hating them, liking them etc) so that was something I usually dont get with other books. Its just ok.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Duhigg drives home the notion that 40 percent of our daily actions are not decisions but rather habits that we have formed over time. Successful businesses, sports teams, and self-help organizations, like alcoholics anonymous, often practice the principles of habit that Duhigg lays as the foundation in his book. Understanding how habits form, by recognizing the cue, routine, and reward, is rather simple after breaking down each part of the habit. Once one is able to recognize each part of the habit, Duhigg offers ways to change habits and improve oneself.<br /><br /> If you are looking to dissect habits of individuals, successful businesses, and societies, this is a remarkable book for you. The influence that habits have over these three entities is truly amazing. Duhigg discusses success stories like the Indianapolis Colts championship journey, Starbucks Coffee, and Proctor and Gambles product research of Febreeze. Revisiting historical figures, such as Rosa Parks, solidifies Duhigg's point on societal influence.<br /><br /> A section of this book is dedicated to the moral discussion of whether criminal liability exists due to habits. Examples cited are committing crimes during sleep while reacting to dreams. This section, in my opinion, could have been excluded from the book and really doesn't tie in with the outlined curriculum. In fact, Duhigg decided to conclude his book with the inquiry, \\"Are we responsible for our habits?\\" As a hopeful reader, I would have enjoyed a different conclusion that tied together all of the habit research and gives direction. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to all those interested in the science of habit.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest books I have read. I actually laughed out loud which is hard to do since there arent very funny books around. Im not a fan of Jen Lancasters ranting nor do I laugh out loud at her books like I do at Tinas. Its awesome to read what she did before SNL and movies and just her life stories. I read it in less than  a day, I could not put it down. If you like funny,read this book!
030758836X|5.0|Wow! Riveting! Surprising!<br />This book reminded me of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? In its chilling depiction of what we do to each other within our relationships  (fortunately expanded beyond what most of us experience).<br />A mystery full of food for thought.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have met a lot of people who have read this book because of the hype but I have not found one person who has said they liked it. If you are into mommy porn because you don't get any, you will probably like this book. If you are 16 and think that's what love is and this is basically your fantasy(porn and Twilights romance) you will LOVE this book.<br />I hear they are making the movie but I don't know how people will hear them with all their \\"murmuring\\" and \\"muttering\\" while they \\"bite their lip and look through their lashes\\" while they \\"roll their eyes\\" at each other. Its so repetitive with no plot and no imagination. 5 weeks together and then they marry? Seriously? Also,just sex with the same result in her \\"shattering into a million peices\\" in different locations.WORST BOOK EVER!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this book was a little slow. I bought it after reading other reviews and thought I would enjoy it. I did figure out most of the<br />story. I hated the ending.

0553801503|4.0|I just completed George R.R. Martin's hotly debated, decidedly polarizing fourth installment, \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" and can honestly say that I completely understand both sides of the apparent positive/negative reviews. However, some negative reviewers have gone WAY overboard in suggesting that it's NOT even worth a read, and in doing so, are doing new readers a huge disservice.<br /><br />Here's what you need to know: Your level of enjoyment and appreciation of this book will be contingent upon properly gauged expectations.<br /><br />***IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- For those who have not yet read AFFC -- and are merely perusing these reviews in an attempt to \\"test to waters\\" before diving in -- be advised that Martin's (original) intention was to combine the 4th and 5th installment (\\"A Dance with Dragons\\") into one epic tale. But due to time constraints and incessant prodding and pressure from his publisher, rampant fan demand, and understandable size limitations, Martin opted to split what would've been an excruciatingly large tale into two - \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\"***<br /><br />This is crucial to be aware of to prepare you for the reality that many of your well-known, undoubtedly popular characters from previous books are completely (and intentionally) absent from AFFC. These include fan favorites such as Dany, Tyrion, and Bran; while pivotal characters such as Jon Snow and Stannis are barely made reference to.<br /><br />If you go into the book with an acceptance of this knowledge; trusting in Martin's various decisions and direction, you'll be much better off for having done so.<br /><br />In AFFC, Martin's endless array of characters, and trademark ability to flesh out his fantasy world, bolster and further lend credibility to the realism of the overall tale. I would be remiss, however, if I didn't acknowledge the unavoidable effect that the absence, of the very characters that kept us engrossed in the saga up until this point, has on AFFC's pacing.<br /><br />I consider this neither good nor bad - it is what it is.<br /><br />The best analogy that can be made for the flow-and-feel of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" -- from \\"A Game of Thrones\\" (Book I) through \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (Book IV) -- is a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Think of GOT as the slow ascent up a very steep initial hill; much buildup and anticipation are created with a sure-fire, exhilarating payoff to follow. By the time you arrive at the appendix of ASOS, you've been sent through a series of twists, turns, and loops, endless thrills, and freight train-like momentum.<br /><br />AFFC now throttles down and returns you to the starting point, so to speak, where you enjoyed the ride so much that you've hopped on for a second one. But back at the starting point of the ride, you again embark on your journey up the ponderous uphill climb...and wait for the inevitable payoff.<br /><br />The story is bleak. Most of the characters are dealing with the aftermath of a war that they feel has reached its conclusion, and are now left to pick up the pieces. The crows are now feasting on the flesh of the dead. The mood is chilling, unforgiving, and very real.<br /><br />While Westeros remains smack in the middle of the eye of the storm, few are aware of the obvious (to the reader) looming, ever-present threat that remains. As always, the wise remain wary, and the arrogant remain blinded by their own hubris.<br /><br />We are introduced to many new locations such as Braavos and Oldtown, and given a tour of other cities including Dorne and The Iron Islands, which had otherwise been but scantily made reference to up until this point. How exactly they are woven into the story - ultimately shown to be of great import and essential for setting up what's yet to come - I will not specifically go into.<br /><br />Though inclusion of so many new locations and characters could have created a problematic disconnect between the previous installments, Martin is clearly cognizant of this potential pitfall and expertly brings it all together, as he always does.<br /><br />Again, it comes down to trust in Martin's direction. And patience, more than anything.<br /><br />AFFC's biggest \\"downfall\\" is its stark contrast in pacing, a notable decrease in delightful, jaw-dropping \\"curveballs,\\" and the gradual (at times plodding) development of so many new locations and characters, from its previous offerings in Book III.<br /><br />It puts on the breaks and allows you to sit back in an upright position, where you had previously been hunched over, and on the edge of your seat throughout its predecessor, ASOS.<br /><br />In sum, AFFC is an extremely entertaining book in its own right; consistent with Martin's trademark style and uncanny ability to draw you into his imaginary world, veritably smelling the smells and seeing the sights, while fully engrossing you with new storylines, and endearing you to a flurry of new characters.<br /><br />It's a truly fitting installment that seemingly serves, above all else, to set up the remainder of the story. Though at times the pace can frustrate, you are ultimately always made to see why the inclusion of each new story and character is both essential and a clear precursor to the next thrilling ride to come.<br /><br />I commend Martin's decision in making no obvious attempts to compete with the non-stop chaos of ASOS, and for remaining true to his vision. AFFC does not cater to one's need to keep followers entertained for the sake of...entertainment, and he makes no attempt to throw in cheap thrills.<br /><br />If you stop and think about it, the titles of the books all but telegraph what the overall storyline will consist of. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" introduces you to the game; key players conspiring against one another for power. \\"A Clash of Kings\\" pits those who have declared themselves king against each other. \\"A Storm of Swords\\" depicts the violent battles, never-ending bloodshed, and death associated with war. And of course, A Feast for Crows\\" deals with the subsequent effects and dire consequences of the aforementioned.<br /><br />So just to reiterate, if you are the type of reader who relies on action and battles in every chapter to enjoy the read, you will surely be disappointed. This is not to say that twists and surprises aren't aplenty in AFFC. They just (clearly) pale in comparison to the sheer abundance of non-stop, paper cut inducing action provided in ASOS.<br /><br />I give \\"A Feast for Crows\\" a solid four stars (admittedly graded on a curve) and look forward to the payoff in \\"A Dance with Dragons.\\"<br /><br />I would advise to go into your read with the full-understanding that you are, in all actuality, investing in two books - not just the one. Perspective does help.<br /><br />And be glad that if - like me - you're just now making your way through this sweeping saga, you don't have to wait 6 years to have your patience rewarded in  the 2nd part of the story, as so many of Martin's hordes of original, faithful readers were made to.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was one of the best books I've ever read.  Funny, nasty, poignant, and unpredictable, I couldn't put it down!  Though I can't say I \\"liked\\" the characters, I found them, their marriage and their story fascinating.  Enough twists to keep me guessing, enough pathos to keep me turning the pages.

0812982622|5.0|This is a literary masterpiece which can be grouped with Orwell's 1984 and the many other novels that portrayed the savagery of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Set in North Korea's dystopia, readers of this novel may be challenged by shifts between narrators, the confusion of two men with the same name, a disjointed timeline, and the overlay of a serialized \\"short story\\" in the text.  Distressing brutality and torture make for some grim reading.  We know so little of North Korea that it's difficult to know where the novel reflects true conditions, and where author Adam Johnson's imagination has reached beyond to make the point.<br /><br />If the novel seems hard to follow, it's because readers live in a world ordered by truth, which even in novels anchors timelines, narratives, policies, characters, and moral outlooks.  This novel portrays a world ordered only by the whims of a \\"Dear Leader\\" who has at his command the full police and security apparatus of a state.<br /><br />-30-

B006BGZJJ4|2.0|The insulation from two early Kindle cables disintegrated in a few month's time. These were the original USB cables and were, in my view, defective when shipped. After contacting Amazon on the two separate occasions, new cables were shipped to me at no cost to me and are now working perfectly. Although they should not have been defective in the first place, Amazon rose to the occasion without argument and shipped two new cables.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved the book. No regrets. Lots of sex which just kinda went with the book until about half way through the second book where you kinda start thinking, \\"again???\\" lol, and then the third the author must realize this because she builds it up to the point but then stops writing before the sex.  But it was a great book and I didn't want it to ever end. I really felt like I knew the characters and I love that. So when I was done with 50 shades I downloaded Bared to you on my Kindlefire and that had the same effect on me. Can't wait to finish that trilogy either!!

B003X2O6KW|5.0|My tastes in music range from classical and traditional jazz to metal and alternative, with a healthy dose of eccentrics like Tom Waits, Maynard James Keenan (Tool, Perfect Circle), Anton Bruckner (1824-1896), and late jazz great Bix Beiderbecke (1903-1931).  What a surprise to find this disc.  To describe it as original would be an understatement - every song on it is a incredibly well executed and fully enjoyable.  I have discs numbering into the thousands, but I return to this one often.  This CD is definitive proof that the Hip Hop/Rap genre deserves respect from serious music lovers and audiophiles.
0345803493|4.0|Once you get over the fact that she only left him for FIVE days it becomes an entrancing tale.  This book is highly unlikely to be related to real life seeing how he makes 100,000 a hour. With that said I still became entranced with Christian Grey even with all his fifty shades.  This book gives more depth into his crazy life and feelings.  It is definitely an easy read

0345803507|5.0|We all fell in love with Christian despite his many issues.  Every woman wants a man who is a billionaire extremely handsome and with an issue we can fix to mold him.  It is a great fairy tale to get us away from reality.  It was Ana I had the most problem with.  I think it could had been due to her lack of male relationships that she acted like an adolescent but then again so did Christian at times. I did like the last part where she told the the story through Christian's eyes.  She should rewrite them through his point of view and keep the saga going.
0142419400|2.0|Also appears on my blog, the YA Kitten!<br /><br />With my summer almost over, I wanted to indulge in something fluffy--you know, the kind of fluffy fun summer reading is made of. With rave reviews all around praising its swoony male lead and cute romance, Anna and the French Kiss seemed like a good bet.<br /><br />It wasn't.<br /><br />Perkins undeniably has talent as a writer. Anna's narrative voice is engaging and some of the scenes are so adorable that I smiled a little bit despite my annoyance. It was only when I remembered who was having the cute scene (usually Anna and St. Clair) and what kind of people they were (really terrible people) that I stopped smiling. That the author's talent is wasted telling the story of despicable characters like Anna and St. Clair is a shame because with more likable characters, I could see myself loving this book the way everyone else does.<br /><br />See, Anna makes me want to scream because she hates all other women who are her \\"competition\\" in any way, shape, or form for a guy she likes. Amanda, Bridgette, Ellie, eventually Meredith--all of them. She describes them badly (which isn't help by the narrative portraying them badly and I have a boatload of issues with that) and is generally a hypocrite. I'm not into abundant girl-hate in novels and that's exactly what Anna and the French Kiss has to offer. Her melodrama about non-problems like going to a beautiful boarding school in France didn't endear her to me either.<br /><br />Meanwhile, St. Clair is a terrible guy--not swoonworthy at all. He spends the entire book leading Anna on when he already has a girlfriend while also discouraging any guys who show interest in Anna and that is the sign of a guy who isn't worth any girl's time. He doesn't like change? Too bad. How much I care is less than or equal to zero. I feel he would have done something about it much earlier than he did if she really mattered to him. Seeing him be praised as THE BEST GUY EVER makes me want to find a trash can.<br /><br />I estimate that I began skimming somewhere around page 100 and didn't stop until the book ended. Everyone good pronouncing Anna and St. Clair to be the best people ever when they're not was too annoying to sit through for long. I wanted them to be together solely so no one else had to deal with being in a relationship with them. If they can tolerate each other's crap, why not let them? It saves other people the pain of having to deal with it.<br /><br />This book is very, very lucky I'm gifting it two stars and not just throwing one badly-constructed star at it. The cheesy, soapbox-like way homosexuality is declared okay and slut shaming is declared wrong (but only when it's Anna being called a slut; all the other girls are fair game and this hypocritical position is yet another reason why I hate this book) made me want to give the book only one star, but with writing this great, I couldn't. Anna and the French Kiss should consider itself lucky.<br /><br />Recommendations of well-written, non-offensive fluff, please? I'm a little tired of being negative.a trash can.<br /><br />I estimate that I began skimming somewhere around page 100 and didn't stop until the book ended.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought my G155 Gaming system a little over a month ago and I have to say it was very well worth the money. I am currently deployed and having this over here with me has been a dream! I have it set up on my desk and on those long 12 hour shift days It's nice to be able to kick back and watch a movie or play games. The 720P HDTV inside is great! The quality of the video is excellent as well as the sound!! As far as a portable way to game it is a very well built system. A couple of buddies of mine have even said they are ordering one for themselves soon! For the price and what it can do, Why not? Go ahead a try it, you won't regret it.
0553382152|1.0|As a physician I have asked many patients that were resuscitated about their experience, I have asked family members as well friends looking to find anybody that might have had similar experiences, I have read Dr. Moody's books, Elizabeth Kuebler-Ross' books and sadly also Betty Eadie's books. In hindsight it was all a waste of time. Very sad though, since for quite some time I believed that the exploration and maybe even scientific validation of near dath experiences would give me the proof of the existence of an after life. Looking back on many years of believing and reading - it failed! The few physicians that published on this topic never continued their research into this area and some even went off the deep end, personally, scientifically and professionally. Were near death experiences truly be the powerful \\"turn your life around\\" experiences, then you would expect that after decades of research into this topic and the high interest of many parties - the mighty religious organizations at the very least - that you would have something to show, something, anything at all - published papers, one or two congresses, some numbers, statistics, some kind of scientific method regarding this phenomenon - but........NOTHING. Don't you think more physicians would have spoken out by now? You bet they would have reported it.<br />After decades of knowing about this, we have NOTHING. In the age of the internet, when news spread with lightening speed across the globe, we have nothing except for a few anecdotes from people whom you may believe or not. The value of their statements, and that includes Bettie Eadie's books, is not more and not less that the \\"endorsements\\" for weight loss products posted on websites of obscure weight loss products. Sure, \\"John H from Texas\\" lost 20 lb by eating blabla product....Cool! Yeah! Face it, hope sells, and so some people make up nice happy stories that give people hope - yes, it sells, yes it sells. Hope sells.<br />And so, my strongest arguments are: no scientific proof and nothing has come of it after a few decades or attempted research. You want to believe in fiction despite this? Ask yourself why? What do you need, what are you looking for/ Which fear or anxiety are you calming with this belief? That at least may advance you knowledge about yourself.rguments are: no scientific proof and nothing has come of it after a few decades or attempted research.

0670023329|5.0|All I can say is, \\"Wow!\\"  This book was an eye-opener.  I thought I had a fair understanding of what went on in closed countries, but this first-hand account (organized somewhat like a memoir) shocked me.  Hard to believe I was so naive to think that human rights violations on this scale were a thing of the past.  It not only shocked me to know this was happening, it saddened me to know that I live in a world that doesn't give it much attention ... that we'd rather focus our time and effort on arguing about the past than being actively engaged in what's going on now.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I couldn't put it down.  I'm not a fast reader but I finished this book in a week. Definitely a must read!
B007C3TVNA|4.0|This movie version of the best-selling book of the same title by Lionel Shriver is fairly faithful to the book, always accepting the fact that no length of movie can achieve what a book does. That said, the screenplay is excellent, the acting superb and I thought the device for transitions between past and present was cleverly executed. The movie was as thought-provoking as the book.

1409136612|5.0|Full House is a novella by Maeve Binchy in the Quick Reads series. The story centres on Dee and Liam Nolan, residents of St. Jarlath's Cres in Dublin, an address with which Binchy fans will be familiar. Dee and Liam have two adult daughters and a son, all still living at home, none of whom contribute financially or practically to the running of the household. Rosie was married to Ronan for all of what seemed like 10 minutes before she returned home with a list of complaints about married life; Helen is a teacher with grand if impractical ideas for her students; Anthony is waiting for the songs he writes to make him famous, spends every minute listening to his iPod and has never had a job. It's true that Dee and Liam have made a rod for their own backs, but when Liam loses his job, Dee decides things have to change. Binchy takes everyday situations and brings them alive with her skilful dialogue, character interactions and original plot. Fans will welcome cameo appearances by Lizzie Scarlett, Maud and Marco, Simon Scarlett, Noel, Faith and Frankie Lynch and Fiona Carroll. Short but definitely worthwhile.

B005ZUR724|4.0|Ive been playing this for around a month now and I must say its actually really fun. I came from playing WoW for about five years and was a bit skeptical about purchasing order and chaos due to it being on a tablet and only costing $8. This game does not replace WoW and isn't better but it is extremely fun for a tablet game. The controls are very easy to get the hang of and work relatively well, my only complaint is that I wish there was a way to lock the in-game joystick so it doesn't always move on accident. All in all the game is well worth the money, and is a good time waster! Buy it and you wont be dissapointed as long as your not looking for a replacement to WoW

I am hoping that this author comes out with more books like this in the near future.  Though, I have to say there needs to be a age limit to these kinds of books.  To where to where the younger kids could not get a hold of this type of book (though I know that too is the parents responsibility.)<br /><br />As far as my review of these books; I would give it more than five star rating..I couldn't put it down.  I loved the suspense, the characters in the book, I loved the way the author set the scenery.  Though, I would of loved to have gotten to know a bit more detail about the wedding .in the books..you got lots of detail of everything, but when it came down to the two main characters getting married in the third book you didn't get much detail of the wedding..only of the honeymoon..all in all I loved every part of the Fifty Shades of Grey to the end of Fifty Shades Of Freed.<br /><br />Hoping and praying that E. L. James makes more books like this in the near future because I for one will be purchasing them.  :) thanks for wonderful books..I know I was only supposed to review the first book, but I saved myself and reviewed them all at the same time...I hope that those who hasn't read these books will purchase them because they are a joy to read.

B004GTLFNW|5.0|Highly recommended for persons how likes to exercise and have little time and no budget. An other recomendation is to download the app for your mobile. Very effective exercise and very nice with your articulations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app with many features and versions. Also has multiple languages. The daily devotionals can be set up to auto-email to any address. That is a very convenient feature.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Unlike most of the movies made from Dr. Seuss books, this was one of the two including the Grinch that were really well made and visually stunning. Everything from Thneedville to the brightly colored trees and valleys were mesmerizing! This movie also had a well developed plot and characters to accompany this visually stunning scenery that gave us many laughs along with a very important message for kids and adults. It is definitely a movie I would want to own and see over and over again. If you love Dr. Seuss or a great animated film, see this movie that your kids will love and adults will really enjoy as well!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I was in the mood for something light, and a friend recommended this book as one that was funny and romantic, a la Bridget Jones. It was laugh out loud hilarious and did not disappoint me.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Other reviewers have already recounted much of the plot.  So, I'll skip that and go to a critique of the production itself.<br /><br />I gave this an overall rating of four stars because I found the movie to be interesting, engaging, with a good story and some really good action scenes.  I found that I cared about the primary characters - Renner and Weisz.  This tells me that the characters were fairly well developed and interesting<br /><br />Renner's character, Aaron Cross, would have been more compelling if more of his backstory came out sooner, and if his pathetic origin were presented differently.  I think Weisz' character could have used more backstory too - all I know about her is that she's an attractive scientist with a top secret clearance.<br /><br />The story is really good.  But this movie could have been a classic if the plot were tightened up and presented differently - too much dialogue where 'showing' instead of 'talking' would have got it across to the viewer better - this is especially true during the first part of the film.<br /><br />The camera work was excellent.  With more experience, I think Gilroy's skills in this area will improve to a level near Greengrass' excellent abilities.  Also, there's lots of good acting in this movie.<br /><br />On Rotten Tomatoes, the critics are currently tabulating at 51% positive, while the audience is at 70%.  I think the critics (overall) are getting it wrong - primarily, I think, because they're comparing it to the high standards set by the previous Bourne movies.<br /><br />This is a high-quality production that tells a good story.  In addition, I felt an emotional connection with the main characrters - I cared about them.  For these reasons, I strongly recommend it.

B00000K413|4.0|During the 80s, where superficial digital mediocrity thrived, then new band Tears For Fears borrowed the synthetic 80s style and created a rather impressive collection of songs dealing with childhood trauma and primal scream. Given the subject matter, the music is reasonably accessible and surprisingly catchy. These opposite elements luckily don't collide  with each other.<br /><br />The album is very consistent in quality. It is by no means an album with a couple of singles and a lot of filler. It begins with the rightly celebrated first two tracks, thanks to the excellent beat of the title track and catchy melodies in 'Mad World'. After a fast paced third track, it slows down to restrained minimalism with a basic drum machine and highly expressive vocals (Ideas as Opiates) where the saxophone gets the spotlight halfway through the song. 'Memories Fade' is a highlight, sounding quite timeless and carrying top notch rhythmical patterns and soaring melodies. 'Watch me Bleed' is seems to reference 'Memories Fade' musically , but has a more of a sense of urgency. The summer-like 'Change' is driven by percussion and angular guitar riffs and is among the catchiest songs in the album. In contrast,  'Prisoner' is pretty dissonant and somewhat avant-garde, with incessant primal screaming and dis-harmonic arrangements. The album ends with my personal favorite, Start of the Breakdown', which is richly layered with outstanding bass lines, pounding percussion, among other themes playing each other. This kind of song simply requires superior songwriting skills.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This started off as a good read. I couldn't put this book down. I began championing one character, then another, then I again changed my stance. And then!! I didn't  like it. I will say this, if you have a free weekend and want to read something, this is a book to consider.
B00000JR2A|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I recently discovered this album which quickly became one of my personal favorite albums of the decade. The impeccable production makes this album timeless, with organic sounds atypical of the 80s. It sounds like Roland got too eccentric and obsessed with his compositions, causing major conflicts with Curt. It is no surprise that the following album is more of a solo effort. consequences aside, most songs seem like multi-part suites veering towards progressive rock, particularly during the second half of the album.<br /><br />Groovy bass, electronic drumming from Phil Collins, and symphonic instrumentation mesh together perfectly with vocals from Roland and a female singer. The end result, Woman in Chains, is a powerful protest against oppression of women. Badman's song is bizarre: it sounds like Roland just hired a bunch of jazz musicians to do a multi-part jazzy epic. Where's Curt Smith? I don't know but this track is full of passion.<br /><br />The title track takes another bizarre turn into a Beatles pastiche. It's a massively overproduced multi-part track reminding of the best elements of the Beatles. Good stuff, but can be overwhelming on first listen. The next track, however, is too syrupy for my enjoyment. It is a quite celebrated track, but I simply can't stand it.<br /><br />The rest of the album is where this album really shines. 'Standing on the Corner of the Third World' is simply breathtaking. It is a richly layered composition with unforgettable vocal melodies, climaxing with a distorted bass guitar and an array of instruments. 'Swords and Knives' and 'Year of the Knife' sound ahead of their time, almost like 90s. they are heavy rockers with extended prog rock instrumental breakdowns. The energetic 'Year of the Knife' is a clear highlight, even when considering the high standard set by the previous songs. The extended instrumental middle-section of 'Year of the Knife' is the highlight of the album for me when driving rock is carefully dismantled and electronic drums are introduced. 'Famous Last Words' is a melodic finisher.<br /><br />This is the album to get if you are interested in complex songwriting and outstanding musicianship. Singing is also top notch. You can't simply go wrong with this album. Hey, you might even enjoy that song I frowned upon.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|I was scepticle about purchasing this book but found it quiet enjoyable. I have to admit that after committing herslf to Christian I found Ana to be a bit of a whiner who wasn't confortable with anything  and as you got deeper into the book you could see that although in denial Christian was trying to change for her the dominance scenes were I thought quite tastefully done  and the more I read the more I got into it so by the end I knew I would read the other books. All in all I would recommend this book.
0425263908|3.0|Gideon Cross is hot, addictive and brilliant. He appears to be the perfect man. Eva Tramell is young, flawed and damaged. It's no surprise that Eva wants nothing more than to hang out with Gideon, get to know him and have casual intense sex with no strings. It's also no surprise when Gideon's demons start to show. He is possessive. He has nightmares. He closes himself off, yet let's Eva in. Both of these characters are troubled with unpredictable mood swings. Their relationship is extreme highs and desperate lows. To put it simply, Eva and Gideon are dysfunctional.<br /><br />This book was recommended by the good people of Barnes & Noble because I read the oh-so-popular Fifty Shades of Grey. Like most other readers, I was ready to read another trilogy along the same lines. \\"Along\\" is the key word. I was not expecting what I found in Bared to You.<br /><br />Let's see. How can I put this? Bared to You equals Fifty Shades copycat. I read each page, learned more about the leading lady and main man, delved further into the familiar storyline, rolled my eyes with every...ahem...similarity. Yet, I was still curious to see just how far the author, Sylvia Day, would rip off the author of Fifty Shades, E.L. James. My curiosity is the very reason I intend to read the next two books in the Crossfire trilogy. Will Sylvia Day switch it up and write unique follow-ups? Or will the books parallel Ana and Christian's life again? Stay tuned for my reviews.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews

0765316994|4.0|I may appreciate this book more than your average reader simply because it appeals to three things in which I'm interested. Nonetheless, three solid reasons to pick this book up:<br /><br />If you are a screenwriter, and you've watched any of the serialized science fiction shows on television, and wondered what the characters thought about their own predicaments, this book beautifully addresses all of the goofy, sometimes all too predictable weirdness of bad sci-fi shows. Why do the main characters always seem to survive? Why are the body counts so absurdly high? If a normal person were to go through all of the events that happen in the course of a series, how could they rationalize their world while staying sane and healthy?<br /><br />If you are a long-time Star Trek fan (or for that matter Galaxy Quest), you'll love all the references to favorite episodes, strange situations, and the general universe in which John Scalzi is playing. It sounded almost as if it were an episode -- albeit a waaaay out one -- of The Original Series.<br /><br />If you were a fan of Stargate Universe, you'll appreciate that the guy who wrote it worked on that show, so therefore gets the genre.<br /><br />I read it all the way through in one reading and had a great, great time with it. The Codas are all interesting, and on a personal level they all three resonate for me personally, though to say more would give away critical plot points.<br /><br />Just a fun, fun book. Go buy it!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|OK, After slogging through the first four books and trying to keep all the principal characters straight(although, who one would consider the main characters to be is rather subjective)I've come to the conclusion, that the author has created a monster saga to which their is no seeming end. While I aplaud his litery talents in being able to develop such an intense and detailed analysis of his characters,and intruiging plots and geographical backdrop,the bottom line is: where is he going with all of this. Yes, the saga is very seducing and captivating; but by book 5, I expect more closure. Enough is enough!
0393338398|5.0|Rereading and experiencing this as sheer, unadulterated pleasure: informative, gripping, howlingly funny. We have to wonder how closely Lewis's inspired construction of the phenomenon conventionally identified as \\"Billy Beane\\"  conforms to the actual living, breathing article, but that's part and parcel of the genuine fiction that resides within every recorded biography: the biographer - for Lewis, in all his writing, is surely that - must assemble his observations, findings, shards, and tidbits into an identifiable \\"personality,\\" which will inevitably include judgments, opinions, interpretations, and impressions that are his, the author's, own. Hence this particular, unforgettable Billy Beane.<br /><br />But: leaving such musings aside until it's time to think through our own personal postscripts: this is a perfectly ripping yarn that deconstructs the National Game, allows us, I think, to enter the mind of a true innovator - actually, many innovators, including all the pioneers of Sabermetrics - and perpetual entrepreneur, a creative destroyer of business models and conventions, and - even for those of us who bought Bill James' early publications - make sense in a new way of a game we love.<br /><br />Moreover, Lewis restores, or sustains, our confidence - born of books by Bouton, Brosnan, Stump, Angell, Boswell, Boyd & Harris, James, the Prospectus writers, and on and on - that baseball remains the greatest \\"talking sport,\\" from players, coaches, writers, fans filling in the spaces between the action with endless streams of patter, much of it colorful, much of it obscene, with killer metaphors, sport neologisms - dinger, punchout, cheese, seed, \\"bat-hater,\\" etc. etc. - that make baseball talk, especially in the hands of a good talker and superior writer, the most entertaining of all sports talk.<br /><br />I treasure this one and would welcome reading suggestions - and not necessarily of baseball, or even sports, books - that come close to Moneyball as a combination of informational insight and rousing literary entertainment.on of informational insight and rousing literary entertainment.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I did not want this film to end. I love action movies, but I usually want them to stop 10-20 minutes before they do. Not this one. Seriously, I just wanted the story to keep going.<br /><br />I have greatly admired Jeremy Renner's acting ability for years, but I was worried about anyone following Matt Damon. I need not have worried.<br /><br />Fabulous story, beautifully filmed (all over the world), and Renner is once again one of the best actors around. Rachael Weiz has the unenviable role of the beautiful helpless woman caught up in a mess, and she makes the character worth caring about. Ed Norton creates a complex bad guy with layers of ethical conflict making it impossible to hate him.<br /><br />Tony Gilroy wrote the screenplay and directed it--he wrote the first three screenplays too. Boy, he did a darn good job of all four. Gilroy is the third director to take on Bourne (Identity-Limon, Supremecy and Ultimatum-Greengrass) and I would be hard pressed to choose a favorite. Like the 1st three, it moves fast and assumes you have a brain. No hand fed information here. You gotta keep up.<br /><br />Also, I must mention, when Jeremy Renner smiles it's nigh on to impossible to look away...
B001L5U15M|5.0|Update: (August 14, 2012). Ok, I am really liking this Tamrac 5770 Velocity 10x Pro Sling Back. It may not look like a camera bag, but it is performing very well for what I need it for. I carry two cameras, extra lens, flash and accessories and it also feel very comfortable on my back. 5 stars easily.<br /><br />  ***********************************************************<br /><br />So far, I have enjoyed this pack. Had to get use to the look (entirely different from the backpack (M-Rock) that I have been using.<br /><br />This is a larger pack, but yet not to large. It fits comfortably on my back and has easy access to cameras. Yes, cameras. I purchased this pack because I wanted to be able to carry two camera (sometimes easier than change lenses).<br /><br />Right now I carry with me, one Canon 60D with a 50mm lens on it. A Canon 20 with a 11-16mm wide angle lens along with a Canon 17-55mm and a 430EX flash unit all in the main compartment. In the outer front section, I am carry my 75-300mm zoom lens and the 18-135mm kit lens that came with my 60D. Along with all the gear I just mentioned, I also have some SD cards, extra batteries and my trusty camera manual (just in case).<br /><br />So haven't ventured far yet with this set-up, but I believe that when the time come to travel, and I do often, I am prepared with a Sling Pack the will do the job.<br /><br />Oh, yea, it is very well put together,

1469984202|5.0|This is one of those books that spices up a genre. Namely, the Post-Apocalypse genre. Unlike other books in this genre, Wool spends its time on the lives of the survivors. The idea that the survivors would be left unaware of the facts of the outside world was amazing.<br />  The idea of social engineering is one that has been explored before, but not in such a way as in Wool. Often times, the idea is presented as an insidious conspiracy. Yet, in this book, the reader is presented with a situation that is somewhat understandable. Unpalatable, sure, but one can see the reasons for Bernaud's actions.<br />  This is one of those books that leaves the reader with a sense of dread as the pages grow fewer, and fewer. Often times, I wait awhile till moving on to another book with a sense of sadness. To me, this is on of the greatest complements one can give a book.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Although I admittedly came late to the party, having watched my first episode in season 8, I am a believer.  The production values, scripts, characters, casting and dialogue make this series anthology a worthy addition to any home library.  If like myself, you are NOT a fan of Superman, per se, there is plenty here to interest you.  I particularly enjoy the numerous guest appearances by various members of the DC Universe.<br /><br />Specifically, \\"Absolute Justice\\", an extended episode and as such,a virtual full-length movie was particularly loaded with such characters, by way of it's \\"Whatever happened to The Justice Society Of America?\\" storyline.

B005LAII0I|2.0|Fairy tales are the new vampires. The stampede into fairyland has become rather crowded lately: dueling features have covered the legend of Snow White on television like \\"Grimm\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" and on the big screen \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" vs. \\"Mirror, Mirror.\\"  And if you're feeling really generous, Asylum's direct-to-video \\"Grimm's Snow White.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mirror, Mirror\\" is a Cliff Notes version of the original fairy tale.  You know the drill: evil but beautiful stepmother turned queen, Snow White, a dashing prince, and a mirror.  That's about all director Tarsem Singh really remembers about Snow White and it's all you need to know to enjoy this vehicle that stars Julia Roberts.<br /><br />Julia Roberts is in this movie a lot. She's the evil queen.  The evil mirror reflection that lives in the mirror in a hut on a lake looks just like her (played by Lisa Roberts Gillan).  Roberts preens, she sneers, she glares, she makes mutters possibly ad-libbed barbs, and despite taking up fifty percent of the movie's screen time has remarkably little to do.<br /><br />Oh right, the other characters.  There's Snow White (Lily Collins), so lovely and angelically lit that she seems more like a mannequin than a real person. Prince Andrew Alcott (Armie Hammer, is distinguished primarily by his ability to take off his shirt and act like a dog (literally and figuratively as he displays charming misogyny with several whacks to White's rear during a sword fight).<br /><br />The only characters of substance are manservant Brighton (Nathan Lane) and the racially diverse seven dwarves: Butcher (Martin Klebba), Chuck (Ronald Lee Clark), Grimm (Danny Woodburn), Grub (Joe Gnoffo), Half Pint (Mark Povinelli), Napoleon (Jordan Prentice), and Wolf (Sebastian Saraceno). At least the dwarves get to walk around on stilts.<br /><br />The plot lurches along with the usual beats.  Boy meets dwarves, shirtless boy meets girl, girl meets dwarves, REVOLUTION! And then a Bollywood song.<br /><br />Singh clearly had too much budget to work with - for reasons that are never explained, the evil queen has to walk through a mirror on one side and rise out of water on the other.  Someone gets turned into a cockroach.  But the bulk of the budget is reserved for the breathtaking sets, the gorgeous costumes, and Julia Roberts.<br /><br />As a kid's vehicle to pass a few hours, \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" is a pleasant confection.  But as a movie of substance it's pretty dull./><br />Singh clearly had too much budget to work with - for reasons that are never explained, the evil queen has to walk through a mirror on one side and rise out of water on the other.

0399159029|5.0|8th book in the Bernie Gunther series<br /><br />\\"Prague Fatale\\" is as absorbing as its other companions in the series. The previous novels covered a varied time period right up to the 1950's and were staged in many countries including South America, Cuba and the US. This time we start off in 1941 deep into WW11 action with Bernie now under the command of Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotector of Bohemia.<br /><br />After leaving the horrors of the Eastern Front the smart-mouthed, cynical and stubborn Bernie Gunther returns to Berlin to regain his old position at Kripo. The RAF is targeting his beloved city nightly: the blackouts, the destruction and food rationing are playing havoc with day to day life. Bernie's first case is to investigate the suspicious violent death of a Dutch railway worker. There is always an intriguing sub-plot Bernie is a master at multitasking hence he also finds himself in the middle of a rape attempt. Wouldn't you know it! The victim Arianne is a real beauty and she soon has Bernie under her spell. She turns out to be more trouble than our protagonist suspects.....<br /><br />When Reinhard Heydrich orders him to spend the weekend at his country house with senor SS and SD figures Bernie puts everything on hold and goes with Arianne to Prague. Things get hectic when one of Heydrich's aides-de-camp is found murdered in his locked room. Bernie is ordered to investigate and his no nonsense, no bull style quickly raises the ire of the Nazi brass. Trouble should have been Bernie's middle name. Most of the action takes place at Heydrich's estate, in Arianne's hotel room and in the terrifying police HQ in Prague.<br /><br />Prague Fatale\\" is a fast paced tale with an endlessly explosive atmosphere, an excellent and captivating novel. Like the others it is written in a sarcastic style with a twist of dark humour, Bernie is always portrayed as a deeply flawed but sympathetic protagonist. His first person narration goes a long way in creating the ambience of the time. All the supporting characters are equally well developed and play an intricate part in the story.<br /><br />This novel is a wonderful blend of fact and fiction that can be enjoyed as a standalone or in sequel to the others.e of the time.

0802130208|1.0|Front to back terrible. I bought it because I wanted a book that was funny rather than boring old serious and a friend recommended it, but it really just isn't actually funny.

0670022950|4.0|Book Report by John M Ramsay on<br /><br />The Better Angels of our Nature; Why Violence has Declined<br />by Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology<br /><br />I had to take the 696 pages in small doses!  Pinker has a brilliant mind--so far ahead of mine that I had to ruminate before I could digest each assertion he presented.  He gives you fair warning on the first page, \\"This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history.  Believe it or not--and I know that most people do not--violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence.\\"<br /><br />Most of the book presents documentation supporting this contention that the world is becoming less violent.  He uses 114 graphs, charts, and diagrams and employs words such as revanchist, fungible, ratiocination, and hagiographic to express, with precision, what he wants to say.  If you read the book, you must understand Pinker's use of Leviathan and of exogenous.<br /><br />I, like \\"most people\\" was reluctant to accept Pinker's analyses of human society.  My reluctance is partly due to my mistrust of academics; I know that brilliant minds can too easily create views which are out of touch with reality.  But, he wears you down with his massive collection of supporting statistics.  You get the impression that he has read everything and personally knows all the great thinkers of the world.  I was suspicious of Pinker's motivation.  Then, he disarmed me by admitting that he himself, myself, \\"and each side has assembled a historical narrative and a database of facts consistent with its sincere belief.\\" (p 492, 6 from bottom)  Pinker is at least honest and that helps me to trust him.  On the last page, he forthrightly states, \\"In writing this book I have adopted a voice that is analytic, and at times irreverent, because I believe the topic has inspired too much piety and not enough understanding.  But at no point have I been unaware of the reality behind the numbers.\\" (p 696, 3 from top)<br /><br />After wading through the massive collection of numbers and being shaken loose from my moorings by Pinker's irreverence, I wanted to know what counsel this brilliant mind might have to give to the world today to enhance life on this planet and relieve it of violence.  The writing becomes much more personal in Chapter 8 and Pinker becomes much more subjective.  \\"...the social capital of a country...is more important to its prosperity than its physical resources.\\" (p 541, 4 from top)  \\"...one vaccine [against virulent ideologies] is an open society in which people and ideas move freely.\\" (p 569, 9 from top)  One gets the impression that Pinker, in spite of the relish with which he vividly describes the human capacity to torture, maim, and mutilate (Pinker loves long strings of wordings) applauds non-violence.<br /><br />He states that \\"nostalgia for a peaceable past is the biggest delusion of all\\" (p 693, 8 from bottom) and notes that \\"a scientific  approach to human development...began to replace the superstition and bunkum of old wives with the superstition and bunkum of child-rearing experts.\\" (p 433, 14 from bottom)  In the end, he counsels, \\"Neither academic psychology nor conventional wisdom is anywhere close to a complete understanding of what makes us tick.  (p 570, 6 from top)  However, I am pleased that he recognizes that \\"social liberals are at the leading edge of changes in attitudes that eventually drag along social conservatives.\\" (p 636, 6 from top)  It is these changes which have contributed step by step to abolishing slavery, granting civil rights, promoting gender equality, and integrating gays and lesbians into a more inclusive and less violent society.<br /><br />Perhaps the most insightful offering Pinker displays is his charts on The Pacifist's Dilemma.  In these charts, Pinker weighs the possible outcomes when two competing groups relate to each other.  \\"Each side would be crazy to be the only one to opt for pacifism, because if his adversary was tempted by aggression, he would pay a terrible cost...Each side has to be aggressive enough not to be a sitting duck for its adversary, and often the best defense is a good offense.\\"  (p 680, 2 from top)  Pinker then presents four scenarios from his study of human history which he implicates as significant in weighting the square in which both parties would benefit by choosing peace:  The Leviathan, Gentle Commerce, Feminization, and The Expanding Circle.  You will have to read the book to understand these four scenarios!ch other.  \\"Each side would be crazy to be the only one to opt for pacifism, because if his adversary was tempted by aggression, he would pay a terrible cost...Each side has to be aggressive enough not to be a sitting duck for its adversary, and often the best defense is a good offense.\\"  (p 680, 2 from top)  Pinker then presents four scenarios from his study of human history which he implicates as significant in weighting the square in which both parties would benefit by choosing peace:  The Leviathan, Gentle Commerce, Feminization, and The Expanding Circle.

0307389839|4.0|This book reminded me what it is I like most about running: the alone time with my thoughts. Murakami's book reads somewhat like a journal organized, not by chronology but more, by topic. I've never read any of his other books, but this one has made me like him enough to give them a shot, albeit they are outside my preferred genres. I did not pick up this book expecting some great literary work nor did I know who Murakami was before then. It was a satisfying read, in a Zen sort of way. I run, so what. I ache, so what. I race, so what. I push, so what. I win, so what. I lose, so what. I get up and run again, and so. . . I live.  If this describes you (or not), this book may be for you. And, no! Murakami's writing is not as esoteric as this review has been. Very down to earth.
1582701709|1.0|One would think that a person of the spiritual integrity as Rhonda Byrne's would gladly donate some of her huge profits to charity, yet a Google search turns up zilch.<br />Positive thinking is great, but this is pseudo scientific, narcissistic, materialist, greedy, self-centered, deluded, manipulative, nonsense. Rhonda Byrne fools the gullible for their money - she isn't spiritual in the slightest.
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's book is truly inspiring.  It is clear that she genuinely experienced the Oneness and that is the best part of her book.  I think the story of her life could have been condensed and the part about her actual NDE expanded.  Nonetheless, she provides insightful ways to incorporate the enlightment she received into daily living, and I highly recommend this book to everyone.

0446547573|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. I love that he doesn't always write books with the happiest of endings, but the writing itself is good. The stories are interesting, realistic, and entertaining.<br /><br />The book switches back and forth between the main character's current situation and how they got to be there. It is somewhat predictable, but you have a good time getting there. I couldn't put the book down and read it really quickly, as I usually do with his books. Another thing that I like about his books is that they're pretty clean. They have some romance in them, but it isn't overdone as in other books. Its sweet more than anything.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you like other book by Nicholas Sparks. His writing doesn't disappoint.
0451531019|4.0|I'm a relative newcomer when it comes to Jane Austen; I didn't finish my first Austen until well into my twenties, and I'm still working my way through the set. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is my third of her novels, and I find myself loving the overall story but at the same time seeing where there are problems with the text.<br /><br />For those who are unaware, the story is about Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who are near-opposites of each other. Elinor is calm and stoic, bearing personal difficulties and disappointments in silence and with great dignity. Marianne is vivacious and feels everything to extremes; when she has an emotion, everyone around her is aware of her great passion. After the death of their father, the girls, their mother, and their younger sister, Margaret, move to Barton Cottage, where they meet several men who will influence their futures. Marianne quickly falls for Mr. Willoughby, a young, dashing, impassioned man who may not be a good match. Elinor is in love with her sister-in-law's brother, Edward Ferrars, but due to their shy natures, their relationship isn't always viewed by others for the reality that it is. And Colonel Brandon, a friend of their neighbor, has a secret about one of their beaux that is imperative to future happiness.<br /><br />In typical Austen fashion, problems ensue, with deception and courtship mixing in equal measure. To be quite honest, it's very similar to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", with Willoughby clearly an early forerunner to Wickham and Colonel Brandon a prototype for Mr. Darcy. But unlike that great novel, this one is slightly unfocused. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is clearly about Elizabeth Bennet, but \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" can't quite seem to make up its mind as to who the main character is. It's told from Elinor's point of view, but most of the story focuses on Marianne and her troubles, though the ending abruptly revereses course and focuses on Elinor, relegating her sister as almost a footnote. And, likesome of Jane Austen's other novels, it does wrap things up very quickly.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is clearly a classic. It's one of the most beloved novels in the English language, and its countless film adaptations are proof of its greatness. But while the story is wonderful, it's not the best of Austen's novels.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Obviously free an app isn't held to a high standard; The item would be praised for not crashing. I always like to have an estimate on when my item will be charged so that I can properly time my departure around the 95-100% mark, at least within moments of that charge point.<br /><br />This app also gives me a more concise % over the battery bar on my kindle, without navigating the menus. Very useful part of the App for me as I like having quick and easy access so I can adjust my brightness accordingly when prolonged trips occur.<br /><br />Lastly and probably moreso a rare thing, my kindle charge light and green battery animation don't always work. Which used to leave me with a dead device after 2 hours when I expected a charged one. I always know thanks to this app, even when everything else doesn't read nor register the charge cable the app does!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great free App. Lets you know how much time is actually left on the Kindle as the battery winds down. Would definitely reccomend.
1588167461|5.0|This book is pretty good, but it needs more for every day wear and more pictures.<br />I thought it would be more about how to find clothes to wear, but the advice seems sound.<br />I have combined it with the Thalen Kane novel, Elegant Casual Style For Men, because it's loaded with pictures of actual outfits I can buy online.

B007HC3LHS|1.0|I have a hard time believing all these 5 star reviews.  I am not done with the book, only 30% and will update this if my opinion changes -- if I can even finish it.  The dialogue is horrid.  The pace is glacial. The suspense -- so far, non-existent.  The alternating chapters -- flashing back in time vs present day is a nice effect however essentially the author describes the same scenes over and over and over.  Vapid girls out getting drunk vs OCD main character checking her flat door and crying.  Oh! Let's not forget the 2000 cups of tea.<br /><br />I hope this turns around. Otherwise my faith in Amazon reviews is going to be greatly diminished.

B00457X7XQ|1.0|Last year, I read Daemon by Daniel Suarez, which was the first book I've read that is classified as a cyberthriller (or technothriller). I found Daemon to be very good, and looked around for similar books. Two interesting ones I found were Counting from Zero by Alan Johnston and Zero Day by Mark Russinovitch (not to be confused with Zero Day by David Baldacci).<br />The two books have similar plots: Someone has released a virus that is affecting computers all over the world, and a cybersecurity guy (plus a cybersecurity gal that the cybersecurity guy thinks is hot) try to save the world from returning to the Stone Age (no computers means no power generation, etc.).<br />Counting from Zero is written pretty well, with believable characters that developed as the book progressed. I found it interesting - not as good as Daemon, but worth my time and money. (Reading over this, it sounds like I've \\"damned this book with faint praise\\". But the book is good, really!)<br />And then there's the other book, Zero Day. Let's see how what I wrote for Counting from Zero applies to Zero Day:<br />Written pretty well? Yes, although ZD has technical details intermeshed with the narrative, so the reader gets bogged down trying to make their way through \\"thrilling\\" sentences such as \\"BIOS [...] was the code programmed into the computer itself that started the computer and was responsible for reading the initial part of the operating system code from the first sector of the hard disk into memory and executing it\\" (can you bear the suspense?). CfZ uses a better approach to technical details: each chapter starts with a discussion of a technical topic in the form of a blog written by the main character. If you skip these, you won't miss out on any of the plot line, and there is more suspense because you don't have to wade through technical jargon scattered throughout the chapters, as in ZD.<br />Believable characters that developed as the book progressed? No. Other reviewers complain aboutthe flat characters, the predictable storyline and the fact that almost all the Americans were Good Guys while all of the people from other countries were Bad Guys. Those reviewers are right.<br />I found it interesting? ZD starts with an airliner almost crashing because the computer system has been infected with a virus. The plane survives, but the rest of the book crashes. By the middle, I was unable to read more than a page without falling asleep (literally!) or realizing that I had just skimmed over the text without comprehending it.<br />Worth my time and money? No. I stopped reading after I noticed I was watching grass grow because the excitement level was much higher than trying to plod through this book. Good thing I didn't pay serious money for a hardcover, otherwise I would be mad enough for wasting my money on Zero Day that I might try to get even by writing a computer virus and infecting the author's computer with it! :)<br />So if you want to read a good cyberthriller, read Daemon or Counting from Zero. On the other hand, if you're like several other reviewers who apparently find that reading through computer source code is exciting stuff, then Zero Day is for you!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Especially like like the checklist function. It's also<br />a great place to keep track of my ratings of my favorite local brews.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best written stories and I hope that they will make the remaining books into movies as well.  It holds your interest from the beginning to the end and some events are truly a surprise in the book. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.
B000JFDBXO|2.0|We've seen this time & time again people, classic movies that had 2 good releases only to end with a sorry excuse of a thrid part. Movies that come to mind would be the Godfather Trilogy, Home Alone Trilogy, Jurrasic Park trilogy, Ninja Turtles, & even some with 4 parts such as House Party & Superman. Why is this an ongoing trend you ask? I really don't know honestly. Well the same format applies here to the X-men triology. The first 2 films were pretty good with the second one being the best out the three in my book. While the first 2 had its flaws this third 1 is a total train wreck & isn't even worthy of being its own seperate film let alone part of a trilogy! The story revolves around the government coming up with a \\"cure\\" for mutants to permantely disable their powers or alien like physique so that the humans will be in favor. A good idea for a story but it didn't actually help to break off into a another story with Jean coming back from her alledged death from the second film & merging with pheonix. The latter story is just stupid for many reasons. For one, when will these movie directors/producers stop using insanely powerful heroes or villians in these movies? Pheonix in the comics is actually 20 times more powerful than depicted in this film so much more powerful that it was able to hold its own with a mid fed galactus. Also pheonix is a being from space who chose jean as a host it had nothing to do with her mind. & why would they kill off cyclops & professor x 2 prominent character in the x-men series? thats just plain retarded. I don't recall either of them getting killed off by jean in the comics rather transported to an alternate dimension or something but not killed off. Of course Magneto & his now much larger band of evil mutants are still at war with Prof x & the x-men as well as the human race. While attempting to Free Juggernaut & Multiple man from police custody (yeah picture juggernaut being held captive by police)one of the officers manages to shoot & inject Mystique with the \\"cure\\" which results in here losing her mutand powers & blue streak appearance. Magneto then disowns her & seeks out Jean whos power is off the charts thanks to phoenix. When Magneto & his crew finally reach Jean they are also come face to face with the x-men in which a fight breaks out between Juggs & logan & Storm & one of magneto's newer mutant henchwomen. Speaking of Juggernaut, why are they disregarding the relationship of Prof X & Juggernaut? They're supposed to be step brothers with Juggernaut aka Cain Marko having a burning hatred for his brother yet they never even interact or acknowledge each other. Thats something simple they still managed to get wrong arghhhhhhh!<br /><br />Prof X & Magneto both try to win over Jean with her new found powers & she ends up killing the professor & going with Magneto. Now that Magneto has Jean on his side hes going to official strike at the human race only to have Jean get power hungry or something & turn on him & the other evil mutants making her the greater threat. Once again the x-men & magneto & his crew hunt down jean whos causing havoc in the city &. A Big showdown breaks out & Jean even ends up killing some of the mutants. Eventually Jean unleashes some surrounding energy that vaporizes anybody within reach so wolverine decides to take her down given his healing factor (yeah that'll happen).<br /><br />This Movie was just a big mess, 2 stories with rather confusing plotholes, alot of useless characters (why is rouge on here again? she completely sucks easily the worst adapotion I've seen of her character even worse then x-men evolution's version), & they disregard simple aspects that make up x-men storyline. They even leave out some of the characters from part 2 such as the ever loveable nightcrawler. wheres gambit? even sabertooth was absent here. One good thing I can say about this movie is Fraiser as the beast, he did an excellent job & the makeup looked well to.<br /><br />This movie would have went better if it had a story involving the Sentinels I mean they are a pretty important part of x-men but obvioulsy the film makers didn't think so. The plot should have involved the X-men & Magneto & his brotherhood still at war with the humans finally getting fed up & has a scientist create the sentinels & mastermold but of course this will never happen. To This movie I say 3 thumbs down!ie would have went better if it had a story involving the Sentinels I mean they are a pretty important part of x-men but obvioulsy the film makers didn't think so. The plot should have involved the X-men & Magneto & his brotherhood still at war with the humans finally getting fed up & has a scientist create the sentinels & mastermold but of course this will never happen. To This movie I say 3 thumbs down!

B000SEIK2S|4.0|After reading Haldeman's \\"The Forever War\\", I was looking for some more scrumptious sci-fi to gorge myself on. While this book is similar in theme (space, war), the writing style is more traditional and frankly not as exciting as Forever War. While it still provided me with a somewhat entertaining read, the corny, cliched old-fart characters and dialogue often served to irritate rather than ingratiate. Given that, it wasn't a terrible novel by any measure - just rather forgettable when compared to superior works.

0817439390|4.0|This is the first book I buy on photography. I recently bought a DSLR and I needed some help transitioning to \\"manual\\". I think this is a great buy for someone who wishes to learn photography basics on their own. The author targets pure beginners in a simple, focused language and a collection of inspiring photos.<br /><br />This is not a comprehensive photography book. It focuses only on three basic concepts (aperture, shutter speed and light metering) with a few other topics here and there covered very shallowly. It is not much of a hands-on book either - at least for me. For instance, when I grabbed my camera to try some of the techniques in the first chapters (pure DSLR novice here) I had trouble with focus, and I had to consult other resources for that. So I ended up covering the entire book in 2-3 sessions first, before I went out taking photos. Then I could vividly remember the author's recommendations/techniques and even the accompanying pictures!<br /><br />As a self-taught photographer, I would say couple this book with one on composition and maybe another on creativity and you would get a very nice \\"intro\\" package.

1469984202|5.0|I haven't read a book that's grabbed me like this in a few years. Usually when I read at night I start to fall asleep around 10. With Wool I had to force myself to put it down at midnight. The story is very original with lots of unexpected twists. Something that drives me nuts with other authors is when they don't explain things or leave vague situations. Usually because the author them self has no idea what happened. Hugh gives explanations about what's going on. They're brief but they add understanding to the story. This will appeal to any kind of sci-fi reader, and non sci-fi too.
1451626657|4.0|I enjoyed a good eighty percent of Catch-22. The \\"serious\\" sections about Yossarian's bombings and the precariousness of life are can't-put-down passages, often moving.<br /><br />Heller really shines when his novel asks who, exactly, is \\"crazy.\\" Is it Yossarian, the WWII bombardier whose antics (such as running around naked for days after a comrade's death) and determination to \\"save\\" his life make him crazy in the eyes of everybody else? Or is it everybody else, who seem startled and even repulsed by the idea that it's obscene to die at the hands of people who don't know you, for the whims of officials who also don't know you, for a cause that can't be even vaguely defined?<br /><br />Overall I thought Catch-22 was full of original comic asides even as it gives a suspenseful, yet disjointed, narrative. It puts across a potent message about our tendency to \\"just go with\\" things we really shouldn't put stock in.<br /><br />Complaints: Even though I know Catch-22's length is probably a satire of the idea that novels can capture real life's complexity, that doesn't really compensate for the fact that the novel really IS bloated. Heller uses three adjectives and an adverb for everything: \\"A lissome, blond, sinuous girl with lovely legs and honey-colored skin laid herself out contentedly on the arm of the old man's chair and began molesting his pale, angular, dissolute face languidly and coquettishly.\\" That sentence has thirty-four words and, incredibly, at least twelve of them are modifiers. There are many like it. Also, Heller has a jarring habit of using the word \\"obsequious\\" quite frequently.<br /><br />Sometimes the novel's sentences swelled to such lengths (and with so few commas) that I found it difficult to absorb any information at all. For example, see Chapter 23's eight-line, paragraph-long first sentence.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I thought Milo (who is apparently a much admired and thought-about character among Catch-22 enthusiasts) was very boring and flat. I dreaded the chapters that gave gratuitous attention to his enterprise. My favorite characters were the doctors, who seem irritated and perplexed just because people get sick.<br /><br />My last nitpick is my feeling that Heller stopped short with his ideas about pain in the novel. I'm certain he was a very intelligent man, so I don't know why he railed so much against God permitting suffering when it's fairly obvious that unpleasant experiences often form (and better) people more than pleasure does. Norman Mailer points this out in a short commentary in the Anniversary Edition's back pages.I dreaded the chapters that gave gratuitous attention to his enterprise.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is an awesome app!! love how simple it is and is as huge as the screen!! really easy to use!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Awsome it is terrific I reccomend it for everyone this the best I think it is very usefull I'm not the only one who thinks this look above and under me
B006LSZECO|4.0|I just read it and really like it. It gets into the heads of the characters--if you don't like psychological drama, you probably won't enjoy it. It's very cerebral. Her writing style is wonderful--rich descriptives--breath taking sadness--overwhelming fear.  I've read two more of her books, after reading this book.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game will keep you entertained for hours.  I am not much of a gamer, but I love this game.  It is fun and challenging.
0385360169|1.0|This book can be summed up with a lot of sex, \\"oh my\\", and holy sh**. I got the audio book and I couldn't make it past their third sex scene.
B00881PPTO|3.0|...now that it is the FAOTD.  It was free on iTunes back in August 2012.  I will be updating my review again, once I have had a chance to use it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|once you get into this game it is a blast. it can have its moments where it glitches but those are few and far between.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I wasn't sure about this one at first, with the minute timer. Now thst I've gotten used to it, though, I love it!
0307592731|2.0|I had high expectations for this book because of all the 5 star reviews, I was however disappointed. I enjoyed the parts of the book that talked about her trail experiences and description of the scenery, etc. I did not like the vivid detail of her sexual encounters (both on and off the trail) and her thoughts on the men she encountered (only the nice looking ones were noticed it seems.) I also got bogged down by her endless digressions on her relationship/memories/regrets, etc of her mother. After 20 or so pages of this I can assure the author the reader was totally clear on how she felt about her mother so another 50 or 60 pages was not needed. I don't recommend this book and think the popularity of this book only comes because of the Oprah endorsement.
B005IQZB14|5.0|To me, this book felt so ironic because while Cheryl will continuously mention how grueling and exhausting the hike is, I was ready to pack up my backpack and head out on the trail tomorrow. This is because she is a born storyteller. She is able to write about her experience in such a way that you feel immersed in the hike, huffing and puffing every step of the way with her. I loved this book so much that as soon as I was done reading it, I started reading it all over again. Read it, you won't regret it!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Obviously not Oscar worthy material here but the story had potential to be better given what they were working with.  Other than that it's pure B-movie fun.  sit back, have a few laughs and don't be overly sensitive as this is a little racist and bigotted at times.  its all in good fun though and they manage to spread it around; everyone is the butt of the joke at some point.  \\"The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists\\"...best line of the movie, pure comedic goal right there.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is the best game ever don't listen to what peeps say only da ones dat say its fun bye!
0345803507|5.0|The 3rd and final book of the series was a fantastic read. Expect the unexpected!  I was truly disappointed with how it all ended, but the author did still leave enough questions unanswered where she could still continue on with this enticing story!  Something to hope for!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very hesitant about starting these books, after reading all the reviews that said it was terrible, porn, etc. However I happened upon it at the library and decided to give it a try. I could not put it down, I read the entire book in one night. The next morning I ran to Walmart and purchased the other two in the series and finished those each in one day. The book although has graphic details about there escapades there is so much more to the story. I fell in love with the characters and felt drawn into their complicated relationship. The author kept it simple, yes sometimes almost like a teenager wrote it, but I think it fits the characters perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone who is comfortable reading about sex, if you can get past that the story and the characters are amazing. If you cannot, if you feel uncomfortable reading about sex in a book, then it is not for you.
0345803493|5.0|This book was by far my favorite of the 50 Shades Trilogy. So many twists and turns keep you wanting more!  Expect the unexpected!  A real page turner!  I can't wait to read it again!
006197806X|4.0|Wow I loved this. I was a Divergent meets Matched and a little bit of The Uglies thrown in. I can't wait to see how it all ends up.
030758836X|5.0|wonderful book keeps you guessing for a long while and than still does it till the end. loved it. have just purchased her other two books can't wait for them to arrive.
0345803493|4.0|I loved this one more than the first. Less- kinky sex and more story. I better understand Christian and I adore Ana's inner goddess. The emails between these two are a hoot and I will be sad when I finish the third one because I am so consumed by them!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is really fun and I highly love it and recommend it yes yes yes yes yes I really like it
1442419814|4.0|Didn't expect to like it but I did! Just goes to show definitely don't judge a book by its cover, it was entertaining and I love dystopias like this!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This is a very good movie and with the list of actors in it and Quentin Tarintino directing I knew it would be.
B00846REIS|4.0|An antidote to FSOG craving? Yep. Is it better than FSOG- sometimes yes and sometimes no. Do I like the hero better in this one? Well I didn't get to know him as well as Christian in FSOG- so we will see after the next book but he is not an abusive jerk so that is a BIG plus. Did I like Eva better than Ana- yes definitely. Did I like that the sex was more about love than abuse- MOST definitely. FSOG lost me on some of the \\"toys\\". Are they similar- yes. Anyone saying they are not similar is not really being honest. He's super wealthy and has a dark past that causes him not to have healthy committed relationships- oh and he looks like a god. She is a recent college grad at a low level job who is trying to make it in the real world, oh and she lives with her besets bestie in the world and there is a jealous old flame of his- see this does sound marginally familiar, agree?<br /><br />She can't stand to be away from him- but the more interesting thing is that Eva has a dark past and that is why she is drawn to Gideon whereas in FSOG Ana is a masochist who likes to be abused making her less understandable and more like an idiot in my book. Do I have a problem that they are similar- NO. Twilight is similar to earlier works as I have pointed out before and many, many mysteries and romance novels are VERY similar. It is tough to find something truly original and that is why the Harry Potter's of the world stand out. Even my beloved Hunger Games was not original- it was very similar to the Japanese movie Battle Royale which came years before the book. But I digress.<br /><br />In the end, I don't fault the author for any similarities. I think her characterization of Eva and Cary is much better than Ana and Katie in FSOG; however I hope to know Gideon better in the next book to connect better with him. Biggest flaws in the book? Really understanding Gideon and that Eva needed to be broken more. With her past, I expected her to have real moments of brokenness and for the author to take me into that darkness to really connect with her and for Gideon to lift her out of it. Lets face it- no one would be that essentially mentally healthy after what she went through even with years of therapy and Gideon's past should have made her past come to the surface again.<br /><br />Bottom Line- I enjoyed it and I will wait to do a battle of the series until this one is complete, but I am really looking forward to Crossfire Book 2to take me into that darkness to really connect with her and for Gideon to lift her out of it. Lets face it- no one would be that essentially mentally healthy after what she went through even with years of therapy and Gideon's past should have made her past come to the surface again.<br /><br />Bottom Line- I enjoyed it and I will wait to do a battle of the series until this one is complete, but I am really looking forward to Crossfire Book 2
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was one of my favorites! I read this book in 4 days where I usually have a book for a couple weeks. I stayed up \\"one more chapter\\"ing until 3 am everyday, I strongly suggest you give the book a try. The author writes the characters so well you feel like you have them figured out, then you get hit with a major twist! If you like mystery, thrill and love, you will love Gone Girl!
0439023513|4.0|I am glad of the way this series ended, and I even cried at the end. However, I did not think this book was as good as the other two. With the other two I wanted to stay up all night finishing them and seeing where they ended up, not so much with this one. In fact it took me the better part of 2 weeks when it probably should have taken a couple of days. I didn't like seeing Katniss an emotional wreck all the time- afterall that is why we love her because she can handle anything. The Katniss of the old books would have charged in and gotten Peeta and not waited weeks or months. But all in all I will miss the characters I have come to love, and I am almost deflated that it is all over.<br /><br />The one thing that we are all missing is if she ever sees Gale again or has contact with him....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun app. you should get it. kids would like it and adapts would. it is fun to do when your bord.
034580404X|4.0|I really liked this. I want to take Christian and cuddle away all his demons! It is definitely Twilight for the experienced set. I bet I blushed a dozen times reading this! I immediately started the second one and finished it the next day. I think #2 is the best book of the three, and that #3 is my least favorite- not that I haven't enjoyed them all. They consumed me.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is an ok game. It passes the time when you're bord. I give it a 4 stars . Try it you might like it.
0345803507|3.0|I didn't like it as much as the first two, but I applaud the author for trying to take these characters into a real storyline rather than just- I love you, I hate you, Let's have sex, now let's fight again of the other two.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Whenever I want to just sit back and have a little fun I open up this game and play for hours.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all time. This season is no exception and continues how I met your mother's excellent integration of events past and future to add fantastic layers of complexity to a simple, fun, and easy to enjoy show.
0553386794|5.0|I must say the book is wonderful. I would recommend this to anyone who loves fantasy novels. My friend said it is like a mix between Lord of the Rings and The Sopranos. I think that is one of the best ways to put it.

B008N1V11U|4.0|This game is very fantastic with great graphics so naturally it would needs lot of space. But 7$,Really? I had to delete way more than half of my apps to download it!!! I would ask gameloft to stop making their games to take up so much space. this one takes 700mb!!! Asphalt 6, Total Mayhem, The Amazing Spider-man all take up so much space!! I do think it was worth having to delete so much but only because this game is as good as Arkham Asylum is on the Xbox.
B000I186FW|2.0|This really looked like my kind of movie: a bleak, repressive future with a strange anti-hero protagonist. Unfortunately, the future just didn't look all that bleak, and the protagonist was not very compelling.<br />While there is some gratitous violence carried out by government thugs, the people in this dsytopian future seem more bored than repressed. The future is dark, but it lacks the grittiness and character of such movies as Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, or even Brazil.<br />The protagonist remains too much a mystery and there are too many unexplained and unlikely details about his life to make him a believable character. And it is really hard to identify with a character in a mask. Even the best actor can't express much emotion using only a muffled voice.<br />The female costar also has issues of believability and motive. Her actions seem driven soley by the plot. Similarly, the character of the hard-working cop is such a plot driven role, he actually seems bored with the whole affair. And for a plot-driven movie, there are several holes big in it big enough to drive a truck through.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good strategy and game play. keeps the kids occupied for hours and hours. needs better explanation on use of special item's
B004UHF5MW|4.0|This album owns except for one thing - It just needs Remixed and Remastered.<br />All the Atlantic Records years Testament Albums could use this But, especially this one ! Other than that, Alex and Eric are smoking on Guitar and Chuck is showing again why He is My Favorite Thrash Vocalist !<br />It's Criminal why the Atlantic years of Testament is just plain forgotten when You see even the Most obscure Bands getting Deluxe Remaster versions of thier 80's Releases !!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|As the product description explains, the case is polycarbonate (an impact and scratch resistant PLASTIC) which has been rubberized on the outside, and the cover is a soft fabric (rubberized with a felt layer on the inside).<br /><br />I paid only $29.99 for a \\"NEW\\" one as opposed to other reviews which says it was expensive.  I ordered it at the same time with my Kindle Fire and I was looking for the \\"lightest\\" yet durable material.  It fits my needs and the purpose for which I had been using it.  The Stand function does not work on uneven surfaces but always work on a hard and flat surface.  I believe it was worth it and I will recommend it to others.  Been using it since July 16, 2012 and it is still looking good.
1932735410|5.0|I've cleared the exam just a couple of hours ago with proficiency in Planning, Executing, and M&C domains and moderate proficiency in Initiating and Closing domains. This book has been [almost] the only source I used during my preparation. I also used PMBOK from time to time for reference purposes. It took about 2 months to study for the exam. During these 2 months, I guess I studied 4 to 5 days each week, a few or a couple of hours in each study day.<br /><br />One of the most common criticisms for Rita's book is its sometimes judging tone towards the reader and continuous marketing of the author's other products might be considered another mood killer and I believe these are perfectly understandable. But if or when you can ignore or play down those -in my opinion, minor- issues you start to see that what you have or are reading is actually a very solid PMP preparation tool. Rita's book is not simply a re-written [to be more readable] PMBOK. It, throughout all the pages, not only gives you a huge load of information, concepts and theories but also tries to have you gain an ideal attitude and approach towards project management profession and for all knowledge areas and domains. And this attitude is what PMI will be cruelly questioning in its 4-hour exam. Most of the candidates will be able to answer simple, definition- or formula-based exam questions whether they used a good book or not in their preparations but the difference Rita's book makes will prove beneficial when you see questions which, at first, can hardly be decoded.<br /><br />I also had a chance to review books by Andy Crowe and Kim Heldman prior to my prep phase. Are they valuable resources written by respected authors? I guess they are. Are they simpler to read, does the information seem more clearly laid out? Absolutely. Can there be candidates who can find them relatively more useful or accessible? Yes. But, when it comes to right information presented in not-so-perfect way vs PMBOK information presented in a great way I personally always prefer the former.<br /><br />Get the book. Start reading and try to understand new concepts, information, and interactions of knowledge areas and domains (process groups). Chapter 3 of Rita does a great job explaining the logic of process groups before it starts throwing knowledge areas to your comprehension. Take notes or highlight with a marker during your first pass. In your second pass focus on your notes or highlighted sections. Solve the tests at the end of each chapter. Chances are that, following a relatively quicker third pass and revisiting test questions, you would be quite ready for the exam. You may also find it useful to solve a sample full exam simulation(s) but I did or can not do that since my attention span is not that long, I opted to save my energy and concentration for the exam :) But if you do solve a simulation exam make sure it comes from an established, trustworthy source.<br /><br />Finally, be patient and relax during your exam preparation (during the exam too). If you are not experienced in management, quality, project management, etc, there may be dozens of new information or concepts for you there but with patience, perseverance and a good resource like this book you will very likely be in good shape for the exam...

1449314287|5.0|All-in-all this is an invaluable tool for the MySQL database developer and is highly recommended.  A must for the reference shelf of any serious DBA, it is also suitable to use as a textbook for advanced programming classes in MySQL.  Easy to understand and well-written.<br /><br />This book appears to be the result of the accumulative experiences of three premiere experts in the field of database administration - MySQL style.  It is written is such a way that a MySQL application developer can self-teach himself numerous ways to optimize application performance and the system operating performance as well.  They do this by training you to understand the internal workings of MySQL.  Very in-depth, yet written so that one that is beginning database development (i.e. knows something about MySQL) can easily understand and be appreciate of the teachings contained throughout this book, many of which are actual case studies that any Database Administrator can use to gain expertise in monitoring his/her own database.<br /><br />The first half of the book is dedicated to reference material that instructs you in how to benchmark your server.  This will provide limitless gains in not only profiling server performance but also provide performance indicators for any architectural design changes you make to your database.  This subject is expanded with a thorough discussion of data types and table design (3 chapters) followed by a chapter covering the advanced features of MySQL that details the performance gains available for one who knows how to think like MySQL.<br /><br />The second half of the book deals with the more technical aspects of database processing with MySQL.  Included are tools to discover your system's limiting factor(s) and any bottlenecks; when to use fast CPUs, when to use more CPUs and also includes an in-depth look at pros and cons of types of durability of specific kinds of hard drives.  The authors take a couple of chapters to analyze differing types of hard drive devices, Flashcache or Solid State for instance, how to choose them and then code for Replication.  Also included is an in-depth guide to designing with RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks).  Going from there on to the scaling capabilities of MySQL and then using MySQL as a cloud computing option (a chapter on each) which are followed by a chapter on application-level optimization (of course!  You now know server, os, hardware, and MySQL optimization!).<br /><br />The book ends with a chapter on backup and recovery and another on tools for MySQL users.  I suggest reading the tools chapter anytime if you start to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of knowledge and information contained with these pages.  This chapter is full of links for tools to interface with the server and monitor your application - the reason why you're so interested in this book!<br /><br />Reviewed by Joy King<br />Was previously a DBA in the Air Force (a decade or so ago!), now back in school upgrading her computer skills, concentrating mostly on Database Programming - also including Web Design.rd drive devices, Flashcache or Solid State for instance, how to choose them and then code for Replication.

I use it frequently. it has numerous sound, time, and snooze options. I like it. isn't as good as getting an actual alarm clock, but still works very well. :)

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has an imagination that is almost frightening.  I was in such thrall reading this book that I was depressed when I came to the end. She uses a literary style in this book that I normally do not care for - the chapters alternate voices - but in this case it not only worked, but the book probably would not have been nearly as effective and gripping if written in another style. Her character development is deep and complex, and is at the crux of the novel. I can highly recommend this book, and I am anxious to read her other books, although I will have to restrain myself until I get a little work done, because if they are as absorbing as Gone Girl was, once I start Sharp Objects - the next one on my list - I will do nothing else until I finish it.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|Total disappointment from the campy fun series on television. Could have been great but the writers really let us down.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I used Accuweather prior to discovering Weather Live.  WL is beautiful in comparison with subtle animated backgrounds and smooth controls. It does a good job putting all the info you need on one screen without needing to click buttons or swipe menus.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Recommended for purchase. Got this as FAOTD and I can say its worth paying for if you like Quell. It is much more fast paced than Quell and I believe it is somewhat harder. I found Quell easy, but I took my time. Here on the harder levels you have to determine the solution path before you start or think on your feet.

If your looking for a good book to read look no further, it was all that and then some. :o)

0451209338|3.0|I was inspired to begin reading the Gabriel Allon series when I recently heard Alan Cheuse's enthusiastic review of \\"The Fallen Angel\\" on NPR. Wanting to begin at the beginning as I have with series by many other authors, I checked \\"The Kill Artist\\" out of our local library with great expectations. While I do agree with other reviewers that the story is well plotted and I appreciate Silva's presentation of both sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, I was not sufficiently engaged by the narrative to care about the characters beyond whether the protagonists would win or lose. In the end, I won't continue reading the series until other wells have run dry.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I became intersted in Craig Johnson's work when I found the Longmire series on the television. I looked him up on my Kindle and haven't looked back. I read this book every chance as I have it availible on my smartphone. The mystery starts out on the first page and Craig keeps you hooked on every page after that. You won't go wrong picking up this book and reading.
0316017930|3.0|I will start off and say that the book is good, I went through it in three short sittings; it moves along at a fast pace. The overall thesis of the book is that success is a series of events, many being out of the hands or set in motion by someone other than the person they effect such as when and where one is born. I largely agree with this but would add that it takes the right kind of person to still see it through or tie it all together or to have the mental and emotional stability. (for that, please read Deep Survival by Laurence Gonzales which shows that all the training in the world or the person 'born for a event' don't always make it) That brings me to the title of the book, outliers. If you are looking for a book about people way out on the fringe that beat all odds and are successful despite all things - this is NOT that book. A more appropriate title would be, 'Right Place, Right Time' as Gladwell works through his thesis showing how events have basically set people up for success. The section on hockey and 10,000 Hours are well worth it. Gladwell ends the book with a personal look at his own family tree, which though a bit slow is a nice addition. Altogether it is a fascinating read that really shoots down things like someone being a 'natural' at sports or having a 'knack' for computers.

B004GJXQ20|5.0|If there's one thing I hate, It's a fantasy novel where the cruel, vicious, epitome of evil, is defeated by a just,noble,strong,young hero, who swears honorably to slay the villan because they either... A:killed the hero's family.B:Stolen the hero's throne,or C:Because the villan has oppresed the hero's people. Harry Potter,I am speaking to you! Game of Thrones tookthese expectations,stepped on them,ground them into dust,and burned the dust away.In this series you can never tell who's on what side and in every book everyone betrays everyone else. Evil and good do not exist. Just, noble, honorable, heroes come forth to challenge their foes bravely...  And die. Nobody can tell anyone anything. While other authors won't even touch their main characters, George R.R Martin tortures them, rapes them, exiles them, maims them, breaks them, enslaves them, infects them with plagues, or, if they're really lucky, kills them! But the best thing for me is this: There is NO MAGIC.That's right, no magic. Well,very little magic. And it is dark and unreliable. Now, if someone gets a booboo, they don't get &#34;ancient spells&#34; to save them.All in all, great book!5/5

B006YXTRHY|2.0|I had waited to see this movie, had a little time, got all ready to watch, and it would not download. Tried several times-no luck. Still waiting to see movie.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|With kids movies I generally watch with one eye on the screen and one eye on the kids' reactions.  My children (4 and 7) enjoyed the movie.  It produces an even amount of laughter, pathos, and relief with the \\"happy ending\\", a visual reminiscent of Wall-E.  The bears are cute, the colors pop on the screen, and my boy in particular enjoyed the \\"physical\\" humor.  It has a place on the shelf, and long term, it will probably end up in the second tier of movies on the shelf, the one under the Pixar films.

030758836X|1.0|I love a good mystery.  This wasn't one.  As a matter of fact it sounded like a defense lawyers dream for Drew Peterson, whose fourth wife is still missing while he is on trial for the murder of his third wife.  It is disgusting in dwelling on the sick mind of a missing woman and hardly the making of a good mystery. The one star is for the writing ability of the author, who may be able to write a good book in the future, but this is not it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|When I was given the opportunity to review Beautiful Disaster I hesistated for just a minute, because it is not the typical book I usually read or review.<br /><br />But the polar opposite characters Abby and Travis peaked my interest, and the rest ... is history.<br /><br />I started reading Beautiful Disaster the day before I was scheduled to leave on a flight.  I thought I would read for just a \\"little bit\\", and at 2 am, finally forced myself to go to bed.<br /><br />Despite my needing to pack, I found myself still reading the next day and finished the book less than 24 hours later (and I still made my flight).<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster will grab you from the very beginning and won't let you go until you put the book down.  It was an easy read, and very entertaining.<br /><br />Abby has run away from her past, and decides to go to college in a small town where she meets Travis.  Travis is notorious for his \\"one night stands\\" and his lack of commitment to any woman.  They meet, quite by accident, at an illegal fighting party at school, and soon realize that Travis is the cousin of Abby's best friend's boyfriend.  And, oh by the way, they are roommates.<br /><br />While other girls drool over and try to attract Travis, Abby seems to be impervious to his charm.  As a result, Travis wants to spend more time with Abby, and so devises a bet.  If she wins, Travis has to remain abstinent for a month.  If Travis wins, Abby has to live in his apartment for a month.<br /><br />Travis wins, and sets into motion an incredible month where emotions run wild, and tempers flare.  Abby isn't backing down, and refuses to be seduced by Travis, which only makes him try harder.<br /><br />What happens at the end of the month?  And what about when Abby's past catches up to her?  Or when Abby and Travis nearly get killed?  You'll have to read Beautiful Disaster to find out.  Just don't start reading the day before you are leaving for a trip and have a million things to do!  Trust me...they won't get done.<br /><br />Although Beautiful Disaster is not my typical type of book, I did enjoy it thoroughly!  Just keep in mind that it is a work of fiction and the author does stretch your imagination and perhaps what you would agree on morally or behaviorally within the book.<br /><br />I received this book for free from Simon & Schuster, Inc. for this review. My opinions are my own.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is so fun! great job glue. what I like about it most is you don't HAVE to buy anything to play the game like in most glu games. my favorite app on my kindle.
0375836675|5.0|I was rather nervous about reading this book.  The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is one of my all time favourite reads and a book that made me quite emotional, so I was nervous to read another book by this author and be disappointed in some way.  Would this somehow lessen my experience of The Book Thief!?  Charity shop Karma played it's role as this book, in perfect condition, jumped out at me for $2 at the Humane society thrift store.  How could I resist a  great book and helping out poor animals.<br /><br />This book is not The Book Thief but it did not disappoint in any way.  Even when writing about serious subjects this author did not fail to inject humour that really worked for me.  The same formula of a serious main story with a novel approach to telling it.  This was done in four sections, respresenting the Ace of each suit of cards and within each section a number of different lengths of chapters each with it's own succinct yet perfect heading.<br /><br />This was a book that just kept me reading and reading.  In fact, I think I ended up reading it so fast that I need to read it all over again just to make sure I appreciated every last bit of it.<br /><br />A book that has put this author on my list of favourite authors as well as favourite books. 5 out of 5 stars.

0525478817|5.0|Literally.<br />I love John Green books to begin with, but I think perhaps this is his best work to date. It was wonderful to step out of the guys' shoes and read a book narrated by a girl this time around. It was wonderful to fall in love through her eyes with someone as absolutely amazing and enduringly intelligent and charismatic as Augustus Waters.<br />I laughed.<br />I cried.<br />I snorted.<br />I let out an uncontrollable laugh every time I read \\"the Literal Heart of Jesus\\" and I absolutely loved the intricate, yet understandable verbatim of the characters.<br />I will recommend this book for ever and for always.
0307716511|1.0|SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />This book just stretched on and on and on.  And the ending didn't even make it worth finishing.  Finally when you get to the action part, you realize she is completely crazy and the letter she has been writing to her sister isn't really a letter but an inner monologue with herself in the form of a letter to her dead sister.<br /><br />I can't believe this book was on my library's Readers Choice ballot.  HORRIBLE!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This is an excellent book, following the other two in the series. I am in the middle of reading the book and it is really great.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I hadn't heard of this production until just two weeks ago. How could I have missed this? I read the reviews and, not knowing much about it other than it is fantastic, I bought it. I watched it all yesterday and part of it again today...I was not disappointed. The character development is excellent as both John Thornton and Margaet Hale learn and change from their experiences. And the actors are wonderful. I highly recommend this set; you won't regret it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I don't usually think in terms of connections but this game forces you to do so.  After playing it a while I could return to the puzzles I could not solve and solve them easier.

0345803507|5.0|I love this book. i would recommend this book to anyone. This book keeps you wanting to read more you could never get enough.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Like most other readers, I really liked Cloud Atlas.  I couldn't decide whether I liked the Russian Doll format until I finished the book - as the Robert Frobisher character admits in one of the stories, it is \\"gimmicky\\", but it worked for me :-) The layout is six stories loosely nested inside each other in temporal order; each story is suspended midway through, \\"pushes\\" its ending onto the ending stack, and yields to the next story inside the russian doll; the last story goes all the way through to the end, and then the endings are popped off the stack one by one until the doll is assembled again.<br /><br />Mitchell's style changes dramatically between stories, faithful to the temporal and physical setting of each story. This was disorienting at times but I felt like it made the storytelling more credible. Four of the stories are set over the last two centuries, while the last two describe a dystopic future which is implied to be the logical conclusion of pure, unchecked Capitalism (the \\"Corpocracy\\"), and the inevitable decline of human civilization that follows.<br /><br />The theme of reincarnation and karma (which appears to be a cornerstone of the Wachowski's movie adaptation), while present, didn't seem to be Mitchell's point. Rather, his manifesto for the book is that any society based on a social and/or economic class system will inevitably lead to decline because it is based on the repression of each class by its superior one, and ultimately that kind of society consumes itself when it runs out of people to enslave and natural resources to poison. Further, he implies that the Randian argument that our progress as a human race can only be sustained through technological advance is vacuous - without the proper moral code, we simply create more sophisticated ways for the powerful to enslave the powerless but still suffer the same inevitable decline.<br /><br />Mitchell alludes to this aforementioned moral code in a couple of places in the book (e.g. Sonmi's \\"Declarations\\" which are cast as the \\"ten commandments\\" of a just society), but doesn't go on to elaborate beyond the obvious (it's wrong to kill or use other people). At the very end of the book, he does offer one maxim that seems to be the antithesis of Rand's defense of \\"self-interest\\" as the driving force of progress:<br /><br />\\"One fine day, a purely predatory world shall consume itself. Yes, the Devil shall take the hindmost until the foremost is the hindmost. In an individual, selfishness uglifies the soul; for the human species, selfishness is extinction.\\"<br /><br />While I wouldn't cast Cloud Atlas as a response to, or the antithesis of, Atlas Shrugged, it employs similar story-telling principles to describe the opposite point of view. The difference is that Mitchell doesn't go on to elaborate a philosophy. Too bad - it would have been interesting to read (and perhaps attain some fraction of the level of influence that Rand has had on conservative thought).<br /><br />All that said... I'm definitely going to see the movie :-)
1451683405|2.0|When skeptic Michael Shermer said in the \\"Has Science Refuted Religion?\\" debate that we humans have no free will I was taken aback. As the skeptic I like to think I am, I had to find out more. It turned out that the same night, right after the debate, Sam Harris was presenting his new book \\"Free Will\\" which supported Shermer's claim. Now this was serious: if these two respectable thinkers were saying that I have been living a lie (by thinking I was continuously crafting my own destiny), I had to find out more. How could this be possible? So I read the book.<br /><br />It is a very accessible read. Actually, there is not much more information to it than the one hour presentation. This short format is very welcome, however, but requires careful craftsmanship so that the important message does not lose depth or credibility. But Harris' book is not the case. Is not that the reduced length makes it come short in content: I think is that the main point cannot be well supported with the scarce evidence shown. I was able to extract important lessons from Harris' arguments but was ultimately unconvinced that free will is nothing more than an illusion.<br /><br />Yes, we are not as free as we might consider ourselves, but I think there are other explanations that could fit Harris' data other than no free will at all; he marries to a single interpretation without considering other alternatives. How scientific is that? How can a skeptic authority like Shermer be bought without having considered other alternatives? Now, I have no formal education on neurosciences, but I can still come up with several hypotheses on how could we still possess free will and explain the cited experiments:<br /><br />For one, Harris says the origin of our thoughts appear thanks to external stimuli and unconscious processes. Then, how can our consciousness be free to choose anything if it is limited to what it is shown. Well, what if the conscious part of the mind is an input for the unconscious processes as well? That is, part of the stimuli? If two thoughts arrive to my consciousness but I decide to focus on only one, I would then receive other thoughts related to the one I chose to focus on rather than the other. Think about it: it makes very good sense, and I get a bit of freedom. And it explains the need of the conscious effort to think while Harris' model fails to explain why conscious thinking takes so much energy if it is supposedly to no end.<br /><br />Another one: brain scanning can show decision results before the conscious brain is aware of the results. Fine, decision-making is not a process where only consciousness is involved. But do these observations really deny that it was involved even slightly. Of course not! What if conscious thinking led to unconscious parts of the brain to finally tilt the balance to one side? I would think of it as a constant exchange of information rather than an agent-observer relationship as Harris puts it.<br /><br />I could go on, and probably some of my hypotheses are plain nonsense to someone who really knows this subject. However, I maintain that Harris' conclusions were taken directly from hypotheses to facts by only considering two extreme positions: total freedom and total determinism. What about the middle ground?
B0079LJZG8|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie in a while, just watched it again, and saw the huge number of one star reviews. I read probably 15 or so. They break into two sets, roughly. One that liberties have been taken with character/action compared to the book, the other that it simply didn't make sense.<br /><br />I'll take the second one first. This a story, maybe THE story, written about trying to discover a double agent who has worked his/her way very deeply into an enemy spy agency. I.e. it's probably the hardest thing for _actual_ spies to deal with, since everyone could be suspect and not only _could_ the mole be someone you know, if you're important enough as a spook you _should_ know the mole. Probably quite well. So the plot is going to be a little harder to grasp than Mission Impossible or an adaptation of an Ian Flemming book. However, this book is closer to what the life of an actual spy might be, because the guy who wrote the book _was_ and actual spy.<br /><br />The first argument, that too many liberties ate taken with the book, is preposterous. That a character here or there is combined, or that some license is made adapting a 200 page book by a master suspense writer, is not just unsurprising but is necessary. A fair number of this crew also seem to have a terrifically rough time with the fact that Peter Guillam has been changed into either a bisexual or gay character. They mention his 'robust' heterosexuality in the book a lot. If you think about it a bit, there was a very good reason for making that change for the film version. If you don't think of it, keep trying. All of the other changes should be filed under 'necessary' or 'of little import' and occasionally 'an improvement.'<br /><br />For example, the Jim Prideaux character gets I think a better treatment in this version than in the book. The relationship between Smiley and his wife is not nearly as explored, but my guess is le Carre and Alfredson decided that could be a movie of its own. Toby Jones as Percy might overdo it a bit, but then again maybe not. There are plenty of sniveling pricks in any bureaucracy. Gary Oldman had some limits on what he could do with Smiley because he didn't have the body type (dumpy, overweight, poorly dressed, unassuming), Oldman is a fundamentally magnetic actor, and he didn't do as much direct interrogation which is where Smiley is largely fleshed out, pun intended, in the book.<br /><br />However, if you can (all the way here in 2012) accept Peter Guillam is now gay and that Smiley isn't the exact Smiley le Carre put into the book, there is a whole lot the movie gets right. The cloak and dagger stuff within the agency, between ladder climbing types. The constant problems with money the English government had at the time when the pound had been devalued and the country was still not completely recovered from WW II. I've spent a good bit of time in Budapest and Istanbul and the scenes in Istanbul feel like Istanbul and the scenes in Budapest are eerily correct, even though the latter were shot in Prague. I don't know HOW they did that but they did. The performances of everyone, from Oldman down to Svetlana Khodchenkova as Irina and Tom Hardy's lovesick Ricky Tarr, was fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch was a brilliant Peter Gilliam, handsomer and more upper class than Smiley, but who comes to trust his partner more and more as the film goes on. Lastly, the locations, costumes and cinematography are spot on for the era. It looks like slightly faded Kodachrome 64 to me, already turning a little green.<br /><br />Just watch this film, folks, and if you need to watch it a second time to get a plot twist right here and there that you might have missed during round one.
0345803485|5.0|Amazing! I absolutly loved these books. I couldnt put them down. I would highly recommend these books. Constantly kept me interested, and ready to know whats going to happen next.
B000UDNBQW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The end threw me a little, but it was a great read over all. I loved the way it took a Dickens novel to a different cultural twist most westerners would never imagine.
0765316994|5.0|When I read the summary of the book I went into the book expecting a humorous novel, such as Fuzzy Nation, however, the book was more serious than that but still had its fun moments.  I would place this in terms of serious vs humorous in-between Old Man's War and Fuzzy Nation (or even Agent to the Stars).  I can see this as being a novel that people either like or dislike rather than having wiggle room for people to be \\"ok\\" with but as for me I enjoyed it.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing this mystery game.The story line and clues are great.The directions  on how to inter-act during the game are clear.
B002QGSW8I|5.0|If you like mystery books that are based on historical events with great characters this book is for you.  This book could be somewhat compared to the Da Vinci Code series or the Bourn series. Fabulous twists and turns will keep you reading or even listening on the treadmill.  At the end of the book the author tells you about what is fact and what is fiction.  He also gives you more reference books to read if you want to read about the historical events.

Now if you are just in the market for a good book and some naughty then you have come to the right spot. Some nights I found it was 2am before I knew it. :) Very well written and engaging. I am onto book 3 and I am happy I bought the trilogy. A wonderful addition to my library.

B003O86FMW|4.0|If you have read Hunger Games, you are probably excited to read this book. I would caution spending the time on it,  even though you probably will anyway. It starts off just as good as the original book, but then close to the end, it just seems to stop and a new plot takes over. The new plot entices you to buy the third book which I think is just a throw away to end the series. This book also deals with more adult concepts like revolution, so if you have a younger reader (like 12) they may not quite understand and therefore enjoy reading it less. I noticed this with my nephew.

Theron was the only one with a proper acting job, everything else was overhyped CG and terrible acting.  Wouldn't be able to watch it again, even if you paid me.  Hope they don't make a second film.  Uugghh!
B001041JLE|4.0|OK so everyone in the universe has either heard of michael or this great album thriller.<br /><br />First Thing The original songs including the unreleased one for all time are great but the remixes... if I knew this i would've gotten the 2001 re-release with more unreleased songs than this remix crap. Anyway i would pretty much get it for the AWESOME cover but thats it.<br /><br />anyways good album
0345803485|4.0|Loved the series. it was hard to get into it at the beginning but once you find the rhythmn and get into it was a very good. loved the characters everyone was so lovable  and i liked that they werent perfect. a few issues made it a little hard for me..it's a toss up between all of the SMIRKING and the constant Mrs. Grey Mr. Grey between the two. Other than that i loved it and i patiently wait to see whats next from the author!!!!!

0316286850|5.0|I was so captivated by this book I kept it in my car and looked at it at red lights. It starts out with basic instructions on how to make up your face, eyes, and lips. It then goes on to show you a bunch of different looks you can achieve with makeup, and step-by-step instructions. There are pictures so you can see exactly where the eye liner goes, how you should trace the lip shape, etc. He even specifies what consistency each product should be, such as powder versus liquid blush, pencil eye liner versus liquid eye liner, and lip gloss versus lipstick. I tried out two of the faces last night, and my boyfriend loved the smoky eye look on me!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Relaxing puzzle game. Great for kids. Recommend adult help for younger children. I use this as a special treat for the kids to play. The youngest at age three loves Perry and the faces. And we talk about what steps should we try to save Perry. The five year old did well with help in the first few levels but doese need encouragement and much more help in the upper beggining levels. The eight year old and eleven year old love the challenge of saving the gnomes. I enjoy it because the kids and I play the game together! For the price its worth it!
1400052181|2.0|The parts of this book that actually talk about HeLa cells are fascinating. I loved reading about how her cells transformed science and enabled scientists to make advancements in disease research. I was similarly fascinated by all the discussions of bioethics.<br /><br />The pages upon pages of describing the personal lives of everyone in Henrietta's extended family, combined with all the minute details of the author's own personal experiences with the family, were excessive, and I wound up skipping huge chunks of this book.<br /><br />I hope I don't sound heartless, but had I wanted to read a book on a difficult home life, or on how many times Skloot contacted a particular family member before agreeing to meet at this particular location, when he was wearing exactly this outfit, I would have picked up a different book. I was interested in reading about how one woman's unique experience transformed life as we know it, and unfortunately, many of the experiences related in this book were only very tangentially related to the fascinating story of HeLa cells.

B0017VG69U|5.0|In 1966, the year I arrived from Castro's Cuba, Gene Roddenberry's groundbreaking sci-fi classic Star Trek set out to capture the minds and hearts of fans across generations. Nearly forty-five years later, the special effects may look rudimentary, but the plot and the characters are legendary. The acting is superb, led by the triumvirate of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley. Here at last is the second season of the original series 26 episodes in their original broadcast order. Amongst my favorites are: \\"Mirror, Mirror\\"; \\"I, Mudd\\"; \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\"; and \\"A Piece of the Action\\" on to many other adventures going boldly where no man has gone before- traveling thru outer space, time or thru a different dimension, confronting Romulans, Klingons, and that treacherous Harry Mudd guy. One of the finest pieces of dramatic acting occurs when Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, and Uhura find themselves in a barbaric parallel universe in \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". In contrast \\"I, Mudd\\"; \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\"; and \\"A Piece of the Action\\" provide a curious injection of humor in this classic sci-fi series.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I suppose we all have an Emily in our lives, be it your mom or your best friend. I watched the series by the prompting of my best friend and absolutely LOVED it! So when it became available at an amazing price @ Amazon, I didn't hesitate to purchase it! I had the opportunity to watch the Gilmores grow up together and saw the reflections of my own personal fears & triumphs! Buy it for yourself, for your daughter or anyone you want to see receive a blessing. It truly is one of the best family programs that I missed when it aired on TV so I am sooo glad that it is now part of my dvd collection!

B008JAGZDE|3.0|No it's not art and reminds you just how average the writing and acting is, it is still fun.  Eugene Levy is still awesome.  Allison Haningan is quite good. The Stifler is still the energizer bunny of the piece.  Brainless but a fun watch.
B008BM9L72|4.0|When I first downloaded the Trilogy to my Kindle, I didn't really know what the story was about. I'd just started to hear a lot about the book via the TV and on some websites so thought I may as well read it to find out what all the fuss was about. Well, I couldn't put it down! I just wanted to know what was going to happen next.  I didn't think the erotica in it was over the top, it seemed to fit the two characters quite well and made their story more interesting than just a regular romance novel.<br />Yes I've read some reviews where they describe the way the book is written as 'poor', 'repetitive' and 'boring' ... each to their own and I'd have to agree that it's not the best written book, but it still flows and reads okay.  The descriptions are a bit repetitive throughout, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the book at all.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book to read on a lazy holiday, then I'd recommend this one. I mainly read when I was feeding my baby, but I imagined I was relaxing on a beach somewhere ... it was just that type of escape from reality story.
B0000U5RNU|5.0|I was in graduate school at the University of Washington in Seattle in the 1960s. Seattle had four art theaters at the time and all showed foreign films, a rarity at that time. I became an English comedy aficionado. Some of the films were just hilarious and so much different than American comedies. I can't remember the movies themselves, but some of the leading actors were Alec Guiness, Peter Sellers and Terry Thomas, plus I'm probably shorting a few others. In any case, I loved their comedies. The could be very visual and slapstick or subtle and droll, or a mixture. One thing was certain. They were very funny.<br /><br />I totally lost track of British comedies over the past few decades, then all of a sudden I became aware of Mr. Bean as played by Rowan Atkinson. It's the old British comedy through and through. Trust me. I've watched the Mr Bean Series and then Bean, The Movie. Very funny. Try them, you might like them, but it takes a certain twisted mind.<br /><br />In any case, Rowan Atkinson is also responsible for \\"Johnny English,\\" a DVD movie I watched last night. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart. English, played by Atkinson, was a bumbling government secret agent. It seems the queens jewels were stolen and English was the only available secret agent who might solve the crime. Pity the British people. Johnny English is a bumbler of the first order. His foot is firmly in his mouth, right up to the knee. Almost nothing goes right as he bumbles his way through the mystery. And it's funny. Lot's of laughs roll out, some of them side splitters. It's an old-time British comedy, all over again. The acting was.... Well, you wouldn't expect great acting on this kind of farce, would you? Expect a lot of distorted facial expressions and things of that sort. It fits. The filming is quite good and some of the stunts rival those of the Keystone Kops. It's all a good time. I finished the DVD with a smile on my face.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I am so disappointed in this series. Not only was I so bored I would skip multiple pages at a time, and still know exactly what was going on in the story, but the ending was not worth the time wasted. If I could do it all over again, I would never waste my money. Worst series I have ever read.
B006L4MWVE|4.0|This is no Hunger Games.  This is a gory, violent, bloodbath of a story about a group of Japanese teens stranded on a lonely island and forced to kill each other over a period of 3 days or else face death via remote controlled collar.  The actors do a good job of portraying the youths' relationships, enmity, love, regret, and more as they make hard decisions in their brief, remaining time on Earth.  Not for the faint of heart.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is really helpful and User friendly to use. thanks for providing it free. I would recommend it for sure.
B007H9B6KA|4.0|When I first listened to the album, I initially didn't like it- it gave the impression that it was Garbage's rendition of what they thought a new Garbage album should sound. And in a way, I still think that's true. That being said, this album has grown on me- particularly the songs near the beginning and at the end. Some of the songs, however have some truly bad/cliche lyrics, and the titular song just comes off and immature and whiny. Still, I listen to this album every so often and can confidently recommend it to any fan of their previous works.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this game is cute. and challenging. I hope they plan on adding more levels. this game is just like where's my water with same game style. my 6year old watched me play 1 level and took the game away and LOVES this game.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Functions well and without any noticeable issues. The stock heat sink is a bit weak, but this was easily remedied by adding an aftermarket cooler, which keeps everything near room temperature.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun u should totally get it its really addicting i cant stop playing this game i definitely rate it 5 star
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i dont now a person that wouldn't give this game a five star review.......plus this game is very additive it keeped me up all night
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Various levels of fun. Very different and interesting games!  Every game is harder than the previous one which makes it a very competitive game to compete against family and friends. I recommend this game to everyone.
1593157134|5.0|This book is a great combination of motivation and friend in your ear saying get up and do it! I was moved by the direct yet kind tone Darren uses to point out the areas we most need fine tuning. He challenges and almost provokes you into action. As if he is saying, \\"I dare you, you can thank me later.\\" I thoroughly enjoyed this book and even got one for my 23 year old son. He's already telling his friends about it.

B00004U45G|5.0|I was at the Greek for the second performance. What a show. It was so good to hear Jimmy's songs live with all the guitar layers that he did on the original albums. I already owned a copy that I created online at MusicMaker.com soon after the show in '99, but this CD's sound mixing is much better. My only disappointment is that several Crowes songs they did -- Horsehead, Remedy, and No Speak No Slave -- were not included. I guess they wanted to focus on Jimmy. And just to say it again, the sound is incredible. I'm glad I bought it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|it is not the kind of book i can't stop reading. It took a while to finish. It is a nice story but it was not engaging enough for me. The best of the book is the use of words, sometimes it is really mind blowing. This is why it gets 4 stars.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|If you're a fan, this is worth the money. Jimmy took out the original LP version of Dazed and Confused, which he had edited together from two separate performances, and replaced it with a single performance. I liked the original, but it's nice to hear the real thing. And now I have both. The overall sound is just amazing, and there are several added songs including a killer version of The Ocean. Get it!
0345803485|1.0|I read this book because I had heard so much about it and because it was becoming a best seller.  To start with, I just cannot even believe how bad the writing is in this book.  I will not go into the details of the repetition (many other reviewers do and it's a good laugh) but it is incredibly unsophisticated with severely underdeveloped characters.  It reminds me of the Danielle Steel novels that I read in high school but with S & M added to up the \\"hot\\" quotient.  I gave up Danielle Steel long ago as it seemed immature and started sounding more and more ridiculous and unbelievable.  I am convinced that the positive reviews on here are from teens and twenty something women who have not outgrown this level of literature yet.  There is a lot of sex, yes, and maybe with more developed characters that are more realistic, it would actually be interesting and sexy.  These characters, however, are so ridiculously UNbelievable, it's not even funny.  Everyone in the novel is gorgeous, especially the main male character and OF COURSE, he is a billionaire (definitely a Danielle Steel pattern here!).  The language is ridiculous and repetitive and since the main female character is supposed to be very smart, I would think she would have a more varied vocabulary than \\"oh crap\\", \\"double crap\\", \\"holy crap\\" and \\"freaking hot\\"!  If you like very simple, not well written books, well, then this is for you.  If you like more complexity to your novels, with ACTUAL character development, then stay away from this drivel.  Frankly, I wish I would've read the reviews first and saved myself the time wasted......
1936891026|3.0|A quick, engaging read. The theme gets redundant after awhile and it feels like the book could have been ended sooner than later. If I could sum the book up, it would be this, 'You get in the way of doing things you want to do. Stop listening to the negative voices, don't wait for perfect, and finish things even though it feels scary.\\" A book I would recommend getting from the library, but not purchasing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and I play it every day. It is challenging and some are fun and exciting I have never played a more fun games

B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the games challenging but not to hard that you cant pass them. they are all games I can play with my son or let him play and not be worried.
B00843TZJ2|1.0|They sound terrible.  Stick with old recordings; they sounded much better.  Can't believe they're still touring.  Saw them live twice in the 90's and they were still good.  What a disappointment this blueray was.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|I have bought a total of 5 of these so far, buying just one at first to try it & evaluate.  I am gradually replacing all of my flourescent bulbs with LEDs, and so far these are doing the job nicely.  To me they appear to be even a little brighter that the 13 watt fluorescents they are replacing.  They seem to be giving just the right amount of warm light in the places where I'm using them, and they don't seem *dim* as I keep seeing other reviewers say; but I will say I am someone who has never liked really bright, overpowering light bulbs to begin with.  If you really need bright blinding light bulbs, this is probably not the right bulb for you.  So far I am using one in my kitchen, one in a bedroom lamp, one in my bathroom, one in a guest room, and one as a porch light.  I think they do a great job in every instance.  I like that they only use 6 watts, and at the current price of $9.25 (including shipping) I haven't yet found a better bulb for such a low price.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I hate to compare to Fifty Shades but seeing as fifty shades is what brought me to this book then I must compare.  I found the storylne quite similar but the smart mouth of the main character kept me intrigued.  I enjoyed this book not quite as much as Fifty Shades but I am hanging out for book 2, there is plenty of room for story development and i'll be first in line to buy book 2.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL:A NOVEL is one of those books that twists and turns and then snakes back again until the final scene which ends in the only possible way it could. The writing is excellent, and as one who has studied marriages and families, Flynn does a superb job of depicting a disturbing and disturbed relationship. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to be involved as well as entertained.

0765357151|4.0|Having seen the Heston and Smith movies based on this story, I wanted to back to the beginning and read the genesis.  The original story stands on its own, and is virtually completely different from either movie.  The only complaint I have is that the book should have been advertised as a compendium of short stories with \\"I Am Legend\\" as the lead.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|BBC Sherlock is among some of my all-time favorite shows. The modern twist on the duo is brilliant, as is the writing and acting. I can't rave enough about this show.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|I hid my eyes while watching this movie way more than any scary movie I've ever seen.  The \\"escape\\" scene is graphic and actually made me sick to my stomach but wow is this an intense movie.  James Franco does an incredible job of carrying the movie given he is the only person on screen most of the time.  Definitely an inspiring tale of the strength of the human spirit.  It made me wonder what I would be willing to do to survive (but hope I never have to find out).

B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was not as exciting as the 1st and 2nd.  I did enjoy reading it but it seems to skip a few years.  I would have like to see more of the relationship between the 2 main characters continue to develop.
0547424779|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry - Book 10<br /><br />11<br />AUG<br />I read a lot of Lois Lowry as I was growing up, but I somehow must have missed reading \\"The Giver.\\"  My newest cousin-in-law, Jennie, recommended that I read \\"The Giver,\\" and when I realized I hadn't already read the book, it shot up to the top of my list.<br /><br />\\"The Giver\\" was a fabulous read about a seemingly utopian society where the people in the society are spared from any discomfort, such as hunger, war, even pain from a scraped knee.<br /><br />Each year, as children are groomed to perfection, the Ceremony concludes with the Twelves receiving their assignments, which are similar to careers they will have for the rest of their adult lives.  Jonas is unsure of what assignment he will be given, and the entire community is shocked to find out that Jonas has a special task, with the Giver.  The last Twelve to be assigned to the Giver had a disastrous outcome.<br /><br />Will Jonas be able to survive his assignment with the Giver?<br /><br />\\"The Giver\\" reminds me, in a way, of the movie \\"Pleasantville,\\" where the townspeople lived in a perfect society, but also a society that lacked uniqueness, real love, and color.  While \\"The Giver\\" has some darker undertones, it seems that the movie may have had some inspiration from the book.<br /><br />\\"The Giver\\" was a quick read, a Newberry Award Winner, and a book to add to your Must-Read list, if you haven't already read it!<br /><br />If you lived in a utopian society, such as in the beginning of \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Pleasantville,\\" what memories would you be able to live without?<br /><br />What memories would you be devastated to lose, or to never experience?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca<br /><br />Like my review?  Check out my blog and tell me what YOU think!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is definitely an exciting book.  It's basically a continuation of the first, more of the same plus some suspense.  If you liked book 1, you'll love book 2.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This product is amazing. I love it so much. I'm a huge Doctor Who fan and nerdfighter so this is fantastic. David Tennant FTW. The only bad thing is that it has a super tiny easy to lose piece to cover the screw. It's really nice over all. The screw is so small though. You'll need a super small screwdriver. Hehe a screwdriver for your screwdriver so you can use your screwdriver while you screwdrive. Hehehe

I hope this helps (:

B008A1NSTG|4.0|A wonderful 'feel good' movie about the wonder and beauty of nature and the dangers that it can fall victim to.  I love 'based on true stories' movies and this one does not disappoint.  It shows what can happen when the true goodness of the human spirit emerges and joins forces with others to make miracles happen.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|I loved this story so much that I read it twice. I thought their story was unique. My only complaint is that the love scene was short and vague. Most of the story was drama which I don't mind but I would have liked some more love scenes.

0143038583|5.0|I found this book a fascinating account on the origin of food and the environmental, economic, health, and moral implications of the food chain we live on. It is mostly geared towards the food industry in the US, although much of it is probably true for any developed country. It answered some questions that I had held for a long time, about organic food myths, the ethical responsibility of eating meat, or the nonsense of the industrialized food. How can such a destructive and unsustainable system be the default way to provide food to us? Pollan answers those questions with an honest vision and opens avenues for discussion.<br /><br />I bought this book when I broke out of my vegetarian period of 12 years, as I needed inspiration into this new life. Just like me, Pollan wonders if he could kill an animal with his own hands, take the full responsibility of its consumption and still enjoy it. With a candid view, he talks about his personal experiences in the process. I found that part sincere and moving. I nearly cried in the episode of the chicken killing. I wish everyone consuming animal products would be aware of what it implies and this book can help them gain that insight.

B002DCPQL6|5.0|As with many of her albums, Rihanna appears with one eye covered - a reference to the Egyptian all seeing eye.<br /><br />The album included here is the pre Rihanna Reloaded version. There are no Disturbia, Take A Bow and If I Never See Your Face Again. Otherwise, the major hits like Umbrella, Don't Stop The Music, Shut Up And Drive and Hate That I Love You are here. Listen to the lyrics of Umbrella, there is something supernatural going on there - \\"You're part of my entity, here for infinity\\". Don't Stop The music is one really catchy song - set to burn up the dance floor with a sample of Michael Jackson's Wanna Be Startin'Somethin'. Overall, Good Girl Gone Bad is one of her best albums, up there with Loud.<br /><br />The main attraction is the remix disk which stretches over 70 minutes of pure dance. This track list is different from the standalone The Remixes CD. I partcularly like the Wideboys club mixes of Shut Up And Drive and Don't Stop The Music. So, party your tits off!
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is addicting and a perfect game to play if you want life-like gaming crossed with minecraft LIKE hints. They aren't copying and I was pleased with the 5.00 I spent.

B00845PV16|1.0|This, my friends, was a bad, bad, movie. Not a bad-ass movie, as it could/should have been, but a B.A.D. movie. Stink, stank, stunk. Probably the worst Marvel-derived movie of all time.<br /><br />There were hokey special effects, music that kept building to a crescendo but there was no associated payoff in the action, horrible acting (Nicolas Cage looked VERY out of place with his pasty face and his thinning, Grecian Formula stained hair; if they can reboot Spider-Man with a new male lead they could have certainly done the same with Ghost Rider), and a terrible script that made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />In summary, this was a complete flop.<br /><br />As Huey Lewis once sang in one of his pop songs: \\"Sometimes, bad IS bad!\\".
0385534639|5.0|I listened to the audio version of the book and it was very well performed. The story is wonderful and enchanting.  One of my favorite reads/listens so far this year!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Very sturdy, easy to open, protects well.  The only issue I have is that the indentation on the back is too shallow so it's hard to use as a stand. I suggest a little deeper indentation, and another one so it can stand up on either end.  But, the price was very reasonable, so worth the money.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. It is a good movie and a good example of the believeability put into a role by NICOLAS CAGE and EVA MENDES. I would call it a must see for anyone who enjoyes movies of this type. In my opinion people who like movies and in particular people who like Nicolas Cage's acting should see this movie.

B004SRNH10|1.0|A newer version of the Watch ESPN app (1.6.0) was just released on Aug 9th, and Comcast is now one of the listed providers!<br />I side loaded this new version to my Fire, it installed, but when I launch it, there is a popup stating that I need a newer version of Adobe AIR.<br />When I say download now, it redirects to Amazon Apps store, displays Adobe AIR ver 3.3.0.365, and a pop up says \\"not compatible with this device\\", and won't install. So I thought, no problem, I'll side load Adobe AIR. But when I did that, a warning pop up stated that this would replace a SYSTEM file on my device, and is it OK to proceed? Well, I'm not that brave! Installing 3rd party apps is one thing, replacing a system file strikes me as too big a risk of turning my Fire into a brick. I exited without installing it.<br />So my questions:<br />-Anyone know if it would be safe to sideload Adobe AIR?<br />-If not, is there a newer version of the Fire operating system coming out that will already have the newer Adobe AIR?<br />-Will Amazon ever officially offer the Watch ESPN ver 1.6.0 in its app store?<br />I am getting increasingly frustrated with my Fire because of these compatibility issues, so much so that my next tablet likely won't be an Amazon product.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Ordered in June of 2011.<br /><br />Friends described the microphone as \\"studio quality\\" and the headset produced great game sound. Not long after ordering, however, the headset began to *crackle* if the headset volume was low. I reduced the crackling and hissing by turning the headset's sound UP and the system sound DOWN.<br /><br />Around January of 2012, the right ear broke off. The horizontal swivel is a joint of cheap plastic. I gorilla glued the ear in place and incidentally it was more comfortable that way.<br /><br />Finally, in August of 2012, the headset began to fail altogether. The culprit is, as often is the case with headsets, very weak wiring.<br /><br />Seeing as it only lasted 14 months, I'm not sure if, at over $60, this headset is as good a value as it first appears. When it worked, it worked wonderfully. When it stopped working... I started looking at higher-end headsets.
0307744434|5.0|The plot struggles at a few points, but you're not reading this for the plot. The world Morgenstern builds is as marvelously charming as the one in Harry Potter, without copying or referencing anything (unlike the cynical [[ASIN:0452296293 The Magicians: A Novel]]). In fact, it's more striking, more stylish, and vastly more romantic.
0385338082|5.0|Okay, I've already said in my other reviews on Sophie Kinsella's work, that she is a fantastic author, and she is.  This story is hilarious, it's romantic, fun, entertaining and by the end you're definitely in love.  What I really love about this story, besides the fun romantic part of it, is the family dynamic that is really well written and played out.  What I also love about her stories is that they could all be movies.  In fact, I'd love if all her stories were made into movies.
B007EC27QM|1.0|I kept reading the poor ratings about the numbers are hard to see and could not understand why because the app pictures show the key take up about 2/3 of the Kindle face. Started think must be on phone not a Kindle. Wrong, all the keys, number, memory, functions take up less than a 1/4 of the lower page. The rest is for the tape function. Tried closing tape function thinking the keys would match app pictures still didn't. Plus, bought the app so stop the advertisement banner across the top of page. If looking for a tape type calculator this is good, if looking for calculator for poor eye sight or fat fingers not this app.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I really love Sophie Kinsella as an author.  I've read several of her novels now and I'm hooked, I will literally read anything of hers at this point.  I just wish the Kindle editions would be a little less pricey!<br /><br />Twenties Girl is a completely adorable novel like all of Ms. Kinsella's work.  The character descriptions really make you fall in love.  Lara, the lead with her side-kick Sadie are a hilarious duet.  There are plenty of descriptions already on the book so I won't go into detail but if you love romance, humor, British-humour and girly stuff, you'll love this story.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|You van audibly hear the sound samples looping. You cannot add multiple instrument sets (piano, flute, orchestra) together like some others that are free. Too many of them are the same just one louder than the other. When done right these apps are awesome and plain fun making your own sound sets that match your mood. This one does not allow for that.

B006RUJST6|5.0|This is by far the most heartbreaking, thought-provoking, beautifully written story I have ever read (and I read a lot).  I cannot get enough of this book!  Colleen Hoover is a genius.  The book is full of love, hurt, humour and bemazing poetry.  Will and Lake's emotionally charged story is so touching it will make your heart melt, you will laugh out loud and shed tears of joy as well as sorrow.  Oh and you cannot read this book without reading it's sequel Point of Retreat!

I don't usually BUY books, but these are well-written and worth sharing and maybe even re-reading. They have held my interest and I learning to accept the witch-vampire aspects with more logic than I thought possible. Entertaining read!

B0050KDG38|5.0|a DEMO quality SACD. Excellent crystal clear sound, nice tight bass, reberbs as good as they can sound. Even when the remastered cd version has a very good sound, this japanese SHM SACD is noticeable better. Important: no 5.1, no compatibility with regular cd players. And the price, well... Universal is abusing our pockets.

0375758992|4.0|Not swooning with praise (I wanted to give it three-and-a-half stars) because now that I've finished, there seems to be something missing. Not sure what though. Maybe just lack of closure or lack of completeness. Her life was weird, her dad was weirder, her mother weirder still. Lots of crazy anecdotes, and an absolutely dreadful picture of Africa, yet she misses it with her whole heart. Don't get it. I do love memoirs, and I very much like Ms Fuller's writing. \\"Our house is big, airy, well-designed, and cool, with a mock Spanish grandeur that holds up only under fleeting scrutiny.\\" She also tells a story about a 6-foot monitor lizard that wandered \\"into the sitting room where I am legs-tucked-up-in-a-chair reading a book.\\" And that's the WHOLE STORY! I definitely needed more about that!
1781161097|4.0|Always enjoy the technical drawings of a film as well as stills from the story. I'm glad they included shots of the actors. I've purchased other film books that don't seem to care if they include the actors, but without them the story will not be the same i.e. like a bad \\"B\\" movie.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this season. Best so far.Smits is absolutely fabulous!! I think the writing is always outstanding and the twists and turns always keep you on edge. I'm always worried that he will get caught! Can you believe I'm worried that a serial killer would get caught?? Michael C. Hall is a consumate actor and the writers have made his character extremely likeable. Can't wait to watch season 4.<br />Thanks,<br />Kat

Her childraising insights are brilliant but her ability to compare the two cultures is amazing--indicating strengths and weaknesses of both without putting down either.

0062206281|5.0|The Pris­oner of Heaven by Car­los Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n is the third book in the For­got­ten Books series. The first two books, The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game have been inter­na­tional best sell­ers.<br /><br />Daniel Sem­pere and his wife Bea are con­tent with their life and their beau­ti­ful new baby, Julian and that their good friend,  Fermin Romero de Tor­res is about to get mar­ried. But when a strange walks into Sempere's book shop and threat­ens to divulge a ter­ri­ble secret about Fer­min, their hap­pi­ness subsides.<br /><br />Daniel and Fer­min go down a path which they might never come back, and if they do, they will never be the same. The story jumps from Barcelona 1957, to 1940 -- a ter­ri­ble time in Spain's tumul­tuous his­tory to reveal, piece by piece, more about the char­ac­ters which we thought we knew.<br /><br />The Pris­oner of Heaven by Car­los Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n is also set in Barcelona, much like the other books. This time though the story tog­gles between the 1940s and the late 1950s .<br /><br />This book is almost impos­si­ble to put down, if you liked the first two (espe­cially The Shadow of the Wind), you will love this book is it keeps the same sto­ry­telling and most of all, the same won­der­ful sense of humor. The book is shorten than its pre­de­ces­sors, the struc­ture, which as men­tioned above still fol­lows a past/present thread is more clearly defined. In the pre­vi­ous books the thread was inter­min­gled and took some get­ting used in order to fol­low properly.<br /><br />Out of the three books, this one is the least self-contained. I would actu­ally rec­om­mend read­ing the other two, espe­cially The Angel's Game first because The Pris­oner of Heaven ties up a lot of loose ends which can only be under­stood in the ref­er­ence of the back story and famil­iar­ity with the prior books.<br /><br />I for­got how much I liked the fab­u­lous char­ac­ter of Fer­min Romero de Tor­res, which is quickly becom­ing one of my favorite lit­er­ary char­ac­ters.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I loved the first book.  I thought the second one was essentially a repeat of the first.  This one... Way too much time is spent on the Final Battle.  I was skipping pages out of boredom.  The end did not make up for it either. I would not recommend this book.

B00464CU7M|2.0|This DVD was produced poorly with no shown titles at the beginning of each song and with no subtitles for the songs.  Few people could understand foreign languages especially during the songs being played.
160309007X|3.0|Since it started in the 1990s, Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen always combined nifty literary mashups with very cool and very obscure Easter eggs.<br /><br />But with this latest installment in the series the Easter eggs, once again seem to overpower the plot, distracting from the main action rather than adding to the experience.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple, 40 years after we last saw them, the League reunites to oppose the anti-Christ.  And at times the story shines.  The anti-Christ (a very thinly-veiled parody of a popular character) manages to be creepy, scary, sad and sympathetic all at once.  His two page introduction is one of the strongest scenes in the whole Century series.<br /><br />But it's hard for the the book to keep momentum as the parodies, references, musical numbers and homages keep taking the reader out of the book because we're trying to figure out which TV character that is lurking in the background.  Even worse a lot of times it's the main characters lurking in the background so the cameos and in-jokes can take center stage.<br /><br />Finally the story ends with the appearance of another thinly-veiled character who comes out of nowhere, saves the day and leaves.  It is a very well done scene, and it's about the last character in the world you'd expect to become a bad ass, but it's also a deus ex machina ending.  Not the sort of thing I'd expect from a densely-written book by two celebrated creators.<br /><br />Century 2009 was a good read, but it could have been great if the in-jokes were cut to make more room for the story.<br /><br />And if you do get it check out Jess Nevin's invaluable annotation site for clues on what some of the in-jokes are.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|After seeing this movie, I took a peek at several professionally written reviews.  Some of the criticism was that the movie was loud with too much action.  Others said it was too wordy or dialog driven and short on thrills.  For me it was just about perfect.  Another criticism is that the studio is milking the 3 Matt Damon led predecessors.  Of course that's true but so what?  The Bourne franchise has plenty left, so let's just go with it.<br /><br />Helmed this time by Tony Gilroy (\\"Michael Clayton\\") who was a screenwriter for the previous Bourne's, the film does start slow and without much explanation.  Our new hero is secret agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner, \\"The Avengers\\"), who like Jason Bourne is a military/CIA medical experiment.  He is in the snowy mountains of Alaska (actually shot in Iceland) on a survival training mission, but is running low on pills (\\"chems\\") he needs to survive.  He doesn't know that he and a small group like him are being eliminated as a super duper secret layer of the American intelligence network is about to be outed by Bourne (never seen) and his boss from the previous film, Pam Landy (Joan Allen, briefly).<br /><br />The new boss man is Eric Byer (Edward Norton) who pulls out all the stops to get Cross, the last of his class of spies.  I've given up trying to filter through the various government spy agencies.  If you think the CIA is it, think again.  There are secret levels and layers that I don't think anyone can keep count of.  And forget about trying to understand the medical/genetic/viral mumbo jumbo.  Just understand that Bourne needs \\"chems\\" or a variant to survive.  Aiding him in his quest and escape is his government provided doctor (Rachel Weisz doing a fine American accent) who's also on the run.<br /><br />Once the action begins it rarely lets up.  Unlike the Bourne films where close combat is one of the tent poles, \\"Legacy\\" relies more upon the Parkour style of running across rooftops of slums for some of the action.  We've seen this in too many films.  Enough already.  Having said that, the film enjoys some excellent action sequences that slow down just enough to allow everyone to catch their breath and calculate the next move.  More Bourne?  I'll have another.We've seen this in too many films.  Enough already.

030758836X|3.0|I read Gone Girl for my book club. We will be discussing it next week. At first I was so impressed by the selection. The writer is very talented and certainly has a way with words and is very creative. It was fun to read a different genre than I usually do. I liked how she alternated the two main characters, both telling the story. I have to say though, that both main characters were very unlikeable. Even the other characters in the book were not very loveable. So I wasn't really rooting for anyone. I agree with a lot of the reviews about the ending. I was surprised how she ended it. It as unsatisfying and sick. A let down for sure. I am glad that I read it, and would recommend it, but there was definitely something lacking.
0761169253|5.0|I can't remember many books I have recommended via this blog but I have been sitting on this one a while and can't wait any longer!  If you have even the tiniest creative bone in your body (or wish you did) this little treasure should be in your library:  Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon.    Even before you open it the book will charm you: it has a nice feel, a different size, large type and an easy flow format.  Great to read straight through and easy to pick up for a 10 minute refresher.  But what else?    So many \\"self help/creative\\" books are a version of positive thinking.  And while Kleon is positive he is also proactive.  \\"Steal\\" is an action verb and it just so appealed to the goody-two-shoes side of me.  Even Picasso is quoted as saying \\"Art is theft.\\"  HOW to steal is the key.  After explaining how to steal the author goes on with 9 other meaty pieces of insight all designed to unlock your creativity.  Each is creatively (of course) laid out and illustrated (being a visual person I can \\"see\\" the advice while I read it which helps my memory).  And, as he confesses early on, these are very autobiographical tidbits brought to life by real experiences and real failures.    Here's a 'fer instance': #4- Use Your Hands.  We are all fabulous in our heads and most of us are quite free with criticism flowing from our mouth; what are my hands doing?  While the computer has opened up great new sources of ideas, all by itself it really is not making a darn thing.  Use Your Hands.  When my hands are engaged my mind goes into a totally different mode and works on incredible things I am not even conscious of.  I often knit (and I mean \\"knit\\" as that is the only stitch I know) just to work out a problem in my head.  And when painting my hands are the most important tool.  What are your hands doing?  Simple, huh?  Are they writing (or thinking about the book you want to write), are they creating in the kitchen (or watching the cooking channel); use your hands, they arethe God-given tools of your trade.  (My summation does not scratch the surface, in about as many words as I have used, Kleon goes miles further!)    The 'mother' in me is also partial to the #9- Be Boring chapter; but I will leave that one for you to discover.    I got my copy from www.Amazon.com for $10.95 and it was the best $11 I have spent this summer...fits in my purse and I can get re inspired when ever I have to kill time waiting on an appointment I am inevitably too early for.    Finally, if you don't believe me, just check out his website by clicking on the book photo above and meander through this guy's head for a bit.  You'll either take notes (and lose them ) or you'll invest the bucks.  Have fun and let me know what you think.  Meanwhile I am off for a long walk in the woods because #5- Side Projects and Hobbies Are Important.  ([...] and [...])

B005LAII0I|4.0|I've been wanting to rent this one but every time I went to the movie store they were all rented out or decided to get something else. I thought maybe I lucked out in not wasting my money becuase of the rather negative reviews here and other places. But I have learned my lesson on that (both good and bad) so I tend to really not listen to reviews and judge for myself. Well one night I was watching two of my nieces (which I do on a semi regular basis) and when we went to the movie store, this was in. With the PG rating it was very appropriate for our evening so we wouldn't have to rent something they've already seen or watch something at my house over and over again. I find it rather hard to find family friendly movies without the adults having to always watching kiddie movies, especially when you are dealing with age ranges where one can only watch G/PG and the other can watch a little bit more. When it comes to the age range that's too old to watch cartoons all the time and not old enough to watch the content in a lot of the PG 13 movies that come out -- even if they are technically old enough to. The older one of my many nieces/nephews is very mature for her age but it's not like she's allowed to watch anything she wants to. So she's in an awkward position at times. I do enjoy kid's animation movies but even during family night you just want to watch something a little more on your level without having to wait when the kids aren't around. Just seems like there's been slim pickings without watching a \\"cartoon\\". Well needless to say it was a great decision because my nieces loved the movie and I enjoyed it as well. We actually had it playing on a loop the next day while we were doing things around the house. It would've been something I would have enjoyed just watching on my own...and I'm 26 and not the type to sit around at home and watch movies on a regular basis because of my busy schedule and social life.<br />I think people are thinking way too deeply about this movie because I definitely don't get where they are coming from, even having an open mind to try to see why others are thinking that way. If you aren't into movies that are \\"re-done\\" in any way, then don't rent it, duh! Someone thought it was going to be the same story but with real people playing the characters. Um, did you see the previews or read the summary?? It's not like it had the same name and by the name Mirror Mirror you would think it would revolve more around the queen or something, obviously. This is only common sense. I personally think Julia Roberts did a great job playing the queen, not sure why people had a problem with that at all...and I'm pretty picky about my movies because I don't have time to waste on bad ones. Someone mentioned she wore the same dress too many times. Who the heck cares?! I don't watch every Julia Roberts movie by any means but she has the skill to play any role successfully. She's been in every type of movie. Others said the characters had no depth. Really? Well considering it's more of a family movie, I don't think that's necessary and I think there was more than an appropriate amount of depth.<br />Seems like there are people that are making a big deal out of Snow White and the Huntsman saying it's going to be so great, so what is the difference in this? They are from 2 different perspectives...hence 2 different movies. Snow White and the Huntsman is supposed to be for older viewers, if I understand correctly, so maybe folks should take that into consideration. I even saw a review that someone didn't like the dwarfs on stilts. Well, it's a fight scene and they plainly explain/show why, so I have no idea why you wouldn't get that. It's not in anyway offensive, too silly or out of context.<br />I wish this would have got as much hoopla at Snow White and the Huntsman actually considering there are 2 Snow White-type of movies coming out in a short amount of time.<br />All around, this isn't a bad movie at all. It's not a serious drama and it's not extremely juvenile. I would definitely have no problem buying it for my nieces not only because I like it but they LOVED it, and are different age ranges.
B007VT6QSI|2.0|Look, i think he does have talent, plays some guitar, and would be suited just fine to write and produce his own stuff. instead, you get like four different producers, another team of pro songwriters writing the songs and usher also appears on the credits as executive producer, i believe. hate to see the music industry machine, sterilize, streamline, and homogenize whatever's left of his artistic muse. just like is the case with these record company cash cows like him or britney spears, there are too many cooks in the kitchen to make a cohesive and eduring artistic statment. Then again, record industry is about making money at the end of the day and that leaves zero room to let an artist truly explore his muse and grow beyond the confines of what the record industry considers \\"acceptable\\". They get just one whiff of originality beyond the \\"formula\\" that has to be followed to make money and they're not having any of it.  maybe someday, justin will release from usher's paternal teet(hey, even the Velvet Underground had to fire Andy Warhol in order to grow artistically!) and go on to make self produced albums and maybe play the instruments or at least feature his own guitar playing instead of having his albums run thru the music business washing machine that delivers \\"sounds like everybody else\\" bull crap that is force fed to the masses via FM radio playlists, so contrived and repetitous that anybody intelligent will realize this cannot be \\"the best\\" music out there, although it's probably the most well known.

B0083EM24C|3.0|Return with me, if you will, to the 1980's. It was a time of great technological change in the music business as drum machines and synthesizers became more and more refined. Was there a band that resembled Passion Pit? Why yes there was, and they were called Scritti Politti, and if Passion Pit isn't a dead ringer for them--I mean just go back and listen to 1985's \\"Perfect Way\\" or 1988's \\"Boom! There She Was\\". I have a feeling that none of the band members in Passion Pit have ever heard of Scritti Politti, as they might have been too young to recall them. After all, the band covered The Cranberries' 1992 hit \\"Dreams\\", which might imply the band is not familiar with Scritti Politti. The one thing I had a problem with Scritti Politti is the same problem I have with Passion Pit. Delving into over-production and faux electronic r&b.<br /><br />Now, some fans of Passion Pit might argue that \\"Constant Conversation\\" is this fantastic track, but I felt it was seriously lacking. It came off as some second-rate Atlantic Starr schmaltz from some long forgotten corner of the 1980's r&b schmooze scene. Easily one of the biggest offenders on \\"Gossamer\\". The band needs to steer clear of this type of song in the future.<br /><br />I found myself having the same problem with \\"Gossamer\\" that I had with \\"Manners\\" and that is overproduction, weak song structures and a serious problem with the vocals. Let's face it, Passion Pit doesn't know how to reel in their production values, and along with song form, the two things make it so that several songs lose their individuality--particularly in the center of the album with \\"Constant Conversations\\", \\"Mirrored Sea\\", \\"Cry Like A Ghost\\" and \\"On My Way\\". The vocal arrangements are a mess--the high falsetto gets really annoying at a certain point, and all the layered choruses also wear thin with repeated listening. Passion Pit aren't Coldplay or Snow Patrol or U2--they have not earned their big choruses and ebullient melodies as those other bands have.<br /><br />That being said, the band's strengths are songs such as \\"Take A Walk\\"--upbeat melody with anxiety and hopeful lyrics--and unusual immigration subject matter--it somehow works quite well. \\"I'll Be Alright\\" is good. \\"Carried Away\\" is Passion Pit in top notch form. \\"Love Is Greed\\" is excellent along with \\"It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy\\"--both could be major hit singles.

B005588TV4|4.0|I got this book from the library but wanted a copy for myself and to lend out, I found this book to be a delight.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is a great game and very addicting.  I have the app on my tablet as well and can't put it down once I start playing.
0307591549|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It has the perfect balance between the academics of the real life studies and the implications of those studies and then how to apply it to your life.  Plus Shawn Achor is one funny guy!
B00000255X|4.0|This is an excellent album by Dylan albeit short. Equal praise to  Dylan's  collaborators on the album. Emmylou Harris on vocals and Scarlet Rivera (the violinist who appears on most of the tracks) bring a lot to the table on this release and mesh beautifully with Bob as accompanyists on superb tracks such as : Hurricane, Mozambique, One More Cup Of Coffee, Isis, and Joey. Don't buy the BS about Dylan's music sucking after the motorcycle accident or after the 60s. He still has plenty of juice here (and still going strong today). A worthy addition to your Dylan collection.

B00007BKVC|5.0|What can I say? This is the ultimate in bad girl movies..but I loved it!!! These girls can stir up a storm no doubt! They ruled the 90's! They were on a vacation just the 2 of them when Thelma gets assaulted outside a bar, but Louise puts a stop to it by pulling a gun on the perp..and so begins their life of crime....I absoultely loved Gena Davis and Susan Sarandon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love, love, love this book! Could not put the book down. Great story and leaves you wondering what is to come in Fifty Shades Freed.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Forget Tony Jaa, the new king of Martial Arts flicks is Iko Uwais! I am not making this up. I have never heard of either the director or main star prior to watching this awesome movie, and yet I was totally blown away by the insane level of gore, stunts, and lockjaw inducing camera angles. This guy Iko is young, lighting-quick, and can actually act, unlike Mr. Jaa. The tagline on the box cover reads like something out of an old-school arcade shooter: \\"1 Ruthless Crime Lord. 20 Elite Cops. 30 Floors of Hell.\\" This is the plot. The fight sequences are slick as hell and on par with early John Woo. Not since 2004's Parkour masterpiece [[ASIN:B000MX7V48 District B13 [Blu-ray]]] have I liked a martial arts movie this much!
1401207529|4.0|This trade collects Batman issues #404-407.<br /><br />Batman: Year One was a result of DC editorial wanting to revamp it's primary heroes: Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman.  However they decided Batman didn't really need revamping to be relevant - his origin resonated as well in 1986 as it did when he was introduced.  Instead the Dark Knight would remain the same at his core, but the details of his beginning would be updated, re-explored, and expanded.<br /><br />The result was a four part story showing a determined Bruce Wayne stepping into Gotham with merely the hint of what he was setting out to do and it's scope and a wary police Lt. transferring into the heart of a corrupt city to try and deal with it's rotten core from within.  It's well done and I can understand the acclaim Miller's parallel depiction of the problems these two men face has garnered through the years.  Both Wayne and Gordon face hard choices and make mistakes, which is the beauty of the story because heroism is not about being perfect but rather about keeping up the fight.  There is a lot of depth here, and while everything is covered another couple of issues to explore things in more depth would have been nice.<br /><br />Several scenes and elements from this have become iconic and can be seen as influences in many later stories, including the film Batman Begins.<br /><br />The art is a mixed bag.  It's decent, seems flat and muddled in some places.  This is likely because the coloring often crosses the line from grim and gritty to washed out and dull.  Odd, since the issues were recolored for the trade, and the colorist hand painted the new work.  Some replication choice must be at fault for the end result, because the story pages do not have the depth of painted colors and do not compare favorably to a sample of the in process art shown in the back.  Also shown in the back are some sample of the pages printed in the single issues, which I honestly would have preferred been left alone.<br/><br />A strong interpretation of the early days of on of the most recognizable superheroes ever, Year One isn't perfect but still is easily desrving of the \\"classic\\" label it has obtained.

B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|This is the fourth version of King Kong that I have purchased over the years going back to Beta.  The best I had seen before was the Criterion Laser Disc that I had many moons ago.  The DVD was ok...not great, just OK.  This Blu Ray book came up for sale on Warner Brothers store for $10.00 so I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a try.<br /><br />Well let me tell you.  ThIs Blu Ray is a real eye opener!  This pressing comes from a \\"lost\\" British print that had not been censored by Hayes so there is no longer the transition from 35mm to 16mm for the censored scenes.  Before, the transition was quite visible.  This print is crisp and clean.  I cannot imagine better.  In addition, the re-creation of the lost spider pit sequence is a real hoot if you are a Kong fan.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this higher!!!!
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Just got an update and it wiped out all my previous games. Now I have to start over from the beginning. Except that it's not worth the aggravation. Going to play something different now.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Jeremy Renner is Aaron Cross; the new Jason Bourne. It feels like Renner is trying so hard to make this character work. Cross is so sarcastic, quick witted, and smart mouthed. It's difficult not to like him and Renner does the absolute best job he can with the character. Producer Frank Marshall has been so adamant about a fifth movie possibly seeing Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner team up. The issue is \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" seems to be banking on that idea so much that this just feels like filler. You have this new character who knows exactly what he signed up for and realizes what can and will happen when everything goes wrong; he's essentially the exact opposite of Jason Bourne. But the Aaron Cross character doesn't really go anywhere. As soon as things finally start to get somewhat interesting, you find yourself walking out of the theater.<br /><br />The rest of the cast mostly just feels like they were thrown in to act astonished at Aaron Cross' actions. Edward Norton was a huge drawing factor, but really only has a few memorable one-liners. His \\"moral excrement\\" conversation with Cross is quite possibly the most intriguing scene in the movie though. Rachel Weisz can usually be counted on to give a great performance, as well. Her character, Dr. Marta Shearing, seems so melodramatic though. Nearly everything that happens to her before she meets up with Cross is so ridiculously overdramatic and she does nothing but cry. Thankfully, her chemistry with Jeremy Renner saves her performance from being a complete waste. Their conversation in the car as Dr. Shearing explains the specifics of the blue and green pills is fascinating and fairly intelligent.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" does do a few things right. It does have a few semi-long one-take shots. \\"Semi-long\\" meaning longer than the rest of the ridiculously fast edits scattered throughout the rest of the film. The best example is when Aaron runs up the side of a house, climbs up the roof, opens the window, gets inside the house, and immediately shoots somebody in the head. There's also this pretty great motorcycle chase that had shades of \\"Terminator 2\\" in it. Cross's interaction with the wolves seemed like this huge shout out to \\"The Grey,\\" which should only be seen as a good thing.<br /><br />The problem with the Bourne franchise is that the camera work is so dizzying; the camera tries to move faster than Jason Bourne or Aaron Cross does and it leaves you feeling kind of nauseous. \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" doesn't have an ending. Everything just stops. The biggest action sequence in the entire movie transpires, then it gives you a calm moment to catch your breath. But it doesn't follow up with anything afterward. It is pretty much left at, \\"I'm just seeing what our options are.\\" If your movie has a bigger open ending than the average horror film, then you've got a problem.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Legacy\\" mostly just comes off feeling as disposable as the agents in the program. It's a dull excuse of a thriller that is incapable of satisfying that fictitious salivating gland deep within your soul that craves heavy action and adrenaline pumping adventure. The ball has officially been dropped. Now we play the waiting game to see if anyone even noticed.e the house, and immediately shoots somebody in the head.

B00005LOUQ|1.0|I absolutely love classis Christmas movies, and there are very few modern moves that live up to what I believe is a great Christmas movie.  In watching the live action Grinch, Jim Carrey was obnoxiously over the top. and the movie didn't have any of the wholesome goodness I feel that the cartoon has. If I had to choose between the live action Grinch and any other Christmas movie, I would choose the other Christmas movie.  If I had to choose between the Grinch cartoon and another Christmas movie, I would definitely keep it in my rotation.
030758836X|5.0|I bought this book based on editorial reviews and \\"best-seller\\" popularity. Haven't read Flynn's previous books. I feel this book is best read without knowing too many details beforehand. It's the unexpected twists and turns as well as Flynn's thought-provoking process of getting into the minds of Amy and Nick that made this so enthralling for me.<br /><br />Normally I'm a slow reader, taking extra time to visualize places, people, what they are thinking and doing. I found Flynn's writing style to be deft at creating thoughts and scenes and with such clarity I finished this book in 4 days (and nights). I could hardly put it down. Flynn leads you where she wants you to go, then abruptly turns a corner and I found myself thinking, \\"I never would have guessed that!\\" She is a master at character development--delving into the darkest areas of the human mind and exposing shocking events or tender thoughts impossible to predict. She writes with such a skillful command of language, you read what people do sometimes say to each other--as well as what they may be thinking, but don't say. You think you know them--but you don't. Even characters and places that may seem minor at first, become something more meaningful--sinister, sympathetic, vindictive, weak, self-destructive.<br /><br />If you like psychological thrillers and enjoy the process of  trying to figure out how stories will end, who will win, lose and how, aren't tempted to peek, skip details, rush ahead. read the last page or otherwise destroy the element of shock or surprise, then you should thoroughly enjoy this book. I went back and read the reviews here after finishing, noting that some mention \\"soft porn\\"  due to frequent graphic sexual details, violent situations, language, etc. Though true, I felt they were important to understanding the characters on a deeper level and in context with the story line.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really really really really really really really really really really fun to play I had a blast
B005MMYBXI|4.0|Shows how violent the life of a gladiator was. Lots of cursing, sex and gore but it wasn't just eye candy it did a good job of showing the political motivations of Romans and the desires of slaves to be free. Great prequel to Spartacus:Blood and Sand.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|one of the most touching and endearing books i have read in a long time... ihave passed it on to many of my friends,they also have been touched by this sad,but wonderful story.
B006LSZECO|3.0|what a great character build up. great twists and plot turns, couldn't wait to turn the next page, and then it was over.  so much time, effort and love went into the first 9/10 of the story, and then nothing. an ending that was blah and left me wanting for more. i do appreciate an author forgoing the neat 'bow' at the end of the story, but this ending almost seemed hurried and unfinished.
B0067R0APK|4.0|It has lots of info. I especially like the hour by hour forecast. It looks great on my Kindle Fire.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|The cable I have only just received and have not had a chance in my busy life to put it to use , however being brand new all appears to be inorder I have no reason to suspect otherwise .
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I am a fan of quick-witted writing and the Guillmore Girls series was an excellent example of that.  Along with the pop culture references, the cast pulled it off with great expertise.<br />So glad I found the entire series and at a great price on Amazon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very easy to use as well as accurate. the large keypad is very cool and a dream to see and use. the 20 word minimum comment is not cool though

I prefer blue balls over yellow balls, please update so I can play with blue balls, thanks.
0142414999|5.0|Loved it! I enjoyed all three stories, liked the characters, and chuckled regularly. It left me with the same feeling that I have after watching a John Hughes/Molly Ringwald movie. :-)
1417055065|5.0|This is my favorite version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and it is gloriously beautiful and so wonderfully romantic - as a special treat to myself, I find time every few weeks to snuggle down and play and view again.  Besides the two great actors and they ARE wonderful (she is SO beautiful and he is SO handsome) - the scenery and music are lovlier than I have the words to describe.  Arrived fast and in perfect condition from the seller to whom I owe thanks.  A perfect movie for romantics and lovers everywhere!

B0070NSPCU|5.0|First, I want to clarify that I haven't read a book for pleasure for over three years. I got a kindle fire last year's Christmas, but I didn't know any good books to read. I tried to read the Harry Potter books when they were release for the kindle but I found that it wasn't as engaging, for I have seen all the movies before. After looking around for a while I found this book, and after reading the sample I realize that the price of the book was more than worth it to continue reading this great adventure. Even though there are  minor grammatical mistakes, the exigent of the story make then seen even smaller.  I am glad to be the 270 person who took the time to give feedback about an excellent book and I am also glad I found this book that has made want to read for the pleasure of it once again.
1400052181|5.0|In this book, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Hela cells and the story of the Lacks family, deftly weaving together science, social history and biography. The story is compelling, and it's very well written. Terry Gross interviewed Skloot on Fresh Air a few weeks ago ... I enjoyed listening to the interview, and the book proved to be even better than I had hoped. I highly recommend this book.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|I'm having a lot of fun with this one.  If you like Quell you will probably enjoy this too.  A good solid puzzle game with lots of depth.
B007SGM084|4.0|After all the hype, I finally decided to get the series on my Kindle. I really didn't know what to expect as far as the storyline. I read all three books in less than 2 weeks, and all I can say is Whoa, Nelly! This is not a book for everyone, especially younger people. It definitely should be rated NC17. The S and M actually got pretty boring by the third book. Maybe people actually do that stuff, but unless you are really into it, it seemed pretty far fetched to me. Other than that I really liked the books. A billionaire at such a young age, I had some trouble wrapping my mind around it, but I still thought Mr. Grey was beautifully flawed and I loved the back and forth emails with Ana. I hope the author does decide to write a prequel about Christian's life before Ana. I think it would be great. If you want to read a great series with a terrific love story, try the IN DEATH series by J.D. Robb. Meet Eve Dallas and Roarke. Now those are amazing books. But I would probably reread the 50 Shades again.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Another prompt delivery from Amazon...My first listen to Scotty Mcreery.....The album is so good...He sure will fill the spaces between Josh Turners Albums Scotty is so young and fresh he has a style  I so like.Favorite song..Dirty Dishes.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Despite all the hype for this book, I was so surprised to find it so badly written.  Honestly, I got through the first few chapters of tripe and couldn't believe the editor had let this go to be published.
0743457900|4.0|In the end, a great story with compelling characters. The beginning is quite slow, or maybe it took me some time to get used to the pace. The plot lines and cast of characters are complex. The first time I started reading it, I kept forgetting who was who between sittings, and quickly lost my motivation to continue. But then I started again, this time with a notebook handy to write down character names and bits of jargon. With that small aid during the first third or so of the book, I was swept up in the story; I don't think I looked at the notebook once during the second half of the book. And I am very glad I persevered! The characters are so well drawn, the emotions so repressed, the action so understated... It's really quite a remarkable book. I look forward to reading the rest of the Karla trilogy.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I enjoyed this as it is very much like Where is my water? This version is much shorter and easier to play. not as many levels to get through and easier to beat. The graphics and sounds in the game are fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think that the add is cool but it has WAY to many pop up adds that come up any time that u complete a level
B00628RFPM|5.0|I viewed this movie on my kindle and I must say that the download was quick and easy. The picture quality was great. But most of all the message is the most significant. This movie exposes what happened to innocent children during the Holocaust and how the evil of a father came back to hurt his own family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I agree with The Wall Street Journal's apt description of the work, as soft porn for the ladies.  Apart from that, however, the author demonstrates a degree of artistic skill that keeps the reader's attention from cover to cover.  \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is entertaing and deserving of its success.  Without hesitation, I recommend it for summer vacation relaxation. It is thought likely all the other Shades embrace comparable and commendable quality.
1423101502|5.0|The Last Olympian is an action-packed and highly satisfying end to Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series. I loved every minute of it!
B008MBXFEM|5.0|One of my favorite albums to listen, and with time I get to understand each of the song individually. It takes me some time but this is not the kind of music that amazes you the first time of hearing it. They remind you of the scenes in the movie, and evoke certain emotions from the movie. Some of my favorite songs are: Why Do We Fall?, Rise, and Fear Will Find You.<br /><br />Give this a try.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun, easy games to pass time. There is a lot of variety in the games, and they don't take much time to solve.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|All I can say is absolutely incredible!!I have been a huge fan of Depeche since 1985 and have enjoyed listening to them grow through the years. From VCMG, to Dave's solo work, to the newest DM cd, they just keep getting better and better!<br />I will admit that it took me 2 listens to really love this cd. But now I can't stop playing it. It showcases Dave's voice in such an interesting and different way. Gives due credit to the depth and range of his voice. I've always felt that DM has a 'soulfulness' under the surface that not everyone gets. You will definitely feel it here. The songs are so touching and real. Lyrically there is experience and maturity abounding, but still the questioning of \\"what does all of this mean?\\".<br />I was not familiar with the Soulsavers work before this, but I have been checking out their other music and they are fabulous too!!<br />Give this a listen--if you are a fan of Dave's, you won't regret it!!
B006RXPUR2|4.0|The film was really a surprise, the quality of the story, the acting and cast was exceptional.  Brilliant portrayal of a complicated and well written storyline made very real and believable.  Terrific twists and surprise elements well paced to make it powerful throughout the whole piece!! Outstanding, really outstanding, and Casey Afflect so well cast for this part, much better in this kind of role than his brother would ever be!!!
1423101499|5.0|Another great installment of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series. This might be my favorite of the series so far, and I've loved them all.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a truly inspiring book.  It shows that no matter what our past we have the opportunity to turn our life around if we place our faith in God.  It also is a story of awe inspiring courage.  Adam Brown was a true hero and a true role model. I liked this book so much I sent a copy to my Dad.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|People should just stop comparing new Metallica releases to the good old days of Kill 'em All or RTL.  They just aren't that band anymore.  Also, Lulu was a Lou Reed POS that stunk.  Don't even know why Met did it, but whatever.  THIS ep is fun.  It is the perfect fill in for those who enjoyed Death Magnetic and needed a quick fix until their next album.  While IMO \\"Hate Train\\" is by far the best piece on the ep (think \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" meets \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" and has a weird three way love child with \\"Fuel\\") the other tracks are good mixes of mid-90's Metallica, the best of St. Anger (\\"Shoot Me Again\\", \\"My World\\"), and the feel of Death Magnetic.  Good stuff to be sure.  It won't disappoint anybody who has stayed with the band from the beginning until now and just enjoy them for all they are and not what we wish they were.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All I have to say is that after reading this book, I am emotionally broken in the best way possible. I read this book cover to cover, only pausing when I couldn't see through my tears. This is a must read and definitely not just for \\"young adults\\". This is a beautifully tragic piece of literature that I plan to reread just as soon as I can compose myself.
031620157X|3.0|I would happily recommend this book to an 8- to 14-year-old. It's a fun story, a neat take on the classic fairy-tales. So why only 3 stars? It's just not terribly well written. Every single thing is spelled out, leaving nothing to the imagination. For example: \\"Alex suddenly became very tense. It had just occurred to her that, along with all the characters she had grown up loving, all the ones she hated and feared actually existed, too. It made her feel very uneasy and very unsafe.\\"<br /><br />The 3rd-person narration is mostly from Alex and Connor's point of view, but every once in a while there's a paragraph of another character's internal thoughts and feelings -- not often enough to be an omniscient narrator, so it just feels random. Alex and Connor sometimes behave like naive young children and sometimes like children wise beyond their years, but not in a complex character way, just in a random way. And there are little things, like using the same word twice in one short paragraph. All in all, I think the whole thing needed a much harsher editor.<br /><br />It's a pretty fast read, but it is long, so perhaps 10-14 would be a better age range, plus younger but more advanced readers. If I remember correctly, the protagonists are supposed to be in the fifth grade, which would normally skew it a bit younger, but their maturity level is so inconsistent that I think it could appeal to a pretty wide age range on an emotional level. It's long and has a decently varied vocabulary, but writing is not at all dense or complicated. Definitely tough to pin down the appropriate age range!<br /><br />I truly don't think all the things that bothered me would prevent most kids from enjoying the story, so again, I would happily recommend it to any child who seemed interested. But if, like me, you're an adult who loves fractured/retold/reinterpreted fairly tales, you can afford to skip this one. Actually, it's probably a pretty good screenplay, so maybe we can all go see the moviesomeday!<br /><br />(Note: I received a free advance reading copy of this book from the publisher at an American Library Association Annual Conference. I was not required to write a positive review. Thank you, Little, Brown!)

B004FUZLYG|3.0|i have to split the difference with other reviews: this is neither excellent scarlatti nor percussive and assaultive playing. it is rather a charming but conventional selection of scarlatti sonatas played in the postmodern (hyper detailed) version of the romantic manner. the performance is managed in the way of professional declamation and crowd pleasing theatrics; the color and legerdemain are astonishing and sure to bring applause. it's all beautiful playing, incontestably, but everything -- even the fireworks -- is on a leash. i use those metaphors with a particular prejudice: in my conception, scarlatti's music is a performer's trial by zen puzzle. it invariably brings out the illusory and real in a performer's temperament (without ever revealing much about scarlatti himself), and in particular the difference between artifice and artistry, control and risk. this recording lacks the visceral, alchemical and unexpected outcomes that happen when the performer lets himself be surprised at what amazing things the hands are doing or that scarlatti has inspired him to attempt. for tharaud it's control, poise and calculation in every bar, a perfectly prepared repast on silver, porcelain and whitest linen. and while marketing is probably not under tharaud's control, it's offputting to receive a recording in which all four cover surfaces of the case and booklet are vanity portraits of the performer.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|(Note: I will update this when I get the Blu-ray).<br /><br />The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance, as even more memories start to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken). Actually, for a while Universal Studios had been negotiating another Bourne movie with Damon, but he said he'd only take the role if Greengrass was directing. The two of them had signed on for something, at the very least, but things never fell through for another sequel, and the tandem would go on to make Green Zone (a pretty engaging military conspiracy thriller in itself, but that's for another review).<br /><br />Instead of Damon and Greengrass doing another Jason Bourne entry, we have something of a spinoff. The Bourne Legacy was written by Eric Van Lustbader and merely inspired by Robert Ludlum's work, so I guess you can't say there's really a \\"direct\\" correlation in terms of source material deviation. On the other hand, this new entry was written and directed by Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplays for the first 3 films, wrote/directed Michael Clayton, and wrote the story for State of Play (both being excellent thrillers in their own right). He also wrote/directed Duplicity, which I guess could technically fall under the thriller genre, but the romantic comedy elements made it feel like something else entirely. So how did Gilroy's third directing project go?<br /><br />The story begins in the snowy mountains of Alaska where Outcome agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is undergoing survival training. Meanwhile, news of Blackbriar's demise and the controversy surrounding it have forced Outcome's director Eric Byer (Edward Norton) into action after evidence had surfaced linking the founders of both Treadstone/Blackbriar and Outcome together. In an effort to stop this trail from leading back to them, Byer decides to shut the program down and burn it to the ground, eliminating any and all personnel involved. When a scientist for the program, Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), witnesses the murder of her colleagues, she and Cross become the remaining loose ends and must survive on the run to discover the answers behind the conspiracy.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the movie is its maintaining of realism. Just like how cool it was for Bourne to escape every situation by a hair's breadth or for him to set up the ultimate of break-ins and steal something vital, I'd say this was about as realistic as what was shown in Greengrass' films. Not \\"realistic\\" in the sense of believability, per se, but in the sense of how things could work out. The element of improvisation is still there in Cross, and while his end results may not be as flashy as when Bourne is outsmarting or outwitting an entire task force, many of Cross' scenes are still entertaining to watch. And a lot of it has to do with Renner's performance. The character he portrays isn't nearly as mysterious as Damon's originally was, but it's a very likeable one. This is only the 4th movie I've ever seen him in (the others being The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and The Avengers), but it's really the only other starring role I've seen him do, and I think he does a great job. He has a good amount of charisma and enough ferocity in his action sequences to be revered and feared, and depending on where they go after this, I hope he really gets a chance to shine like Damon did as Bourne.<br /><br />I also love that they got Edward Norton to play the antagonist. He's a brilliant actor to begin with, and to see him as something of a villain was a real treat. He's always had a natural ability to take command on screen, and his role as Byer is no exception. Pretty much any time he's talking, it's hard not to pay attention to him, even if the other characters on screen with him are of a higher rank. His performance feels very intelligent and shadowy enough, but I was hoping the story would've allowed for him to show a meaner side every now and then. It's a very convincing role, and again, if they end up making a sequel I would love for him to return and hope that they write even more opportunities for him to become a well-developed character.<br /><br />And finally, I thought the scientific approach to the black ops program was a nice touch. Jason Bourne was more about the personal side of a cold-blooded assassin re-discovering his humanity and atoning for all the people he killed, which, symbolically, makes for great cinema. But the explanation on how he became so skilled in everything was just a given. We're to assume he's just good at what he does, and that's that. Here, the capabilities of an agent are, perhaps, less cool to think about in terms of \\"yeah, he kicks ass,\\" just because he can. Aaron Cross seems more like he has the knowledge of things, but the lack of extreme force makes the overall tone of everything he does seem more down-to-earth. Although, I guess a lot of it has to do with the cinematography and editing as well (most of the trademark Greengrass shaky-cam is gone this time around). All in all, it feels nice to know where some of these talents and skills are coming from.<br /><br />Now on to the actual movie. It's slow, but fast. I know that's a weird way to describe it, but it really is. When I say \\"slow,\\" I mean the pacing is at about the same speed as The Bourne Identity. Throughout the film, you're given pieces of the plot, the occasional flashback to fill in some of the gaps or to develop Cross, and it all slowly builds towards a climax. And when I say \\"fast,\\" I mean that I was so engrossed in trying to fit the pieces together, by the time I knew it, the movie was over. It's odd that for barely over 2 hours I was really wanting to know more about Cross' and Byer's pasts, what the true scope and reach of the genetic engineering project was, and just how many of these black ops programs really existed. And then there was this big chase sequence at the end, and it was done. I will say that if you go into this expecting a similar style to Identity, you'll be disappointed. The amnesia thing for Bourne was unique and his working backwards to find the truth was even more so. It was a plot of mystery and intrigue that was kind of pre-established already and Bourne just had to pick up the pieces. That's not the case here with Cross.<br /><br />As a character, the flashbacks work as a device to build him, slowly and thoroughly, but he already knows who he is. I firmly believe that if this film is financially successful enough that they'll continue to try and develop his character forwards, instead of backwards. I think that if they're smart enough to write a good story arc for his character, they'll include more and more flashbacks working their way up to a realization of what he can or does become. And to achieve this, I'm a little on the fence about the inclusion of Shearing. As talented as Weisz is, her character felt a tad over-reactive and panicky at times, which added a little too much of a \\"damsel in distress\\" quality to the rest of the film (i.e. makes her look weak). I suppose it makes sense to mimic the male-female coupling for the search of truth so they can rely on one-another. But like Franka Potente said about playing Marie, her character wasn't as cliché and the chemistry between Bourne and her was purposely sporadic. I just hope the relationship between Cross and Shearing doesn't become too melodramatic at some point. Then again, they could always kill her, too.<br /><br />Picture-wise, I saw this on a digital projector at my local Cinemark. The movie itself was shot on 35mm and processed digitally and looks pretty spectacular. As much as I loved the documentary shaky-cam aesthetic Greengrass employed in his films, the one drawback to it was that the picture never really stayed still long enough for you to just look at something in a still frame and enjoy it, aside from the occasional scenic overhead shot of a city that lasted for all but 2 or 3 seconds until it zoomed in and cut to the next shaky shot. Here, Robert Elswit's photography has a much wider lens view, and yes, more static shots. Elswit also worked on Mission Impossible 4, which also starred Renner, ironically, and I think that may have influenced the wider shots after working with the IMAX cameras for that one. In terms of editing, the task is performed by Tony's brother John, and is also a lot less kinetic. Closeup shots are used about as much as they had been in the other Bourne films since the dialogue is so important, but I like that even without the quick cuts during action sequences, it sacrifices intensity for appreciation of the actual choreography. For the stunts, they brought back Dan Bradley who directed all the stunt work in the previous films, and the fights were coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio who was an assistant in the fights of Ultimatum and the lead choreographer for Haywire(really love the fights in that movie).<br /><br />Music-wise, James Newton Howard takes over for John Powell. I will stress that I absolutely loved Powell's work for the first 3 movies and that Bourne's main theme and the pulsating drums of his action pieces are one of the best sounds I've heard for any action movie outside of Hans Zimmer. Howard doesn't quite capture the same essence, but again, this is a completely different cast of characters. Thematically, he does manage to sneak in a little bit of Bourne's theme into some of his pieces, but only faintly and probably as a reminder that this movie is part of the franchise. The overall sound, however, is a lot more contemporary and even has some electric guitar in it. The more upbeat percussionist pieces used for the action sequences also carry a similar beat akin to Powell's, though are a little more variant with other instruments around it. In listening to the soundtrack, there doesn't seem to be a central theme or motif within any one piece to represent Cross' character, which is a little disappointing. As a whole, though, the score makes for great ambiance. And hopefully, if any sequels are made and become more action-packed, Howard will reach into his bag for some more up-tempo tricks.<br /><br />Overall, my expectations weren't set too high, but I was pleasantly surprised at this new character. The story has less mystery and intrigue, but instead a more linear approach to it, with Jason Bourne only being a reference point. The \\"Legacy\\" is more so about the super-soldier learning to think for himself and bailing a corrupted system as per Bourne's example. Even Greengrass stated in his commentaries that the villains weren't really bad guys, they were just part of a bad system. And with the potential to take the franchise in, hopefully, a newer, even fresher direction with Aaron Cross, something will come of it, be it Gilroy returning to write, direct, or whatever. Nowhere left to go now, but forward.<br /><br />Overall: 3.5 / 5.0
0439023513|2.0|Seriously? I invest the time to read all three books and THIS is the ending she gives us?<br /><br />I was riveted by the entire Hunger Games series. I couldn't put any of the books down. I stayed up way too late to finish them. I cared about the characters, I was sucked in by the action, and I desperately wanted to know what happened. When I finished Catching Fire, I fully expected this to be a series that I would go back and read over and over again.<br /><br />And then there was Mockingjay. The action was still riveting, and I still wanted to know how it turned out. I wanted to understand what was really going on with Coin. I wanted Katniss to be triumphant because she had been strong and resourceful. Alas. The Katniss I loved in Hunger Games was mostly gone, I'm still not sure I understand Coin's ultimate goals, and I have rarely felt so dissatisfied with how things turned out. When I closed Mockingjay after reading the last page, I just felt irritated. I think I'm irritated that I was so invested in the story and the characters before being so completely let down, but honestly, I still haven't figured out what I think or feel about it.

0062073486|5.0|Not many authors can say they CREATED an entire genre, but Christie can.  Here, she creates, for the first time, the idea of a group of people trapped together in an imposing, dangerous house where they all start to die, one by one, buidling suspense for the reader to see in anyone will make it out alive.  The plot structure/scenario was so ingenious and done so well by Christie that it's been copied many, many times over in films, TV and even games (Clue, anyone?).  Still, Christie's original started it all and is the best.<br /><br />Written in short chapters that are further broken up into subsections, it's a fast read that keeps the action moving.  Christie is a master at giving you just the right amount of information you need and not getting all caught up in the characters' subtext.  She lets you make up your own mind about who's good/bad and keeps the story moving.  She does this quite well as she introduces the characters, giving the reader just bits of their \\"sins of the past\\" and brings each of their crimes further into view through memories, flashbacks and dreams as the story moves forward.  Everyone has something to hide, crimes that slipped through the loop holes of the law...but now someone has brought them all here to face their reckoning in a house on a deserted island.<br /><br />The genius of this book lies in how Christie manages to create ten characters with full backstories, weave them together and keeps them all straight at the same time...all in LESS than 200 pages!  She's an expert at writing with economy that could teach a thing or two to most contemporary writers who blather on in long tangents with non-story related material that their editors are afraid to cut out of their 300+ page doorstops.  In a Christie novel, not a single word is wasted.<br /><br />The plot of the book is so expertly put together that everything works off of the previous and leads to the next plot element like the workings of a clock.  The suspense is built in.  You can feel it each time you're SURE of who the murderer is...and then that person is killed.  What then?  The reader is constantly having to retrace their steps, start over and look at things from a different perspective...considering things they might not have before.  As the clock ticks down along with the number of suspects...the suspense get amped up each time.<br /><br />This is one of Christie's best.  Clearly imitation is the best for of flattery and there's clearly been plenty of that concerning And Then There Were None over the last nearly 100 years.  That's why Christie will always be the gold standard in murder mystery/suspense.  I'd also recommend Toward Zero, Crooked House and Sleeping Murder, three of her very best along with this one.can feel it each time you're SURE of who the murderer is...and then that person is killed.

Does his board members get mad because he never shows up for work? I am sure investors in his company might want to know where the President of the company is all the time.  Also, who talks like these two? Write what you know! Clearly the author is British yet the Pacific Northwest is the setting. Christian talks like a east coast boarding school Harvard educated man from the 1920's Or, an Oxford grad from an well to do family from England.  Sooo annoying.  I admit I drank the cool aid and bought the books due to the hype. The first book was tolerable. The second was excruciating.  Want sexy books, read the first five or six of J.R.

I've seen pornography before, but unless you are addicted to it, it didn't phase me at all. It was like a DVD version of Penthouse Magazine. It was slow, it was \\"messed up,\\" like Guggione is/was, but it's the S L O W E S T movie I've ever seen, and it doesn't even bother me that I don't like it. Just wanted a copy for my library.

B005QUQP76|5.0|Hi wanted to help confirm to people who are thinking about this mouse or the m60. I was scared with the mixed reviews. I had a Naga which i never felt comfortable with, I did not like the feel or button setup. I sold Naga and got both m90 and m60 with the money. Let me tell you these are some of the best mice i have ever used. Top quality feel Top quality performnance. I updated the firmware right out of box \\"may be why I have had no problems\\" but they are amazing quality. The tracking on naga sucked i would watch it move with no one touching the mouse \\"after reading many reviews of new lazer mice i kinda thought this was expected \\"but the m90 and m60 are perfect no lift problems or tracking problems at all\\". The m90 buttons are a little strange but, i have never hit the wrong one. I think they should texture every other button just to help distict them apart, but so far so good. and the m60 side button the back one is curved in just a bit, i wish it wasn't. i have not used the m60 as much and will probaly get used to that anyway. overall those are small problems as far as quality and response they are spot on top quality. this mouse should be $100.00 easy, \\"use a naga and see if you dont agree with me\\" naga was light weight bad tracking 12 button on side with 80% peeps only reaching 6 of them.<br /><br />The naga programing was a little easyer to start with, but after 10 min use with cosair software it realy is better \\"again i got new firmware and software as soon as i hooked them up\\" but if you know anything about macro making and delay time and that sort of stuff you will own in gaming with this mouse. in WoW frost dk 386 ilvl gear i can do 34k with 1 button lol, enhancement sham 384 gear i do 36k 1 button. dont get me wrong you gota know the game and how to make macro but this mouse has the power....\\"which the naga could do that also any macroing mouse could\\"<br /><br />as far as some saying it dont work in swtor they are wrong, INFACT this is where it will beatother mice. let me explain. some games try to stop macroing it allows the ones with the knowledge to run all over the peeps who dont know how, so to beat this record the profile to the mouse then select hardware mode \\"that way its not running in the software emulation of the mouse\\". and BOOM, i have 14 level murader and and get 30- 50 kills pvp so there you go. plus i never seen software out run hardware direct input, i think the mouse works even better in hardware mode.<br /><br />Gamers dont hate me for macroing, in my day i was hardcore killing machine... it has lead me to have trigger finger, carpal tunnel, and arthritis. so i paid my dues, and to make the macro takes having the knowledge of the game engine, so it proves im a real gamer. lol<br /><br />I for one think at this price you would be a fool not to buy this mouse. if i had the extra money i would buy some for back up use. These are top quality feel, tracking, and programing, if some one broke in my house i could give them a good beating with this thing, and it would probaly still work. lol<br /><br />and before someone says im just a fanboy or something....no to be truthful i dont use corsair ram i use patriat ram lol.. and as far as naga fans dont get mad just telling my side... the naga is still a good mouse just not the right one for me.<br />  thank you for reading  just getting the word out there.<br /><br />background I am a hardcore gamer for 15 years. have spent around 45k to 50k in gaming gear in 15 years so i do have alittle exp with it.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I saw that this book had a good review by Michael J. Sullivan (loved Riyria Revelations), so I got it for Kindle on my phone. Well within seconds I hated the italics in the first chapter (not sure why, just grind-ed my gears). Well I skipped to the next chapter and there were no italics. By this point I'm annoyed so I say to myself \\"won't be be more than a few pages before I scrap this book\\". But the story just kind of grabbed me. Next thing I know, it's 2 in the morning and I have to be up by 5 for work. This is a long book and I went through it in about 4 days. If you can get over a few minor grammatical errors and you're a fan of fantasy, you'll enjoy this book.

0061692042|5.0|Narrated in three parts,Dell Parsons recalls the time when he and his twin sisters lives changed course through circumstances outside their control and perceptions of the world around them when their parents carry out an ill conceived bank robbery.15 years of assumed certainty and goals end as their parents are jailed. Dell's mother makes arrangements with her only friend Mildred to take the twins to Canada to be with Mildreds brother Arthur. Berner flees before Mildred comes, leaving Dell to make the journey alone and discover that Arthur Remlinger is escaping a past of his own...<br /> A great narrative in the tradition and style of all great American novels, and where Ford-to my thinking-finally perfects his \\"Hemingway\\" style;short sentences packed with detail and imagry of the Saskatchewan landscape,whilst still very much being Richard Ford.<br /> Ford explores the lack of permanence in peoples lives; how lives can change completely in a split second; the need to make sense of things in the world-even the most senseless- in order to put meaning and context in our lives. \\"We're born with an empty life and have to fill it\\" Our past and histories are our baggage in life and if we cant leave it and move on to the next phase of our lives, then the past can become a black hole forever dragging you in.<br /> Another great novel from a great writer (America's greatest living author?). Arguably the best book of 2012.
0345803485|3.0|I honestly don't understand how this book is a bestseller considering that the writing is so poorly done. It feels like a teenager wrote this. There are way too many repetitions and you can even look at other reviews that explain this exasperating fact in more detail so you can believe how annoying is this. I do like the story, the main characters and the whole concept or idea of the book and would like to know how everything ends. BUT the problem is that the writing is REALLY awful to the point I feel embarrassed that some good writers out there don't have the same success in book sales compared with this poorly written book. I bought the 2nd book to see if the story and writing gets better but it gets even worse, to the point that the inane rambling of the main character made me roll my eyes every other sentence. I'm not sure I will buy the 3rd book. Will consider if I manage to finish the 2nd one and feel motivated to know how the story ends.

0385737955|4.0|This was indeed an above average novel worth the attention of any sci-fi reader. I hate how limited the star scale of rating is, I'd say this is more along a 70-75/100 if we use a standard scale of rating.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />-Can't say it enough, the plot was quite impressive. The world we see appears small, but it elegantly blossoms into a much longer and more thought out universe without seeming like it sprung from magician's hat. Yes, the author instills a sense of \\"something else is out there\\" from the get go, but I was surprised to see how far the rabbit hole goes. I also enjoyed how the author didn't take me to the end of the hole just yet.<br />-The pace was manicured. At first, the slow-ish beginning seemed off-putting, but The Maze Runner builds upon itself; a chain reaction of events that raises the stakes bit by bit, until it became addicting.<br />-The allusions and riddles...I won't elaborate, but it made me slap my head and think \\"how could I have missed that!\\" These little surprises were hidden well but not excessively, and I only guessed one of the twists.<br />-The epilogue...again spoilers but prevent me from detailing as to why, but this book had the best epilogue I have ever read. At first, I was upset because I have a thing against X-logues, but this one was jaw-dropping.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />-I found the writing to be quite vanilla. No wham lines, no deep internalizations, just typical thoughts. The protagonist also has a tendency to be trite, which is even lampshaded by one of the \\"gladers.\\" Also, Dashner would benefit from more rigorous revisions, because he had several unnecessary prepositions, fluff and stock phrases, occasionally telling, which just made me roll my eyes. Thankfully, the concept was solid enough for me to overlook it.<br />-Creative biology-a sixteen year old with a fully established beard and chest hair? Impossible unless Sir Frypan has a certain genetic anomaly.<br />-The \\"profanity\\" was very irritating.Very irritating.  Like \\"poo makes a klunk noise when it falls in our pee pots,\\" and seeing the word \\"shank/shuck/shuckiest/shuck-face\\" among other variants was laughably sophomoric. I know, we all want to be creative, but he wasted his energy on these words. It subtracted 2-5 years of maturity from all of his characters. Check this out. 'What the shuckin' shuck? That slinthead Dashner wouldn't stop writ in' klunk about them shanks and they shucked around like the slintiest shanks in shush-faced world.' Yes, I made that up, but do you get my point, shuck-face? I mean, seriously, when I was sixteen, my swearing was ten times more mainstream, and ten times less awkward.<br />-There was one gratuitous death scene at the end, I won't say who, but you'll know when you read it. I can tell the author killed him off just to strike a chord. He empathized well, but I wished he made it significant to the plot, instead of it being just another sad event occurring.<br /><br />I know I listed a lot in the bad category, but all of that only totals to a -1 star in my mind because the cleverness of the plot can carry so much weight. If you like sci fi and follow the current trend of dystopian fiction, give this a try, and you'll love it. If not, try something else, because it carries little outside its genre.

B004CJB0CM|4.0|I enjoyed Jillian's video.  She works you very hard in a short amount of time, but it is much easier to find 20 minutes out of your day to work out than it is an hour.
B000005S5N|3.0|In 1984, with one of the most recognizable pop songs of the decade, it would seem that A-ha should have had the world in their hands, especially due to the band that they would grow into; however, despite an astonishing first half and a devastating closer, the work on their sophomore album SCOUNDREL DAYS is something of a conundrum. The good songs are GREAT and the not-so-good songs are pretty bad.<br /><br />Opening with its anthemic title track, SCOUNDREL DAYS is off to a great start with a very synth-heavy and suspenseful opening as it grows into an impossibly well-sustained chorus that still sends chills because of Morten Harket's invincible vocal ability. Following that is arguably the best song of the album \\"The Swing of Things\\", which like some other songs on this album is about longing love and aching heart. \\"I've Been Losing You\\" is a percussive blast to the gut. \\"October\\" is somewhat bland and forgettable, but it picks right back up with \\"Manhattan Skyline\\", as an almost music-box tender beauty is ripped apart with a violent clashing of strained voice, dissonant electronic sound and punishing percussion.<br /><br />Then the album falls to pieces. Songs like \\"Cry Wolf\\", \\"We're Looking for the Whales\\", \\"The Weight of the Wind\\", and \\"Maybe, Maybe\\" all have the same thing in common: they're all incredibly annoying from a musical and lyrical standpoint, with \\"Cry Wolf\\" being the least offensive, but still a bad song. The album then steps up in defiance of the previous songs to give its most powerful, most lyricially dreamy, and most moving musical crescendo with \\"The Soft Rains of April\\", a song that, if the rest of the album were so daring, would have been far superior.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; SCOUNDREL DAYS is absolutely worth owning for the great songs that ARE on this album, but I fear that A-ha was a little too off-kilter with the weaker tracks to find it in my heart to give this any glowing recommendation.<br /><br />3/5 Stars.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Sometimes it's handy to have a spare clock for travel or home, and [[ASIN:B008RA3X5E Alarm Clock]] for the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD or Android device is one of those apps that adds to the versatility of this device. What makes this one so good is that it's simple to set up, yet it offers a number of customizable options that make it truly yours.<br /><br />It downloads it cleanly in seconds, then you go to the setup page, which can be accessed at all times by touching the upper right corner of the screen with your finger or stylus. You'll see a little gear symbol, and wide variety of options for personalization show up as check boxes. Starting with the Display category, you can show seconds, show day, and show next alarm. In the clock style selection, you can choose between Digital (the default), Thinline (a contemporary analog clock), or Wordy (a fascinating selection that will tell you the time with highlighted words on a wood-grained background).<br /><br />There's a Weather section just below, and you can set your location, your temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius, wind speed in a variety of options, and then choose whether or not display those details on the clock face. There are a number of other options in the Advanced section, where you can set the alarm volume, the snooze duration and much more. Add to this, the developer has added a detailed Help & Feedback section, something that I would like to see from more apps here.<br /><br />This clock works in either portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal) modes... just move your device and it changes to follow how you want to see the display. It also has a nightstand mode, where you can turn your Android device into a desktop or bedside clock while it's charging to prevent battery drain. It should be noted that this same developer offers a freebie version, [[ASIN:B009ZZDNT6 Alarm Clock Free]], which is the first one that I got here. It's worth trying if you're unsure, but subjectively I found the multitude of advertisements to be distracting in this version.<br /><br />It's frustrating to buy or get a freebie on an app here, only to find that it hangs up, has problems or is poorly documented. This one is the type that sets a standard for the right way to make an app that takes full advantage of what the device offers. I've also used [[ASIN:B008P1EWIM Weather Live]] in the Kindle Fire edition from the same developer, and this one uses a familiar AccuWeather-style interface, which is customizable to your location and offers a number of different ways to display the weather and more.<br /><br />Update: Have also installed this app on my Samsung Galaxy S III phone shortly after I got it in early 2013, as it had proven to be so good with my Kindle Fire tablets. Buy it once if you have multiple devices, and it becomes a real bargain.<br /><br />There are plenty of other time display and alarm clock apps for the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD or Android devices here on Amazon, and you should check the reviews first before you grab any of them. [[ASIN:B008RA3X5E Alarm Clock]] stands alone in terms of having such a good looking and highly functional interface, and it works quite well. Highly recommended to all who are looking for a good time keeping app, and it looks good as well.<br /><br />8/11/2012; updated 1/23/2012de of advertisements to be distracting in this version.<br /><br />It's frustrating to buy or get a freebie on an app here, only to find that it hangs up, has problems or is poorly documented.

B005BCE7II|1.0|Worst 3D movie ever.I bought this movie because of 3d.I was very disappointed.<br />Not worth too watch as 3d movie.
030758836X|5.0|I bought this book because I saw it on a list of novels with plot twists - I was searching for something like the Sixth Sense or Shutter Island which had a final, game-changing twist that made you want to re-read everything that had happened before.<br /><br />For anyone else brought to it like I was, Gone Girl does NOT have such a final plot twist. The last few pages do make you re-evaluate everything that has gone before, but only in that you thought it was a psychological thriller, and realise in the end that it's a satire. And it works, and is a good coda, but there's no mind-bending twist.<br /><br />That SAID... Gone Girl has twists (and twisted twists at that) in virtually every chapter, which more than makes up for the denouement. Flynn is a masterful plotter of her yarn - and it kept me utterly captivated - I can't remember the last time I was so eager to keep reading a book to find out what happens next - or what had happened before...

The side theme of Simon and Charlie, with Simon and Alice being attracted to each other, didn't quite work. Plus, the final chapter was redundant and repetitive, except for the confrontation with David. All in all, I was sucked in completely.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|This is probably not a terribly reliable review--I don't watch many movies, and so I don't have much with which to compare one to another, but as enjoyable experiences go, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows rates quite high. I don't go looking for movies, and I only caught the first of the series by chance on TV, but it was enough to guarantee I'd seek out the sequel.  Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are brilliantly in and out of each others' heads as Holmes and Watson, and the verbal dexterity and subtly different shades of wit between them drew me in and gave the movie a wickedly pleasurable texture. There was such an effortless liveliness, grace and fondness between the two actors--a pleasure to watch, all around. We almost lost the actor Robert Downey Jr.so very many times, and of course, the loss would have been tragic, but I'm grateful he managed to hang around to do his most recent work--based on my admittedly limited perspective, he just keeps getting better. Really lovely.
1401223176|4.0|Most people complained about this book as a Jim Lee story written by Loeb, and I partially agree. There is a lot of eye candy in this book courtesy of Mr. Jim Lee, who is a phenomenal comic book artist. But, in some instances he may be too good. I felt that some characters from both Batman's rogues galary and his comrades were forced into the story. Why did Huntress show up? It felt very unnecessary to me, but on to the greatness.<br /><br />This story was a good detective story with a lot of twists, but because of my prior knowledge of Batman, I knew who the killer was right away, but it did not take away from the story. It starts with Batman running off to save some kid (first 2 pages, don't worry), but all of a sudden, the Bat is flung into this insanely twisted mystery that, until the very last pages, he had know idea who was behind it all. As I said earlier, MANY of Batman's villains are in this and they all played a fairly significant role in the grand scheme of things...And it was a GRAND scheme. I give kudos to Loeb for consistently being able to layer a story with so many twists and turns to keep me reading. If you do not like Loeb, stay away from this. If you like reading a good Batman story with incredible art, BUY THIS PLEASE. This was my first exposure to the comic book Batman (previously played both Arkham games), and I loved every page (minus Huntress :p) of this book.
0061547840|5.0|I am only 1/3 the way through the book, but I am really enjoying reading it. Donald Trump give great advice...adivice of the type I need to learn!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I enjoyed Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children a lot, more than a bunch of other movies out there. There may be a little bias involved since Final Fantasy VII (the game this movie is a sequel to, for anyone who isn't aware) is one of my favorite games. The CG is beautiful, some of the best I've seen out of all the CG movies out there. The action is great, it might seem a little ridiculous to some, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and really given the nature of the movie I wouldn't call it ridiculous by any means. The characters were of course good, however I was a little disappointed that they didn't give some of them larger roles, it seemed like it was basically just Cloud and Tifa on the screen, with a little bit of Vincent and the Shinra cast thrown in here and there. I'd of liked to see more of Barret, Red XIII, Yuffie, etc. The story, while I enjoyed it and thought fit in very well with the FFVII universe, could possibly be hard to understand and follow if you have not played the game. Overall, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is a good movie, and even better if you've played and liked the game. I would recommend it.
0307719774|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! She is a high school sophomore and she says she will write in it everyday! It's also about the size of your hand, so she can keep it in her locker or backpack when she goes back to school. The appearance of it is also very beautiful. It's great for high school or college, so you can see how much you have changed over the course of 5 years! 5/5 stars!
1401232590|4.0|This book was, hands down, one of the best batman books I have read. The art was completely different from anything I have looked at in my young comic reading career (if you want to call it that). I have only been reading comics for about 6 months and Batman was the first super hero who I really related to and enjoyed. Things like Year One, Hush and The Dark Knight Returns were my first exposure to him, and those were all excellent. After reading Hush, I wanted to venture more into Loeb's writings, and I read some reviews on this so I decided to pick it up.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that at the very beginning it was a little hard to follow (for me) who was speaking to who, because they really didn't let you see who it was. To my relief, it was resolved a couple pages later and I was right back on track.<br /><br />Now for the positives. Firstly, let me say that the book was so enticing and \\"delicious\\" that I read it cover to cover in one sitting. The book is split into 13 parts, each coorelating to a certain holiday. I won't spoil anything else for those who have yet to read it, but the mystery that drives this book was excellent in my opinion. Until the killer was revealed I thought I knew who it was...I was terribly terribly wrong, but that is not a bad thing.<br />If you are looking for a story on Bruce Wayne, this is not it, this is a Batman/Harvey Dent/Gordon story with a little pinch of Catwoman. All in all, this book was borderline perfect for me, and I HIGHLY recommend it to both new and seasoned Batman readers.<br />4 1/2 stars
B008FHO0MY|5.0|Its not many times I can say I enjoyed most of the songs on any one album so its a pleasant surprise when this happens.  I enjoyed most ot the songs on this album.  Right now my favorite is ' Don't Judge me' I listened to that over and over again because you can definitely make it personal.  Also \\"baseline\\" makes me want to dance like Chris Brown even though I don't have the ability at all too.  \\"Don't wake me up\\" is great too because it makes me feel like I'm in the club but I'm at home which is pretty cool.  I definitely love this album and its diversity and variety.  Its a must have in anyone's collection.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Bought this off of Amazon for $112 and received it 8-3-2012<br /><br />In the little time I have owned this, I have used this quite bit, more so of getting used to it and just plain old playing around with it like a little kid. This is VERY bright! I am very impressed by the 800 lumen output. The 4 brightness levels is very ideal for whether shining up close, or shining afar, not to mention help the batteries last longer.<br /><br />Me and the 10 year old boy like to explore at night, more so watch and look for wildlife, such as deer, raccoon, fox, skunk, etc. He enjoys it a lot, so much in fact, that is when I decided to buy a more powerful light. After a bit of research, the Fenix TK-41 really, really stuck out to me. It is a good size, similar to 3D Maglite, it is definitely bright at 800 Lumens. What I really like about it, is it takes 8 AA batteries, and not the special CR 123 batteries either, just regular batteries at any store (although I would highly recommend NiMH batteries). The price is reasonable, and the ratings are very good as you can tell if you are reading this review.<br /><br />I use Sony Cycle Energy rechargeable batteries (NiMH). The TK-41 so far has impressed everyone I've showed it to including myself, it is bright. It is probably equivalent to a Cop's searchlight mounted on the side of the car, because that is what it looked like when we we're shining deer from the road.<br /><br />A great flashlight to have in case of a power outage or emergency. The 4 modes will make the batteries last longer on the lower settings.<br /><br />5 Stars, Works as advertised, and the brightness will not disappoint. Seems well constructed.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|I really did enjoy this book. At the end of each chapter is a recipe for one of the author's favorite vegan recipes. I've tried some of them and they're quite good. I'm a new distance runner and find the whole concept of \\"vegan\\" interesting, but not for me at this point. Also at the end of most chapters is a few paragraphs of practical information about distance running. Truthfully I had hoped for more of this practical information from the author, but again, the book was interesting and I did enjoy it. If you're looking for a \\"how to run an ultra\\" book, this isn't it. The author's story was interesting and I wish him well in handling everything going on in his life now. His story was/is inspiring and, if nothing else, serves as a wake up call to all those who feel like they cannot get up off the couch and move because... \\"sometimes you just do things\\" (a kind of sad saying with a lot of baggage coming with it).
B004LUS390|5.0|I've been using this app for several months on my Coby 10\\" Android tablet. As many have pointed out already, it's the best $2 an artist (or aspiring artist) can spend. It doesn't have all the features of it's desktop counterpart, but what do you expect for 2 bucks. Only 6 layers and the Max image size is 1028×768. It also has a symmetry tool, heh. Good enough if your looking to just sketch on the go. If you're going to do some giant project, you're better off using a desktop program, distraction-free at home. But if you really wanted to, you could do some serious stuff with this app. Just wish there was a \\"save as\\" option.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|The actors are a great lineup and successfully portray this really creepy unsolved missing person story.  I had never heard of the movie but really liked it.  Much more a mystery/psychological suspense than a love story.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Very original and highly entertaining. For those who would complain about the WiFi requirement for download, you cab go into settings and set the limit up to 50mb, which is a wall you will rarely hit.
0880796863|4.0|Nice ornate drawings and rich colors (I especially love the yellows and reds... my brother said they looked \\"evil\\").<br /><br />Cards seem decent quality, and little booklet included with background and history along with reading spreads and brief divination meanings for all the cards.<br /><br />Seems like all you need for a good tarot starter.<br /><br />Price is worth the cards alone; the book leaves things to be desired if you want more in depth info.
034580404X|5.0|First thing alot of people need to remember is how you felt when we were all young and dumb . This is her first time for everything and basically same goes for him. Good story of people dealing with stuff that does happen wether we want to hear it or not and how they deal yes some is stuff i would never do but reading them deal with the emotions of first lust then love is good takes me back to that feeling when i met  my first love and all the feelings. try not to over annalize and go crazy .Banning a book because what people do and dont like is silly. if u dont like then dont read.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This was really really great!  I loved it, my girlfriend loved it, my kids loved it too.  Actually this was the only movie that we watched twice in a row in the theater - we liked it so much, we went back in and watched it a second time.<br /><br />It's one of those rare happy, up-tone movies!  True artwork.  You won't be bored - it captures the attention til the very end.  And great soundtrack!!!!  We downloaded the soundtrack and play it in the car all the time.<br /><br />Watch it, you won't be disappointed!!  :)

B00003CXE7|4.0|Someone I trust recommended this film to me, and someone I distrust said it was bad, so I decided to check it out, and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Admittedly, the thought of ancient Rome brings back images of ferocious lions and burning corpses to a Christian like myself, but I enjoy a good historical fiction as much as the next guy, and this film is certainly that.<br /><br />A trustworthy, courageous roman general named Maximus is rewarded by Caesar for his latest successful campaign, with the promise that when he dies, Maximus must take his place, returning Rome back from the brink of corruption and totalitarian rule.  However, neither Maximus nor Commodus; the son of Caesar, are pleased to hear this.  Commodus assassinates Caesar before he can make his plans known, rising to become the emperor and betraying Maximus, killing his family and trying to have him executed.<br /><br />Maximus is soon captured by slave traders, who sell him as a gladiator.  His military experience and great strength and skill make him a natural in his new profession, but his heart still longs for one thing; the death of Commodus, and the fulfillment of Caesar's last wishes.  The rest of the movie is about the chances that Maximus gets to confront Commodus again, and his quest for revenge and the restoration of the glory of Rome.<br /><br />Though the story itself never really happened, it rang with something rarely seen in movies these days; the message that virtue matters much more than cunning or authority.  At every turn, Maximus is shown to be brave, determined, protective of his friends and faithful to the Caesar who once commanded him in battle, while his enemy Commodus is shown to have every form of vice; greed, selfishness, laziness, cowardice and sloth.<br /><br />The one black spot on this movie's record in this regard is that ultimately, it is still a story about revenge.  Oh, sure, they include a lot of stuff about \\"fighting for the glory of Rome,\\" and struggling for the good of the people, but in the end, you know the real reason why Maximus is fighting so hard is that he wants to avenge the deaths of his family.<br /><br />I say this is the only black spot because any traditional kind of story, like this one, is going to have conflict and bloodshed.  It's inevitable.  There's a reason why this film is rated R.  However, even this is not taken to the extreme it could have been.  Most of the time, Maximus is essentially forced to fight and kill, and in one noteworthy instance, he actually shows mercy in a fight against a strong opponent; a rare thing in the roman games.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, what I liked most about this film was the noble sacrifices made by the hero and his friends in the later parts of the film, and the movie's very clear message that there is an afterlife, and what you do in this life matters for that very reason.  It's a truth too often ignored; too infrequently discussed.  By no means would I consider this film perfect, but I definitely enjoyed it.  Just don't try showing it to the kids.
B008KEQM3W|5.0|This movie is the perfect example of what it is like to be pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or decide on adoption. Everyone is dealing with it in their own ways.  You will laugh, cry, and cheer during this movie.  And Wendy and Gary are so funny!  You won't be disappointed.  And no, it's not about the book.  How boring would that be??

B001NOQI3U|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie.  Barbara Striesand is superb in the leading role. Her voice is top-notoched. The songs in the moive balance the movie and fit so well. The story of fundamental rights we take for granted.  A time when women were't allowed to seek knowledge. A desire to learn and grow and trying to balance the love of learning and having to choose between love of a man and family or books and knowlege.  Can't have both.  Wow! I can't imagine having to choose.  Papa can you hear me? Papa watch me fly.  Wooo just makes me wanna cry even thinking of it now.  This is Barbara at her finest.

B006BZ8WAI|5.0|I've been a Korn fan since probably '96.  My second concert was Korn's Life Is Peachy tour when Limp Bizkit opened for them back when Limp Bizkit was still handing out free tapes at the show to get people to listen.  I still remember that show as one of my favorites and I've seen many since then.  Anyways, I actually really love The Path of Totality.  I like the new style, the dubstep, mixed in with my favorite Korn sounds.  There's still the bagpipes, the crazy roaring Jonathan Davis does, the heaviness, the bouncing bass.  I love Korn and this album is freaking cool, even if it's got \\"newness\\" to it.  A lot of people seem to dislike that, but sometimes change is good.  I think it worked for Korn this time around.  I love this album.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This film is really just a rip off of Pirates of the Caribbean except it is set on mars. Some of the characters are memorable especially my favorite the moon doggie that follows John Carter around in most of the film. For kids this one will be great for their audience. If you watch this film though it is only really visually exceptional in 3-D, so if you can watch it in that format.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I just received this set a few days ago and have started playing it. I started to play the discs in numerical sequence and will continue until all are played.  The first two are mono, but the rest are in stereo.  Some of the recordings I already have on vinyl which I had purchased during their original releases.  Hearing them now on CD's, are a revelation to behold and now, no clicks or pops, fuzz on stylus etc. to blemish the total sound.  The packaging is convenient, but if you must have further info on the music you will have to search out that info yourself as that data is not included with the set. It's really amazing that recordings from the 1950's can surpass current ones.  Now, how about those wonderful classics from the Westminster label being done up the same way?
B0088TG252|4.0|This one is a pretty darn good film but then again Denzel Washington always has good films with the exception of 1 or 2. A definite must see for action/thriller films.

1451608659|5.0|After reading this book that is all I could say, \\"wow\\".  I had read Bela's \\"Feel no Fear\\" and thought - awww the poor Karolyi's, however after reading this book they make me sick, and I wonder how/why are they so respected in the gymnastics world and in such a high place of power?  Through this book I have lost a lot of respect for Elite gymnastics - it's like we have our own little communist gymnastics system, right here in the USA.<br />I commend Dominique for coming out of it all on top, and hope others out there read this book :)  Fantastic read - I read it in one night.  I hope my daughter is a gymnast, but never an elite :)

044655667X|5.0|I'll start by saying this is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, so I don't know how it compares to his other works. But what I do know is that it's been a long, long time since a novel had captivated me so. I was glued to the page and at the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I'm a slow reader compared to some other reviewers on the site. If I'm really into a book, I'd get through maybe 100 pages on a free day. However, I finished The Fifth Witness's 500-plus pages in only three days, having read close to 300 pages on the last day. Connelly keeps the tension up, and the pacing brisk, and the result is a novel that you can't put down.<br /><br />I love legal thrillers, and the sheer amount of detail this book provides about the law and the various ways in which it can be manipulated is mind-blowing. The entire portion of the book dealing with the trial was fascinating to me. It was structured brilliantly and the techniques the main character employed were ingenious, and a joy to read.<br /><br />Mickey Haller, the main character, was extremely likeable, right from the start. He's a no-nonsense, charming, charismatic character, yet unpredictable and with a bit of a short temper, which makes him all the more interesting. The supporting characters are also fully fleshed out, especially the main antagonist - Prosecutor Andrea Freeman. What a great and unique character!<br /><br />I highly recommend this tremendously entertaining novel, and I can't wait to read Connelly's other Lincoln Lawyer books.

B005LAIIQC|2.0|Going to the midnight showing of The Bourne Legacy I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I had with other movies I've had doubts with. Like I had doubts with when I went to see the Bourne Identity, but before I get to my opinion of the film I must first talk about the films that came before. After all Legacy is a continuation and a direct sequel to the Bourne films, so I must first talk about the previous films a little first. Back in 2001 and 2002 leading up to the Bourne Identity I had only remembered seeing Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan and Good Will Hunting nor had I heard of the books Identity was based off of, so I had my doubts about the film. Still I took a chance and was happily surprised. The Bourne Identity was a great film. The action wasn't over the top like much of the action films of the 1980's and 1990's. It had a unique story, which at the time I don't remember it having been done like it had with this film. The characters were interesting, and the music was great. The film led me to Robert Ludlum novels the film was based off of. I read his three Bourne novels and I must admit I enjoyed the Identity and the rest of the films more then I like the novels. Right now I can only think of one other time that has happened, and it was with The Lord of the Ring series. I enjoyed the novels, but they weren't truly great books. The films on the other hand were great especially the first two. When The Bourne Supremacy came out in 2004 I had no doubts about the film or Mat Damon this time. It was a great film, and that was even with them killing of Marie an important character from the books and a character I liked. That's how good Supremacy was for me, and who could forget the car chase seen in Moscow with Karl Urban. It's one of the best car chases scenes of all time along with the likes of Bullitt, The French Connection, Ronin and The Road Warrior. When The Bourne Ultimatum came out in 2007 it had a lot to live up to, and through I thought it would be good I didn't think it could surpass Supremacy, but again I was wrong. Ultimatum was as good if not better than its predecessor. That's a rarity in films and franchises for a third sequel to be as good if not better than the film that came before. Right now I can only think of a few films like The Revenge of the Sith, The Dark Knight Rises and Alien 3. Ultimatum was a great film and had a good ending. I know the studio and director left an opening for another film, but in my opinion they should had let sleeping dogs lie. Robert Ludlum had stopped writing Bourne novels back in 1990. I know Eric Van Lustbader is a capable writer, but Ludlum had finished Bourne's journey and the novels feel forced. Matt Damon was moving on, and so was Paul Greengrass. If Universal really wanted to continue with the franchise it should have gotten down on its hands and knees and begged those two to come back, and pay them whatever they wanted. You can see why I had my doubts about Legacy. Still with that being said I'd still gave it a chance like I had with Matt Damon and Identity back in 2002, which leads us to Bourne Legacy.<br /><br />Where to begin? Where to begin? I could start with the lackluster action, the uninteresting characters. No I'll start with the forced story. When I saw the trailers it looked like they were trying to turn Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) into some kind of super soldier. If I want to see a movie with super heroes in it I'd go to see any of the super hero films that come out every few months now a days. That was what was so good about the Bourne films. Sure Jason Bourne was government trained killer, but he was still human, and could get hurt. It's one of the reason's the films were so good. In Legacy they tried to destroy what was so good about the previous films with the story about genetics and drugs turning people into super soldiers. Then there is Gilory trying to force his failed story into the Bourne universe. It's like achild trying to force a square peg into a round opening it just isn't going to work. That's what it feels like in this film as director and writer Gilory tries to force his story with Bourne's. Sure Gilory was the writer for the previous films, but he had inspiration from Ludlum's books. If he created this screenplay on his own then he needs to stick to adapting screenplays from novels, because he can't do it on his own. Maybe Universal forced him to do it this way after all I know they were desperate to keep this franchise going. If so then I can forgive him for his lackluster to bad screen play. The only thing or person that truly saves the story is Aaron Cross. His story is compelling especially how he came to be part of the program and who he was before it. The character kept me interested in the film.<br /><br />I like Jeremy Renner. I remember him from the average S.W.A.T. remake along with his good performance in 28 Weeks Later, and his great performance in The Hurt Locker. He is a really good actor. He was one of the truly bright spots character wise in The Avengers as Hawkeye. Sure he should have, but didn't have a lot of screen time, but he did a lot with what he had, and in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol again he was one of the truly bright spots. It's the same with Legacy. He brings emotion and depth to the character, but just like in The Avengers and Ghost Protocol I thought he was short changed as Gilory didn't spend enough time with the Renner/Cross as he spend most of the first part of the film trying to force his story into the Bourne Universe. Besides Renner I can't think of anyone who had a good performance, and that's a shame because this film had a pretty good cast of actors. Edward Norton was forgettable in this film. Stacy Keach was underused. Scott Glenn who I like as an actor was pointless in this film as again he was only used to try and force this story into the franchise. The only one who remotely came close to truly standing out wasRachel Weisz (Marta Shearing). Her character was interesting, and I do like the actress and character, but she reminded me a lot of Marie, which is another thing about the story in this film. It's as if Gilory was trying to reboot the franchise and made it similar to The Bourne Identity.<br /><br />The action which was great in the previous films felt underwhelming in The Bourne Legacy. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that were good. One in a lab which was riveting, and one in a house out in the woods, which I thought was well done. Still the rest was just underwhelming, and the climax, well the climax action scene was just a letdown. Gilory could have done so much, but it was basically a rehash of a scene in one of the previous films. I expect better action from the Bourne franchise.<br /><br />I'm not sure what involvement Universal had in the directing and writing of this film, but if they didn't have much it speaks to what kind of director and writer Tony Gilory is, and like I said earlier as a writer Gilory had the benefit of a source material with the previous films. Now Gilory was on his own with the story. Trying to create his own story that fit into the universe of Bourne and it doesn't work. As a writer he's basically adapted screenplays from their source material and I think he should stick to that. As a director again I question why Universal chose him. Sure he has made one good film in Michael Clayton, but he has directed only two films before. He's never directed action scenes before and you can tell from watching the Legacy.<br /><br />Overall watching this The Bourne Legacy is watching the death of a franchise. There are only two ways this franchise is going to continue/survive. One is that it makes a ton of money, which I don't see happening or Universal gets on its hands and knees and begs Matt Damon to come back to try and save this franchise. That being said this isn't a horrible film. It's just a representation of a studio trying tokeep a franchise alive out of greed. I think the Bourne Legacy could have worked if they had hired a better writer and director and didn't try to force the story into the Bourne universe. It's sad because Jeremy Renner is a really good actor and does a good job in this film with what he has. Still I think the studio should have let the franchise die after Matt Damon and Greengrass didn't come back. The Bourne Legacy isn't a terrible film or bad one it's just a below average action film that shouldn't have been made, and I can't recommend anyone see in the theater. Wait for Redbox.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Very well done. Packageing and shipment was beyond expectation. Watch it with my grandkids and they really enjoyed it as myself and my wife.
B00005T7I1|5.0|This is certainly one of those movies that grow on you over the years. No wonder it is still popular a decade and half later. Everything just comes together perfectly: absurd plot, overblown makeup, bright colors and Madonna songs. It is so corny (deliberately so), it's way cool. And it is American to the core.  In its genre, an absolute  masterpiece!
B008COD5OO|1.0|This movie is trying very hard to be superbad. Unfortunately, the character Costa is the most annoying whiney bitch ever, and unlike Jonah Hill's character in Superbad, completely unlikeable. This is unwatchable.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Jeremy Renner does a great job in this action packed movie.  His acting is superior, as well or better than Matt Damon did in the previous Bourne movies.  It's a nail biter from the beginning.  The scenery throughout is beautiful.  Chase scenes make you feel like you are on a roller coaster.  I highly recommend this movie if you are a \\"Bourne\\" fan!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What heartwarming wonderful story.  I do own a dog and the narration being a dog was a delight to read.  I found the book/story touched my heart and was left a bit of crying in the end. A MUST read. It was recommended to me by a friend and called her when I finished to thank her.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really wish I had learned more about this before I purchased it and I am sorry I have contributed to it's sales numbers. I had heard so much about it, I didn't even check in to what genre it was, it was being talked about as a Romance novel, \\"Jeez\\"! I think we should boycott the movie version. These earlier reviews are so well written I can not do them justice; much more enjoyable to read than the book and nice use of the Kindle \\"look-up\\" function. I don't know if this book's success should be discouraging to writers or encouraging. Certainly not encouraging to readers. I wish I had returned it within my 7 day window. Amazon needs a negative star rating for this.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot! Typically the cheaper kindle books can be just what you paid for cheap and cheesy! This kept me reading and I enjoyed the story. The ending was a little far fetched but it worked. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quick light love story.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Bottom line: Buy this set. You will not be disappointed. With a price tag for four (arguably 8 movies, by the time you count alternate versions), which ranged from $30 to $40, ROI is a moot point, even if you already own the DVD versions.<br /><br />I won't repeat technical info you'll find elsewhere. I'll also throw in a minor disclaimer: I watched these on a 60 inch screen, so the 1080p picture quality, which blew me away on Alien, may not be as significant on smaller screens.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|it worked good for about a week... then a film part on it broke.. from the inside. so I don't know how that happened. but it's not so water proof anymore.
B000RIY27M|5.0|The show itself is awesome, I love it. The storyline is great, it's a nice tie-in to SG-1. Having a few crossovers here and there in both series makes it feel like they are part of the same universe. Only character that didn't show up that would have been nice to see is O'Neill, he's hilarious, and I think a mission with him and Sheppard would have been a hilarious episode, given they are both smart asses in the face of danger. The Wraith however, could have been something more original than, well, let's face it, vampires. Overall, I'd recommend this show to anyone.<br /><br />On a side note, Amazon really needs to rethink how they release videos for Amazon Prime. I can watch all but 4 episodes on my Xbox, the rest are standard definition that I have to watch on my computer. In my opinion, release all episodes in the same definition for the same service (Prime in this example), or not at all until all episodes are stored in the company library.<br /><br />Also, Prime/Instant video is in serious need of a subtitle service. Room mates are getting tired of me having to crank the volume to hear what they are saying on screen =/

0316017930|5.0|I first read this book some years ago and was most impressed.  These ideas are not new but laid out in the manner of this book brings a new urgency to the teaching of our children..  Even MENSA  has published an article that \\"\\"grit\\" is as important as brain power.  I have given a copy to my grandson as he leaves for university shortly in the hope that it will inspire him to work as did, say,Bill Gates.  This is an excellent book and well worth the read for anyone with aspirations of improvement for self or others.  Maybe it should be HS senior mandatory reading.

0345803485|1.0|I initially had no intentions of reading this book even though one of my friends said it was a great story but the writing was bad (she is a high school English teacher).  I am an avid romance reader and thought this book just didn't seem to be of interest to me.  Then one of my guy friends said he met a woman who had been reading Fifty Shades of Grey and they hooked up because of it.  That made me say, \\"Maybe it's worth the read.\\"<br /><br />So I rent the book from the library and commence reading.  The book had so much interest that two of my other friends started to read the book at about the same time.  The book seemed to pick up interest at about Chapter 7, or so I thought, but I guess in retrospect it just started to prove how bad a book could get.  My two friends just couldn't take the torture and waited for me to tell them what happened.  For the life of me I can't understand how or why there is even a book two or three (I read those as well).  If the author would have taken all the repetition out of all three books and combined them into one, it quite possibly could have been one decent book.  As others have said, it seems as though a 16 year old wrote the book with a bunch of the same phrases being pasted every other page.  I got so tired of every other page being a sex seen and reading silly emails! I didn't know how much I hated the word 'Jeez' until I felt like over 3 books I read it almost 300 times.<br /><br />I don't really recommend this book to anyone.  I give the first book 1 star because it was better than the last two.  If you have friends that have dared to read all three (I was the guinea pig for my friends) then I recommend you save some time and just ask them what happens.  I can't figure out how they will ever make a movie of this mess; it could only be about a 30 minute show.
0312335164|4.0|As I received the book in the summertime, on July 10, 2012, I am so busy doing thing I normally cannot do due to a lack of sunshine so...in regard to the two book order:  haven't had time to review or read either!
0071752854|5.0|I found book informative for the person doing the pitching.  It gives some important tips as to how to present and boost your chances of being heard.
0553278398|4.0|This may have been a five-star book if I had read it before reading the original trilogy. However, I did read the original trilogy first, all three of which are excellent books. Perhaps my rating isn't entirely fair, as I can't help comparing this book to those three.<br />This book does have all the same elements as the first three: lots of dialogue, although not as much as the first three, and a nice amount of adventure/action, though once again, not as much as the first three. Also, while the orginal trilogy has such a unique style to them (almost 90% dialogue and more than one story per book), this is more of a standard novel, focusing on a few main characters. It's not good or bad I guess, just different than the style of the originals.<br />The only real issue I had with this book (why I rated four stars), is that it details so much that seems uneccesary. All of the information in this book, and the extra details, are far more than a reader would remember, and I felt it slowed the pace of the book down at times.<br />I was thinking of giving the book three stars, however...the first one hundred and the last twenty pages are pure greatness. The beginning sets it up for the reader to take a highly entertaining journey, and the ending all but demands you read the book that follows this (which I will do).<br />Overall, I would still recommend this book, as the fun adventurous moments certainly outweight the slow spots, but I would HIGHLY reccomend the original trilogy.
B000CC2CUW|4.0|I am not reviewing the movie.<br /><br />I am just saying that when my collection of VHS tapes became old and the analog magnetic media was faltering due to playback, I wanted to get digital of my old movies. But new Disney movies are about $20 even when used.<br /><br />When Disney movies first came out you could spend up to $100 to get a video that went back in the Disney vault.<br /><br />Well, same thing is happening with DVD, while we wait for the videos to come out on Blu-ray.<br /><br />So my solution is to seek out the older videos on the stable LaserDisc format, they are digital and usually disney videos are not subject as much to Laser Rot that damaged discs (there are resources to check if the LD was subject to laser rot)<br /><br />So I get the classics in digital about 425 lines of resolution as opposed to VHS which is about 220 lines.  Not as good as DVD or Blu-ray but great for watching my favorite Disney Video's again, without spending tons of money.

B006SAR6P8|5.0|There are enough reviews for the movie.<br /><br />I am just saying the Blu-ray had great features to watch and really added to the video experience.  The Robert Rodriguez sound track and live performance was Awesome.<br /><br />If you like Kill Bill get the Blu-ray, the HD and extra features are worth it.
B000WTXEAM|5.0|All Things Must Pass was, of course, George's greatest album. i find myself skipping some songs on ATMP though. Living In The Material World gets a full play through from me every time. I love every song and some are leftover from ATMP. the bonus tracks For You Blue is a great George ukelele? type bluesy number. A b-side to Bangla Desh (which should have been a bonus track) Miss O'Dell i feel could have been a great George song. Saturated by Dylan influence but an obvious out-take as George cracks up throughout the recording. He really should have finished this song.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|before i bought this pair of shoes i was using the sketcher slip resistant line of shoes. Compared to my old pair this shoes the slip resistant is not as good since i find my self slipping from time to time. One more thing that i dont like is the fact that your feet will sweat a lot since it has no breathing at all. Keep in mind that while your feet get use to the shoes it might cause blisters (very minor) other than that they are supper comfortable. I love how i can work 12 hrs shifts and my feet wont feel nearly as tired as they did when using other shoes. They are super light also. They really are made for standing on your feet for long periods of time.
B008MEM24S|1.0|what a rip off because on Disney channel it said that it was free! come on app store you can do better by not ripping us of!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a very good game or games..  but it does take awhile for u to unlock the games and that is annoyin
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time and a good antidote to all of the mindless, predictable films out there. Yes, it's slow, but never boring. I loved the grittiness and the fact that the characters are not just cardboard cut-out good guys and bad guys. I read in a one-star review that the characters suddenly change at the end and start caring, but this just isn't true. Everyone Ree meets tries to help her in their own way and they are all touched by her plight, even though they don't want her to dig any deeper to find out where her father is.<br /><br />There is menace and violence in this society which clings to the edges of civilization, but there is also humanity (seen in the treatment of animals, apart from the squirrels who are killed for food, not sport). I'm glad the film ended the way it did because I was expecting some blood-splattered finale that just never eventuated.  It's a film about people living with poverty and addictions, and getting by as best they can with their own code of honour. Despite its bleak subject matter it finishes on a hopeful note which was very refreshing.
B001KQEE0U|1.0|When both cd's are advertised I assume I get both, guess not. Amazon I want half my purchase price or the other half of my cd.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun way to kill time also something to let your child play while your busy......but some games are just plain boring but Finn :)
B008EL4YX6|4.0|This game doesn't have the high-end graphics other games have, but that kind of adds to the charm. And it doesn't take away from the quality of gameplay at all. Some levels seem to be impossible because there just isn't any way to get the 'dot' to move in from the direction needed, so don't beat yourself up, this game lets you skip levels. I'm glad it was the faotd or I never would have tried it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game to pass time.  Quick levels.  Challenging without being impossible. Easier levels even good for young children.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|I wrote a less than complimentary review of the \\"Bat\\" and assumed the Bat Pod would be of equal quality. I was pleasantly surprised by this one! The plastic is not brittle and the design of the detachable armor is quite functional. The included Batman is not posable beyond the swivel of the arms. This makes getting him one the batpod easier and there is a clip that keeps him there. His hands are in a closed circle so that he hangs on handle bar grips well. The size of the tires are wide enough to keep the pod upright in most circumstances. This toy is money better spent than on the disappointing Bat. Son and I are both happy!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I plugged this into my Macbook Air and it just worked. The internet is noticeably faster on this than the Air's wifi connection.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|The most fun I've had with an action puzzle game since Frozen Bubble. This game admirably demonstrates the core principle shared by classics like Tetris and Pipe Dream- a simple game is not necessarily an *easy* game. Unlike those classics, the atmosphere in Ichi is relaxed. Rather than throw random pieces at you to test both your wit and your reactions at the same time, Ichi lays the level out in front of you to study and plan before you enter the active phase of the game. The music compliments the gameplay with a relaxed, yet upbeat melody that fits the tone perfectly. I don't give out five star reviews lightly, but this one has earned it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like these games... its really addicting just tryingg to get to the next set. I catch myself playing for hours
B007VUA7VO|5.0|So cool.....actually works! I love how the battery is like bubbling! It tells you how much battery you have left and other cool random things!! I recommend this app!
B001R4MEYS|5.0|Along with bands such as Lamb Of God, Machine Head and Trivium, Mastodon is one of the greatest and most creative bands in American Metal scene nowadays. Its previous releases are among the best albums in the last years (\\"Leviathan\\" and \\"Blood Mountain\\" are both excellent works), and with \\"Crack The Skye\\" it doesn't change.<br /><br />The new album follows a more Progressive, atmospheric and epic direction, without giving up its musical identity, through seven awesome and balanced songs of Sludge, Progressive Rock, Stoner and Heavy Metal.<br /><br />This special edition of \\"Crack The Skye\\" contains a DVD that comes with an amazing (and hilarious) documentary about the making of the album, very important for those who wants to understand a little more about the band and their new musical direction.
031620157X|1.0|I saw all the five star reviews for this featured and was so excited to get into it because I love fairytales.  The opening prologue was very intriguing and I found that where the story revolved around the fairytale characters alone then it was stronger than his writing of the twins plot line which is the majority of the book. The writing was awful and sickeningly sweet. I would have stopped reading but I'm one of those people who persist regardless so could not wait for it to be over. I kept cringing at the writing or rolling my eyes at how easily things came to them. It seemed like an attempt to cram the book with all the popular fairytale characters you know. Characters were one dimensional and the thread of the story did not make any sense either.<br /><br />Everything that happened to them was just too neat which is a sign of lazy storytelling. They get kidnapped by trolls and goblins and their fellow inmates despair and tell them it's useless but within minutes of being locked in they are saved by a stupid she-troll. There was never any moment where I got carried away with the story because as a challenge befell them I knew they would get out of it in the next paragraph! At one stage in the book, Alex was asking the Little Mermaid why she was helping them and she said it was just because she's good. All the main fairytale characters who meet them instinctively trust them and help straight away even though the kids are essentially stealing from them.<br /><br />There are so many other wonderful children fantasy stories out there (Diana Wynne Jones is a particular favourite) and it seems a waste that something like this was published. Had the author not been famous I doubt it would have happened.
B005CMSDKA|1.0|Horrible. This movie sucks and was a huge waste of time. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money. Buy Killer Klowns From Outer Space instead on blu ray.
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|The gun is pretty bad, to say the least. It is small, bulky, and awkward to shoot. The way that the clips revolve is pretty cool, the concept is great, but the asthetics are crap. The RoF is great, I like the ranges, but this gun just isn't for me. If you want a gun that peppers but has terrible accuracy. buy this. If you want a great slamfire gun that has great ranges and accuracy, buy the Pyragon. Just my 2 cents.
034580404X|4.0|Excellent read!  Hard to put the books down.  I love the story and action in this book.  A little too much sex, beyond mortally possible, for my taste.  Few annoying repeated phrases throughout the book and some word choices are confusing, like the fact she calls the vagina her sex.  Other than that, a must read!
B001AQT0UY|4.0|First off let me say the first time I saw this movie I was around 5 or 6 & it scared the living daylights out of me. I am now a 22 year old woman & the gremlins series are two of my favorite \\"scary movies\\" I watch them every time I see they are on, laugh the entire time I watch them, & will be buying this movie. For all the people complaining about how bad the acting is & blah blah blah guys this movie was made in 1984 not 2004 & is supposed to be a raunchy,comedic, semi-horror movie. Is it scary? Heck yes it's scary, the first time you watch it. If you show it to your kids they're probably gonna have some problems sleeping for a few nights, but guess what my parents told me when I got like that when I was younger? \\"It's just a movie, go to sleep. *turns lights out*\\" Guess what? I learned to tell myself it's just a movie (even if I had to say it to myself 2000 times til I passed out)& go to sleep, the next morning I would wake up smiling because nothing happened to me & realized that scary movies are just that, movies. They're not real. & I'm fine now, no therapy, no irrational fears of the dark, no dreaming about Gremlins coming to get me. If anything this movie's a lesson in following instructions, Peter was clearly told not to get it wet or feed it after midnight & he did anyways soooo it's kinda his fault things went sour. The 80s and 90s were full of movies & shows that didn't have cheery songs & happy go lucky characters in them that although frightening we still appreciate now. I watched Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Child's Play, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Candyman and Pumpkinhead & I screamed  and hid under the covers every time but I loved every second of it just as much as I loved Disney movies. Stop babying your kids, being afraid isn't going to kill them.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I've had this adapter for about a year now, and I've never experienced a problem with it.<br /><br />I know many complain that Apple MacBook designs require the user to  purchase these extra parts, but I'm not here to comment on this issue- I'm here to explain that this product works well for me.<br /><br />I bought this adapter when I acquired a ViewSonic 1080p LED screen, and wanted to hook up my 2008 MacBook to it. I called up the Apple store, told them which computer I have, and they recommended this product. I highly recommend asking the Apple store which product to get, as I've seen enough people leaving comments here that they've purchased the wrong adapter. Anyway, Apple recommended this product, and I purchased it. Since then, I've avoided bending the adapter in any unusual way, and it has worked for me ever since, with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />I bought the adapter at the Apple Store, which set me back $18 or so. I see that Amazon lists it for a little less, so you're getting a bargain if you buy it here.<br /><br />I hope this helps. Please comment if you have any questions or concerns.
B000059TFO|5.0|I remember the headlines of this sad story back in the day and this really presents it realistically. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believed this is a bestseller!!!!! two weeks and I still can't finished the first book. I started to read it because people at work were talking about how good it was, their reviews were entertaining and it was highly recommended on tv and media. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!!! ITS AWFUL!!! So repetitive that its tiring, like it was written by a middle schooler with limited English knowledge. At least that's my perception and my first language is Spanish!!!! Sorry by the exclamation points but its really a terrible book to read, storyline seems entertaining but the writing is a turn off.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|This was one of the most entertaining books I've read. Couldn't put it down. If you enjoy wild stories of wall street excess, this book is for you.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I really I love the 10th Doctor. David Tennant is the best I believe. I've watch it since Christopher and I am currently watch Matt Smith and although they are great Doctor's, they do not stand up to David Tennant's portrayal of the great man. The only thing that confused me with one of the episodes particularly \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" is why after she regenerated how comes she has yet to run into her father? Even though he has changed form I believe he still knows that the had a daughter. She is out there bouncing around the universe and he has yet to run into her..I believe not. Hopefully we will see her again.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Can't believe the hype.  This is a very poor book, don't waste your time or your hard earned cash.  There are many better authors out there more deserving of your money
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another great book by Baldacci!!! I love his stories and style of writing.  The characters - Robie and Julie - are likeable and well developed.  Baldacci gives good descriptions without getting bogged down in meaningless info.  The plot is typical Baldacci - twists, turns, thrills, excitement - a fantastic roller coaster ride of a book that I found impossible to put down.  I definitely recommend this book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This review is for the series, not just book one.  I was skeptical at first.  I don't care for such explicite sexual content.  But I was too curious because of the reviews from friends and online. E.L. James  does an amazing job of connecting you emotionally with Ana and Christain.  I absolutely loved reading the way their relationship developed.  I had to reread the series immediately.  I would caution the reader as to the sexual content, but the series is truly amazing.  I know I will read it again....hope you enjoy as well!
B0055SWM08|4.0|great for lazy afternoon. nice graphics, music is relaxing. thought provoking game. not too terribly tough.<br /><br />great for all ages.

B005HJWWW8|1.0|First off I will say that I have much experience with Fiio products.  I've used<br />an E5 for years and been happy with it.  Thought I'd try the E6 because of it's<br />extra features.  After using it I'm very disappointed with the battery life.  I<br />use it for exercising and work out for anywhere from 1 - 3 hours sometimes.  Anything<br />over 1 hour is very iffy as to whether the battery is going to last for me.  Today<br />I worked out for 1.75 hours and it died after about 70 minutes.  This is totally un-<br />satisfactory for me and I will be looking for how to get a replacement for this unit.<br />I'm not sure whether it's my unit or all of them but the old E5 that I have will give<br />me many hours of music so I have a feeling I got a bad one.  I will be returning here<br />to follow up on this review.<br /><br />EDIT:  See my edited comments below for an update on this product.  I would now<br />rate it closer to 5 stars.

B003R0LBVW|3.0|ine years after his last novel, The Corrections, wowed the literary scene, Jonathan Franzen is back. His new novel, Freedom, was eagerly anticipated for months before its release, and quickly made numerous \\"best\\" lists. And while there's absolutely no disputing his ability to examine the modern American family, for me, this book fell short of topping his previous achievement.<br /><br />Patty and Walter Berglund are a happily and proudly liberal married couple in Minnesota. Patty, a former college basketball star, has spent most of her marriage taking care of the couple's two children, while upright Walter, a proud feminist and champion of equal rights, works at 3M. But while the Berglunds seem like the perfect family to the outside world, their son's decision to move in with their conservative next-door-neighbors and abandon his family triggers a chain reaction of crises and recriminations that shakes the entire family to its core. The book follows the stories of Patty, Walter, their son, Joey, and Walter's college roommate, erstwhile rock singer Richard Katz, whose presence in the Berglunds' lives is both welcomed and resented. And where each individual winds up is very different from where they started out.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book. While Franzen has a unique ability to make you care about unsympathetic characters, I found there were too many in this book to get emotionally invested in. You get to understand what makes each character tick (in tremendous detail), but even knowing what they've been through didn't make me warm to them completely. And in many situations, Franzen went way overboard in his exploration of certain narrative threads (Joey's strange relationship with his girlfriend, Walter's obsession with preservation of an endangered bird and with population control) to the point where I nearly lost interest. There was never a doubt in my mind that Franzen is a great writer; however, in this book, his strength as a storyteller didn't quite register for me as it has in the past. Some have loved this book and some have hated it; I fall somewhere in between.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|Was dissapointed in this movie. It is depressing and not really scary. Thought I would give it a try. I liked some of his other movies better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book in the Hunger Games trilogy really wowed me. I was impressed by Hunger Games, the first book in the series, when I read it earlier this year, but Collins definitely outdid herself with this second book. It's amazing how well-written and intricately plotted a book this is, considering that many books traditionally geared for the \\"young adult\\" audience skimp a bit on quality. (Haters: I said many, not all.)<br /><br />When the first book in the series ended, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark had emerged victorious from the annual Hunger Games, a government-sanctioned, brutal fight-to-the-death that pitted two young people from each district against each other. Katniss outsmarted the Capitol by ensuring that two people survived the Games for the first time, and this has caused ripples of rebellion to ignite all over the country. So the Capitol enacts its revenge by turning Katniss' world upside down, throwing her challenge after challenge, and putting all those she loves at risk. (This is a super general description because so much of the book works when it comes as a surprise.)<br /><br />What impressed me about these books is Collins' creativity in dreaming up the setting, the Hunger Games and the characters, as well as the maturity her characters showed. These aren't sniveling, whining, pining people (most of the time) and you find yourself getting truly emotionally invested in what happens to them.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I overall liked it at first. then after a few months, it decided to not work or download anything. I'm really confused because I really liked it at first..
B001NLKT60|5.0|You've got to love books that make you stay up as late as necessary to finish them. Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Played with Fire, second in the \\"Millennium Trilogy,\\" was one of those books for me. And much like many other series of novels I've read, Larsson definitely hit his stride with this book. While the first book in the series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was tremendously gripping and well-written, it definitely suffered a bit from an overload of details that didn't necessarily move the plot forward. But this book, while starting a bit slow, was definitely stronger than its predecessor.<br /><br />Reporter Mikael Blomkvist is working with a freelance journalist on an article and book exposing sex trafficking in Sweden, a problem that has reached epidemic proportions and involved politicians, judges and policemen. Just before the article and book are to be published, the journalist and his girlfriend (on whose doctoral dissertation the expos&eacute; is based) are murdered. The suspect in these brutal murders, as well as one additional murder, is Lisbeth Salander, Blomkvist's socially awkward yet brilliant sometime-friend and researcher. Blomkvist is convinced of Salander's innocence even while the facts against her are mounting, and he defies the police and other enemies to try and figure out who really murdered his friends, while at the same time, forces from Salander's past are trying to remove her from the picture for good.<br /><br />This book read like a movie. The action is great, some of the twists actually made me gasp, and Larsson never lets his main characters be one-dimensional. If you're like me and usually shy away from the books everyone else on Earth is reading, take my advice: read this one.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have listened to this on both 5.1 surround sound and pure stereo and either way, this mix is pure unabashed genius.  The remix of these incredible songs results in an out of body experience where indeed, only love resides.<br /><br />Give your heart and those you love in your life a very special gift.  If I could afford it, I'd buy one for every person on the planet.  Yes, it's that good !!!<br /><br />Peace
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When reading a series of books, I'm always faced with a bit of a dilemma: do I tear through all of them quickly, leaving myself with nothing, or do I savor each book slowly and space out my reading of each one, so I keep having something to look forward to? Despite the excitement around their publication, I had avoided reading the last book in both Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy and Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy, but could only hold out so long...<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen has now survived two iterations of the Hunger Games, a government-sanctioned battle to the death that pits young adults from each area of the fractured republic of Panem against each other. Technically, only one winner is supposed to emerge from each Hunger Games, but Katniss and others have survived thanks to strength, ingenuity and more than a little manipulation. Now the republic is seeing the first seeds of rebellion manifest themselves, and the Capitol has little choice to fight back against the rebels, who view Katniss as their inspiration. As the lives of those she cares about are in jeopardy, she has no choice but to join the rebellion.<br /><br />I'm trying to keep the plot description fairly general so as not to be a spoiler for those who haven't read any or all of the books. I really thought this was a terrific series, and while this book was definitely bleaker and a bit more expository than action-oriented, it proved a fitting conclusion. Many of the characters are much more layered than you think at first glance, and Collins does a great job handling both action scenes and quieter, more introspective ones. The world she has created is a fascinating one, and I look forward to seeing how Hollywood continues to interpret it. I am sad, however, to say goodbye to Katniss and company.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|Jack just turned five years old. To celebrate, he and his mother play games, watch TV, eat cake and his mother measures his growth progress by marking his height on the wall. Sounds like a great birthday, doesn't it? The only thing is, Jack has never been outside the storage shed where he and his mother are being held captive. In fact, Jack was born in Room (his name for the shed) and his mother was kept there for two years before his birth. Their captor, whom they call Old Nick, brings things they need--food, clothing, the occasional book or toy--but Jack has to sleep in Wardrobe when Old Nick comes late at night.<br /><br />This is a tremendously affecting story of the amazing love a mother has for her child, creating a whole world in just one room. Jack doesn't know what's outside Room and doesn't really care; it's not until he turns five that his mother starts to plan how Jack can be used to free them from captivity. The challenge is that neither of them truly understand what being free would really mean to them--the world outside of Room proves to be even more threatening in some ways than being held captive did.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a great deal, even if at times it was a bit predictable. The only adjustment that needed to be made was that the entire story is told from Jack's point of view, so at times the narrative is hard to follow given his unique grasp of language. But I constantly marveled at the world Emma Donoghue created for Jack and Ma in Room, and then I wondered if something like this could actually be happening just under our noses. Wow, what a book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it laged ahem I played and froze it is still a great game still I like the charectors powers just u need a lot of power to let it attack
B007XNAOS0|4.0|Baroness keeps evolving; from the EPs to their first full length in the Red album, then again in their Blue album. As much as I, like many fans, wanted to see another Blue album if you look at any interviews Baroness has put out they felt they needed to add another layer of something different into their repertoire of music. And even though I didn't think they needed this at first, after listening to the Yellow and Green double album, I now agree.<br /><br />SO... this is a much bigger risk than what they've tried before. And like many of the good metal bands that have tried to evolve in their most recent albums, Baroness doesn't do it quite perfectly. It takes multiple listens over a long time to appreciate what they've done, much like their other albums. The highlights of this album for me are mostly on the Yellow album: \\"March to the Sea\\", \\"Back Where I belong\\", \\"Sea Lungs\\",  \\"The Line Between\\", and the best song on the album \\"Eula\\". For the most part, these are songs that sound somewhat like their older albums albeit more straight forward. Eula is the best of their attempts to expand their sound and in this case they've created a song that slowly builds on itself and is slightly reminiscent of something like a Pink Floyd song. Lyrically, Baroness has always had some interesting words and I think they have a few songs (March to the Sea and Eula) that are actually really great lyrically. But they've chosen to do more \\"singing\\" on this album (as opposed to the yell/scream type singing) which makes the lyrics more easily understood (although not in always in their meaning) and this brings the strangeness of some of their lyrics to the front.<br /><br />The low points of this double album come mostly on the Green album. The worst songs are probably \\"Mtns.\\" and \\"Psalms Alive\\" for a lot of the same reasons. I'm not sure what kind of sound they are going for on these two songs but they both are pretty over-the-top with strange styles and the singing is screwed with toomuch. The singing and the playing are a bit over-produced throughout the whole double album.  Songs like \\"Board up the House\\" and \\"The Little things\\" are held back from being amazing because of this very reason. For the most part, I don't like what they've done with the singing. I understand the yelling/screaming has gotten hard on Baizley's voice so moving to more \\"singing\\" is necessary but they need to keep themselves from screwing with it too much album-wise. I think their voices would actually sound better with a more natural sound.<br /><br />This writing of this album also manages to remove some of the complexity of their previous albums, which I am disappointed to see. I felt on the Blue album they had reached pretty much a perfect equilibrium of complex song framework and playing without sacrificing emotion in their songs. They've also decided here to mix the guitars out of the forefront of the songs for some reason which I will never understand. The guitar work is still got their signature duel and interweaving melodies but now it's just harder to hear. I just feel overall the mixing and production was better on the Blue and Red albums.<br /><br />If there is any indication that they made the right choice to evolve, it is the song \\"Take my Bones away\\" which sounds like it could be taken straight from the Blue album... It's a great song but if they had released an album full of songs like that, I'm sure I would have been bored with the sound. Instead they've taken their sound someplace new. I think they've now set themselves up with a large enough palette to create a masterpiece for their next album. And honestly, I can't wait to see them live again because I'm sure a lot of these songs are going to sound a million times better live (if you've never seen them live DO IT, they are pretty much the best band I've seen live).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A second book I cannot put down.  Certainly not Jane Austen!  I have the book on my Kindle and it is with me wherever I go.  Great lunch time reading at my favorite local cafe' accompanied by a nice glass of champagne.
B0089BSM70|4.0|This film is a worthy follow up to the classic film that preceded it. It was a great idea that the film makers not only set the story in the same night but also filmed in the exact locations as the previous film  The first 2 films flow together effortlessly.<br /><br />As the tag line states \\"More of the Night He Came Home\\".  In this outing we learn the reason why Michael Myers is in town.  The movie does have graphic violence (something the original left to your imagination) and its controversial because of the fact that it is rumored that the film was taken away from the director (Rick Rosenthal)  in post production and John Carpenter (The Original Directer of Halloween I) re-shot a few things and added graphic insert shots.<br /><br />If your a fan of Horror films I beg you to watch this after you watch the Original \\"Halloween\\".  I also beg of you to stay away from the Rob Zombie films!  They are garbage.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|some old games I haven't seen in years with a little twist. We compete for high scores on some of the difficult games.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|When out &amp; about and you want to make a shot look great or add some fun, PicShop is the way to go. Easy to use and great results, you can't go wrong. Now get it and start having even more fun with your photos.
B007CBEO20|5.0|Hard to comeby album at your local record store, good thing amazon had it.  Simply good music for old fans and new alike.  Honestly, my favorite Europe albums have been the past 3, not the 80s & 90s work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is worth many hours of fun. It is easy to earn new games with the polnts you earn if you play the game a lot. Some are not fun but most of them are. I would reccomend it to friends.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|very nice! This app got my whole family to sleep last night. I for one stayed asleep and woke up refreshed after batteling a migraine all night.
0439023491|4.0|After winning the Hunger Games, Katniss's life should be one of ease and comfort, but still she is more concerned about providing for everyone around her. When the next contestants for the games are announced, everyone is shocked that the past year's winner's are being called back into the arena to fight again. The Districts are boiling under the fierce control of the Capitol and while the contestants are fighting for their lives in the games, the citizens are planning their own fight. How many lives are in jeopardy now and who will pay the price?<br /><br />For some reason, this time the Hunger Games didn't feel so treacherous, but there's safety in numbers. Not quite the heart-stopper that Hunger Games was, but it does keep the story going and the pace quick.
B0013O123Q|4.0|This film is not for the squeamish. Most scenes are quite graphic and depending on one's morals, disturbing. The acting is so real. It shows the depravity some slip into. It shows the depravity a moral society should not slip into, for any reason. It is raw. Rating is definitely double R, if not triple (R).
1400032717|4.0|Autistic Christopher decides to figure out who killed the neighbor's dog and keeps a log about his findings. What the reader finds is the strain of raising an autistic child created a tangled web of frustration and sadness on his separated parents who desperately seek some sort of normalcy to their lives.<br /><br />Very enlightening as to the workings of the autistic mind. This book has been reviewed as accurate by other autistic individuals.  Deeper than it appears, sad tale about difficult lives.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My first Stephen King book. A very compelling read. The ending was a slight letdown but well worth the effort
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It really makes you think about whats going on around you in your day to day life.  Lauren Oliver does an excellent job at getting you to understand the dialy life and culture of the people in the book. Its definatly on my top 10 list.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Amazing spiderman and this one I compared it I think there about d same.  Oh and its awesome Cuz u can ride the batthingy :3
B00447G29S|5.0|We watch this movie every year at Christmas and finally decided to get the 3d version. I am definitely glad I did. We were very happy with the 3d effects. We really enjoyed the scenes where you felt like you were riding a roller coaster. Buy this today.
0307592731|4.0|but I really enjoyed it and admired her her tenacity. A funny and heartbreaking journey of a broken woman that showed just how resilant the human spirit is and when challenged can over come most anything.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|My wife has loved this movie for a long time. It is a family tradition to watch this movie ever year at Christmas, was very excited to see it coming out on blu-ray. Will update review if video/audio isn't up to par.
B0001I561E|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and was in great condition. My children love the movie and ask to watch it all the time.
B006JSXYPA|4.0|Upgraded to the 3d version from the regular blu-ray. It wasn't bad but at the same time I can't say that I would make the jump to the 3d version again. If you don't already own TF3 then definitely buy this version, but if you already own the blu not sure I would pull the trigger again.
0439023513|2.0|This book left me feeling empty and depressed. It took page after page describing Katniss' depressing situation towards the end, and then crudely tried to bring conclusions (or didn't even try, in some cases) to all of the different character story lines that we've come to care about the past 3 books. I liked Hunger Games, was even more impressed with Catching Fire, and was enjoying this book until things began to fall apart the last portions of the story. It felt like there was no payoff that I had been waiting for ever since I began the series. Seriously disappointed
B005HS4CUY|4.0|I already own the Toy Story Trilogy on regular blu ray but wanted the 3d versions so thought this would be a good addition. The colors on this are still beautiful but was a little disappointed in the 3d. At first I thought maybe it was just the TS1 but even TS3 just didn't really make me say wow the way Lion King did or some others. I would still purchase again but just might want to temper your expectations.
B004LROMWU|1.0|I keep watching hoping that this show gets better, I keep watching?  This show is getting worse.  Each episode continues to drag the viewer around looking for some meaning.  The plot has gone downhill.  What's next, lesbian love scenes?  Just like Stargate Universe, sex is the only way to save this series.  There is no later....
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good as the first.  I have not seen the movie yet.  I do not know how the movie could capture this book.  I recommend this to any SciFi fan, but not kids.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Game force closes EVERY time.  Please fix.  Looks like game could be fun if I could get a chance to play it.  Droid X2.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I originally thought this was going to be mommy porn. I was wrong. It's porn for everybody! Incredible Book! Book 2 isn't as good.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I got this book because I really enjoyed the Fifty Shades trilogy.  I also enjoyed this but it didn't quite grab me the way I thought it would.  Maybe if I read it long after Fifty Shades I might have enjoyed it more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|the game is really fun at first but you have to spend real money to really keep up with the city. in the beginning i had no coins to build anything and later, i had no energy to keep up with the upgrades. its also frustrating that you have to collect the papers through social media.
B00130UFY2|5.0|I just love this movie which is so distinct from 007 series. I watched it over three times! Especially love the chasing scene in that market.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game actually sucked me in pretty quickly. was easy to learn and get immersed in. This game will definitely take a significant portion of my free time.
0312944926|1.0|I was excited to read this book about cryptology, but it is probably one of the worst thrillers I have ever read. I'm only reading it because I already bought it. The main character is a girl with an IQ of 170 and she can't understand that somebody might have developed an unbreakable code. Her boy friend can't even get the common sense caution straight.<br /><br />What a disaster! Don't buy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple to learn but very challenging to master. It is an excellent puzzle game with tons of levels to keep you busy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this book it keeps you interested the entire time. I couldn't put it down. I read it in 2 days!!!
B0024FADAQ|5.0|A great family movie.  It will keep your attention.  It has some comedy just at the right times to keep it intresting.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I am a fan of Drew Barrymore ever since ET. She has grown into a fine actress and as Cinderella, is at her best. She turns the fairy tale into a realistic portrayal of the life of an orphan in midieval times. Her Prince, portrayed by Dougray Scott, is a fine actor, a breath of fresh air and masculine scent, handles his role with dignity and fervor. I have watched this movie several times, and will watch it again.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|After all the hype, I caved and downloaded the first book, and from that moment forth, became one of the masses, and addicted. I've never been a voyeur kind of person, and my personal sex life, well, the fantasy of being tied is one thing, doing it is another, but the writing, the frankness, the 'being able to picture it' was fascinating to say the least. It made it hard to put down, and of course, encouraged me to download the next two books which took me 2 days to reach each one (I work full time, and part time ... amazing what you can fit in when you need to).<br /><br />If you want to read exotic erotica, some hardcore stuff, some softcore stuff and some just plain ol' fashioned nooky, then this is the book for you. Monsieur Grey, for all his domineering ways, is really a big softie who is hurting ... its beautiful how he trusts this woman who has come into his life ... not what he expected. Not what SHE expected either. They make a great couple, chalk and cheese, but cheese and biscuits at the same time.<br /><br />Read it. Just do it.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|If the cuss word vocabulary does not offend you, this scifi movie is grounded in social/ religious/ governmental issues that are presented in a palatable manner through Paul, the very astute and \\"down to earth\\" (pardon the pun) Alien. The humor is subtle. I had to watch the movie twice, and will watch it again to catch all the innuendos.  I was fully entertained by this movie.  Never a dull moment.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun fun fun!!!<br />having a funtasticly fun time with this funtastically fun game.  hope you will have fun also.  I hope
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Have been using this app for about a year now and I have yet to find anything I don't like about it.  If you want a note taking app then look no further than Evernote.  You will not be disappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|so I downloaded this last night for my moms kindle fire, it took awhile but it worked today when I and my brother played it on a road trip. I loved it so I am downloading it now. I'm not sure why it wasn't working for everyone else. I love this app so much, usually apps like this are just a slight adaption from the original, and its so annoying, but I love this 10 times more than where's my water. its a great puzzle app for all ages, basically anyone who likes Perry will love this app!
B008MEM24S|1.0|I just saw the post from J. Agregory.. wish I would have read it first. If you have a kindle fire, this app will not download.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I have this show in three formats :Laser disc,DVD and now in Blu ray.<br />From now is possible to appreciate the atmosphere and the performance of the musicians.<br />Tony Levin,Paula Cole,David Rodes ,Jean Claude ,Shankar,Manu Katche(Perfect!!!!) are performing now in my living room and I was transported to Modena.<br />The sound restoration deep you in the same enviromental of the Modena arena.<br />Now is possible to see images details and complete shadow nuances.<br />Simply fantastic!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Love this game and cannot stop playing it. Great controls and love that you can configure your power ups. Highly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love flow. It is on my favorites page so I can get there easily any time I want to play.
0345803485|2.0|What I liked: I don't ordinarily read erotica, so let me preface my review with that disclaimer. That said, I am happy to report that the sex acts in this book weren't retold so explicitly that I had to skip those parts. The sex is, however, central to the story's progression, and perhaps the author attempts to use it to symbolize something bigger that two grunting bodies. (I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt here.)<br /><br />What I didn't like: A lot. Most everything, in fact. I read this book because it's so popular right now, and while I knew it was erotica, there is a lot of erotica out there, and so I expected something - grand. Above the crowd. Or at least really good.<br /><br />I didn't find it.<br /><br />Someone recently said of this book that it's like a teenage fantasy, and I think that nails it. Christian (Grey) is like 28 and a billion-billion-billionare? Really? With a really big penis? And he wants to dominate Ana's every move, in the bedroom and out?<br /><br />And she's a 22-year old, super-super naïve virgin who swoons at his feet every time he even looks her way?<br /><br />Oh - come on! Really? Really?!<br /><br />The writing isn't horrendous. The sentences don't all start with \\"She\\" and \\"He.\\" But the writing skill skids to a halt right there. The plot is ridiculously shallow. And every other sentence describes how Ana is biting her lip, doubting her self worth, and just generally debasing herself over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It's truly abysmal writing, and I sure wish I could get my ten bucks back.<br /><br />In sum: Yeah; the publisher was right. This story will stay with me forever. But then, so does taste aversion after a good food poisoning.<br /><br />If, like me, you just have to see what all the fuss is about, borrow the book from someone. For the love of God - don't buy it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it really works! it is very relaxing. the sounds are very authentic!  I normally have a hard time falling to sleep.  but this helps me float into a dream!  thumbs up :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first it didn't seem like it would hold my attention, but that changed as I advanced. It's fun for kids, at first, then addictive for mom and dad.
B004I744AS|5.0|fun to play some game also challenge me to think or figure it out. enjoy to read some history and learn vocabulary everyday.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  Unlike so many games, it has an untimed mode,  so you can concentrate all your efforts on figuring out the correct solution, rather than racing blindly against the clock. The game flows smoothly;-) and is a great way to unwind at the end of the day. I highly recommend this game for those who enjoy solving puzzles but don't necessarily want a frenetic pace. It reminds me of some of the brain -boosting games on Lumosity - I feel like I'm giving my brain a good workout if I play everyday.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This game is fun, however, since the day it was installed in have had over 20 updates. I makes the user wonder what is this app doing to your device. The game is fun but I think it was released to the public before it was working correctly. Keep in mind, if you download this app, you need to be ready to update it every other day, causing frustration and bad impression for the developer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome so make sure u get it because yoou can get a hundred Gama es om jnirfnuf fucj  hfjdb jn  uguyufj
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a great app which will fill some free time. reccommend this to any age and any device. seems simple.
B006VP1OYO|4.0|While I'm happy to have MBV's EPs in one place, I wish Kevin Shields had included their Wire cover \\"Map Ref. 41N 93W\\" as well as Andrew Weatherall's remix of \\"Soon\\" on the album. Then it would have truly been a 5 star compilation.
1475143389|5.0|This book is single most helpful piece of literature I've ever read about working out. The author provides detailed advice on diet, workout, and the mindset needed to achieve the goals one wants. Whether your goal is to bulk up, cut fat, or maintain a certain physique (while adding muscle) the book provides a successful plan and way to do so. The author is also extremely helpful and he answers all e-mails and questions within a very short period of time. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to set working out and I know that the book will bring forth great results.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|The only complaint I have about this book is it's over to quick! It's a great story. The characters are so loveable and you go through ever emotion while reading the book. I finished Slammed and immediately ordered the next book and cannot wait to start reading it.
B001NKI60W|5.0|After being so disappointed that half way through the DVD of Mamma Mia! it was sticking, I wanted to cry. But another DVD was quickly sent and I received it promptly.<br /><br />This service deserves five star satisfaction  -- buying used is always risky, but they gave me the confidence that I need not be fearful of any problems.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nice game. need to lower the cost of each game though ... I don't have patience to replay games 50 times until I can finally get a new one
B008EL4YX6|3.0|It's pretty freaking obvious most of these reviews are from the Devs or their affliates....that being said I automatically despised this app before trying it...<br /><br />But after giving it a try even with my bias in the beginning, it's actually not that bad and actually pretty fun.<br /><br />So disregard all the lame reviews, and give this an honest shot.
B008MEM24S|2.0|this is not the best I got agrivated if u were Perry what would u think? huh yea tell Mme bout that!!!  I didn't think so. Perry would die with pain.
B000FVE3A2|4.0|When the watch arrived, I was shocked by the weight of it. It is very heavy. Upon closer inspection the watch is built to last the case is very robust and exceptionally finished. The bracelet was way too big for my wrist, but I removed three links and adjusted the clasp position and now it fits perfectly. There was a problem while adjusting the clasp, when I popped the pin from the clasp, the end of the pin came out of the tube and pinged of never to be found again. I think that is pretty bad now I had useless bracelet. Fortunately I found an old busted watch which had a ping I could use.<br /><br />I really love that this watch has a screw down crown. The crown also has a nicely deep sea diver logo on it. Looks really cool.<br /><br />The finish detail,on this watch I awesome, especially for the price. I have not idea how they can produce such a high quality was for the money. The unidirectional bezel is very positive and the clicks are just spot on.<br /><br />The movement seem to keep very good time. With no problems so far. I am quite looking forward to seeing how it performs over a long period of time. I would have given this watch five stars if it had a hacking feature to assist in setting the seconds.<br /><br />I boughtt this watch for two reasons, my Rolex Air King if being fixed an I wanted a big chunky every day to wear willie I am waiting for my Rolex. The other reason is I wanted a decent but not too expensive diver watch. I am very pleased with the Invicta grand diver.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Four stars because of some of the difficulties getting connected to the computer. It also occasionally just shows a black screen but that is rare. I highly recommend linking with your gmail account as it streamlines the process. Once connect remotely this app makes it very easy to control!
B008MM9630|4.0|Very cute game.  Haven't been playing long but it's cute enough for great entertainment.  Grow crops and add lots of other design items along with animals trees and roads etc..
034580404X|5.0|Loved,loved,loved the books. If you can get through the 1st book you will<br />like the other 2. There is a good story in these books. I have read them twice<br />and now have bought all 3. At 1st when i started reading the seris i thought it was<br />somewhat like Twlight.
B000RD0RDU|1.0|Hooked this fan up and it worked like it said it would. However the next day I noticed that it wasn't spinning. I spun it by hand and then it started. I now have to do that every time to get it started. I will be returning this.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book was as entertaining as any that I have read by the author.  The mundane springs to life.  As a practicing physician I could relate to all of the scenarios that were put forth.  This book is a must read!
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I just love this film and as I get older I like it more and more. Even though I haven't worked in the USA for years and years, the years I have I can so relate to this film. When it first came out I loved it and now I use words like genius to describe it. Captures both the cooperate culture and chain restaurant industry so well it's almost scary.<br /><br />The story follows a group of people working at the lower corporate level a tech firm in the 90's. I just so happened to work for tech firms in the 90's and although all of them weren't like this, the majority were. But as long as you have worked at any business in the corporate office level you will get a kick out of this film. It covers all the normal office politics, annoying office mates, type A personalities, horrible upper management, worker bees and everyone else you will find in this environment.<br /><br />The main characters are a low lever programmer and his work mates. The main antagonist is of course the boss and his minions but its more a statement of a man exploring his place in life and where he really would like to be. And surprisingly his desire is not to be rich and powerful but just in a position to enjoy life at his own pace.<br /><br />There is also a peripheral character who works as a waitress at a chain restaurant similar to TGI Friday's or Applebee's. Anyone who has ever worked in the restaurant industry will really appreciate this story line and the truths it reveals through her tormentuous struggle.  Just brilliant!<br /><br />Also, I have to comment briefly on this version the Bluray, \\"with Flair\\" edition. Even a film of this calibre benefits from such a beautiful picture. They did a very nice transfer.<br /><br />I am not one of those people who like the commentary on most of these types of things but Mike Judge and the rest of the cast did a nice modern update for this edition and it was neither too long or self promoting. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />And lastly, the deleted scenes were really funny!<br /><br />Great Friday night film. Get some good snacks, some beers and prepare to laugh and cringe!s were really funny!<br /><br />Great Friday night film. Get some good snacks, some beers and prepare to laugh and cringe!
0345803493|2.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was worth the read. Couldn't put it down. Book 2:Shades Darker started to show the author's immaturity as a writer and a person. The author had a hard time filling up the pages for an interesting read. Too much repetition. The sex gets boring. I mean really....who has this much sex, even in a fictional story? Ridiculous.
B0013GH9AO|5.0|Absolutely amazing production, style, talent, and effort on this perfect album.  Dr. Dre truly is a perfectionist.  Detox will never come out.  That is all.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Book 2 went downhill for me, but this one takes the cake. I felt I had to read it just to see where this ridiculous relationship ends up. I should have known. So predictable. I cringed every time I read \\"Ah!\\", \\"Oh!\\", \\"Argh!\\" .....really? Ana's character becomes increasingly annoying in the last two books. I love the reviewers who've counted all the repetetive phrases and words. So true. And the torture doesn't end with the last chapter! There are totally unnecessary bonus chapters on Christian as a boy, and Christian's view of his first meeting with Ana.  Found myself skipping through so much of this book. I'm so glad to have been \\"freed\\" from this trilogy. What a waste of time.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|I really enjoy this app. but I play mine on my kindle fire. and some of the songs you need to press 3 keys at once and the kindle you can only press 2 keys at the same time. other than that I like it lots!
B005R4255C|5.0|Of course i prefer always original Michael's music. At the begining i didnt want to buy this CD, but i listened some very good remixes, where you MJ's essence remain..
B005LAII0S|1.0|This movie is absolutely terrible. It is a re-telling of the Snow White fairytale and unfortunately the script is just aweful. Surprisingly all the actors were bland, and just plain boring. Perhaps the bad script, in combination with poor directing? The movie never gives you that wow factor. What a shame. Save your money on this one.<br /><br />P.S. Im 31, and I didnt like it. My daughter is 14, and she didnt like it. And my son who is 12, says he really didnt care for it. We are looking forward to seeing Lily Collins in The Mortal Instruments movies, but Mirror Mirror was just bad :(
B0080R7O7W|5.0|I am a vynil fanatic, very happy for having this first released single of Bad 25. The B side... amazing as well. Very happy to buy it... and happy to have in my collection.
1439102813|5.0|What a frightening novel about the realities of Alzheimer's Disease - so important in its insightfulness of how a person falling into the clutches of the disease may view her world in decline. This is an easy-to-read book with tremendous lessons in compassion and understanding for those with growing and eventually debilitating incapacity.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|I gave this product 5 stars because it's pretty much the most essential compilation of Bananarama's entire body of work for any fan. I already own most of Bananarama's albums (all the 80s, early 90s and their latest one). I purchased this product mainly for the Music Videos DVD, however having the CD is nice as well since the sound quality seems updated from the original CDs (for example, the volume is higher than their original 80s CDs) and it includes all of my favorite singles. The music videos are great! I've always considered their visual image to be a major part of their appeal. That is not a bad thing at all (I love visual artists...) because the music is great by itself so they aren't just pretty faces, they are pretty faces with talent! Another great thing about the DVD is that it features more songs than the CD. Switching gears, even as a long time fan (I'm sure not as long as many others since I'm only 26, but a fan no less than 10 years) I picked up on a lot about Bananarama that I never quite saw before. They are quite fun and campy (in a good way) and never seem to take themselves too seriously. For instance, the video for Venus seemed comical and cute. As a child watching that video on MTV I mostly remember it being very glamorous and sexual, which it is, but there's more to it than that. They seem to be having pure yet cheeky fun with their image as sex symbols. Another thing I loved watching were the fashions of the times and how the band's image changed over time. They started off cool, tomboy-ish and more urban but then somewhere they seemed to flip the switch and they became hot, ultra-feminine and glamorous! Well, I know a bit how it happened... it goes with how their production and style of music changed (Stock Aitken Waterman anyone?)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|awesome app. relaxes me almost instantly.  decent choice of noises. the sound tones actually do seem to work. wish the thunder was a little different.
0545265355|5.0|I received the 3 book set in 2 days and in great condition. I would recommend this series of books to anyone who enjoys reading.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|Crashed my kindles wifi I wouldn't recommend it to someone. Great concept but never got to play the game. But if it worked for u have fun.
B00000J7J7|2.0|I really enjoyed \\"Love Songs\\" by Anne Sofie Von Otter and Mehldau, so bought this cd hoping it would be equally likeable.  I have been sorely disappointed.  Something about it is rather like scraping your nails down a blackboard.  It grates. There are a few tuneful moments, but they are fleeting.  Overall it tends to sound rather dissonant and off tune.  I realise that is largely to do with my lack of appreciation of this form of jazz.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to the casual jazz fan.  It's for advanced aficionados who can \\"get\\" the difficult harmonies.  It's not for beginners.  I would not compare this to Keith Jarrett.  His style is readily accessible to most music lovers.  Mehldau's is not.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I bought it for my little brow nut I played it and it is ok but I rate its four stars cause my little brother loves it
B0052BPPFW|5.0|I love Nicki Minaj's first album Pink Friday. I do like the Deluxe Version of the first album. My favorite songs are in this album is Roman's Revenge (feat. Eminem), Did it on Em, Right Thru Me, Fly (feat. Rihanna), Check it Out (feat. Will.i.am), Moment 4 Life (feat. Drake), Super Bass, Last Chance (feat. Natasha Bedingfield), and Muny. I'm really not a hip hop/rap person, but I love Nicki Minaj. This album is so much fun to listen to.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I tried installing it more than three times now and it still isn't working. it has even told me that I need to download it again and it's just not worth it.
0345529057|5.0|This is a very good value for the set. Much better than if you were to buy them separately and let's face it, if you read one you have to read them all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|First of all, how easy to order and download from Amazon!<br />The book, or the trilogy is very intriguing .....not so much the sex part that everyone is talking about, but just the emotional bond and development of the characters...the author writes so you  feel like these people are real! One of my goofy friends googled Anastasia Steele to see what came up...she claimed she wanted to see who may play her in the \\"so called\\" movie coming out!  Definitely order books, you won't be disappointed
B0088WGBC8|4.0|Very enjoyable! Well worth renting. Not a movie I'd buy on DVD/Bluray but still a good flick. Great ending! Glad to see the \\"bad guy\\" get what he deserves!
B007QNRMUU|5.0|The music is amazing.<br />I really like the fact that I can download it onto my iTune without any trouble. I was worried at first, but nothing happened that required me trying to figure out a solution.<br />Love this system.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun games for free definitely an awesome and must have app for those who like mini games. something for everyone
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Mommy porn? Not! If you're looking for some heat go elsewhere. This book does NOT represent all women's desires. Book sucks!
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins have a much different approach to book-writing than say, for instance, Hitchens. It's a quite dispassionate book with easily grasped facts about (primarily) the Abrahamic good and a great deal of information on how it has become a great delusion to billions.<br /><br />While not as hard-hitting in terms of vivid story-telling language, it's excruciatingly interesting and still very easy to read. Many good arguments from the deluded are put to rest in an objective, patient and evidentially accurate manner.<br /><br />A pure joy to read.<br /><br />If you are unsure on where you stand spiritually, this book can help you find great spirituality within yourself and your fellow man, and it will help you (at the very least) cleanse yourself of some things you might think is less than 100% with your religion(s) of choice. If you are a true believer, I won't say it will change you but in fact it might just make you look harder for yourself to justify your beliefs and perhaps be able to convey the reason for your belief better.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very good game! and its really easy. all u hav to do is swipe... I recommend this game for people who like adventure
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My hope in the world moving forward is that more inspirational and positive movies come out instead of the sad trend toward the lowest common denominator of complete garbage and pushing the crude limits.  This is a great movie to see as a family (the shark attack may scare some).  Since it is based on a true story vs Hollywood's hilarious inspired \\"by true events\\", it gives me faith moving forward in our society!
B008MEM24S|1.0|the app would not load on my kindle fire.  I think I purchased the app a dozen times with no luck.  Frustrated, I hope I don't get charged!
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie - very good acting, clever concept, good story and way under appreciated by the general public.  Give it a shot and you shouldn't be disappointed!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this is a handy tool, love the list feature and the fact that you can tap on items to literally cross them out when you're done.  clean ui, very cool.  I lovd it so far!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I was really worried that the Underworld series was going to take a serious mis-step with the story because I wanted to see them have Selene and Michael take charge of the world.  The good news is the story fits from coming off of the third movie and ended up be really good overall!  I am unsure how they will followup from here, but we will see...
1401233791|4.0|The first part of the book is mesmerizing.  The plot is very well put together and kept me glued to the story.  What kept me from giving it 5 stars is that in the latter half of the book, the plot weakens.  I would give the first half a 5-star rating but the second half a 3-star rating.  The latter half was ok which in comparison to the first half was a bit disappointing.  That's not to say that there weren't exciting scenes, but it is to say that the brilliance and simplicity of the plot from the first half was missing.  I'm not really all that excited to read about Jean-Paul's new character, at least, not until hollywood makes a movie with him him in it in which Part 2 becomes essential background reading for the movie.  But that's a big IF.<br /><br />Still, reading about Bane, Batman's demise, Azrael's ascent, Robin's role and the deviancy of Arkham's inmates made this an overall fun read.  I would like to have seen more deviancy from Arkham's inmates.  The bits and pieces of the Joker and Riddler were built up well but then they suddenly disappeared and never re-appeared.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|I found I Am Number Four to be fun, entertaining, and overall very enjoyable! Everyone in my family thinks there is something wrong with me (what do they know).  Now where is the sequel...
B0018RFLN0|4.0|This is one of the best movies with tom Crews a lot of action just the way we like our movies
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to say Gone Girl was THE best book I've read so far this year!! Totally unpredictable mystery!!! The book kept my emotions for the characters going back and forth. Most of the murder mysteries I've read this year have been good but very predictable...the way Gone Girl is written, you're never sure!!!! I loved that!!!Lots of surprises!!! Would love to see this made into a movie!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me from the beginning. It moved through several twists and turns and had a nice style to it.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Bringing up Baby may be an oldie but it is most definetly a goodie. Cary and Katherine may be the stars but we can not count out George the dog or Baby the leopard. All the action is fast paced and the supporting cast was well picked.I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants a good storyline, lots of crazy action and laughs. This movie is one year older than I am but it is timeless. It belongs in everyones collection. I'm not too good at these reviews but I really think this movie is the best!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Stop reading all the \\"5 star reviews\\"  and start reading this book now! You won't be able to put this book down! It's simply awesome!  Buying Part 6 now and preparing for another \\"all nighter\\"!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun cool game it is really sweet it is hard to get tokens though and the games are really expensive by the third page
B003L77G10|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first season on DVD and was looking forward to seeing how things developed in year 2. Unfortunately, CBS DVD allowed Good Wife Season 2 go to the disk duplication plant with a set of video masters that look like someone had boot-legged them off a low-bandwidth channel of YouTube. And the problem isn't just in one or two episodes. The abysmal video quality ruins your viewing pleasure for all six (count em, six!) disks. Season Two brings great new story lines for Alicia, Kalinda, Will and company yet I find myself constantly distracted by the fuzziness and pixelated image quality. If these flaws weren't baked right into the brand new shrink-wrapped product, I'd have sent it back immediately. What a disappointment!
1612130283|1.0|After 149 pages I threw the book into the trash. Boring. Annoying. I love a sexy book. This one is not.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is soooo cool. i can't stop playing it. it zhould be 1of the most addicting games in the world.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|this is not right i want to beable to play games to.  but i need a us adreess which i think is unfair cause not every one has a credit card
B0086700CM|5.0|very good game still some slight problem but everything else is great. one of my favorites games. temple run brave is no better than the original templerun.
0307716546|5.0|This is a mystery as well as a love story; the love in a marriage, the love of family and the love of a mother for her children.  The story is told by two people who have been traumatically injured in a school fire.  They are talking to one another as they are outside of their bodies. Although that may be too much for some readers, I found it to be an ingenious way to relate the story.<br /><br />There are twists and turns at every level and you won't want to stop reading. But the real story for me, the truly beautiful part of the whole book is Grace Covey's love for her family.  Have kleenex ready;you will need them.  Be prepared to be surprised as well. A gorgeous,imaginative tale that I am still thinking about today.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the becoming ones were easy but they do get harder its a good game to help pass the time give it a try
0439023491|4.0|The book was in great shape when it arrived, and shipping was very prompt.  My favorite part of the book was in the middle, and I wasn't really thrilled with the ending.
B007712XAU|5.0|One of the very best English dramas from recent time - shows the way aristocracy and their workers downstairs co-mingle.  Also educational - depicts the way our own American Biltmore operated.  Lovely music to accompany the a story.  A great buy!
0756405890|5.0|For the few of you not already familiar with THE NAME OF THE WIND, it is the story of Kvothe (pronounced like \\"quothe,\\" as in \\"...the Raven\\"). When the story begins, Kvothe is a man of many legends, a hero several times over. Therefore, the Chronicler has sought him out to record Kvothe's story, directly from the man himself. THE NAME OF THE WIND is the first of a trilogy of books, each representing one day of narration by Kvothe. Book One tells of his youth in a troupe of performers, learning the magic of sympathy. These happy years end in a terrible tragedy that will define the rest of Kvothe's life. He lives as a street urchin for years, living a life of fear, poverty, and violence. And eventually, he makes it to the University, where he can continue his studies of sympathy. You see, Kvothe is a genius-able to pick up just about anything with amazing quickness and understand it on a profound level. A man with that sort of talent is trouble. Eventually Kvothe is expelled from the University at a younger age than many are even allowed in.<br /><br />It may seem like that summary is full of spoilers, but you'd be wrong. Most of that information is found on the back cover. And it is not as if I really had to restrain myself when writing the review of THE NAME OF THE WIND. Quite the opposite. I have only scratched the surface of the book and the writing abilities of Patrick Rothfuss.<br /><br />THE NAME OF THE WIND is an amazingly good book. Patrick Rothfuss writes with a beauty and lyricism that captivated me from the beginning. Kvothe is a fascinating character that readers get to experience as a boy, a teenager, and an old man. It's done so well, readers will barely be able to wait to learn more about the missing parts of Kvothe's life. The magical system of sympathy is so well-defined that readers will understand it on a deep level. And Kvothe's world is more fully realized than many books I've read recently.<br /><br />It is easy to see why his writing has created a legion of fans of Patrick Rothfuss writing. Rothfuss's talent is such that his writing will either drive you mad with jealousy or fire your creative spark, driving you to improve your own writing. I can't recommend it more. So now I'm off to get a copy of THE WISE MAN'S FEAR, and to beg Patrick Rothfuss to finish the third book, just like all his other fans.<br /><br />(review originally posted here: [...])trick Rothfuss writing.

0765316994|4.0|One of the classic Star Trek tropes was that when an away team beamed down to an alien planet, although the officers might get bloodied, the unknown ensign-wearing a red shirt, of course-would die, often horribly. So John Scalzi decided to tell the story of what life would look like from the point of view of those red shirt wearing ensigns. But the resulting novel is more than just a 300-page meta riff on a sci fi cliche. Although there is plenty of sarcasm (this is a John Scalzi book after all), this is also a smart, fun, mix of sci fi and adventure told with a surprising depth of emotion. On top of that, it's also a book about storytelling itself (adding another level of meta fun onto the pile).<br /><br />REDSHIRTS begins with Ensign Andrew Dahl taking up his post in on the Universal Union Capital flagship, the Intrepid (cough, Enterprise, cough). Dahl quickly learns that the crew spends most of its time avoiding away team missions through superstition and ritual. And while that is odd enough, with each week on the Intrepid, Dahl and his fellow redshirts learn that the away teams are but one tiny part about life onboard that does not make a lot of sense. Or is there a method behind the madness?<br /><br />It's not mandatory that you be a Star Trek and sci fi fan to read REDSHIRTS, but it certainly helps. And let's be honest, on the Venn Diagram listing John Scalzi fans and Star Trek/sci fi fans, I would bet that there's a lot of overlap. So I assume most readers will get the Star Trek and sci fi jokes. But more than jokes, there are some well-drawn characters who are having to deal with death, while also questioning reality, fate, and free will.<br /><br />Also, you may have noticed that the full title is \\"REDSHIRTS: A Novel with Three Codas.\\" The three codas less Star Trek and more about wrapping up the story-in increasingly beautiful ways (bonus points for noticing the atypical ways the codas are told). In other words, not only is REDSHIRTS very entertaining, but it has quite a bit of substance as well.<br /><br />As summer kicks off, you'll want to pick up some fun reads. Definitely pick up REDSHIRTS. I think most genre readers will love it.<br /><br />(review originally posted here: [...])substance as well.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is so much fun to draw with your friends! except the update hasn't came out yet! I am waiting for the update!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I cant stop playing this game!<br /><br />I love it.  very relaxing!  calming!  the music is even soothing after a long day at work.
B0000064TT|5.0|Years ago a former prog fan gave me a copy of Industry Standard and I really liked that. Now he gives me pop music but back to the main point. I have always intended on going back and purchasing their material. I got Free Fall in the early 90s but I kind of forgot about them for some time. Shame on me. I finally got this one and boy is it awesome. Someone said in another review- imagine Kansas without vocals and you have a good idea of this band. That's a fairly close assessment of the Dregs. So, if you like Kansas and prog in general, you will like this band.
B007RKPO84|5.0|The new KREATOR is b.a.f as is all their stuff is. I bought the delux version cuz product details said cd/dvd  but when i got it  and went 2 watch tie DVD NOTHIN hAPPENED  cuz it wasnt a live dvd it was a live cd  so if those of u buyin this with hopes of watchin KREATOR live u will only get 2 hear them live .
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is an AWESOME game. I must say that you must be a fast thinker because the ferther you go the faster it goes. me and my little sister love it. it is just like Mario brothers but with a lepercon.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this backpack because I did not think that carrying my laptop to work in a standard laptop shoulder bag was healthy.  I was starting to suspect that it was affecting my posture and adding back pain into my life.<br /><br />After purchasing this on Amazon (but the 1 day it took before receiving it), I realized that my boss actually had the same bag, and she had just received hers within the week.  She was raving about it to me which made me that much more anxious to receive mine.<br /><br />It's very well padded to protect your laptop.  There are countless pockets, and the zipper quality is very good.  They feel like they can be zipped and unzipped countless times without issue.  Many of those pockets appear to be purpose built... for the laptop, sunglasses, umbrella, your phone and/or MP3 players, and to wire through a set of headphones to them through a dedicated pass-through for the wire so that it does not get frayed.<br /><br />I am still trying to identify good purposes for some of the pockets, but I love this backpack, I love the quality, and I think that it's going to last a very long time.
B007HJAJSA|5.0|This series is very true to the books!!  Absolutely amazing!!!  The details are stunning!!!  I'm lovin' it and can't wait for the next series!!!  :)
B004WR125O|3.0|I got myself a refurbished Netgear WNA1100 WiFi adapter for a price that is in the mid single digit. It was recognized immediately and seems to have better range than the Onkyo one. Works just fine. I use this with a TX-NR509.
B000FC12C8|1.0|one of the worst books i ever read made for a investing. The problem is its not written by ben graham its written by some idiot who is trying to explain ben graham. Its so full of balony don't bother reading. unless its ben grahams books don't buy it. They will re write it and make it more complicated to read and it leaves very few lines of information from graham himself. What a rip off. This jason guy is an idiot.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|The Smashing Pumpkins are one of my favorite bands, but it has been a long time since they have really showed me something great. I mean yes I know that Billy Corgan is the braichild of this act, but the sound and the feel of this band is just not the same as it was since 'Machina'. 'Ocenia' is not a bad album, but it just doesn't have the magic that made the Pumpkins what they were back in the years of grunge and alternative. Maybe it is because the music scene has changed that much, maybe its because of the direction Billy Corgan is taking with his artistic talent. Or maybe its just because the origonal band is not there anymore, I don't know.<br /><br />As I said, the album is not bad, in fact it is a good listen, I gave it it's rating because I know where this band has been and they are just far from that status at this point in time.
034580404X|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I loved the characters and their roles in the story. I think these books were the first among a variety of books that I have read that were educational, sexual, hilarious and exciting!!! I hope there will be a sequel, is there? I never thought I would laugh at the use of the F word being used so frequently!!!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Works as stated.  BEWARE...on my macbook pro, I need to support the connector in some way (underneath).  ONLY FOR USE WHEN LAPTOP IS ON FLAT SURFACE.  Between the weight of the FW400 cable and the connector itself, it tends to sag down and can interrupt connection to your device, or damage the FW800 input or adaptor or both.  There's really nothing that can be done about this aside from SONNET making a FW800 to FW400 cable.  My audio interface highly suggested using this brand of adapter, so my options were limited.  To my knowledge, SONNET does not make a cable - only the adapter.  That being said, it's a minor inconvenience, but just slap something underneath there to support it, and call it a day.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was surprised at how well I did. I liked the water sound effects. it made it relaxing. im playing it on kindle fire and it works well. if u have time to kill this will do the trick nicely.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|All the kids love this, they watch it once a week.  Has adventure and music. Must have for parent survival.
030758836X|3.0|I am a very picky reader, and tend to start books and put a lot of them down...I have to stay entertained I guess.<br />The good:  definite page turner, lots of twists and turns,entertaining<br />The bad:  not likable characters(which may be a good), The ending development was weak. There was a lot of time spent through the book to develop this story,and it was as if she didn't know where to go(she had exhausted all of the twists) so she pushed in this weird ending.<br />But, it's a weird book.
B005FITIGO|3.0|All characters acted very well, and script was well written. However, it's unlike most common movies, since it did not actually have any specific story or heroes or heroines. Overall an enjoyable experience, but on the verge of being like a documentary.<br />You will enjoy it if you have slight interest about the life running on numbers in Wall Street.
0553801503|5.0|Thank you so much for sending me this book so quickly! I was very impressed with its good quality, since it is a used book. I expected marking and wear and tear, but it really looks great. I instantly dove in and started reading...this \\"A Feast For Crows\\" is in a series of 'A Song of Ice and Fire' and hard to put down. As soon as I finish one, I am eagerly wanting to start on the next one. Again, thanks for the speedy delivery of a great product!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great when you are totally bored. kids love it too. I'm totally hooked on this game! Definitely worth it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are super easy, some pretty challenging. good for when you are bored and need time to kill or get your mind off of things. I recommend if you have a decent amount of free space
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I downloaded the free version first to see if it was worth purchasing. I was quickly caught up in the game play. I am doubly pleased that my kids, 7yrs &amp; 5yrs, can play it too. Challenging enough for an adult, simply fun for kids!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Although this skipped around a lot it was still good to know what was happening with the characters.<br />If you are searching for action, this is a bit lacking.  I was very surprised at the sexual content.<br />Previously, he wrote interestingly without being so explicit.  Are you sure this was written by<br />the same person?  I am not going to recommend this series to my younger neice who would have enjoyed<br />it otherwise. If the next book in the series is of equal content I believe that will be the last time<br />I purchase any more of his work.
B005F3XV62|4.0|Great movie and product, so far all movies have been as expected, I will continue to order<br />them as they are available.
B005MWPW86|5.0|If you like Craig Ferguson, you will like this book. Both my son and I read it and we both totally enjoyed it. It's a quick easy read that has a terrific ending.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|Delivers very good sound quality.  The headphone is plugged into a new computer using Windows 7.  I use Triad Audio's Lisa III amp to enhance the sound quality.  The only thing that bothered me was the band across the head was digging into my scalp so I wrapped cloth around it to solve it.  It could use more foam padding.
B00843TZJ2|4.0|Comparing the HD Tracks 48/24 PCM to the BR 48/24 DTS HD MA on the same player (Oppo BDP-95).<br /><br />Oddly the HD tracks is much louder, but it's also MUCH more musical. I would recommend the hd tracks edition for those who's primary concern is the 2.0 audio.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I knew it was a sexually oriented book, was prepared for that and looking forward to it. But I was very disappointed with the level of kinkiness described in the book. It didn't have to go that far to be interesting. Bottom line, didn't like it and do not recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I continue to enjoy this app very much. The app is ever more challenging the better one becomes. The different modes are appreciated so not to let the game become a bore.
B008MEM24S|3.0|it's ok but they copied where's my water bigtime!<br />the person who said I don't know what people are talking about is probly nuts
B00785P2QC|4.0|so far so good. plays well on the kindle fire.  loads fast, lots of quests.  good way to kill some time.
0345803485|5.0|My sister encouraged mer to read this as it was one they were concidering for thier book club. I was curious as there seemed some question of it as maybe over the top, possably not quite right. When I started to read the book I was captured by the couples feelings for each other and their differences that seemed so insurmountable. I found myself talking to Ana'don't do it!!' and she always seemed to say the right things and I was proud of her. After I realized the terrible ghosts that haunted Christian I was with Ana and had to get the 2ond and 3rd books also. I loved them all and will read them again. I felt the author must have some great understanding to have covered all the bases so well. I found the outcome perfect. there is a lot of drama and of course an enemy to overcome that had me terrified. I was reluctant because of the BDSM but I am glad I found my way past that. It is difficult to write in first person but she does it well. I have few authors I respect as to their ability to take you into their story E.L. James is one of those and I look forward to her next trillogy!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|I live the color choices. It works great and is very user friendly. Would like it more if it had a purple color choice.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I downloaded this book to see what all the fuss was about. It is totally depressing; poorly written and with a very limited and unpleasant use of vocabulary. The male character is a controlling bully who coerces and grooms his victim into a series of activities for his benefit alone. Its reported 'popularity' is a depressing reflection on how little progress has been actually made for women to be afforded equality and respect from men. It is even more depressing that wealth and good looks are promoted as a means to ameliorate poor (and even criminal) behaviour. What a sad reflection of our times.
0316017930|4.0|This book confirmed A Lot. Gladwell Teaches:<br /><br />No one accomplishes anything on their own.<br />Environments are important to our well being.<br />Societies are set up for some to succeed and other to be used as fuel.<br />And More...
B005LFQRTC|4.0|I was only in grade school when this series enjoyed its peak in the mid-70s, so my memories were still patchy.  However, I was instantly a fan in those days, as were most of my schoolmates.  We used to argue in the playground over who got to be Steve Austin that particular day, and one boy used to sign his papers using the fictional name!  While some of us might distance themselves from Six Mil (shorthand used by the creators) because it is so dated, I am glad to say this is not the case for me.  Despite some early continuity problems with the three pilot films, the series quickly established the complex (for 70s TV) relationship between Steve Austin's instinctive and Richard Anderson analytical characters.  Lee Majors has been criticized somewhat unfairly for his understated performance as the hero, but I believe he brought sympathy and humanity to the series.  Given the later seasons' mystical or sci-fi themes, this one has the most realism, and except for one or two weak stories, most consistent plotting.  I see this show as paving the way for later series such as MacGyver, which I also enjoyed as a teen.
B008MEM24S|5.0|So, I have to admit, I'm kinda addicted to this game. The graphics are great, puzzles are good, and how can you NOT like Agent P?
B001U887N8|4.0|My husband loves the lined crocs.  His feet prespire in any shoe if he doesn't wear socks.  The crocs lining keep his feet cool and dry without socks.  Perfect for around the house.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I love the fact that I can purchase used DVD's, especially for this series as they are priced a little to high for me new! Can't wait to get Season 3!
006197806X|5.0|Pandemonium did not disappoint in any way, and I am so glad about that. The whole time, I found myself still wishing that Alex was alive by some miracle. Even when you can start to see Lena beginning to fall in love again, it still feels wrong because you know that she is still crazy in love with Alex. And every time she mentions that she thinks she catches a glimpse of him, I want her to be able to turn her head and see him there next to her. Their romance was one of the best I've ever read in a YA novel, or in any novel for that matter, and I was so distraught at the end of Delirium when he's just left for dead. And when everything seems to confirm his death in so many ways.<br /><br />I apologize for any spoilers, and I'll try my best not to give too much away.<br /><br />Then, Lena becomes Alex in a way. Just like Alex rescued her from the dystopian society she believed in, Lena rescues Julien from the same society. She is the Invalid that makes her way into his life, destroying all of his previous ideals and beliefs. She's the one who causes him to see that love is actually not as bad as it sounds. That love can do all kinds of good that the DFA wants everyone to ignore. And in the midst of all the heartbreak, hatred and apathy, Lena still manages to find love in places she didn't even know she could. She begins to love Raven, and Julien (of course), and all of the others at the homestead.<br /><br />And then, finally, as soon as you think she might be getting over the heartbreak of losing her mother and Alex and Hana, and everyone else she's lost, Lauren Oliver comes up and slaps her (and you) in the face. And then, because once isn't enough, she does it again! And then a third time. And it's fantastic. I honestly don't know how Oliver created such a strong character in Lena, because if I were Lena I would just quit life.<br /><br />I also really love that the book goes between \\"then\\" and \\"now.\\" It gives a great picture of how much Lena grew during her time in the Wilds, and how she now uses her past experiences to get through difficult circumstances. Because living and surviving in the Wilds wasn't enough. She has to be kidnapped by a group of crazy people who shouldn't be organized enough to even pull off a kidnapping. And then made to rescue some kid she can't even stand at first, who represents everything she fights against.<br /><br />I could honestly go on about this book for forever, but you should really just go pick it up and read it yourself.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I play it everday. I think that it is great for all ages. It is very addictive.
0345803507|5.0|All 3 of the Fifty Shades series arrived easily within the time stated and in good shape. All 3 books are an easy read and are as raunchy as they are reported to be.  For anyone who likes this type of read I highly recommend getting in line to get theirs today.
1451608659|5.0|I have to give this a FIVE! I cannot believe what young Dominique went through with the Karolyis! And I, along with other TV viewers, thought Bela and Marta were great supporters of Dominique with there little acting when the cameras were on them. Shame on the Karolyis! My family had already been discussing how unfair the USA gymnastics program is since one can only move on with Marta's approval. REALLY??? Come on. These two need to be replaced in the USA gymnastics system. Enough of that. Watching from the sidelines during the Olympic Gymnastics of 1996, I believed that Dominique was a happy, well-rounded child.  Dominique lived through quite a few unhappy moments.  I am truly happy that Dominique's life turned out as well as it has. Keep on smiling, Dominique!!!!
B001AQMBNC|5.0|The Blue Ray DVD of Starman is in good Quality. It's a must see movie. One of Jeff Bridges excellent movies he was in. It's not only touching but shows how the world is when they come upon something different they cannot explain.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|well what can I say but; AWESOME!! I LOVE IT!!!<br />I play Draw Something Free quite a bit,  as long as the other people who I play it with,Plays too. Otherwise I Have to wait!! That stinks.TRY IT!!!!!!!  daisygator2

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book in one day.  It draws you in and doesn't let you go!! I laughed, I cried, I was inspired.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I purchased this a few weeks ago when it was the FAATD.  I really enjoyed it and flew thru the first bunch.  Then. I brought my kindle on a family vacation and co tinued to play it...it didn't take long for my 5 yr old and 8 yr old nieces and nephew to see it and take over!  They loved it and their parents even did a few games too.  Its addictive...lots of fun and has wasted a lot of my time.  But its summer ..so its all<br />good.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its lots of fun the only thing annoying is the points you have to wait but its worth it.. I would reccomend it for all people
B008MEM24S|3.0|I just bought thus and I love the game but it keeps going to a blank page and I have to start over and send it to the cloud.
B0080XN3C6|5.0|I looked up kimbra after hearing her voice on the somebody that i use to know track. The moment i heard settle down i was in love. My suggestion to you is download the whole album and listen to all the songs.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Works great with my D5100. I opted for a wired release cord rather than wireless as I am using it for studio work where I am behind the camera and I don't need to be in far from it.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Product was delivered on time, well packaged and as described. Each DVD has the original film as well a \\"Director's Cut\\". Lots of extra scenes, etc.. The DVD case is awesome. Great deal if your a fan of the \\"Alien\\" series!
B004V5QWU2|1.0|If u need a great sleep app try 'Relax melodies'white noise app. Not only is the sound far better- butcher you can pick more than 3 combos AND you can save multiple. favorite combos. It has ocean -storm -ac-music-zen etc tons of great selections without the awful loop dropout sounds. The only lack if u can call it that is no screensaver but your eyes will be closed in sleep so fast it wont matter Save your money on this one and get a lot more sleepy time with the other app. I have to use fans year round for the white noise effect and it even has that! Check it out first. You will be glad you did. This one was awful.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Marware Vibe Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire. This is a great cover, you can take it off with ease if you wish. Helps to protect the Kindle Fire if you accidentally drops and from scratching. Glad that I purchase this case.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have to use box fans 24/7 to get any sleep and never believed an app would help me at all. Tried other ape with scrappy sound loop dropouts and other faults but this one really Is premium! Clear sounds with many choices and the ability to save favorite combos and even adjust sound levels of each sound independent of each other to your preference. I love it and bet you will too. Thanks Ipnos.
0545101417|5.0|I got this book after reading the Hunger Games and was glad it continued the action only a short time after it left off. Book one was good and this one kicks up the danger to another level.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writer of this trash should go back to highschool, which is where that style, if you can call it that, fits in.  It is redundant - sickeningly so - in the first 5 chapters to the point that she even uses the same descriptive word in adjacent sentences.<br /><br />If I had know the book was this poorly written I would have never purchased it.  It was recommended to me by two people and I have since asked them WHY?  They said just keep reading.  I am in chapter 9 and see no reason to continue with this trash.<br /><br />This book should be included in the XXXXX rated section of any book store.  I found it filty and disgusting.  I am no prude, believe me, but books like this are what I consider \\"cheap trash\\".  I think this book is probably the worst one I have ever read regarding writing style and subject matter.<br /><br />If the other two books in this trilogy are similarly awful I am wondering about the taste of my two friends who recommended this book.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I loved this toy so much even though I bought it as a gift, I didn't really want to give it away. So I bought a second one for myself. :) Now I take it where ever I go and use it when doors are locked. ;) You should definitely get this item if you want to be a cool kid.
B008CP93S0|5.0|Excellent movie to watch! Great cast. Just a fun loving film. Would watch this film again if I needed cheering up! [[ASIN:B008CP93S0 Wanderlust]]
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great book. It is just the worst of the three. Being worse than Hunger Games or Catching Fire is okay, because they are amazing books. Mockingjay is still an awesome story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades of Grey is such a captivating novel. However the sex scenes were perhaps a little redundant but exciting at the same time. This book makes one think about what someone else may be going through in thier own lives. I truely fell in love with the characters as they made me mad, laugh, cry, hold my breath and didn't want the book to end. I hope E L James continues to write.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games book was a very exciting read with a ton of great action sequences. Would definitely recommend reading this awesome book.
B000008QMN|5.0|I really recommend this album due to its case art. It's just awesome. Of Course Pink Floyd's music is excellent, but in this case the art of the album is what makes it more special.
630587493X|5.0|For being a somewhat long movie, this is still one of my favorite stories of a cybernetic being longing for love and to be a human so that he can become capable of emotion and other human tendencies and situations.
0756405890|1.0|After 302 pages I am about to give up and find something more interesting. To say that this is derivative is putting it mildly. Clearly the author has read lots of fantasy novels and has been overly impressed by the Harry Potter books. Unfortunately he is not as good of a writer as J. K. Rowley. The quote from the Onion on the back cover of my book implies that this book might be better than Lord of the Rings. I can only imagine that whoever wrote that has never read LoR. The book is disjointed. The first chapter is engaging. The beginning of the story (with Troupers) is interesting and raises expectations. The street Urchin part seems very offkey. Given the mastery of magic this kid has made, why is he reduced to ordinary begging and hiding from bullies? The \\"Magic Academy\\" part is both derivative and predictable. Mean rich kids. Pompous professors who are bullies in robes. etc etc. I really cannot recommend this. Heading off to Dark Carnival later on to find some intelligent recommendations for a good read.
B000SGSU58|5.0|love all his books  my husband and I have read about 11 or 12  of them.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat right till the end.  keep writing michael
B0055SWM08|5.0|Straight forward fun.  Challenging, but not impossible. You can be as obsessive as you want, or just solve the problems anyway you can.  I love this game!
0312427646|5.0|\\"An Uncommon Reader\\" has it all- exquisite writing, marvelous wit, superb construction, acute characterizations and a flawless ending. Pure delight. Order it NOW.
B007SGM084|2.0|Are a few descriptive words that come to mind. On the other hand, the plot line and writing is so simplistic you can follow it while half comatose lying on the beach after drinking 5 mojitos.  Not bad for a hot summer read.
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer is finally back with something new!  I love how he changes it up with every album.  The music has a lot of acoustic guitar.  There are some fun tunes and some soulful stuff.  Great addition to my John Mayer collection.
B00486070K|5.0|1) If you have a macbook air, you really do need this when you back up (unless you have some magically reliable and fast wireless) and cheapoes did not work for me. 2) I ordered this on Saturday night with amazon prime. It arrived Monday morning. Amazing! Thanks amazon.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I'm so addicted to it. Honestly I think it may be better than WoW in some ways! LOVE IT!!!
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Great movies got all 4 movies in one. How cool is that. Got it for a christmas gift. They like it very much we had a lot of fun watch them. Great movie pack of 4 movies.
B0084BM7GW|5.0|The DVD \\"A Diamond in the Mind \\" is not only a great representation of the experience of being a part of a Duran Duran live show, it is also visually stunning to watch. If you love great music & want to be entertained, than this DVD is for you!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|with all the zombies. its fun to cut there heads off. but I really like having allies. but the poliont is just be a samurai
B0059XTV4Y|2.0|Just rented this.. I have to say it is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. The love story itself would have been great, it is a beautiful story in real life but.... it got lost in a mess... I'm still not sure what the point of the second plot line was or why it was relevant to the story... I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it and another 5 minutes writing this review. To end on a positive note, the costumes and stylization of the movie was beautiful.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This movie blew my mind. It was well made, well scripted, and the twist at the end made me fall in love. Chistopher nolan's directing ability along with hugh jackman and christian bales acting ability and not to mention the incredible storyline/script all come together to form a masterpiece! Fair warning though, your brain will hurt!
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|After an album that all but screamed \\"experimenting with our new found maturity,\\" Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington have taken Linkin Park back to the basics. Lots of rap-rock hybridization, short blasts of industrialized guitar fuzz, and co-producer Rick Rubin's less is more zen-philosophy of record making. I do mean less; \\"Living Things\\" clocks in under 40 minutes without an ounce of filler. But that makes me something of a dissenter here, as I really enjoyed \\"A Thousand Suns\\" and the wild experimentation that went on with the album's suites and social commentary.<br /><br />That makes \\"Living Things\\" a good, if basic, Linkin Park album. There's not much you haven't heard them do before, with two exceptions. First is \\"Castle of Glass,\\" an almost folkish number that lets Mike sing without screeching. He proves he can carry a melody for a whole song without going to cookie monster vocals, and does a good job on \\"Roads Untravelled.\\" Then there's the slab of noise that is \\"Lies Greed Misery,\\" which comes close to being a dance-rock track and plays with the vocal track a fair amount. If you're looking for what you've expected from LP, that's here too. \\"Burn It Down\\" could be from any point in LP's timeline, and showcases what the group has always been best at; fist pumping anthems that blend hard rocking with electronic muscle.<br /><br />The remainder is a mixed bag. Nothing here wallows in the sewer, nor does it rise to the level of \\"Meteora.\\" However, when they sing on \\"Burn It Down\\" 'we're building it all to break it back down,' then maybe \\"Living Things\\" is the transitional album I thought \\"A Thousand Suns\\" was meant to be. Either way, it's a middling album from a band that I count as one of my guilty pleasures.
B008645YEE|5.0|Hans once again shows why he's one of the best today.  That last piece is simply breath taking and so well done.  Highly recommend.
0307593525|5.0|This book is a must. If you love cooking you will find recipes easy to cook and delicious. Its original version was from 1961 but it has remained a great text. It's like an encyclopedia of french cooking, it guides you through different cuts, seasoning and preparations so you actualy learn to cook different dishes. I tried the Coq Au Vin and it was wonderful! So far my favourite dish!<br />As it comes with the second part (1970) you'll have the whole collection for a great price!<br />I live in South America (Chile) and i had trouble getting it, but Amazon's Customer Services was AMAZING! They took care of all troubles fast and efficiently!<br />So... Go for it!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have had issues with insomnia for as long as I can remember. This is fantastic to listen to when trying to wind down and relax. I love the varieties of noises and songs. Since I got this app I've slept great and bathtime is way more soothing. I reccomend this to everyone I know since there is something for everyone
B006LSZECO|5.0|Haven't read a book this great in a while.  Def. going to order the rest of her books.  Lots of twists and great writing.
B0048EK40K|4.0|An odd book. It is wrtten in clear prose, I like the style. There are no over literary wanderings. Vonnegut peoples his book with rather oddball characters and weaves an equally odd story. Rudy's parents are born rich and qualified for nothing in life. They feel like the Russian nobility, playing in their fiefdom while the world crumbles around them. Rudy shoots a pregnant woman accidentally at age 12 and his father nobly takes the blame - quite unnecessarily and to the destruction of Rudy's life. The chapters are interspersed somewhat bizzarely by recipes. I enjoyed this while at the same time being somewhat bemused. You can probably read this on two levels - as a simple, rather unique novel or as a deeper commentary on life and society. Vonnegut finishes the threads of characters he has carried from previous novels in one fell swoop. It is a bit like a soap opera where the actors have caused a bit of trouble with contracts so you have a big disaster and wipe them all out. In the end Midland city is so unimportant that it is pretty much instantly forgotten and the military get to do what they like with it.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I know is a pdf reader but it could be better if they add epud reading ...everything else is good
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I love these films, yes even the infamous Alien Resurrection, and was glad to have a box set on Bluray.  There are multiple cuts to choose from (per film) as well as introductions by the directors.  Excellent sound and picture quality, worth every penny.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|While I did not see this movie in the theater, I knew that I would see it as my youngest daughter is obsessed with monkeys. I have seen other Disney Nature films and have continually been impressed with the quality of the film but also the quality of the story as the director and all others involved always do such a great job at telling the overall story itself that you are drawn in and do not want to leave until the movie is over. They have done it again in this film as you see the amazing tale of Oscar. This was a heart-warming tale that you will not want to miss, and not only is it entertaining, but it is educational as well. Tim Allen does a great job at narrating the story, and you will be amazed that the Disney Nature crew were able to capture the amazing journey of this chimpanzee, I know that I was!
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik \\"Chava\\": This is my favorite movie, hands down. Whomever gave it less than 4 stars doesn't understand superb direction, casting, acting and screenwriting.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I still remember when this movie came out in the theater and when I saw it I could not stop laughing. Since then, I have seen this movie so many times and each time, though the humor is a bit corny at times, I still find myself having a great time. If you have never seen this movie, you need to, to experience some great acting as well as the amazing wit and humor of Mel Brooks. This 25th anniversary edition is the perfect way to experience the movie as they have brought the best of the movie out in Blu-ray format and have provided some great bonus features that I have not seen before! You will enjoy hours of fun for the whole family in watching this and you too will find yourself laughing your hearts out!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I always sleep well and long after i use this at night. There is a wide variety of noises that you can put together and they're all very relaxing. The app doesn't close after the timer runs out, even if you check the box, but oh well! It's not wasting any battery.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is a lot like other pay to play memos, except for two things: the npcs are better, and its cheap enough for pretty much anybody to play. If you spend $20 on time, you get 2 1/2 years, but on a normal mmo, you get one month. This is highly worth the money, unless you don't like rpgs, of course.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|amazing&#60;3 i absolutely love the movie. im excited to read the book even though its a tear jerker. its imtemsely sad. i cried durimg the movie!!
0525478817|5.0|I don't know that I can contribute any more here that has not already been written.  This is a wonderful book.  I absolutely fell in love with the main character. Throughout I found the writing simply excellent.  This is probably the best book I have read all year.  I really look for more from John Green.
044024630X|4.0|While not the best Jack Reacher tale, this is still a good read.  This book had less beating on bad guys than most.  I would have preferred more of that.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is the best app ever. Plug in to a speaker or device and man you talk about the best sleep u ever had.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|great office product for android. only issue with it is that it hasn't been updated to work with the new google drive. used to work great with google docs.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|excellent way to pass the time.  it's not too tough, but there are some challenging puzzles.  more words to meet the requirements.
B005CCT37M|4.0|Official guides are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. The fact that they are created by the test makers instantly guarantees their acceptability among the aspirant community.<br /><br />The explanations provided at the end are really good and for any beginner, buying an official guide is better than buying 10 other guides from sources other than GMAC.<br /><br />The questions in this guide are suitable for all levels, and students can work their way through the levels thus building skills along the way.<br /><br />Most students( if not all) strive for that elusive 700+ score and it is common knowledge that the gradient varies more for verbal than for quant. You can check out scale conversion matrices to verify the claim.<br /><br />The greatest strength of this guide is, for reasons stated above, its greatest flaw.<br />What you get in the form of practice problems are totally different from the monster that you face once you get your performance going during the actual test. A collection of questions of increasing difficulty is different from a barrage of 99%ile questions and that also in an unpredictable order.<br /><br />There are several ways to counter what I have just stated, and I guess the book serves its purpose, otherwise it must have had a name like 'Toppers guide to Verbal'.<br /><br />The message is clear. If you are looking for a book to help you brush up your basics, this is the book for you.<br />If you are already in the region of 40, and looking to increase your score by 5 - 8 points, this book will not help you.
B005LAII0S|2.0|I was expecting to have fun watching this, but instead... I found myself actually a bit irritated and put off. Definitely not my cup of tea as far as fanciful comedy, or however you want to catagorize this. Very disappointed.
B00280LYIM|5.0|If any of you read my previous review on the third book of the \\"Percy Jackson\\" series, I said that the book felt as if it was swelling it up, it was some sort of hoisting up the battle to a different level and letting us prepare for something big, something very ugly and dangerous for our heroes, and my guess was so true.<br /><br />The \\"Labyrinth\\" in our commonly told Greece mythology, Minos trapped his own monster son into an ingeniously built maze made by Daedalus, and later, a hero came and killed the beast, using a magical string to guide him through. Daedalus was a very smart men, legends has it that he escaped his own dungeon by making a wing out of feathers and wax, but his son flew too high, and crashed in to the ground. Rick Riodan did a brilliant job at adapting the whole \\"demigod\\" thing with this particular tale like he has done with Atlas, the titan whom bears the weight of the sky (in the book three).<br /><br />Nico di Angelo is back, and he is greatly better trained in the shadow magic. For being the son of Hades, he is more than ever as more willing to raise her sister back from the dead, as a soul for a soul exchange. Percy panics at the thought of Nico coming for him as for revenge, but he has more things to worry about. The camp has always been in a dangerous situation, but not as this: the titan's army is going straight for the camp and they are going to use the Labyrinth for its magical exit located in the Zeus's thumb: located right inside the camp's defensive lines<br /><br />The story is exciting, old friends are back for more actions, there are more legends to be told, and Chronos has risen. There was and will be even more dangerous action for our heroes and I am SO looking out for it. RECOMMENDED for U!
0345803485|1.0|Boring and cliché ! Really not what I expected ! Completely overrated, I don't understand why we talk about this book. The plot is so lame and lacking of surprises.... And for the sex part, super poor....
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a easy to learn game that is very fast moving.  the graphics are decent and it plays well on my 7 inch acer a100.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like how you don't necessarily know from one puzzle to the next whether it's direct routes between dots or not. Much more 'thinking outside the box' than I expected. One of the few games I think I'll actually buy. A fun but not overly frustrating challenge.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is big bold and easy to use.I use it to add all my bills.Anyone can use this app even a child.
1401233791|5.0|Knightfall's chapter, Knightquest is definitely the best part of the whole story arc because it gives a whole different perspective on a different man wearing the cowl and cape of the Batman. Because of the fact that our hero Bruce Wayne is out of commission. Now that he is out of the picture, the protagonist is Jean Paul Valley formerly known as Azrael. Jean Paul is now the lead in his own series Shadow of the Bat, Batman, Detective comics, Catwoman, and Robin. We follow our Anti-Hero in this long running series as he tries to live up to the expectations of the previous Batman; as well as his encounters with enemies Bruce Wayne has fought in the past. Finally His Rise into becoming hero to the people of Gotham and his fall into madness as he becomes a vicious enforcer on a crusade to ruin. Knightquest is a must read for people getting into comic books and comic book veterans who have never read this series before.
B00005JNQS|1.0|Is any one else over celebrities lending their voices to predictable animated films with political messages they try to ram down viewer's throats?  Major eye roll.  And the bad guy's evil mother has tied her husband up and chained him to the ceiling? Throw in some potty jokes and this film is a hypocritical heap of doo doo.  Kids were bored in 10 minutes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've been using this app to great effect for my research into battery life and how to extend it with solar power. this apps resources were beyond useful in determining what effect solar power had down to the Milli amp.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It's based on the 1912 book, Princess of Mars.  My partner thought it was terribly cliche - but that's because other movies, from Star Wars, Avatar to Prince of Persia, borrowed freely from it.  This is the original sci-fi swashbuckling fantasy adventure.  I liked it even more the second time I watched it, with the subtitles on, so that I could catch all the dialogue and names.  The green Tharks are smoothly done.  The overall feel of the sets is authentic - not too glossy, and very similar to the original Star Wars trilogy, actually.  I liked the desert cultures, the multi-legged animals, the red Martian's clothing, and the dog-like creature.  I liked the Princess of Mars the most - she's a strong fighter AND a scientist! Taylor Kitsch was the weak point (very bad facial hair and hairstyle) but once I ignored that the movie improved greatly.  I'm going to start reading the books now.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Being a Rolling Stones and Blues fanatic, all I can say is that it doesn't get any better. It's apparent that Mick sat on this being the astute business man. It is both inmitimate and inspiring if you are a blues fan. The production is excellent, the setting is up close and personal. This is a must have for any serious Blues fans, nuff said...

B000BJS4F8|3.0|I'm a huge Alanis Fan, I own and love all of her studio albums. I already owned \\"Alanis:The Collection\\"(standard CD) and I love that audio CD and highly recommend you buy this album! Now to this release, \\"Alanis: The Collection- CD/DVD special edition\\", I purchased this item for the DVD (the CD is identical to the std edt CD) and this is where the HUGE disappointment set in. Partly it's my fault because I did not read peoples reviews that explained the nature of the DVD release- I just assumed her Greatest Hits CD would be joined by a DVD of her music videos, and this is not the case. The DVD doesn't contain one official music video- there is one music video for \\"Ironic\\" but it is a new version that doesn't even feature Alanis in it, rather a little girl 'recreates' the iconic video-Why?!? Further, this release has a misleading sticker claiming that the DVD has an hour long documentary- the doco is just a little over 47 mins long and is something you would only watch once or twice. The sticker and items back also boasts the DVD contains Live Performances, this got me excited, until I learned it features only 3 live performances and the songs were rare lacklustre songs and not one of her many delightful hits! The DVD is a lemon, and a lost opportunity! This release features slightly altered artwork- instead of the standard editions hand against a purple background you get, wait for it, the same hand against a golden yellow background!! In conclusion, save your money, and just buy the terrific standard edition of this title.

B005HERXRC|5.0|This episode revolves around Worf, and explores a few themes. Considering this was only the second season of the show, some of the graphics and action sequences may seem a little dated. However, this is a story-driven episode that reveals much about Worf. Some spoilers follow.<br /><br />For starters, the Enterprise is dispatched on a secret mission (this alone annoys Picard). They pick up an emissary, who is not only half Klingon, and half Human, but also a former lover of Worf's. This emissary and Worf are tasked to work together by Picard. Worf tries to get out of this assignment in an exchange with Picard that is prices (Picard gives a silent stare that says all that Worf needs to know). Michael Dorn's portrayal of Worf clearly exemplifies one of many reasons why this series was so amazing, but also the casting genius that brought this show together.<br /><br />Among the themes explored are social concepts, as evidenced by Worf's strong adherence to Klingon ideals, as well as the Klingon battle cruiser's crew. The idea of falling in love versus having a lover is also explored. But of course, getting to know Worf through this episode was a real delight. I recommend it highly.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read a few reviews before buying the book on my kindle and I found one that said: stop reading the reviews just buy the book, I can't remeber her name. Well...I did it and she was SO write!!!! I can't put in words how much I felt! thanks so much for every word and every moment!xxx
B008IJTFYW|4.0|it 's great for getting to sleep but could use a time out feature when you fall asleep the app plays all night and uses too much battery power. otherwise the many sounds are fun too experiment with!
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is a great book about one of America's true heroes. Eric Blehm not only wrote of Adam Brown's life as a Navy Seal, but wrote about his entire life with all it's highs and lows, good decisions and bad. It represented Adam for who he was; a real person. I thought the book was well written, easy to read, and has a great message for all of us.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Works great especially on my Droid &amp; iPad! I used TWC app and its not as convenient. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for an app that doesnt slow down their phone or drain the battery.

030758836X|4.0|In the sequel to \\"Gone Girl\\", an anonymous tip to the police reveals that Desi was with his mother in Canada on the day that Amy disappeared. What does Amazing Amy do now?  How will she overcome this dilemma?  I think the author would be up to the task and create a fine story line for Amy.  (A hint; in the acknowledgments section the author profusely thanks an obscure Canadian border guard at a remote Canadian entry point.)<br />That would be the logical continuation of the series of improbable events that occurred in the second half of \\"Gone Girl\\". I enjoyed the first half of the book, but for me the second half was not believable.  Obviously, from the other reviews I am in the minority and most readers did not find this a problem.<br />If the story had been set in the western half of Missouri (where Missouri ends in an \\"ah\\" and is close to the land of OZ) I could have disregarded this and been willing to go along for the ride. I grew up in St. Louis and nothing, no nothing like this could happen  within 50 miles of that fair city.<br />I do recommend this book, even with my doubts as to its believability, as the first half is a great read.  One could even say \\"Doesn't that author have a way with words\\".  The author's spouse must lead a very exciting life.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I enoyed the style of writing and empathised totally with each character. Hope to read more by this author soon

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This application fits just right! great audio, dark theme, lots of versions,  cloud sync. well done. reading plans are a great help, too.<br /><br />2/16/2013 update: After using this version for about a year, I have some additional feedback. All the above stands true, so this adds to it.<br />  One very irritating thing about this app is that it is unusually frustrating to use when offline. It is functional, but takes forever to initialize and insists on<br />  showing warnings about being offline. I reduced it to Four Stars because of that.<br />  One thing I do like is the reading plans. There are a number of good ones of all sorts, such as 'through the Bible in a year(or three years)', escaping depression,<br />  etc. You also get daily reminders, as well as the ability to share what you've read.
0312370849|2.0|I found this book tiring to read, because each chapter would swing between 2 different people's lives.  The first chapter was about Sarah, and then the 2nd was about someone else, far in the future....  every other chapter was about Sarah, and after a few chapters, I found that I simply quit reading the chapters about the other character's life in the future, and I simply left those chapters alone, and only read the ones about Sarah.<br /><br />Then, halfway through the book, the chapters about Sarah ended, and the book was then again about this other woman's life in the future.  This woman, who was a journalist, was trying to figure out the story of Sarah by revisiting France where Sarah had lived as a girl.  But the meat of it was about this woman's life, her unwanted pregnancy, her disastrous marriage, her personal problems, NOT about Sarah the victim!  It was boring!  I want to read about Sarah, NOT some other woman's marital troubles year later who really had nothing to even do with Sarah to begin with!<br /><br />This book was tedious to read!  And for the most part, I skpped most of the book, and went straight to the ending chapters, skimmed over them and got the gist of the story in less than 5 minutes.  What a letdown!<br /><br />I do not like a book that alternates people lives in every other chapter in this way.  I ended up throwing the book away after only 2 days!  It was that much of a disappointment to me.<br /><br />And what I've also discovered after reading several books about holocost survivor's stories is that they are all pretty much the same.  Sadly.  It's always the same storyline:  A Jewish family is living in fear...the police come and round them up....they board a cattle train....they are brought to a camp....where their heads are shaved and they live in horrible conditions and starve....they are either gassed or sent to the ovens....or maybe someone escapes.....  BUT they are all pretty much the same.<br /><br />I am finished with my interest in reading books about the holocost.  This book truly ended my curiosity!st in reading books about the holocost.  This book truly ended my curiosity!

B005LAII3U|3.0|\\"Total Recall\\" (2012), a reasonably entertaining but forgettable remake of the 1990 film, seems destined to be compared to the predecessor starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. As to the differences between two versions, I only say that there is much less humor in the new version than in Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic. You will see no Johnny Cab, one of the most memorable taxi drivers in the movie history. What you get instead is a more straightforward sci-fi action directed by Len Wiseman.<br /><br />The plotline itself is basically the same. Colin Farrell is a factory worker Douglas Quaid, living with his beautiful wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale). Fed up with the monotonous life, Doug visits a memory implanting company \\"Rekall,\\" where he discovers a few unsettling secrets about himself.<br /><br />I hate it when a film begins with a long, expository pre-credit text like \\"In the year 2525,\\" especially when it is unconvincing and boring. The 2012 \\"Total Recall\\" opens with such a text explaining that by the end of this century, the only habitable places for humans are the \\"United Federation of Britain\\" and \\"The Colony\\" (today's Australia). The two areas are connected by a massive elevator called \\"The Fall.\\" So, humans can build a gravity elevator traveling through the Earth's core, but cannot cleanse the contaminated soil.<br /><br />Len Wiseman's new \\"Total Recall\\" may look great with the cutting-edge visual effects, but its ideas are badly assorted. The story is dull with a few lapses in logic and Colin Farrell's uninteresting protagonist Douglas Quaid. Villains lack charisma. Each action set-piece is slick, but short on imagination. Hovercars may look real, but the action and the city always remind us of other sci-fi films like \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Minority Report\\" (both based on P. K. Dick stories).<br /><br />\\"Total Recall\\" is a serviceable action film, but is much tamer and less unique than you might want it to be.
0345803485|1.0|Reminds me of the crap I used to read when I was a teenager and even back then didn't really appreciate it. Not worthy of your money or time. The sex scenes are like the contents of a sex guide for starters. Boring...
B008CP93S0|1.0|Ir's bad enough that you'll want your 90 minutes back after watching this waste of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston's talent (assuming you keep watching after the 'mirror scene'), don't make it worse by spending actual money on it. Wait for cable if you must.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Bought this to stock my bug out bag. This flashlight is pretty bad ass. Liked that it took AA batteries. They're cheaper to buy re-chargeable than most others, and I can carry quite a few. It's bright as hell, has many settings and is built with pretty good quality. I believe it'll last for quite awhile. If this isn't the perfect survival flashlight, I'd like to see which one is! Worth every penny!
B00785P2QC|4.0|me and my friend got it at the same time to see who city would be better we liked it i wish it had cars.
0684857219|5.0|What a book! I've had this for about two years now and I've used it extensively. Everything from diet to technique to workout programs. This has it all and more. Inspirational, motivational and exceptional! Worth every penny!
B0071MV540|5.0|Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) is the building manager for an exclusive apartment complex in New York. He is not just a building manager but he is the best building manager who has an almost 6th sense of what is patrons need to be happy. The cheapest condominium in the tower costs $5.25 million so he has a staff trained to spoil the people that live there. The top floor suite is rented by a billionaire, Mr. Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who is a stock market investor. One day the building is raided by the FBI and Mr. Shaw tries to escape but is captured. They want him for stock market fraud and billions are missing.<br /><br />It seems that Josh Kovacs 6th sense didn't work so well when he asked Mr. Shaw to manage the retirement funds of the tower's employees. All of the hard working people of the tower are now faced with starting over and some are near retirement age with their future dreams now lost by the greed of Mr. Shaw. Some of the disgruntled employees plan a heist to rob Mr. Shaw and recoup their lost money before he can get away with swindle....<br /><br />This movie has a wonderful all-star cast that makes it a real good comedy. There are some really good one liner jokes in the script that just cracked me up! My favorite was the maid's retort, \\"You should have tried the cake, man!\\"<br /><br />As you can imagine, everything they plan for the heist goes wrong but they adapt along the way to make this movie fast moving and entertaining. Unfortunately not the entire great cast delivers to their best capabilities but overall it was still a good movie.<br /><br />I recommend it to you to see to have some good laughs!

B008NABUU8|3.0|the controls at times aren't that responsive and at beige 5 my kindle keeps freezing and I have to put it to sleep then wake it to free it.  for two bucks I guess that's what you'd get.  It's said that amazon is coming out with a new kindle so I suggest that you wait till then so you'll have more power to run the app.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I must say I like this and its pretty good, but... When I got it it had a few scratches and dents. There were 2 places that had a chiped off spot. I suggest you buys from somewhere else.
B00005B4GU|5.0|i am a BIG fan of radiohead, so i already knew how wonderful they were. i purchased this album in a used condition because i wanted to be frugal but also just because i needed to get more of radiohead's albums. i put it in one day when i was driving around town, and i was blown away at how relaxing and nice it was to drive to. i use it to calm myself down but also just enjoy the beauty and genius that is radiohead. 5 stars!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This is a great book for runners, and I dare say interesting for non-runners too.  I liked the diversity of Scott's writing and the candour with which he explores his own emotional/intellectual compulsion to run and push himself to the limit.  I appreciated the gentle way in which he explored being increasingly drawn to a whole plant food diet.  I like that he didn't start his book as a \\"vegan zealot\\" and it actually makes for much more compelling reading because the reader goes along the journey that he took.  And how good to have some practical recipes included too!<br /><br />Needless to say the racing side of his achievements are nothing short of phenomenal - a truly inspiring life.
B00846REIS|3.0|I know there's a ton of new books out there that are hoping to ride the \\"Fifty Shades\\" wave.  Some I have really enjoyed such as the \\"Gabriel's Inferno\\" and \\"Honor Student\\" series.  Those books had strong similarities to \\"Fifty Shades\\", but still maintained enough differences to have their own identity.  Then you have books such as \\"Bared to You\\" which are carbon copies of \\"Fifty Shades\\".  In addition to that, I feel like absolutely nothing was resolved at the end of this book, and I saw very little growth in the characters.  Maybe like \\"Fifty Shades\\" more will happen in the second book.  I will give it a chance.  Hopefully this series will redeem itself.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I thought this was both interesting to read and very enlightening. I did not feel like buying Febreze while reading this book or shopping in target. When I had a baby, I remember getting a book of baby coupons in the mail and wondering how target had my address, how they knew enough to send it to me, and I remember having a short discussion with my husband about that. I noticed that there was something off, since the only information I had given them was my debt card when I made a bought something. I knew that marketers were sneaky and good at what they do, but I had no idea it had gotten to be that bad. It's one of the reasons why I do not own a tv and haven't gotten tv reception for almost my entire adult life and why I am now a minsumer.<br /><br />I disagree that everything after the first two chapters where filler. They are necessary for understanding how these habits manifest themselves in peoples lives to get a clearer understanding and to be able to assimilate the information and digest it. It is about more than the destination, but also the journey to get there.<br /><br />I also disagree with those who said the author does not tell you how to create or change a habit. He does tell you how the formula works, but it is something only you can figure out the details. When I was a child all the way into high school I use to bite my nails to the quick. I wanted to stop, but it seemed impossible. Finally, it occurred to me that I bit my nails because A)there was white showing or B)they were uneven or snagged. So I got some pretty nail polish, a nail file, and a pair of nail clippers. I figured if I could not see the white part if it was covered with polish and if I had nail clippers with me to even them out, it would help me. I kept the nail file and clippers on me at all times to keep the nails even. I knew that if I didn't clip or file them, I would start to bite them again. I kept them covered in neat polish always. Eventually, I stopped wanting to bite them.And eventually, I could leave the nail polish off and see the white of my nails and have no desire to bite them. Turns out there were nails to die for under there. Who knew? I had never seen them. It has been a good 15 years since I gave up that bad habit.<br /><br />After reading this book, I have a new perspective on how I stopped. White tips and jagged edges on my nails where my cue, biting my nails was the routine, and having my nails even again with no white showing was my reward. I replaced the nail biting with a habit of keeping my nails neat and trimmed. I still carry nail clippers in my purse where ever I go and have them stashed in various places in the house. Until now, it was actually a bit of a mystery to me as to why this worked. In fact, I thought that I had gotten rid of the habit all together. Now I see that it is still there, but I changed it to a good habit. I can't wait to start applying this data to other areas of my life.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|A decent adaption of Minecraft to Lego. Product was a little smaller than anticipated but for kids - young and old alike - who love Minecraft, this is a decent product! ; )
0062082353|3.0|I'm glad I read this book, but it was not one of the better books in this genre. The book is a very broad overview of the author's life as a navy seal. Meaning, it covers briefly accounts of war and his life. It does not delve deeply into either. The book seemed to be choppy and did not flow as well as it could have. It did give you an idea of the commitment and personal sacrifice these men go through, but the author did not let you feel his emotions too much. He tried at times when getting into his marriage and family life, but each time he started letting down those walls, the bravado resurfaced before he opened up too much.
