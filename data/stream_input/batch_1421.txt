B00526ZKYS|3.0|I heard great things about this book, but im sorry to say i was very disappointed. I couldnt put it down for the first half, but after that it felt like it was dragging. I wasnt a huge fan of Oliver's writing either. It's like she was trying too hard to produce imagery. A lot of it was too cheesy for my taste. While I was dragging to finish it, i couldnt stop thinking \\"Wow, that's cheesy.\\" But i have to say i liked the fresh, original idea. Love is a disease. The basis wasnt something ive read before, so that was 1 of the few ups of this book!
0307592731|1.0|I was looking for a good adventure story about hiking the Pacific Trail.  What I read was an account of a sad personal life was that was constantly referring to her drug addiction.  I wished the sample pages would have given a hint about the real subject matter and I would not have bought this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so cute and fun. you can watch little mini movies of the characters from ice age. and it looks great on the Fire.

0345803485|1.0|I am not a typical reader of erotic books, but I went back and reread the STORY OF O when the press of this book first hit.  It is so superior to GREY that there is really no comparison.  For one thing, the writing in GREY is sophomoric and the character is a young, awkward girl.  I'm in my late 30s and want an older female character to identify with.  I slowly started looking for other erotica novels but well-written ones.  Has anyone read LIFE, LUST & VINTAGE CLOTHING?  I thought it was amazingly well-done (I think it's a pro writer in disguise, but not certain.) It has a terrific love story, steamy scenes that haunt me even in the middle of the day at work!  And then all these amazing colored photos of vintage clothing, since the main character of the story owns a vintage clothing shop.  GREY just got hype, I think, but it's bad writing and too much lip-biting!  But at least it got me back slowly reading erotic novels and I love it.

B007ARJF6G|4.0|I like some things about the way Madonna sings, I heard her sing during the super bowl half time and that promoted me to look at buying this CD.  I was originally going to buy her other version of her CD that had more songs on it, but the songs were too bad, so I bought this (Clean) version with less songs on it and it was a really good price for the music on it.
0765350386|4.0|There are many things that Vin knows, thanks to her brother. She knows that she is no one, that she can trust no one, that no one cares about her and that everyone will betray her in the end. She also knows, however, that she is different from everyone else; she has this...ability. And it may be that ability that has kept her alive this long. And then she meets some people. Or more accurately, then some people come looking for Vin and they will challenge everything that her brother taught her and offer her a chance to be a part of something important. But can she learn to trust them?<br /><br />Mistborn is book one in a trilogy of the same name. Brandon Sanderson takes us to his sci-fi/fantasy world where people are either the low-class skaa or of noble birth. And everyone fears the Lord Ruler, who saved the world and enslaved it in the same act of epic bravery over one thousand years ago.<br /><br />The characters in Mistborn and its plot are refreshingly unique. I enjoyed seeing this genre differently as it was presented by Mr. Sanderson. Some parts were difficult to read, but...they needed to be. I cannot go into more detail without revealing information you should find out on your own when you read, but due to the nature of the story line, some action sequences may leave you dizzy from repetition.<br /><br />This book is so complex I feel like it is a trilogy itself rolled into one book. I cannot imagine how much more ground can be covered in two more books, but I am more than curious enough to find out. Mistborn is well-written and engaging. I look forward to [[ASIN:0765356139 book 2]].
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This lady can really sing.  She has some very, very good songs on this CD.  It's very much worth the money to buy this CD.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Having hiked the AT, I can well appreciate the author's trek and the challenges.  It came off as very real.  Been there, done the walk, much more honest than usual.  I can remember coming to the end--it is both glorious and a real let down as life must begin again.  I also appreciated the struggle of losing her mother as mine died recently and there is lots to work through for daughters when the relationship hasn't always been easy or affirming.  A very good read even though it was difficult to follow in some places.
0307959856|3.0|I really like P.D. James--Adam Dalgleish is my preferred New Scotland Yard detective over Thomas Lynley any day of the week, but Jane Austen is my first love, and so I cannot give this book as high a commendation as I wish that I could. Many of the familiar characters were there, but it was like they really were not (and some of the most comic--Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins were totally absent). The brilliant Elizabeth Bennet was missing; in her place was a flat facsimile of the character who lived and breathed and jumped off the page in Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Darcy seemed to have lost most of his...manliness and all of his sex appeal; instead, James brought in the character of Colonel Fitzwilliam (who, instead of being a likeable and charming gentleman, had turned into a serious and somber, somewhat severe man) to do all the manly types of things, like lead the party into the woods to discover the body.<br /><br />I think the novel that P.D. James wrote was about how an aristocratic family from the early 19th century would react if the murder of an acquaintance occurred on their grounds, NOT how Elizabeth and Darcy would react and handle a murder occurring on their grounds. I believe that if Jane Austen herself wrote a mystery, she would write a light-hearted romp in the style of Northanger Abbey, not in the serious tones of Death Comes to Pemberley, because Austen would never let murder get in the way of her characters, her keen observations of human nature, and her insatiable desire to poke just a little bit of fun at everything. Read it for the faint traces of the characters you love, for a hint of Austen's prose in the narrative, and for the nostalgia of sitting curled up as a girl consuming Jane Austen novels--but don't read it expecting Jane.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I would suggest it to anyone! A good time waster. Worth buying; I got it free as the daily app, but the $0.99 is worth it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing so much about this, I expected wonders; but it is nothing more than Twilight fan fiction and average erotica.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because I had read a few reviews and looked forward to a good trilogy, but I won't be buying the second and third. The subject matter (BDSM) interests me somewhat, purely from an educational perspective, and I have a read a few other novels with this topic over many years. So I was expecting some sex scenes, and don't mind those at all: I have been doing HIV/AIDS intervention work for 20 years, so am not shocked or appalled by any sexual pursuit between consenting adults. But the book was BORING! Beyond the sex scenes on almost every page, there was not much of a story, in my opinion.I continued to look for a deeper meaning in what I was reading, but there was very little discernable meaning. Very disappointing!!!

0062183591|2.0|Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist, has conducted a lot of experiments and has a ton of data available for interpretation. In this book, he saves us the trouble of sifting through his data and does the interpretation himself. This is quite a time-saver, but it would be nice if he had included the data he collected so we might have an idea of how he came to his conclusions. Or, if that isn't practical, he might at least have indicated how many people he tested and a little something about their diversity. As it is, we are left assuming that, like many university-based social scientists, he gets most of his volunteers from the student population. I think that might be relevant, since the tests were mostly to determine levels of honesty or propensity to cheat in some way. Basing conclusions about honesty on a population that is possibly still forming their personal values might not be indicative of the population in general.<br /><br />If you can cast your doubts aside, you will probably find The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty absorbing and thought-provoking. For instance, Ariely finds that the pharmaceutical industry has trained its sales personnel to use psychology to maximize sales, to great effect. Doctors have as little sales-resistance as the rest of us, unfortunately. This is troubling in terms of getting the appropriate care as well as affecting the cost of our care. And his conclusion that we lie more to ourselves than to others is hard to dispute.<br /><br />I found a couple of Ariely's non-data-based examples problematic. In one, he quotes Picasso as having said \\"Good artists borrow, great artists steal.\\" Picasso is not known to have said that, although T.S. Eliot may have said something like it. But more important, Eliot (or Picasso) never intended to imply that great artists (poets, musicians, whatever) steal. The quotation from Eliot is adapted from Shakespeare and is more in the vein of saying that great artists take old ideas and make them their own by applying their unique brand of creativity.<br /><br />Later, Ariely makes a case for how people can be influenced by the behavior of people around them. He says that in medieval times some sufferers of St. Vitus' dance would start convulsing and others would join them, in a form of mass hysteria. I seemed to recall that one cause of such convulsions was eating tainted grain, so I looked it up. I found that ergotism (the grain disease) was one possible cause of muscle spasms, but that historians and doctors now believe the convulsions of St. Vitus' dance were caused by rheumatic fever. Some people do think that mass hysteria was the cause, but there is so much disagreement and doubt, that I think Ariely might have found a better example to make his point.<br /><br />The two examples here are not vital to Ariely's case, but unfortunately, when a reader begins to question the small facts, it follows that they question the larger statements the author is making.applying their unique brand of creativity.<br /><br />Later, Ariely makes a case for how people can be influenced by the behavior of people around them.

B0040JHLM2|5.0|I've been wearing NB shoes (various MR10xx/11xx series) with orthotic inserts for running/walking shoes for many years, but decided to try Brooks after reading very good things about them.  I have mild plantar fasciitis with some pronation, and the shoes were very comfortable even before I replaced the factory soles with my orthotic replacements.  I've now been running & walking with them for over a month and am completely satisfied with them, and will likely stick with them when I need a new pair of running shoes.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|For anyone hoping for the perfect, fairytale ending to the Hunger Games...brace yourself...things are not as pink and fuzzy as most of us would have liked them to be.<br /><br />That being said, I still loved this book! At first I wavered between 4 and 5 stars on this one because it is so different from the first two. Then I realized that it had to be different because after the last Hunger Games and the ensuing rebellion, nothing in Panem could ever be the same again. This book was very raw and real, dealing with the evils of war as well the shellshock and aftermath that people go through when it is over. People's identities change and at times it even becomes hard to tell who the true enemy is...the Capitol or District 13.<br /><br />For most the ending will satisfy, though none of it will be wrapped with a pretty bow. Still, it managed to bring me to tears and touch me deeply. While reading it I remembered fondly those who died, laying down their lives for the future of what they knew Panem should be. I cheered for the survivors and hoped that they could become whole again even after all of the death and sadness.<br /><br />It is this that I love most about the Hunger Games Series...it made me care about these people...it kept me riveted from book 1 to book 3, and though I am sad that this is the final chapter I am happy with the way things turned.

B005L38QK2|5.0|Just picked this up and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />The entire mouse has a nice rubber coating, feels like silicone, very pleasing texture.<br /><br />I have never been able to justify installing mouse drivers but this one has features that make it feel worth it.<br />The software has nice sliders for DPI presets and lighting presets as well as the standard game specific profiles.<br />You can create more than 1 profile for each game which is nice to.<br /><br />The lighting on it looks very nice and there is a \\"Trigger\\" setting that makes the lights pulse on when you click, very cool.<br /><br />The woven cord cover is a nice touch and in my experience adds a lot of durability as well as making it easy to pick out of a tangle of USBs.<br /><br />I was worried about this being a \\"Low Profile\\" mouse but it feels similar to my old Logitech G5, very natural.<br /><br />Like others have said I can see right handed gamers bumping the mice button on the pinky finger side on accident, you should bind them as non essential buttons or disable them until you get a feel for it (by using the driver software).<br /><br />Clicking is satisfying and slightly higher pitch than my old G5.<br /><br />The cord is about a foot shorter than my other mice, this works well for me and prevents desk clutter but if you have your tower on the floor and mouse on the desk you might need to move the tower or pick up an extension USB cable.<br /><br />I played some Skyrim, SC2, BF3 and Torchlight to test it out, worked amazing once I got the DPI set right (again using the driver software).<br /><br />The usb is gold tipped, no improvement there, but it looks nice when not being used.<br /><br />The tribal design is top notch and looks nice with the tractor tire-esq mouse wheel rubber.<br /><br />Steel Series logos on the underside and the USB plug are nice finishing touches, and it comes with 1 sticker with the same logo.  I woulda liked 2 but thats just nit picking.<br /><br />By default it does not have fwr and back mapped to the thumb buttons so you will need to set that up, not hard, just another step before you can use it normally.it does not have fwr and back mapped to the thumb buttons so you will need to set that up, not hard, just another step before you can use it normally.

0316098337|3.0|This book was more of a 3.5 for me, it started out slow, but overall was a very easy read, as soon as I got used to the voice of \\"Jack,\\" a 5 year old narrating the whole story. And really, a 5 year old wouldn't be so bad;my son, now 6, had pretty much mastered adult speech patterns at 5, but Jack, on the other hand, sounds more like a 2 year old, so it was a bit slow going in that aspect.<br /> This story really made my heart ache though, as a mom, and by putting myself in the shoes of Jack.  I just tried to imagine being imprisoned in an almost lightless room roughly the size of my kids room for years on end, all the while trying to protect a son that was born by almost daily rapings by the imprisoner,\\"old nick.\\" Obviously Jack only knows what he knows, so living in this hell is not out of the ordinary for him, and he feels safe and loved. But for his Ma, it is obviously a tortured and depressing life. I loved how his Ma made life as happy as the circumstances would allow, and loved being able to spend every minute with her son. He was really her only friend.<br />I didn't understand her seeming to pull away from him, and her impatience that arose with him after they were out of the Room. I also loved that jack taught a lesson to every parent that reads this, in that he doesn't understand how parents call their children gorgeous, ask them to do cute things so they can take photos of it, but then don't want to play with them. They would prefer to sit and talk with their friends. I think as a parent we can all easily fall into that bad habit.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I look for somewhat \\"clean\\" books, free of sex and language, and aside from a very vague description of old nick coming and squeaking the bed, this book is pretty tame(I guess one of the nice things about a 5 year old narrating is you get that innocence).
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Under the Red Hood is a must see for all Batman fans.  The story is excellent and the art work is also amazing.  Anyone who likes Batman The Animated Series is going to love this movie.  Neil Patrick Harris is especially entertaining as Nightwing.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|There are nearly 1000 reviews of this movie, my comments reflect only the restoration blu-ray version.  I've seen all the GF episodes: theater, VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and now blu-ray, and this disk is the best.  I've also seen a broadcast of GF on HDTV, and the disks are still several notches better.<br /><br />As blu-ray allows, the colors are most striking and vibrant, images sharper than ever.  The audio track is clearest and well separated, and the menu system of the disks are unique and easier to navigate.  Alas, all the extras in this disk aside, what is most vital is having the film in your home in the best possible condition, and this disk exceeds the theatrical release easily, and won't disappoint.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I was so happy to see Quell as the FAOTD.  I was concerned with some of the reviews for the KF. I have not had any problems at all and have finished many stages.

B006ZCWU5K|1.0|I've been a Springsteen fan for years and have many of his albums. I thought \\"Devils and Dust\\" was as fine as his early classics. Most of these songs I think rival his best, but the mix and mastering on this CD is horrible!!<br />At first listen, I had to keep turning it off and then come back to it, because it was too irritating  to listen through from beginning to end. A quieter song like \\"Jack of all Trades\\" survives better than the shouters. Every element of the mix is squashed together.<br />This type of compressed squeeze has been common in hip hop and Gaga style pop for years,and even there it diminishes any quality in the music, but for this kind of folk rock, it's particularly ridiculous. It seems decades of 120db volume in studios and concerts has taken it's toll on the hearing of engineers and musicians alike.<br />Actually this album is a good example of what it must be like to have lost half of one's hearing.

B006H5120E|4.0|What with the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic coming up in a few days, I figured why not go see the 3D re-release of 1997's Titanic.<br /><br />I've long been a fan of both disaster movies and melodramas set in the Gilded Age, so a combination of the two seemed a natural fit for me. Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago? I'm feeling old...), but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film. But you know, I don't think it really deserves it.<br /><br />Oh, there's no doubt the star of the film is the ship; the screenplay itself is less than stellar. It's a bit hokey and clunky and heavy-handed, with no real subtlety or originality. But in one sense, these attributes actually work well with a story set in this era; the simple plot (with a broad portrayal of both good and evil characters) is presented in a fashion similar to how a melodrama would have been depicted back in 1912, whether on-stage or in the earliest short silent films. I found myself thinking that the script really wasn't nearly as bad as many people have made it out to be, over the intervening years since the film was first released.<br /><br />That said, I'm afraid that the film didn't really \\"grab\\" me as much this time around, as it had when I first saw it when I was a good deal younger. Maybe I'm just getting old and tired and cynical? Or, perhaps it's the fact that I'm not a big fan of any of the actors in the film, and have no interest whatsoever in the two playing the leads. I think if the film featured some acting talent about whom I was enthusiastic, who I was excited to see on the screen, I would have found the film to be considerably more riveting. As it is---eh, I'm not all that thrilled with any of the characters apart from Molly Brown, who I thought was a lot of fun in every one of her too-brief scenes.<br /><br />Hmmm, what can I say---I still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission! Sitting still that long is too hard on the butt---heh.<br /><br />The 3D conversion was nicely done, but not exceptional. I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact---after the first hour I kind of forgot that I was even seeing it in 3D. But, no real complaints on this score.<br /><br />This re-release may not set any box-office records, but after only a week in theatres it's already easily paid for the 3D conversion process and is making a tidy profit.<br /><br />---SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING---<br /><br />Oh, I do have one huge complaint---and there's probably no need to even post spoiler warnings, because doesn't everyone already know exactly what happens at the end? While I find the very end of the film most touching---haunting, even---the bit that comes before that annoys the heck out of me. I STILL am ticked off that \\"old Rose\\" threw the priceless blue diamond into the water! I don't care how symbolic it is---explain it any way you like, that was just a stupid and pointless and senseless thing to do to an art object that had huge historical significance. Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem---and then upon her death made sure her will specified that the package was delivered to the Smithsonian, or something like that. Man---even writing out these words, and I find I'm getting ticked off all over again! So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.<br /><br />Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version of [[ASIN:B00008LDO9 Titanic]] (starring Barbara Stanwyck) and [[ASIN:B006ML50SS A Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)]] (also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either...ne that I'm likely to re-watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it. However---any film with a running time of over three hours needs to have an intermission!

So, that's the one thing that I really hate about this film.<br /><br />Well, now that I'm thinking about the ship, I'm curious to view both the 1950's version of [[ASIN:B00008LDO9 Titanic]] (starring Barbara Stanwyck) and [[ASIN:B006ML50SS A Night to Remember (Criterion Collection)]] (also from the 1950's). I've seen both films, but it's been a while and I don't have a clear recollection of either...

B003EYVXV4|4.0|A mega-best selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins has spawned this first installment, The Hunger Games, adapted by Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross for the big screen as a satisfying adventure thriller featuring a terrific performance by budding superstar, Jennifer Lawrence.  The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies.  The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.<br /><br />In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion.  Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or `reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner.  The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment.  There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters.  Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.<br /><br />In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother.  She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her.  When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide.  The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role).  When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.<br /><br />Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.  Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way.  You root for her and feel her pain.  Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see.  Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences?<br /><br />This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite.  If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man.  Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One.  The sacrificial humans are dubbed `tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. \\"War is Peace\\".<br /><br />While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup.  Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement.  I for one am very curious what will happen next.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is one the greatest movie of all times. I was so excited to get this dvd out the mail box. Not only did it arrive on time but inside the original box with the bonus disc. I would highly recommend purchasing this dvd. It was a good price, thank u...
0446547654|5.0|Wonderful story.  Didn't want to put it down.  This is another of Nicholous Sparks novels that should be made into a movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds is, fun and entertaining.  It's like shooting in the dark, but it challenges me to remember where to aim the shots since I can't see the birds and the objects I am trying to knock downat the same time. It's just fun.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is so fun. you can create your own restaurant story. you can also have neighbors over so they can see your restaurant. another thing is that you can also see other players progress.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Found. my new game. Love this game. Getting my area and population huge. I'm always grabbing this every morning to continue my farm.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a really good game. It has easy enough controls, great graphics, and good sound... one of the best games you can get for free.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Burlesque was a wonderful uplifting movie! The soundtrack CD I purchased from Amazon.com was even better than I expected! The combo of Cher and Christina Aquilara is a win win! Amazon.com is the only way to go!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Before I downloaded this on Amazon, I read through the reviews other people had written. I was SHOCKED at some of the comments!! It was very confusing! Some people loved it, and others hated it! So I went to the library first, just to be sure I liked it before I bought it.<br /><br />I have now read and own all 3 in the trilogy, and can not understand for the life of me, why some people are so negative about this book!!!!!<br /><br />It reminds me of the sentiments I've heard about the Twilight Sage, by Stephanie Meyer. Some people hate it, while others are obsessed.<br /><br />I loved this series by E.L. James! I thought they were all very well written, completely absorbing and totally addicting!!!! All I could think about for 3 days was getting home so I could keep reading :)<br />Interestingly enough, the only part I didn't really like to much was the BDSM stuff. Although if definitely added spice!<br />My favorite part, was their relationship in books 2 and 3. Again, it many parts, it reminded me of Bella and Edwards relationship in Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. (Without the sex, of course!)<br />In all honestly, this is the real reason I love these books. Because of their unconditional love for each other, even though its hard! and challenging, and they have so many obstacles to work through. It's a wonderful, panty wetting, love story.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part I is a great teaser for the up coming Part II.  Regardless of what critics say, as a Twilight lover, this is one of the best films of the Twilight saga.  Loved the wedding and cried at the birth of the baby.  Bella a vampire?!  Can't wait for Part II.<br /><br />The quality of the 2-Discs were perfect and arrived very timely.  Just be warned that this edition originally had a replica of the bridal bouquet, but due to the reduction in cost, the flowers were removed by the dealer and sold separately.  I did write to the dealer who explained, but offered a money back guarantee if not satisfied.  However, I was satisfied.  I really only wanted the 2-discs; the popup flowers would have just been gravy,if you know what I mean.  Two thumbs up for Breaking Dawn Part I and the gracious dealer.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Finished this a day ago and wanted to give it a day before writing.<br /><br />This is excellent speculative science fiction, with great twists and character who leap of of the pages at you.<br /><br />Pacing, motivations, and consequences are well thought out.<br /><br />Up until the end I was left guessing whether this would end up an optimistic story of hope, or a sad story of the weaknesses of the human psyche.<br /><br />Enjoy reading this gem of a story.  I will definitely be following Hugh Howey.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love playing this game. objectives are easy and it is fun all the way around. please make it easier to earn bucks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to read this book after hearing all the hype about it.  I read it in about a week and a half.  I just couldn't put it down.  I couldn't wait to start book two, which I am half way through now and loving it too!!!
0670023329|5.0|It is both a tragedy and success story on one man's determination to be FREE.<br /><br />Shin has to battle the demons within him every day and he has the courage and determination to control them,<br />along with sharing his experience with other so we, as the world, can stop this from ever happening again.<br /><br />A must read for anyone that believes in the independent spirit can survive anything including HELL.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun.  Have been playing for 1 day.  I only wish you didn't have to wait so long for energy.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I would never have read the Games of Thrones trilogy if I had not purchased a Kindle. Having the Kindle has enabled me to read the gripping adventures with the vain hope that the books would never end. Absolutely rivetting and an escape from the daily grind.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very challenging and just fun. A few bugs: app goes bonkers then back to norm, quits on occasion but doesn't lose your score or level. Hope it's fixed soon. Good game!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't at all get into hurting people for my own pleasure but even I wanted to slap Ana! I started out really liking this book and anticipating their relationship but halfway through the book I was ready for it to be over. Ana was extremely innocent (unbelievably so) and weak! Just once I would have liked for her to stand up for herself. She would get mad at him for treating her badly and then get scared that he was going to leave her so she'd apologize.  Really made me sick. Also, the sex was not hot. I found myself daydreaming while reading it. If Ana called her vagina \\"there\\" one more time I was going to scream. It was a struggle to finish the book. I won't ruin the ending... But that's my favorite part of the book. I will not be reading the second or third book because this one was such a waste of money!
B005SDMDRW|5.0|I have'nt read this book yet but if it as good as every other book of his I will be very happy with it,I am saving this book for the next time I am travelling

So many lares and then he brings it all together in the end. Perhaps a well read Engish lit major( I know that sounds redundant but it is not: I was a Engish Lit Major and read nothing, truthfully, nothing) could pick this appart....maybe aprouach is formulaic, or what have you....I was A) Impresed and B)very entertianed amd happy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cool game...great graphics. need to speed up energy regeneration. need more space and include built in friends to visit. very nicely crafted game though.
B000002HJA|5.0|This album starts with the cymbal crash from one of Kyuss' hardest songs, Hurricane.<br />I'm not a big enough fan that I know the names of the members of the band, but the drummer is<br /> decently talented, nothing in comparison to the drummer of Rush or Tool, but definitely worthy of being in this desert-style hard rock band from the 90's.<br /> The next song is their hit One-Inch Man. The thing about this song is that the guitar is so crunchy and distorted that I don't even care about understanding the verse lyrics. All that matters is that this song shows off their guitarist Josh Homme who later went on to flourish in Queens of the Stone Age.<br /> Josh Homme also plays a nice riff on the next song Thee Ol' Boozerony, which I often found funny while scrolling through my iTunes library, having never listened to this CD very in depth before. The guitar riffs in this song and the bass line don't match up very well and that and the title of the song lead me to believe that the band must have been drunk when writing this song. Eventually though, they do sync up and lead into a nice outro into the next song.<br /><br /> Gloria Lewis starts out with a rhythmically confusing rhythm (it's actually just slow swing) that is actually in 6/8 as opposed to straight 4/4 rock of the last song. This is in effect just a way to \\"kick back\\" as Kyuss would put it because they were a very laid back band. I won't talk about the lyrics yet, but the vocals actually seem to act as an instrument on this song, contrasting brash vocals with soothing melodic lines, reminiscent of The Beatles, I think, but staying more towards the desert rock feel and 90's grunge bands like Nirvana and Alice in Chains. This is one of my favorite songs on the album, because it shows both sides of what this band can achieve, musically and vocally.  It's really just a tour de force of their more laid back side.<br /><br /> Phototropic is laid-back on steroids. Seriously, this song takes that phrase to the wholenext level. I think this song actually foreshadows the second to last track 'Catamaran.  Phototropic though, has at least 3 complex guitar tracks soloing over an aeolian scale for a couple minutes with a nice soothing bass line. This wasn't typical of kyuss in their early stages. On Welcome to Sky Valley, one of their other albums, their only types of songs were very harshly distorted, or just entirely acoustic guitar with no bass. What they did on this album was combine their heavy side with their relaxed acoustic side, and what came out is gorgeous to say the least. Phototropic and Catamaran are the best two songs to represent their merged hybrid-sound that came about right before they disbanded.<br /><br /> Next four songs all have strange names are perhaps weren't given as much thought as other such as Gloria Lewis and Phototropic, but they are good songs on their own.<br /><br /> El Rodeo picks up where Phototropic started to tire of its repetitive 8 beat rhythmic pattern which eventually just broke down into straight quarter notes.  It begins just in the right ear with an odd whole-tone middle-eastern melody. Then a perfectly counterbalanced bass line comes in and harmonizes along with the drums and a triangle every beat. This is the best way to transition from their almost catatonic-like 'Phototropic' which was very refreshing in its own right. El Rodeo shows off the strange Arabic desert like feel that Kyuss seems to take so much humor and pleasure in and then eventually the lyrics are thrown in as well as an authentic Kyuss riff that seems to go nowhere. The one word that comes to my mind at this point is desperation. The singer just shouts out to someone named Johnny with an overdubbed version of himself saying lyrics which I haven't looked up and can't figure out, but eventually he screamed rodeo.<br /> The song seems like it's going to end after three minutes, but after a few false cadences, it breaks down into a sloppy distorted guitar break down, ultimately prolonging the gap until the next song Jumbo Blimp Jumbo. The singer does come back and sing \\"rodeo\\" repeated ad nauseum, however, but it does sound nice with the guitar in the background finally changing up the riff.<br /> Jumbo Blimp Jumbo starts with a loud insanely wah'd and distorted effect that just defines what Kyuss represented to their fans. The sound was like Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced but merged with so many other styles, that it's ridiculous. Anyone that labels Kyuss as a stupid stoner-rock band obviously has no musical bringing and doesn't understand anything about the guitar.<br />The bass later comes in the left ear and the drums are also in the left ear. The balance is perfect, also reminiscent of the Beatles but this way in the way they mixed albums back then. It seems that such a good process has endured even since the 1920s when Louis Armstrong was known to have  meticulously gone over his trumpet and vocal recordings.<br />The song ends with a very catchy guitar riff from Kyuss that signifies the transition into the last four songs, the first of which benig Tangy Zizzle.<br /> This next song starts out some prank caller saying \\"that's what I like about you baby, you're always on time\\" with an audible muffle as he moves the phone over something and someone's faint voice in the background.<br /> It comes in with a fiercely aggressive guitar riff and very persevering vocals that sound like someone who is about to either do something really stupid or really dangerous. The general mood takes advantage of the augmented 4th which musically creates suspense and coupled with the guitar and bass this suspense is magnified three times. The vocals using lyrics like \\"is it crazy\\" and various obscenities along with his wailings of \\"oh-oh-oh\\" and \\"ah-ah-ah\\" create general unease and an uncomfortable atmosphere which is a definite foreshadowing of the eventual resolve in Catamaran.<br /><br /> It doesn't resolve completely as of, Size Queen, but it's so close you can almost hear the next track before it even comes. The guitar riff slows down slightly and goes back to the swing of Gloria Lewis. The lyrics are smooth and relaxing once again, but the empty space in the left ear tells the listener that there is something more to this song than the first 30 seconds.<br />The unresolved problem of the previous song is solved peice by piece as more parts of the song come into play and change the mix and as more bass lines come into play. It's really a genius act of progression. This band essentially had to summarize a whole career in 3 albums, and one of them was half-assed, so this was their final exam. It managed to be one of the great finale albums such as Abbey Road and The Wall, but it will probably always remain underrated and underbought.<br /><br /> Catamaran is really a song you need to listen to hear, but I can describe it as best as I can. The guitar comes in the left ear first very softly and not very distorted just strumming the bassic chords of the song. Then, the drums pick up steadily and in one to two measure the whole band is there in your headphones. What's strange is there seems to be something missing to the left part of the headphone spectrum. That's quickly replaced by the rest of the percussion set and vocals which are more soothing than ever before in Kyuss' career. There is a harsh bridge that uses heavy wah, the heaviest wah I have ever heard, as the band returns to the soothing intro  with the singer just wailing as there are no lyrics for that riff.<br /><br /> \\"Smooth stones behind me,<br /> Cold air surrounds,<br /> Soft and savory,<br /> I could take you to god.\\" These lyrics are what make up the second verse of this beautiful song which is later sandwiched in between harsh bridge number two which actually ends surprisingly quickly, returning (actually leaving) to the intro/outro riff.<br /><br /> Having such an amazing song usually means that it's the last song of the album, but it's a running joke to put one more song on an album as a bonus track that isn't necessarily supposed to be all that good. Spaceship Landing is that, but it's also not. The song does start off \\"cheesy\\" in a way, but it maintains the drive and struggle of the last songs from the album. It seems like it's trying to get somewhere that Catamaran didn't completely get to. It just uses the same heavy pounding distorted riff that alludes to their simple early sound and close the door on what was an exceptional display of talent in a couple of young kids from Palm Desert, California.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|This is an excellent film! This movie is apparently inspired by True Lies, but was taken to a much higher level, being that THIS couple was made up of TWO Spies who had been doing this for YEARS! It's wonderful how these two Spies have kept up a seemingly 'normal' (albeit 'humdrum') relationship floating along for 9-10 years without the other's awareness. All a part of the concealment of their actual 'Jobs', of course. The sound effects are explosive and keep you seated for the entire ride. The Dolby True-HD 5.1 Surround is everything you'd expect for an action film. The love and affection shared by the Couple is a real Roller-Coaster ride as their pasts/present careers are revealed and interferes more and more with each other's. I can't say much more without spoiling some of the surprises, so.. BUT IT! And do so on Blu-Ray! :-D
0439023483|2.0|So, to be honest, I read this thing in about an hour. I have one of those photomogenic memories.<br /><br />I liked it, the dragons talking to the little girl halfway through the story really confused me, they seemed very out of place.<br /><br />Not once did anyone actually appear to be hungry or in any way in danger. That Peter character needs to man up and kiss Catface on the cheeks or something.<br /><br />I'm no critic, but I'm sure this would make a much better movie than a book. But knowing Hollywoud, they won't get around to making another teen hearthrob movie until Twitlight is over and done with.<br /><br />I give this short story 2 stars because it made me tingly in the stomach area.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Awesome read. The third and last book in the series. the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. Hate that it was his last novel.
B0064Z62R0|5.0|If you liked the movie then you'll love listening to the music at home or in your car. I downloaded MP3 album at a very reasonable price.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this a great app good graphics and solid gameplay havent played the same game twice yet which is good compared to some games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game alot. I would pay for a version without the ads. The cards move nicely and it is very relaxing
B007549W62|5.0|DRAMA, SUSPENSE, ACTION, ..an AMAZING Story-Line with Amazing Actors and a Director who did an Amazing Job!! Amazing attention to detail and Character evolution!! Best movie I've seen in 2-years!!  Brief Plot (because too much to cover to give a thorough Plot description): WHAT IF.... Nuclear Bomb Blasts hit NYC... leaving it like Hiroshima/Chernobyl??  ...WHAT IF... the \\"Lucky Ones\\" died in the blast, and you were trapped in basement of your apartment building, with radiation slowly seeping in?? This movie (was already at the Theater, ..now coming to DVD) is so AMAZING and PROFOUND with all AMAZING Actors doing top-notch performances (including a few \\"big-names\\")!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best series I've read in a long time! Excellent!!! Good principles and action packed to the end.

0307454568|4.0|The book wasn't as good as the first two, but it was decent. Like others have said, the first 350 pages were boring and kind of pointless. I found myself skipping a lot of paragraphs because it had so much unimportant information. The last 200 pages is where the best parts of the book are, I couldn't put the book down! It was a nice closing to the series.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|Do not stand for this.  ULtra Violet is a corporate effort to rip you off.  Demand the real deal! Demand a digital copy.  Now about the movie -  good but not great and that is the problem.  These are brilliant actors and with the right material could have made a film for the ages.  Play it safe is the maxim for holiday movies.  Still, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.
B007JUWM64|5.0|If you go into this movie looking for some deep meaning, perfect adaptation of the book, or oscar worthy performances/writing, you'll hate it.  If you want to simply relax and be entertained? You'll love it, like I did.  I personally wouldn't have cast Lerman as D'Artagnan because, to me, he looks like he's about 12 (I much perfer something closer to Chris O'Donnell's version). The rest of the casting was pretty fabulous!  Orlando Bloom as a villain was hilariously refreshing. Matthew McFadyen has such a great voice, Ray Stevenson is really funny, and I could watch Luke Evans all day long.  I didn't see it in 3D, but I've heard very good things about it! Even in 2D, it was definitely enjoyable. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Mixed some old tricks for a fun new game. Simple interface, nice music. hopefully this works for tablet too. Will try later.
B003UESJDI|4.0|I'll be honest, I really only became interested in watching this film because I think Luke Evans is fantastic.  That being said, I thought the British humor was entertaining, and the two teenage girls were a riot.  I was bummed when *SPOILER* the dog was shot, when really she should've shot his owner.  I was completely satisfied when the cheating writer got his in the end.  The downside to the film (for me) was that, by the end, I really didn't like Tamara enough to want her to end up happy, with the 'nice guy'.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game never bores with so many games to choose from!  ranges from easy games to more challenging games great for all ages!,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a recent Kindle owner, had just finished The Hunger Games series, and was looking for something else that was \\"I can't put this down\\" good.  Wool exceeded my expectations!  If Hollywood is looking for it's next mega-hit, this is it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A Great game, nice music, well thought out puzzles, easy to play but hard enough to be irresistible. Nice job!
B0073PZIYI|3.0|Decent movie - but the whole thing is of course unbelieveable so you have to have an open mind and be able to believe in fantasy, etc.  I would NOT rent this again, but it wasn't a complete waste of money for the one rental.
0440246008|3.0|It grabbed you right away, a key tenant of Lee Child's writing, but mid way through the book it bogs down.  An interesting plot but could have used more editing.
0439023513|2.0|This is most definitely my least favorite of the 3 books in the trilogy.<br /><br />The first 330 pages Draaaaaagged.  On.  Forever.<br /><br />I wanted so badly to just skip to the last chapter to see how it ended.<br /><br />It felt like the author spent way too much time and energy writing about how the Rebels were setting up opportunities to make silly war propaganda videos, and she didn't have any energy left to properly end the series.<br /><br />In most of the key moments, Katniss was not there, so the reader just got a recap of what happened.  For example, towards the end when they are in front of President Snow's building and the parachute bombs go off, she completely misses a raid on the building, so the reader misses out on all those heart-stopping moments too.  Katniss (and the reader) were just given a brief recap of what happened while she was in the hospital or something.<br /><br />This book had at least 2 or 3 big misses like that, which is very disappointing.  I never once felt my heart pound at some major action happening which made no sense because this is the \\"BIG SHOW\\"... the rebellion... everything that we've been working up to, and it was a major let-down.  I almost would have been happier if they just put all the rebels in an arena with President Snow for a fun show-down!  That probably would have been more interesting to read about.<br /><br />The ending for me was also disappointing.  Collins spent too many pages writing about the lame propaganda videos and didn't take the time to properly wrap up the story.  I am happy that the storyline ended the way I hoped it would since the very beginning, but it was disappointing that she wrote about it in a couple of paragraphs.  By the third book, I was emotionally invested in the characters... I wanted more details of *how* they reached that ending... not that the ending just happened.  It will be interesting to see how this third book translates to film.  I am kind of hoping they don't base it TOO much on \\"Mockingjay\\" because then the audience might fall asleep :(
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great game. Needs to replenish energy faster.  The game is free so why not get it already and try it for yourself.
0439023491|5.0|When my friends first told me about this series, they all told me that the second book was their favorite, so I had pretty high expectations.<br /><br />Catching Fire delivered all (and even THEN SOME) on those expectations!<br /><br />I felt like there was a twist and turn in every single chapter.  It kept me guessing and wanting to know what would happen to the group and what everyone's motives were in the arena.<br /><br />As with the first book, I liked the story being told from the point of view of Katniss.  She made all the emotions seem real and made me care about the characters.<br /><br />The pace of this book was also extremely enjoyable.  I finished this book in less than 2 days because I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />So, as with my friends, I would say this is my favorite book in the trilogy!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A fantastic app that works perfectly! Write down notes and (if you have Evernote installed on your computer), it syncs to your computer perfectly and seamlessly. Great app!
0439023483|5.0|I have to preface this by saying I didn't read the books until after I saw the movie for the first time.  I had seen the movie trailer but didn't know it was based on this book until my friends (who had read the trilogy when they first were published) told me.<br /><br />I was skeptical I'd actually read the books.  I tend to prefer non-fiction, business-type books.<br /><br />The movie was amazing, and I was blown away.  Immediately, I came to Amazon, ordered the entire trilogy, and read all 3 books in a matter of days.<br /><br />Regarding the first book in the series, The Hunger Games, I really enjoyed the way it was written in Katniss's point of view.  I loved the way she described everything so clearly and it made me wonder the same things she was wondering.  I could feel all the emotions and it was so engaging.  The story itself kept me wanting more.  I never wanted to put this book down.  I stayed up late reading, and read during odd moments of the day because I wanted to know more about what would happen next.  I also enjoyed the pacing of the story.  I didn't feel like there were lulls in the action or story.<br /><br />GREAT book! I love it.  I devoured it in a couple of days and went straight on to the second book!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|like a whole lot<br />like pioneer trail would recommend this game<br />my kids like it too and the fishing is a lot of fun
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Seriously digging this game. Easy to control for a tablet. It has many elements of a Mario game (minus a run button). More free updates please!

B0055SWM08|5.0|Game play is very easy, but puzzles get more difficult. Very entertaining. Worth the free download or even the pay download price.
0061438294|1.0|i dont usually make reviews but i had to on this one. I dont know where to start. I was really looking forward to reading this book and i had an open mind before hand. I got it because i love psychology and it had great reviews. Everyone said it was the best body language book out. If this is the best book on reading and analyzing body language then we have failed as a human race. IT IS PAINFULLY REPETITIVE AND what i learned from this book was<br />1. When we are happy we move our feet<br />2. when we are not we dont move our feet<br /><br />at times i really thought a 10 year old created this book. the author explained the dead obvious. like \\"when someone has to go somewhere they look at their watch a lot\\" who doesnt know that. and he would keep repeating it over and over. also the author rambled a lot. there was one point where he was saw a girl with bruises on her arm at a pool and kept talking about how bad it is to abuse children for almost 15 minutes. ..REALLY? there is so much more that i could talk about but bottom line is this book is for the socially retarted and i am advising you to keep away to save u the bore and time. unless you absolutely know NOTHING about body language and wanna know when someone is happy or sad then go for it.

B005TBWN0K|5.0|this app is awesome!!! its perfect for taking quick notes. I'm using it with my kindle fire and it is a great compliment to evernote. I use it with a touch pen to write down quick ideas or to take messages while on the phone.
B001FA0W5W|5.0|Great, easy-to-read book on the role of chance in markets (and success) vs. skills. There is too much focus on the great investors and how skilled they are vs. the role of chance. Humans tend to focus their attention on outliers, and in investing, these are the ones that achieve greater returns over time. However, the key message of the book is that this is not necessarily due to skils, but rather a result of pure chance (flipping the coin...)
B00003CXA2|3.0|I have read at least one person had the same problem as we did with there being commentary through out the movie that you could not turn off. After trying and trying my husband finally figured it out. Go into 'setup' and select the ' English 5.1 surround' and that should work. It did for us. :-)  enjoy.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app quite frequently for simple reminders, taking notes in class, even writing whole sections of a novel on the go. The color coding makes it very easy to categorise notes and find them again. And unlike many digital note-taking features, there is no line or character limit.
B00413QB5A|3.0|It is obviously an early work, still, you feel the potential of the writer. However, if you read the book after your have read the latest Follett novels, you are dissapointed. So, I would not recommend it among the first novels to be read by a Follett novice.
B0073U2F2Q|3.0|If you're looking for a quick fix of alien attack action, \\"The Darkest Hour Special Edition\\" will satisfy you. It's the simple story of a group of people trying to get from point A to point B without getting decimated by alien forces. Along the way, we get to see really cool incineration deaths and speculate who's going to get taken out next. You can't ask for much more than just being entertained from this type of film and it definitely does that.
0062060562|4.0|Our memories define us and connect us emotionally to our friends and loved ones. They form the basis for our past and present, but memory can be a tricky thing.<br /><br />S.J. Watson's debut novel, \\"Before I Go to Sleep,\\" is a psychological thriller that centers on a middle-aged woman in London. Christine Lucas suffers a traumatic brain injury that leaves her unable to retain long-term memories for more than 24 hours. Each day, Christine's memories of her life are wiped clean. She awakens in bed next to a man who claims he is her husband, but she has no memory of him or her own life. Each day, her husband, Ben, must re-orient Christine to who she is and the life they have shared. He posts photos in the bathroom and writes helpful messages on a white board.<br /><br />Christine struggles each day to piece together her life. With the help of a neuropsychologist, Doctor Ed Nash, who mysteriously contacts her, she begins to write in a journal each day. Dr. Nash tells her to read the journal each day to remember key facts about her life. After a time, she discovers her husband is withholding important facts about her life from her. She learns she published a novel and she bore a son, information her husband has withheld from her. She begins not to trust her husband.<br /><br />The journal is a clever device that allows Watson to slowly unfold a complex, multi-layered plot and parse out to the reader the puzzle pieces of Christine's life. When the journal suddenly ends seven days short of the point where the story begins, Christine and the reader are left to wonder what happened during that time.<br /><br />The pacing of the story is one of its strengths. It starts slowly as Watson brings the reader into Christine's frighteningly confusing head. As the story progresses, the tension and suspense build and the reader begins to doubt those who claim to love Christine. At one point, the reader is left to wonder who can be trusted.  Even the saintly Dr. Nash, who is painted as a model of altruism, becomes suspect in the reader's mind. Is he working for Ben? Why is Ben lying to Christine about their life together?<br /><br />One of the most intriguing aspects of this novel is Christine's internal struggle. At one point, her only desire is to feel normal. \\"To live like everybody else, with experience building on experience, each day shaping the next.\\" She thinks about growing old with no memories to hold onto, no accumulated wisdom to pass along. \\"What are we, if not an accumulation of our memories?\\"<br /><br />At another point later on, Christine feels she is going mad. \\"I wish I knew one thing for certain. One single thing that I have not had to be told, about which I do not need to be reminded.\\"<br /><br />After reading her journal one day, she reflects on the fragile state of a life without clear memories. \\"My life, I thought, is built on quicksand. It shifts from one day to the next...I am desperate for solid ground...\\" And that is the point here. Our memories, though sometimes faulty and self-serving, define who we are and how we relate to the people around us.<br /><br />Altered memory can serve as a cheap plot device or an intriguing technique for building suspense, most notably in movies like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the more recent Inception. It takes skill for a writer to use this device effectively. Watson draws on his experience as an audiologist for the National Health Service in Great Britain to create a chilling scenario.s a model of altruism, becomes suspect in the reader's mind.

B007549YM4|4.0|If you love \\"end-of-the-world\\" films, \\"The Divide DVD + Blu-ray Combo Pack\\" will be a treat. I'm almost positive that doomsday and films about nuclear destruction couldn't get any more disturbing and hopeless as this one. It is a perfect example of the lows humanity will go to when they're put in dangerous and potentially deadly situations. Needless to say, a lot of bad decisions are made abruptly.

B005KDDUVS|4.0|I read this book in its orginal language.  Ruiz Zafón uses a poetic, yet light vocabulary that does not betray the time period in which the book is set.  That alone was reason enough for me to keep reading.  However, the story is captivating enough to make a fairly quick read for me, even as I was trying to be a student of the style of Spanish of the narrator and all the characters.  Some elements for me were at times a little predictable, it was necessary to read to very end to have a full revelation.  I also appreciated some of the historical allusions, especially after having just read \\"The Time in Between\\"  (\\"El Tiempo Entre Costuras\\") by María Dueñas.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this is NOT right it is coping a best seller game this is not a goof game to play because you guys are giving them more things to make next thing you know they'll be making lep inside story like Mario and Luigi Browsers inside story.This is not right
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I am a very avid reader and i loved this book so much. Thomas wakes up in the lift and knows nothingbut his first name. When the lift doors open, Thomas finds a bunch of teenagers that have been expecting his arrival. It turns out that he is in a place called the Glade, in the center of an unsolvable maze guarded by hideous creatures that lurk it at night. For two whole years, a boy is delivered every 30 days, but the next day a girl arrives. She says something about the ending.<br /><br />Thomas must solve the maze and get the Gladers out, but to do that he has to remember his life before the lift and Glade.<br /><br />James put a pictures in your mindand takes twists and turns you wouldn't ever expect. This book will have you on the edge of your seat. zhow somebody comes up with this, I have no idea, but  loved it. So buy this book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The account is in my husbands name - but I'm his wife who received a Kindle Fire as a gift.  It was my first Book on my Kindle Fire - it was great.  I love the fact that I can change the font - highlight, and read in bed without a night light, so as not to disturb my husband whose sleeping.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never been a fan of romance so this is a first for me (maybe it was all the hot sex and the quite emotional history to the bad boy). I really enjoyed all 3 books, however, the ending of the third book seemed a bit rushed and hind sighted. I would have loved the back history to have been incorporated more into the story itself instead of what seemed like an afterthought. Also what happened in the last 2 years? There were details that were left out (the marriage of the Taylor's for one) and would have been a better filler than the going back and forth with Christian as a boy and his first impressions of Anastasia. Overall the books seem to be well thought out and written. I look forward to more works by this author.
B00701897I|3.0|I do not know much about The Adventures of Tintin the series.I purchased the movie mainly for the 3-d effect,I did not care much for the story,I did beleive the movie would have been better than it was,also the 3-d could have been better,it was okay though.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Pennsylvania rockers Halestorm continue to impress with their second album filled with good old fashioned, head banging Rock 'N' Roll played the way it should be. Lead by singer and guitarist Lzzy Hale along with guitarist Joe Hottinger, bass player Josh Smith and drummer Arejay Hale, Halestorm delivers 12 strong songs varying from fist pumping anthems like the first track, \\"Love Bites(So Do I)\\" or \\"Daughters Of Darkness\\" to heartfelt ballads like \\"Beautiful With You\\". Lzzy Hale's vocals are powerful and versitile as she can go from sweet and melodic to growling with the best of them and the band is tight with all 12 tracks mixed to emphasize that each musician knows how to play their weapon of choice. The songs are all effectively structured and the lyrics are well written rock tunes that deliver what we expect from this type of music without trying too hard or overdoing it. The band's writing comes across as a genuine. They present the  familiar themes of sex, love, rocking out and rebellion in their own style without making them sound cliche'. The band's passion for the music comes across in all 12 tracks and the album is stronger for it. All in all a very solid and well produced album of hard rock, plain and simple, the way it was meant to be. In an age of over-produced, synthetic junk, \\"The Strange Case Of...\\" is back to basics, down and dirty Rock 'N' Roll by a band that knows the meaning of the words and can back it up with their instruments and vocals!

B007R12TNQ|3.0|Well not for adults looking for a deep thought out plot<br /> my seven year old thought that it was a great movie and that is all that matters.
1451648537|4.0|This is an easy to read and candid biography of Steve Jobs based on interviews with Jobs himself from the last years of his life and many other people in his private and professional life. The book contains numerous quotes from Jobs and others. The book covers Jobs' life from birth to death and the companies he was involved in, particularly Apple and Pixar.<br /><br />My main reason for reading (auto-)biographies is to learn from people of great achievement. Unfortunately I feel this book focuses more on Jobs' quirky and often unpleasant personality, rather than the traits that made his work great. We do get to hear that he likes simplicity, attention to details and the user-experience, iterative product refinement, etc. We also hear that Jobs' father taught him even the hidden parts of things should be well-made, and that Jobs was fascinated by certain schools of design, etc. But I don't feel I really get into Jobs' head.

B000XUBF3I|5.0|...I like having the ebook to conveniently look stuff up. It is worth the purchase price to have a searchable volume handy without going through a very large website.<br /><br />I like Marla's method of cleaning. I have the focus of a goldfish when it comes to domestic tasks. She recommends 10-15 minute segments for most tasks. I find this just about right for me after working all day outside the home.<br /><br />She also emphasizes routines....little tasks that you incorporate into the morning, afternoon, and before bed. She gradually steps you into these, so there is less chance of burnout. Again, quite effective for me.<br /><br />I know some people have complained about the book and how her methods do not work for them. She very clearly states that these are a guideline for developing your own system that works for you. I have been implementing \\"baby steps\\" into reclaiming my home. It has made a huge difference. Plus, her routines such as putting out hot spots, and \\"Weekly Home Blessing Hour\\" have allowed me to maintain the areas I have uncluttered and cleaned.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoy her methods. The book may not be for everyone, but it's a great investment for me, and I am so happy to have found it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic game with excellent graphics and growth in challenge.  Perfect for adults and children.  Finally a game I don't mind them playing.  Excellent for building mental acuity.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|War Horse is a great movie.  I saw it in theaters and did not like it.  I even left before it was over.  But, once it came out on blu-ray I decided to rent it and try it again.  I loved it the second time.  If you want to see War Horse, I recommend renting it and watching it once or twice to make sure you like it, before writing it off like I did originally.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|Zodiac's first hour or so was excellent, however once the killer's populatrity dwindled so did my interest in the film, and the last hour and a half of the cartoonist looking for clues draaaaaaaaged on. The film does a good job of showing the public stop caring about the Zodiac killer but it's not good at keeping my interest in it for two and a half hours. Thanks Dave but I think I'll stick with Se7en.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Synopsis: Dan and Lynch are childhood friends. They've decided to go skiing on Mount Holliston in New England. Dan brings his gf, Parker, (who he's been dating for a year) with them, much to the chagrin of Lynch. The trio do some skiing during the day. But they are unhappy to find out the ski resort is closing early due to bad weather. So they manage to persuade the ski lift worker on duty to let them ride one more time. After the trio gets on the lift, he is the first ski lift operator is relieved by a coworker. The operator who is being relieved tells the new man there are three more on the lift. When the new man sees three people leaving the ski resort, he assumes that is the three his coworker told him about. So he shuts off the lift, leaving the real trio (the protagonists) stuck up on the lift. Unfortunately, it is Sunday and the resort won't be open again until Friday. That means the trio must find a way down from the lift that appears to be more than 30 feet off the ground.<br /><br />I like this movie. It's one of the few horror movies that make me feel as if this could truly happen to me. Most horror is supernatural. For example, I don't think I'll ever be in Lt. Ripley's position in the movie Alien. However, I do feel it's possible I could find myself in the position of the 3 protagonists. I like both movies. The fact that Alien couldn't happen does not diminish its horror for me. However, watching a horror movie that feels like it could really happen to me adds a different dimension to my viewing experience. That's one reason I like it. Plus, I could understand the characters. They seem cliched, sure. But it's not like the U.S. is short of people who look and act like them. C'mon. Plus, I began to sympathize with them as they were talking about their past, their hopes, and their goals. I sympathized with their determination to survive. Yes, there were cliches but I liked the characterization enough to recommend this movie.<br /><br />Now, I'll just address some of the gripes people had with this movie *SPOILERS*<br /><br />1. \\"How can the ski resort allow wolves to roam free on their territory? That's a poorly managed ski resort.\\" It's possible the wolves came from somewhere else and that was only a one time deal. If wolves come to the resort when it's closed all the time, I could still see it. The U.S. has wholesale cities that are ineptly run in some way or another. For example, Detroit is a city that is so poorly governed that people don't want to be there during daylight hours. San Antonio has a huge stray dog problem. There were stray dogs that managed to get through the gates of Lackland Air Force base and bite Air Force trainees. It's impossible to walk an hour through San Antonio and not see at least two stray dogs. The U.S. has such poorly managed cities. I don't think it's unlikely to see poorly managed businesses.<br /><br />2. \\"I'm an expert on the ropes they use on ski lifts. There's no way the ropes could be so hard they cut through your hands.\\" This was made on imdb. Another rope expert for ski resorts refuted this. Plus, the stuntman who did Lynch's stunts said they did cut his hands.<br /><br />3. \\"The mountains look like the Rocky Mountains, not mountains of New England.\\" I've never seen either the mountains of the Rockies or New England. Sue me. I didn't care. I agree, however, that it would have been smarter to set the movie in Utah where it was filmed instead of New England. However, movies do stupid stuff like that all the time. I just finished watching the Spanish-British horror movie called \\"the Abandoned\\". The movie was supposed to be set in Russia. But it was filmed in Bulgaria. In the movie, the filmmakers were trying to pass off obvious Bulgarian landmarks as Russian landmarks, which caused Bulgarian viewers to laugh scornfully. Just like \\"Frozen\\" \\"the Abandoned\\" didn't have any logical reason for setting the movie in a place that didn't further the plot. But, oh well, movies do this allthe time.<br /><br />4. \\"Why did he try to jump from the ski lift?\\" He brain was in panic mode. There are millions of examples of people doing stupid things while their brains are panicking.<br /><br />5. \\"If her hand was really that cold, she wouldn't put it on the ski lift.\\" Disagree. I've spent most of my life in some of the coldest States in the U.S. and parts of Canada. I've lived in both Dakotas. The Dakotas are easily in the top 5 coldest States in the U.S. One time I locked myself out of my house in Bismarck, North Dakota. In Bismarck, it gets so cold it makes my moustache hear feel like the strings on an electric guitar. Throw water on the ground, it'll turn to ice within 30 minutes. Imagine sleeping outside in this. When I was sleeping outside, I was huddled in a corner. I tossed in my sleep. My hat fell off and I woke up with my hair feeling so hard one strand of hair could cut carrots. So yes, I do believe when you're cold, tired, and miserable, you can sleep with your body exposed to the elements. So the character putting her hand on the sky lift metal is quite possible.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow! Just finished these books. Amazingly original. If you like end-of-the-world scifi, you'll love these.  I'll definitely be checking out more by this author.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Serene, requires thought, and generally a pleasant experience. Got it free, but it's worth buying.
B0044RFT8S|5.0|My copy arrived with a Blu-Ray and a DVD just as the packaging and product description states.  I was worried when I ordered it that I'd receive two DVDs like other reviews described, but there was no issue here.  We love the combo movies because we leave the Blu-Ray as a family time movie, kept in adult hands, while the kids can use the DVD in their room or to take with them in the car.  It's great that so many family movies get the double treatment.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this already, it is an entertaining kids movie that the adults will enjoy as well.  It's a \\"be careful what you wish for\\" and a \\"fish out of water\\" kind of situation for some zoo animals, some which wanted a taste of \\"The Wild\\" and others that were dragged along in the process.  There are plenty of laughs along the way and nothing here is particularly scary or intense.  The CGI isn't as dazzling as what the studios are doing in the present day, but it holds up pretty well due to the stylized look of the characters.<br /><br />It's a nice price and a great way to get geared up for the upcoming Madagascar 3 that hits theaters this summer... and I'm sure we will be purchasing that one too when it comes out on Blu-Ray.
1410430103|4.0|The Killing Floor by Lee Child is the first of the Jack Reacher series.  I have read several later stories, all of them out of order, but they are written so well that additional background is unnecessary.<br />Traveling around the country, curious to see more, Reacher is arrested for murder in a small town he's passing through.  Though he didn't kill anybody, a lot of people start trying to kill him and Reacher has to solve the murder to find out who they are.  He falls hard for a beautiful police woman and forms a friendship with one of the detectives, and they are pretty much three against the world.<br />Reacher is not your usual literary type character; he's simpler and more complicated, at the same time.  You can never be sure which way he will turn, or why, and that adds to the tight suspense that rumbles through the story like a fast breaking storm.  There is a lot of violence in the story because Reacher's reaction to violence is to meet it with extreme violence, which he delivers with unerring precision.<br />The story is brimming with action, adventure and mystery.  If you keep close track you can figure it out before the last chapter, but you'll have to work at it.  An enjoyable escape from the real world, but very hard to put down once started.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|but no... it doesn't appear to be an infringement - this is a standard gaming platform available with many gaming development software programs. Bottom line is - it hits the target audiencein a happy place... those of us who owned the nintendo NES when it wasn't &quot;retro&quot; will love this game. Those who are looking for crazy tilting controls and war games will not like it. the levels are simple and fun - and the graphics are sweet and g-rated. and yes... &quot;retro&quot;. have fun - I am!!!!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The books were amazing, the DVD series isn't too far behind! This was a wonderful companion to the book, although I almost wish I had seen the series before I read the books. In my opinion the books are 9/10 times better than the DVD, but this one was really close!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun for the whole family. my girls and I take turns. love it<br />wide variety of games. its very addicting so watch out!!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|one of my fav movies and now it is a game. I just can't get enough.  the movie theatre is amazing.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Kids love it and it has enough subtle adult humor and unexpected twists to keep parents from nodding off. We liked the \\"relationship- development\\" between the characters. As with all great animated feature movies you will need to watch it several times to pick up all of the nuances. Worth the money.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I think Lep's World is very entertaining and fun - it has good graphics, and the levels are challenging but fun and doable. It is quite similar to Mario Bros. which is a plus if you like Mario. I guess the only bad thing that I can think of about this game is how you can't replay levels. You just keep going forward, unless you lose all your lives. But all in all it's aa fun game and hey it's free so what have you got to lose?
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|Two Suns is a really beautiful overall CD. Each song fits in with the flow and nothing is out of place with the theme Natasha Khan has created. I absolutely recommend Two Suns along with Fur & Gold - both CD's are very similar and if you love one, you'll love the other. Not much I can add to the discussion that others haven't already said, other than 1) try and get the Japanese version of Two Suns which has 7 extra songs, and 2) if you love Bat For Lashes, check out Emmy The Great's second release called Virtue. It's in the same style as Bat For Lashes.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app is one of the best apps I have on my kindle fire (my brother has the same app for his ipad also loves it)  works well, easy to use, and the nice thing you can do is change from NIV to KJV and other versions
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Leps world is a very addicting game.. It is very fun. I rate it 5 stars.  This game is likd another version of Super Mario Bros. Buy this app!!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I usually am not a huge fan of straight puzzle games. However, Quell is thankfully an exception to that. It is beautifully animated and extremely fun. It is definitely a terrific app.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The game was very fun for awhile &amp; then Sid's pop up talking about the connection came up &amp; no matter what it didn't go away. so I reinstalled it &amp; now it says it's not compatible with my kindle fire. I'd like to play the game again so it'd be nice if you fixed the problem. Cause that's the dumbest thing ever.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. love playing it. i find it challenging and exciting. a very good game. it is awesome
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its impossible not to note its similarity to Mario but hey that's a good thing and its a good game
B0055SWM08|5.0|good app for passing the time, but still keeps u thinking.  some levels are harder than others. worth the small price.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this is the worst game i have ever played and i have played a handfull of bad games!! DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Games sometimes make me nervous. I grind my teeth while I play trying to get just the right move or combo or whatever. This game is so relaxing. The music and the color scheme and the game play just absorb and relax me. It has replaced the crossword as my bedtime unwind. Well done makers of Quell.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|TY ! It's a cool app, seein as how my new Android  tblt  isnt supported by Android marktplce/ google play. :( Do keep up great work G5! Tnk u again :)
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I like reading biographies and this one is right up there amongst the best I have read.<br /><br />It has a great story of how the author came to write the review and pulls no punches on the characteristics of Jobs much of whisch are not \\"nice\\".  I had no idea about that aspect of his life and how he interacted with others.<br /><br />However, for me the most enjoyable part was about reading how all those major Apple events came about - and in particular what was happening behind the scenes - a classic one being when iTunes Store was launched and the rest of the industry was flumoxed that the record companies agreed to allow iTunes to sell on-line @ 99 cents/song.
0345803485|1.0|Wish they also had a return policy for the Kindle download version! Holy f%^$ this book sucked! I wanted to smack both characters and it made me feel sick to my stomach. I usually love a good trilogy and typically download the next book the second I finish the first, but when this book ended and she threw herself on the bed, I imagined myself walking out her bedroom and slamming the door and screaming \\"Laters... NOT!\\" I couldn't care less about what happens to either one of them.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great! it reminds me a lot of Mario Bros when I was a kid I highly recommend it :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game. Good for passing the time whenever I'm bored in class. Some of the puzzles can be very challenging but, that's why it's a puzzle game ;)
B0055SWM08|5.0|If you looking for something to keep you occupied this is a game for you! I got it when it was free, and I am loving it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well it has fun mini games but the arent that good...it is worth the download though I like it....yeah three stars
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really like this app. It makes checking my email really easy. I highly recommend this, especially for Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the fact that you can open more games with the points youbearn on the others that makes it so you don't get tired of what your playing you can just unlock another game. I love it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am happy with this game it is definately worth the download! It is very addictive. It's cool that it was free.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|Awful...just awful...boring...stupid editing...largely unflattering conjecture of a legendary leader masked as heartfelt...a waste a splendid actors...wait for human history to settle on a legacy before making one up.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|First, I must say, I'm a huge Alicia Keys fan, even though she's happily married now, with an adorable kid.  This particular CD had been broken accidentally years ago, and I'm just now getting around to replacing it.  I got a great deal on Amazon.com, and it arrived very quickly after ordering! Amazon rocks!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|a couple levels are a little frustrating and not much replay value, but for the most part its good clean fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love my Kindle and the ease of getting books. I started reading this series becaue I had a month free of amazon prime. If it wasn't for that I probably would not have bought them on my own. After the first book I couldn't put my kindle down. Great books!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Nice music and calm graphics. The tips get repetitive and old quick. Simple to play, yet difficult to master. I recommend it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is amazing, I just downloaded it on my kindle fire, and while there is no cameras, there is tons of pics that come with it, and you can upload them!! I highly recommend this app.
0060558121|5.0|I recieved this book yesterday and am already 3 chapters into it. It's just one of those books that's sort of like Clive Barkers Great and Secret Show and Everville books. However it doesn't take two seperate 1000 page books to cover every step and honestly if you have a good imagination, like I do, you can see everything going on that is written in this book American Gods. It's basically the Gods' and deities of Ancient Lore meet and are at war between the realms and on this plane of existence with the modern Gods' and deities of Technology and Greed. If anyone that is into Ancient Gods' and SciFi kind of books then my friends this is one that you definitely should pick up a copy of and read it. It will blow your mind when the tale weaves itself all together with the character Low Key and the rest of the entourage troupe of deities and misfits. Love it. Thanks Neil Gaiman.
B00507ZQVQ|3.0|I love Aida, and this production is as usual a thing of beauty.  Blu-ray operas are the best.  But the camera angles from the pit, looking up the nostrils of the performers, are awful. And the ceiling shots, forget about those too. They are so bad I probably will not buy the Blu-ray of Turandot, for fear of more of the same. I miss Brian Large!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|my kids &amp; myself really enjoy this game. only reason for four stars instead of five is because some levels seem unbeatable. keep trynig togetmyself motivared
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this app. I find it doesn't get me hooked but perfect fun five-ten minutes at a time. 5 stars yes!!
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|Certainly for a short book of 100 +/- pages \\"Of Mice and Men\\" punches above its weight. The dreams and aspirations of working people, when well told can but full of poignancy and emotionally taut. That's definitely the case here. The language seems authentic. The setting is beautifully set and the dialogue paints as much of a picture as the descriptions that Steinbeck is so skillful and subtle at presenting.<br /><br />The boss's son, Curley is angry, small with a chip on his shoulder and jealousy triggered by a wife with a wandering eye who flirts full of entendres and innuendo with the men on the farm bringing immediate conflict to what seems to be an almost idyllic boarding house for farm workers in 1930's California. Contrasting with \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" here there seems to be fairness between boss and worker and clear rules of behavior, maybe even a code that everyone understands. If you show up for work on Saturday you get fed that night and all day Sunday before starting work Monday.  The world appears better 5 to 10 years after Tom Joad and family first arrived in CA in \\"Grapes\\".<br /><br />Big simple Lennie and smart little George look out for each other; travel and working as a team. Other workers see it as strange but respect and admire the bonding and friendship between these two. This is an easy story to like - fully expressed dreams of having your own place, working hard but controlling your destiny and sharing that with your best friend are near universal aspirations and told by Steinbeck it comes out beautifully. However I couldn't escape the lingering thought that different from other Steinbeck books this one felt a bit more dated. Lennie as big, big hearted but violent and feeble minded and George as diminutive smartaleky but warm hearted seemed a bit cliched. As a youngster I saw lots of books and movies with \\"the big lug\\" and his smart sidekick always looking out for each other but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. We don't see big people as less smart or small people as more intelligent. In fact it may be the opposite.<br /><br />Of course it's a great story. I loved the emotional pitch and the powerful ending but I'm left wondering if it has the timelessness of his other classics.e as less smart or small people as more intelligent. In fact it may be the opposite.<br /><br />Of course it's a great story. I loved the emotional pitch and the powerful ending but I'm left wondering if it has the timelessness of his other classics.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|amazing, i loved it from the start. but since an amazon kindle fire update or something i cant upload pics from my gallery onto it, or anything for that matter. until thats resolved, i frown at not editing my pics on here, it was so much fun and worked really well.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful movie, with a great performance from Johnny Depp.  It's a wild, wonderful two-hour NA meeting.  Maybe it's a type of anti-\\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" though without being the ordeal that that movie was.<br /><br />Worth a look.
0345803485|1.0|I read two or three novels a week. I ran out of my favorites. I'm male.  I've read the reviews and the first half of the first novel of the trilogy.  I really don't get it.  Theme seems to be the deflowering of a young woman by an S and M freak who is somehow supposed to be the Everyman who has everything.  If this is what young women of our day fantasize about, the world is in trouble. I really tried to give this book a chance, but I honestly couldn't put it down fast enough. Based on the reviews and the price, I feel cheated.  How does something like this get to the top of new release list?  There must be some cyber trick to get this drivel to the top of the list.  I'm far from a prude and like a good sex scene and don't shy away from love stories.  My advice, don't waste your money.
B0055SWM08|4.0|A relaxing game that is not too hard or too easy. It is worth buying. A good way to spend those spare minutes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful mix of great acting, sets, costumes, and unadulterated soapy drama. Very interesting pace of the show moves the plot and characters through time quickly without feeling like you missed anything.
1401233066|5.0|Still going strong -  I'm really enjoying the series. And the art for the covers by James Jean are always awesome. I'd recommend this to anyone, but start at the beginning.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the app is to high what if some one only get free apps. like me I only get free apps
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is awsum so many ppl should get it they would like it so much thats y ppl shuld get it
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love restaurant. story because I love baking and I love people being my neighbors. and I want to make my restaurant. really big the biggest restaurant you've ever seen.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game it runs better than pironer village on facebook fun fun fun to play while on break at work or waiting at the Dr office
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game was loads of fun. I would recommend it to anyone. who likes puzzle games. lots to play with lots of levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Can't. put it down. . ...va<br />gas style!  sometimes hard to see on my screen. but good game.Go ahead and get it
B006YXTRHY|2.0|I started watching Twilight because of my gf, I thought they're \\"OK\\", but this one is horrible. The whole baby thing was weird.<br /><br />And I noticed in so many scenes where no one was talking! Just pure silence!! o.O<br /><br />I usually like this kind of movies, about Vampires and all that.. So I started watching Vampire Diaries, it's waaaay better! From Acting/Actors, to music, to quality! Anyway, this is a Twilight review, and here it is.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really fun and great for a free game! Lep is a little creepy but it is still fun . Ner Brothers need to make more games.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Responsive app, quality graphics, good animations combined with good logic puzzles make this a great game. I recommend to all problem solvers!
B0065IA4F2|2.0|This is a big let down from Drake's last album.  Almost every song sounds the same.  It was a change of pace, for the worse.
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|The book presents a very interesting idea. But history and recent facts are distorted shamelessly to fit the theory. The authors could have avoidaded trying to use their framework to explain the roman empire, for example.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|I saw this play pop up on Broadway, so found this on Amazon to watch.  Loved it.  Finally got to see the moment with \\"STELLA!\\"  I've been hearing that forever, but had never seen the movie.  Glad I did.
B0040QYROK|5.0|Not only ahead of it's time, quite possibly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen.  Very sharp in blu-ray, whoever restored it did an outstanding job.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I like the game, but too tapping.  Over the last day or do you now have to tap to get your tips, the radio the coins and stars again to actually get them. All that tapping gets in the way of game play.  Also needs to be able to add neighbors using an easier method. By tapping on the resturant name.  A good use for tapping.
B0019NG73G|4.0|I like this movie.  Very well done, but very long, as it should be due to its subject matter.  Give the viewer a \\"you are there\\" feel to one of the greatest battles.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|The best $5 you can spend on music.  This is a very organic/bluesy/soulful record.  It's Otis Redding returned to earth as a 23 year old female.  If you haven't searched out any live recordings or seen them live...do it RIGHT NOW!  There's a great performance of \\"You Ain't Alone\\" on youtube [...].  Just incredible!  You can download their live perfomance at SXSW for free at npr.org.  The cd is very good, but this band really shows out live!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good game! its fun I recommend it i promise you wont regret it.  thisis your conscience speaking to u get the game its the right thing to do.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is such a Mario ripoff but who cares?  its super fun and its free!  how much more could you ask for?
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I love the game, but I beat the whole thing in one afternoon. there needs to be more levels. it was over way too soon. please add more levels and I'll add more stars to my review.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|I Loved Nicki Minaj first album. This album she talks about SEX a lot, Money A LOT, WOMEN A LOT, and MEN A LITTLE LOL. She is very cocky on this album talking about how she is the best ever and how people want her featured on there tracks. She is in no way humble. I can deal with RnB with pop music (Like Rihanna, who is my favorite singer)but this is too pop for me. The pop on her album has no Rnb feel at all, its like Lady Gaga music.The MAJORITY of the songs on the album are pop. I haven't found ONE song that I real like and want too listen to over and over again. The reason I am giving this album one star is because some songs are at least listenable. I would grade this album F
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loving this game. I just wish the energy didn't run out so quickly. Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun.
0345803485|1.0|If you can get through the AWFUL writing style and the internal dialogue of the main character, you probably are easily entertained and have low expectations. I would not waste the money.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this is the gayest game ever. do not even waste time with it.if you have a kindle fire doont get it or be prepared for glitch city
B0054JZC6E|3.0|If you're really bored and have time to kill its kinda fun. Not my favorite game app but it is not bad.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Truly a great tool and awesome app. I only wish the NLV was downloadable. I oftrn use this app for study snd even in service on my Kindle. Thumbs up Youversion!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|GREAT...GOD is good I love this app,my favorite out of all my others. easy to use,simple to read...i'm so thankful i can read the Word any time i need it./
B00785P2QC|5.0|I delly enjoyed it. I found it to be worthy of wasting my time. I like the fact that I don't have to be contected to the Internet to use it
B0055SWM08|5.0|Everything about this game is aesthetically pleasing and user friendly.  I'm a huge fan of puzzle games and this is my new favorite.  Plenty of levels and difficulty ramps at a reasonable pace.
1613821395|4.0|Several characters narrate incidents that make up the story of a devious scheme to rob a young heiress of her fortune through false identity and how the hero meticulously uncover the plot and rescued the damsel in distress.  Dickenesque good and evil characters, despite its Victorian pace and prose, it's an entertaining read.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Loving paranormal books, such as Kresley Cole and Larissa Ion, I really enjoyed this book. I did start reading the 2nd book and still have not finished it so, was a little disppointed in that... It had a great story line, passion was awesome and action equally great.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Every other remote desktop always had a buggy server application and extreme lag. Splashtop is a one time setup that works flawlessly every time after. Very handy to control my music on my computer from my phone.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It's easy to install and fits very well to the kindle. It feels nice, stylist, and sturdy. The cover can be folded to act as a stand (not so sturdy as a stand, but still good enough). The band makes it easy to secure the cover.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album is Beck's greatest feat and one of the albums in my top 5. Round the Bend is underappreciated in it's simplicity and beauty. Thes songs can haunt you.
B005DZMP00|5.0|Bill Graham ( owner of The Fillmore Auditoriums ) once said about THE GRATEFUL DEAD : \\" They're not only the best at what they do ~ they're the only ones who do what they do.\\" YUP! ... And this new release is them at their best. We enjoyed EUROPE '72 ( Other shows originally released in 1972 ) for years. Now they are sharing other performances of this tour. Its good ~ REAL good. ENJOY!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A couple months ago, I hadn't even heard of The Hunger Games or Catching Fire. Now, I'm happily immersed in the story. My girlfriend and her teenage kids were in various stages of reading the trilogy, and they introduced me to it. When her 13-year-old son tried describing the plot to me, I became minimally interested. Then I picked up the first book. Wham! Suzanne Collins' story hooked me hard. I've read the first two books, and I've seen the movie. I can hardly wait to read the third.<br /><br />I had just finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when I picked up The Hunger Games. I loved the suspense of Dragon Tattoo, and I was equally impressed with the gripping story of The Hunger Games. The story gets even better with Catching Fire, the second book. I can't get enough.<br /><br />Another novel I finished recently that compares favorably to Hunger Games and Dragon Tattoo is [[ASIN:0984959807 The Kurchatov Penetration]], a thriller about the Russian mafiya's efforts to steal and smuggle plutonium to feed the ravenous nuclear appetite of the Islamic Republic of Iran with the assistance of teenage American computer hacker Kent Dalton. Dalton has the brilliance of Tattoo's Salander character, but otherwise is quite different and unique. Also, with Iran's nuclear ambitions and Israel's sabotage of their nuclear program in the news almost daily, it seems that The Kurchatov Penetration could be closer to reality than fiction. It's a scary to think how near to the edge of a nuclear holocaust we ride. The Kurchatov Penetration is a real eye-opener.<br /><br />Hunger Games, Dragon Tattoo and Kurchatov Penetration provide tremendous suspense and intrigue. I highly recommend them all.
B000SO7OL6|3.0|I realize that Diana Krall is not the original performer on many if not all of thse tunes.  And many of these standards are at the very least ear pleasing.  Swonderful. The Look of Love, Fly Me To The Moon, All or Nothing At All, Peel Me  A Grape and some others have good melodies.  Diana is indeed in fine voice and there are some interesting solos by the guitarist, keyboards and bass.<br /><br />So why only a three star rating?  The songs themeselves are consistently on the slow side.  The first two tunes I really like so it does not matter so much.  But as the recording goes on for the tune of 75 minutes my interests turn elsewhere due to the sparse snail like pace of each song.  Fly Me To The Moon ends on a more upbeat note.  Its too bad that few of the other tunes had more of that upbeat feel.<br /><br />Nonetheless, these are standards galore that most should appreciate.

B005MYEPXC|2.0|I liked the movie - but I bought the blueray format and found that there was no dialog - there was background noise but the characters speaking lines were totally silent.  I thought it was a bad disk, but I put it in my computer and it worked fine.  For some reason, the blueray technology keeps \\"improving\\"  but my blueray player (Samsung) doesn't change.  Very frustrating....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have never felt more emotional over the three books. The Author E.L. James outstanding work.<br />I would love to seen alot more Christian Grey point of view in the first book, not in all the books just in the beginning.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I started playing and before I knew it an hour had passed. very peaceful music almost meditating, can kinda put you to sleep.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I loved this book. It was kooky and interested and despite being based on the tale of Cinderella, it kept surprising me.<br /><br />It was exciting and interesting but still appropriate for grades 7 or 8 and up. I'll be giving this book to young cousins as a birthday present for years to come.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there is absolutely no excuse to charge twelve whole dollars for an ebook. The publisher doesn't have to pay for the printing, or the delivery if it's an ebook, which reduces expenses substantially. In spite of this, the ebook costs more than the paperback!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Restaurant story is a pretty decent app. However&hellip;There is really nothing unique about. Yeah its a restaurant game&hellip; but there is just nothing exciting about it. I would prefer the Bakery Story game if your looking for something more&hellip;amazing or new.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books had me enthralled from the very beginning. I could not put them down and I found myself thinking about them every waking moment. A great story and a great message!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just bought it a few hours ago and am already addicted! !!!<br />I love it and I agree that it is like the original super Mario which I loved.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|First season was amazing and this set has it all. Great audio and video and lots of extras are included.  This show is not afraid to take the story in directions that may not be what you think you want but end up telling an amazing story.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is addicting but just like Mario.its fun.fun.fun.fun. I like it and I will recommend it to all of my friends with kindles
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game, atmosphere, graphics, smooth gameplay all top notch. Very relaxing and thought provoking. Each puzzle takes just a minute or two, so it easy to hop in and out.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Not the vast insanity of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" or residual torture of \\"Deer Hunter\\" but \\"Hurt Locker\\" achieves something trickier: to get inside the minds of soldiers the instant they face danger.  There are few cliche plot points, cliche conversations, or cinematic camera \\"tricks\\" to remind us we're watching a movie.  We don't even get to identify with a singular character's perspective until the final act.  War is neither glamorized nor condemned.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its quite a tub game to play similar to farmville but unique to its own play. great way to waste time. only downfall is the energy takes the play away till you regent more.
B001FB55L2|2.0|It's not only that Tobey Maguire was not up to playing a paranoid marine POW here.  It's just so obvious Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play THAT role instead of the slacker brother.  The major plot points are also handled in a bland awkward \\"TV movie-ish\\" way.  I cringed at the sappy ending narration over an uplifting U2 power ballad.  This guy is way damaged...why sugar coat it?  Finally, the father-son relationship was barely covered at all.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|It is very addicting and the graphics are good.I really like how I can change your background and your blade.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I am always skeptical when it comes to new lead singers but Mark Tornillo has stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park! After \\"Blood Of The Nations\\" I was highly impressed and curious if they could put out another awesome Metal album and they have with \\"Stalingrad\\".  Heavy Metal from the first song to the last.  You can listen to this new Accept line-up without even missing Udo, although he is doing good with his band as well.  This is a must have for any true Metal fan.  I also highly recommend the new Overkill CD \\"The Electric Age\\".
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|very useful for keeping track of ideas. not sure if the pay option is worth the expense but satisfied with free option so far<br />could use some guidance in app in using it at first
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This is the reason the format was created.  Beautiful picture, unbelievable 5.1 track, and entertaining content.  Couldn't ask for a more perfect blu-ray.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you enjoy playing Mario, then you will love this game. It s almost the same thing, but instead of playing for peach you aare playing for gold.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game. Lots of fun. It's reminiscent of Mario but its not a port. sometimes jumping/double jump is inconsistent. Hopefully the dev will keep updating it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|mind numbingly addicting little game. no time limits, makes this perfect for after work destress exercise, enjoy with a drink.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series. I've been thinking about re-reading the series, and I've only just got done reading them! I seriously love it, I have no clue what is so captivating about this story. Maybe that there is no other one like it, I don't know. If you don't have an imagination, don't read this book because the wording is a little repetitive, but I love this story.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the game was great at first. waiting for energy to regenerate was a little annoying but I was still having fun building up my town. then one night I go to check my town and half the town is properly working half is showing 142 hours to regenerate. my crops weren't growing and I couldn't replant any none of my animals were producing food. everytime I closed it out hoping it would have cleared up the time restarted back over 142hours. finally I just deleted very disappointed I had wasted so much time. gameloft website is full of similar complaints. don't waste your time until gameloft fixes the glitches!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music keeps me calm while I am trying to figure the puzzle out. It is a nice touch not feeling pressured to solve it as fast as humanly possible.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|These people who bash this film are the same group of losers who give substance to movies like the Artist, The Piano, and The English Patient.  Academy of motion picture idiots.  More movies that should never have been best picture.....Crash, Slum-dog millionaire.  I will skip the next awards show.<br /><br />Now on the the best thing of this movie is the way they tie it all together at the end.  Very suspenseful and very well done.  While this is not Star Wars or anything like it, I enjoyed every minute of the movie in 3D.  I will look forward to purchasing this on Blu-Ray 3D.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Overall I thought this game wad really good. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys puzzling but fun games with a hint of difficulty :)

B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and read it within 24 hours. I thought the book was descriptive and painted a complete picture of all the characters. Parts of the book were thought-provoking, and overall it definitely captured my attention from start to finish.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Lots of fun and very addictive. Only irritation is the fact that you constantly run low on energy.Works just fine on my kindle.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I too am tired of buying the same album over and over but at least this version of Aqualung sounds better than the previous versions.
B0061QD88S|5.0|My grandaughter loved it  Would recomend as a gift for children  they will have hours of enjoyment watching this movie
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Good movie. It's a funny movie; however, the story is about how some people treat others, and what others are capable of putting up with... to a point!
B000MV9026|5.0|My grandaughter loved it  Would recommend as a gift for children  they will have hours of enjoyment watching this movie
B0055SWM08|5.0|I haven't been this impressed with a mobile game in years.  The gameplay is very thought provoking.  The production of the game (menus, interstitials, etc.) is the best I've ever seen.<br /><br />I like the fact that the music is so soothing.  I usually leave the sound all the way off when I play mobile games unless I'm wearing earbuds.  But I don't mind turning this sound up a little, because it's not annoying or distracting.  The soothing music is a nice contrast to the difficult levels of the game.<br /><br />One thing I really appreciate is that you can \\"buy\\" hints if you get stuck.  On most levels you earn two coins for completing the level.  Then if you get stuck, you can buy a hint (which is a series of arrows showing you how to finish the level) for three coins.  So the pricing is just expensive enough to keep you from cheating on every level, but not so expensive that you can't buy yourself out of a jam.<br /><br />Well done!
1400076943|5.0|I loved Purple Hibiscus.  Chimamanda Adichie is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  This book is about a 15 year old girl named Kambili.  She tells the story of what her life was like growing up in a wealthy Nigerian household with an intensely religious father.  Her life revolved around her family.  The novel reflects this, as it is primarily about how Kambili's family teachers her how to become a stronger and more independent woman.  Kambili is originally very introverted, she does not do things for fun nor have friends.  She does her schoolwork and nothing else.  She has to be number one in her class or else she will get in trouble with her father, who is very religious, and very abusive.  The environment Kambili lives in is very oppressive and frightening.  Her role in the household is that of the dutiful daughter who does not question what the Church or her father tells her.  When Kambili starts spending time with her Aunt and cousins her view of the world starts to change, it becomes wider and she hesitantly starts questioning her father's practices like his extreme intolerance of other religions.<br /> It was not until the end of the novel that I paid any attention to the structure of the book.  Kambili tells the story in three parts, Palm Sunday, Before Palm Sunday, and After Palm Sunday.  Most of the book is about Before Palm Sunday.  I like the way it is set up.  The first chapter is actually the climax of the story.  Kambili's brother Jaja rebels against Eugene which starts a chain of events that will eventually set Kambili free.<br />  I am starting to notice that Adichie likes to give mute characters a voice through written words.  Kambili is such a frightened girl that she hardly ever speaks, and yet she is the narrator.  I like that Adichie does this because it shows a different view point, Kambili is not a heroin, but she is a protagonist. Reading the story of this very troubled family through Kambili's eyes brings an interesting perspective.<br /> The novel paints a very vivid picture of Nsukkah, a city in Nigeria that centers around a university.  Kambili's Aunt, Ifeoma, is a Professor at the university and is being accused of saying bad things about the way the university is run, which she indeed has done.  The politics of the university are a background to Kambili's story; you hear her cousins talking about the student riots, and the fact that Ifeoma has not been getting paid regularly, but Kambili never really comments on it.  However, Nsukkah creates a great place for Kambili to escape from her father's home.  The feeling in Aunty Ifeoma's house is the exact opposite of Kambili's house.  It is small and there is not always running water or electricity.  But more than that, Aunty Ifeoma's house is full of laughter and people talking openly and freely.  Kambili has a hard time adjusting to this at first because she is too afraid to speak, but she eventually learns how to stand up for herself.  In Nsukkah, the city of rioting students and controversial politics, Kambili learns how to express herself through words.<br /> Aunty Ifeoma and her daughter Amaka, serve as strong female role models for Kambili.  Aunt Ifeoma is nowhere near as rich as Eugene, but she is still a successful woman.  Aunty Ifeoma is a strong woman who does not need a man to be able to take care of herself and her three children.  She is educated and independent.  Amaka is very smart as well, and she is very passionate about social justice.  Amaka is the one who teaches Kambili to stand up for what is right and wrong.  She forces Kambili to stand up for herself.  Ifeoma and Amaka are not your stereotypical passive female characters.  Adichie often has characters in her novels that are strong, independent women, which is not usual in other forms of Nigerian literature and film.<br /> I loved Purple Hibiscus and cannot wait to spend my summer reading other novels by Adichie.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Ordered this set along with the zoo for grandson for Easter.  Loves going to the zoo and loves animals.  The animals fit in his hands and followed the older brother as he made them walk on my coffee table.  Entertained both boys for a long time.  Ordered it from Amazon.com and will order again.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|200 pages could of been saved if all reference/examples to how messed up/mentally screwed up Katness is was removed from the book.  Due to all the negative word of mouth I heard about this book I decided to rent it on CD and listen while I drive, thank god I did.  There is no way I would be able to read this book all the way through.
B00006DEF9|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"The Artist\\", you should see this. Not the same genre, but the same story told in a different way. I love this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game it is fairly easy to play. it does have a real money structure. I however have not had to spend any money to advance in the game.  it just takes more time to obtain goals.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its just a really fun and very addictive game that I could play it for hours but don't because its not healthy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and I have read it at least four times. Call me crazy but I am obsessed with it. Anyone who likes a really adventurous future for north America should read it. I went to the movie and it was AWESOME!!!!!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!
B006WXW098|5.0|Hearing the Scarlatti and Chopin included in this collection shot me back to a solo recital I had the pleasure of attending 2 years ago.  It was a dazzling display of virtuosity from this young artist and then came the encores which were an enchanting set all their own.  This fulfills my wish to have a recording to take home from that night.  These are all pieces Yuja Wang encores with and it is a pretty clever presentation to boot; it picks up with her playing Rachmaninov which is where she left off in her last release and follows with a well matched selection predominantly from the Romantic period.  To hear someone this young who has mastered the piano to this extent makes me examine my preconceptions about what it takes to be a seasoned classical musician (come to think of it there are a lot of impressive players these days under 30).  She has found the pocket between intellect and feeling and filled it with magnificent technique which is equal parts fury and nuance.<br />Encores are usually crowd pleasers and as well very personal in their nature.  They are the artist's choice for a parting gift.  The performer and audience bond even more tightly and it becomes their way of putting off goodbye.  Fantasia captures the feeling of celebration and triumph that comes with the territory.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|when i got<br />my phone there was a demo of this game on it i love it la la la la la la la la al la la la la
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smooth gameplay, soothing music, challenging but not frustrating. Easy to play, tons of levels. The graphics are simple (it's a puzzle game, after all) but are very appealing. Great game.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Brad Pitt gives an incredible performance in this film (Jonah Hill gives a surprisingly strong performance as well).  I'm a fan of sports and movies, but not so much movies about sports.  However, this movie is definitely well done, top to bottom.  I would definitely recommend this film to anybody that enjoys a heartfelt story.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|I haven't fully explored the bluray, so I can't comment on any extras.  What I can say is that this movie is incredible, probably one of the best I've ever seen.  I can't say enough about Kevin Spacey's performance, not to take anything away from Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, or the rest of the amazing supporting cast.  Brilliant film, I highly recommend it!
B00138KFYO|3.0|MP3 was easy to place in the cloud but hard to download on to my computer. I use Ubuntu 11.10 and couldn't download the album each song had to be downloaded one at a time.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I don't know why my high school didn't have us read this novel - it's a lovely book, and I found it easy to read and follow along. It's easy to see why this book has inspired so many other authors to draw from it and adapt the story to give it new spins... it's almost an archetypal \\"boy meets girl\\" story, including the wrinkles at the beginning that make them think they are all wrong for each other, when it's all just a matter of perception.<br /><br />Highly recommended, to anyone that reads!
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Cornwell is always fascinating with Anglo-Saxon history.  The novel is not disappointing.  I hope there is still more to come in this series.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It's a game I play once or twice a week before sleeping. Some levels are more challenging than others. I like to get perfect scores, so some take more time. Overall, Quell is a fun mind teaser.
0345803485|2.0|What I want to know is how this book got by an editor with any self respect. I thought the Twilight series was poorly written but this book makes that series look like literary genius. How hard could it be to get a thesaurus and look up another word for \\"peek?\\" I mean, \\"I peeked up at him through my lashes\\" is used about 600 times in this story. Really? Couldn't come up with something else by, oh say, page 100? And \\"whisper\\"......oh lord.....how many times? A million? The thing is, this is a really interesting story and with a little thought into the writing process, it might deserve to have it's best seller status. But, the way it is written makes me cringe. If you take away the content, it may as well have been written by a 6th grader.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This is a waste of money. The viewing area is reduced and it causes the kinect to have trouble finding my hands. When it does finally see me the movement on the screen is sporadic and tends to be jumpy. That said, you can stand a little closer with it on. The problem is that the kinect sensor doesn't work well with it on.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works flawlessly on my Samsung g tablet. love the variations and one click play although the one click play makes winning alot easier...
B0055SWM08|5.0|very cool game. It is challenging and fun. I haven't gotten tired of it yet. I love the tranquil music also.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy playing this game! Similar challenge to cut the rope. I would recommend it to anybody a good game that makes you think.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|best book next to the other two in the series....praise for suzane colins fast-paced and briliantly laid out<br />perfect i have read it like twenty times and still havn't gotten bored with it
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|There is not much more to say other than repeat the title - The Boss is Back and not too soon.
0671646788|5.0|I purchased this book a while ago at a local book store, and I finally finished it. This book shows you how to think big, using action to cure fear, turning victories into defeat, having faith, using persistence with experimentation (Thomas Edison performed 10,000 experiments before finally creating the light bulb - reference is in this book and the book \\"Think and Grow Rich\\"), overcoming excuses, thinking like a leader, and so much more.<br /><br />I loved in the leadership section of the book, an example was given on how to dismiss employees - such as helping them find jobs where their skills, attributes and qualities will be useful. This really opened up my eyes. Alot of the principles near the end of the book especially, related strongly to the popular book by Dale Carnegie \\"How to win friends and influence people.\\" The Magic Of Thinking Big was a pleasant read and I highly recommend it.
0307592731|5.0|I knew this book was about the author hiking the PCT.  I didn't know that she would also be writing about the loss of her mother, which was excrutiatingly real and very sad.  The story was much more than the hike itself, she touched on many aspects of her life and relationships up that point which helped you understand her journey.  This was such a good, well written, deeply moving memoir.
1579128149|5.0|This book is both informative and beautiful.  It's a large coffee table sized book, with beautiful pictures and a monograph on every element with pictures of the pure element (if possible) and some of its most common usages or unusually beautiful compounds.  It is a pleasure to look at if you are a scientist, or if you want your children to become interested in science.
0345803485|4.0|I'll start with the cons of this book.  Despite the main character's love for classic British literature, a literary great this book is not.  I doubt this author will be winning any grand awards, however I admire her for putting her dream into action and heck, I've never written a book so take my review as you will.  It's not that her writing is difficult to get through or anything, it's just evident that she hasn't been at this long and some of the same words and phrases keep popping up.  Just as Stephenie Meyer seems to love the word \\"chagrin\\", James loves to have her main character \\"fire up her mean machine\\" (relax it's just a laptop, haha I know it's THAT kind of book but get your mind out of the gutter)and the characters constant \\"crap\\"! and \\"what\\"?! inner dialogue exclamations get a little tiresome every time she is shocked by something Christian says or does.<br /><br />While reading this book I am glaringly reminded of two stories; again Twilight...Ana and Christian's relationship very much resemble that of Bella and Edward's struggle....Ana is very clumsy and awkward, doesn't feel she fits in anywhere, doesn't see her own beauty and constantly is in awe of Christian's good looks and the fact that he would choose someone as lowly and unattractive as herself.  I also think Christian's alternate lifestyle that he is proposing to her is somewhat similar to Bella's contemplations to join the vampire world (yes they're very different lifestyles, but they are both pretty out there and not something people find themselves routinely contemplating).<br /><br />I also see a lot of resemblance to Vivian and Edward in Pretty Woman.  Edward is constantly \\"scolding\\" Vivian, correcting her, teaching her manners I guess you would say....he's pretty dominate over her as he is a rich and powerful man and she is a lowly uneducated prostitute.  Ana is no prostitute, but she is definitely no where near Christian's level of financial or professional status and he is much more experienced and worldly than her.  Also there are a few lines that are darn near verbatim to the movie...Ana asking Christian if people always do what he tells them to do and often crossing Christian with her somewhat independent and spunky streaks (her sudden brave attitude when emailing him is very similar to Vivian telling Edward to stop calling her if he doesn't want her to answer the phone and getting him to play hooky from work).  Vivian and Ana both challenge Edward and Christian to be less uptight and cold in their everyday lives.<br /><br />All of that being said, I really do like this book.  It must be taken with a grain of salt as it's fairly unrealistic, but isn't that why we read?  To experience situations much unlike our own, to get lost in fantasies that you'd never admit to wanting to get lost in?  Would I want a man ordering me around, stalking me and punishing me if I crossed him?  Hell no, but it's exciting to read about.  While she may not be the best technical writer, James is a very good storyteller, and she makes the reader care about her characters.  I find myself anxious to get home from work so I can pick up where I left off, and find it difficult to put the book down.  So despite my many critiques, my last two points are ultimately what I use to judge the success of a book.  If I can't wait to read it and cannot put it down, it's a damn good book.<br /><br />Edited:  Since writing this review I have been educated on the world of fanfic...being that I love to read I am a little embarrassed to say I'd never heard of it before and was not aware that this started as Twilight fanfic, so that would of course explain the similarities to Twilight.  Whether or not the author also intended to mirror some characteristics of Pretty Woman or if it purely coincidence I have no idea.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This Book Was Extrordinary. i literally sat down and read it in 12 hours and i never read anything that fast. i have now finished the serise and am in the process of reading it again it was so good. Anyone out there who thinks they will not like this book will never again be suspicius.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I downloaded this game and I played it non stop.  nowise have to wait a day for things to do.  it did run smoothly but now I have to wait forever....  please please please fix this!!!!
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|After 2 months of use, one of the two batteries in the battery pack overheated and the battery pack no longer functioned.<br /><br />I went directly back to Mobee with the problem.  After sending them the requested pictures of the overheated battery, I was informed that they could not help me unless I had purchased the product directly from them or Apple.<br /><br />In other words, they would not honor their warranty  unless the product was purchased from them or Apple.<br /><br />I then contacted Amazon about the problem and received a replacement unit directly from Amazon.<br /><br />This is just another reason to purchase from Amazon.  Excellent Customer Service.  Not found with many companies these days.<br /><br />Thank you: Amazon<br /><br />The five star review refers to the charger when it worked and to Amazons handling of the problem.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great read, and if you like dystopian fiction, you will love this.<br />Without spoiling the story, the characters are well developed, complex, and even the worst baddy is shown to be so for a reason late in the story.<br />The \\"reality\\" in which the characters evolve is drip fed right through the length of the story rather than exposed straight up, so you get the sense of it as you read, as you get familiar with and attached to (at least some of) the characters.  Three quarters of the way through, you still discover some as yet unclarified - and sometimes deeply horrific - aspects of this world.  There are some excellent plot twists, right to the end of the book, which are incredibly well cued up, but still take (at least me!!) by surprise.  The environment is made real, familiar, in all its man-made industrial - rather than sci-fi - qualities.<br />I'll never be able to use a spiral staircase with a light heart again.<br />Now, I'm still trying to puzzle why this story is called \\"wool\\", but maybe I'm just dense.<br />Catherine
0439023513|4.0|I just wanted to quickly say that if you were expecting a love story from this series, then you will be disappointed.  This is about much more than that.  It is about war, governmental control, and choice.  The love story is a nice after-taste, but it is not the basis of the book.  Most people that I have heard complaining about the book did so because she didn't end up with Gale, or that they didn't get more of the kissing and gooey stuff.  I liked how it had a real happily ever after feel to it.  The pacing was a little bit slow in the first half, but still very enjoyable.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Although Lawrence always writes a lucid account of the subject I can't pretend to understand it all, but I enjoy the challenge! With just the right amount of humor, we are taken on a fascinating journey into another realm.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have fun building my own organ trail town, I'm sure you'll have fun with it too!<br />I gave 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I want to meet the author of this book and thank them myself for the most erotic fantasies I've ever experienced. I buried myself into this book, I rush home from work every day to read it. My husband was jealous because I pay more attention to it than him. It's so sensual, sexy, steamy, passionate. I am having a love affair with this book. As I read Ana's intense experiences, it was as if i was also experiencing it, lots of adjectives!! I recommend this book to men and women who would like to add some spice into their relationship. This book is classy, sexy, beautiful with a hint of darkness. Can't wait for the next one!!
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani gives us a awesome glimpse into the afterlife with as much detail as I have ever read of NDE's.  It is well worth the read, and perhaps as a result, it will encourage us to start living our lives fearlessly.  Remarkable story that cannot be denied.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How did this book get on the NY Best Sellers List?!  The writing was awful, I wanted to smack Ana everytime she made an excuse to be with some crazy guy who wants to spank her all the time.  She spends all her time with crossed fingers that he's not going to get mad and hurt her, I believe that's called domestic violence, not love... and worse of all if I ever have to hear the words \\"Inner Goddess\\" again I might just lose it completely!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the first series in a long time to totally hook me. It is a store about love and sex.  It makes you want to fall in love again.  There are some grammar issues, but most people can get over that. Not for any prude though. Very explicit love scenes.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The characters in this book snagged me from the moment I started. I couldn't get enough of the premise. Logan's determination and ability to keep hope alive kept me going and I wanted him to win out. The dynamic that Sparks included between all of the players kept the suspense going. Think this a favorite for me from this author.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Amazing workout and amazing results after only two times.  Great for a mom with two babies and hard enough to make the short time so worth it.  Excellent after pregnancy workout to help shed those baby pounds and set you back on a track of getting into shape and hard workouts.  Wish I had, had this after my first baby.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Never would have thought that I would be into this book. It sounded like nothing I had ever read before. Not my normal genre at all and I got hooked. It is a subject that doesn't come in the everyday and many terms I even had to look up but somehow the author lightens it up and the underlying story is really fascinating. Will be reading book two very soon.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a very enjoyable game. would highly recommend this game to everyone out there. hope to see you soon
0486281523|5.0|We gave this to my sons very cool math teacher, and he called my son \\"The Enigma\\" from that point on...just what did that mean? I know what an enigma is, but just the same..... Anyway, the teacher said he LOVED it, so we give it 5 stars....If you give it to your cool math teacher, perhaps he will think up a nice nick name for you, too!  MotherSquid
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was kind of into this book until around 83 percent. Then I just quit. It got to be very redundant, obnoxious and poorly written.<br />The same phrases were repeated over and over again... I got bored with Christian and was irritated at the main characters lack of backbone<br />and self respect. I only bought this book because it was on the best sellers list..and I still have yet to figure out why. Don't waste your<br />time..
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I will admit that I finished the whole thing in one day. It was compelling in a very simple way, and the story was interesting enough to keep my attention. I only paid $2.99 for the Kindle edition, so I would say it was worth the money.<br /><br />That being said, I am disappointed with this book. I was excited to read after seeing the reviews, but I must say that it fell short in my eyes. The characters were all very one dimensional and stereotypical. The writing leaves something to be desired, and there were many typos in the Kindle edition. I must say that I've both written and read better stories on fan fiction sites.<br /><br />If you're bored and looking for a quick, inexpensive read, then go for it. If you're looking for a real story, look elsewhere.
B004UID2LC|5.0|awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome! I love utube it is awesome and screw everyone who dislikes this app. awesome awesome awesome!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Wasnt expecting a literary treasure but the book provided what i did expect: easy reading.  The intimate scenes are surprisingly well worded and not vulgar, although some of the premises are a bit unbelievable. The characters are realistic enough to mke this above other works written in the same vein. Good fluff but i found some concepts a bit disturbing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Game is very smooth, pleasant graphics and fun game play. I recommend it to every puzzler. Filler filler filler filler filler
B004A8ZWWY|5.0|From all of the slap stick comedies out there these days, this was a very unique film.  It wasn't slap your knee funny, but it was very humorous in a suttle way.  It also had a lot more action/adventure in it then I was expecting which made it more entertaining. The cast, story and comedy in this film was all great together and all worked very well with each other.  Definitely recommended to any one looking for a good film to watch.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm satisfied with this app. It's great! Can't beat the price! Does everything that the description said it would do!
B004G8QHKO|3.0|You'd think that the popularity of their first three singles would have lead to a collection of music along the same wavelength.  \\"All of This\\", \\"Punching a Dream\\", and \\"Young Blood\\" were full of energy.  A lot of people agree, it was great workout music.  They were songs used in various video games, and TV series that would immediately grab your attention.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't take what worked and run in that direction for the entire album.  Even if it all sounded same-y, it would have at least made this album a great \\"mix album\\".<br /><br />The rest of the songs are just don't compare.  Most of it is just strange...without the same hooks and upbeat rhythms as the singles.  With the new songs on this album, I end up turning it down in the car to resume the conversation with my travelling companion, then turning it back up when the next single comes on.  Its just one of THOSE kinds of albums.  So I took the singles, added them to some play lists and left the rest of it on the hard drive on my PC.<br /><br />So I recommend taking the singles and leaving the rest of the album.  Maybe if they produce a second album, they will realize what made us track them down in the first place.
B006362ZR6|5.0|The Fray is one of the biggest names in rock today. I have been a fan of theirs since `How To Save A Life' was released in 2005. Since then this band has been coming back stronger really trying to create a stand out image for themselves and now with `Scars & Stories' they advance one more step.<br /><br />This album is a great listen from start to finish. Each song is different and unique and draws from so many emotions. I have to admit when I heard the song `Munich' for the first time I did get a little misty eyed. They do feature their original sound in the song `Heartbeat' and give you so much more with the rest of the songs, like `The Wind', `Rainy Zurich' and '48 to Go' A Fray fan would adore this album and a first time listener would appreciate it too.<br /><br />As of now I would consider this album one of the best that has come out in 2012. With such a strong 3rd release and this band seeming to sound better each time around I am very eager to see what their next album will sound like.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I had originally purchased this case: [[ASIN:B0079R8IYW Marware Exchange Case Cover with Stand for Kindle Fire]]<br /><br />I did not like the overall feel of it and the design of the \\"stand\\" didn't work so well for me...<br /><br />This case has a much better design and the upright stand is much more functional..although, this case does not have the function to go into a typing position, but i can live without that.
B0068RHGJM|3.0|Nightwish is a band I have been following for about 10 years and `Imaginarium' was an album I was looking forward to because I did like `Dark Passion Play' with their new lead singer. I was eager to see where the band would go with their next release.<br /><br />I have to say that while this album is an original concept record in their library the album itself is just not as good as ones like `Oceanborn', or `Wishmaster' Still, there are positives scattered all over the album. Each song is very different, each a different sound and music style. There is a very soft jazzy sounding `Slow Love Slow', a very exotic instrumental in `Arabesque' and of course `Scaretale' which sounds like it belongs in a Tim Burton movie. Of course you also have the classic Nightwish sound in songs like `Storytime' and `I Want My Tears Back'. I also noticed since they switched singers they now have epics in their albums and this time around `Song of Myself' is just too long and boring especially with the dialogue that takes up the last 4 minutes of the song.<br /><br />If you have never heard a Nightwish album and are interested in getting into this band you cannot start with this one. Once you have dabbled in a bit of Nightwishs' amazing past, `Imaginarium might be a safe listen at best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book of the hunger games series was amazing. It left it ending at a perfect spot I just couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend this if ou have read the other two.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Rarely does a film get released with such anticipation. Not the kind of anticipation you would get from a Harry Potter or Star Wars film. Every now and again a film about a real point in time that caused a major change in history is released and since the new millennium none were priased as `The Help'<br /><br />This is a film based on a fantastic book about women growing up in the deep south in the early 1960s and the African American women that helped them in their everyday lives. Yet, in this time there was only a select few that knew that times were changing. In this film that person was enveloped in a girl named Skeeter, who knew there was an important story to tell that these Black women were afraid to tell, but had no idea what it would do to two races of people.<br /><br />I was fortunate to read this novel and I have to say that this was an incredible film adaption. The ensemble cast was amazing and the story is so heartwarming and uplifting. While this film does revolve around females it is by no means a `chick flick'. It is a story about hope and learning to step up and take a chance for what you believe in. Even if you have no idea what the consequences will be. `The Help is a great film that tells the story about a time in American history that is not really touched upon in such depth and this movie really brings out the humanity in the time and it is a true classic.

B006JTS5WQ|4.0|Certain things in this world will never die, but sometimes they will take a long nap until they come back into the limelight. This time it is that wonderful one of a kind cast of characters that are The Muppets.<br /><br />The Muppets are just truly special and while the last few movies may not have been the greatest whenever the Muppets come back to the big screen you better know I am gonna be there. `The Muppets' is a very different Muppet movie because it is really a tribute to them from the fans that missed them and just plain adore them. Jason Siegel wanted to bring them back for a whole new generation to enjoy and while the movie is great there is just a little something missing. Still, it's not that what is missing can be found because it is the voices of the characters, but unfortunately the original cast is just getting to that point where they can't work at it anymore. Still, it is a film that wants to preserve the magic that Jim Henson created over 50 years ago and as a movie on its own it is a great movie. The soundtrack is not the greatest, but the more you listen to it the more you learn to like it. I feel that this Muppet movie is going to start something big for the next few years more films and even a new TV show is in the works.<br /><br />We just can't have a world without these great characters and this time around the movie itself shows us just how great The Muppets truly are. If you are a Muppets fan you are going to love all the classic stuff thrown into the new film as well as all the guest starts and blend a few new things into the mix you have yourself a true and fun Muppet movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great and fun for the whole family!  My kids and I love it as do a few friends at work who tried it out during our lunch break.  Highly recommended and I hope there's a sequel!
B005J4TLN4|5.0|The tagline of this film says it all, `Inner City meets Outter Space'. `Attack The Block' is the first attempt at directing for Edgar Wrights right hand man Joe Cornish. What he gives us is 90 minutes of pure cult classic fun. This is a movie that I never would have known about if it was not buzzed about on YouTube and I loved every bit of it.<br /><br />The movie has a great cast including Nick Frost, but what amazes me is how much was able to be fit into this movie. You have moments that scare you and moments that make laugh out loud and this is why we go to the movies in the first place.  There is not much I really can say without spoiling it , but like the tagline how could miss this one?
B000002IST|5.0|People who complain about Genesis's alleged \\"fading lights\\" are certainly entitled to their nostalgia. I'm, personally, not prone to that.<br />Musicians, like any creative artist, can't and shouldn't stay in the past. Most of the time, this dwelling in the past does not work, neither creatively nor commercially.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I have loved Puss In Boots since he made his first appearance in `Shrek 2'. When I heard he was going to have his own movie I was more than excited.<br /><br />`Puss In Boots' is a great film for many reasons. It is a great origin story about this character and I was very impressed that they did not give you any hits or leeway towards any of the Shrek Films. The cast (minus Zach Galifanakis for me at least) was great. Selma Hayak and Antonio Banderas have always had great on screen chemistry, just watch `Desperado'. Lending their voices to this film they still have that great chemistry that just makes you enjoy their work from beginning to end. Also, while there are no hints to Shrek in this film there are just traditional pop culture references and one of a kind jokes that made the Shrek universe a fun place to be and `Puss In Boots' gives that you as well. There are some parts in this film that will make you laugh so hard and parts that will make you laugh even harder.<br /><br />`Puss In Boots' is a winner a great animated film destined to become a classic and if there is a sequel on the way, bring it!
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book.  First heard about it on a radio show and was intrigued... I love reading books written about and by local places and authors.  Was fascinated from the first page.  Not always positively but fascinated with every page, twist and turn.  A true story of courage and grit filled with honesty (sometimes you might even think TMI).  I don't think I would ever have been able to do what she did but loved living it vicariously.  Highly recommend.

B0060MYK7G|4.0|THE BORGIAS is back on screen and Season 2 is  a welcome return. As last season progressed the series became a bit fragmented, but those seeds of subplots are now coming to be fleshed out. The cast remains the same (except some of last season's actors have already been knocked off, like poor Paolo).  Neil Jordan still is the major influence and he is ably served by Jeremy Irons, (Rodrigo Borgia) the wonderful François Arnaud (Cesare Borgia), Holliday Grainger (Lucrezia Borgia), Lotte Verbeek (Giulia Farnese), David Oakes (Juan Borgia), Colm Feore (Giuliano Della Rovere), et al.  One major change that is very positive - the art of the opening credits are truly creative and historically informed and simply fine graphics.  Here is to another season with the cruelest family that ever lived!  Grady Harp, April 12
B000NQRE1E|4.0|Titanic wasn't the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it's by far the best and will never, ever be bettered. Cameron's minute attention to detail, commitment to realism, and epic vision are light years ahead of the German Propaganda version, a Night to Remember (where the ship sinks whole), the dull Catherine Zeta Jones version, or the tawdry ITV mini-series.<br /><br />The hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter. Nope! Titanic went on to be a $2 billion hit and scoop 11 Academy Awards.<br /><br />Despite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons. But I think Titanic is more than that and doesn't deserve any nit-picking. It's easy to focus on inconsequential details, but Titanic has few faults. The worst I can say of it is that Leo DiCaprio's acting is sometimes a bit aggravating. Apparently Macauley Culkin was considered for the part of Jack Dawson. Now THAT was have been awesome.<br /><br />Many snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting. It's hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time (not including the 84 year time-span of the story). But the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle. I don't even think that Billy Zane comes across as a caricature, as others have gleefully pointed out. Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character. I know he's the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.<br /><br />Once the iceberg hits, at the 100-minute mark, the editing and timing (not quite real-time, but close) is perfect. The growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING. The hole in the hull doesn't seem to be a problem at first, but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomed.<br /><br />In a way it's an end-of-the-world movie as much as a romance or disaster. The Titanic was a microcosm of human society, and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny, fragile speck on a dark, unforgiving ocean. Even as a child, long before I ever saw the film, I thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealth.<br /><br />It's a very different film from Terminator or True Lies, but James Cameron has always kept a gritty, earthy tone to his movie. Titanic isn't, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.<br /><br />I don't think it's the best movie ever, but it scores almost full marks for everything. Titanic deserves to be seen on the big screen, which is why I have only seen it twice. The new 3D conversion looks great, and with a few corrections to the content of the film, and the digital projection itself, now really IS the time to revisit the ship.he growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING.

B004XNPQUO|4.0|The game uses the proprty of physics (graviational effects) to cause projectiles to bend around large gravitational bodies.  It takes a few efforts to get the hang of the effects but once mastered, provides some very challenging puzzles that make it difficult but not impossible to send projectiles to their ultimate target(s).  I fun and nice break from games that emphasize graphic glitz over the true game fundamentals.

1612930727|5.0|This man was a phenomenon, and each of his books a pearl in the field of self-help literature.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great App for a quickie weather forcast. It is a National view of weather patterns and is fairly accurate. Your local TV forcasts may be more accurate, if you need specific information for a smaller area. The weather map showing where tenative or current storms are cannot be beat. It has saved our bacon more than once when planning activities. If you wish weather information, the weather channel app definately has all most people would require. Make sure you have this on your Droid...........awsome app!

0439023513|3.0|If you are looking for closure like me, then you will finally get it with this book.  I almost hated to say goodbye to the characters, but so many of them went through the ringer, they were barely recognizable.  I liked the George Orwell 1984 flavor because I imagine kids today won't ever read that. There were some aspects of the Revolution which were poorly developed and other aspects which we just did not need; perhaps Collins was trying so hard to wrap up everything that it became overwhelming.  Although this book does not do justice to the series, I still recommend it to anyone who took the time to read Catching Fire.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|energy only bad thing<br /> but otherwise this is a really good game and I really enjoy it. gets five stars from me.
B003HZW26U|5.0|A friend recommended this book and I am happy to pass that on. I was concerned about reading it because after \\"Marly\\" I wasn't into another my-dog-died book (no spoiler, you know this right away). This is written by a wise and wonderful dog...sounds ridiculous, but a more compassionate and insightful book would be hard to find. I've never read anything like it; the love and respect shared by the dog and his owner shines through every page and every event. The difficult topics that are covered are although told without flinching, are handled in a sensitive way that is accepting and healing, and there are laugh out loud, sweet parts too. It's been a long time since a book has stayed with me like this one has. I wish I was as articulate as the author in conveying just how special this read is.

B005PTYOTE|4.0|I must admit that this package wasn't on my list to pick up as I wasn't particularly impressed when I saw all three movies at the theater. I remembered them being entertaining with lots of action but other details didn't stick with me. When I saw this just for $17.99 on Easter Sunday, April 4 I couldn't resist the temptation and ordered it.<br /><br />Mission Impossible (my rating: 4 star) is actually a very decent effort and the movie is loyal to the original TV series with look and feel of it, including the storytelling style. Ethan Hunt and his team go on a mission to retrieve a list that contains the names of secret agents but the operation goes wrong and Ethan finds himself trying to uncover the list and the identity of the mysterious mole named \\"job\\".<br /><br />Mission Impossible II (my rating: 3 stars) Unfortunately this movie is probably the weakest installment in the entire franchise. It is not even remotely close to the original. Actually, the basic plot line is not that terrible and there are some redeeming qualities. However, the first act is ruined by the romance between Ethan and Nyah which is built on empty dialogues, cheesy lines, not to mention the  ridiculous car race scene where both cars get tangled and spin out of control. However none of this is match to what happens in the last 20 minutes of the movie which is pretty much filled with one nonsense action scene after another, cars flying in air, crashing into one another exploding, motorcycle race, Ethan and Sean riding their motorcycles toward each other and jumping in air, colliding with each other in mid-air with 80 miles per hour speed and never-ending fight sequence with lots of karate gimmicks. I understand that action movies are not always believable and they are not supposed to be realistic but there is a line and Mission Impossible 3 crosses that line by miles (John Woo may be technically a potent director with technical skills and I admit each action scene is filmed perfectly but that's not enough to make a good movie).<br /><br />Mission Impossible III (my rating is 5 star). I can honestly say this movie is the saving grace of this box set. Some might rightfully argue it is even better than the first one. It is not as loyal to the original TV series as the first one is but it is very entertaining and moves with excellent speed. It has some incredible action scenes, gun fighting and explosions, but it still manages to stay within certain limits. Mission Impossible III is only second to Mission Impossible IV The Ghost Protocol which is not part of this box set.<br /><br />Overall, I think this a great box set especially for $17.99. I am not sure about the criticism about the lack of lossless audio some other reviewers mention. I understand lossless (uncompressed audio) is the clearest sound available but then again there are many Blu-ray titles that don't have uncompressed audio but they still have, as all these 3 movies have, 5.1 DTS HD audio which is still great.'s not enough to make a good movie).<br /><br />Mission Impossible III (my rating is 5 star).

B007PBKG5G|5.0|This album is so good, the best $5 I have spent in years.  I don't normally write reviews on music - music is subjective and you need to listen for yourself to decide, but this album is so different and refreshing from what most are doing right now, I feel compelled to promote it.<br /><br />Forgive me for the comparison, but this album sounds like Otis Redding and Janice Joplin had a daughter backed up by Duane Allman.  Brittany Howard's vocals are flat out amazing - thank god she didn't end up singing American Idol generica, I am sure there are producers who would have loved to snap her up and steer her that way.<br /><br />Please listen to this album, buy it, tell your friends - that's the only way to keep this kind of music going.  The album's first track, \\"Hold On\\" is, in my humble opinion, the only track with a radio-friendly hook, so I don't expect any other tracks will get much air-time, but here's hoping.

B006H5120E|5.0|I just saw this film in IMAX 3D and was amazed by the images feeling so real as if it were shot like Avatar in true 3D...We all know that Avatar in 3D was Incredibly impressive with its cutting edge technology.  Cameron has always been one to successfully push the limits of the theater experience and TITANIC 3D is nothing shy of this.  The sound was amazing.  far better than the original release.  The sinking of Titanic was 100% entirely a new experience compared to the rather \\"flat\\" original release in 1997.<br />This is a \\"Must Own\\" for any BLU RAY 3D collection.<br />I am placing my preorder for the 5 disk right now.

0345803485|2.0|Ok, so I bought this book because it was on the top bestsellers list for so long.  I wanted to see what all the \\"buzz\\" was about.  How surprised I was to find out it was the closest thing  to female erotica that I have read.  But my interest in psychology kept me reading.  After just thinking, this guy is \\"F'd UP!\\" I began to think of the possibilities of how he got that way.  That made me keep reading on.<br /><br />Since 1970's fiction, I have never seen an author use the word \\"er...\\" so many times.  I felt like I was listening to Scooby Doo cartoon dialogue.<br /><br />And her switches between her inner thinking got confusing.  She should have used much more italics...or less?  Awkward.<br /><br />Her attempt at first person POV, present tense, just didn't thrill me after coming right off reading the HUNGER GAMES, which pulled it off fabulously.<br /><br />Truly, I'm most curious to see who is buying this book...men? women? both?<br /><br />I had a hard time picturing a guy with grey eyes and copper hair.  Couldn't rap my imagination around that one.  If it had been dark brown hair, maybe????
0545265355|4.0|I'm going to start by saying that I think The Hunger Games trilogy is worth reading, especially because it is such an easy read.  It only took me about 5 hours per book max.  This novel is such a refreshing change from many of the young adult novels that are popular right now.  I have a love-hate relationship with Katniss, but I do love that she is such a strong female character, and I feel that teenage girls could really benefit from reading about her.  In particular, I don't mean to bash Twilight (it's a decent plane ride book), but I have to say that Bella is an EXTREMELY weak female role.  So Katniss was refreshing, although not a one-hundred percent likeable - I only say this because she seems rather selfish at times except when it comes to her sister, but I feel like the makes her all the more realistic. I also thought most of the other characters were decently in-depth (I really liked Peeta because he seems to balance Katniss out with his selflessness).  I found Gale and Peeta's undying love for Katniss a tad ridiculous at first (especially since she wouldn't really reciprocate, but they kept going back to her), but this gets better in the end when you realize there are limitations.<br /><br />I don't think The Hunger Games trilogy are the most well-written books I've ever read, as the sentences seem kind of lifeless at some points.  However, it is supposed to be written from the perspective of a 15 - 16 year old girl who is somewhat detached from most of the world, so maybe that makes up for it.  What I really liked about this book though were all of the in depth themes and symbols throughout the novel that I feel really set it apart from most young adult novels.  For example, the concept of reality is an extremely important theme in this novel.  Throughout the novel, reality television is shown in a very negative light, raising questions of where we're going with reality television in present day.  Also, the fact that most things in The Hunger Game are staged, like the romance between Katniss and Peeta; how it's all about giving the people a good show.  This could certainly relate to present-day shows like Jersey Shore, which are obviously staged and appeal to people by showing the most ridiculous, outlandish scenarios possible, and shows like the Bachelor which plays on the fact that people love watching romance happening (faked or not).  But this theme also extends, and eventually brings up the question of what is real and what is not real, such as in the third book when Peeta cannot separate his memories anymore and actually plays the \\"Real or Not Real\\" game.  Or how Katniss can never decide if her romance, even though it's staged, is real or not real; how she has trouble separating reality from her acting.  There are also themes of competition, survivial, etc and several symbols (like the flowers on Rue being a symbol of rebellion - that's pretty much spelled out for you, although there are many that are not).<br /><br />I don't believe that The Hunger Games is new classic, but I feel that ESPECIALLY for a young adult novel it will manage to both captivate a teenager (or adult!) with its plot and romance aspects and at the same time hopefully get them to think about some of the issues and questions that the novel raises about human nature and society.  I also feel that you cannot just read the first one and base your opinion on the series from it.  The novels really have to be taken all together to understand the full themes and concepts that these books cover.<br /><br />Lastly, I wanted to mention that before I read the novels I'd heard a lot of negative comments about how this is just a worse version of Battle Royale.  The idea of pitting humans against each other in mortal combat is not an original idea, of course.  Battle Royale wasn't even the first to use that idea, although it may have been the first to use children (I'm not sure).  There are others: The Running Man, the Most Dangerous Game, and then the movie The Condemned came out before this as well and it's pretty similar.  So no, it's not 100% original, but what novel is really?  There is also an entire genre of dystopian novels, of course, many of which tend to involve someone getting fed up and trying to take down a dictator or something similar to that.  However, I feel that the author manages to make it unique enough from other novels to where you're not just reading Farenheit 451, 1984, and Battle Royale put together, so that really wasn't a big issue for me.

0439023483|5.0|In order to allow my 5th grade daughter (who has a great appetite for reading and reads well above her grade level), I tend to read books before I will allow her to read them, particularly if they are controversial in any way. I'd not considered Hunger Games at all, and I'd been seeing a lot of hype about it in the social media outlets.<br /><br />I decided to bite the bullet and buy all three books, in hard-back.  I figured if it was a good enough series, I would re-read them often. Generally, I'll wait for all books in paperback, but since book 3 only just came out, I knew I'd have to wait awhile.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Hunger Games!  It certainly made me think about what life might be like in a post-apocalyptic world. (as a Christian, I don't believe I'll be here when it happens). It is a harsh read at times. When they talk about Katniss being naked before people (her prep team) who are basically strangers, it's hard to conceive. And children as young as 12, killing other children? It's hard to explain that to an 11 year old.<br /><br />But...it does open your eyes to how a world might try to survive after an apocalyptic battle. And you see the haves and have-nots still exist no matter what type of society you're living in. This just punctuates our world.<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone read this...especially if you have children who have read it or are interested in reading it. It can open the door to some great discussions!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|The fact that this is five star rated speaks more to the lack of selection on the Fire than to the game's quality. It's ok. Controls fine but literally no reason to play this if you've ever played a Mario game as this does the same stuff but not as well.

I found this book hard to get into and for me it really didn't start to take off until the last ten chapters. The book was written well had a good plot and the whole story came together and ended well. For me personally just wasn't one of my favorites. But all in all still a good book in general.

B006TVQTHW|5.0|The Antec 302 mid tower case is a great case in a little package. I purchased this for a full ATX Asus board which fits with out any problems what so ever. The 302 is a revamping of the gamers favorite case , the 300. With new design features such as tooless drive bays and cable management holes in the back plane, the 302 is improved over it's brother , the 300. The 6 HHD bays are accessed from the side and the 3 x 5.25\\" bays on the front are easy to use and are accessed via a swing out front panel that unlatch from the side. I would have liked a 3.5\\" adapter for the front drive bays, but is not a deal buster. It also has two places for SSD/ 2.5\\" drive units on the chassis floor and back plane, but I prefer to mount them in the HHD drive slots using an aftermarket adapter for 3.5\\" to 2.5\\" drive.<br />The case will fit ATX, Micro ATX, and Mini-ITX motherboards and has 8 expansion slots for PCI cards. The chassis is wide enough for a 12.5\\" graphics card and is deep enough to fit most any air or water cooling system. It does have two grommeted holes in the top of the case for external water cooling or cables. I managed to install an Antec Kuhler 920 water cooler without any problems what so ever. The bottom of the case is vented and has a dust screen on it for a bottom mounted power supply. The dust screen removes from the side for ease of cleaning. It also has a dust screen on the front of the case that can be removed for cleaning.<br />While the case comes with a top mounted 140mm exhaust fan and 120mm rear exhaust fan, the case can also be fitted with 2 x 120mm fans in the front, as well as, a 120mm fan on the side to cool the graphics card and a 120mm fan on the back side behind the motherboard to cool the CPU from the back. As for the front header, there are 2 USB 3.0 connectors that plug into the motherboard and the headphone and mic jack with the power and reset button and the HHD activity led and power led.<br />This is a great little case and is about the size of the old Antec 900 series and is slightly larger than the 300 for added cable management and has 4 holes to route the cables through and the back plane. It is solid and well build as with most Antec procucts...I have used them for years for their value, quality and design.<br />Even though the price is somewhat higher than the 300, the added features are worth it. It is still a great value for the money and is worth it for the tooless drive bays and the space for cable management. The only case I would have considered over this one is the Antec 1100, but I wanted a small footprint for my case.of the old Antec 900 series and is slightly larger than the 300 for added cable management and has 4 holes to route the cables through and the back plane.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I haven't read any of King's work for many years, so I was interested in reading this when the Kindle edition was gifted to me. If this is any indication of his modern work he's really fallen off the horse, jumped the shark, etc...<br /><br />From the first pages I was a bit put off by his attempts to use teen slang, \\"homies, booya\\", and it just got worse from there.  After a few chapters it started to get a little bit more interesting, and just when the hook was finally sunk -- it just ends... and not just ends, but a completely incongruous ending at that!

I found this DVD searching for a Zumba video and decided to try it out given all the reviews.<br /><br />The first day I couldn't even finish level 1.  But my husband and I kept at it.  We didn't do every day (both of us were plauged with injuries..wear sneakers and use a mat!) but after a month I lost 13lbs and my husband lost 10.  We are both stronger, more toned, and have baggy clothes.  We have only done levels 1 and 2.  I just bought Ripped in 30 which is pretty similar to relieve boredom.<br /><br />I never thought I would do this, but I preach the gospel of Jillian.

It is a must read for any trial lawyer and the topic should be taught in law school as a requirement to understand what science now shows us about our traditional concepts of culpability.

B000TU16GS|2.0|The characters are all woefully underdeveloped, even the hero of the book.  The action scenes are passable, but the plot is sloppy.  Who decided to publish this amateurish attempt?  Here's hoping the author gets better as the books continue. Not that I will be reading them (to my kid).  Even for children, life's too short to read bad books; there are too many better ones to switch to.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Fifty Shades Freed is the third and final book in the Fifty Shades trilogy. I can say that with four stars, it was easily my least favorite of the three.<br /><br />What I loved about this book:<br />Ana was undoubtably a strong female character. I loved the growth that we saw out of her from the beginning of the series where she was, in my opinion, sort of wishy-washy. In the third book she was able to undoubtably stand up to Christian and fought to keep him and help him through his struggles. I loved that she fought back for what she wanted rather than simply giving in to him or running away.<br /><br />I also loved that this book had so much more action than the first two. Where the first two were more focused on Ana and Christian and their relationship, even though this one was as well, we still got a little bit of outside action, which made things a little more exciting.<br /><br />What I did not love about this book:<br />I didn't like the flashbacks in the beginning. I understand the reasoning for them, as without them the story would have had to drag on forever trying to cram all of that information in, but I felt they took something away from the story and I was left wanting a little more.<br /><br />Overall, I love, love, love this series and really would not have minded having another book, or two, of Christian.

I have enjoyed Suzanne Collins work, she has been able to create the future ever so convincingly. The Hunger Games was recomended to me by a classmate who is now a middle school english teacher.

That was an interesting twist that I really loved.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book and can't wait for the next book to continue their story!
B003EYVXV4|2.0|Loved the books.  I read the first one right before the first movie came out.  I know it sounds nuts, but I am very glad I went to see the movie, wouldn't have missed it.  Yet at the same time I was so disappointed in it.  I felt cheated.  I think the director and producers knew they were going to have this huge hit and make mega millions and yet chose to make the movie as cheaply as possible.  It seemed like a corporate decision to squeeze the last few cents of profit out of the franchise at the expense of the product.<br />I didn't like the shaky camera.  I didn't like the grainy film.  I didn't like the almost constant close ups, as if this film/world had no scope or sweep.  I hated the costumes which were so impressive in the book and so wrong in the movie.  What was up with that bad prom dress in Katniss's  last interview before returning to district 12.  The dress was supposed to make her look like an innocent young girl.  Instead she looked like an oompa loompa, with bad posture in a ballet tutu.  I hated the color balance of the picture.  It looked like a comic book with limited choice of colors. All these choices seemed to be wrong and not justified by idea of the book which was that the hunger games were these billion dollar spectaculars.  No expense was spared and the Capital had the capability of making almost anything happen.  At the same time Cinna, Katniss's stylist was a genius, but the costumes and hair styles he supposedly created and/or approved were so lame. He was, with the help of a crew, supposed to be able to manipulate and inspire a whole nation.  Yet the way Katniss was dressed and coiffed during the movie (and shot, BTW) did nothing to make her attractive.<br />The last thing I will say is that I think the movie was somewhat miscast.  It is a problem that could be overcome with the right director.  But they need a new director.

B0059XTUXQ|3.0|That Meryl Streep would be brilliant in her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher is a given and should be enough to justify a film's existence, but this sympathetic 2011 historical biopic does not give the actress enough to work with in what amounts to a charitable and cursory view of a controversial figure. Director Phyllida Lloyd had directed Streep in one of her lighter recent efforts, 2008's [[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia!]], where caricature and fleet footing worked together to keep the bouncy ABBA-penned score from touching ground. This time, however, a more definitive grounding would have been beneficial to provide Thatcher's story with much-needed perspective. Unfortunately, screenwriter Abi Morgan's ([[ASIN:B007FXLZ9K Shame]]) episodic patchwork of a script takes no sides in presenting the life and career of one of the most influential world leaders of the 20th century. Instead, amid moments of genuine poignancy, her story is tethered to the ravages of old age and the onset of dementia, presenting the still-living Thatcher as an almost Dickensian character dependent on the ghost of her eccentric late husband Denis for personal support.<br /><br />In fact, the film opens circa 2008 with Thatcher in a semi-senile state venturing out to buy milk at a local convenience store. Even though she is immersed in imaginary conversations with Denis, she is preparing to dispose of his clothes eight years after his death at the behest of her daughter Carol. After this lengthy introductory sequence, the story starts to traverse back and forth between extended flashbacks and her present-day solitude. We see her as the devoted daughter of a Grantham grocer, worshipful of her father but distant from her mother as Thatcher takes an interest in national politics starting at the lowest rungs of the Conservative party. From these early-day scenes, it's difficult to tell how or why she climbed to the top of the party because there is barely a glimmer of the ruthless ambition and savvy positioning that must have been Thatcher's forte to get ahead. Instead, we get the Cliff's Notes version that cuts to the high points of her career, so significant turning points come across as little more than a dramatic checklist.<br /><br />Running a blessedly brief 105 minutes, the film tackles in quick succession her Conservative stand at Parliament, her pointed challenge to Edward Heath for leadership of the party, her unfettered decision to send troops to defend the Falkland Islands, and her forced resignation in the face of hubris and waning popularity. Interspersed throughout is archival footage of the real Thatcher (with her face hidden, of course) during her twelve years as Prime Minister, the longest of any in the last century. Had Lloyd and Morgan reined in the breadth of Thatcher's life and zeroed in on a defining moment like the Falkland Islands war, the film would have been more dramatically effective in revealing the true figure. There is, however, no faulting Streep (with seamless assistance from her long-time make-up assistant J. Roy Helland) whose uncanny resemblance and authoritative performance commands attention most willingly. The surrounding cast barely has time to make any vivid impressions with the exceptions of Jim Broadbent's ([[ASIN:B000067J3R Iris]]) sprightly, familiar turn as Denis and Alexandra Roach's wide-eyed impersonation of the younger Margaret. Otherwise, the pacing feels off due to Justine Wright's choppy editing and Elliot Davis' overly artful camera angles. See it purely for Streep's artistry.itioning that must have been Thatcher's forte to get ahead.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's [[ASIN:B002S5N052 The Burning Plain]] (2008), Drake Doremus's [[ASIN:B004Z29XEI Like Crazy]] (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's [[ASIN:B003EYVXTG Winter's Bone]] (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the [[ASIN:B004LWZW42 X-Men: First Class]] in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in \\"Winter's Bone\\" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, \\"Survivor\\"-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two \\"tributes\\" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.<br /><br />This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' ([[ASIN:B00005JMCN Seabiscuit]]) surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray ([[ASIN:B0001907AI Shattered Glass]]); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district \\"tribute\\" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the \\"tributes\\", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to \\"American Idol\\". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.<br /><br />Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated [[ASIN:B005DNPKSQ The Truman Show]]. However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the \\"tributes\\" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the handheld camerawork by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson ([[ASIN:B003L20ICE The Kids Are All Right]]) doesn't makeas vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the \\"tributes\\", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like [[ASIN:B0027V6AL8 The Running Man]] and even ancient relics like [[ASIN:0780022114 The Most Dangerous Game]].

B0073XORCY|4.0|I am so sick and tired of people complaining that this isn't Tull, doesn't sound like Tull, should have been Tull, doesn't have Martin, doesn't sound like old Tull, blah blah blah yawn yawn yawn.  THIS IS NOT A JETHRO TULL ALBUM NOR IS IT BILLED AS SUCH.  If you have trouble reading, I feel sorry for you but get it through your head that this is a product of Ian Anderson and some current Tull members and some other musicians that he has worked with.  Seriously, people.  Now, on to the bad reviews.  Clearly, the 1-star and 2-star reviewers expected a sonic return to 1972 and when they didn't get it they started crying.  I don't know what to say to these folks except nobody cares that you're \\"disappointed.\\"  NOBODY.  As for the album itself, it is quite excellent.  Lovely songwriting and strong musicianship are the hallmarks of TAAB2, with some memorable hooks, choruses, and flourishes liberally sprinkled throughout.  The spoken passages work well with the songs to weave a clever narrative tapestry.  Ian's voice, contrary to the tiresome complaints to the contrary, sounds great especially for a 64 year old.  His skills as a flautist and songwriter are sharp as ever, rivaling his best work on SLOB and Rupi's Dance.  I don't know what more people expect from him (not that he gives a poop).  Pick up TAAB2 and while you may not be transported back to 1972, you will have an enjoyable listen to a masterful artist whose creativity is still marvelously intact.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun to play..addictive game I just want to keep playing.  I only find it hard to get friends to play and send me items I need
B007PTJOV0|5.0|&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; The return Mario, Lepario!!!  So much fun, brings back memories what else can l say.<br /><br />  A little jumpy with the kindle but still worth downloading it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I would recomend this program to anyone-this program runs great all of the time.  I really appreciate how accurate it is.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I totally love this game its fun easy bandits free.its the best game in the world!I love it!I really like the movie. theater part its cool. me and my little brother love that part!
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I've never cared for Rhianna in the past, but I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this album.  When I first heard \\"We Found Love\\" I didn't realize it was her.  My daughter downloaded the album from ITunes and I've heard all the songs and must admit that I love pretty much every song on the album and you don't find that much these days, usually just one or two songs are good and the rest are garbage.  With Rhinna's album there's something good and catchy about every song.  I really like the techno/house music beats and her singing sounds more natural than in the past.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun and entaining game. I'll play it when I'm super bored and it keeps me entertained for hours. this app also works amazingly on the kindle fire.
1451627289|5.0|I loved 11/22/63 right from the beginning and couldn't put my kindle down! Reading this book makes you question yourself \\"Would I go back in time to change history? and could I deal with the ramifications of that change?\\"  Everything happens for a reason and only God knows those reasons.  Our lives ebb and flow with every cause having an effect.  This book helps you to see that even in a tragedy, later down the road good may come from that tragedy.  We just never know.....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not exactly like Oregon trail but fun regardless. this game keeps me entertained and wanting to play more. could be more like the original. just saying.
0545128285|5.0|My daughter is a true Harry Potter aficionado, so this book was a must-add to her collection. The book is rather short, so any kid who has actually read all of the HP books will blow throw it in an afternoon. Still, I was happy to see how much she enjoyed it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game!!!!!!! I wasn't too sure if id like it but I love it. its addicting and a successful take on the classic
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you like puzzle dungeon games then this is the game for you.  puzzles start really easy and gets progressively harder at a slow rate.  fun and simple nice game
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very entertaining. Nice graphics. Relaxing but challenging at the same time. Nice for non &quot;gamers&quot;. Works well on my Toshiba tablet.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Beautifully done. The sound track (much of it sung by the actresses) is great. The sound effects and visuals are what I use to show off the Blu-Ray/Surround sound system now. The story was soso but I don't love it for the story. The fantasy scenes are great action. You have to watch them several times over to get it all.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Fun but I will not buy energy. It is a complete waste of money. The developers should have just charged for the game. Instead of buying energy I should get energy for every 10 food eaten by the player.
B0063IH60K|5.0|like traditional solitaire?  this is for you! one touch stacking makes it quick and easy. multiple game modes as well
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a good free game.  it is a little hard to play without friends adding your friends though.  give it a chance.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game!!! It's so cool. I never run out of energy that's the best part!!! my 3 yr old grandson loves the fishing game!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. It reminds me of Mario brothers and the controls are pretty decent also. Works well with the kindle fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very wonderful and simple-to-use tool for taking notes. Able to copy and paste from different applications, many even have a &quot;send to evermore&quot; option. I definitely recommend this app for the mom browsing for recipes on pinterest, as well as the businessman taking notes at a meeting!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|well I got the game then I tried to open it but it won...I could not open it it said I needed somekind of download to play the game I am not really loving this at all +I am mad! at least it was free
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i think this game is awesome.  i do wish that  energy wasn't so limiting.<br />  other than that found it to be very engaging.
0345803485|5.0|There was a lot of buzz about this book I had to see for myself & wow it sure is Addicting!
0938045695|5.0|Good book, as someone who hasnt really worked with kettlebells too much before, this book really helped me learn some of the ins and outs that I didnt know about before.  Some of the pictures were a little cheesy but in all, good information.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I either haven't been able to put this book down or wanted to throw it through a window.  Steve Jobs was the most brilliant of the brilliant, he was so inspirational and artistically creative and I don't think there is another person on this planet who was so clever and driven.  It is a tragic loss for the world that he left us so young.  On the other hand he was so cruel to those who loved and adored him, his children mainly.  His total lack of warmth and true love shows that he had dark problems that I believe he had no control over, that's just who he was.  I too believe that you can work with employees to inspire and motivate them to do better but Steve's nastiness was shameful and mean spirited.  There are those who hated him, loathed him but more that were driven to succeed so that's what really matters I suppose, in the big picture although I wonder if they relinquished their families for their jobs too.  I have learnt so much about Apple and the brilliance of everybody who worked there that I will, when I have to replace my computer go out and buy an Apple and will never have another computer.  Go Apple, keep fighting the fight, there are so many brilliant employees that the company can only reach the moon.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this is a fun game but it is to expensive it's 4.99 just for a game even if I was rich I wouldn't pay that much for a game.
B0037RDPEG|3.0|Loved the book, was frustrated by it at times as I am not a procrastinator and make quick decisions (sometimes not beneficial) to be honest.  I have never felt the need to take a similar journey but I can understand why she did, younger people do these things now.  Wouldn't it be fabulous if we could all drop everything and just go on a journey no matter when or where when we experienced a broken relationship and loss of a loved one, heartache or serious illness.  It's so sad to think that one has to take such huge steps to find themselves and their spirituality. My mum, who lived through WWII and the depression just sucked it up and did what she had to do to survive while my dad was at war. I would recommend it but to certain people, it's not for everybody.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This film did not disappoint with: excellent casting, great performances from the entire cast, a brilliantly original combination of unusual screen genres, great alien designs and execution using both computer effects and full size body prosthetics, beautiful on-site filming locations, a grand musical score, very convincing costuming, good set designs, and on and on.  Cowboys and Aliens payed due homage to the wonderful classic western and the best of sci-fi film traditions. Needless to say I loved Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, and found them both credible as rough cowboys with their own knight like sense of frontier fairness and compassion. I had been told that this film was not well received and that I should not go out of my way to see it.  I was badly misinformed and am supported by the majority of Amazon reviewers.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it very interactive lots of fun with good graphics runs a little slow at times but it is fun
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins literally has me holding my breath. Her characters become your best friends, and the plot is unbelievably unpredictable.
B0055SWM08|4.0|fun game to pickup for a couple minutes. only complaint is the repetitive midi music that plays. at least it gives the option to mute it
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  \\"Why Should I Worry\\" was a great Billy Joel song and Jenny was so kind to Oliver.  It SERIOUSLY TICKED ME OFF that Sykes not only threatened Fagin but also attempted to hold Jenny for ransom and his dobermans scared me when I was a child!  Georgette should have been kinder to Oliver and more disciplined and Rita is quite Georgette's opposite!  I thought that when Sykes was hit by the train, HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED!  The funny part of this movie is Tito's behavior and just so those of you who don't know do, he's played by the same guy who did the The Lion King's Banzai, Cheech Marin, a major comedian!  This movie has a great plot and great songs, I RECOMMEND IT!
B0034JKZ86|4.0|I got my daughter the Tiana doll for Christmas so I thought I would follow that up with the movie. The movies is great except for all the witch craft and demons, I think is a bit spooky for younger kids but the moral of the story and the singing are awesome!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app, because we live where our internet access has been limited and not consistent.  I love to do many crafts, but what I am working on now is \\"Loom Knitting\\".  It is so nice that I can download a new stitch or pattern instructions/demos and be able to watch them over & over until I understand it.  Plus I can download things to watch at a later time as well.  Works great on the Kindle Fire! So far I haven't had any problems...also downloaded a few video/songs that I liked and they worked great too.
0984536132|5.0|I had always wanted to read this book ever since high school, but as I have grown older and have a deeper understanding on how things work in the world it became important for me to read this book to understand a lot of Hitler's mind and thoughts were during his rise to power. This is a good read, sometimes a little hard to understand, but has historical value and for us that appreciate that kind of stuff- it is important.
B000IKQMFO|4.0|There's plenty of suspense and drama without any gratuitous violence.  It was difficult to understand the English accent at times, but the main points are repeated often enough that the gist of each situation is easy enough to surmise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The concept of this series is the romance of Anastasia and Christian with lots of yummy steamy twists. Anastasia college roommate asks her to interview  Multiple millions Christian for the college paper because the roommate is home sick. Anastasia and Christian connect for the very beginning but he is bossy, rich, older, sexual lifestyle that has playroom  and has LOTS of baggage.

B005VPRETE|1.0|I was disappointed with the condition of the box.  The toy looked like it was opened and returned.  It was ripped and a piece of the tape was missing from the box.  The condition of the package was unacceptable.  How could anyone send a package out in this condition.  I needed this toy for a birthday party that is tommorow and I am extremely upset because now I have to go out and shop for another toy for the little girl.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|it's. so wonderful to stay current in my walk with the lord throufh reading his word. I can read anytime which is very helpful. I like the layout of the plan too. it is just the right amount.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Who doesn't like The Big Bang Theory? You won't be disappointed. My kids got my husband and I to start watching this and now we're always quoting things from the show!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and the two that follow.  Struggled to put each of them down.  The author formed the characters very well, and I found the trilogy addictive.  Highly recommend!
0061119776|1.0|I used to be a fan of this \\"Story\\" when I was a child. I am glad to say that after reading this over again while holding an English degree, I will no longer be buying or reading the \\"Goodnight Moon\\" series, and I definitely never read the sequel \\"Good Morning Sun\\" There are many things wrong with this book. Goodnight lacks a proper subject and predicate agreement, which is needed for the early development of a kid. Without this book teaching him what a subject or a predicate is, who will? Not our teachers, that's for sure. In a recent study and survey done with CNN, teachers are opting to \\"completely obliterate\\" the need for teaching what a subject and predicate are, which rightfully should be taught by the books we read our children. The opinions in this book are just as cockamamie!I am never again reading my child something as idiotic as a unnameable person being told \\"Goodnight stars Goodnight air\\". The stars can not sleep (due to the fact they are just gaseous balls of elements)! The air cannot hear you talking-the air is what helps you talk! it has no way of hearing your message! My child, Moneer, called me up during his second-lunch and said \\"Father, why don't the stars ever say 'goodnight' back to me?\\" Know what I had to say? The stars aren't ever gonna say goodnight, Moneer. Most of them are actually dead. Just like your father when the time comes.\\" This book was also the reason why I had to tell my son about the world and the universe and where his dog actually went, instead of \\"the farm up at grandma Georgia's\\". For those who decided not to read my whole review, please take this out of the whole thing: This book is not worth the trouble it will start. Next time I'm just gonna have him watch \\"Pawn Stars\\".
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger Games, and the rest of the series for that mater, are page turners.  I was never bored and read all three books in a week. But that is the problem with the series.  The first book is very good, but after that it just gets darker and more depressing and by the end I was crying and felt like humanity should just be eradicated.  You certainly can't read the second book without reading the third, but if you could manage, I would say avoid it.  You will be a much happier person.  They are all well written, but be prepared to hate humanity and never feel the classic \\"happily ever after\\".  Sometimes the \\"happily ever after\\" is too cliched, but this all too realistic portrayal left me feeling empty and in tears.  The entire third book is just a downward spiral leading to a well wrapped up, but unsatisfyingly dark conclusion.<br /><br />If you want to read Hunger Games, but don't want to feel this way, stop after the first book, and use your imagination to fill in the rest.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This is a great game. It is quite a challenge and very addicting. It takes a lot of thought to complete the puzzles.  I recommend this to anyone that wants to be challenged.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Interesting city building game. the more you play, the more you get to play. Good way to kill time. It's fun and innovate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This games are fun and easy to play the offer hours of injoyment. classic game for all ages<br />they are great ton and a must have for anu one that injoys playing games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant at first about even reading this book.  I saw the movie and then had to read the book!  It is so much better than the movie.  very well written!!  Can't wait to start the next book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fantastic series!<br /><br />I avoided the science fiction/dystopian future genre for a number of years, because I was very disappointed in most of what I was finding. I felt like \\"Snow Crash\\" marked the peak of creativity in the genre. I've been on the lookout for something dark and inventive recently, though, and Wool just blew me away.<br /><br />The story is compelling and gripping. The characters are developed well and are easy to distinguish. Most of all, the plot is intelligent and realistic... and, it manages to not be at all predictable. I couldn't put this book down!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case does exactly what it promised to to do.  It is lightweight protective and sturdy.  I know my device is protected wherever I put it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is the best game I have got on my kindle fire so far it is awesome.  but I did just barely rate five stars because of the energy thing.  the energy is very annoying
B006MHWXMS|1.0|I like this app quite a bit. It's simple and straightforward, and the pro version syncs to the web. I was using the free version until my original Kindle Fire died and Amazon replaced it. I learned then that having a backup in the cloud is very handy.<br /><br />It also syncs to Calengoo, the app I use for my calendar on my KF. Calengoo syncs to my online Google calendar, so even when I had to restore my KF to factory defaults, I didn't lose anything.<br /><br />EDIT 11/19/12<br />This is STILL not available for the Fire HD. I have left feedback on the developer's website and have heard nothing. I used to use this app daily, but can't now. Rating reduced to 1 star for that.
B007BLCGNU|1.0|In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors in movies today. Yet, his skill is not able to overcome a poor movie.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like it but I knocked a star off because the shoot button is to close to the jump do when I try to jump I shoot and fall in the water.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|i don't know why people thought that this was not a grade one comedy.  i have seen lots of movies<br />and this was a great sequel.  every bit as good as the first film.  the first one was more of a<br />surprise.  i was expecting a lot and this one delivered.  i loved it.  perhaps because i have<br />been in bangcock.  but not really.  it was a great plotted and delivered film.  don't miss it.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love this, now I can take pics and upload them right away with my ipad. I can upload HD video and edit on the spot. A must have item

B0018QQQK8|4.0|Another wonderful story from Nicholas Sparks.His characters are so interesting and human.A really good read for a lazy summer day or bundled up before a fire on a cold day.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|wonderful game for all ages and constantly progressing I know love it and has become my favorite game on my tablet
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Yet another masterpiece from the \\"greatest rock band of all time\\". Yes all of albums are awesome but this one really is a work of art. The song writing of John and Paul reached its creative peak that would balloon in later albums, George starts to become rivited to the sitar, and Ringo has his first song contrubition (Although John and Paul wrote a good chunk). Anyway this is an album you must check out. Warning: Album is very, very addictive.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Terrific music! Lyrics are very timely and essentially tell a story. Instrumentals are classy! I admit to arriving late in my life to the Stringsteen fandom and now realize I have been shamefully unappreciative of his work. I highly recommend this CD.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A great game to wind down with. A relaxed pace that doesn't stress you out. Runs beautifully on Galaxy Nexus.

1569242739|1.0|This is a disaster of a book.  I made the vanilla cupcake recipe.  The first time I made them, they sunk.  I thought I might have added too much baking soda, so I gave them another try.  The second time, it looked like they sank, and then rose again.  I followed the directions precisely, to the letter.  I made them with all fresh ingredients.<br /><br />I'm going to try to return this to Amazon because it is so bad.  This tells me never to trust the reviews of the people on this site.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|A classic film! If you've never seen this movie it's one not to miss! Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton at their best.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is a great album all the way through. However towards the end of the opening song, Hold On, there is some distortion in the sound. Anyone else experience this? It happens with 2 different CD players, so it has to be the CD itself.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its just like super Mario brothers. My bother, sister, mom and I enjoy it. One of the best games on kindle fire: )
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Never had ever played wondering if its good is it? Thinking about buying it.? Nothing to really talk about please enjoy this elevator music. Do do do do do do do! Bye
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is very educational. It oz a great portable Bible. It talks about everything there is to know from the early te.stement to the last testement
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|was enjoying until the glitches that others have talked about. 105 hours to collect from all objects. appasrently the game creators could care less. if they don't care enough about the game to fix it; then its worthless.
B00080DIWE|5.0|The description is not clear, but this is actually two complete pivoting stands. Well designed with the modeler in mind. Very happy with the purchase.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i read these books with an open mind. The story line is not that great and very predictable yet i could not put my kindle down. Im not too muc into these kind of books but something about this book drew me in and i love. Im sitting wanting more, i wish i hadnt read the books so fast Cant wait for the movie!
B004KKX814|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3MSL3D2575H2H]]NO TAKARA TOMY  NO RUBBER  FAKE!!!!!
B005CMSDKA|1.0|Package arrived safely. Product was in very good condition. (That why its gets one star at least) However CAN NOT BE PLAYED because this product has what is called BD Live which requires that your Blue Ray player be connected to the internet in order for you to enjoy it. Silly really. I could understand if you wanted to access \\"special features\\" but to have to pay for an internet connection just to watch a movie really BITES
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|5 stars - this looks a lot like frontierville on facebook but it is a lot of fun to play. all ages
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome I love it you should get it my husband is mad right now cause we are in bed and instead of hanky panky I'm playing this.

B0055SWM08|5.0|no probe on the fire awesome game<br />. this game is challenging and it a great way to pas the time.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|I have wanted to read War Horse for a while, and following the film release, I knew now was the time.<br /><br />The story about a horse named Joey and his relationship with Albert is a wonderful story. Set against the backdrop of World War 1 and life on the Narracott farm and then at various locations through the war this story immediately brought me in and wouldn't let me put the book down until I had finished reading it.<br /><br />The descriptions that Morpurgo conveys in the book of the horses, the people and the war were easily imagined and you always knew if Joey was with the enemy or not. I love the fact that the book was told from Joey's point of view. It was really interesting to read what would have been the perspective of a horse in war.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone. The pages flow by and it leaves you with a sense of happiness in a very desolate time.<br /><br />I give War Horse 5/5 but I would have given more if I could.<br /><br />~*~
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it reminds me of Oregon trail but after you get there.  its a fun game so ill be playing for a while lol
B0073XORCY|4.0|The blah blah blah is for all the long winded excuses as to why this album is sooo good and for all the naysayers who don't get it anyway. Jethro Tull is my favorite band of all time. I said BAND, not Ian Anderson. And yes I love Under Wraps too! Of course I have been plucking up everything Ian has released on his own as well as Martin. Mostly because there has been nothing to come out with new material from Tull since Dot Com. This is  a REALLY good solo effort. May even be Ian,s best solo work yet. Well produced, well played, and of course, highly intelligent. Biggest problem for me IS the title. Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson Thick As A Brick 2. Just to use the moniker Jethro Tull infuriates me. If it is just an Anderson solo piece, then call it that! When you use the Tull moniker then you fully expect, as a fan, to hear the mighty Martin. There, I said it! And that,s it. Enjoy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its alot of fun and great for kids. my boys find it to be a lot like Mario the original.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoyed this game. it takes a while to build up points after the first two pages but still fun!

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote has been extremely useful. With it I can take my writing everywhere. I can keep notes on an idea that pops up when I'm away from the house. I can make grocery lists and record recipes. It's a great app!
B005COO1X6|2.0|When I got my Kindle recently, I started my search for books to fill it.  I thought a Stephen King novella written exclusivly as an eBook would be a good early purchase.  Wow, was I wrong!  I saw the mixed reviews but figured I'd give it a try anyway.  My mistake as much as King's, I guess.<br /><br />The problem here is that it's really the same scene told over and over again.  The characters change from scene to scene, but little else.  It's almost as if King was writing a scene for a novel, couldn't decide exactly what type of character would make that scene play well, wrote 3 or 4 test versions, then scrapped the longer story idea and decided to just throw together what he'd written (with a loose wrapper at the beginning and end) and call it a novella.  The writing is all King, and that gets it an extra star, but the story is almost non-existant because of its repetition.  I think he would've been better off picking one of the versions, wrap it a little tighter, and include it in a short story collection.
B0006J28BO|5.0|When I picked this up, I wanted it solely because I'd seen \\"Whisper Of The Heart\\" and while this isn't exactly a sequel to it, it is a sister story to it, and largely features the character of Baron, who was a cat statue used as the hero in WoTH heroine Shizuku's story. However, this movie focuses on shy Haru, who saves a cat one day when walking home.<br />She discovers that the cat she saved was the Prince of the Cat Kingdom. When the kingdom attempts to repay her with catnip and mice, they discover her unhappiness. When a messenger cat tells her that the Cat King would like her to become the wife of the prince, she panics, and a voice tells her what to look for. And then we come to our main characters. I won't go into the story, but I will say that you will love it!<br />The characters are great. Haru is easy to identify with. She's a shy awkward teenager, and seems very much like many teenagers would feel if they didn't fit in completely. Baron is one of those types that is easy to fall in love with, just because of the way he acts. Even though he's a cat figurine, it's impossible not to like. Even Haru admits that she may have a crush on him. Muta, another character that appeared in WotH, is very much the crusty complaining but loyal friend. The fat jokes do get old, but he's another likeable character, nonetheless.<br />Finally, the moral of the film. The moral is about knowing who you are. Haru's weak point is that she doesn't really know where she belongs and she doesn't have enough conviction in her decisions. The more time Haru spends in the Cat Kingdom, the more she forgets who she is and where she comes from...<br />Now watch the movie before I tell you everything that happens and every single line of dialogue!

1439190275|4.0|This book is not authored by Dr. Atkins himself. This book takes advanced scientific and nutritional knowledge into account and gives a healthier more balanced approach to the diet. Die-hards of the Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution (DANDR) will tell you that by following the plan detailed in this book you will lose more slowly than if you followed the original book authored by Dr. Atkins. That's probably true, but to me, this is easier to stick to, so even though I may lose a bit more slowly, I'm more likely to stay eating this way, so I will likely lose MORE weight!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I honestly loved the first two books in this series This last book however<br />Became quite redundant very fast! I get that they are neelyweds but seriously who has sex that<br />Often?  I mean they used sex to deal with all their issues.<br />I.E....\\"I told you not to go out and have drinks with Kate,  you were to stay home! (Heated argument ensues ....followed by make -up sex) .....Oh Mrs. GREY,  I LOVE YOU.....OH MY, ....WHOA...HOLY CRAP....I LOVE YOU TOO,  MR. GREY.....let's have vanilla sex. \\"<br />I found myself Rolling my own darn eyes at their dysfunctional relationship. I also found myself skipping pages to avoid reading the many similar sex scenes.  The ending of the book was a bit more palpable.<br /><br />If you read the first two books naturally you are going to want to read this one,  my advice to you is to proceed with lower expectations.<br /><br />\\"Holy Cow he's hot!\\" ;)

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Like so many others, I found that the Zoom just doesn't work.  I adjusted light sources, changed clothes, and went through every calibration... and still didn't work.  It was worth the gamble to see if we got one of the few good ones (we didn't order through Amazon; we bought it locally on a whim).<br /><br />For all reference, my Kinect is at maximum height suggested by the Kinect specs.  It works fine without the Zoom (except for having an issue seeing all of the floor, which is a result of basic geometry).

1401937519|5.0|Wow! I've read many spiritual books and many, many books about Near Death Experiences.  But this book is something very special.<br /><br />I caught the last five minutes of a Wayne Dyer interview on the radio one day.  He was talking about this woman and how her story had changed his life.  The passion in his voice grabbed my attention so I decided to look the book up on Amazon.  After seeing the reviews, I ordered it right away.<br /><br />As far as her NDE goes, it's not the most dramatic account I've ever read.  There was a moment when I was thinking, \\"This is it?\\" But stick with it because the really amazing part comes from her healing (obviously), but not only that. It's from what she has to say about illness in general, and also about how we're intended to live our lives here, what this human experience is all about.<br /><br />This book really resonated with me.  I feel like it shifted my thinking. I'm not currently ill, but I realized that my thinking was \\"off.\\" In particular, I realized that, although I consider myself a compassionate person, my compassion has mostly been directed outward toward others. This book helped me see that I need to love myself and show the same level of kindness toward the divine spark in myself. That I need to stop beating myself up over things I can't control --like other people's perceptions-- and that I need to allow myself to just be who I am, the person God created.<br /><br />Every once in a while you find the exact book you need at the exact time you need it.  That's what this book is for me.
0741470314|5.0|Until I read Dr. Karen Moriarty's book about Michael Jackson, I was a \\"distant fan\\" who enjoyed his music and his dancing and felt that he was a victim of unwarranted media shark attacks, but I didn't truly know the depth of the man.  Dr. Moriarty made him come passionately alive for me in her book and I am grateful that she took the time and made the effort to research his life story and defend him so eloquently.  He was, indeed, a compassionate, talented and generous King among men.  Anyone who has any doubts about that should simply read this book!
B0067Q04AM|5.0|This CD is REAL MUSIC. This is a great R&B,Jazz,Rock and Neo Soul ensemble piece. Many of my favorite current underground divas take part on this one. Lalah Hathaway's take of Sade's \\"Cherish The Day\\" is fierce (for lack of a better word). I have played it repeatedly on my commute to work. The every changing and crazy Erykah Badu delivers an awesome \\"Afro Blues\\". She does slow grooves best. Stay there crazy Badu and just maybe you'll become what you think you are. (TRUTH) I am having fun with this one y'all. For real, I do truly enjoy this mesh of music. MUSIC MUSIC finally MUSIC! It is really music in 2012! 'bout &*^%#! TIME! This year has been pitiful. The US releases are WEAK and very BAD. \\"Nicky Menage-A-Trois\\" is BS! I won't go on. GD! Today's no-talent required,just be cute (and slutty) on camera music scene is awful! Shame on the major labels (so few US owned anymore). Nearly all I have seen and heard of late is BS!

The Adventure starts inside a wardrobe. Inside the wardrobe is a big country named Narnia.<br /><br />I think this book was written for kids of ages 10 and up who like fairy tales and adventures. This book voice is written in 2nd person but the characters conversation it is in 1st person.<br />I think that people who like adventure will like this book and kids that are fairy tales lovers will also like it.

B004CIIXC8|4.0|Independent films have gotten less......independent over the years. The casts and budgets have gotten more expensive making them more like Hollywood versions of heir distant cousins. Not the case here.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Mia lives in some low rent housing with no father and a mother who won't grow up. She has a little sister but the two don't communicate on any meaningful level. Mom gets a new boyfriend who seems really cool and might be someone who might help her break the chain. No such luck.<br /><br />Kate Jarvis plays Mia. She's 15 years old. Doesn't attend school and only seems to care about dancing, which she does mostly to the accompaniment of gangster rap. She's mean to people. Swears a lot. Drinks and generally gets into trouble. But she can't abide cruelty to animals. She feels trapped. Mom's new guy is fun but he also eggs her on to excel. Gets her to try dancing to other kinds of music. He gets the whole family out to the country where he teaches her to fish with her hands. He seems to genuinely care for her and can be good for her. She sees the possibilities. It all comes crashing down when certain things come to light. But whatever happens, she's getting out.<br /><br />This is real indy stuff. A lot of hand held camera and natural lighting. Jarvis does a great job as Mia. You see how she gets to realize that where she's at is nowhere, but there has only been a glimpse of a beacon (in mom's boyfriend) as to where she can go. Michael Fassbender, the only name I recognized, does a great job as the boyfriend. He seems, at first, like a decent sort. It hurts when you see his true colors. The music is mostly Gangster Rap and Hip-Hop. Good attention is paid to location. It's shot in such a way as to show the world happening around her. It's a world she's not part of.<br /><br />This is pretty hard edged stuff. It's not a \\"Juno\\" kind of flick. It's much tougher than that, filled with people who live outside society. If you're at all into this sortof thing this is about as good as it gets.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Definitely a fun free update to a classic game.  The energy DOES recover when your not playing but does run out quick when playing.  Still a fun waste of 10 to 15 minutes at a time.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Kind of interesting take on a art-house/ 80's action hybrid.  The plot is kinda campy and silly, but I think that was the point in some respects - the movie's more about characters, style and atmospherics than it's about story development. That said, I enjoyed it for what it was.<br /><br />In any case, here is the kind of the dialogue to expect from \\"Drive\\":<br /><br />Driver:......<br /><br />Irene:......<br /><br />Driver: Wanna... Maybe go for a drive sometimes?<br /><br />Irene:......<br /><br />Driver:......<br /><br />Irene:......<br /><br />Driver:......<br /><br />Irene:......[Smiles]<br /><br />Driver:......<br /><br />[Driver beats bad guy to death with a hammer.]<br /><br />Bad Guy: Oooouch.<br /><br />Driver:......[Smiles]<br /><br />Irene:.....

0345803485|1.0|I am sad to say that I bought into all the hype and purchased this horrible book. This book is about a man who gets off on hurting the women in his life through sick sexual relationships. I am dumbfounded by the reviews that call this a love story. This is a horror story!! Grey needs professional help. Ana the woman involved is a sad case of a woman confusing love with manipulation and physical abuse. I am troubled that the \\"sample\\" of this book does not give the reader a accurate view of this book. This book is full of nasty language and sick situations. Please do not waste your time or money on this trash.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I'm a fan if this app. I use it on my cell now I use it on my Kindle fire.

1905113153|5.0|David Spence's authoritative royal icing book is beautiful!  It is a big, hardbound book filled with beautiful photographs of royal icing work, and detailed instructions.  Note that recipe amounts are metric, not what we're used to in America, and that there are a few British words for items that are not common to U.S. audiences.  (But, they're not hard to figure out.) And there are plenty of places on-line to get the metric conversions. Also, the book seemed a little pricey to me; until I received it.  Then I realized it was worth every penny.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in taking their RI decorating to the next level.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Can calming and challenging be adjectives describing the same game? The answer is yes and that game is Quell. The game is enhanced with soothing music and beautiful graphics, and there are no time limits or losses to change your focus or add any element of stress. The premise is simple but the play is thought provoking. There do not seem to be enough levels to enjoy changing boards for the length of time I would prefer as I am already half way through...but am unsure if it ends or unlocks more puzzles. Great app and truly worth the dollar!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game with nice atmosphere with cool graphics and relaxing music. Looking forward to having more levels added in the game.
0062011847|5.0|I am not yet through reading this latest installment of Discworld, but I can report it is worthy of inclusion into the multitude of stories that Terry Pratchett has created for the world.

B000HIVOI2|3.0|I haven't seen this movie in a long time.  It's hard to believe it's coming up on being 20 years old, but when I think about it, the last time I saw it, it was during a weekend where we had free HBO or Showtime or something for the week and it was one of the newer movies being featured.  So  yeah, been a while.  However, I do like Sci-Fi and I found the Extended Cut Blu Ray for a whopping five bucks at Target and couldn't resist.<br /><br />Being so long, I didn't remember the particulars of the movie very well, so it was almost like seeing it for the first time.  It's a movie that takes the idea that the Egyptians weren't worshipping gods after all, but a race of space aliens that were using them as slave labor.  Eventually, the humans became too strong and the aliens, led by Ra, took off; but not before leaving an artifact to be found thousands of years later.  That would be the Stargate, of course.  Which opens a portal through space to distant galaxies.  After recruiting a young floppy haired James Spader to help them unravel the mystery of the Stargate, a team is led by Kurt Russell (at his square jawed, high and tight haircut early 90s toughest) through the Gate to find out what's on the other side.  What they find is a race not unlike the early Egyptians, being used by Ra and his forces as slave labor once again.<br /><br />I love the idea behind this movie.  The execution of that idea is good, but I think could have been a lot better.  As it is, it's an entertaining piece of sci-fi with a decent archeological mystery and action that moves along nicely and hits all the notes it's required to.  It just seems as though they didn't reach the potential that the set-up of the movie promised.  The story is of the classic mold of a group of soldiers teaming up with a primitive race to fend off their technologically superior evil overlords set in a sci-fi mold.  For the time period, the special effects are very good and I actually think they hold up pretty well.  I actually didn't think there was as much FX as you would expect in a movie like this, which isn't really a bad thing.<br /><br />In a movie like this, there are leaps of logic that must be made to make the story work and it's a credit to the movie that I took those leaps without much grumbling.  The one thing the movie asked me to do, though, that I simply could not was to take French Stewart seriously as a hard nosed soldier.  Couldn't do it.  Sorry.  Hearing tough guy snarky dialog coming from the Squinty Eyed One was just one leap too many.  Also, Hollywood once again doesn't disappoint with it's obvious love affair with the name Jack.  In this movie, we have Russell's character named Jack and Spader's last name Jackson.  Subtle, Hollywood, subtle.<br /><br />Those quibbles aside, it really is an entertaining movie with Spader doing good with the role type that would be taken over by Jeff Goldblum in Emmerich/Devlin's \\"Independence Day\\", and I really liked Kurt Russell as Jack O'Neil.  You wanted to like him, because Kurt Russell is just so darn awesome, but he was a character with flaws and layers and maybe he didn't have the best of intentions, but Kurt was good at giving you windows of the sympathetic side of O'Neil.  As with others, I can't speak highly enough of David Arnold's score.  I miss big scores in movies with recognizable themes.  This might be one of the best movie scores ever, if only for the main theme.  I loved it.  Basically, what we're dealing with here is just a fun action/sci-fi flick that asks you to go along for the ride and have a good time with it, and I enjoyed it for that.  It's just a shame that I felt it could have been so much more.<br /><br />The blu-ray side of things, though... that's another story.  I got it cheap, so I can't complain too much.  The movie just doesn't pop like other blu-ray releases do.  I can't compare it to the DVD release, as I never saw it, so I don't know how much of an upgrade it is, but the picture just doesn't blow me away.  The menu is kind of awkward.  When I go to, say, scene select, the disc does this weird pause thing that briefly takes you back to the main menu screen as it resets the background music before sending you back to the screen select menu.  Weird.  Also, I didn't realize until after I was done that you had to have subtitles on to see the subtitles when the aliens were talking.  I went through the movie thinking that was maybe just a stylistic choice by the filmmakers, yet still felt like I was missing some plot.  Now I know why.<br /><br />Still, for the price I paid for it, I don't regret the purchase.  It's a bit of a questionable blu-ray, but it's a fun enough movie that its worth owning.  I say 3 stars with the shoddy blu-ray issues, 3.5 stars for the flick.
030758836X|4.0|Nick and Amy Dunne were once the perfect couple.  He was a writer at a magazine.  She wrote quizzes for magazines, the sort that gauge one's personality type.  Then they were both laid off, her parents' series of \\"Amazing Amy\\" books (based on their daughter, an only child) began failing, and his mother fell ill.  So they moved from New York to North Carthage, Missouri, near his hometown of Hannibal, and with his wife's remaining money and his twin sister Margo, Nick opened a bar.<br /><br />It is the morning of Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary, but all is not well.  Amy is unhappy about having moved from New York and her diary entries reflect her dissatisfaction with her life.  On that morning, Amy disappears, and Nick descends into a whirlwind of lies and puzzling behavior.  Where is she?  Why was the scene at his home staged?  Is he a killer?<br /><br />The story of her disappearance and Nick trying to convince the public he's not a killer takes up the first third or so of the book.  The rest, well, I can't really talk about lest I give away some spoilers.  I can only say that not everything is as it seems, and the book has more twists than any I have read.  It also has some of the least likable characters I've ever encountered in fiction.<br /><br />Still, the book held me, and I look forward to reading more of Gillian Flynn's books.<br /><br />I will say that none of these characters are particularly likable.
0061146307|4.0|My 9-year-old daughter wanted to read these books after hearing that a friend in her class liked them. I read this first one with her (she read some to me, I read some to her, etc.). I found the story to be somewhat engaging--which is to say it kept me reading. I was somewhat horrified by the Marvelous Marriage situation, which seemed not to bother my daughter. She found the book ALOT funnier than I did. As an adult, I agree that the word definitions are repetitive and unnecessary even for kids. None of this is big news.<br /><br />There were a couple of things in the book, though, that caught my eye. First, while the children are somewhat helpless and not \\"heroes\\" as some other reivewers said--most children are not heroes. On the other hand, they did work hard, use books to comfort themselves as a figurative escape from a bad situation, attempt to engage adults to help them, look out for each other, and use their ingenuity. Not every kid is a wizard like Harry Potter - but then maybe they don't need to be.<br /><br />The other thing that caught my attention was my daughter's comment about identifying with the characters when the narrator said something about \\"anyone who has lost someone close to them.\\" Well, my mom died rather suddenly a little over a year ago, and my dad is now in the final stages of cancer. Not easy situations for adults to cope with, never mind a child. It occurs to me that in our nice suburban area, most of her friends have likely not experienced much loss or pain yet at this age, and probably very few of them have experienced hospice care for a loved one.<br /><br />So while my initial gut feeling was to ask her not to read any more of the series, on fuller consideration, I suspect that they may be helping her to grieve for sadnesses in her own life. Maybe more than she knows, because if you ask her why she likes the book, she says, \\"It's funny.\\" As long as she is entertained by the book and has parents who love her and care for her, it probably is a good thing for her to know that there are other people who have experienced pain and sadness as well. Not to mention seeing people dealing with it and moving on with their lives, even without magical powers.

0439023483|5.0|Suzanne Collins hits a high mark in fiction with \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy. One must read the entire series, not just a single book, to fully appreciate the thought and care that went into character development, storytelling, structure and themes. Collins writes in a lean, clear voice that suits her hardscrabble sixteen-year-old narrator and never bogs down the fast-moving plot or blunts the books' emotional impact. I can think of few books in any genre, for any target age group, that are this well-written. If anything, \\"The Hunger Games\\" calls to mind Shirley Jackson. Sorry, Ms. Rowling, enjoyable as the Harry Potter books were, Suzanne Collins writes circles around you. The acknowledgments at the end of \\"Mockingjay\\" suggest that Collins had able editorial support, which I think Harry Potter's publishers abandoned after \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" in their frenzy to get product on the shelves.<br /><br />By now everyone has heard enough about the subject matter that it would be a waste of time to go over it again. I will say I dodged reading \\"The Hunger Games\\" for a long time, thinking I had had enough of dystopian fiction, enough of teenagers, and enough of pop-culture frenzy phenomena. I only gave in on the advice of a friend who seldom cares to read novels and could not put the books down. I could not put them down either.<br /><br />Note for parents: Although most children age nine and up should be able to handle the vocabulary without help, due to the dark, thought-provoking content, I suggest reading along with any child under 13 or perhaps reading the books yourself first before you decide whether to let your child read them.<br /><br />To address a few criticisms I have seen: (1) I don't really care whether Collins borrowed ideas from Japan's \\"Battle Royale\\" book and movie (she claims she did not); \\"The Hunger Games\\" stands as its own work of art. (2) While writing in the present tense can seem gimmicky and annoying, Collins uses it effectively to make \\"The Hunger Games\\" visceral and intellectually and emotionally authentic. (3) Whether you like the end of Mockingjay will be a matter of taste; I thought it was perfectly suited to what preceded it.<br /><br />Bravo, well done.

B0053JJLLC|4.0|I've been a Michael Crichton fan for a while now. I was saddened when he died in 2008, and shocked when I read the seemingly unfinished Pirate Latitudes. It was still good..but lacked much of the Crichton flare. I feared the same when I began to read his newest novel, Micro. And I can say that I had fun the whole way through the 400 page novel courtesy of Crichton's and Richard Preston's adventurous spirit.<br /><br />The novel is drenched in research and detail. Whether this was Crichton or Preston is not clear. However, the novel reads like a fun adventure which it most certainly is supposed to be.<br /><br />I understand why this novel has gotten many bad reviews. I do. The characters are somewhat cardboard, their motives are not very imaginative. However, it is the circumstances that the authors put us, the readers, into that truly makes the novel work, in my opinion.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading this. I know, I know. Leave the stuff he wasn't finished with alone. But for me, the nostalgia and satisfaction of grabbing a new Michael Crichton novel off of the shelf is enough. The great story, though sometimes uneven, truly is a lot of fun. Drop your preconceived notions of hatred for Harper-Collins. Drop your contempt for Richard Preston finishing Crichton's work. Just jump into the world of Micro and have a little fun.

B0074EIQQU|5.0|Someone once accurately described The Mars Volta as being like Led Zeppelin if Zep were a prog rock band being blasted through the rings of Saturn. The Mars Volta's new release Noctourniquet changes space gears by introducing more synths and atmosphere while still creating epic soundscapes. There are actual song structures with repeating melodies that are in contrast to the sprawling early work of the band. It works brilliantly and Noctourniquet joins Deloused... and Francis as a masterwork.<br /><br />Omar Rodriguez Lopez' guitar is utilized less here but still roars into action like a 747 hitting the runway from time to time. The gifted musician also shows a subtle gentle picking style throughout that adds a bit of ethereal beauty to their muscular and aggresive sound.<br /><br />Singer/lyricist Cedric Bixler Zavala has produced his most melodic vocals to date. The sound and songs are more restrained and conventional (almost pop sounding...not necessarily a bad thing!) The band's layered framing of the vocals still push the progressive elements of the music forward.<br /><br />In the past, TMV introduced wonderful and unexpected bits of music and melody, teasing the listener into wanting more. Here, Zavala will repeat melodies (there are actual choruses!) and give the listener what they want. The danger: too many expected sounds will water down the exciting and surprising elements of the band's music...kind've like having a cake for dinner (enjoyable at first, sickening later.)<br />TMV avoid this trap by creating some of the most mind blowing soundscapes ever recorded. Parts of Empty Vessels make the Loudest Sounds make the listener feel like they've been transported into universal sized honey/hive with bees swarming the senses. In Abentia's synths stream like a fire hose of color to the minds eye.<br /><br />Long time fans will appreciate traditional sounding (if there is such a thing) TMV songs like Molochwalker and Zed and Two Naughts (ZOO.) Theses songs skid and burn though guitar based chaos. For me, unfortunately, it's a been there, done that feeling for these songs (I own every album.) I prefer the newer kaleidoscope of sounds on Vedamalady and the title track, Noctourniquet. Either way, with a good sound system and a pair of headphones, the listener should buckle up for take off...and burn though guitar based chaos.

0345803485|1.0|As an avid reader, I appreciate a well-written novel, no matter the genre. Basic grammar and punctuation. A coherent story arc. Writing ability. A chapter into 50 Shades, and my eyes crossed. Within four chapters, I hated myself for reading. I forced myself to finish in the hopes that it might have some redeeming value. Alas, no. I'm pretty sure I lost IQ points during the process.<br /><br />I've got nothing new to say that hasn't been said a million times: the characterizations are badly done; it's thoroughly unbelievable that Ana is a] a virgin and b] does not own a computer or cell phone (unless perhaps she's grown up in a commune or one of those bizarre religious cults); the writer knows nothing about American geography or language; the repetition is irritating; the writing is juvenile. On and on...<br /><br />The truly shocking thing to me that anyone believes this is actual BDSM or that the sex is in any way hot. This novel is insulting to the BDSM community--everyone involved in the lifestyle in this novel is mentally deranged, a pedophile, or was abused as a child. It's a thing to be cured, not celebrated or enjoyed. There's no talk of subspace or aftercare, etc. And the sex? Really? It's so badly written it's hard not to giggle through it...and not because it's dirty but because it lulz-worthy. It may be the least sex-positive smut novel I have ever had the displeasure of reading.<br /><br />I can see perhaps loving this novel is you rarely read. It's sort of like erotica with training wheels...or maybe a slightly spicy Sesame Street for people with boring and unimaginative sex lives. Perhaps it's for people who never realized there's an entire genre of really *good* erotica waiting for them or people who think The Jersey Shore is scintillating entertainment. I've seen reviews taking readers to task for daring to nitpick the horrible writing, the atrocious technical skills of the writer, etc, but that just makes me sad--does no one care about the actual writing quality?<br /><br />Of course, it makes me sadder that Vintage picked this up to publish. Yes, publishing is a business...but it definitely damages the once-fantastic Vintage brand. The standards have definitely been lowered. Mediocrity should not be championed.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|As a fan of anime from the 1990's, I have been a little frustrated lately with some of the more recent anime films which seem to lack a certain something.  I ended up watching this film initially based on the knowledge that the director of it was also the director for \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\\" (Mamoru Hosoda).  I found myself liking how the film does an interesting thing, it presents characters in two different environments, their digital avatars and their physical selves, often the digital avatars displaying aspects of the characters that may not come out in real life.  Visually the film is simply astounding, I enjoyed the incredible amount of energy and creativity the the film presented, the artwork is simply beautiful on its own right.  Finally, the film does something else, it has a heart to it, the plot, the characters, everything works together to create a genuine reaction in you (or it did for me and a few others whom I've spoken to about the film).  I really have no difficulty in recommending this to anyone looking for something a little different that is fresh.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Exceptional visuals<br />* Great characters and story<br /><br />Cons:<br />* I wish this was a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo pack, as I have the DVD version, but would have liked to have had the Blu-Ray version with it.

This clock is a simple device that helps me know what time it is where they are, so I don't try to call anyone while they are sleeping. (When I was young, my mother always called me from India when it was 3 a.m. my time. Her excuse: she knew I was home then.) I much prefer being able to check this clock on my [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] than having to do the math or turn on a computer and search for a time zone clock.

B004UID2LC|5.0|I was very cautious of this ap due to some of the reviews and really didn't think it would work.  Its GREAT!  I downloaded a few songs and spent half the day yesterday watching random vids.  Its so much faster and easier than watching vids elsewhere.  I am using a Galaxy Tab with wifi.  This ap wont increase your memory or better your internet connection so keep that in mind.  I've not had any random popups or actually anything from this ap.  You have tap your menu button to get the search bar and tap and hold a vid to get a popup menu to choose what to do with it in case anyones having trouble

B00792EGES|4.0|I've been a massive AB fan since the first album, the Amsterdam show is still one of my favourite live DVD's however I was slightly underwhelmed this time around.<br /><br />The production level here is great, in HD format it's a visual treat.  Myles is one the best vocalists around at the minute, however this performance didn't stand out for me whether this was down to the mix on the night, or a rigorous tour schedule  I don't know.  But for me, the Amsterdam show was vocally more impressive.<br /><br />I also would have liked to hear a slightly different set list, Fallout, One by one, break me down, Still remains, Make it right would have fit straight in.  Some people have also commented on the language?!?.... deal with it, this is rock and roll people!<br /><br />So in summary... Good product... Does this change my opinion of the band, no, does this mean you shouldn't by this DVD, Hell no! Great band, but an ok performance... But for all die hard AB fans, this should see you through the hiatus until the Next AB project. Enjoy

B000002J1S|5.0|Wow, where to begin on this one!  There's a lot of stuff to cover.  This is clearly Genesis's most ambitious effort and a must have classic of 70's prog rock.  It;s a \\"concept\\" album that runs 1-1/2 hours, and as is usually the case with these, it has its flaws.  Still overall it's a great album and deserves all five stars.<br /><br />The album was originally released on two LP's, which is how I initially bought it. the first 3 of 4 \\"sides\\" of the album are top notch, while the last 1/4 is weaker and often sounds like fill.  the \\"concept\\" is based on a long and convoluted surrealist story written by Peter Gabriel, which is printed in the liner notes. It's a story that defies clear interpretation even 30+ years after I first got the album.  This is the last album Gabriel recorded with the band.  While previous albums were more collaborative writing efforts, for this one Gabriel wrote the lyrics, then ran off to work on a movie project (never completed), while the other members wrote the music.<br /><br />I won't go through all the songs, but certainly there are a lot of songs that have become favorites of Genesis fans.  The title track and \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" have become concert favorites which the band performed for years afterwards.  \\"Broadway Melody of 1974\\" mixes images of cultural icons into a surrealistic parade of images.  \\"Back in NYC\\" is another highlight.  With different instrumentation this song could easily have fit in with Peter Gabriel's second album.  In fact Gabriel performed this song live for the first couple of years.  If Peter Hammill's \\"Nadir's Big Chance\\" was proto-punk, then this song, if not in the instrumentation, then certainly in the lyrics and vocal delivery certainly exudes a certain punk attitude.  \\"Counting Out Time\\" is a poppish tune that is in the tradition of their humorous songs like \\"Harold the Barrel\\", etc.<br /><br />The sound of this album is quite different from the previous ones. There are more experimental sound textures involved.  Brian Eno is listed in the credits as contributing \\"Enossification\\", which I assume means his characteristic tape loops and sound treatments.  Unlike the albums before it, there are actually very few extended instrumental passages.  The longest one is the mostly atonal \\"Waiting Room\\", which almost reminds me a of a Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd freakout.  Another instrumental is titled \\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\\", which is strangely similar to the title of their UK label mate Peter Hammill's 1974 album \\"Silent Corner and the Empty Stage\\".  Dunno if it means anything, but it's odd.<br /><br />One complaint I have is that guitarist Steve Hackett is given short shrift.  This tendency contributed to his departure in 1977.  The 3rd \\"side\\" of the album contains the majority of his contributions, which are great.  In particular the brief solo at the end of \\"The Lamia\\" is a simple but melodic and wonderfully atmospheric ending for the song. Genesis, unlike other bands lumped into the prog pidgeon hole, did not focus on flashy instrumental chops.  What distinguished them is their creativity, musicality and their ability to create wonderful soundscapes.  Additionally, Peter Gabriel's vocals and lytical turns of phrase are in top form, even if the story line is totally convoluted.<br /><br />As i mentioned, the last bit of the album, after \\"The Lamia\\" is weaker, and a lot of it, like \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\\" seems like filler.  The sound of that last part also does sound rather dreary to be honest.  Then suddenly for the finale the album shifts gears to the uptempo \\"It\\", with Gabriel throwing out obtuse silly phrases like \\"It is chicken / it is eggs / it is in between your legs\\", and what I interpret as a jab at critics - \\"if you think that it's pretentious / you've been taken for a ride\\".<br /><br />This may or may not be Genesis's best album.  i make no bones about being very biased towards the Gabriel era material.  I think all albums between \\"Nursery Cryme\\" and this one are cruical.  Perhaps if you want to start with one, you might go for the previous one, \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" (see my review), but you will want to dive into this one eventually.  This is an album that definitely takes some time to digest, but it's well worth the effort.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002J1O Selling England By the Pound]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002J1M Foxtrot]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002J1L Nursery Cryme]][[ASIN:B000002NZO Trespass]]<br />[[ASIN:B000007RU1 Genesis Archive, Vol. 1: 1967-1975]]<br />[[ASIN:B000002J1Q Genesis Live [Definitive Edition Remaster]]]nd this one are cruical.

B00756GKBA|3.0|I have been a Madonna fan for over twenty years. I've been to a lot of her shows which I have to say are phenomenal.  However, this new cd is not her best. There are a few songs that really get my attention and others fall flat. I really like \\"Turn up the radio\\" and \\"I'm a sinner\\"! I suppose that since she is now close to her mid-50s, I'm sure that it's getting harder to come up with new material.  I don't dislike this cd but it could have been better!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is entertaining; but it also gets \\"all up in your business\\" because it teaches life lessons in a way that is authentic. It is not afraid to look at real human emotion and how we are flawed and when we hurting we often do the wrong thing. In the movie we learn that if we can just recognize the truth that we need redemption in our mess and accept the help that is offered then we are on the way to healing.<br /><br />As usual with movies from this producer, just about the time the content gets too heavy, there are little moments of spunky humor thrown in to balance things out, and make you want more.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|This movie has an art-house feel to it, and i suspect that most of the people who didn't like it, expected a type of Gone in 60 seconds film. This is true film making at its best, just read the critics reviews on rottentomatoes.com. I thought it was just bloody brilliant, though it must be said this film bears repeated viewing before its excellence can be appreciated.

I play this on the kindle and there's no easy way to see the home/volume/etc options so I would have to turn my kindle screen of and on until it would ask me to force close it. NOW at level 27, my potatoes that should take two hours are going to take 155 hours and a bunch of other glitches. It's so frustrating to get anywhere in this game and there's no customer service to notify them of the problem.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun. It would be nice if it was made  easier to unlock games. Its hard to unlock some of the higher games without paying for extra coins not to cool. The games I have unlocked are fun. however I think this game was worth it.
0385751532|4.0|** spoiler alert ** The boy in the Striped Pajamas<br /><br />reviewed by: Issy Hamilton<br /><br />When Bruno returns home from school one day, he discovers that his belongings are being packed in crates. His father has recieved a promotion and the family must move to a new house. His life was prefect, until he had to leave all his friends behind for a lonely town far away. Bruno is the sort of boy that loves to explore and discover new things, so it was the prefect opportunity when his mother was out and he could sneak into the forbidden door round the back of the house. with his short brown hair and his brown shorts flying in the wind, Bruno soon discovered something very strange. He had found a tall fence running alongside, stretching as far as the eye could see, which cuts him off from the strange bald men dressed in striped pajamas, working behind the fence. Along the way Bruno meets a small boy on the other side of the fence called Shmuel. His father explains to Bruno how the people behind the fence are the enemies, however Bruno does not want it to come between them. Shmuel begins to tell Brunno about his life and how it is so different. Their meetings each day result in a friendship that has devastating consequences.<br /><br />The book was amazing! I think it is the best book I have read so far in my life. As soon as I picked it up you would not see it out of my hands. I would recommend this book because the story line is based on a true event that took place in 1942. The fences were called concentration camps that took jews in like Shmuel, the event that took place was called the Holocaust. The story really gets different emotions running through you. the genre of this book is fiction. I think this book is best for ages 11 and up. Finally I would rate this book 9.5/10.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is the first of two parts of the last two films. The special effects are impressive and the acting is right on the mark. Especially well-played is the part played by Helena Bonham Carter as she plays the demented and crazy wizard Bellatrix Lestrange. As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film. Still and all a quite good film that I can gladly recommend. 4/5.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) is the second a final part of the seventh Harry Potter film. It is a macabre and terrifying film that should be seen with an adult as children even at the age of 11 can find some of the scenes to be a bit frightening. The special effects are amazing and Radcliffe, Grint and Watson play their parts to perfection. It sticks much closer to the book then many of the prior sequells and at times one wishes that the other movies had also been made into two parts. At 130 minutes it is a little rushed at a few spots and I am waiting for an extended version to be released. Even so I definitely recommend this film. A strong 4 out of 5. 4/5.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I can't go down the well on scene 6 even though I have the rope.  Is there a glitches in the game? It is a pretty interesting game but I would love to finish it! Help
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it. lil like Mario. but there ain't nothing wrong with a classic with a twist. hope it catches on
B0073U2FB2|1.0|AWFUL the best thing about this movie is the trailer and the movie cover, the actors are awful story disjointed they probably left all the good parts on the editing room floor.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It runs smooth and looks great. The one ad between games on my cell dont bother me. It has become my &quot;moment of sanity&quot;  when I take a break during the day
B007PTJOV0|5.0|loved it great for kids<br />my seven year old loves playing it. I think it would be entertaining for all ages.
0545265355|5.0|This series was excellent! I started out wanting to read Hunger Games before I saw the movie, but ended up finishing all three books in less than a week and I work 50+ hours per week!!!!  It is touching and enrapturing because I couldn't put it down.  Love this series and Katniss and Peeta!  Now can't wait to see the movie - although I now not only know how the book ends, but the entire series as well. <3
1423136802|4.0|I've had this collection for awhile and have only recently had the time to start reading them. I devoured the first three books very quickly and when I moved on to the fourth I found out, much to my disappointment, that my 1-5 book series was instead bound with two number three's! Still an excellent series, but disappointed that I'm having to buy another book when this should have completed the collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app on my kindle fire! great colors-customize your own game features. and I like that you have several draw options!
B00005J6T0|4.0|True Blue is Madonna's third album and what many consider to be her best.  \\"Live To Tell\\" was released a few months before the album and was from the film At Close Range which starred her then husband Sean Penn.  It may well be Madonna's best song.  It is a deep and powerful song with a surprising strong vocal.  It has a deep message of the lasting effects of childhood trauma that mirrors the film. It landed at number one and set the stage for the album.  The next single \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" also had a message about teen pregnancy and abortion that generated some controversy at the time but didn't prevent the song was also rising to number one.  The third single was the title track and it is a 180 in style and sound from the first two singles.  It has a bouncy 60's girl group sound and video features a young Debi Mazar and topped out at number 3. \\"Open Your Heart\\" was the fourth single that again brought her back to number one.  The fifth and final single was the latin influenced \\"La Isla Bonita\\" which again found Madonna branching out her sound and made it up to number 4 on the charts.  \\"Where's The Party\\" is a fun song that would have made a great single and \\"Love Makes The World Round\\" is another strong album cut.  The album brought Madonna to the top of the album charts where it stayed for five weeks.  While not quite as big as Like A Virgin, it did sell 7 million copies.
B004X4QW42|1.0|I had to maintain too much suspension of disbelief. Where was all the magical acrobatic stuff with the boxer? Jet Li's Fearless was in the end a more interesting version of the 2 IP Man movies. I could believe Hercules O'Brien shrugging off a martial artist's blows but I wasn't sure how Twister was superior to Fan Siu-wong's similarly beefy character.
B00005J6SZ|3.0|Released in late 1984, Madonna's Like A Virgin made the artist a megastar.  Buoyed by the title track (and a racy performance of the song at the MTV Video Music Awards show), the album shot to the top of the charts of became one of the biggest selling albums ever by a female artist with 10 million in sales.  The album produced four top ten singles.  Even though the title track was the only to reach number one, \\"Material Girl\\" has become the most enduring and become an unwanted nickname for the singer.  Channeling her inner Marilyn Monroe, the song has become a symbol of the excess of the 80's.  It is undeniable catchy and try to get it out of your head after hearing it. Surprisingly it peaked at number two kept out of the top spot by REO Speedwagon and Phil Collins. \\"Angel\\" & \\"Dress You Up\\" both peaked at number five. Her cover of Rose Royce's \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" is a superior song to the other two and could have been a big hit if it was released as a single.

Bared to you is right there with them.. I loved this book.. Gideon is a young, rich, powerful man. and Eva has self doubt issues, has had some really terrible things that have happened to her.. but hopefully with Gideon in her life she will be able to get over some of them..<br /><br />this is the first book that i have read from Ms. Day and i can now say it won't be the last.. I am very impressed with her writing style and her characters are loveable, and easy to get to know..<br /><br />I can't wait for more of Gideon and Eva!!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun. I'm so glad i downloaded it. i give it sive stars. i highly recommend this game.
B002APU580|3.0|If you're interested in the what the actors are saying- try a different format than this streaming site. The video quality is grainy, but tolerable. The audio quality is less than acceptable- won't use Amazon again unless it is for something where sound is not an issue.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music it very relaxing, the great graphics make this simple but intriguing game a nice diversion from the daily grind.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There are no words to describe how amazing this series is. It has everything a reader could want. I read the first book because a friend suggested it, and I couldn't put it down. I read the whole series in two days, and was so disappointed when I finished reading, because I loved the books so much. I can't wait to re-read the books, and am dying for a fourth book to come out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like it. but I wish I didn't use all my money. U can fish and hunt the bear look weird thou.
B004GYY714|5.0|this is utterly awesome. the ability to listen to not only US stations but also international. being a sports fanatic I can listen to sports radio from differant regions and follow teams I like not in my area as if I was local
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its the coolest game ever! very similar to super Mario brothers! wooooo! woo! wooooooo! woo! woo! woo! woo! woo! wooo!
B006FE83U4|5.0|I wouldn't like to comment on the movie which is just top class, a classic in the true sense. What made my day were the interviews of Gregory Peck and others. The Blu-ray is a gem and worth its weight in gold. Gregory Peck is at his best and I am pretty sure no one could have done better than what he did in this movie. This should be a collectors delight.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|with the new features not only can u read but u can highlight and anotate the text. just what i needed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you can choose between random deal or a winning deal in case you want an easy boost. I'm glad kindle has a free solitaire that's so fun
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game, love it um like how you don't have to pay anything I think pa is lazy tho he doesn't do anything lol
B000XCZGV8|5.0|This is an excellent movie about a complicated and difficult case, told partially from the perspective of a young newspaper cartoonist who becomes fascinated with the case, which is based on the real life author of the book of the same title: [[ASIN:0425212734 Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed]]. The recreations of the killings themselves are chilling and extremely well done, and the times are places captured perfectly. All the details of this long and complex case are well presented, and the gradual focus on the most likely suspect is well presented, as is the missteps and failures of law enforcement to collaborate effectively. A thoroughly enjoyable crime drama. The extra features are quite interesting too, including documentary interviews with some of the major players as well as one of the victims who survived.

0385344228|5.0|One has to enjoy an unsolved murder that ends in alot of courtroom dialogue but, for me, a real page turner.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like this game. It puts me in a mildly meditative mood. Nice graphics,  soothing music. Pleasant,  calming diversion before bedtime.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Things start off simple. Then progress into something frustrating. Time is well wasted with this puzzeling little game. If your looking for some in expensive entertainment. This will quell your thirst.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it. Having read this trilogy, I can see that we may become Panem some day, as the divide between the rich and the elimination of the middle class becomes greater. Katniss, Peter, Gale and the other characters are a riveting group and I could not put this down. I'm really glad that all 3 books have been published, I cannot imagine waiting for the next book.<br /><br />Book 2 was just as engrossing as The Hunger Games, I never expected the story to repeat itself, having a 25 year Quell game is just another way of terrorizing the districts,being able to vary the manner of the games is a way to keep them guessing, of course I wouldn't have thought the Capital would change the rules of the games as they went along. There's a prime example of a political entity with no conscience or respect for the little people.<br /><br />This book starts where The Hunger Gamess left off, Katniss and Peeta are preparing to start the Victory Tour but Katniss hates the idea of appearing before crowds who have to come when and cheer after their own children were killed, especially those who she liked or respected. Katniss has realized that the Capital wants only to impose their will on the districts and will smash anyone who threatens them in any way. While they are on tour they start to discover just how malevolent the Capital is and the extremes they are willing to go to, in order to keep their rigid control on the districts.<br /><br />I had to remember how young Katniss and Peeta are, they were pushed into a world they never wanted to enter. Just because the perception of their act in daring to call the capital's bluff was determined to be an act of rebellion.<br /><br />This is an incrediable series and Ms. Collins has earned all the acclaim she is being given. The film is wonderful, there are a few differences but its true to the authors intentions. I really liked knowing the motivation and thought process of the actors. Simply outstanding!tstanding!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I am in love with this series, and this was just a must in getting! It was packaged perfectly and works like a charm!!!! I'm so pleased with this! It was wonderfully priced as well!

B002JVWRAO|5.0|This was packaged well, priced wonderfully and worked perfectly! I love this series and this was a must have!!!!! Everything was just as described.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|I have known these songs a long time, and only had the cassette, so finally upgraded and bought the music. Definately worth buying if you like their music.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|In an age where it seems like all of the TV and movies are filled with garbage, Courageous is a great relief. The story is realistic, the acting is good, and the movie skillfully maintains comedy while addressing the impact that a father has on his family. I think that every father should see this inspiring film as a reminder of their responsibility to their family. Also, you should have no problem allowing your family to watch this movie. The absence of foul language, blood/gore, and sexuality makes it an appropriate movie to show at home with your children. I would give this movie six stars if I could; it teaches great lessons in a an engaging (and family-friendly) way. Now how many movies can boast of the same these days?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun game. a lot like Sim city. would be better if you did not run out of energy so fast. it does encourage you to buy stuff with real money :(
B00006IXEE|1.0|I seen this movie when it first came out, on T.V. Recently I decided I wanted to purchase this movie, not only for myself, but my daughter, and a friend. It turns out when you reside in the United States, you can not watch/play a movie that states Region 2 on it. I was not aware of what the Region 2 meant, so was unable to watch the DVD and had to send them back. Although I was disappointed about this, Amazon was right on top of their game. They sent a refund directly back to my credit card I used immediately. And they even refunded a portion of the postage I paid to send the DVDs back. What a GREAT company, they really do put their customers first. I will definitely be using this company again in the near future for other purchases. Thank you.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Great movie. Special effects are dated, but for the 1980's it was great! I just hope that Amazon makes the TV series available in Prime.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|This game is great for killing time and if you want to battle your friends!<br />Its impossible to beat the computer on a higher difficulty tho

B007MJSYF0|5.0|My library got a copy of this and while it is way enjoyable, it is way over the top.<br /><br />I listened to it in Japanese and you should too.<br /><br />It the perfect MST3000 movie, you don't need to understand what's being said.<br /><br />I didn't and I was able to predict items and actions before they occurred.<br /><br />So It's a definite buy from me, 5 stars all the way.<br /><br />No wonder the birthrate in Japan is falling, the guys are all gay and I'm for gay rights and marriage.<br /><br />The girls are all button cute and in full uniform.<br /><br />Fan service and knee socks are not my thing, but again I'm buying this.<br /><br />No wonders Sony is almost broke, they didn't make this turkey but I'm sure someone somewhere had something to do with this.<br /><br />Jacob
B0063IH60K|5.0|It makes me think and I hate losing. I love the challenge! Feel great when I win and makes me want to keep playing so I can beat my time.

6305150354|5.0|I have had a copy of Titanic on laserdisc since shortly after it was released to home video and what a copy to have after all these years.  For those oblivious to the laserdisc format, they were large serving plate sized discs that were introduced in the late 1970's to compete with betamax and VHS but never really could because of production costs - the players and individual movies were expensive to produce but if you had the money for either, you were in the closest fidelity to what you could get at the local theater.<br /><br />Laserdiscs were made until the early 2000s so films like \\"Titanic\\" were the start of final hurrahs for the format.  This version of \\"Titanic\\" is a two-disc, four-sided CLV letterbox feature with AC-3/Dolby Digital audio, which was the standard presentation for the epic films at time.  The little more than three hour-film is spread across the discs in forty-five to fifty-five minute intervals with breaks in the lulls in the subplots - so even after potty breaks or getting more snacks, you can quickly jump back to drama as another plot starts.<br /><br />I will leave the reviews of the actual film to those given to [[ASIN:B00000JLWW other formats]] as I mostly concerned with conserving, for posterity, the laserdisc presentation of an incredible film.  If you are looking to buy a laserdisc copy, note that according the LDDB it exists in both a letterbox and full-screen version for 4:3 screens so buyer beware if the seller does not explicitly declare which version they are selling.
0553386794|5.0|Not having seen the HBO series but having read the books, I was eager to see how they managed this.  LOVED it and the additional materials, describing the characters and maps really helped keep everything straight.  Can't wait for Season 2.
B005ERWYH6|5.0|They are no words to describe Adele.shes so amazing and her voice will touch your soul.This is the most amazing cd Iv ever heard in my life.She so incredible and I look foward to more of her music.<br />This cd is a must for any Adele fan with 2-extra tracks.Love this cd so much! This albumn will change your life!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|ThIs is the first review I have ever been compelled to write and I am an AVID romance reader. The story of Gideon an Eva is such a compelling and complicated story I could not put it down. If you enjoy reading romance that is not \\"cookie cutter\\" and has many highs and lows this is the book for you!  I loved the Fifty shades trilogy but after finishing this first book in the Crossfire series I have to agree with some of the other reviews that this is better. I cannot wait for the next book! Pick this up you will not be disappointed!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Dont buy this game. It only took me two days to finish the entire game!! 2 of the planets only have 10 levels!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds me of Mario on Nintendo!I can't stop playing it since I got it! Wish the controls were a little easier.
B0076NAWWA|1.0|I remember as a young teenager I bought some unknown CDs out of a discount rock bin (don't ask me to name them, I can't even begin to remember).  They were uninspired, directionless, and plain... a lot like this album.  I was pretty excited (a lot of hype surrounding it, and the artists on it are great), so my disappointment was of the kid gets coal for Christmas variety... it's that bad, and that much of a letdown.  The only thing noteworthy about this album are the artists performing on it.  I would send you to a tube sight to give a few tracks a listen, but no one has uploaded any, and the band probably won't either.  All Falls Down is the only track that I could even begin to stand hearing again. The rest is awful.  Do not use that song as a basis to judge the rest of the record.  The other tracks are all over the place and there is no coherent sound.  While in some cases track variety can be a good thing - in this case it is not.  Do not waste your money.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I've only just started playing it, but it's pretty entertaining. It takes me back to my youth and old Mario bros. I think my kids will enjoy it too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the second in the Hunger Games trilogy and it was everything the first installment was maybe even a little more. I am havings a hard time trying to figure out which one I like better
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have had an android since the G1 came out and loved the idea of Linux based customization. Yet I couldn't find a calendar app. that would allow me a few simple, particular customizations, until now! Finally! I can set my reminders to ANY default time length I want to! I can set the reminder to go off however many minutes before the event I want. I can even search for old reminders/events instead of scrolling through days and days of events! Wish I would have known about this app. when it first came out. Amazing customization!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|idk why but I'm addicted to this game. my only problem is when you try selecting something that's behind another something, and it choose the one in front.<br /><br />TIP: make sure no buildings are infront of your towns people<br /><br />kindle fire~
0061438294|5.0|Okay, so I really enjoyed this book because it took a difficult and foreign subject and made it digestible for the modern busy person that jumps around from topic to topic. So, I'm going to make my review an explanation of people's complaints against this book and why they are valid - but don't necessarily take away from the book.<br /><br />I read that it's repetitive, common sense and lacks information. Other books in this field will give you tons of gestures you may not have thought of that you can memorize if you wish. You can find books for certain fields. But the reason people say these are common sense is because he explains the logic behind them - making them common sense. Instead of memorizing lists of gestures, you can figure them out because his explanations will teach you to realize that certain gestures are defensive or calming or assertive.<br /><br />I've seen reviews saying that the information is invalid. This book is filled with citations. Yes, certain things are not scientifically proven because the focus is on a part of the brain that's hard to study - but it works. This guy is an expert.. I rather he make it easier on me and give me his logic that makes sense, is most likely true, and saves me so much time. If you rather spend tons of time learning something that may work (technically, the science behind this is decades away - yet case studies and the government's usage of these techniques prove them to be accurate), go for it. I rather save tons of time to use something that will work.<br /><br />Lastly, the stories in the book kept my interest. If you want 300 pages filled to the brim with information and no anecdotes or pictures, this may not be for you. It personally kept me interested and made me remember a lot better.<br /><br />This is an intro book to NLP. You can use it as a standalone book or delve deeper into certain aspects of nonverbal communication. I like the pictures. I like the stories. I like the writing style. I like the knowledge that this guy is an experienced professional. Maybe those aren't things everyone values, but this is one of the only books on the topic that I could actually read and stay focused on. I'm confident that even if I didn't read another book on this - the basic logic BEHIND why this works gave me the push I need to discover a lot more about reading people.
B006Q6MOCY|5.0|This remaster is the best work on PET SOUNDS, the presentation is exellent! both SACD and CD sound incredible, highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. We are reading it aloud as a family and everyone is enjoying it.  I am always a couple chapters ahead because after the kids go to bed I continue to read ahead.
0345803485|4.0|The book starts out a little slow - nothing special, but as soon as the sex scenes begin it gets intriguing. Ana and Christian are the main characters and it's a lot of cat and mouse chase. He loves me, he loves me not. Gets kind of repetitive and predictable at parts, but still entertaining. I almost gave up on the book half-way through, but I'm glad I finished reading it because it gets a lot better at the end. I immediately downloaded the 2nd book and it's great so far. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy graphic sex scenes, but if you are conservative and don't like to talk about sex - don't read this!
0439023491|5.0|Don't get me wrong the first book was amazing. It's what started it all , but this one I found myself more into. I couldn't put it down at all. There was a lot twists and turns. There's a lot of action and the new characters are pretty interesting.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|reminds me of grade school. much more advanced<br />my kids are as hooked as I was at their age :-)
B007PTJOV0|1.0|I feel like if I install this game my identity will get stolen. Whoever wrote the description must have crudely copy/pasted text from a free translator. Leo's World / Mario World. This game shouldn't even exist lol. I seriously find it hard to believe that this game has 5 stars on Amazon Appstore, home of some of the most unreasonable and ignorant reviewers lol! Maybe I'm including myself in that group with this review but I'll be darned if this app isn't stealing something from its users. Skeezee out.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I have searched all around the web for the most affordable and reliable stabilizer. This is the one. Most i have seen usually cost at best $700+. This one works as smooth as the others I've seen. The finish quality of the product is clean. Very adjustable in all directions to finalize your center. As a beginner, it takes a bit of practice. But once you get the hang of how to manipulate the adjustments. Its very simple to set up. I recommend those who are looking for an affordable and reliable stabilizer at a budget. GET THIS!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Like the game,  fun to play but the energy runs out fast.  I don't like waiting so long for energy.
B000SO7OMA|2.0|The concert itself is quite nice though i heard much better arrangements for some tracks in former years. The drums are quite weird in that sort of music for example (remembers me to some sort of James Last mood). The sound engineering is of the worst i have met for years. Loreenas voice is clippind frequently when it gets a little louder. The harp and other instruments a hardly been heard in some tracks thogh you can see them being played (remebers me to silent movie ages). The video qality is fluffy and lacks of blillinace at all. If you belong to those species who don't notice these all these things, you would be happy with that recording maybe. To me its a pitty that none of Loreenas music ever was engineered propperly through all those long long years. But this recording beats them all maybe.

0345803485|1.0|Okay. I'll try again, this time with feeling. My first review couldn't be posted, guess you can sell erotica but you can't properly review it.<br /><br />Here goes-<br /><br />The story--<br /><br />E.l. James started this as Twilight fan fic & anyone who has read that stuff will understand. James writing is only so-so. This very much seems like something written by a teenager. I mean, \\"holy cow\\", come ON. If I read that phrase in another book I'd lose it. The characters are not portrayed very well, first one is supposed to be submissive and one a dominant. By the end of the book I was confused. Who was what? Neither role was clearly defined. The banter between the 2 was not believable based on the novels pretense at all. James was aiming at a young crowd with this I think. But being the good Old' US of A she should know that talking about sex in a book automatically gets you slammed into the erotica sex-tion.<br /><br />The sex--<br /><br />Again, poorly written. Ana who totally lacks any experience here suddenly morphs into a sex goddess able to \\"perform on demand\\" for her dom. Yeah, not typically going to happen. Especially if the scene went down as written. James descriptions, such as, \\"down there\\", come on, what are we 12? I feel given the tone she was trying to set she could've been more adult in her phrasing. Bottom line, everyone complains fashion mags set unreal ideals for women. Well, this book sets unreal ideals for sex. It rarely plays out like James writes IF EVER.<br /><br />The characters--<br /><br />Ana--I'm not exactly sure WHAT James was trying to write with her. The plucky, gotta have it my way, while trying to change a lifelong dominant male routine reminds me of another female protagonist from ANOTHER series that was completely unbelievable. Moving on......Ana in my view is an immature, whining, confusing unsympathetic character. As she waffles from one scene to the next I found her less and less believable.<br /><br />Christian-- Is he a man or a mouse? I couldn't believe the direction James went with him. He starts out as cool, calm, collected & then becomes a whipped little boy clamoring for Ana's attention while also desiring to punish her into submission. Okay. One minute he wishes to punish her, the other he's taking her gliding. Ana says she loves him, Christian is horrified saying that's not good. Ana starts to leave & Christian goes from \\"you can't love me\\" to looking broken, torn apart and absolutely dejected\\".<br /><br />James story, while the premise was promising is nothing short of a work of contradictions. I'd give it zero stars if I could. All the women who thought the story was so erotic & sexy....\\"You guys need to get out more\\".
B004BSAEQC|5.0|Nicki at her finest Excellent album. She has dispelled the sophomore album myth Congrats and much success.  Can't wait to see more from her
B007R41E8O|4.0|I, as others have mentioned also had problems downloading the resources for this game. The amazon portion downloaded and installed fine, then you have to download about 350mb in game before you can play. I had to do that 5 times before I could play. It would download, then check, and restart the download. 5x350mb is a lot even on wifi.<br /><br />Now for the game. It's a cross between the fire maple games like lost city, and pure hidden object games. Graphics are very well done and justify the large download. Easily worth the price and if they get the download issue sorted out I would easily recommend this to hidden object fans or fans of the fire maple style games.
B003IWRE3I|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I should have walked out 15 minutes in. I kept thinking it has to get better right? Yea it didn't. It was horrible! Worst movie ever made! Do not buy this movie. I give this a zero star rating!
030758836X|4.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />This is a difficult book to summarize without spoilers, but I will do so because part of the fun of this novel is to be surprised by all the twists and turns.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating chapters from the POV of the two main characters, Nick Dunne and his wife, Amy Elliot Dunne.  Amy's chapters are from her diary entries which begin before she and Nick marry. We know from the start that Amy is missing and it appears that she has been violently kidnapped from their home on their 5th wedding anniversary.<br /><br />The book itself is divided into three sections. In the first section, we are given some of the history of the relationship between Amy and Nick, and we able to read about the conflicts and strife that make up their marriage.  We know that Amy and Nick moved from their affluent home in Manhattan to  his childhood home in the midwest. Both Amy and Nick lost their jobs and Nick now helps run a bar he owns from money from Amy.<br /><br />The second section of the book - and this is where I don't want to summarize anymore because it would give away some key plot points and twists. Suffice it to say that you may want to go back and reread some of what you read earlier. I think the author does a masterful job here in making us rethink the story, and the personalities of those involved.<br /><br />I have read all of Gillian Flynn's books and I think she's a terrific suspense writer. This one started off a little slowly to me, but by the second part of the book I was fully hooked and read the rest it in one sitting until the end.<br /><br />Again, without giving anything away, I think there are going to be a lot of opinions about the ending.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0065IA4F2|5.0|This was an amazing purchase. I can't believe I got the whole album for so cheap. I love you Amazon!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the oregon trail game is fun, entertaining and very interactive with lots to do.  I just don't like how quickly the energy runs out.the Oregon trail
B004H51706|5.0|My kids love this rover and so do I.  While it is still made of plastic, it does not feel like the usual cheap plastic found in most toys.  It is a well designed and manufactured replica of a Land Rover Defender 90 td5.  Each axle articulates and the front wheels are steerable.  All of the doors, hood and sunroof open/close.  It also tows the Bruder horse trailer.  My kids have has hours upon hours of equestrian safaris.  Great toy.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|really liked the books. loved how detailed it was and the world the author created. didnt end exactly the way i wouldve liked but cant complain.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not sure why the reviews are so low.  I found this to be a very realistic ending to the trilogy.  The revolution happened, the rebels fought the capitol.  That's the story of this book.  We have our Mockingjay...<br /><br />I loved this story, it's just as sad and brutal as the others but with a happy ending in my opinion.  That's my entire review because I don't want to give anything away and here's something I never do, but I am retaliating against complaints I've been reading in reviews:<br /><br />Spoilers... the bad reviews have a couple of major complaints... Gale's maybe being involved in making the bomb that killed the children and Prim, and Katniss ending unhappily married to Peeta.<br /><br />My ideas on those two issues, Gale and Katniss worked it out in her own way of acceptance and Gale chose the \\"fancy job\\" in district 2.  He chose not to go back to 12.  Peeta chose to go back to 12 and wanted to be with Katniss, and there's acceptance there too.  She admitted to knowing all along he was what she needed, they went through their own therapy, had children and coped the best they could.  Nothing in there said she was a zombie or unhappy, she loved her kids and knowing they wouldn't compete in any Hunger Games.  It said, she wasn't sure how she felt until she held her child.  As a mother, I get that.

B007H7XJD4|3.0|Mickey Rourke is a terrible actor. He anticipates action with pre reaction and says his lines like he has something in his mouth in an attempt to be more macho. He was a detraction from the movie. The storyline was entertaining but it amazed me after having found the bow and having fended off so much to keep it, he couldn't hang on to it. It was an ok movie.

0143119680|2.0|A vampire book for adults that isn't written by Anne Rice? With witches and daemons as well? And it opens in Oxford. \\"What could be more fun?\\", I asked myself. A Discovery of Witches has a very promising start. American Academic Diana Bishop is visiting the university to study the Bodleian's collection of ancient alchemical manuscripts. One ordinary afternoon, she calls up Ashmole 782, and some very peculiar things occur - shimmering pages, weird illustrations, and, she can't help but notice, spells and secret messages visible only to those who are in the know. Being a witch herself, descended from the infamous Bridget Bishop of Salem, MA, Diana's in the know, though she'd rather not be and tries hard not to use her formidable powers. The instant she and 782 meet, the entire local community of others (i.e., nonhuman creatures) swarm around her, and not because they're so excited for her. Diana is wary, but finds herself attracted to one of the others, a very ancient, very rich, and very handsome vampire, Matthew Clairmont. Long story short, they fall in love against all prohibitions, and go on all sorts of adventures to unearth the meaning of 782.<br /><br />This vampire book is not suitable for adults, it's way too inane. Diana has her doctorate and a very independent life, yet behaves like an adolescent with a crush on a rock star. Matthew wants to \\"feed\\" on Diana, but because he's so in love, contains his bestial instincts. Other characters are equally as insipid and stereotypical. Surprisingly, since the author is a serious scholar herself, the history is mushy and given short shrift in favor of the mushy romance. Too lengthy, too wordy, too slow, and ultimately mindless and boring. For a much better experience on the same sort of topic, read Endymion Spring, by Matthew Skelton, which is billed as a young adult novel, but has more than enough authenticity to hook full fledged adults too.
0345803485|1.0|I read  A LOT, and I have only not finished a book twice in my life, but right now, I don't know if I can go on with this one.<br /><br />I mentally punch the protagonist every time she talks about her inner goddess. I find Ana incredibly annoying. I lost track of how many times she says, 'Holy crap' and 'Oh my'<br /><br />I felt that the emotion was lacking big time. I have read novels that were far less graphic than this, and yet were somehow so much hotter. I just didn't buy it, it literally did nothing for me.<br /><br />Of all the ridiculous things in this book, the one I had the hardest time swallowing was that a 21 year old in college did not have an email address.. I mean..really? REALLY?<br /><br />Its so easy for me to like a book, I always get sucked in, but right now I am looking for excuses to NOT read, and that is just not normal. Time to stop.
B006FE83U4|5.0|One of the best films of all time.  Gregory Peck is perfect in the role as is the entire cast.  The subject is as relevant to today as when the film was made.  The print is like you are seeing it in the theater.
B0058U0EEO|5.0|There is not a song on this album I don't love! Awesome chill music that doesn't get old. Great addition to any playlist. Can't wait for more from them.
B000002MJC|5.0|The band's 1993 album Songs of Faith and Devotion has always been my favorite. Thematically, it is their most cohesive, with songs deftly overlapping desire and spirituality. Musically, the layers of noise reveal something new the more you listen. Dave Gahan is more energetic, almost aggressive throughout the album, tearing himself up emotionally as if he has to fight against the music itself. The band seems to be stepping forward, out from behind their keyboards, and really engaging themselves with their audience. (Indeed, when I saw them live on this tour, it was nice to see them actually do more than standing in place, shifting their weight periodically while they tap out notes. It was a hell of a show.)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game...would reccomend it to all my friends and family.  great job Ner brothers. this game rocks.  don't know why my review has to be an20 word min.

0741470314|5.0|Dr. Moriarty's biography of Michael Jackson was not the typical book that I read.  However, now that I have read it, I can say that it is exceptional.  In each chapter she takes the reader through a different aspect of Michael Jackson's life, and she explores in special depth the last few years of his life, which were a mystery because he kept so private.<br /><br />I had no idea that he was such a complex, vulnerable person, a victim on many levels.  He was also deservedly an inspiration to people around the world.  I have an understanding now of who he was and what he experienced in his unparalleled life.  This is a book that my grandchildren could read; it is done with sensitivity and care to avoid the type of lurid or sensationalized material that is used in so many other books.  Well done!
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer exposes the politically correct and financially corrupt elitists who whitewash the atrocities of the Islamo-fascist terrorists.

Do not miss this one!

B006CDDNRQ|5.0|An insightful journey into the dynamics of tribal formation which naturally occurs in any size organization. A roadmap for the smart leader.[[ASIN:1591842336 Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us]]
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is the first of the trilogy. Well written and very descriptive enough to give the reader an erotic feeling. The propose of the book is pure eroticism; and the books meets it purpose.<br /> It also tells the readers , how an innocent vergin girl falls for an experienced guy who is looking for pure selfish pleasure and is incapable of loving and being loved. A pity!!<br />As the books progressed through a very descriptive narrative of sexual encounter, it also takes you through the gray shades of the protagonist. The reason why he does this comes clear- he want to pay back the same way he got it.<br /><br />It is a good book to read with excellent descriptions. Must read for those who are looking for this genere of literature.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it(: Its someing to do when u are bored! glad I down loaded it! its has good games so I wont get bored!

0385504225|2.0|I can never get those wasted hours back.  Far too contrived to be interesting.  Only the characters are surprised by one of the puported plot twists.  Fortunately, I was loaned the book, or I'd feel cheated.

0801896940|5.0|I first heard of Emmy Noether when I was a high school student and how she had proved some abstract theorem which involved symmetry, invariance and conservation of energy.  The small morsel provided to me then was something like spatial translation symmetry giving rise to conservation of momentum. At that stage  I had no idea how this was proved nor how it fitted into the whole edifice of physics.  But it seemed like a big idea.  In the 1960s and 1970s you couldn't find a book like Neuenschwander's.  Neuenschwander's book fills in all the gaps as he takes you through the nuts and bolts of the significance of the theorem, its derivation and applications. The maths is at undergraduate level and, despite various typos that others have commented upon, it is a pretty comprehensive treatment for this type of explicatory book.  The type of person who buys this book will probably sit down and go through the derivations and verify them (or spot the glitch as the case may be).  I am not aware of any other book which goes through this particular subject at so accessible a level.  Noether's original paper is harder to digest - if in doubt, try it - there is a translation on the UCLA physics website.  Once you delve into this type of material you begin to wonder too about the fundamental mathematical approximations used to derive the theorems.  You begin to appreciate the ubiquity of Taylor's Theorem (applied to produce a local approximation) and wonder that the end results work globally.  But that would be another book.  It is interesting to note that a well known PDE expert, Peter Olver, wrote a really negative comment about Neuenschwander's book in a review he wrote of a competing book by Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach - “The Noether Theorems”. The review is in the  Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol 50, No 1, January 2013 and it is to be noted that Olver is mentioned for his special help in assisting Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach in developing her manuscript.  These two books are completely different in their aims. Neuenschwander's book poses all sorts of exercises to develop understanding of what is a deep concept.  Criticising this approach is like criticising a formula 1 driver for starting out in GP 3 cars before getting into the more demanding F1 car.  Hilariously I have one of Olver's books on PDEs which some PDE experts with a different focus could criticise for being too low beer!  I'd love to see some of the nobodies who have criticised this book write the &#34;definitive&#34; expose so we can judge their talent.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Plot and Theme: Human Cruelty<br />If you are not used to graphic details of torture and sexual violence, then this book is going to be a torture for you. I walked into this novel having no idea what the plot was and was truly shocked by the graphic cruelty described throughout the book. The book describes in detail different types of physical violence and torture done to women (sometimes men) in the central plot and subplots. It feels like the compelling story is a lucky by-product, as the book was simply a tool for Laarson to expose the dark reality of human cruelty, especially violence against women, which is likely why the character developments for all the characters and side-characters are quite fragmented. It often feels like a character is just put in there so a type of harm done to them can be written. It's not that the story is not good--it is, but the theme of sexual violence, including the cruelties that are described, could have still been properly conveyed with a tighter writing and a tighter plotline, without all the fragmented subplots within. There were too many stories in there that could be broken into separate books as well.<br /><br />Real Hero: Still a Man<br />Ironically for a book that centres mostly on the victimization of women, it seems to spend a little too much time on the main male protagonist of the book. Often times it feels like he's the real hero and this world that Larsson created is just for him, and Lisbeth Salander is just his sidekick who knows how to get information. The book title should have stayed with \\"Men who Hate Women,\\" as the book focuses on all the men in the series and all women had very little role besides playing victim, including Lisbeth Salander. Though Lis does fight back hard unlike the rest of the women in the story, her role was very small in comparison to the main guy. It does not feel like a book that champions women at all. As opposed to \\"Look at all the crap that's done to women you didn't know about, let's empower people to do something about it,\\" it's more like, \\"Look, here's all the crap you didn't know that is done to women. Man saves day with help of woman.\\"<br /><br />Product Placement<br />I was also quite shocked with the details on the branding of all the hardware used in the book. Apple products and specific models are described in detail. There were other brands described that were used by the main characters, but Apple definitely is the winner. I could have done without any of that.<br /><br />Overall Read-worthy?<br />I'm a bit conflicted on this. The plot and the violence draws you in completely and you want to keep reading to see how it plays out--some of which is disappointing. The plot is old, the stories are great, the narrative is engaging, and the writing is mediocre. Not surprisingly, the book is not by any means literary and if you give it the expectation of a simple dime crime novel, then it will definitely exceed your expectation. But you are looking for literature, then you will be sorely disappointed. And, like I said, if you are not used to graphic details of torture and sexual violence, then this book is going to be torturous for you.'s empower people to do something about it,\\" it's more like, \\"Look, here's all the crap you didn't know that is done to women.

1455113549|4.0|I had a feeling I was going to enjoy this legal thriller, as it was written by a former District Attorney in Massachusetts.  It's a good one; it's thought provoking, engrossing, and every parents worst nightmare.<br /><br />In a small Massachusetts town, a young boy is found murdered in the woods. How could something so brutal happen in this previously quiet community? Initially a pedophile is suspected, but soon, another classmate, fourteen-year old Jacob Barber, the only child of well respected district attorney, Andy Barber, is a person of interest and eventually charged with his classmate's murder.  Jacob admits to finding the body in the woods, touching the body, but being afraid to tell anyone about it.  Andy and his wife Laurie find it hard to believe that their could ever be capable of such an act, but yet at times they wonder if it could be true. Jacob's is a sullen boy, often moody and withdrawn and full of secrets. The fact he has posted things on Facebook that could be used against him, will not help in proving his innocence.  The family is from a nice suburban town, and is shamed and shunned by the community. Their 20-year marriage begins to come apart at the seams.<br /><br />The story rolled out a bit too slowly, and began with a grand jury investigation. The reader is not really sure of  what is going on,  or even all of the details for a while.  Once the story gets going though, it was totally addictive.  I listened to the audio version as well as reading the eBook, and even my husband got hooked on it as we drove to Boston and listened.  We still keep talking about the prosecutor's name, as it was very unusual, and just seems to have attached itself to our brains....Neil (sounds like Lajewdis), after hearing it so many time on audio.<br /><br />The audio book reader, Grover Gardner was excellent, and the ending blew us away.  It's a good story complete with secrets, family skeletons and one story that begs the reader to examine just how far you might go to protect your family.<br /><br />Try it.ht go to protect your family.<br /><br />Try it.
0316098329|4.0|Greatest example of love. It reinforces the greatest bond in the world, that between a Mother and her child. Heroic roles for both Ma and Jack. The writing is poetic and thrilling. Our book club did not want to read at first, but finally did and all loved it. Not sure if men would find this as exciting.
B000002WPI|5.0|Amazon should have a platinum rating for these kind of albums. Brilliant, both in terms of beats and lyrics, it is one of the most (if not the most) influential hip-hop albums ever made. Do get it, you'll be doing yourself a favor and will make you love this genre in its entirety.
0694007099|5.0|This beautifully illustrated book is about a mouse looking for the right friend. There is not dialogue beyond \\"Do you want to be my friend?\\". The lack of dialogue allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions about what the other animals are saying in response to the mouse. In the end, the mouse finds other mice who emphatically answer \\"yes\\" and they become friends. I do not see any negative aspect to this book, as other reviewers have. In my opinion (as an Elementary School Teacher) this book is not about rejection and bigotry, but is about perseverance and never losing hope. Not everyone will want to be your friend, and that's OK. Keep trying, and you will find people who love you for you! This book is fun. By the way, the ALA adored it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I am not....repeat...not an emotional person.  I read this book in a very short time..some at work...on the train and at home.  It is so well written that I forgot that I was reading a work of fiction and found myself almost in tears (at work, on the train)and finally at home.  The last few chapters, I had the tissue out and had to stop reading a few times as I was actually crying!  Shocker...even as I write that sentence.  I'm going to put myself out there and say it is probably one of the best books I've read in a while.  Buy it.  Enjoy. I seriously was emotionally involved...and forgot it was just a book.  Great writer!  Bravo.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|Synopsis: general: in a (presumably) future dystopia, a country is divided into about a dozen districts, all under the heel of an autocratic central government. Decades ago, a revolt was put down and one of the results is that each district must annually present two tributes to the central government to fight to the death until only one survives, who is then rewarded. In this way, a certain degree of divide and conquer is maintained by the central government. The gladiator combat is televised and has become such an obsession in the society that our obsession with football/soccer/basketball pales by comparison.<br /><br />Synopsis: specific: out of dirt-poor District 12 a girl substitutes herself for her younger sister, who would obviously last all of ten seconds in the arena. The older sister (Katniss) is adept at the bow and arrow, so she may stand a chance. She and the boy are sent to the capital, where food and luxury are abundant. The inhabitants of the capital have makeup and dress as if Salvador Dali and Lady Gaga had been given the run of the place. All tributes are treated as celebrities, and participate in training and in-depth interviews conducted by Ceasar Flickerman, sporting an outrageous outfit and wig and played by Stanley Tucci, a character actor whose star has lately been rising rapidly. Throughout, none of the adults seem to appreciate the immorality of the situation; it just does not register with these people. Ultimately, Katniss is sent to the outdoor arena where she has to survive her vicious opponents. The weak tributes are dispatched quickly by the others and then it is her turn. However, her personality is a bit unique and this comes to her advantage. In order not to spoil the movie, I will stop here.<br /><br />This film is an adaptation of the poorly-written novel by the same title; it is better than the book on several levels. Aside from the writing style, the book is written in first person, but the movie has scenes that she could not bea part of but which help the movie, particularly the meetings between the people who pull the strings.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good dystopian movie. Unlike the majority of the genre, it does have a happy ending.

0553386794|5.0|I had never heard of this book series before watching the series (season 1) on HBO. I didn't think I needed to read the books but I'm so glad I did. I borrowed book 1 & 2 from a coworker and was hooked. I just received on Tuesday the 4-set collection. I finished both \\"hefty\\" books mind you in a little less than a week, yeah its that good. I can't wait to get into book 3 & 4 and because the set came in paperback I have to wait for book 5 to come out in paperback as well. I read a few reviews and can agree on most everything but I've become so invested into the characters (who died & alive) I must read on to see what happens next. This is a great medieval soap opera where no one is safe. The intrigue, schemes, plotting, deaths, twists & turns keeps me reading on. There are still a few questions I have on some of the things that are left up in the air but I'm assuming at some point Martin will find a way to give a resolution to it (i.e., where the hell is Arry's wolf?).<br /><br />I give this series five stars and love every little detail and all the ups, downs, sorrows, tragedy, wins and so on.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is all I can say about this novel, as I do not want to spoil a thing.<br /><br />Through these pages, I visited The Night Circus, it all became real to me.<br />Every tent I saw, the performers I knew along with there stories of how they came to be.<br />I will never forget visiting The Night Circus, and yes even though it was only through pages I truly believe I was there.<br />Thank-you, for letting me purchase this book, my ticket inside, Erin Morgenstern.

B00722ZIBA|5.0|It's pretty amazing that Incognito can release music of this caliber so frequently.  As much of a fan as I am, I'm willing to admit that some of their recent releases haven't quite grabbed me the way their older material has.  This one, however... this is a return to form.  Full of those trademark Incognito grooves, inimitable guest vocalists and just fantastic musicianship all around, I can honestly say there's not a bad track on this album.  My personal favorite is \\"Above the Night,\\" which has been on repeat the past couple of days-- my coworkers hate me!  Awesome stuff.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its interesting game but everyone has diff thoughts but I like it if not just delete it and its Mindanao like Mario type of game.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|kind of a rip. only two worlds for2.99 on the kindle fire.<br />i finished in a little over an hour.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a wonderful game, but is a thinker, not a nail-biter.  The interface is extremely well thought out and works almost flawlessly.  I had one force close early on in the game, but haven't had one since so I guess it was an anomaly (playing on a Xoom tablet running ICS).<br /><br />The puzzles start out extremely easy and get harder, but very slowly (I've been playing for maybe an hour over the last few days and I've made it through 1941, which appears to be half-way, with a perfect score and used only one hint, 162/48).  I love that the game has multiple profiles, why can't more games do that (so that I can easily share these wonderful thinking games on the tablet with my 8-year-old son without frustrating him).  The sound effects are subtle and unobtrusive.<br /><br />Almost took away one star for nagging me to review the game.<br /><br />All-in-all well worth the $1.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|The acting was a little off, but going in knowing that theyre real SEALS, I expected a little lack in skill.

I'll be purchasing the blu ray.  Ive heard its basically a recruiting video, but I love war films and documentaries and this fits in that shelf in my home!

1400052181|3.0|I am not sure what inspired me to pick this book up from the Express shelf in the library when I went in to pick up another reserved book.  I always browse the express shelves to see if there are any of the latest releases that I really want to read right now.  Perhaps I had heard about this book or seen a review on one of my bookgroup forums or the cover just attracted me, but whatever it was I just could not remember but I knew I wanted to read it!<br /><br />One fact about me to start is that I much prefer to read Fiction books so when this book started with the words \\" This book is a work of non-fiction\\" it almost put me off reading it altogether.  However, I thought the subject matter being such that it might help me to partially understand my Husbands industry and make some informed small talk with his work colleagues kept me reading on.  I am very glad I did.<br /><br />The author made some very technical subjects understandable and approachable, going into just the right amount of detail about cells, DNA, cancer and so on without dumbing it down too much.  She also made it a very readable science book by interlinking the science with the real story of a very real family.  The human interest factor lets the reader suspend the idea that one is reading, basically, a science book, and lets one seem to be reading a fictional story.  This is what kept me reading and ploughing through all the scientific terminology.  However, I felt the author took the family story a bit too far and made it to much of the book.  It felt like she lost some of her independence and became too personally involved with the family which meant, at times, she lost her objectivity on the matter.  Her writing style flowed very well and did not patronize the reader at any time.<br /><br />Don't let this put you off as it was a good story, an interesting science lesson and left me with a number of questions regarding the moral and ethical use of human cells for scientific experimentation without the fully informed consent of the \\"donor\\".  I am not sure what my opinion is as I have pro and con arguments for both sides of the debate (I guess that comes from being married to a Scientist and a Salesman!).  It also left me with a big question as to the whereabouts of my baby's placenta (although as my husband points out, in my case it wasn't left in much of a state to be collected after being splattered all over the doctor and floor in the delivery and operation room).<br /><br />A good book should always open your mind up to different topics and lead you to questions areas that you would not normally even have heard of, and this book definitely delivered on that.<br /><br />I would give this 3.5 stars out of 5 if I could.<br /><br />H Xxut the fully informed consent of the \\"donor\\".

B0059XTUB8|5.0|When the making and casting of MY WEEK WITH MARILYN was announced there was much debate over the casting of Michelle Williams as Marilyn.  Marilyn Monroe who if you really study her film work was a very good actress is instead remembered moreso for the amazing aura about her.  She represented sexuality, sensuality, innocence, vulnerabilty all at the same time with an incomparable beauty and presence never seen since.  So people with this film were basing the casting on who looked more like Marilyn.  Luckily that is not how the producers of the film proceeded for it is the inner essence of Marilyn that made her who she was and a great actress is needed for that.  And today in film there is no greater actress than Michelle Williams.<br /><br />They did a very good job in making her look like Marilyn but Williams went so much deeper and made her performance in no way a mere caricature.  She tapped into the pure soul and spirit of what was Marilyn.  The film takes place over a brief period when Marilyn was filming THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL.  This was a film when she was on husband # 3, Arthur Miller and sadly she didn't have much longer to live.  The film in and of itself is a pretty simple story.  The acting is very good all around but it plays as a slice of life piece except for the performance of Michelle Williams.  When she made her first appearance in the film I was comparing her to Marilyn but as the film went on I totally stopped and when the film was over it stayed on my mind for days.  I am a huge fan of both Marilyn and Michelle.  I knew the full back story of Marilyn at the time of the film and I found the performance of Williams haunted me long after viewing the film.<br /><br />I really felt as if I had spent time with Marilyn Monroe.  Williams totally tapped into the insecurity, vulnerabilty, innocence and aura that was Marilyn.  She became her.  Repeat viewings of this film also help to see the greatness of her performance for Marilyn is such a strong presence that it may be understandably difficult to belive anyone portraying her.  There has never been a portrayal of Marilyn that captured her true purity and powerful presence as with Michelle Williams.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  Marilyn and Michelle got their deserved praise by this film.  View it and you will be enraptured by the essence of a legend.resence that it may be understandably difficult to belive anyone portraying her.

B0076UXKDG|2.0|I bought an aftermarket grip for my D700 and never regretted it.  I'm sure the same will hold for my D800E - whenever it shows up.<br />This is a plastic box that bolts onto the camera and holds an extra battery - what's the production cost - $20?<br />Come on, Nikon - don't behave like you are Apple.<br />The D800/D800E are great products with real functionality that will be used long after the i(whatevers) are landfill - don't kill your reputation by selling junk accessories for outrageous prices.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel can best be described like this- the first half of it focuses around nothing but sexual acts involving young college boys in Belgium attempting to score with the very attractive near-supermodel quality women that roam the streets over there (and boy are they ever hot!) and the second half is when the actual horror finally gets underway so we witness some gruesome cutting and chopping involving knives, chainsaws, and sharp blades.<br /><br />Some of the horror is especially disturbing in a mentally screwed up kind of way, especially near the end when the Asian girl gets her eyeball ripped off and yellow mustard drips down her socket.  Later on she realizes while seeing her reflection that she can't go on living in such a way so she then immediately jumps in front of a train and kills herself, shocking all the concerned people around her.<br /><br />The problem is that the first half is so focused on everything *except* horror that it might not be worth the wait for the actual suspense and horror to develop.  It's supposed to be about a twisted man who captures and butchers young people but... the storyline mainly sticks with the college kids and avoids any kind of compelling storytelling.  I admit it was sort of cool how the captured kids would scream and scream and yet, no compassion on the part of the killer would occur.  Oh, and without spoiling the ending, the gruesome, bloody scenes that take place then happen to be exceptionally low budget.  Not sure if others would agree.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad horror flick by any means, and I admit that because the women were so attractive I didn't mind the first half of the film at all, but those looking strictly for horror will be disappointed with the lengthy waiting period.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Cool game. A little different than the original but still really good and a lot of fun. The only thing I don't like about the game is how it takes so long for your energy to fully recharge.  But still awesome game and its free.

0439023521|4.0|Whether you are a fan of science fiction or not, I believe you will enjoy this book.  From the very beginning, Suzanne Collins introduces us to the future of North America.  Following an apocolyptic war, North America is now divided into 12 Districts ruled through by the totalitarian Capital.  Each district lives to serve the excessive whims of the capital.  In order to quell future uprisings against the state and demoralize the citizens, each district must send a boy and girl between 12-18 to fight to the death in gladiator games.  Hence Katniss enters the arena, as she volunteers to go in her sisters place in the nationally televised gladiatorial arena.  We are reminded of ancient Rome as many of the characters names are those of famous ancient Romans.  Katniss must rely on her wits, cunning and skill with a bow and arrow, as she seeks to survive the games.  Through the games, she also discovers the love of Peeta, son of the local baker, who has loved her most of his life.  Though the premise is violent and disturbing, the author artfully guides the reader through a realistic future world, to cheer for the protanist's success and survival.  If Katniss and Peeta are in love, who will survive the fight to the death?  In some ways, I believe that the author is comparing American or Western society to those of ancient Rome-excess, greed, violence, and using other people lives as entertainment (reality TV).

George has killed off most of the good characters and I really don't feel like getting invested in another character that may have been mentioned three books ago that I have no recollection of. The only interesting one left is Aria and you could write one good book about her alone. I do not care to wait eight or so years for the next book.

Seeing how HE played some of those fabulous Zep songs was also 'a gift'!  Learning more about Edge; and where he came from (and all the U2 boys) was very interesting - especially the school vid of them as teenagers.  Wow - were they ever ROUGH!!!  But lookit how THEY turned out!  Gives the rest of us hope!!!  Jack White I was not familiar with. (And thought him lesser - why should HE be here?)  But he kinda does (just) hold his own in here.  Overall: extremely, extremely well worth investigating for any Zep/U2 fan; and any fan of guitar in general.  ~BTFP.
B0030DL3FU|3.0|Amazon offered this Intel i5 at an unbelievably LOW Price!<br /><br />When I purchased this CPU from a Seller through Amazon, I was to believe that it was being sold from an individual, who knew the dangers of handling this, or any static sensitive device, with care.  He did not.  This CPU arrived wrapped in clear bubble pack, and placed in a clear sandwich type baggie.  They were all sealed with Scotch Tape©.<br /><br />Following my proper handling and installation, I had doubts that it would work at all.  To my amazement, the system booted.  I'm not convinced that there will not be problems later on because of deeply hidden interior damage to this sensitive device.<br /><br />The seller has been very supportive, and friendly.  I took the time to explain the proper handling and packaging of these types of static sensitive components, and he appreciated it.<br /><br />I believe that he will take this information to heart and at least handle his own chips and Motherboard with proper static sensitive procedures.<br /><br />He is a Good Seller, just misinformed, and untrained, until now.<br /><br />Thank You
B00008PX8P|5.0|Upfront: my big mistake was not reading the fine print and seeing that this was a PAL/Region 23456 vid and NOT a NTSC/Region 1 vid.  Big oops!  The only way I could watch this vid was on my laptop.  (And NOT my big screen :( ...)<br /><br />All of Zep's important periods are represented.  The 'New Yardbird' period doesn't really interest me - not a fan of raw blues (even filtered through the Brits).  The '73 / Stairway period I have with \\"Song remains the same\\".  The most interesting / exciting period for me was the last: 'Knebworth'.  I've heard so much about this period/these shows over the years that I've been dying to see anything from it (In my time of dying?)<br /><br />Seeing/hearing Kashmir live was AWESOME!!!!!!!<br /><br />Seeing the telly shows/gigs and how rough/abismal they were give new insight and perspective into the band's collective mentality and resolve to avoid the press in general (and why they were loathesome to do any of it!)<br /><br />Altogether: a must have for any Zephead!!!!!!!  Just make sure you get the correct type - NTSC (USA) or PAL (UK).  ~BTFP.

Tonight I watched the recap/update show of Revenge and there was a video of a song. I immediately knew that was the same voice I have been hearing on B&B.  The B&B song is Arms, Revenge is Distance.

193413712X|3.0|If poetry is the true voice of death, then Paul Harding has honored the grim reaper in his prize winning novel \\"Tinkers\\".  The cruelty of regret, the pernicious claws of memory, the longing for escape--Harding takes his meandering, reflective time with all of these cerebral products of a lingering deathbed, and more.  For lovers of symbolism, introspection, and nostalgia, \\"Tinkers\\" provides a rich journey. But look elsewhere for anything more linear, or prosaic.<br /><br />And therein lies the problem with \\"Tinkers\\"--it's hard to know what the author wants to do with it.  As he bandies back and forth between generations, telling the story of the life of George Crosby through the experience of his last hours, the author's inner Rudyard Kipling keeps popping up, disturbing the intriguing narrative and taking off down side paths that, while on occasion enlightening as to the characters, tend more toward the obvious need for him to observe and define time, life and existence through the poetic eye.<br /><br />Not that his talent as a writer isn't evident throughout this intimate, felicitous volume: \\"A wind would come up through the trees, sounding like a chorus, the breath of thousands of souls gathering itself up somewhere in the timber lining the bowls and depressions behind the worn mountains the way thunderstorms did and crawling up their backs the way thunderstorms did too...\\"  Beautiful, but speaking of wind, a little long.  This particular sentence spans the page, and loads of them festoon the book.<br /><br />Between pages of these reflections, and the central narrative involving George and his father Howard Crosby, a peddlar who moved  about the countryside with a sensitive affect that makes Willy Loman seem like high powered hedge fund manager, Harding peppers the story even further with extensive passages about clocks, George's personal obsession.  There are long exegeses related to the work of horologists, and the intricacies and sacredness of ancient time-pieces.  From all of this mechanical didacticism one imagines their lurks some major metaphor about time, and its links to lost people and a sweeter past.<br /><br />This is all worthy, and yes, poetic.  But in the end it gets in the way of a compelling narrative.  A sequence where Howard Crosby, in his futile, unprofitable travels, stops to take pity on a hermit by pulling the man's infected tooth, lacks the verbal decoration but brings an immediate tightness to the throat, the type of emotional response every author seeks to evoke.  But it has this effect in part because no sifting through meaning is involved.  The simple little story within the story told all.  Where \\"Tinkers\\" succeeds is with writing like this, where characters, rather than just die and ruminate, interact with each other, learn, and feel. This is where the work takes off, and earns its stripes as a novel of signifcance.

B002C6K7NA|5.0|In the late 70's a devastating plane crash snuffed out the young life of Lynyrd Skynyrd front man Ronnie Van Zant along with guitarist Steve Gaines and his sister Cassie.  That event was truly a Rock n' Roll tragedy not only for the fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd but also for the Van Zant family and for the music world in general.<br /><br />A few years later, in steps the short-lived revamped group of crash survivors calling themselves the Rossington Collins Band.  While they carved out a few memorable tracks, the audience still wanted Skynyrd.<br /><br />Back in Florida, a young Johnny Van Zant was belting out powerful Southern Rock ballads hoping to start a new chapter in the Van Zant legacy.  His two famous brothers, Ronnie of Skynyrd fame, and Donnie who was blazing new trails with his own band .38 Special, were becoming revered names in the world of popular music.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1987 and the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute tour.  The band featured not only surviving members of Skynyrd, but several new faces stepping in to fill the in blanks left by members who had either passed on or decided not to return for the reunion.  Since any front man would be unjustly scrutinized, there was no better choice than to look to the younger Van Zant brother who was asked to handle the vocals.<br /><br />Thirty years later Johnny Van Zant has made this band his own.  Having held the microphone much longer than Ronnie, he has not only stepped into some huge shoes but he has worn them until the soles fell off.  This band is different, having only one original member, but it is still carrying the Southern Rock n' Roll torch for a third and fourth generation.<br /><br />While the old songs are true classics in every sense of the word, the new Skynyrd band plays some really great music as well.  True enough, it is hard to compete with twenty or so songs that have been played over and over since 1978, but Johnny and company are not in competition.  They are a new version of Skynyrd with their own brand of music.  And I mean some &#34;awesome&#34; music.  God and Guns is probably their best album since they first reappeared in 1987.<br /><br />They are not a tribute band.  They are not a bar band.  They are a group of professional musicians carrying a torch for some long lost family members and they are doing a fabulous job.  Ronnie, Steve, Cassie, Allen, Leon, and Billy would be proud of this album and this band.  I wish people would give Johnny and company the respect that they not ony deserve, but have earned through thirty years of sold out shows all over the world.<br /><br />Maybe they do only have one original member but those who have been playing with them for ten or twenty years have done a fantastic job.  After all, how many members of the Atlanta Braves of 1977 are still on the team?  Do we still call the team the Atlanta Braves?  Great baseball is great baseball no matter what names are on the roster, and great music is great music no matter who is picking the strings.<br /><br />Thanks Lynyrd Skynyrd for keeping Southern Rock alive!eir own brand of music.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|It does everything I want and more I really enjoy it:) you can even make new eyes colors and take away blemishes!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This is a great adaptation of a classic story. I read Roald Dahl's books as a child, and though people often forget, movies based on books aren't always meant to be identical. While it may not mirror the book, the film is witty, entertaining, and the animation is incredible. As a lover of stop-motion, I was amazed by the texture and movement the animators and puppetmakers were able to create, the characters really do come alive.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of the director or his style, you probably won't like this movie, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its own place in the world. Taking it on its own merit, as opposed to comparing it to the book, it's an enjoyable movie, one I find myself coming back to again and again.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is verrrrry cool because its like Mario ........If you are a Mario lover this is the tame for YOU .........LOVE YA
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I was a little skeptical when I first downloaded this game, but I was delightfully surprised when I started playing.  this game reminds me of old-school Mario, and has a lot of great things going on it.  the only flaws are that 1.) there needs to be more levels and 2.) the levels get a little repititive after the 4th level or so.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story line it's thrilling and full of action,wish for it to continue for a very long time...cheering for the girl
0307956350|1.0|The idea of this book was very interesting and I couldn't wait to get started.  And I read it to the very end...and couldn't figure out why it had good reviews. There are multiple story lines occuring at the same time but with characters I didn't care about. It was not a plausible story, had very little detail to support the ideas and the author kept jumping around with story lines and tenses. It could have used a good editor, that was sorely lacking. I also felt the ending was rushed...perhaps a movie deal in the works? It was such a disappointment.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Positive thinking is an ascient approach to reaching goals fast and in all certainty. It's also the self boost to self believe and healtier style of life.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It reminds me of Super Mario which I love.  Very smooth game play.  Very impressed with the graphics.  Very fun to play.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|When I got this app it was fun but now it has the buildings messed up all running 15 days 18 hours and 31 seconds and it goes down. my farmers market hallways takes a minster and now its on the same time as above like everything on this app. my brow has the same error on his kindle fire as me
B000025L6U|5.0|this group of well midage twenty or so have put forth an unbliveable mix of sound expression from there music back - ground wow just total power of music flow buy this album!!!! thanks seller great deal too!!! for TOOL!!!!
B005HSL626|2.0|I got this game and the screen turned black every time I played it. Now it doesn't even work. Every time I try to play it it goes back to the main screen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun, intellectually challenging game with a twist on every level. nice smooth graphics and intuitive controls. no waiting for coins, no buying credits so you can keep playing... just an honest good puzzle.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|Seal came through again. Love the new arrangements of the songs. Sit back and enjoy. The second album is just like Seal I.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I havent been into Tull since the 70's, Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, A Passion Play, Warchild, Minstrel In The Gallery, and I stopped after Too Old to Rock `N` Roll, Too Young To Die.  I honestly havent heard much at all of the 80's albums and beyond.  But SINCE this had the Thick As A Brick tag name on it, I played it for a spin on Grooveshark tonight.  This is a VERY well done piece, well produced, nicely written songs, great singing by Ian, I really expected something second rate trying to do a sequel album decades later.  But I cant say anything bad about this album, great guitar solos, and the trademark 70's Tull sound it's all here.  I really wonder the dozen 1 star reviews what they were listening to?  Now I admit, this is no Thick As A Brick and maybe it shouldnt be called that.  But than again it's what got me to listen to it and probably buy it. I give Ian Anderson credit for being able to make a quality composition like this in 2012.  When I thing of all the great artists and bands who couldnt do half this good if they tried their best!  Jethro Tull is not my favorite band, Floyd, Zeppelin, The Beatles, Seger and others are on that list.  But this is a very good CD, surprisingly good considering the year we're in now 2012!
B005T87QCI|5.0|I didnt try it but I hope its good. I think its going to be good when I try it.
B006AN78XS|3.0|There was much to like about this movie if you appreciate art/history and humor. The future in-laws were hilarious, as was the fiancee and her obnoxious friend Paul. I was a little confused though when the main female character was suddenly time traveling and was aware of this...did I fall asleep? I either missed the point where she realizes what is going on or they did a bad job showing you this happening.
1451648537|3.0|An incredibly thorough book about a fascinating man.  I enjoyed much of this, but unfortunately not all of it.  The earlier chapters were the most enjoyable, we got a sense of the man and how his character was formed.  Unfortunately, after the first 100-200 pages, the rest was just not that interesting.  It was literally an Apple product chronology, chapter after chapter--the iMac, the iPod, iTunes, the Mac Cube, the iPhone, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />I really could have been spared much of this.  And there could have been a lot more interesting analysis done at the end of the product chronology, not the cop out \\"Well Steve wouldn't want me to say much, so I won't.  Here's his personal letter. THE END\\"<br /><br />It was a very interesting book, don't get me wrong.  But Steve Jobs is still looking for his biographer...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so cool..reminds me of the old Mario game.but better.keep putting games like this one on here thanks
B007SSDS24|3.0|especially for what looks like a relatively low budget endeavor. casting was good, actors were likeable, dialog felt fresh, the pacing was crisp, and while it followed the usual structure (5 survivors becomes 4, then 3, then 2, etc) it offered a few surprises along the way. it made excellent use of the Moscow location, and the special effects were not as cheesy as you might expect. worth a rental.

B002RI9X8S|5.0|The characters may be very simple country folk, but John Steinbeck creates personalities so palpable, that you crawl inside them and live their journey; you feel their trials and joys.  The journey through American country side is so rich in detail, that you feel like you're in the back of the truck, travelling the roads.  The strength of the human spirit when faced with such adversities, yet still managing to find joys and triumphs is truly indicative of the peoples of old.  The march over and beyond human souls by the 'big boys' is so painfully unjust, that you truly feel those pains and injustices and join in the rage against the machine.  Beautiful snapshot of the ability of man to endure adversity, and a terrible indictment on what the love of power and money will allow to be perpetrated on our fellow human beings.[[ASIN:0143039431 The Grapes of Wrath]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I find this to be a amazing game except for some very minor glitches but the amount of adds is ridiculous and can become very annoying
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|my daughter is loving this game. she plays it several times a day. says that killing the animals is fun.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I downloaded this app so I can read in bed at night and in the dark, but it won't sync so I cannot access my notes and bookmarks.
0307454541|4.0|Coffee anyone? I felt like I was on a caffeine high while reading Stieg Larsson's mystery/thriller novel, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. On so many levels, I found this to be a really great book, along with being an enjoyably suspenseful and heart palpitating read. \\"What was so good about it,\\" you ask... Well, I say in return. Sit down... let's have a chat... and let me tell you...<br /><br />1. First of all: I love every mention of the word coffee.. I love coffee, and felt it served as a healthy reminder of my need to quench the parchness of my taste buds.<br /><br />2. Readability: I welcomed the change from YA (don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the YA genre, though it was a nice change of pace to be outside of it)<br /><br />3. The characters: Let me explain. When I dive head first into a book, one of the first few things I look for are the characters and how they are described, their behaviors, personalities and how the interact with the other characters of the book. One of the questions I ask myself is: are these characters believable as \\"real people\\" or do they just seem like mere puppets being pulled by the strings of the author, aka puppet master. If the characters feel staged, fake, or lacking of true human complexity and yet simplicity all within the same moment, I completely disengage. When I'm reading, I look to connect with these characters. Identify with them. Does the character/person's happiness, excitement, fear, or sadness feel real/legitimate... I don't just see the people in Larsson's novel as mere characters inked across a page. I can see them as real people. Why?/How? Because I am conscious of the world I live in and see how people say things without verbally having to say them. Body language. Quiet facial expressions. They are words... or rather represent words. And we all do it. We all don't say everything that is at the tip of our brain. We have filters. Some of us don't say exactly whats on our mind in every given moment of every given day simply because we don't want to offend someone, or it is because we have built up walls around ourselves and are afraid to show our own vulnerabilities to the world. And Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, is one of these people. She is quiet, doesn't speak much, though through her actions and the unspoken body language, she communicates quite effectively her intentions. Long story short, I dig the complexity of this character and all the others in the book as well. They feel multidimensional... and it was simply refreshing to read.<br /><br />4. What Blomkvist, the journalist, represents: He is a truth seeker/crusader. A warrior for the people. He feels his duty, as a journalist, is to uncover the truths that scads of people work to cover up and hide.<br /><br />5. The Suspense: I love a good mystery. A puzzle that will keep you guessing til the end. This book will definitely serve up nothing less. Though the puzzle in finding out what happened to Harriet Vanger, niece to high profiled industrialist Henrik Vanger, took a momentary leap to the backseat while I, the reader, was totally wrapped up in the current situation Lisbeth was in with her guardian. This is where character complexity comes into play. There is more back story to her character, though you just can't get at it (at least in the first book). So you read, looking to know more.<br /><br />6. The Story: Yep. It's not your Doris Day, Shirley Temple read that will leave you unaffected and smiling, grinning from ear to ear. It's full of ugly things, though who said life is always pretty pearls, and pb&j sandwiches. Life can get ugly, and this book just openly talks about it.<br /><br />Have you read it? If so, what were your thoughts? If not, read it, then come back and let's chat. Would love to know your thoughts/take.<br /><br />**Disclaimer** This book has some scenes that may be hard to digest, subject matter wise. I would recommend this book to those who are ok with reading material that contains: bad language (cuss/swear words), sex, and violence.<br /><br />For more Reviews, check out:[...]r more Reviews, check out:[...]
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lots of fun. in some some ways similiar to Mario. buy you will be able to enjoy it! I give this a 5 star rating.
B00594XOZU|4.0|this app is wonder but it dose not work on kindle fire! if you could fix that i will give it 5 stars
B0055SWM08|4.0|Glad it was the free app of the day. I would have paid for it but love free stuff. Good game. Would buy it now that I know what it's like.
B0055SWM08|5.0|addictive and calming at the same time- love this app! great game play and many levels :) i definitely reccomend this game to anyone!
B0012YYZYK|5.0|when I bought this, I thought I was only getting a live performance of one of my favorites band, which was a good enough reason for getting it.  To my surprise, this is more than just a live performance of a very good band; it's a documentary/movie type treatment which makes this a very good catch in my opinion.  Sound and video quality are much better than expected, considering it was originally recorded on 1976 (if I'm not mistaken).<br /><br />I am glad I got this disk, as I like the band and this is something I will cherish for a long time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its like super Mario bros but on the kindle and when your bored you can play it because you don't need Internet in order to play. I know you will love this game more than me.
B0055SWM08|4.0|a little bit repetitive but still a good game a a a a a a a a a a a Aa a a
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is a great brain teaser. My wife and I love too play together. We recommend this to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Ia am very pleased with my Kindle as I am not well and spend a lot of time waiting in hospitals so the Kindle is always in my handbag . The hunger game is v<br />ery good reading and I would recommend it . I like it[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]
B0055SWM08|5.0|addictive and fun, the music is calming and helps me relax just before bed. love to see more games similar to this one. what else is there to say.
B000H3096A|5.0|Bobby Hutcherson was in brilliant form on this 1966 outing with pianist Herbie Hancock. His solo on  Hancock's \\"Maiden Voyage\\" (originally released by Hancock the previous year) is a masterpiece and his vibes have an ethereal but energised quality. Last track \\"The Omen\\" breaks the mood with some 60s weirdness on marimba. Bassist Bob Cranshawand drummer Joe Chambers provide solid support throughout
0061726834|5.0|Please visit my blog for more reviews! :) [...]    Delirium was a delightful read! I had just finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and so Delirium was a great book to read while I was in that \\"Dystopian\\" book phase (which I still am).  Delirium is set in a Dystopian future where their society believes that love is a disease that people can be cured of at the age of 18. Lena has just a little over three months before she turns 18, but she falls in love. She meets a boy named Alex who woos her, they fall in love, and then it kind of has a twist at the end... one that makes you go... \\"Wait! WHAT!?! WHY!?\\"    What I liked  I really liked Lauren Oliver's style of writing. The plot never seemed choppy, it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter which is always a plus. The plot is kind of original and I say \\"kind of\\" because it is a Dystopian novel and these kinds of novels always have something outlawed, or forbidden. The forbidden thing in this novel would be the feeling of love. This means that you are matched with some one who you don't love, and you will never love. They will be your roommate who sleeps in the same bed with you. When you have kids you will only be watching and taking care of them out of duty, not out of love.    What I didn't like  Nothing. I really, really liked this book.    How did I read this book  I read this book on my nook, but it is one of those books that I want to have in paper form as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it :) it's perfect for the Kindle Fire..... and it speaks.Very useful and easy to get right back to your markings you can highlight and mark where you were.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|this movie is just very average.  the story seems a bit forced many times and it tries to twist a few emotions out of you but there is never really any depth or anything to feel a conviction about in the story.  it feels like it's trying to push buttons from the formulas from other stories (wow, that was a mixed metaphor).  the whole hawaii setting never felt like a good match to me either.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I prefer this version of the Bible due to having the name different versions all a few clicks away.  And it's easy to flip back and forth between your favorite views on the same scriptures. It's definitely handy for studying and even while reading at church.  I haven't tried many other Bible apps to compare but I unquestionably recommend this one.
B004SRNH10|5.0|Makes apps that use it smaller and a faster download. I wish more apps used this, so my internal storage would be smaller!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|No problems with it at all, I love the color being that pink is a fav, i like that it folds back and i can sit it in the bed and watch a movie, don't have to hold it, so that is cool but overall I am fine with it! don't need a leather one! <3
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved reading this magnificent book by William Landay.  The writing was brilliant with a plot which kept you guessing throughout the book and making you want to turn to the back, which I did not.  It was a legal thriller and great literary piece of work.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all those mystery lovers out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't add much to all the other 5-star reviews, so I will just go on record as agreeing with most of them.<br /><br />I'm a bit picky and hard-to-please when it comes to fiction, and I wish I had a dollar for every book I put down before finishing because of uninteresting characters, stilted dialogue or an uninspiring storyline. I LOVED Wool. I sort of wish the series would go on and on. I want sequels and prequels galore, because I find myself browsing Amazon looking for something as imaginative and thoroughly engaging as Wool.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you want to see the movie...WAIT!  You have to read the novel, first!  Yes, the movie is good but the novel is SO much better.  The movie is not able to catch the emotional 'mind reading' that the reader of the novel is privvy to.  And get the next 2 books in que because when you finish this one, you will want to immediately order the next!  Thank you, Ms. Collins!
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|I usually read history or other reality books, but I wanted something light for the beach.  I was not disappointed.  This is the most hilarious book I think I've ever read.  You can see yourself, or someone you know, in her.  It was so good, I've read most of her books!

0062060562|1.0|Without a doubt, this was one of the worse books I've gone through lately....it was beyond boring!  I thought the thing would never end.  Actually, I was doing the audio book and when I looked to see what Chapter I was on, it said 10 of 11 or something to that affect.  Well....when it finished, it said, now Part 2 and I wanted to cry.  Do I need to say more????
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I don't understand why I saw negative reviews. This product does exactly what itis supposed to do. It was shipped on time, no problems, no surprises. Immediately after connecting my  card to the connection kit, the photo transfer started without a hitch. I was wavering because of the price, but decided to eliminate the chance of non-compatability in order to save a few bucks. Good choice.
B0055SWM08|5.0|totally awesome game. it was totally worth it. been playing this every chance i get rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|All I can say is WOW on the 3D effect.... okay so for a few seconds the guy in the blue shirt is blurry but otherwise the rest of the documentary was nothing short of<br />AWESOME!<br />And the Music .... forget about it..... GREAT BUY IT and get you one for your 3D TV
0439023491|5.0|After The Hunger Games, I wasn't sure how Collins would be able to follow it up. The book was so intense and jammed packed with action, excitement, heartache, and political commentary that I wasn't sure how Catching Fire would compare. After finishing it, I'm speechless. Everything in this book is more.<br /><br />Once again, I am struck by how Collins is able to pull the audience into the story with Katniss. While the story does not have the same action level as the first book, the political intrigue is greater and Collins sets you up to pull the audience deeper into the story.<br /><br />It is really hard to talk about this book and dissect it. It is as the name suggests, a catching fire. Katniss learns more about herself, the depth of the corruption in the Capitol, the oppression of all the Districts around her, etc. Because of the lessons learned and the development in the characters, this book was much, much deeper and had more impact to me.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|The good, the bad, the mediocre.<br />The good... I love Cassia and Ky, and of course, Xander. They are all still wonderful characters. Cassia still holds that strong persona with the innocence of a person raised in society. That's got to be hard to keep up with for two books worth of writing. Ky is open with his feelings for Cassia, and that is important to keep the reader connected and rooting for him in this love triangle. I did like the bouncing back and forth from Cassia's point of view to Ky's point of view. It is always nice to feel all of the main characters. Xander being part of the Rising is a nice twist, but because of this fact, there is some questions raised in book 1. Oh well, we can for sure let that pass.<br />The Bad... Some parts felt like they were really important, but not much time was given to them. Almost like they were moments that Condie felt were vital to character development but the editors thought were too cumbersome, like the quickness with which Vick came and went. You could tell that his presence was important to Eli and Ky, but he was such a shallow character (not as in he wasn't a deep character, as in he was underdeveloped). The same goes for Eli and Hunter. I'm sure Indie was an important character, but I just didn't care for her. Seems the only thing she was really good for in this book was getting Cassia from point A to point B. If you sat back and thought about it, Cassia couldn't have found Ky alone... she didn't have the survival skills. So Condie had to create someone that could facilitate those skills... enter Indie. Indie was sneaky, lied, flip-flopped wherever the story needed her... no sustenance. Hunter only existed to show them the cave. Eli was there for what? Vick was there so Ky had someone to talk to while he escaped? I just don't see what they really added to the story. If you are going to introduce characters, then they need to be more meaningful, I guess... otherwise, with no real action in the story, everything just seems un-monumental.<br />The mediocre... There was a lot of great story that could have been told here, but truth be told, I felt like this story was the bridge between Matched and Book 3. It felt like a very long transition sentence. Cassia got to get outside of society, found Ky, made a few friends, didn't really learn anything that she didn't already know inside of society, didn't deepen her love for anyone, and got back into society in the end. The end. Wait! What? The end? Nothing gained at all? She didn't learn any great big truths about society? or  Xander's secret? or ANYTHING important at all? She found the tubes, that's about it. And yes, the tubes seem to have the names of the people that are part of the rising on it. Yes, that seems to be important... but you have to have more going on that that in 350 plus pages.<br />I really hope that the third book is amazing, because this one was just 'eh. I'm glad I read it because it is in the series, but if the first one was like this, I would not have ever picked this one up to continue reading about Cassia's life. I hope Condie steps it up with book 3just seems un-monumental.<br />The mediocre...

0439023483|5.0|Okay let me get this out of the way right now.  Yes I saw the movie first.  There, I said it.<br /><br />Seeing the movie made me want to read the book and find out if the source material was as good as the movie was.  I got a co-worker to loan this book to me and I'm extremely glad I did!<br /><br />I want to compare the movie and the book in this review, so if you haven't seen the movie yet you may want to stop reading.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />What I really liked about the movie is how well it showed that even though this was the future and we have all this amazing technology, it is only available to the very rich and the people in power.  The rest of society lives in poverty and is barely scraping by.<br /><br />What I liked about the book most of all is how it really emphasizes how the lower classes really are STARVING.  They are forced to break the law by going outside the fences and gathering food illegally just to survive.  And I mean literally survive.  If Kat didn't go foraging and hunting her sister and her mother would literally starve to death.  The book shows that every once in a while the Peace Keepers (their version of the police) would come and pick up a body of someone who had starved to death.<br /><br />Also what's good about the book is it really delves into Kat's past, it expanded on the bread throwing scene in the movie.  What had happened, why Kat was out in the rain that day and what prompted Peeta to throw the bread to her.  In the movie it's barely touched on other than one flash back and a quick discussion of it.  The book also really shows you what had happened to Kat's father, her relationship with him and how hard her mother took it when he died and how it really was Kat who got Prim and her mother through the dark times and put food on the table.<br /><br />The only thing I kinda raised my eyebrow at and wondered about was the fact that Kat was surprised at all the technology that the Capital had and how she stated it all seemed alien to her, yet she was able to operate the shower, food maker machine and all the other devices without any problems at all.  However that minor complaint is quickly forgotten once the games start and tributes are thrown together!<br /><br />Unlike the movie, the book just focuses on Kat during the games, we don't cut to Haymitch or the Game-makers during the games or to any of the people in the other districts and their reactions, it's just Kat and her interactions with the other tributes.  Which was pretty cool and kept the focus on the action.<br /><br />The only part about the games that I didn't like was that they said that the mutated dogs at the end that hunted down the last remaining tributes were made from the bodies of the dead tributes that had been killed earlier.  You mean to tell me that in this alternate future we can bring bodies back from the dead and mutate them into a completely different species?  That's kinda a stretch even if we are like 80 years in the future.  Hell our law makers are STILL arguing about cloning and that debate's been going on since the 90's so how can we move our bio-engineering along that far only 80 years in the future?  Oh well it's no biggie, I can suspend my disbelief for this book :-)<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />So that's it, I really liked this book!  It was really really good and I suggest it to anyone who loves futuristic fiction, science fiction or drama.  Also if you watched the movie you should check it out as well!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really one of the best young adult books I have ever read! Caught by the story I read the whole sequel in less than a week.<br />Impressive how the writer stays aways from sex along all three books and still make the love story so appealing. It goes farther than just a young love triangle but rebellion, survival and compassion. It has a really great message behind. Loved it!
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game reminds me of bulldozer, it was on my first computer. but this one is much easier! I like the appearence too.
0439023521|5.0|Simply put, wow. I had an idea what this book was when I picked it up. A friend of mine suggested it to me, and I admit to being extremely curious about it. But, wow, knowing doesn't really prepare you for the book. I have a lot of thoughts about this book, but I'm honestly not sure if I could express them.<br /><br />The story was amazing and the plot was very well played. While I felt that Collins didn't hold back, it was easy to believe that the audience was following a 16 year-old girl. I enjoyed the narrative style she used and the POV. Using the first person present tense really put the reader into Katniss' head, as well as placing them in the thick of the action. Because of this, Katniss' internal struggle with the Games and her feelings towards Peeta felt like my own.<br /><br />It was hard to read about children being put in this God-awful situations and forced to become little more than animals for entertainment. Granted, I understand some of the motivation behind the Capitol's power play, but that doesn't make it any better or any easier. The horror of this misuse of children is then increased by adding all of the Gamekeepers' actions to increase viewership and sponsor interest. It really makes you take a closer look at our capitalistic society.<br /><br />The end of the book was no less then heart rending! Once the Games have finally ended, you hope for some small sliver of hope, but you are denied it.  This book definitely goes on my list of \\"The Best Books of All Time.\\"
B004EPZ034|5.0|My girls love Alvin and the Chipmunks. This was by far their favorite. We saw it in theaters and when it came out we had to buy it. They love Alvin! Great movie and great price
0439023483|5.0|I was one of those \\"never\\" people.  I saw the movie prewiews and Hunger Games did not appeal to me.  I came across a copy of the book because my boyfriend was reading it and he said you will like it.  I said nah but picked it up and I couldn't put it down.  I am not going to get into the details of the book because most people know the premise of it but I bought all three and am half way through the second one (dang work- otherwise I would probably be done with the series).

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really want to love this game, it's a great time passer and you get a good bit of games for free but, the controls are AWFUL. :( They're the reason it takes so many trys to complete a game because when you try to move, the game hesitates a second or two completely throwing off your timing. :/ Fix this and it will definitely be 5 stars to me.

0439023513|4.0|With Katniss' rescue from the Quarter Quell and the uprising of the Districts, I really wondered how Collins was going to wrap this series up. The book starts sometime after Katniss is brought to District 13. She has been there long enough to get the lay of the land, find her hiding spots, etc. After being rescued, left out of the scheme, and leaving Peeta behind, she is completely broken and fractured; a mirror of her former self.<br /><br />President Coin, the leader of District 13, and several other key members want Katniss to finally take up the role as Mockingjay and spearhead the rebellion. However, this doesn't mean being on front lines and fighting with the people. No, she has to become a TV star. Wearing Cinna's final costume, she must strut around with amazing engineered weapons and pretend.<br /><br />Most of the book is spent following Katniss wander around District 13, struggle with her role of the Mockingjay, dealing wit her feelings towards Peeta, and just trying to hold it together. Unlike the other books, this is not a Katniss we are familiar with. In a lot of ways, her despondence feels very put on a self-involved. In Catching Fire, she kind of struggles with the idea of starting this revolution; however, she seems to run from it in the final installment.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to say about this book. By far, it was not my favorite in the series. I felt how they handled Finnick's character was completely foreign to what we were shown in Catching Fire. I couldn't understand the willingness to follow President Coin when she seemed as corrupt as Snow. However, when faced with this rebellion, I feel that Collins is trying to broach the issue of war and what lengths people will go to. I find her commentary the strongest in the treatment of Katniss' prep team and the traps Beetee and Gale are creating. In an effort to overthrow the corruption of President Snow, the rebellion is no better. It is a slippery slope.<br /><br />All in all, I did enjoy the book. Wanting to know exactly how it ended, I was driven through it. My problems reside with the treatment of some of the characters, Katniss' despondence, and the treatment of District 13. In addition, while it does wrap up the story, I felt as though something was missing. I felt that Collins could have dug into things a little more deeply. But, as it sits now, I feel that she barely scratched the surface.he book. Wanting to know exactly how it ended, I was driven through it.

B0059XTUXQ|4.0|The Iron Lady, largely revolving around Margaret Thatcher's later years tottering around her flat (with bits here and there about her time as the most powerful woman in Europe) is a frustrating experience. This is not because the film is overall bad per se, but because the good parts (which shined) are so intermittent. There's no structure, no through-line, just an older MT hallucinating, stumbling around, listening to old records, then quick cuts to too-short sequences of her growing up, having a family, waltzing her way to positions of enormous power, bullying around her cabinet and foreign heads of state, and dealing with the risks of her economic policies. With a bit less present and a ton more past, the movie would be a formidable work of art, for these sequences are nuanced (if underwritten), and, if gone into in more detail, could have been fascnating explorations of how Thatcher the person reconciled being Thatcher the leader.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, however, is flawless, easily giving the year's best performance and fully deserving of her Oscar. She goes from wide-eyed optimist to strong-jawed leader to querolous octegenarian with consistent skill. About an hour and a half in the movie she gives her cabinet a power-drunk string of rebukes before realizing the consequences of her outbursts, and the sequence is a master class of emotion and subtlety. She is also wholly believable in the film's older scenes, and does not rely on the (excellent) makeup to transmit MT's loneliness and fading grasp on reality. I really cannot praise her enough.<br /><br />But too much potential is squandered here. Her achievements, and the enormity of her successes, aren't explored. The scene's during Thatcher's rule are too myopic to develop greater themes about how she feels about the changes in her power, and are instead only about how she felt at that moment. By the film's end, the only new thing you learn about her is that her husband was kind of goofy. However, I would have to recommend it, if only for Streep's superlative work.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this game. wish that I could get energy faster to keep playing without paying cash (real money) for it but that's okay.still enjoy playing it!
0439023521|1.0|To an extent, authors must write what the market demands. If it is gore, or hormonal tantrums that are in demand, the author must write about gore and hormonal tantrums. That's essentially what this book contains, together with a narcissistic depiction of luxury that neither the characters nor most of us would ordinarily have.<br /><br />Yet, authors have the opportunity to mix in a more nutritious message. I picked up the book hoping that in addition to the gore there would be a unique exploration of the circumstances of an America divided into an imperial center and colonized periphery. I thought there would be segues into the economics, the political arrangements. At least a shimmer of a coming re-revolution.<br /><br />But no, the only faintest allusion to such matters is a couple of sentences every 100 pages where a particularly adolescent mind thinks hissily \\"if only the capital hadn't forced us to fight\\". What a waste! Even a historical account of how things came to be that way would have been nice. But no, the sole focus of such an intriguing context is just a minimal excuse for a setting where humans kill each other for the entertainment of other human beings.<br /><br />The rest of the text is divided roughly equally into gore, and the most simplistic kind of emotional angst. The latter comprises of person A kind of being nice to person B and then person B feels particularly obliged to person A sparing their life for just a little bit.<br /><br />It occurs to me that it is nothing but an extension of the tabloid/reality-show fascination. The fact that it is<br />popular with current youth bothers me because I was kinda hoping things would swing back to better with the next generation, but part of me worries that they'd just love to have some excuse to watch some kind of kill-fest. And there's a lot of war going around already.<br /><br />Also \\"Peeta\\" - the most ridiculous choice of name in a novel with also a significant focus on food. Yes, all the basal instincts are covered and nothing at at a higher plane. The love story from Peeta's side is as sappy and simplistic and unbelievable as it possibly could be.<br /><br />One more thing, be prepared to develop a mild desire to eat rabbit as you work through the gore and sap.

B006H3MIV8|5.0|This album is a good deal even without the charity aspect.<br />It's sometimes nice to hear Dylan's brilliant songwriting come from less-grating voices.<br />I appreciate the large variety of both Dylan songs and covering artists. Some of the Dylan songs were new to me. This was a nice introduction to parts of his catalogue, but it means I can't really compare those to the originals.<br /><br />Most artist/song pairs are new. The exceptions:<br />The album ends with Bob Dylan's 1964 original release version of \\"Chimes Of Freedom\\".<br />\\"One Too Many Mornings\\" appeared on a couple of Johnny Cash albums.<br />Adele covered \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" on her album 19 and has often sung it live. (There's a live version here.)<br /><br />As for the pop star appearances: Miley Cyrus' \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" was a pleasant surprise (at least coming from her). Ke$ha's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\" was emotionally overwrought and largely acapella, which highlighted her whiny voice.<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of Flogging Molly for years; their version of The Times They Are A Changin' is a highlight.<br /><br />Pete Seeger (Forever Young) and Marianne Faithful (Baby Let Me Follow You Down) have aged but still pleasant voices. Age was even less of an issue for Kris Kristofferson (Quinn The Mighty Eskimo).<br /><br />Johnny Cash even makes \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" sound like a Johnny Cash song, as he did with \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" decades ago.<br />There were many other interesting different versions too.<br />RedOne's \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\" felt like a bland facsimile.<br />DMB's version of Watchtower almost didn't sound like the original.
1582406723|5.0|Even though \\"The Walking Dead\\" comics have been published for years, I hadn't read any of them until I learned about the AMC series that was being helmed by Frank Darabont. At the time, I still had this strange habit of wanting to be familiar with the source material before watching an adaptation on the screen. I've never been a huge fan of the horror genre, but at the time I was on a bit of a horror-kick and had just read a bunch of the old EC Comics as well as Stephen King's nonfiction horror treatise, DANSE MACABRE. That's the state of mind I was in when I first read THE WALKING DEAD, VOLUME 1: DAYS GONE BYE. However, even if I hadn't been on a horror-kick, I think I would have found the book fascinating because of the fascinating premise and the great storytelling.<br /><br />THE WALKING DEAD, VOLUME 1: DAYS GONE BYE follows Southern police officer Rick Grimes. Rick was involved in a traffic job gone bad and ended up in the hospital in a coma because of it. When he awakens, he finds that the hospital is deserted. There's no one around. There are several dead bodies and half eaten corpses, but no people. Oh, and the cafeteria is full of zombies. While facing the shock of the situation he's in, Rick discovers that his family is missing and other than a bunch of zombies, the town is deserted. After being knocked unconscious by a squatter living in his neighbor's house, the events of how the world changed are revealed to Rick. A zombie infection has swept the world and the walking dead now rule. Most people in the area fled to Atlanta where the government said they would be safe. Rick travels to Atlanta to seek his family and discover if they are still alive.<br /><br />Usually, even the most-clich&eacute;-riddled zombie story can be entertaining; there's nothing quite like reading about or watching a group of survivors trying to fend off a massive horde of the undead. However, THE WALKING DEAD really isn't about zombies. The series is about the normal humans and how they react to the horrible extraordinary circumstances around them. A zombie apocalypse is a very extreme situation. It allows for both the best and the worst of humanity to be displayed. DAYS GONE BYE is a perfect example of that. Rick literally awakens to a world gone mad; the citizens he risked his life protecting before he went into a coma are now trying to kill him and eat his internal organs. His wife and son are missing and other than a vague heading, he doesn't know where they've gone. In DAYS GONE BYE, Rick is an example of the best that is in humanity. It remains to be seen how the constant strain will affect Rick. Also, DAYS GONE BYE doesn't even touch how such extreme circumstances can bring out the worst in humanity (from what I've heard, that comes later in the series). Despite these variables, DAYS GONE BYE introduces a wonderful group of characters and sets the stage for a great saga set against the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse.react to the horrible extraordinary circumstances around them.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I found the Game of Thrones Season 1 Bluray for about $40 less than what was advertised at Best Buy, plus FREE shipping!  I orderd the set on a Sunday using standard griund.  By Thursday evening I was entrenched in the saga of Westeros courtesy of the vivid imagination of a modern day American version of JRR Tolkien, George Martin.  If you loved this series, you'll find the treatment HBO has given to it is truly marvelous.  The guide to the histories of the houses was intriguing, but the best part was the narrarted animations.  Buy this set.  You won't be disappointed!

0345803485|5.0|I'm not one to leave feedback, I've only done it once before, but I just HAD to for this book.  I'm not a big reader, seeing as how it takes a lot to catch my attention.  This book has been an absolute OBSESSION for me.  I read the entire trilogy in about 14 days...I just couldn't get enough of it.  It's a very intense erotic trilogy, so if that's not what you're into, I definitely don't recommend reading this.  I thought the Dom/Sub thing was going to be more intense, but I was honestly a little bit relieved that it wasn't as intense as I thought it would be.  I'm completely lost now that I don't have anything left of the trilogy to read, and I'm honestly debating reading it again.  I love Christian!!!! (the main character)
0802136834|5.0|I received this book in great shape, even though it was used. This was a fantastic read. I never new that Henry the VIII was that cruel.I guess he would do anything to have his way. I wonder if all Monarc's are the same way.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|What can I say?  At first I thought I might be biased.  These guys are from a town just next door to me, which adds a level of excitement ... but I only first heard of them about two months ago when -- ironically -- a friend who is new to this area recommended them to me.  Another friend said, \\"Yeah, I remember seeing them play a show a couple years back.  They were alright.\\"  That should give you some perspective on just how quickly this band has blown up.  No slaving through local gigs for years, no grassroots following ... almost literally, they came out of nowhere.<br /><br />I'm typically skeptical when a musician/group rapidly develops a following like this.  But after listening through the album 3-4 times (and watching a few of their live performances), I agree with the crowd -- they have earned every bit of their attention.  They cover and explore more sub-genres than I could count, yet \\"Boys and Girls\\" is more than just a fusion of things that have been done before.  Brittany Howard is brand new.  And she confidently, and at times unpredictably, carries the weight of this album on her shoulders.  Seriously ... spend $5.00, be amazed.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"I Found You\\", \\"Rise to the Sun\\", \\"Be Mine\\", and \\"Heavy Chevy\\".

1401207138|3.0|\\"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\\" This famous Latin phrase from Roman poet Juvenal is often translated as \\"Who will watch the Watchmen\\". Well after reading this highly regarded graphic novel; NOT ME! At least, not with any great enthusiasm.<br /><br />Absolute Watchmen is the full 12 issue limited series released by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987. It is beautifully printed on quality heavy paper with rich colour in folio sized pages. If you're already a fan of the series don't even read this review, (which you won't like), go out and buy the hardcover edition because it really is beautifully presented.<br /><br />Ok, now that the fanboyz are gone I guess I can continue.<br />** PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD **<br /><br />The Watchmen series is a standalone concept invented by Alan Moore with the intention of using up the characters from Charlton Comics that had been acquired by DC. Not a bad idea I would have thought, since those characters were never going to make DC any cash otherwise. The problem for DC however, was that Moore's plan for these characters would largely ruin them for any future crossovers into their customary Charlton Universe: some would be killed off and others would have their characters besmirched. \\"So  what!\\" I say, but DC thought differently and Moore and his artist Gibbons were thus forced to invent an alternate set of costumed heroes to embody Moore's grand plan.<br /><br />This is the first of the serious flaws in this critically acclaimed series: The entire concept was built around a pre-existing framework and then that framework was removed. When you remove the entire basis for a book you can't simply replace it with another and hope it will all go swimmingly! The thing to do would have been to start again, FROM SCRATCH, but clearly the vision was largely set in Moore's mind by this time and so new characters had to be shoe-horned into the mould left by the old. This is too much of a constraint on the freedom of each new character to live and develop in their own way and so the characters lack the spark they would otherwise have had. Also, CLASSIC comic book characters, such as Hulk, Wolverine and Batman, are not easily invented, they tend to come one at a time and the dross need to be flushed away periodically. This generally happens over years and is the work of many artists and writers. No matter the genius of a pair of creators, they cannot create an entire milieu such as the X-Men or the Avengers from scratch in the space of 6 months.<br /><br />The cast of Watchmen are mostly dull and uninspiring, so let's have a look at the main ones:<br /><br />Rorschach, real name Walter Joseph Kovacs, based on The Question: Attraction to comic characters is highly personal and subjective and I don't know about you, but a Rorschach blot for a face just doesn't do it for me. Neither do pin-striped pants and a trench coat for a costume! Fail! Other than the visuals, this character is one of the more compelling, representing an uncompromising, solitary, inhuman, vicious devotion to removing \\"bad guys\\". Sadly though, despite Moore and Gibbons' attempts to fill out his character, he remains wooden and 1 dimensional. Better to have just left him faceless.<br /><br />The Comedian, real name Edward Blake, based on The Peacemaker, Nick Fury and Wolverine: Yes, another hard drinking, cigar chomping, hairy, muscular, largely amoral, womanising ape. The ideal of the US marine: a social misfit and loose cannon that the US government can unleash on some other poor civilisation to wreak havoc. This manifestation of the inner ape goes through Mr Hyde and all the way to Priapus. He is an ancient archetype and works quite well. He can hardly be considered original though.<br /><br />Nite Owl 2, real name Daniel Dreiberg, based on The Blue Beetle, Batman and Clark Kent: This is the character that the reader is most intended to identify with. He is thoroughly good but contains just enough weaknesses to make him human. He is middle aged, overweight and has lost the will to fight. It is he that gets the girl and lives happily ever after. Visually this character is ridiculous: a cross between Batman and a Beetle. After the original Nite Owl explains why he didn't use a cape we find his successor wearing one. The cape has no useful function however and is purely there to make him look something like an owl. The night vision goggles, though functional, simply make him look like an insect and really, it is hard to imagine how Moore and Gibbons could have come up with a less visually inspiring central hero. Internally he is extremely bland and I certainly didn't identify with him.<br /><br />Ozymandius, real name Adrian Veidt, based on Thunderbolt: The perfect human: genius intellect in all spheres, world class athlete, martial arts expert, handsome, learned, self-made, enormously wealthy and powerful. The embodiment of the Aryan ideal and the new F&uuml;hrer. Interesting that Moore should choose to make the perfect human the villain of the piece, but take one look at Moore and you can instantly see that he's a cynical old bastard. It's an interesting idea and in better hands could have really been something, but Moore has no real idea how to turn this into a living character and he remains wooden and unconvincing throughout. Visually he is also somewhat ridiculous, clad in his golden costume. Obviously it's difficult, (perhaps impossible), for a writer to create a character who's intellect and education greatly exceeds his own, and we see that here.<br /><br />Silk Spectre 2, real name Laurie Juspeczyk, based on Nightshade: A spunky love interest as required! Not a lot of character there and not a lot of costume either, so if you like well drawn, well built, scantily clad young women, (and what male doesn't?), she's your babe.<br /><br />Doctor Manhattan, real name Jon Osterman, based on Captain Atom: The only character that I found compelling and the one that I most identified with, but perhaps that's just me. He is the only character with GENUINE super hero powers, in fact his powers are GOD-LIKE. To Moore's credit, his internals are also god-like and he is never shoe-horned into a human personality. I read comics to escape the mundane, and this blue skinned demigod is only one that truly escapes.<br /><br />There are various other minor characters who are run-of-the-mill crime comic fare.<br /><br />Before I go on to point out further short comings of this series, let me put in a good word for artist Dave Gibbons, and colourist John Higgins. The art work in this book is truly first rate and if you like American comic style then you will find no fault here. Not every one can draw the many faces and body positions of a range of characters so that they are ALL convincing, but Dave Gibbons certainly can. As for John Higgins: The full page, full colour pictures of Mars are truly awesome and really the colouring is superb right through the book. Full credit to the guys! If I were rating this work on art alone I would have easily have given it 5 stars. It is often the case that main reason you read a comic is to see the visual art and that remains the case here.<br /><br />The second main problem with this work is the way it DRAGS. For most of its almost 400 pages it is little more than a soap opera! If you like soap operas this is fine, but I want a compelling plot and a lot of action! Watchmen does NOT deliver those for most of its time. Quite frankly: I can't be bothered with lengthy and ham-fisted attempts to flesh out the internals of a costumed crime fighter! Just leave it out altogether or cut it back to a minimum, because the characters generally only become more unconvincing and wooden anyway. 80% soap is 80% time wasted! I don't really want to sit through EVERY character's back story. It would be ok if it were done a little at a time and it remained only 10% of the total comic, but surely this must be at least 50%! Too much Alan! Boring!<br /><br />The third problem is the pirate comic device. No doubt this is supposed to be an inspired piece of devastating irony designed to cast a dark shadow on the nature of man and the futility of trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist... But... IT DOESN'T WORK! \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\"... IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK! All it does is confuse the reader and make him long for those panels to come to an end. Why didn't the editor step in at this point and point out the obvious? Even worse is when they combine real world dialogue and Black Freighter graphics in the same panel. It might have seemed like a good idea over a bunch of beers at Gibbons' joint but folks: IT DOESN'T WORK! Capite?<br /><br />There are numerous other short-comings of the concept and the writing, such as: the 1 dimensional knot-head thugs, the stereotypical film noir newsstand, used as a mundane counterpoint, the highly dubious teleported squid thing that kills millions and prevents WW3, the cheap motivation of the mindless mob that pointlessly kill Night Owl 1, the absurd scenario of Silk Spectre 1 making love to the man who beat her and tried to rape her and then never seeing him again... I could go on and on, but these are relatively minor gripes, they merely indicate that Alan Moore is just another hack comic writer who churns out 1 dimensional, unbelievable and largely boring scenes and characters, relying on a couple of brilliant artists to make his tripe readable.<br /><br />Watchmen does take you on a journey, but it's hardly gripping and the climax is VERY weak. If you like action hero comic soap operas then this may well be for you, but it sure as hell ain't for me. I give this 3 stars, but only because of the excellent art work, and the fact that although Moore's concept and story is poor, it is no worse than drivel put out by most other comic writers.<br /><br />I think I'll follow the one interesting character: the naked, blue Doc Manhattan, and depart Alan Moore's Universe. Take me back to Dr Strange and the dread Dormammu!me. He is the only character with GENUINE super hero powers, in fact his powers are GOD-LIKE.

B006ON41FC|3.0|I'm so glad I got this game. because its super fun and really addicting!!! Please get it! I love it!!!
B006WR0A8W|5.0|Ive bought tons of items at Amazon and this is the first one I've reviewed. Excellent product from every angle. First time I've used an xmini so I was very impressed with sound quality from such a small device. No question that it reaches my portable speaker needs. And yes, expanding the device does add rich bass.<br /><br />Add this to the Bluetooth capabilities and it's a real winner. Hard switch for Bluetooth mode makes it super easy to pair. No code needed.  Works flawlessly. Hard switch for simple control of device (play, pause, rewind, forward) is a really nice touch. Also appreciate having built in jack to connect directly if needed or chain to more.<br /><br />Ordered with expedited service and got it 2 days later. Very happy with this purchase.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Overkill should need no introduction having been around since the early 80's and releasing some of the best thrash ever and being one of the few old guard still going strong and never straying far from there roots. Records such as the years of decay and horrorscope still hold up today. I find this to be better than ironbound and the best thing they have released since horrorscope. The electric age is pure thrash with a modern edge. Bobby blitz's vocals sound as good as they did in the 80's maybe better and are for me are one of the highlights of the album. And the rythm section and riffs are as good as ever as well. Highlights for me are black daze with its groove and the best vocal work on the album. Others are wish you were dead a pretty straight ahead thrash tune with great guitar work. Old wounds new scars,all over but the shouting,drop the hammer down and goodnight. Any person who has stayed with overkill to this point can buy this blindly and anybody who is new to the band should buy this and find out what they have been missing out on one of the best thrash bands around.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This is a great game in my opinion i love thats its free there is a lot of levels to play and a nice variety of shop items thanks a lot gameloft :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|GREAT GAME!!! VERY ENTERTAINING!!!! EVERY ONE SHOULD PLAY THIS. GAME!!!!! DEFINITELY. KEEPING!!!!!! PLAY IT ALL DAY!!! YAY FOR OREGON SETTLERS!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app truly provides all the tools needed to read and syudy the Word of God. It is awesome because I can take it woth me anywhere I go. When I'm waiting to get my oil changed I just bring my Kindle Fire inside with me and read/study while waiting. Definitley worth whatever it costs.
B00669MFA2|5.0|Great movie, plus no more rental stores! We enjoy renting films off of Amazon on special occasions. We always find the movie we are looking for.
0307592731|5.0|This woman is so brave and inspiring.  Her book is well written and describes an amazing journey she took on the Pacific Crest Trail from California to Oregon.  From emotional pain to physical pain, Cheryl transcends herself and grows along the way.  It's an inspirational story that inspires me without being preachy. Love it!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I got this pair of headphones for running. They are comfortable and fit pretty well. The sound quality is fair at best. You can get a good amount of volume but don't expect much more than that. That being said, they work for what I need them for.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is a fun but challenging puzzler that is quick to pick up and hard to put down. with an inviting soundtrack and simple game mechanics that offer easy enjoyable respite from the over produced games of torque youth.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|The writers and especially George Clooney breathe new life into this animated version of Roald Dahl's book.  Animated in a sense but really old school stop-motion puppetry.  Foxie (Clooney) is supposedly retired from his wild animal days of stealing chickens and the like.  Unknown to his wife (Meryl Streep) he's slipping out with a new buddy and into his old ways.  A timid son and a nephew play into the mix along with a hoard of other wild critters.  The film moves along, has some interesting bad guys (human and animal), and provides the usual moral theme.  One thing that is repeated is...\\"these are wild animals and this is what wild animals do\\".  Nice flick by Wes Anderson; wacky and weird but not like his live action film which I have mixed feelings about.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|After reading the reviews for this I thought this was the app. I was looking for. I wanted a calender for my kindle. Unfortunatelym after installing it, I couldn't understand how to use it. Maybe Amazon could update with somekind of directions for how to use it.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|What I think we have to keep in mind with 'The Muppets' is looking at it in the context of its story.  This is the only Muppet movie I've seen that actually explicitly acknowledges 'The Muppet Show.'  To make this movie's story work in your mind, you have to imagine that the Disney-era Muppet films ('Muppet Treasure Island', 'Muppet Christmas Carol', etc.) don't exist.  The story is that, sometime after 'The Muppets Take Manhattan' (1984), the Muppets stopped.  So Walter, Gary, and Mary are trying to get the 'Muppet Show' era folks back together, as if they've been away for almost 30 years.  Hence why we don't see characters like Rizzo and more recent Muppet creations all that much (except in passing), and we really see characters we haven't seen in years!  Beauregard, Crazy Harry, Wayne and Wanda, Dr. Strangepork, the guy who hits the talking fuzzy head things with a mallet (name escapes me), etc.<br /><br />It's also told from the point of view of the fans - something that has, again, not been featured in a lot of Muppet films.  Most of the films involve the Muppets dropped into a pre-existing story as characters (Kermit as a sea captain or Statler & Waldorf as the Marley Bros.).  This film talks about the Muppets as \\"The Muppets\\", like a band we all used to love that we'd love to see get back together.  If you walk into the movie with this in your mind, a lot of the comparisons folks have brought up won't bother you.<br /><br />People have criticized the story as weak compared to the other films, but again, keep it in perspective.  'Treasure Island' and 'Christmas Carol' were classic stories in their own right with Muppets acting the roles.  The earliest Muppet movies had a magical cast of characters and storytellers (Jim Henson, Frank Oz, etc.) that you just can't replicate.  Don't get me wrong - the current crop of Muppeteers do a fantastic job, but if you're a diehard \\"Henson-era Kermit\\" kind of fan, it's illogical and unrealistic to think that things in thismovie will be 100% the same as they were in the '70s.  And who says the Muppets always have to be really deep, thought provoking, or ironic?  Why can't they just be funny and goofy and make us laugh?<br /><br />What the movie did for me was remind me of my childhood and watching the Muppets through my child's eye.  I loved them as a kid because they were cute and funny and cuddly.  I didn't realize until I was older just how clever and sly their humor was too.  This movie tries to do both things - hit the cleverness of the Muppets we appreciate as adults while reminding us why we fell in love with them in the first place as children.  From that perspective, this movie is a great delight for me.
0802130208|5.0|I fear, in an alternate universe, I may be Ignatius J. Reilly. Perhaps it is my Irish Catholic upbringing that leads me to believe, in my dark moments, that despite my good intentions, I am worth less than a small pile of flea turds. When it gets bad, I break out this book and give it another read. The laughter it induces is enough to bring me out of my funk, but I also realize -- Damn! -- things could be worse.<br /><br />Here is a man who is obviously smart and well educated, but unable to function normally in human society. It isn't worthwhile to delve into the reasons because we don't WANT him to be anything other than his dysfunctional self. This man's ability to inadvertently cause trouble -- which ricochets through New Orleans, usually to return at an order of magnitude greater -- is prodigious. You want to like him, but he won't let you: you are too modern and probably an offense against any criteria of taste and decency. If you want to get on his good side, be seen carrying a copy of Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, or, better yet, ask him about his trip to Baton Rouge.<br /><br />This is the only published work by the author, who committed suicide at the age of 31. We are only able to read it because his mother found a carbon copy of the manuscript in the trash. Others lament what we may have lost due do his untimely death. I am not so sure. It's not that I'm glad he's dead, it just presumes that he could have written more. Even so, should he have had a long string of successes, it would have lessened A Confederacy of Dunces, made it but one among many. Can't have that. This book must be a unique treasure.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|AMAZING GAME!!! Having lots of fun especially since I don't have to be connected to the Internet to play it only downfall everything is in real time so takes longer to get farther but all in all AMAZING GAME!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|Book is wonderful from beginning to end.  I'm not really into futuristic books either and I loved it!I even read it twice before going to see the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked the book.  It was slow in the beginning.  The End was great but very sad I was very sorry that Prim which was the whole start of the Hunger Games died.  Was very surprised.  Book was very good could not wait until I was reading it again. Hope for another...Because of my Grand Daughter Domo who assigned me to read all the books before the Movie came out, which I did but I liked the books better they left out one of the most important parts when Marge give the mockingjay pin to Katness....
B0048PU7TC|5.0|This compilation is missing a track. Look for Mike Patton's side project 'Peeping Tom' (self-titled). The song is called 'Sucker' and she sounds very naughty on it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very well written. Very informative about contemporary behavorial studies and marketing techniques. Helpful in understanding why I act the way I do. It will make my next trip to Target much more interesting.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing must-read for anyone who is a fan of science fiction. Beautiful story, immersive universe, full characters, believable pseudo-science.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game!!!!has every game...kids love it..its awesome to keep busy on trips and to keep the kiddos quiet...coins are easy to earn :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app gives full control of the computer, great for those times when you forget to do something. Also very handy for controlling media playing in a different room. Feature rich. Streaming speed fluctuates based on connection quality and ISP upload speed. Videos are watchable over Wi-Fi.
0307719219|5.0|Excellent review of the factors affecting economic growth and pertinent to the problems arising from the Obama administration.  Easy to read and understand.
B003MC5N28|5.0|A beautiful dystopian story that explores the way humanity defines itself. In 1984, we saw the limitation of language to narrow the ability for a person to describe their world thus controlling our ability to understand complex thoughts. In this book, we see similar lines of control and limitation. This book is absolutely a must-read.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Just downloaded this app and its pretty cool. It dies remind me of Mario Bros. So far good. Controls R simple enough.
B007R41E8O|5.0|this game is super fun! well worth the dollar so far....not very far in yet si see ya! I'm going back to play!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|leps world is easy to learn,  but it take time to figure out what you are doing Haven't got all the tricks down yet I don't think it will take too long. IReally enjoy the game
B007R41E8O|5.0|Kept me guessing for awhile.Well worth the $0.99 I paid for it. I will play it a couple times and then my grandson will want to play it too!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|this game around about level 12 gives you the objective to help out five friends towns. yep that means your have to try to get five people to start playing this game. also if you sign up for a gameloft account you will then start seeing ads in this game. kind of a turn off to an otherwise cute game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A game which makes you think, while keeping you entertained is a rare thing these days, and this game is joins the ranks of the few.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a great game. It is challenging but not too complex. It is a great game for the family or<br /> by yourself. It is a great game. I got it for free, but if it was for money, I would buy it.
B007OAAK0O|4.0|It's amazing this is getting released but when it was shown on ch.13 I noticed it wasn't the whole show. When I saw the setlist I was shocked that \\"Pieces Of Ice\\" and \\"The Prophet\\" were cut from the dvd. Not sure why but it's just a LIL Disappointing that the WHOLE show isn't released. That being said....<br /> Super glad that the 1st night is included in this released. After all... It's the most exciting one!
0385342063|5.0|I couldn't get through it fast enough.  Sophie's style and paving are exactly what I like in a book.  Her characters always are so innocent with such good intentions that they leave you feeling like you wish you had friends like them!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The game is fun and I have spent a large portion of the last several days building my town. Couple of things I don't like:  You only get to be 1 character. I think it would be neat to be able to switch characters and have several energy stores...especially since you have to pay real money to buy extra.  Also, the fact that you do have to spend real money anytime you want to buy certain things. Shouldn't it be enough to buy the game? Greedy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In a time where publishers get greedy and resort to price fixing, it's wonderful to know there are still some of the good guys. The book lives up to the hype and is a great companion to the movie.
B000VHXBIU|5.0|Saw this movie years ago, and decided to have it for my collection. It's still a great movie.  John Cleese and Kevin Kline are geniuses.
0805047905|3.0|This is OK for small children, but somehow I was expecting more from this product. Still I had good times with my kid and \\"Brown Bear\\".
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is good old school fun!!!  Can't beat it for a free game it is just like Mario Bros
1466216336|1.0|The cover is pixelated - should've gave it away right there. Inside looks like xerox copies of prior edition. Cant verify,but id this isn't bootleg... its a close as you get to looking like it. Great book, but don't buy this \\"edition\\"
0307352145|5.0|Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain<br /><br />Quiet is a book that looks at the world from the introvert point of view.  Susan Cain feels that our culture is geared more for the extrovert and wanted to show the reader how much of an impact introverts have had on our society.  Part one of Quiet explores the extrovert ideal and how the personality of the extrovert became the sought after type in modern America.  Part two, Your Biology, Your Self, investigates where introverts come from.  Part 3 looks at other cultures to see if they are extrovert dominated.  The last part is full of advice on how to love and work as an introvert.  There is also a chapter on how to raise your introverted child.<br />I'm an introvert so naturally I enjoyed Quiet.  I have grown to accept my introverted self as I have gotten older but struggled with it as a child and young adult.  I enjoyed the science of why and how certain people are introverts.  The author explained many different aspects from the introverted point of view and how the introvert's way of working, socializing, and living is not wrong, just different from the extrovert's style which is the more accepted way of doing things in Western society.<br /><br />A few of my children are introverts and reading this book has helped me understand them more and will help me prepare them for a successful adult life in an extroverted society.  Everyone has an introvert in their inner circle of friends and family and reading this book will help you to understand and interact with them in a more productive way.  I also recommend it to introverts as a fun and fascinating look at your personality.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received a free copy of Quiet from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group in order to write this review and have shared my honest opinion.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book. I love how it comes together. I wish E.L. James would have did a forth book because every time I get done with a series I get depressed lol.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|wow this is s must download works great. graphics are great. its kinda like super Mario. I wouldnof paid $10 for this app. but right now its free download before its to late
B006ON41FC|5.0|my 6 year old loves this game. it does not frustrate him like many other games can sometimes do. fun for parents too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice game, doesn't have all the hectic craziness that a lot of games have lately. Calming and makes you think.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I love these types of games, this one is the best I've played. The game is challenging and has a good 'hint' button that helped a lot and the graphics were very cool! only prob is that it would randomly go back to the main screen with the company logo and possibly lost the last few minutes I had played. Can be a bummer if you just did a bunch of steps. Also once you download it, it still takes a while to install the whole thing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love this game it so fun lol and its very hard to get the animals to die because they move so fast
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|fun game keeps you thinking kids love it as well. we enjoy playing paranormal agency as a family. matter of fact we have a paranormal night twice a week
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cant figure out how to get cash without paying actual money for it. if you buy the game you should be able to play the whole thing.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|sure its free but really? your going to rip off Mario, then go suck a... you know.<br />its pretty much the same thing and Mario will always own everyone... every one lol.<br />I guess its a &quot;ok&quot; game but I still give it a 1star<br />thank you, Shadow out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|no complaints. gameplay is a little confusing at first but once you get the hang of the first few games it gets a little more enjoyable.
B000FC12C8|5.0|A must read for any investor who wants to draw a line between playing his hard earned money and investing it wisely.<br />-<br />Un incontournable pour tout investisseur qui veut tracer une ligne entre jouer son argent durement gagné et l'investir judicieusement.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The only thing wrong with this book is you don't want to finish it.  This is a real treat for people who love well-developed characters and suspenseful plots.
B004EPYZPI|4.0|I have one technical quibble.  When you visit, as a lawyer, a client in the Los Angeles County Jail, you do not get a visit in a private room where you can hug your client.  Most of the time you are talking on a telphone through a glass window and if you are lucky you get a semi-private booth where you talk through a wire screen and all the other inmates and attorneys in the vicinity can hear everything you say.  You never get to touch your client.  The deputies are so freaked out that you might pass drugs or a weapon.  But let's write that off to dramatic license.  This is a good movie and highly recommended.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|After finishing season 3 on Netflix I started feeling withdrawal, mood swings, general irritation and I didn't know what to do. Then I saw that I could download season 4 on Amazon. My mind was blown by the stuff. I got what I needed and everything got better. This show has some kind of addictive quality and I finished the season in 3 days. Just try season 1 and see if you like it, if you do, my job here is done.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Great show but not for children. Lots of nudity and violence. Great storyline. Loved Jason Momoa in it. Looking forward to buying season 2 when it comes out.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is a fabulous book and a wonderful series. It makes you want to keep reading way after you need to put it down.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|This is a great album with only top selling songs -- it is a greatest hits album, duh. I personally like greatest hits albums, as they filter the filler songs that bands write just to have enough songs to make an album.<br /><br />If you are a die hard GNR fan, you're going to want all the albums.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I loved this game so so much because it has new birds like the ice angry bird. You shoot it and it ices up the whole part where it landed. I very much reccomend this game for people who love all the other Angry Birds. And is much more cooler and advanced than all the other Angry Birds.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Not exactly like the old game but just as fun. I am a mom of a toddler that enjoys this game. Fun to be had by all.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is awesome and is a five star because well, it is awesome. it is a great great great great great great.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|people will agree with me that the energy runs out to quickly and none of us ar going to spend real money on a game the game would be better if you didn't need energy and you could just play.
B0067LXQAW|5.0|This is a great CD from the Cranberries, they never fail to keep me wanting to hear their songs over and over!  Well worth purchasing!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a cute concept and fun to play..I'm always commuting so its fun to pass the time the levels seem similar just with different backgrounds though
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Cool game! I am glad they made an Oregon trail game where you are settling I always enjoyed the first game where you where traveling and this game is basically a second to that game. its a lot like castleville those type of games so if you like those games you will like this game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book,i say this is in the top 3 in my top ten!Now I do not know about other people but it is a good book to read when you have nothing to do,once you start it you can not put the book down! I say i hope you read it!
B002WJI63A|4.0|My 8-year-old needed a female presence for his large cast of Maria Brothers plush characters. The princess gets a tough workout, but she's still looking peachy.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Would you ever need a flashlight this powerful? Probably not. When you get it, will you regret it? NO! This flashlight is amazing! I use it for typical flashlight uses as well as a spotlight. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this flashlight is amazing and is brighter than I thought, despite my high expectations. You will not regret buying this flashlight. It is my second Fenix flashlight and I am very impressed and more than satisfied with this brand. Maglite was great, but Fenix is much better!
B004LWZW8I|5.0|go for it !!! this place has good quality movies!! and thats it no more really to say i have to right 20 characters at least lol
B00005KB9W|5.0|It may not have as many songs at the other live Marley recordings that are now available, but to my ears this single disc live concert is the best of the bunch. Powerful songs, as you would expect, and the performance of Marley and the Wailers is electric and lively. Great live recording, perhaps one of the best introductions to this great artist and his influential music.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the game is simple and addictive. the music is perfect and helps you relax and think about the solution to the game. can't wait to let my wife try it.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|im disappointed because the game is just a bore arena game, after continuous playing you need to buy in-app many things needed for continue the game
006197806X|3.0|** spoiler alert ** Let's start with the cover first. Quite honestly, I am not as huge of a fan of this cover as Delirium's cover. I mean, yes, the cover is captivating and all, but it just didn't grab me quite as much as Delirium. Maybe it is the color that is throwing me off.....<br /><br />I have heard many mixed reviews in the way this book is written. I thoroughly enjoyed the Then and Now parts, though I have to say I found the Now parts much more interesting. The Then parts were just monotone to me.<br /><br />If I really sat down and though about how long it took me to really get into the story, I would have to say about page 200. Really and truly I wasn't completely enthralled until the last third of the book. Maybe it was because I was trying to recall what happened in Delirium? See, that's the problem with books being released a year apart. I can NEVER remember what happened in the first book!<br /><br />I do feel like Lena grew more in this book. She is another kick-butt heroine, and I enjoyed her romance with Julien. But, the whole time I was aching for Alex. I missed him BADLY!<br /><br />The end of the book was the best part. Oh. My. Gosh. This cliffhanger is INSANE! I need to know what happens next!<br /><br />Spoiler-<br />Ahhhh! Alex is back! I think my heart skipped a beat when I read that. Now there is a love triangle! Man does Mrs. Oliver know how to get her readers to come back for more!<br /><br />Overall, this book was enjoyable. It was a little slow-paced, and lacked action for me. I did enjoy the romance, but need more! I definitely liked Delirium better. Regardless, I will be reading the next book
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It's really cool. It's like you can touch this part of the screen and then a red circle goes around and around these blue circles and then a green circle comes in and makes a snorting noise. FUN!!!!1!!!!1!!11!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|awesome game but sometimes it doesn't open, i tap the Icon and show the gameloft logo then the game is closed
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a killer workout but a great one.  Don't give up on the workout.  I've never done any activity for a full 30 days. Now just trying to decide what to do next.

B001GCUO5W|5.0|This movie captures your attention and holds it throughout the entire plot. It was well written and acted. My entire family thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|omfg this is the best.......I cant wait till I ask My dad for the film version of this game :D
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|Although Sound of Madness and Leave A Whisper are Shinedown's best albums in my opinion, Amaryllis is still a pretty legit rock album!  I like must of the material on this album, and it was cool to turn around and see some of it performed live in concert the same week, as they were in Boise, ID...fricken awesome show!  Pick this up...as well as other Shinedown workings, if you haven't already.  Quality rock!
B004GYNPL2|4.0|Syncing between devices to dropbox is a sinch. Good set of icons. Would be nice if could add custom icons, but i found it easy to manage many accounts.
0345803485|2.0|This book is poorly written.  So poorly written that it is difficult to read.  I had to skim most of it.  If you just want to read a book with repetitive sex scenes then this is a book for you.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Great product extremly fast shippment a lot cheaper than buying from the manufactur will use again for other parts when i need them
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I love comics, I'm partial to DC Comics, largely in part bc of Superman!!! I have really loved the latest Batman films, (5 stars) & now I'm extremely impressed with \\"The Green Lantern\\"..... I have my fingers crossed that the Superman, Man Of Steel film will also be a great one as well.  DC Comics Rule.
