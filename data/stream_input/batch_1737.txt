B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book proves a self-published can be as good as any book out there. The story was original and entertaining. I did think the author erred in having too many points of view in the beginning, although that is probably tied to the books originating from a short story. The book picked up once the true main character was introduced. I also thought the some of the character thoughts and descriptions of actions in the last book were overly drawn out, although some people may like that. That said I never thought of setting the book aside. The author kept me always wanting to know more...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|it went in a direction i was not expecting~and i havent picked it back up......but i will .....eventually find out where it goes.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|So I got this for a steal at 20bucks from amazon lighting deal and best buck I spent!!! Well worth the $$$. I saw Alien for the first time last night and it was amazing. The graphics are outdated since the movie was made in 1979, but this film is a classic. I can't wait to see the rest of the movies! The box is very high quality!!!!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Good successor of the Percy Jackson books. Waiting for the rest of the series t come out.<br />The other 2 books are great as well.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I have tried so many times to install.this.game. cuz it seams very fun it reminds me of this one game called<br />_&quot;Beuty and the beast(after getting marked)I WOULD LIKE SOME ANSWERS!!!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was a surprising selection for my book club. I had seen the movie years ago and thought it okay. The book describes a period of growing up in difficult times with wonderful use of words and descriptive phrases not dated at all. This is, yet again, a case of the original book being much better than the movie! It is well worth a visit.
0312641893|4.0|In this futuristic retelling of Cinderella, earth is on the verge of war with the moon, and a cyborg somehow finds herself in the middle of the chaos. I have to say that I enjoyed this book because Cinder was very much Mary Sue material, the author took her and molded her into a likable and sympathetic character that isn't such a special snowflake that the reader is left in a diabetic coma from all the specialness. Ms. Meyer has created an interesting universe and characters that makes the reader feel invested in the outcome of the story. The only thing I would have appreciated seeing more of is suspense in the revelations made to Cinder. The reader can see them from miles and miles out, which makes the scenes where Cinder is broadsided with these details a little cringeworthy if only because we've known for two hundred pages what is coming. Overall, Cinder was a good read.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Not that I wasn't expecting to enjoy the book, just that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Great read, keeps you on your toes.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game to play when you are bored.It is very fun.Play it all the time. I love it!
B0096I9UTE|2.0|My thoughts on the album is that it's not as bad as I expected it to be, nor is it as good as I wanted it to be.  I am not that huge of a fan of her voice.  I really thought Kylie Minogue was a one-hit wonder back in the day (1987) with \\"The Locomotion\\".  Then she came out with the song \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" in 1988 and I thought that OK, maybe she does have potential.  She topped the charts for a long time with that one, I think.  I didn't hear much about her again until 2001 with her son \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\".  Quite honestly, as much of a hit as that song was, I thought it was just plain annoying.  But then again, any song can get annoying after being played for the hundredth time in a given day.  So in all fairness, when I signed up to do a review of this album, I am coming from an already pretty biased background of not being a huge fan of Kylie Minogue.  I realize that there's something about her voice that I just don't like.  I think she's a talented woman and is considerably beautiful, I am just drawn by certain voices and styles of music.<br /><br />However, if I am to focus on the songs, I do like \\"I Believe In You\\", \\"Confide In Me\\", \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow, \\"Slow\\", and \\"Never Too Late\\".  \\"Flower\\" is probably the best song out of the whole album.  I have never heard these songs before so I am trying to give my honest review based on listening to them just twice.  I must confess this album didn't turn me into a new Kylie Minogue fan.  It's definitely meant for a certain audience and unfortunately I'm not one of them.  I am sure there is a huge fan base out there that will appreciate this album a lot more than I did.  :)  Sorry Ms. Kylie Minogue.  :(<br /><br />*This is a review post from One2One Network. I was provided with a copy of the album and I am eligible for a prize drawing. All opinions stated are my own.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|All the books were great! I couldn't put them down. The author ties all of the characters together in such a way that it makes the stories a must read!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|If you like Rod Stewart, you'll enjoy his Christmas songs!!!  Being a big Rod Stewart fan, I was pleased to see had put out a Christmas album & just had to have it & I wasn't disappointed!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book! Picks right up where the last one left off!!! Crazy ending but overall a must read! Can't wait for the next movie to come out!
B008Y1YJZY|4.0|This modernization of santa is sooo wrong. I witheld one star for it. I agree with grandpa, \\"what's wrong with going down the chimney?\\" Why must we have a logical explanation for everything? Why can't we just BELIEVE!..I am completely opposed to the idea of Santa and a million elves delivering gifts by 'spaceship'. Other than that, this was an excellent movie and I enjoyed every second of it.
B0098VXE50|5.0|I didn't know what to expected when i ordered it, i just liked the preview. The title does go well the movie but it can be called a sharp turn on the Disney version. Very well done though.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A very entertaining story. It was funny and heart warming all at the same time. The actors really played their parts well.
0307742997|5.0|This is my first Nesbo book and it ranks as one of my vest reads ever.I strongly recommend this .It is not trivial as some of this venue tend to be.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Its great. Options are the same as in desktop, so you know where everything it is. I'm very satisfied with this app.
B0090YHSFC|2.0|The penguins are adorable, but the game...not so much.  Like others have said, the game gets boring pretty quickly because you spend a ridiculous amount of time waiting for the penguins to get to the same side of the ice.<br /><br />I also had a little trouble getting the ice to respond to my slices once in a while.  I played the whole 1st day. The game has days you play through.  I gave it a fair chance, but I think this one will be deleted. I don't think even the grandkids will like this one because they will be bored waiting on the penguins.
B004ISVH6G|5.0|Kick ass compliation from a classic and classy vocalist and songwriter. From the rocking opener &#34;Rough & Tumble&#34;, to the voodoo undertones of &#34;Evil&#34; the heartbreak of &#34;If You Ever Get Lonely&#34; to the world-wariness of &#34;Love's Going Out of Style&#34; to the not-of-this-world &#34;Peace of Mind&#34; to the haunting closer &#34;Hanging Tree&#34; Waite proves once again he's not a man to be typecast. Great to see am artist of his tenacity willing to put it all out on the line in the name of his art.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|I love films where actors let themselves go and in this film Charlize Theron played a part that definitely was believable
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the one or three card draw option. Just plain good solitaire with an easy interface, too. Make more like this one.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I thought this was a great movie I can definitely understand why Michelle Wlliams received an oscar nomination for her work in the film
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is awsome but i cant update it this is probably the best mincraft game in the store get the seed app too or you have boring maps.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|For 30 years, Fix it Felix has been a favorite game in Litwick's arcade.  It stands with old games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, but also with new games like Sugar Rush and Heroes Duty.  Ralph, the villan of the game, has been doing his job all these years but no one gives him any respect or even seems to like him.  In a support group for villians like him (led by Clyde of Pac-Man) he admits he would like to be a good guy for a change - which of course scares the others and asks if he was going to go Turbo (the definition of this is when a character of one game tries to take over another and both games get their plugs pulled).  But when he is not invited to the anniversary party of his game being held by the other characters, this makes Ralph leave for the ultra violent Heroes duty to get a medal and maybe the respect he craves.  But along the way things naturally do not go as planned and it is not only a race against time, since Ralph was not in his game they are scheduled to have their plug pulled, but also for Sgt. Calhoun and a love stricken Felix (to each their own) to stop a Cybug infestation from destroying the rest of the arcade.<br /><br />I remember when I was younger and going to the arcade with my father with a stack of quarters and playing games like Mr. Do and Street Fighter, so I was happy that this movie gave me that bit of nostalgia for the old days. And<br />I will admit I was a little worried about this movie as other movies based on video games were not so great (resident evil being a prime example), but as I saw the trailers I am glad I got to see the movie.  The animation was clean, the story was well written, and the life of the characters from Venellope Van Schweetz to Ryu and Ken of Street Fighter just makes you wonder if the game characters do have an after hours life.  Also I enjoyed naming all the cameo characters that I knew (from Bowser and M. Bison to classics like Q*Bert and Dig Dug).  A must have for old and young people that when it comes out it is going into my collection of great movies.<br /><br />I'M GOING TO WRECK IT!!!!comes out it is going into my collection of great movies.<br /><br />I'M GOING TO WRECK IT!!!!
B000286RKW|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 50 times.  True stories, filmed in true location, are the best.  This is the story of Henry Hill and his life, as an outsider, with the mafia.  Superbly directed by Martin Scorsese, staring Ray Liotta as Henry Hill; Robert DeNiro as Jimmy Conway; and Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito.  I think the Academy Awards Society is still regretful that they voted \\"Ordinary People\\" as the Best Picture of 1990 instead of GoodFellas.  Joe Pesci got the Award as Best Supporting Actor.  Dialogue from the film is classic and quoted many times.  Period music throughout the movie works splendidly.<br /><br />I love this movie so much that I sent a copy to my nephew.  The disk was blank.  I purchased it on Amazon from MILA TECHNOLOGIES.  MILA kept my money.  Told me to go back to the studio where the DVD was made.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommend \\"GoodFellas\\", but stay away from purchasing anything from MILA TECHNOLOGIES.
B0007TKNII|3.0|Let me start off by saying that Phantom of the Opera is pure genius, but it takes the right characters to show the beauty of the story. I feel that the female role was flawless, but Gerard lacked passion. His words seemed falsified.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I feel like I really know Harry Bosch. I really enjoy these books and short stories. I have read several now and miss Harry when I am reading other books.
B00338QENI|4.0|I had no idea about Henrietta or HeLa.  Very interesting, sad and hopeful story.  I enjoyed the human story behind the science.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I don't know why I didn't just stop reading this book. It was like I really did not enjoy, but could not put down. It is a moralistic story and I liked the characters. Just did not like where it took us.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Could not put it down! Absolutely brilliant storyline and krrls the reader interested and guessing until the very end. Brilliant!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Okay I couldn't put it down, but if I had known the outcome, I would have never picked it up. I did want to talk it over with someone while and after I read it. I feel it would be a good book for a book club to read and have a long discussion about afterwards.
B0098460O4|5.0|I've always despised opera.  I am 50 years old and even consider myself \\"cultured\\".  When the opera ladies hit the high notes that screech in my ears.. (as we say in Alabama....it makes dogs howl over in Georgia)....uhh...hate it.<br /><br />Jonathan and Charlotte make me love opera.  Music \\"purists\\" will say it isn't \\"true\\" opera.  I don't care. .<br /><br />I listen to these two to go to  sleep every night.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|As so many others have commented, the original cable that came with my Kindle crumbled and exposed the wires.  This is the perfect replacement and, so far it seems to be a better quality.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is such a great app. It provides you with the ability to have your little book shelf with the note books you choose to title. The ability to also choose your notebook cover and make them into categories is very nice too. It is not hard to use once you get familiar with the features. The main screen where your books of displays allows  you to open up the ones you wish to use at that time. The font choice is nice very friendly. I have a few books for different things. I give this a five star and you won't be dissapointed at all. I use it for my dream journal, particular studies, foods, things to do book, and the ideas are endless. This is very nice many colors, and texture prints for the covers to choose from.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Typical Gresham with twists, turns and lots of realism. He sounds like he could have pulled this off himself in a former life. I enjoyed this book as I usually do with his books and stories. It's a fairly quick read. Nice way to spend an afternoon.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|One of the best, most imaginative science fictions shows ever.  What were they thinking?  This show should've run for 10 seasons.

B003QSMCKO|5.0|My daughter is 16 and this is still her favorite movie! We were happy it was available for streaming and worked well.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I love the ability to be able to make the promotional dragons trough breeding as well as buying. Overall, this game is great and easy to spend a couple hours playing. If you need more neighbors add me. KingKaos22
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Nowadays it's all about cherry picking specific songs from random albums to create your own personal playlists. Don't get me wrong, I love to do that but it is so refreshing to be able to just put on one album and be able to listen to it in its entirety. Dark Side has seen me through many pivotal points throughout my life. The range of emotion displayed on this album is beyond my realm of explanation, and quite frankly music this mind blowing requires no explanation. The journey that you take while listening to this masterpiece is like a beautiful, scary, mind-bending roller coaster of emotions that will leave an indelible mark on you for the rest of your life. Some many times you hear people say, \\"This was the music of a generation.\\" Well, Dark Side of The Moon is music for eternity because it will always be relevant no matter how much time passes.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite shows.  An amazing cast - love them all!  Have watched this show from the very beginning and never been disappointed  Highly recommend this show.  You won't be sorry you watched.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|CONVERGE CONVERGE CONVERGE CONVERGE! Oh great! Another Beatles box set, let me just add this to my 200 other Beatles boxsets. Beatles delayed a lot of good records.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Amazing!  I am still laughing  Have the first two seasons and can't wait for the next season.  A truly great cast!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|Basically, I agree with everything in jjceo's review. I expected something like the PC games Spacebugs and Waterbugs which I love. So perhaps my expectations were too high. This game is similar; but having to keep the critters on the same slice of ice makes for frustration and too much waiting time, especially in the higher levels. The power-ups don't help much because their time expires before getting a chance to use them. There should be no time limit on power-ups that cost dearly in game money. My feelings about this game are mixed. The fun in the first two or three areas in the daytime section gradually turned into more frustration than fun. The constant admonitions following a bad move are unnecessary and annoying. Bottom line - this is a good game, the developers just managed to curb the fun.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Amusing tongue-in-cheek version of the original series.  A must see if you are a fan of the original with a sense of humor.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was quite eager to read this book that everybody was talking about but was just so disappointed! It is poorly written with loads of repetitions and a very heavy style. The sex is nicely described but in the first book of the serie there is just too much of it. Still, for an unknown reason, a bit like for the Hunger games, it's a page turner; an ok read maybe for holidays?
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I too have all the seasons on DVD with the extended episodes. In want the HD version, but will not pay more for less content. I won't be buying until the extended version is out... If ever, as we waited so long for the blu ray release.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good writing and interesting story, but not quite as great as some of his previous books; hence the &#34;4&#34; I rated it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love decorating and surving. plus this is your kind of game if you love decorating and being the boss. you cook and decorate what more can you ask.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing, every chapter was a new revelation. Love her style of writing and actually just finished \\"Sharp Objects\\" her first book. Loved how Amy and Nick were like onions with so many layers of their personalities.
B009SPWWCM|5.0|I have all of the Neurosis albums from pretty much the last 20 years, and this is up there with the best of them. The dynamics and instrumentation changes on this album are literally breathtaking. I got chills. A fantastic album that feels a lot like a crowning achievement.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|It is though you are reading about your family history, American, English,German or immigrate, you are reading the history of the family we all are. Details of daily life for any of our Grand parents or Great-Grand parents, the love and hardships they endured.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Very exciting book!  Definitely keeps you guessing!  You have to read it!  The events that unfold are totally surprising and unexpected - love it!
B005LAII08|3.0|What a charming movie.  It was a funny story with all the usual laugh out loud and sentimental parts that Pixar animated films usually have.  Being a Scot living abroad it was also nice to hear a lot of Scottish accents together (even if some were a bit dubious) and even I laughed heartily at trying to understand the \\"Aberdonian\\" accent of Lord MacGuffin's son.  It also made me a little home sick to see the beautiful Scottish scenery reflected in this cartoon - there is nowhere in the world like it.<br /><br />My only concern about the movie itself would be that a lot of the humour felt very Scottish and I think it would be lost on your average American movie watcher.  The story was nothing special and there were several things that happened that were not explained.  Why a bear, for example?  Perhaps, I am just overthinking it a bit.<br /><br />I was also disappointed in the 3D effects.  While it gave the scenery some depth it felt as if the movie had just been an old movie made in normal 2D and then converted into 3D.  There was some scenes that could have been made more dramatic by using the 3D effect in a more effective way.<br /><br />So if you are looking to pass 90 minutes with a charming animated movie, then try it but don't worry about seeing it in 3D.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Although this book still involves attorneys and law it was a new twist to it for Grisham. OF course Grisham's books are almost always about law and the south He took this one in a different direction. I thought once or twice I had it figures out and learned as I read more that I didn't.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Great special effects, good alternate history, interesting twisty plot; I liked this movie so much I watched it twice during my 24 hour rental.  It's not your usual take on vampires, particularly their ability to adapt to daylight.  Despite some departures from traditional vampire lore it was well acted, and pretty well written; there were only a couple of awkward places that I noticed (like the dance scene with Abe and Mary).  The actor playing Lincoln is cute in his own plain way, the one playing Henry is hot, Mary Todd is pretty, and Rufus Sewell adds experience and name recognition (and his own good looks which have held up well since Dark City).  Honestly I'd rent this just for the horse stampede and the firey trestle scene sequences!  If you're up for a romp in an alternate past where the action is fun and crazy and full of surprises, give honest Abe a chance.  Just remember to emancipate yourself from your disbelief for a while.
B004FPJ87W|1.0|I understand that some movies are &#34;classics,&#34; but that doesn't necessarily make them good.  There were no likable characters in this film, no one to relate to, no story or plot, it's just following this womanizing guy in a downward spiral who goes around town in this nonsensical fashion meeting all these strange people that you never see again.  It doesn't make any sense. I guess it's supposed to be ironic--that what people think would be &#34;The Sweet Life&#34; is anything but, but I didn't need 3 hours of terribleness to portray that irony.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Thouroughly enjoyed the movie. The story was so well-written and directed, the concept was ingenious, the music was wonderfully done. I admit the acting part is not the strong suit, but it was believable and natural. All in all a great movie to watch. I wish there were more movies like it.
B000002GFC|5.0|A Must have for all Cream fans. Their very best songs from the early days. They were the true pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This was my first time buying a whole Mumford & Sons album although I had heard many of their songs before and liked them. This album is wonderful. Folksy and upbeat, but even the slower songs are beautiful and I have enjoyed listening. My favorite songs include Ghosts That We Knew, I Will Wait, Whispers in the Dark, and Broken Crown.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|This is a very good movie. Do not watch any trailer associate with this movie!<br /><br />Will Atenton quits his job and moves his family in a nice house in the country side to relax, to take care of his kids and to write a book. Once he moves in the house there are many things that go wrong and people all around them are really weird. Finally they find out that the house was the place where a father killed his entire family!<br /><br />At first they want to move out but finally they decide to go on with their lives, while Will tries to find out what exactly happened. He slowly gets it and we are in for a big surprise.<br /><br />This is a good thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That is exactly what happens when you put a good story and several good actors together. You get a good thriller. Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts are just fantastic. Don't listen to the naysayrs on this page. Just don't watch any trailer and go into the movie directly. You will be surprised.<br /><br />All the way to the end when you finally realize the plot.<br /><br />The end is...sad but unexpected. Pay attention to the details and the names throughout the movie! You will also understand why the police looks totally impotent during the entire movie. Useless like Will keeps repeating to them. Why the police is not helping?
B000I186FW|5.0|Exceptional film. It is a must see for all those out there who haven't blow up parliament..ehem...I mean fireworks on the Fifth of November. &#34;Penny for the guy...&#34;
B005LAII9O|5.0|This movie shows how you are going to make a lots of money without much effort, while spending it, and having fun. Eventually you will die, nobody will know you ever existed but you will die happy. There are dangers and ruthless people to avoid, but if you can make it you are good, you can get high all day long!!!<br /><br />Ben and Chon make the best pot on the West Coast and share the same girl friend (Blake Lively who is Ophelia, O for short). Elena (Salma Hayek), a drug lord from Mexico wants in and will do whatever it takes to take a share of their business. She is really ruthless while taking care for her daughter who is in college. Benicio del Toro plays the role of a ruthless killer (Elena's right hand man), but has two kids who play baseball. He beats his wife, and he kills people, but he gets really upset when his kids cannot hit the ball in a league ball game. Just your regular family man.  Dennis (John Travolta), the FBI agent, is so corrupt that he doesn't even remember what he says and to whom. His wife is dying from cancer.<br /><br />This is a good action movie about wasting your life. Five stars all the way for the acting, the casting, the direction, the music and ...the message. It is a movie that analyzes our society as is. Most people don't like it because they realize it is their life they are watching. \\"Savages\\" is the word. Just go through life. It doesn't matter how many electronic devices you have, how much money you have, how many good dinners (we meat) or how many girlfriends you have. We have regressed to the early stages of civilization. We are surviving, we are not creating anything anymore (at least the majority of the population). We have regressed back to a primal state of being. Savages...

0307949508|4.0|I prefer to read original language rather than translation, am suspicious of sudden hits, rarely read crime novels, and virtually never start a series partway through. In this case, however, I needed some thick travel books for a long layover, and I took what was available at home - the final two books of the Girl who/Millennium series. I'm clearly one of the last to read these.<br /><br />I have seen the Swedish film of [[ASIN:0307949486 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]], so I wasn't completely lost. And Larsson does a good job of providing necessary background in an unobtrusive way. Girl who Played with Fire was (to me) a pleasant surprise. Reg Keeland's translation of Stieg Larsson's prose is extremely readable. The style is short and to the point, and a nice carrier for Larsson's detailed but not florid descriptions. There's a wealth of information, but it's presented in a nicely organized, very journalistic fashion.<br /><br />The plot revolves around journalist Holmkvist's efforts to help colleagues investigate sex trafficking in Sweden. Trafficking in persons is a grotesque crime that few people seem to think about, and I appreciate Larsson's effort to bring it a little more into the spotlight. While his matter of fact descriptions of how it works were grisly, the reality is much worse.<br /><br />As things go on, the web of people involved grows and grows, eventually involving (of course) Lisbeth. Despite some descent into Swedish political history, and a large cast of characters, the book was clear and easy to read throughout. Even though it ends without a clear final solution, the end is satisfying.<br /><br />All in all, as you've no dount heard elsewhere, Girl who Played with Fire is a well-written, easy reading, massive book, and worth a look whether you like crime fiction or not.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I originally purchased this item for my Kindle Fire when my cat knocked my charging Fire off the end table during one of her nightly \\"race around the house\\" episodes.  Fortunately the Fire was fine (it fell less than 2 feet onto carpeting) but the end of the USB cable must have bent and no longer provided a good enough connection to charge.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this cable plugged in very snugly to my Fire, in fact MUCH more securely than the original ever did. The cable is also a bit longer than what was supplied with my Fire.  I was so pleased with the quality and length of the cord that I have bought a couple more to replace the extremely short cords that came with my phone, etc. They are great for times that you are away from home and electrical outlets are not always in convenient locations near where you'd like to set your device.
B007V65R54|4.0|Fantastic and quick read from a master of prediction.  The examples he provides support the content in a way that the text almost flows like prose.  If anything was missing, I would have liked a little more emphasis and description about the process for analysis.  In many ways, Nate provides great intuition for using a Bayesian framework but not as much meat around the details.<br /><br />Despite my desire for a little more detail, the book is fantastic and in many ways inspirational!
B005DI66N4|5.0|The  movie is an exciting adventure from start to finish. It also has a deep message from an old man who has been there and knows what happened. It also has a powerful and moving love story as a subplot. The locations are often breath-takingly beautiful. The acting and typecasting is perfect. In the end it is a tragedy set against a background of millions of lives wasted in the worker's paradise.<br />  The Siberian \\"work-camp\\" is 100% believable. It is simply a great movie which amost all viewers will find worthwhile and entertaining.<br />  The book is good too and easy reading. The movie of necessity simplifies the story a bit.

The story line was top notch, the game flowed flawlessly, and it held my attention from beginning to end. The only thing I hated was that it had to end. I recommend this game, as it is so much better then almost every game out there. To those of you who are more experienced at these games, make sure you play the more challenging game mode. Yes the hints take longer to regenerate, but you will rarely if at all need them and it is so much better without the game highlighting every important object. Trust me games are no fun if they are too easy, its way better on the harder mode. Enjoy!

B005LAIGRS|5.0|If, half-way through the movie, you were asked to name the director, you'd probably say \\"Tony Scott\\", so high is the level of violence, so non-stop is the force of the movie, which never relents with thrills and realistic hand to hand combat. Reynolds manages to keep pace with Washington and you would swear they were both doing their own stunts, so realistic are the fight scenes. The movie focuses on \\"you do what you have to\\" as the ends are used to justify the means. Internal corruption within the agency itself is dealt with that slant of deviousness usually reserved for foreign foes. A straight-ahead thriller which boasts an outstandingly professional cast, allowed to do their own things while obviously aware of and steadfastly following the Director's camera moves. Though by no means a \\"chick flick\\", women who appreciate the stark realism of the spy world, shoul be jolted by its violent spy-world atmosphere. This movie shall provide you with the escape therapy which very well made films provide.

B009AMANBA|5.0|As a reviewer sometimes movies are on the edge of a rating and you have to think was this movie a three star or a three and half star movie? Or should I hedge the bet and average it up? Or down? But Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" is unabashedly a five star movie!<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" isn't a biography of the President, but covers the time from just after his reelection up to his assassination. It focuses on his efforts to get the 13th Amendment to the Constitution passed before the new Congress is seated and the all the wheedling, machinations, deals, and plain old politics that went into the passing of the Amendment. The dramatic vote on the Amendment, which may be the second most important roll call in American history (next to the roll call on the vote for the Declaration of Independence), may also be the second most tension filled roll call of cinematic America since the movie \\"1776.\\" As the roll is called and the Congress votes, even though we know how the vote turns out, we're on pins and needles trying to figure out how each Congressmen will vote. Will they adhere to party lines, or will they crossover?<br /><br />Although \\"Lincoln\\" isn't a full blown biography (which are at best highlights of a life on film) we're able to get a sense of the man. Daniel Day-Lewis' Lincoln is a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and it weighs on him almost literally. Lincoln is also a man that loves his children, but has a contentious relationship with his oldest son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Lincoln's marriage to Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) also teeters from her being an astute political ally of Lincoln's to the edge of madness. Day-Lewis doesn't so much as turn in a performance or channel Lincoln, he seems to inhabit him, it was like looking into the eyes of Lincoln.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" also fleshes out the members of Congress that were important to the vote, and demonstrates the more things change the more they stay the same (they just had funkier facial hair then). That some of our `leaders' are truly that, leaders, while some have all the courage of the convictions of their party and not their own, and some are downright malleable. The ultimate lesson of \\"Lincoln\\" (and the Civil War) is that democracy and this country are what we make of it.<br /><br />The cast is a long and distinguished one, including David Straitharn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Tommy Lee-Jones, Hal Holbrook, Bruce McGill, Jackie Earle-Haley, and a whole list of instantly recognizable names some of which have carried movies on their own, and each turns in an excellent performance, which mostly makes the actor invisible and the character real as a human being as opposed to our history class understanding of them. \\"Lincoln\\" is Steven Speilberg's movie. It is like Picasso signing a painting. \\"Lincoln\\" is also a pure example of filmmaking. Speilberg blends all the arts and trades that make a movie into a seamless work of art.<br /><br />One of the marks of a great movie, book, or painting, is whether you want to see it again and again to see what nuances reveal themselves.  I want to see \\"Lincoln\\" again. This is easily one of the best movies of our lifetimes.ial hair then).

B00A6N7BS0|4.0|I enjoyed all 132 minutes of this film, although I was reluctant to rent it at first based on some of the negative reviews here.  It was one of the better films I've seen in a while. Without getting into the plot (do we really need long, amateur interpretations of the plot?), it was also better than what I expected after viewing the trailer.  If you're considering renting it don't hesitate.  I'm not recommending purchasing it since it's not the type of movie someone would watch more than once.  The entire cast did a great job of making this movie highly entertaining. The supporting roles played by Travolta, Hayek, and Del Toro were superbly done. Most of the negative reviews seem to be from people having higher expectations from Oliver Stone, or from having read the book, but I was simply looking for something worth watching.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

B009AMAKJU|5.0|Oh MY GOODNESS!! :0 This movie is beyond incredible!!<br />I absolutely loved it! I had read the books a few years back and was super excited to hear they would be making a movie for it. Admittedly, when I heard they were casting Logan as Charlie, I was not impressed and thought he looked too old....BUT then as I saw more clips from him playing Charlie's character, I realized he was PERFECT!! -I think that all of the actresses/actors from the movie weren't what I had originally pictured when I read the book, they were SO much better! This movie is one of those movies that is just like no other. There is literally nothing to compare it to, it is that great!! It is very very honest and it is one of those movies you treasure and love and show all your friends. This movie is about growing up and something that we can all relate too. I would suggest reading the book first, so the meaningful quotes, like \\"I feel infinite\\" mean even more. :] That's also another thing, this movie so closely follows the book, because Stephen Chbosky, the author, was also the director of the movie! :D I guess the only \\"bad\\" part about this movie is that it is over too soon :PP I wanted it to go on for at least 2 hours but its only about an hour and a half. But, overall, it is a gem of a film! Not to mention the music (soundtrack!\)!!

Capitalism at its best - doing the work of the devil.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|When this book was released I was put off by the negative reviews:  \\"Worst Jack Reacher Novel ever\\" kind of thing.  (Apparently those people forgot about \\"Running Blind / The Visitor\\" and \\"Bad Luck and Trouble.\\")  However, I finally picked this one up at the library and was immediately sucked in.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a slow build-up of tension, rather than the normal formula of Reacher rolling into a small town and beating up some yokels.  Maybe some people miss that part, but for me the change worked well.  And don't worry; there's plenty of action later.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|The dvds sets are great with lots of bonus materians and extended episodes, this bluray release just sucks.  i will keep my dvds sets for now
B005MQW5RI|3.0|It's an ok movie, a fun way to spend 90 or so minutes.  A good twist on the usual evil versus good movies where the Villain wins and then is lost without his nemesis to pit his wits against.  It is also a good moral of how even someone who has been created pure and good can turn evil.  The 3D effects are better than some other animated movies I have watched recently like Brave.  Not much else to say about it, other than it is offers nothing new from every other similar animated movie but it does entertain for 90 minutes
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I never read the books, so I have no idea how it compares. But, it was fun to watch on it's own right.
B005PV81MS|5.0|If you are a lover of independent, low budget movies, like me, then you will love this one.  It is billed as a black comedy but some people seem to mistake this for a comedy.  It is not Shaun of the Dead, it is a fairly serious movie with some underlying humour throughout.  It's main message is quite sad with underage boys having to fend for themselves because they have been forgotten and abandoned by their families.  The lead male has the attitude of a much older man despite being only a boy but he has not had an easy life and has had to fend for himself for most of his life.  You can almost understand how he got into crime and being a young thug and can even empathise with him.<br /><br />The aliens are hilarious and look like evil Furbies but I guess this is because of the low budget.  Don't let the bad aliens ruin the movie though as the story is not changed.  In fact, I don't think this movie would have worked so well had it been shot with a bigger budget.<br /><br />I am from Britain and have spent a lot of time working in and around London but even I struggled to understand the broad London accents at times.  However, the accents added to my enjoyment of the movie as it gave it an element of reality but I think your average American watcher will struggle to understand them.  Don't let that put you off as it is a movie worth watching.

B00887490Y|2.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />So in an old and dying mining town called Cold Rock, there has been someone or something taking the young children of the towns residents and everyone says this something is called \\"The Tall Man\\". All these townsfolk are the usual cliches and whatnot, the drunks, the small time diner owner, some mysterious suited guy who keeps searching for the kidnapper and there's Julia (Jessica Biel, \\"Stealth\\") who doesn't seem to believe the Tall Man tale. That is until her son is taken by him and she then tries to get him back and find out who this man is, if he's a man at all.<br /><br />The first 25-30 minutes of the film are the best part, there's the set up, there's brief descriptions from people talking about the tall man, then one night Julia wakes up and finds her son David gone. She sees 'The Tall Man' with her son on his shoulder and he runs off, she gives chase and manages to find his big delivery type truck rolling down the road. So she does the logical thing and runs after it, she ends up getting put in the vehicle, frees herself from being tied up and tries to choke out the tall man as he's driving with her son asleep at his side, which crashes the truck but this tall man still gets away with David.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie really goes off the tracks after Julia gets back to town, suddenly everyone is against her and she doesn't understand why. The film starts to layer \\"twist\\" on top of \\"twist\\" in an attempt to drum up continued interest, the false finishes and eventual \\"conclusion\\" are pretty umm.... bad shall we say. Biel gets props for playing a different role than she normally has as she wears virtually no make-up and gets beat up a good amount of the movie.<br /><br />The idea behind \\"The Tall Man\\" isn't a bad one and with some actual thought and effort this might've been far better and more interesting than it was. But sadly it goes cheap and basic with its twists and doesn't end up amounting to much, again after the first 25-30 minutes that is. *1/2 out of 4 stars.first 25-30 minutes that is. *1/2 out of 4 stars.
B000002KDG|5.0|A great album to sum up the Neil Young classics to date. We were really impressed not only with the catalog of classic tunes but with his lead guitar playing, something he doesn't get enough credit for.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />Starting in 1979 director Ridley Scott (\\"Gladiator\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"American Gangster\\") brought us a great and haunting sci-fi film known as \\"Alien\\", it took some set-up but there was plenty to like and the movie was a truly ground breaking experience and with the sequels in the coming years especially the follow up James Cameron directed \\"Aliens\\" this series is truly one of the heights of sci-fi film making.<br /><br />In \\"Prometheus\\" Scott returns to the director's chair to give us this story about events that took place before the first \\"Alien\\", it opens with some alien creature ingesting something, getting sick, falling apart and falling down a waterfall, then we have two people in Scotland in 2089 finding some drawings that seem to point to the origins of humans being created. Now we cut to a ship named Prometheus with a large crew, one of them not quite human who knows a lot about the ship and how the crew should take care of themselves.<br /><br />The crew arrives on a distant planet that seems capable of sustaining life, once they investigate they find giant stone faces and many things that seem to confirm that some form of life was here once. Well of course something is here and it begins to attack the crew person by person, so the rest of the film is the survivors trying to escape this planet and return home.<br /><br />Some of the crew have ulterior motives, mainly for profit (would this be a peaceful expedition if money wasn't a motive?) and quite frankly there's not a lot of people to root for. The cast includes Charlize Theron (\\"Monster\\"), Noomi Rapace (\\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\"), Guy Pearce (\\"The Time Machine\\"), Idris Elba (\\"Obsessed\\") and others, though no one really has a standout performance and just kinda go by the books.<br /><br />One thing I give major credit to is the visual effects and locations as they are both top notch, there is some good atmosphere and a little creepiness at times but at its core its mainly quite a dull and uninspired flick. This prequel reminds me a lot of prequel of \\"The Thing\\", in that it had some decent parts but mainly felt unnecessary. Scott is a great director but he has directed some duds (\\"G.I. Jane\\" and \\"Robin Hood\\" instantly come to mind, and while I didn't have great hope for this flick, \\"Prometheus\\" definitely isn't one of his better efforts. *1/2 out of 4 stars, simply for the special effects and sets.ainly quite a dull and uninspired flick.

B007K8ILUQ|4.0|I just watched the Blu-ray of Kubrick’s first feature Fear and Desire. It’s taken me 40 years to finally see this movie (which Kubrick himself had suppressed) and I have to say it was an interesting experience. It certainly has its flaws, but it is still a fascinating piece of work and definitely ranks as a Kubrick film. Believe it or not, it’s kind of a mash up of The Thin Red Line and a Twilight Zone episode! Much of the dialogue (which was looped) is stilted and the dramatic structure is clumsy, but as a first time effort from a 24-year old, it is quite ballsy. The cinematography is stunning, which is really Kubrick’s strength here. The characters are ciphers for the most part, and the acting is a mixed bag. Frank Silvera (who would later play the villainous gangster boss in Kubrick’s next film, Killer’s Kiss) does the best work, while Paul Mazursky is the weakest playing a nutjob. Kubrick certainly got better with actors and scriptwriting (a mere ten years later he was doing Lolita and Dr. Strangelove!), but this first film is very much a flawed gem. Perhaps strangest of all is that the film has a couple of optical wipes, which I believe are unique to the Kubrick canon. I’m guessing he had to use these to get out of an editing jam. There are no extras to speak of (a pity), unless you count the inclusion of The Seafarers. Too bad they didn’t get Mazursky to do a commentary! Curiously, his character recites material from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, which the actor-turned-director went on to make as a film himself 30 years later. Not sure what to make of that! All in all, a satisfying experience. I wasn’t disappointed.

B00942S4OY|4.0|I love One Direction and had very high expectations for their sophomore effort; \\"Take Me Home\\" did not disappoint this fan! TMH has a more mature sound with lyrics that showcase how much the boys have grown over the past year. This album displays how far the boys have come vocally since they performed \\"Torn\\" and it gives Niall and Louis more of a chance to show off their vocal talents this time around. TMH is full of upbeat, catchy songs and a few heartfelt ballads that make you want to smile and/or dance (although we all know that Cool Kids Don't Dance!) I bought the Yearbook version that comes with 4 extra tracks, 2 of which I really enjoy (Nobody Cares and Loved You First). Overall, there are no real duds on TMH, although there are some songs I do not enjoy as much as the others (such as C'mon, C'mon; Summer Love; Back For You; and She's Not Afraid - Yearbook version).<br /><br />I'm 27 y/o and I highly recommend TMH for all ages including young teens since none of the lyrics are too offensive in my personal opinion (there is no cursing and no overtly sexual songs other than \\"Rock Me\\"). 4.5 Stars!<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: Rock Me (such a sexy, mature side of 1D); Heart Attack (fun, super catchy chorus); Little Things (genuine, inspirational lyrics); Over Again (beautiful ballad); They Don't Know About Us; Kiss You; Nobody Cares (Yearbook version).

B004SBQGHS|5.0|This should be one game on your device.  The premise is simple, just pull back on the bird and match up the in-game physics of the bird your about to launch and figure out how to knock the pigs to oblivion.  Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a time-killer.
0375869026|5.0|I read this book as a readaloud to my class of fifth graders.<br />I could not have asked for a better audience or response to the book.<br />The kids, both boys and girls, were captivated from the very first pages with the author's humor<br />Then they were captivated by the story of Auggie.<br />There were parts that were hard to read, and more than once I shed some tears while reading it. But I think that touched the kids as well and they were quick to reassure me that other teachers they've had in younger grades have also cried while doing readalouds.<br />I just had Parent-Teacher conferences the other night and many parents commented on how much their child liked the book and how many of them have bought their own copy.<br />What a joy that was to hear.<br />I don't know if it was simply the make-up of my classroom, but it was a teacher's dream to get the response I did from her students!
B00992CF6W|1.0|why wont 5.0 update this oz wierd<br />because all of my friends with the ipod rendition have it but it hasent updated for the kindle fire.

B006S08RLU|3.0|I personally thought it was really great, but my boyfriend watched it with me and lowered my # of stars for the review.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Only ever read the shortened children's version of this story to my children in the past, loved the story line. Great to read good literature, still portraying solid values and importance of human behaviour and its effects on those we interact with. Also the pure delights in God's amazing creation as the garden begins to come to life alongside the children's awareness and caring, self less attitudes.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This novel gives a real look at the Navy SEALS and the reasons that they fight to defend our country.  Full of humorous anecdotes, I was thoroughly enjoyed as I read, and I am not someone who normally enjoys books about the military.  I read this book straight through, I could not put it down.  There are very few personal stories that touch me in this fashion, but this is one of them.
B00929G8SS|2.0|It just might be. At least LTH had a good B side. But this whole album feels as bland as the A side of LTH. Nothing really stands out. But ALL of the rest of their albums are 9s or 10s.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Don´t hesitate to buy it!!<br />Mark Owen´s description is remarkable and you can read this book instantly...<br />Marine´s commitment and dedication to their country is just amazing: My respects to all of them.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The price of that big blue box!  Yeah...my hat one! This movie came very well packaged and easy to open.  There is so so much bonus material! That's the best part if these bug sets.  The 3D disc was a bonus! I'm not a movie critic, so I won't give you my opinions on any movies.  I only speak to the packaging and over all value.  Thanks for your time.  Oh... The digital copy is awesome too!
0030565812|5.0|Definitively its the best biography that I ever read!!<br />Mandela describes a complex life in very simple way.. He´s just one of the most influential man in history and you will easily figure out whit this book.<br />Don´t hesitate to read it!!!!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Very good! The cord is bulky. The sound is perfect for recording, playing, or just listening to music. Nineteen, Twenty.

B0054SMID0|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer was suspenseful and surprising through out the entire movie.  I absolutely love Matthew in this!  Perfect role for him.  Five stars for sure!  Id watch it again in a heartbeat!
B008HK3RVY|4.0|Looked high and low for red colored kindle cases. Really liked this one. Good quality and sturdy. Easy to pack up and go.
B0047SF41G|4.0|This entry in the Predator saga places a varied group of human killer types on a planet being used as a hunting preserve by some Predators. I don't think I'm spoiling the plot by stating that much. If you came across it on cable maybe you wouldn't realize it was a Predator movie at first, but if you're finding it here then it's no surprise that Predators will be hunting these characters. If you came across it on cable though, you could be entertained by some really creatively dubbed swear words. You haven't lived until you've watched supposed badasses defiantly calling some Predators \\"mother truckers.\\" Of course, if you watch it here you will get the original lines which are not for young ears. This movie shows how a great cast can make a tired premise come back alive. Because, aside from knowing in advance that this movie is about Predators, you have also seen this exact plot and setting on the SyFy channel about a half a million times. Well, this time it's a lot more fun. Adrien Brody talks in a growl the whole movie and it's awesome. There's also Alex Braga, Danny Trejo, Louis Ozawa Changchien and a whole bunch of other people all being awesome. And Topher Grace, as an affable Doctor with a trick up his sleeve. And Laurence Fishburne, bringing the whispering crazysauce. This Predator movie is also a continuity nerdgasm of epic proportions. If you like the franchise, or like action movies, or like it when really good actors tear huge chunks out of the scenery and have to pick it out of their teeth, you will like this movie.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|I won't give away any details so as not to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.<br /><br />This movie is getting a lot of Oscar buzz and after seeing it tonight, I can see why!<br /><br />Ben Affleck is a genius. This movie had us on the edge of our seats, literally grabbing each other during the many tense scenes. I loved the comic relief in the scenes with the great John Goodman and Alan Arkin too. Everyone's performance was stellar.<br /><br />Be sure to watch to the very end to see the pictures of the real people portrayed in this excellent movie. Kudos to Ben Affleck on his performance and directing!
B004GJYR7I|5.0|For those who love Gary Grant movies, this is one of several best movies he has made, the other being North by Northwest.
0345525558|2.0|Though I enjoyed reading about how flowers have a \\"language,\\" that was all I liked about this debut novel.  Victoria, I felt was an unlikable character whose stupidity was not to be believed. OK, so you got pregnant, dumped the perfectly nice guy, hid it, didn't seek prenatal care, and chose to give birth in hiding all by yourself ... but then you don't realize you might have to buy diapers afterward ... come on!  Oh, and some food for yourself would be good.  After she literally starves and nurses herself to death, rather than seek out help from the kind midwife who eventually helps her birth, she leaves the baby alone twice, then dumps the baby onto the unsuspecting father.  Her stupidity was irritatingly excessive and unrealistic -- even for a girl who grew up in the foster system, which is no excuse. Two stars for a ridiculous main character with whom I felt absolutely no connection.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I still like SEASONS the best  but this is a close second.  I  love the characters and the sound effects. buy it!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Why I say that is because they doubled the prices of decorations in bakery story. Restaurant Story is o.k. but Dragon Story, man is this a cool app! I love the concept of breeding and evolving dragons. This app is a must have. This app is as cool as the dragons in the game! lol.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I got this on a recommendation from my sister and it was everything I needed a book to be: warm, funny ,witty with characters I cared about. I hadn't read anything by Jojo Moyes  before, I will definitely go straight on to another of her books. Sad, without a doubt but uplifting and beautifully written.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season one was the best new series ever in my opinion!  Season two bested season one!  Hard to believe!  Season three is WOW!
B008S4FZ6E|4.0|La storia dei duran duran vista da john taylor. Direi frettolosa forse mancante di varie parti della loro storia. Interessante ma sicuramente piu completa la.biografia dei duran duran scritta dal chitarrista taylor.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun and its free I could play it all day its really fun if u were to play it with firends
B004GJXQ20|4.0|it was very complicated at first but once the story starter it was a very good read. I am going to buy the next book now.
B004UID2LC|5.0|the app is awsome i download all.my movies and music plus its all free you can also back it up to your kindle or restore it its awsome
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Forget all the media, these books are amazing!! An actual adult love story! A must read trilogy. Stick thru it, book one is the hardest to get through, but worth it!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Very cute movie. It was something just a little different. Great to see some of my favorite actors plus loved the boy & girl stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The entire cast and all the episodes are here. Including two that never made it to the tube.<br /><br />Dam idiots, they screwed it up by canceling this show. OFF WITH THIER HEADS 🔨
B00005UPNK|1.0|I ordered this movie from you for a gift for someone. It did not or should i say would not play in their dvd player. I had to send my own copy which I've had for years to them. What do I do and how do I send this movie back to you or the person that did send it to me. I don't know if it was Movie Mars or what.
1401937268|5.0|These cards just ooze of love and light.  This deck is awesome and I always get detailed readings.  I can hardly put them down.  Doreen outdid herself.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|At first, I thought KFP would suck. But then, I saw it on the big screen and I thought it was just truly amazing! The critics were right! With a combination of traditional and computer animation and a stunning cast including (but not ltd. to) Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Seth Rogen, Kung Fu Panda is just awesome. 5/5! A great film that all ages should see.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As someone, who has always had a belief that this is not the only &#34;life&#34; we live, I was so impressed to read this account of someone, who is not just an intellectual, but a sceptic, and a scientist, his perceptions of life after death, having suffered a total brain shut down, have been completely turned face about. This gentleman is a Neurologist, a Surgeon, whose total belief was only in science and nothing that could not be explained by medicine, science, seeing, touching, etc. His account of what happened to him after his brain had completely shut down, and his experience of life after death is for unbelievers, quite incredible. The only reason I have not given 5 stars is because his medical language is hard for us mere mortals, to follow.
B00006HBUA|4.0|Being a Scooby-Doo fan since birth, I have always enjoyed the movies and the TV shows, when I heard a live-action version was coming out, I was excited, I was even more surprised when I heard that Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was gonna be playing Daphne. When Buffy first premiered on the WB network in the spring of '97, I knew from the start that Sarah would be the best actress to play Daphne Blake. Her future husband, Freddie Prinze, Jnr. (I Know what you did last summer) plays Freddie, Matthew Lillard (SLC Punk) plays Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini (Freaks & Geeks) plays Velma. The four leads portray their characters in an amazing way. I saw this movie with a friend and we laughed. If you love Scooby-Doo, watch this movie ! It's hilariously spooky!
B008YZXYY2|4.0|Just two years after Audio Secrecy, Stone Sour is back with their fourth studio album. If you don't already know, this album is one half of the House of Gold and Bones concept. The second half is said to be released around May of next year. If this is any indication of what's to come on part two then I say bring it on.<br /><br />The album starts off with the fantastic \\"Gone Sovereign,\\" which is sure to be a great song to start a live show with. It's fast, it's fun, and it's an amazing way to start an album. One of the things this album does extremely well is having the songs lead into one another, which is something you'll experience right away between \\"Gone Sovereign\\" and the second song, \\"Absolute Zero.\\" Now not every song on here is going to bleed into one another, but it is something that's done quite a bit on this album.<br /><br />One of this album's strongest elements, for me, was Corey's vocals. What I've always loved about Stone Sour is the group allowed him to truly test his vocal range. He can hit the highest notes possible, but then he can quickly switch into a deep growl. It's fantastic.<br /><br />The album is supposed to be one half of a short story, but I honestly didn't hear it. Don't get me wrong the music on here is great, but there really isn't a story going on. It just feels like a collection of songs they recorded. And I'm not the only one that thinks so, I've seen people on the Stone Sour message board that are saying the same thing. I just feel like musicians use the term \\"concept album\\" too loosely. Maybe it's there and I just don't here it, I don't know. I just decided to enjoy the music and stopped trying to find the story.<br /><br />One of the main complaints from fans with the last album was the lack of raw material. It seemed like they lost a bit of their edge, but with this release I think they're starting to get that edge back. Now the album isn't 100% in your face, but it's a step in the right direction. In my opinion this album contains the perfect balance of melodic and heavy material.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Gone Sovereign,\\" \\"A Rumor of Skin,\\" \\"My Name Is Allen\\" & \\"Last of the Real\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.5/10 - This album is a blast to listen to. Every time I finished listening to it I was walking around saying \\"I'm alive in here!\\" for at least an hour. It's definitely not their best album, but it's still very enjoyable and it's something I would recommend checking out.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Robots is an awesome movie, stellar animation, plot and cast make this a winner from the creators of Ice Age. Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor, Down with Love) is a wannabe inventor who wants to change society, and travels to Robot City to make his dream come true. But what stands in his path of success is a madman who plans to tarnish defective robots and turn them to scrap metal. Overall, an excellent family flick, and Mel Brooks' and Robin Williams' performances are just as funny as can be. 5/5!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Haven't finished it yet, but so far it has been a pretty good read. Not really a challenging read, but holds the attention of the reader.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great book. It was virtually impossible to put down once I started it. This story keeps you entertained, its funny, heart breaking and fantastically told.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|The great explainer-of-all-things-financial! Lewis has an amazing talent for taking these complex financial objects even regulators don't understand and manages to put them in layman's terms.
141659521X|5.0|I have read all of Vince Flynn books and was not disappointed with this installment in the Mitch Rapp series.  In fact after reading this book I have now promoted Vince Flynn to my All Time Favorite Author.  This book was fantastic.  I took my time reading and savoring each and every word.  When the book was completed I was bummed because I know it will be another year before I get more.  How sad for me.<br /><br />This series is fantastic and I highly recommend them.  Action and adventure that is A #1.  Mitch Rapp is my main man and the most interesting character I read about in all the series I follow.<br /><br />I have decided to start at the beginning of the series and work my way thru all the books again because I already miss Mitch and it's only been 5 minutes....Ha haha
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A few years ago, my wife and I went to the movies--only to find the film we wanted to see had sold out! Instead of hanging around for the next showing, we bought tickets to a movie we had never heard of called SERENITY. As we exited the theater, I said “That might be the best science-fiction action movie I have ever seen!” (And, as someone who has been reading &#34;real&#34; SF since the '60s, I don't think much of most movies purporting to be SF.)<br /><br />She not only agreed (and she is not usually a SF fan) but suggested we come back in a week and see it again. We did.<br /><br />Then someone told us about the television series.<br /><br />After renting it three times, we figured it was time to own the damn thing. It now ranks with NORTHERN EXPOSURE, ALLY McBEAL, and SEX AND THE CITY as her favorite series (and the only ones we own for repeated viewing).
096798467X|5.0|I was very happy to receive this book.  Definitely something I want to try next year.  Took a class at local museum in wood fired cooking and it is terrific.  Book is well organized, and descriptive enough so most anyone can do it.  Be sure to read through and take notes on what YOU would like to accomplish and success will be there!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As an Amazon Prime customer I got to stream this for free.  This preview to Series 3 contains enough to make viewers want to watch the upcoming episodes.  Too bad in the U.S.A. we have to wait until January!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|it needs more demo time its like 30 minutes or less or maybe more I don't know but its rely short.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|On this album, Lou Reed rants like a crazy old man. What he's doing on this album cannot really be called singing. He sounds like he's tripping balls and just ranting. This is what they were going for, and it's sort of humorous. I guess I'm one of the few people who like this weird little project, and I'm ok with that.<br /><br />Behind Lou Reed's crazy ranting, James Hetfield lays down some really amazing background vocals. What makes them amazing is the contrast to Lou's off-key craziness. It's this dissonance that really makes these songs shine. This album is all about the vocal interplay, and it's an interplay that's very original, if not universally pleasing. This dynamic plays out perfectly on the song \\"Cheat On Me,\\" a trippy little number that builds up nicely and really has a great groove.<br /><br />You can find many reasons to hate this album if you're looking for them. It's basically just a drunken jam session. But I think it's one of the most interesting things Metallica has done in a long time. I'm not surprised that most people hate it, but you can count me as one of the proud minority on this one.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Better story line than the first two books, but I did not like the ending.<br />Too much porn sex for my liking.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Oh my goodness, where do I begin?  I LOVED this book!  Now, to be fair, one of my favorite novels is The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton so chances were good that I would like her newest novel.  I was so certain that this would be true, though.  I've heard from a few people that loved The Forgotten Garden nearly as much as I did that they just did not like her first novel, House at Riverton.  So, when I saw that The Secret Keeper was offered as an advanced reader copy to reviewers, I accepted it with reservation.  I told myself that I would read it with an open mind (all the while being afraid that Kate Morton was a \\"one hit wonder\\" with The Forgotten Garden).<br /><br />Well, I've just read the last words within the last few minutes and I have decided that Kate Morton is one of the masters of stories that jump between different time periods and characters  (is there an official name for this?  I've heard a few:  dual story lines, the \\"two nows structure\\", etc.).  I love stories like this, maybe because as a history major, I love to see how history affects our present lives and stories.<br /><br />Anyways, back to my review...have I mentioned that I LOVED this story?  It is beautiful and it is sad...it is about second chances and love and mystery.  I couldn't put it down.  I had so many ideas on how the story would play out.  In the end, I was happy with how Kate concluded the novel.  She tied everything together nicely without seemed rushed about it or leaving loose ends.<br /><br />I've read a few poorly written books lately (some I'm even able to finish) so it's so refreshing to read something like The Secret Keeper.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Very good as all the Mission Impossible movies.  Tom Cruise does an excellent job as the main character with stunts that are somewhat believable or Not.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like nothing else Grisham has written.  Once you start reading, you can not put it down  It was a great and suspensive read with many twists and turns you do not figure out until the last page.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I've read a lot about the yellowface portrayed in the movie in particular. The film seemed to clarify quite nicely why the actors looked this way imo. I'm not sure where the confusion is?? If you read the book you'll have Mitchell literally spell it out for you. The novel now serves as a useful walkthrough guide for the film adaptation, and that is a rare thing in my experience.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Great movie with adventure and of course one of Disney's little creatures who steal the show, in this case the little dragon Mushu.  My kids love this movie...
B00992CF6W|4.0|Amazon has provided a new update for Minecraft Pocket Edition. V0.5.0 available. I can now play online with family and friends. Pretty good game.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|Follows the book better than most. I'll watch it again soon, followed by Atlas Shrugged. I wish she had written more.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|um i do like this app. in fact i love it. but something's been changed about it and now it is no longer compatible with the Google Nexus 7 even though its worked perfectly with my other nexuses Pooh!!!!!
B000IDEORY|4.0|Dirty Dancing was always one of my favorites, so I was thrilled when I saw they made a special edition with extra features after Patrick Swayze passed away!! The product arrived quickly and was in great condition!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I chose this rating because I originally thought it was the extended version. I was disappointed to see that it was not the day it arrived. My husband was satisfied with any the purchase so I am happy.
0316098329|5.0|In her international best seller, Room, Emma Donoghue transports the reader to a petrifying, yet slightly familiar eleven-by-eleven foot space. Donoghue takes on the tone of five year old Jack to tell a story of terror, family, and love. The reader experiences daily life alongside Jack, including his exercise regiment of walking around a small rug and his bedtime ritual of climbing into a wardrobe to sleep. For Jack, a little boy whose only access to reality is brief glimpses of television, life seems good. His mother, on the other hand, lives in a constant state of fear. Kidnapped, trapped, and raped at the age of nineteen, Ma struggles with the idea of freedom and what it might cost her and her son. Room is a beautiful story of struggle and triumph intertwined with the roles of a close family dynamic. Jack, a child whose world has been squeezed into one room, challenges the reader to contemplate what it means to truly live.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is a great album. What I liked the most is the new sound. I think that was something missing from the previous albums, a bit of a nerve and an attitude. This album can easily be played during a quiet night or loudly while driving. The melodies are there and so are the brilliant lyrics which come from personal experience. I love all the album tracks and i totally embrace the new experimental sound of Norah. She's an artist that evolves, she is not boring and she keeps bringing new stuff on table. I suggest everyone to check the album out and buy it if you like the music. It worth the money and it sounds great if you listen to the album in a rainy day or cold night!<br /><br />Standout tracks: Chasing Pirates, Waiting, Young Blood, It's Gonna Be, You've Ruined Me
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bitter sweet ending to a quick read. Enjoyed reading all three books. Interesting take on the future of the world.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|I have studied the Dracula lore for over 40 years and have found this movie to be both entertaining and factual.  Since my ancesters come from the Carpathians I feel that truely &#34;The Blood is the LIFE&#34;.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|I like this soundtrack a lot. It's fun, inventive and original.<br /><br />What I don't like is ordering it through the Amazon MP3 app, being told I can't login (despite using the correct information) and then being chard ANYWAY for an item that never downloaded. And won't download or show up in my cloud player. I like to buy from Amazon because it's cheaper than iTunes, but after this I won't be buying downloads on Amazon any more.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think this is a Great read! I recommend the book to any Riordan fan. I read the entire book in one day!
B008B9JSKU|4.0|This is a very good movie that will keep you guessing all the way to the end. Samuel L. Jackson performance is outstanding as always. Ruth Negga, a newcomer, is also really good.<br /><br />Foley (Jackson) gets released from prison after serving 25 years for killing his partner. His partner's son wants revenge. Not the usual kind, a different kind of revenge. Then Iris (Ruth Negga), appears and falls in love with Foley. Everything is slow and for a moment we think is a love story or a back stubbing plot. At the 40 minute mark of the movie the plots gets really twisted and then we start guessing all the way to the end which is a surprise.<br /><br />Four stars for the decent plot and the acting. Look forward to watch more movies with Ruth Negga. She has a great future in the business.
B009FZFONO|3.0|I was really looking forward to this current season but I'm disappointed with the storyline.  It doesn't seem to be going anywhere and it is excessively violent this season.  If I wanted to watch 40+ minutes of zombie slashing I'd play a video game.  I hope this season improves quickly or I'm cutting my losses.
B000ID37KO|5.0|&#34;The Birds&#34; has been a staole in my Halloween Week movie entertainment for years! I think it is one of Hitchcock's best movies and as familiar as I am with the film it still has the ability to scare me silly! I love it! Even today if I walk near a tree with birds stirring in it or a bird is flying low and I can hear their wings I still shudder and walk a little faster! The school is a real building and has its own haunted history which makes it extra fascinating and it has been reported that &#34;Hitch&#34; ruined Tippi Hedron's acting career because she wouldn't sleep with him so the mivie has a lot of intriguing stories that goes beyond the film itself.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I hesitate to recommend this book to everyone.  It is good fun.  If you are looking for a literary classic this book is not for you.  If you are not a fan of computers then this book may not fit your tastes.  If you find the '80s to be passé then you might not enjoy the many references to that time period.  However, IF you ever had to save your FORTRAN to a mainframe miles from your home...  IF you too wanted to be the Last Starfighter...  IF you know what an IF...THEN statement is and used a lot of them in high school ...THEN this book may appeal to you.<br /><br />This book is a futuristic story about a teenager whose only hope for a better life lies in competing in an online Virtual Reality Game contest set up by a programmer born in '73.  The book is laid out much like a video game where the main character has to work his way through the contest.  He has to solve the puzzles and work his way through the game.  Along the way he meets other \\"gunters\\" who become his friends, but can he really trust them?  That is often the question in MMOs.  Can he succeed without them?<br /><br />This book will probably never make it onto the classic 100 must read book list.  If, however you are looking for some light reading this book is a lot of fun.  As I drew closer to the finale of the book I did not want it to end.  I look forward to a sequel where, maybe the main character has to defeat IOI, a large conglomeration within this story that is bent on ruling the world.  I think that if you were a teenager during the early `80s, or have played any of the many MMORPGs (specifically this book brings to mind WoW and SL) then I think you might just enjoy what you find in the pages here.<br /><br />There is also, a hidden egg of its own within the written pages of the print books (sorry Kindle readers).  However, the Delorean has already been claimed.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Don't know how many times I've heard Jack Nicholson say that but it still creeps me out every time. I know every word in the film and I still am scared by it. It's a classic and perfect for Halloween. It is what got me into Stephen King. I had never heard of him before I saw the movie.
B00008GKEG|5.0|My husband is a big Beatles fan. He really wanted to have this DVD set, so I got it for him. He loved every disc, enjoyed listening to all the songs he knew (and even some he was hearing for the first time), and absorbed trivia that made him feel more \\"knowledgeable\\" about his favorite band. Seeing him smile and hearing him sing all the time said it all -- this is a good buy!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Even though I read the complete trilogy I found the books childish, repetitious, and boring. The BDSM context is interesting but other than that not much to them.  I thought book 1 and 3 were better than 2 and somewhere toward the end of 2 the style changes slightly with some new words being used (sideburns introduced, lengthening nipples, oh my and crap used much less) and the inner goddess being a bit less idiotic.  Got to love those half-moon glasses though (once they are tortoise shell!).
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best dictionary app. love the games on the home page and the extra info. even has several languages available
B00902MCVY|5.0|This album is definitely one of the must haves for any self respecting fan of melodic death/folk/epic metal. The japanese theme is pervasive throughout the album with the instruments carving out mournful melodies and haunting harmonies. Just when one thinks that it's all soft and slow, Jari kicks in with his signature style of guitar playing and the rest is history.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorite albums of all time (no pun intended).<br /><br />Listen to this album in order since a couple of the tracks flow into the next ones.
B003HARV98|5.0|With this debut album, Marina has set a new standard.<br />Fresh, biting, poetic and lyrical all sung in an amazing<br />multi-range voice.  With this album Marina stands on the<br />shoulders of Kate Bush. Alive and inventive, you'll find<br />new and clever insights with each listening.  Give her work<br />a few listens and be amazed.  \\"I Am Not A Robot\\" and<br />\\"Hollywood Infested\\" are standouts in a hard-to-pick-favorites<br />selection of truly original tunes.<br />Rob Melnyk<br /><br />(An Amazon purchase)

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie stayed very close to the book, and as a result I was not disappointed.  This movie is among the best I've seen and strongly recommend it.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|Asimov outdoes himself in this novel - it is a real masterpiece of hard science fiction. Asimov clearly utilized all of his PhD knowledge of science and poured it all into the ideas that drive this book. His biochemistry mastery also enables him to create an alien race that is far beyond any I've yet encountered in the realm of Para-Universe Science Fiction.<br /><br />Three stories link and twist through time and space and worlds and the technology he invents is like a character all on its own by the time the novel reaches its complex and satisfying conclusion.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|...but for a 1.99 price, it should have more features.<br /><br />It's very fast and very easy to use. Perfect for lightweight, basic camera functionality.<br /><br />This app does not deserve the low ratings that complain about the kindle's lack of a back facing camera.

B009UQCD0K|5.0|Love the series, would recommend the 3 season to anyone. Every episode just gets better and better and wants me wanting more.
B008D30K7E|5.0|This is the most enjoyable book which I have read since Roddy Doyle's Barrytown trilogy. Laughing out loud at the humour wherever I was reading it was the common thread shared with The Commitments, The Snapper and The Van. The \\"100 year old man\\" is truly great escapism.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought it was a good movie, the graphics were alright, worth the $1.99 to watch! Anymore than that, don't waste your money.
B007THA4FI|3.0|More profanity than necessary.  Theme is very dark and depressing.  The ending is also very depressing.  After all the negativity of the U.S. presidential election this was a bit too much.

0763644765|5.0|This is the only potty-related book we have bought our sixteen-month-old daughter (so far). We've had it for about two weeks. It sits on a stand right next to her Baby Bjorn potty chair (which she has already successfully used twice!). She sits on her chair and reads this book several times per day. She loves it!<br /><br />Some things about this book:<br />The pictures are very simple, so they aren't overstimulating.<br />The child in the book is gender neutral. The author also doesn't use the words \\"she\\", \\"he\\", \\"boy\\", \\"girl\\". The story is written from the child's point of view, and the child always says \\"I\\". This makes it very nice if you have multiple children to potty train or plan on keeping the book for multiple children.<br />The sentences are all short and to the point, perfect for toddlers to understand.<br />This book doesn't use the words \\"poop\\", \\"pee\\", or anything like that. That makes it easy to teach your child the words you want him/her to say regarding bodily functions.<br />I love the final page of the book. The are tons of drawings of \\"undies\\" (the author's word) in boy and girl styles. We already bought our daughter some \\"big girl undies\\" (one pair sits with the book to help reinforce the picture).<br />There is just enough humor to keep the book from being too serious, but not so much that it makes the book completely comical.<br />This book will not potty train your child (that's your job), but it will help reinforce what you are trying to teach. Not to mention, it gives you both something fun to do while you are waiting.<br />This is one of those books that I don't mind reading to my daughter hundreds of times. It's easy to add some of your own dialogue to the book. That keeps it from getting boring, since I try to change it up every time I read it.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|this cd far surpassed my expectations.. it is a great body of work.. definately recommend.. soothing sounds.. wonderful music.. just what I wanted..
0525952926|2.0|Book two of Ken Follett's trilogy was a big disappointment. Rather than looking forward to the third, I am unlikely to read it.<br /><br />The main players were still in place, but they were not fleshed out. It was especially disappointing since the period involved was one of the most complex in modern history.<br /><br />This seemed to be hastily written, or badly edited. And when you read a very long book and wish that it was much longer, you know it was not a very good effort.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Some of the reviews suggest limited ability to position the camera. It is true that when your Kindle is placed in the case with the USB/charging port exposed, the camera out of necessity is on the right. Therefore it limits the camera to the bottom when the case is opened in the landscape position. However, I was able to position the camera on top (preferred for Skype) by opening the case inside out. The ribbed exterior surface of the case allows a user to do that without much problem.
B000FBJHT4|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. I had no idea all of these events took place, of course I had heard the stories but to read about them from someone that was there is much more credible.

B00439MV42|4.0|I recently watched all 3 of the Back to the Future series with my kids.  They are still fun to watch.  The only \\"ding\\" I have is the language.  I saw these in the '80s when they first came out and just don't remember the language being so bad.  Now that could be a sign of my age now ;)  or a sign of my age then!  In either case, be aware if you're watching this with a younger audience, there is a fair amount of very gratuitous foul language.  That aside, we loved seeing this again.  Marty is still a great character Doc is still a lovable eccentric that steals the show.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Expectations were all over the map when Soundgarden reunited and recorded a new album after 16 years.  Some got their hopes up too high, while others saw nothing but a failure to reach the heights of their glory days.<br /><br />The reality turns out to be very satisfying with no great surprises.  Soundgarden does itself proud with an album that overall sounds excellent, with nine of thirteen great songs and only four that are not so great.  No, it's not in the same ballpark as BADMOTORFINGER or SUPERUNKNOWN, but in its own right it is one of the best rock releases of 2012.<br /><br />For me, the weak tracks are Been Away Too Long, Bones of Birds, Taree, and Eyelid's Mouth.  The others all sound fantastic, with the strongest sequence running from Non-State Actor to By Crooked Steps, A Thousand Days Before, and Blood on the Valley Floor.  Black Saturday is a stand-out as well.<br /><br />As rock has declined, there hasn't been another movement with the same mass popularity since Seattle's grunge wave of the early Nineties.  Pearl Jam has carried on the whole while, and they still sounded superb when I saw them live in Atlanta in September 2012.  It is most welcome that Soundgarden is ending its long break!<br /><br />I haven't seen anyone yet credit Josh Graham for the incredible cover art!  The sculpture is called \\"The Last Equinox.\\"  Graham is probably best known for his work with Neurosis, and I certainly wouldn't mind if Soundgarden incorporated some of that great band's sound into its next album...<br /><br />(Review #72, 11/18/12)

B009B4ZEKM|3.0|Watching Christina evolve as an artist has been interesting, but I can't help but feel she is playing it safe with \\"Lotus\\".  The album isn't as raunchy and eyerolling as \\"Bionic\\", but that doesn't necessarily mean it's better.  There are a few good tracks, but overall, it's the kind of album you would play in the background just as the party is starting.  I admit I don't get the appeal to \\"Your Body\\", a song that is getting a lot of praise, but is completely lacking in that fun, catchy quality any pop hit has.  I have heard that song several times now, and I still couldn't sing a word of it from memory.  I think it's overrated.<br /><br />Honestly, though, I think Christina herself is overrated.  Does she have a big voice?  Yes, she does, but so what?  While she is perfectly capable of reining that voice in and delivering some impressive vocals, more often than not, she over-sings.  She is a talented woman, yet she insists on bleating everything out like a dying farm animal.  Maybe this puts me in the minority, but I don't think a big voice equals big talent.  Even the overall theme of \\"Lotus\\" is recycled and cheesy, what with Christina's \\"rebirth\\" and the god-awful cover art.  I feel like we've heard this new! empowered! female! schtick from her many times before, which is why I rated the album at three stars.  It's not offensive in any way, but it isn't impressive, either.  Gets a big ol' MEH from me.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Ya so as far as this genre can go, it was good but not the best. Would recommend it if your board.
B00A135YUW|5.0|This was my first taste of Lana Del Rey. And it tasted like Pepsi Cola. The strings. The silky whispered vocals. The haunting, honest, and at times filthy lyrics. Ummm where has she been all my life lol. Just brilliant.<br /><br />Standout tracks for me are American, Cola, Blue Velvet, and Gods & Monsters.<br /><br />This is an exceptional EP. I look forward to the next release.

B000LB7G00|5.0|Originally bought for $25 it for CAD, but using it with Revit 2013.<br />I was trained as a mech.E, but doing some amateur architecture<br />work.<br /><br />Simply...Don't know how I got along without it.<br /><br />There it the obvious advantage of being able to move your model<br />around a little more intuitively (object mode--you act like<br />you're grabbing the object).<br /><br />More importantly, when viewing elevations or plans, you can manipulate<br />with your mouse and simultaneously zoom and pan with your other<br />hand, WITHOUT DROPPING THE OBJECT YOU'RE DEALING WITH.  This is<br />the reason I still use vi (unix text editor).  Not having your<br />hands leave the keyboard to use a mouse saves half a sec x 1000 times<br />a day.  Same thing with this.  With revit, the 2 times I'd<br />need to hit the kb would be for esc and tab or space, so you could<br />program the buttons if you wanted.<br /><br />So much of the time, you grab an object, and then want to<br />grab the end to resize or move.  Oops, the end is off the screen.<br />(and I'm using a 30\\" monitor).  Use the navigator to push your<br />model back (or to the side) and now it's visible and you can<br />click on the handle.<br /><br />I feel like I'm holding the object in my left hand(navigator)<br />and using a tool(mouse) in my right (despite the fact that I'm left handed).<br />A good test for me of how good a tool/addon is how much I<br />mistakenly do something in the wrong mode.  Do you find yourself<br />trying to use mouse gestures in the wrong place?  Do you find yourself<br />hitting a nontouchpad screen trying to swipe like a tablet?<br />The little fingerprints on my monitor screen tells me my daughter<br />does this too.<br />I now find myself reaching for the navigator mistakenly trying to<br />zoom/pan on a webpage all the time now.<br /><br />On the mechanical side, this is a nicely machined and polished<br />very heavy chunk of metal.

B009AMAKSQ|5.0|When the trailer proudly stated that The Perks of Being a Wallflower was from the producers of Juno, I found myself wishing that it had the same writer and director too. But after seeing the movie, I'm more than happy with what I was given. Stephen Chbosky wrote and directed, and he has captured the same feeling that some of the best teen movies of the 80s (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller, Heathers) had, and has probably improved upon them.<br /><br />Perks feels more like a combination of Dead Poets Society and Stand By Me than some of the pure comedies from that era, but it has an abundance of funny scenes mixed in with the more serious and reflective observations. In short, it's a mature look at what teens have to go through. Everybody who has lived through their teen years will identify with this movie.<br /><br />We see the world through the eyes of 15-year-old Charlie (Lerman). He's about to start high school and he's terrified that he won't be able to make any friends. His nightmares appear to be confirmed until he joins two students at their table during lunch. They are a little older than him, but seem sympathetic to his plight.<br /><br />Minor spoilers follow, but nothing that isn't revealed in the opening minutes of the movie:<br /><br />His two lunch companions are Sam (Watson), who is an outgoing girl and seems very sure of herself, and Patrick (Miller), who has already caught Charlie's eye by playing pranks in class. Charlie thinks they are a couple, but Sam is in fact Patrick's half-sister. Charlie likes both immediately and quickly becomes smitten with Sam. Patrick is flamboyant and we learn that he's gay. The friendship between the three is the very heart of the film.<br /><br />The themes are not exactly original, but definitely a part of growing up. You'll see the agony of young love, drunken parties, experiments with drugs, and deeper emotional problems that most young people face at one time or another.<br /><br />Another major theme is the importance of music. One scene involving the three friends features a drive through a tunnel in which they discover an unknown song on the radio. It's one of the key scenes in the movie. Not only does it capture a feeling associated with youth, it also highlights the difference between Sam and Charlie. He's shy and reserved, while she has a free spirit. We see Charlie develop throughout the movie and try to recapture that feeling. I did feel old for a moment when I realized that younger people might not know the music of David Bowie, or would consider the music of the Cocteau Twins old.<br /><br />The movie touches on deeper themes that would not belong in a pure comedy, but they just add to the richness of this wonderful story. Fans of The Rocky Horror Picture Show will be pleased that a couple of the scenes touch on the influence of that movie and play a part in the overall story.<br /><br />One thing that I was interested to see was the performance of Emma Watson. I did catch her small performance in My Week with Marilyn, but this was the first time I had seen her in a major role since the Harry Potter movies. When you know an actor for one role in particular, it can be difficult to imagine them as anyone else, but I was impressed with Watson's performance. Although I still recognized some familiar gestures and expressions, she wasn't Hermione Granger. She's very believable as Sam.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower surprised me considerably. My teen years seem like a lifetime ago, but the movie took me right back to those formative years. I was on the verge of tears several times and laughed often. What more could you want from a movie?<br /><br />One of my close friends will love this movie. Especially a scene in which someone claims that music sounds better on vinyl.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5importance of music.

Everytime I listen to it I hear something new on it even if it's just a little something.<br />I would say BUY this, it's great...
B009AMANBA|4.0|I knew that I would have to see Lincoln because it stars Daniel Day-Lewis, but I was wary of the subject matter. Most historical epics leave me cold, and I find that I have little interest in politics of any kind. The prospect of watching two-and-a-half hours of (mostly) men dressed in 1860s garb, and depictions of the Civil War, did not exactly appeal. I had similar misgivings about The Iron Lady (a far inferior film), but wanted to watch the best actress of her generation, Meryl Streep.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, with the exception of the opening battle scene, Spielberg chose to do something rather different.<br /><br />I remember a conversation with Quentin Tarantino, in which he was asked the question whether he would ever direct the biography of someone like Elvis Presley. Tarantino replied that he couldn't imagine covering Presley's whole life, but it might be interesting to write a story depicting the day he signed with Sun Records. Spielberg has chosen a similar strategy for Lincoln. Instead of being shown Lincoln's entire life, Spielberg focuses on the vote to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, to abolish slavery.<br /><br />This sharp focus worked well in another political drama, Frost/Nixon, in which David Frost tries to extract an apology from Nixon for the crimes he committed while in power.<br /><br />Lincoln believes in the Thirteenth Amendment, and that the Civil War might be ended if he can get the bill passed. The film shows the methods Lincoln and his subordinates use to secure the required number of votes. He calculates that, in addition to the Republican votes, he will need 20 from other sources. We see what motivates some of the men who might be persuaded to vote in favor of the bill.<br /><br />On a deeper level, the film is inevitably a character study. We see how Lincoln listens to men from every walk of life and makes them feel valued. He earns their respect, loyalty, and even their love. On a more personal level, he has problems within his own family. Lincoln has to face his wife, Mary (Sally Field), as she questions some of his actions. One of the biggest dilemmas is whether Lincoln should allow his son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to fight in the Civil War.<br /><br />Other key characters include Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), who has motivations of his own regarding the bill, and William Seward (David Strathairn), Lincoln's Secretary of State.<br /><br />This is an all-star cast, and the acting is superb across the board. Day-Lewis is arguably the finest male actor of the current century, and this performance only adds to his legend. As always, he inhabits the character, never sounding just like himself. Compare this latest performance to his Oscar-winning role in There Will Be Blood, and you'll see what I mean. Lincoln speaks softly for the most part, but he captivates his audience. He tells a number of amusing anecdotes and the audience in my theater loved most of them.<br /><br />Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones could also receive nominations in the supporting categories. If you remove those three actors, the cast would still be stronger than that seen in most movies.<br /><br />While Lincoln isn't the ideal type of film for me, I respect what it achieves. The technical work matches the excellent acting. If I had a greater interest in history, or politics, I would probably have liked Lincoln even more. I could imagine American audiences being fascinated by the subject. This will be one of the leading contenders for Oscar nominations.<br /><br />Possible glitch in the matrix: D-Day from Animal House (McGill) appears alongside D. Day-Lewis.own family.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|Marvelous movie. Heartwarming, Hilarious. Well cast, wonderfuly well acted....especially Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver. The setting: A working class neighborhood in Philadelphia, peopled by obsessed Eagles fans and bettors. The story: Cooper's character, Pat, has spent the last several months in a mental institution, being treated for bi-polar disorder. His ex-wife has taken out a restraining order  on him. Without telling Dad (De Niro), Mom (Weaver) springs Pat and brings him home. Pat has a two-point plan: 1. go off his meds, 2. get his wife back. One day, while out for a run, he runs into a quirky and feisty young widow named Tiffany who's also clinging to sanity by a thread. A wary friendship ensues. Eventually they strike a deal: she'll help him get his wife back in exchange for him helping her win a dance contest. Family and friends get involved, bets are made, stakes are high, and in their own diverse ways, everyone's future is riding on the outcome.<br /><br />P.S. Lots of interesting outtakes on the DVD extras, plus interesting interviews with the four principal actors and raves from Dr. Oz and others working with those with  bi-polar disorder.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is so good that we have to warn people about this DVD.  It seems once you start watching your first episode, you won't be able to tear yourself away from the other episodes.  It is truly interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful book, almost impossible to put this series down.  You get dragged into the story and become attached to the characters.  Highly recommended to anyone who considers themselves a reader, young or old.  Make sure you own the series before you start reading them because the endings make you rush straight into the next book without a moment's pause.
B009LHFYNG|5.0|A must for all involved with neurophysiology, neuropsychiatry and psychiatry.<br />Clearly written, easy to comprehend, concise with informative illustrations and comprehensive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book has everything to keep you reading, the heart never stops racing, the suspense keeps you guessing at every turn.  This book dragged me in emotionally and physically, it would have been a pleasure to ignore the rest of the world to immerse myself into this world, but even without that possibility, every possible hour i could was devoted to reading this series.  Highly recommended for all readers, and I truly believe this will be a series that will last ages.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Black Country Communion are a British/American supergroup named after the Black Country area of England from which their singer and drummer hail, who play a classic rock sound that is rooted firmly in the 1970s but with a few modern twists, and who are rather prolific, having released three studio albums and a live album/DVD/Blu-Ray in just three years.<br /><br />2012's Afterglow is the band's third full-length studio album. As with all the band's previous work, the album was produced by Kevin Shirley and the line-up consists of Glen Hughes (Deep Purple, Trapeze, Black Sabbath) on bass and vocals, modern Blues icon Joe Bonamassa on guitar and occasional vocals, Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater, Planet X, Alice Cooper, Yngwie Malmsteen) on keyboards and Jason Bonham (Led Zeppelin reunions, Jimmy Page, The Firm, Paul Rogers, UFO) on the drums.<br /><br />This third album is still very much in the 1970s bluesy rock mould of the band's previous work, but there are a few twists and turns musically, into funk, soul and rnb territory adding variety and colour to the existing formula. There is a bit of a lush orchestral touch on a few songs as usual and in general, the album does the best job it can of balancing keeping what makes the band so good in the first place with not becoming stale.<br /><br />Conscious of not repeating the structural formula of their previous work too closely either, the album doesn't open with a speedy hard rock number (`Black Country' & `The Outsider') although they still managed to write such a track and release it as the albums first single (`Confessor') but let it hang back a little later in the running order.<br /><br />The album once more has a different feel than the previous two in that Joe Bonamassa contributed less music and Jason Bonham contributed more than previously, and then on top of that, the album originally started out as a Glen Hughes solo album before being reworked into a band effort.<br /><br />The album has generated some non-musical press because the band members disagree publicly about touring in support of the album, as the band normally have to fit touring around Joe Bonamassa's hectic schedule but they released this particular album at an inconvenient time for Joe. Regardless, while context is interesting, an album realistically ought to be judged on musical merit alone and so its probably best not to let that touring-argument influence your opinion.<br /><br />At the end of the day; everybody will have their own opinion of this album, whether that be that it is the best thing they ever done, a giant disappointment or just average. In my personal opinion the album is an absolute masterstroke and I love it more with each listen.<br /><br />From the bouncy moments like `Cry Freedom,' to the funky `Big Train,' and the hard closer `Crawl' every track on the album is enjoyable, the music and vocals are utterly sublime and the production is brilliant sounding. Just like, and perhaps even a little more so than the two albums which preceded it, it just sounds like a classic album. Just listening to the brief guitar solo on the title track, or the main riff on `The Giver' gives off the feel of something that I've known and loved for years even on the first listen.<br /><br />Overall; I highly recommend this album if you like the band. If possible try to disregard the press surrounding the touring and just enjoy the well-crafted music. Furthermore; if you can get it for a good price, try and get the special edition version which has a DVD with some music videos and more importantly an enjoyable 45-minute making-of documentary with a lot of studio footage, where you can hear them working out tracks like `Dandelion' on acoustic guitars before hand and having a bit of fun between takes.n-musical press because the band members disagree publicly about touring in support of the album, as the band normally have to fit touring around Joe Bonamassa's hectic schedule but they released this particular album at an inconvenient time for Joe.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|There aren't many books that will draw me in so completely that the rest of the world fades away.  This trilogy is non stop from beginning to end will a full cast of complicated characters, not one character is undeveloped and they each add to the story in their own unique way.  The details are rich and it truly brings this world to life, which makes it easier to lose yourself in their world.<br />I recommend owning all three novels before starting, the endings are cleverly written cliffhangers and having to wait for the next book will be torture for some people.<br />These books may be written for teens and center around a teen protagonist, but Katniss Everdeen is more complex than you'd think, in some instances she appears younger than her actual age because she is naive about certain things, but in other instances she is wise beyond her years because of the harsh circumstances of the world she lives in and the fate she had been dealt.  This complexity is what makes this series open to everyone and not just teens.<br />I recommend putting this series in everyone's &#34;must read&#34; pile.

0143120530|4.0|Josh Foer's book [[ASIN:B004Q9JQGA Moonwalking with Einstein]] follows the author, who was a fresh-out-of-college journalist at the time, on his journey into the world of competitive memory training. Each chapter explores a different theme under the umbrella of memory and cognition, with plenty of humorous stories as well as practical tips. In parallel is an account of his own personal training for the US Memory Championships.<br /><br />Overall it was a very compelling book, easy to pick up and hard to put down. Compared to other pop-science type books, i.e. Malcolm Gladwell's [[ASIN:0316057908 Blink]], I found this to be more accessible and relatable -- largely because Foer continually stresses how much of an average guy he is, and how the techniques he's learning were once the common domain of every educated person. In other words, there's a big \\"you can do this too!\\" theme in the book, and Foer provides plenty of how-to guides.<br /><br />I tried the techniques in this book, and they really did work! I read it a week ago, and I can still remember the \\"dummy list\\" Foer provided somewhere in the middle of the book: pickled garlic, cottage cheese, smoked salmon, six bottles of white wine... :) the technique really is easy to implement.<br /><br />At times I found the writing style to be a bit overwrought, where it seems like he's trying too hard to sound clever. But on the whole, the writing was enjoyable, and the story itself was one that I'll remember for a while. Highly recommended!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies. If you dislike this movie, you should go in a hole and not come out until you have reassessed your bad taste.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Raketeer keeps one staying up late for too many nights in a row.  I often fall into bed with a book and then fall off to sleep after a few pages.  Couldn't do it with this book.  It took real discipline to close my Kindle and say &#34;Good Night&#34;.<br /><br />Anyone who likes Grisham will love this book.  Anyone who likes a good mystery will love it.
B009Z8HCR2|4.0|If you've been a fan of the Deftones the past decade, I see no reason to not like this cd. It's alot like their two previous discs Saturday Night Wrist and Diamond Eyes. A bit heavier than Diamond Eyes and less daring than SNW. Chino seems to scream less and less with each release, but that only makes it better for me. My favorites at this point are Swerve City, Tempest, Gauze, and Goon Squad.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great app!You should toats get this apperoni.:-)I would definantly get this amazing app.It's fun and has cool extras.The only downside is that you have to wait for more coins.I also reccomend the apps skaterboy and paplinko both by this devoleper.
B009AZZ6H8|4.0|I knew long before this cd became a reality that this group would not be what they once were. Cornell's range has gone down considerably and they are all almost 20 years older than they were the last time they released a studio album. All things considered though, this is a solid effort/return. The first half of the cd rocks pretty well overall. A Thousand Days Before could very easily be the next single. \\"Been Away Too Long\\" (the first single), \\"By Crooked Steps\\", and \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" are classic Soundgarden with only Cornell's classic wail missing. The second half of the cd falls off in intensity, but there aren't any truely bad songs. \\"Attrition\\" is one of the most  straight forward rock tracks I've ever heard from Soundgarden and almost feels out of place. While the middle part of the cd slips a bit, thankfully the disc closes strong with \\"Eyelids Mouth\\" and \\"Rowing\\". While far from the masterpieces that were Badmotorfinger and Superunknown, this is still an effort worthy of being part of the Soundgarden discography. If only it could have been released sooner so that Cornell's vocals could shine even more.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Simply amazing. I've read the whole Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan/friends(except the last book of course) which is supposedly \\"The best fantasy series of all time\\", and this book blows those out of the water. Amazing character development with a great plot. You couldn't ask for anything else in a story. Best part is the main character doesn't go through a *broody emo I hate myself* phase after the first death, which is so refreshing as broody vampire types seem to be so popular these days.

B0091Q82L8|5.0|I just listened to this and I thought it was terrific! Sure, the sound quality is a little rough, but it is very similar to actually being at a concert. Sometimes it has a psychedelic/jam-band/porn movie vibe going that highlights a great band at it's peak. Also prominent in the mix is the drumming of Keith Moon, one of the best for sure and this makes you miss him even more. You already own everything else so just buy this and enjoy!
B004T4KQJS|3.0|I thought this would be for the general public. However, when the author started describing a flat universe and space matter that exists sometimes and not others, I lost interest.<br /><br />Maybe this subject is beyond the layman, but I still think it could better be presented to the general, curious public.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|What's always hooked me to Fagen's voice as early as 1973 is the perfect balance it strikes between strong and fragile. If he has any peers, I'm not sure who it is. The music here is warm and polished - pop-jazz and relaxing funk that's always been his bread and butter. He's nostalgiac in his sarcastic way when he confronts his own aging. But he'll live the moment to its fullest in the opening cut. In a terrific funky Isaac Hayes cover, he's still impressed by his baby's textbook-and-street smarts wherever she's from. One song that's more modern blues in feel, \\"Weather In My Head\\", beseeches the question of what to do with the storm inside of him. And on \\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\", he doesn't merely accept but so embraces getting dumped that his stature has grown an inch. There's realism at its coolest. How often has that been stated in song? I don't find myself having to sail past any of these songs. It's slick and beautifully layered with saxophones and guitar. This is the qualified successor to \\"The Nightfly\\" and that barely edges this out. It doesn't seem thirty years later with this new release. Maybe five.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I found reading this book quite interesting for many reasons, although, I must say, I do not like the writting style of Mr Schwarzenegger. It is clear that his skills go in other direction.<br /> Notwithstanding that, the book is kind to read for someone who has seen all his films and likes him like this reader. To see most of his ambitions met is always good to see.  His improvement in many fields are remarkable  and constitute some kind of model to be taken in account for others, specially when considering his  humble origin, although some of his thoughts about Europe and Austria seem not to be exact. But that,s his opinion.<br />I spend a good time reading this book

B00000IMTF|5.0|Rainbow, the project of former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, returned a year after releasing their eponymous debut. This 1976 effort was not only a successful sophomore album, it was a release to be reckoned with in the hard rock and heavy metal genres. And it is made all-that-much-more great when considering the fact that Rainbow lost three-fifths of the personal that was responsible for the recording of that 1975 effort. So, with \\"Rising,\\" Blackmore (alongside frontman Ronny James Dio) not only returned, they returned in as big of a way as possible!<br /><br />Blackmore drives and anchors the songs with his signature blend of hefty, meaty riffs and totally air-guitar-worthy solos -- he spits those things out better than almost any guitarist this side of Jimmy Page. But the songs' rock solid rhythm section - comprised of exceptional drumming and a thick, heavy bass tone - must also be noted, as well as their stellar, soaring vocals. And one must not forget to mention keyboard ace Tony Carey, who is heard very prominently and exceptionally throughout these six cuts.<br /><br />And, of course, no review of \\"Rainbow\\" can be complete without mentioning its importance. This record was monumental in the hard rock community, and it was the biggest -- and sometimes sole -- source of inspiration for like a zillion bands in the future. (It is pretty much a given that any hard rock, traditional metal, stoner metal, and doom metal band that has formed since 1976 cites this album as an influence.)<br /><br />Opener \\"Tarot Woman\\" is one-and-a-half minutes of excellent, epic synth soloing (from keyboard ace Tony Carey), and three-and-a-half-minutes of heavy, driving guitars, hard-rocking rhythms, and vintage Dio-esque clean singing. A melodic, and even vaguely jazzy-sounding guitar solo is also included in this song. \\"Run With The Wolf\\" has staccato, bobbing guitar hooks chunked-up by a fat bass part, and anchored by dexterous, crashing drums. And some more wailing guitar soloing and powerful, nearly-anthemic choruses also highlight this track. \\"Starstruck\\" is propelled by a catchy, galloping, Sabbath-y riff slices that lead well into the memorable choruses, which have killer vocal patterns in them. A soaring, piercing solo pierces the air, too.<br /><br />\\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" features a surprisingly brisk tempo, and more instantly memorable and insanely catchy vocals and choruses. (The title phrase will be stuck in your head for days.) \\"Stargazer\\" is highlighted by a terrifically deft, thundering, ten-second-long intro drum solo, more soaring, soulful clean singing, a strong, grumbling bass bottom, and a superbly lengthy, winding guitar solo section that clocks in at an epic two-whole-minutes in length (!). \\"Rainbow Rising\\" closes with the epic \\"A Light In The Black,\\" which clocks in at eight-minutes long. It is a piece of early, Judas Priest-inspired speed metal, with its surprisingly fast pacing, dual guitar leads, and three surprisingly twiddly, back-to-back solos. The song's lengthy synth solo cannot go unnoticed, either.<br /><br />\\"Rising\\" is not as good or iconic as, say, \\"Paranoid\\" or \\"Machine Head,\\" but it is a pretty darn great record nonetheless. And it is for certain that, with this album, Rainbow cemented their status as deserving of being mentioned in the same breath as Pentagram, Black Sabbath, Dio, and yes, Deep Purple.tar soloing and powerful, nearly-anthemic choruses also highlight this track. \\"Starstruck\\" is propelled by a catchy, galloping, Sabbath-y riff slices that lead well into the memorable choruses, which have killer vocal patterns in them.

B0053O89IS|2.0|Hello David - I was actually logging on to contact you regarding Season 7 of Bones and as it happens, there was your email asking for my rating.  Well Sir, Everything looked to be in order but upon viewing one disc of Bones was not Bones at all but a disc from Philadelphia.  Both labels looked a lot alike.  So, the question is, can I swap the Philadelphia disc for the missing Bones disc?  The question is, did you sell the Philadelphia series to another buyer?  This Season 7 was gift to a friend and she was a little disappointed as she is a super fan of Bones.  If you sold Philadelphia you'll probably hear from them too unless they don't know yet.  I hope  we can resolve this issue as clearly you are an excellent seller.  Ray Sutton - Email DocRS1951@comcast.net.
B008KMHFJY|2.0|The characters in Beautiful Disaster are older teens, but I'm glad the publisher has marked this as adult (at least at Netgally where I got it from), because of the unnecessary emphasis on smoking, drinking, sex and violence. I'm cool with all that when it's not over done, but not when the most action that happens is the characters getting drunk and throwing up. Unfortunately, however, teens are reading this book and it glorifies violence as a way of solving problems.<br /><br />This is contemporary fiction, not fantasy, so the violence is real. The hero is a guy who pummels people as his way of coping with his emotions. I'm not into censorship, but I am into responsible publication, and this story is a socially irresponsible publication for teen readers. It would have been nice to see the girlfriend at least not like Travis's violence! But, no, she just accepted it as a valid way to deal with things. It would also have been nice to see him develop some other coping skills, but, no, he curbed his sex, but not his drinking, smoking or fighting. Had the characters grown, this could have been a good book, as it was, it didn't go any further than getting the guy and girl together. That isn't coming of age; growing up is.<br /><br />I was in a group on Goodreads where teens were raving about the book mainly because Travis's love for Pidge is so solid and he tries so hard that he is endearing, but teens tend not to look at the deeper issues, and that's the problem here because the issues are there, but they are not examined. The binge drinking, violence and gambling are not questioned in any way. At least the line is drawn at working for the Mob.<br /><br />The prose is excellent. The characters are well fleshed out and easy to relate to, but Travis--even though I liked him--is too obvious a `bad-boy' stereotype with too predictable reactions. The author has laid the `bad' on too thick--gambling, drinking, promiscuity, smoking, fighting; he even has a motor-bike. There isn't much of a story, just a relationship between a `bad' boy and a girl I found stupid for the early part of the book (she, at least, showed some sense later in the book). There was too much repetition of the relationship issues, no deep themes I could see, and too little action to keep me interested.<br /><br />I almost didn't finish this book because I got bored around 30% of the way through, annoyed at around 40%  and at the halfway point, when Travis turned into a real jerk, I just couldn't see how it was going to get any better. His violent jealousy was made to appear endearing! I wonder if the publisher was so enamoured with the quality of the prose that they didn't stop to consider the actual story.  They certainly don't care about the negative role models they're presenting here. I picked it up again after a recommendation by a bunch of teens and I'm glad I did because it proved me right. The second half was more interesting, and the ending was good, but the book failed to redeem itself.<br /><br />If you're not bored by stereotypes, excessive self-destructive behaviour and the details of a highly frustrating relationship, then you may well get to the end, and there is plenty in the character interactions to enjoy. Personally, though, I expect more thought put into a book from Simon & Schuster. They got the title right though; Beautiful refers to the prose; disaster refers to the story.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars due a repetitive plot, and a lack of character development and conceptual editing. I wouldn't want my daughter to have read it before she left school and now that she is, luckily she is intelligent enough that she would find the kids stupid behaviour as boring as I.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great book, very suspensful and with a surprising ending.  As I read, I could not figure out where the plot was headed, so it kept my interest.  Lots of twists and turns which I loved.  I've read most all of Grisham's books and this was one of his best.

B007FRHZ4A|2.0|We got this for my son for his 6th Birthday. This game is a great idea.  I love that you have to build the structures shown on the cards. The problem is the blocks aren't solid with flat surfaces and you can't build the structures shown.  If there is the slightest wiggle the entire structure falls over, and we can't enjoy playing the game because my son gets angry because he can't build it.  It should be called Angry Children not Angry Birds!  I really hope they rethink these games with flat surfaces because if it was easier to build the structure it'd be a lot of fun.
B004JMY312|5.0|Great Halloween movie for kids.  We wanted something only a little scary for our Halloween movie night.  My girls loved it and watched it several times!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Great special affects but that was about all in this movie prequel to the Alien story. The story line was predictable and dumb. I liked the original Alien movies, especially the second \\"Aliens\\" as the suspense was great. This movie was a let down in my expectations and it seemed too short and fragmented. The actions of the characters was stupid and nonsensical in the way they did things. Poor directing in my opinion, shame on you Ridly Scott! I expected something more then this 3rd rate attempt.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great suspense and plot!  I highly recommend it!  It has some very touching moments that you might want to have a tissue, but that's what a good movie will do to you!

B009HV2JT8|1.0|The book was incredible and one of the best I have read in years. I was really looking forward to the movie---what a disappointment. I know movies and books are never the same, but I cannot imagine a worse job. If you read the book, skip the movie. If you saw the movie -- you have to read the book. I just hope they do not make a movie of Unholy Night.
B0091THRCU|3.0|Everything works great.  Good build quality, looks nice, etc.  The only problem is in its actual use.  I often check the time with my phone, but can't do it easily with this, because the face is hidden.  I love to quickly be able to take a photo with my phone, but can't, because the camera is hidden.<br /><br />And if you get a call, but are carrying something, you can't answer the phone, because it takes two hands to remove the phone from the case.<br /><br />In short, I thought I would love this case, and it did deliver everything I expected, but it just wasn't practical (for me, anyway).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As always, well written and quickly catches and keeps your attention. Characters are interesting and plot is very good. I just love the style of a John Grisham novel.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Well written and very informative. One learns a lot about zoos and wild animals and then is ambushed by a terrible disaster at sea and an equally disturbing saga of survival. It was a lot more violent and bloody than I anticipated. I understand that the movie version of this book is going to be rated PG or PG-13. If so, they might as well change the title to A boy and His Cat Go Sailing.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Witches, ghosts, magic, love and then they throw in a little bit of steampunk.  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Two words: Bow-Wring. Not too boring though. There were pockets of excitement enough to keep me watching. There was not a continuum of scenes that the sci-fi fan would stay excited. A movie such as this does/should not have a goal to teach, but to entertain. If it wants to make a point about intergalactic, waste dumping,  imperialism or even creation then they can throw it in. A great cast with very good acting, but the print-to-screen left something to be desired. The visuals were perfect. I will not be dumping this one, but will not place it at the top of my \\"to watch again soon\\" list either.<br /><br />I barely give this one three stars because of the special effects and pockets of excitement that were few and far between. Clearly , this movie did not live up to the hype, but it barely deserves a thumbs up.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|This movie is great. My husband and I enjoyed this movie alot. Its funny, exciting, and there's some fine ass actors in there. Kicking some butt. Everybody should see it
B0056CUZRA|4.0|Never having read any of Ken Follett's books before, I was dumbfounded when I saw the size of the book! But, what a wonderful story it produced....enthralling from beginning to end!<br />This told a story about war with so many different characters and from so many different perspectives that it was almost impossible to know who you wanted to succeed.....but I was glad to see who the individual winners were at the end....<br />I look forward to reading the next book in the trilogy.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|the acting was terrible, the scenes were awkward and the movie had no point. the girl suzy was very beautiful but evil and crazy and the boy sam was ugly and weird. don't recommend this movie at all.
B009NPA3Y6|3.0|To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, the Rolling Stones are releasing six (count 'em, six!) chronological greatest hits albums: a budget two-CD, a standard three-CD, a deluxe three-CD, a deluxe five-LP, a deluxe Blu-Ray, and a super deluxe five-CD/one-EP collection. The best-of compilations are expertly remastered, albeit selectively edited for length, so while newer listeners probably won't notice anything amiss, nostalgic fans might.<br /><br />The two-disc bargain-bin set is adequate only for casual fans who just want some of their biggest hits and won't miss classic songs like \\"Time Is on My Side.\\" The first CD takes you from the band's earliest single, a 1963 cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Come On,\\" to \\"Wild Horses\\" on the 1971 album \\"Sticky Fingers.\\" The second CD starts with \\"Brown Sugar,\\" also from \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and ends with their final studio album in 2005, \\"A Bigger Bang,\\" plus two new studio recordings, \\"Doom and Gloom\\" and \\"One More Shot,\\" both of which harken back to the rough classic sound of the Stones.<br /><br />The first two discs of the standard three-CD version of \\"GRRR!\\" (33 out of 50 tracks) cover the Stones' early career, revisiting most of the required studio LPs and singles from the 60s up to the album \\"Black and Blue\\" in 1976. The third disc contains 17 recordings from the 1978 album \\"Some Girls\\" (though not the title track) to \\"A Bigger Bang,\\" plus the new songs. A 12-page booklet is enclosed. It's a big improvement on \\"Forty Licks,\\" the two-disc, 40-track, 40th-anniversary collection released in 2002. Of the four new tunes that appeared on that non-chronological album, only \\"Don't Stop\\" is recycled; 33 of the 36 remaining cuts are included on the three-CD edition (absent are \\"Mother's Little Helper,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" and \\"You Got Me Rocking\\"). These 33 are supplemented with a couple of mid-60s covers, Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\" and Howlin' Wolf's \\"Little Red Rooster,\\" and enough important songs from the Glimmer Twins to make a more satisfying package: \\"Time Is on My Side,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"As Tears Go By,\\" \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\\" \\"Respectable,\\" \\"Waiting on a Friend,\\" \\"Harlem Shuffle,\\" \\"Streets of Love,\\" and more.<br /><br />Compilations will never take the place of individual albums from the Rolling Stones' peak years, and they'll never please longtime fans like me who have no need for obvious radio fodder and want the rare stuff and the live stuff instead. There aren't a lot of surprises in the standard box, and the editing and inevitable omissions also reduce its value. Where are \\"Live with Me\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Dead Flowers\\" and \\"Hang Fire\\" and a dozen more? The skimpy two-CD set earns just three stars as it drops 10 songs from the three-CD set: \\"Time Is on My Side,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" \\"We Love You,\\" \\"She's a Rainbow,\\" \\"Highwire,\\" \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\\" \\"She Was Hot,\\" \\"Streets of Love,\\" and \\"Rocks Off.\\" If you're in the market for greatest hits, something to remind you of the Stones' awesome talent and staying power over the years, I'd spend a few extra bucks for the standard edition.he Glimmer Twins to make a more satisfying package: \\"Time Is on My Side,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"As Tears Go By,\\" \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\\" \\"Respectable,\\" \\"Waiting on a Friend,\\" \\"Harlem Shuffle,\\" \\"Streets of Love,\\" and more.<br /><br />Compilations will never take the place of individual albums from the Rolling Stones' peak years, and they'll never please longtime fans like me who have no need for obvious radio fodder and want the rare stuff and the live stuff instead.

1451613512|1.0|This book is scandalous for what it does not address. It is part of the global \\"cover-up\\" while at the same time demonstrating how consistently the U.S. government covers up. Therefore, aside from being unhelpful, the scandal of this book is the failure of its authors to make that leap of the imagination requiring them to understand what they are saying about American mythologies and then bravely assault the truly greatest myths confronted today as never before either in U.S. or human history: (a) that there is no scandal underlying the 9-11, 2001 disaster; (b) that no money (2-3 trillion tax-payer dollars) is missing and therefore we must reduce Medicare and Social Security, \\"entitlements\\" other than those designated for war or the military; (c) that we are the only intelligent beings in the universe and other entities who have succeeded living past their discovery of nuclear fission do not exist and if they did could not possibly reach us; and (d) the nuclear hourly threat of all nuclear power plants and bombs and global irradiation of fish and the northern hemisphere since Fukushima and the global lies associated with it. Come on, people. Uncle Sam's finger is pointing back atcha.

1451675046|2.0|I'm amazed at the glowing reviews which must have been written by adults based on their wishful thinking that children would somehow enjoy this admixture of old man's ponderous philosophical ruminations on the nature of abstract and factual thinking, the difference between religion (disguised as magic in the book) and \\"soft science\\" which cohabitates with fantasy. Condescending for smart children if you ask me and doubtful that many of them would bother reading it. This book is probably a passable introduction for children who are just beginning to wonder about the world at large but otherwise it is a book just about everything and about nothing. One learns absolutely nothing new from the book and it provides no insights or even new angles on the topics familiar to children from their regular school books. Some of the chapters and paragraphs were seemingly copied and pasted from the author's other by now way too numerous repetitive writings. If you expect something like really magical read \\"River Out of Eden\\" or truly edifying \\"The Ancestors' Tale\\" and you will not be disappointed regardless of your age.

B0068FYZIO|4.0|Schindler's list is about a German Businessman Oskar Schindler. Schindler who is a member of the Nazi Party during WWII, buys a factory to gain wealth as a war profiteer to produce army mess kits. To run his factory, Schindler hires Jews to work for him because the labor is cheaper than hiring Catholics. This also assures the Jews safety from being killed or sent to the concentration camps because they are helping the war efforts for the Germans. Schindler ends up having a change of heart once he wittnesses Jewish people being murdered in front of him and it bothered him to his core. This is when Schindler makes it his mission to save as many lives as he can. Schindler ended up spending his wealth on saving the Jew's who worked in his factory by buying off the Nazi guards and not producing any real product in his factory. This movie relates to world religions because it showcases the epic battle that humans have been fighting essentially since the beginging of time. The battle of how people with different beliefs don't understand one another and try to force the other to their way of understanding or belief, or to completely get rid of that belief altogether. In the case of this movie it is an extremist Christian \\"Hitler\\" who is trying to rid the world of the Jewish people.

B008LA7RM0|3.0|If you order this album you will receive a single disc with 26 cuts on it: 13 songs (two are just instrumentals) in Mono and the same 13 in stereo. It will arrive not in a traditional \\"jewel box,\\" but in a fold-out cardboard album like LPs used to be sold in, except of course much smaller, and without a paper liner around the disc, which is just shoved into one of the side compartments of the cardboard folder.<br /><br />This album is of great interest to rock and pop music historians, but if you are like most people who like \\"oldies\\" you will be getting merely three big hits (Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloop John B, and God Only Knows), along with 10 other songs that you've probably never heard before, because they are almost never played by \\"oldie\\" stations. This is because every one of those other 10, though they might sound fabulous to purists and golden-eared classic pop/rock aficionados, were originally considered \\"duds\\" commercially, which unfortunately is also how they will probably sound to the average oldie listener of today, who likely won't want to hear them again. So unless you are a die-hard collector or a music historian, you might want to consider saving some money by buying just the digital versions of the three big hits, rather than the entire album.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Just plain awful! Don't bother wasting your time. We couldn't even make it 30 minutes into movie. I seriously wouldn't trust anyone who likes this movie!!!
B00275EHJG|3.0|If customers want a movie that sums up all the darkness of the Toy Story franchise, this movie would be it. It's not bad, bad I have noticed that it does NOT have the fun that the other two Toy Story movies were, although to be honest, I found this movie a lot more interesting than Toy Story 2. What's dark about it is that Andy is grown up now, all the other minor toys are gone including BoPeep, Woody's true love, and the main Toy Story cast are the only ones left.They almost get thrown out, and end up in Sunnyside Day Care. At first it seems like the Toys are safe, but much like what happened with Pinocchio in Stromboli's theater, they are trapped by the evil Lots-O-Huggin' Bear. I really like how Lotso is cute and huggable on the outside, but pure evil on the inside. Also the knowledge that the toys in the Caterpillar Room get broken then thrown away in the garbage is horrifying. Confronting Lotso right before the garbage truck comes is a very intense scene for me as well as  the incinerator scene. The rest does not feel dark afterwards, but you do feel sad yet happy. So I hope viewers can handle all this.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love books like this and how they tell the story through the characters eyes, this book made me cry so much. :)
B0028O9W50|4.0|FANTASTIC CAST AND ACTING. EDWARD NORTON IS AWESOME (as he always is). HELENA BONHAM CARTER IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. BRAD PIT IS VERY GOOD. MEATLOAF is so REALLY, REALLY GOOD. The WRITING (script) and STORY is DELICIOUSLY COMPLEX and CLEVER. There is alot of VIOLENCE and alot of HUMOR. This movie is probably not for everyone (read the other reviews).<br />The SPECIAL FEATURES are a must to WATCH. They are very INTERESTING and GREATLY ENHANCE the film.<br />If you liked EDWARD NORTON in this movie. I will HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing him in PRIMAL FEAR with RICHARD GERE (who is very good). It is NORTON'S FIRST  movie and it IMMEDIATELY made him a STAR and won him an ACADEMY AWARD (1st movie!!). In PRIMAL FEAR (get the dvd with special features), he plays a character you will not soon forget!!! LIKE FIGHT CLUB--YIKES.
0446580848|4.0|Another great Nelson DeMille stoy.  We follow John Corey and his wife through a mine field of danger in Yemen. They are accompanied by plotting FBI and CIA agents.  Much of it is the journey, as we are acustomed to in Nelson DeMilles books as we are peppered with Corey's insight and wit. The last several chapters are filled with action and when the story is nearly over, you think, say it isn't so, I want to keep on reading.  I'm looking forward to DeMilles next book.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I never tire of rewatching this film.  KEVIN SPACEY is one of my FAVORITE actors and he is BRILLIANT in this role (he won an Academy Award for this performance). One MAJOR strength of this film is the incredibly POWERFUL ENSEMBLE CAST (chemistry for days). The other is the Academy Award WINNING SCREENPLAY that weaves a MESMERIZING tale that bends, twists, flips, and curves every way but the way expected. A MYSTERY WITHIN A MYSTERY. It's been around about fifteen years now, but if you haven't seen it, GET IT. THIS MOVIE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Love love love this movie. Michael Keaton and Catherine O'Hara make this movie one of the funnest to watch. My kids love the Day-O scene and can watch it a million times without a break. Perfect for Halloween.
B008KE3960|5.0|I never pay for games or IAP but this one has plenty of free game play. A nice new take on tower defence. I play on an og EVO so drawing the flight paths is sometimes frustrating but on a tablet or phone with larger screen it wouldn't be a problem. Let's just say it angered me but not enough to not give a 5 star.<br /><br />If you aren't going to pay for IAP then I suggest using your green gears to buy new maps first. You can only buy so many maps that way. I purchased planes first and now am trying to save up for new maps, playing the same maps over and over. My fault though.

030758836X|3.0|Nick and Amy Dunne seem to have the perfect marriage. They are bright, very attractive, and talented writers. Amy is the daughter of well-known psychiatrists who have created a series of children's books called \\"Amazing Amy\\", based upon their own daughter. But on their fifth anniversary Amy disappears from their Missouri home she shares with Nick, leaving behind signs of a struggle.<br /><br />As the media turn up to report the story of the missing beautiful \\"amazing\\" blonde wife, Nick's problematic behavior comes under increasing scrutiny. He doesn't seem to be the grieving husband that everyone wants him to be. As public suspicions turn  towards Nick, a closer look reveals the unraveling seams of the seemingly \\"perfect\\" marriage.<br /><br />Both had lost their jobs in New York and had moved back to Nick's hometown in Missouri. Amy was unhappy with the move. Nick was having an affair with another woman. Was this motive enough to want to harm Amy? Has Nick murdered her? Or is there any other reason for her disappearance?<br /><br />This very popular novel is interesting in that alternate chapters are \\"written\\" by Nick and Amy. I found this a little confusing at first, since Nick's chapters are at first written in the present and Amy's chapters, are told in the past tense, by necessity, from sections of her diary.<br /><br />There are several major characters in the book: Nick, Amy, Nick's sister Go, Amy's parents, Nick's senile father, Nick's selfish mistress, and several other key characters. As the story goes along, however, it becomes increasingly clear that none of the main characters are very likable, except perhaps Nick's sister, Go, who is a not a fully fleshed out character. As a matter of fact, most of the characters are pretty loathsome, and one of them is a certifiable psychopath.<br /><br />Flynn does have an amazing imagination, and is able to tell a great story for the most part. However, the book is quite graphic, and anyone squeamish about strong language and sex scenes should not read this book.<br /><br />The ending, which I shall not give away here, has been controversial. Some readers have not found it satisfactory, partially because not everything is resolved in a tidy little way. It may be somewhat realistic, however, noting the strange, twisted relationships that these people have. I find myself ambivalent about the ambivalent ending!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|One of the most awful books ever written.  Almost bad enough to be funny.  A parody of itself.  The first book was brainless but fun and vaguely titillating.  This one is just 'samey' but with a few additional characters thrown in to try to add an element of 'danger' which they entirely fail to achieve.  Childish plot, poor characterisation, simplistic almost spastic storyline.  Truly terrible attempt at a book. And just nit pick - the author has made pitiful attempts to research the vaguely 'technical' parts of the book.  As a pilot, I can tell you the radio calls are utterly nonsensical, had the author talked to any pilot she would have learnt that for herself. For example a pilot cannot clear themselves to take off, the tower must do that.  And pilots would never mix a phonetic call sign such as 'Charlie Tango' with spelling out the letters, eg PDX.  A pilot would say:  Charlie Tango, Papa Delta Xray.  This book is so bad I wish I could unread it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very good, concise, accurate information, from current conditions giving wind, humidity, real-feel temperatures, etc., through 36-hour summaries, to 10-day pictorial summaries. Other national and international cities can also be monitored.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Actually quite well written.  Interesting characters, interesting story, titillating sex.  The ending leaves you wanting more.  All in all - worth a read.  McDonalds writing for sure, but interesting.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Ok, you have to understand that I'm a guy who has one or two KISS CD's in my collection. I'm the first to be critical of KISS, and probably the last to give them credit. The two KISS recordings I have are \\"Creatures of the Night\\" and the other one being one of their greatest hits compilations (they have too many of those anyway). So this review is from a guy who is a lover of music with loud distorted guitars, but not a KISS fan at all. As a matter of fact where I have never hated them I have for the most part considered them to be one of the most over rated bands of all time. So me giving this CD 4 stars is saying something.<br /><br /> Monster is actually a very well put together CD. If your a KISS fan you should love this album!!!! If your a guy like me that could do without them you should still give this a listen. I broke down and gave this a shot after listening to samples on Amazon, and with the MP3 price for the album being $3.99 over this weekend it was worth a roll of the dice (sometimes you get a dud and sometimes you get a gem but for $3.99 it was well worth the gamble). I have to say WOW! This is actually a well written album for this genre, and it doesn't have any songs that I consider unpalatable (for the first time I didn't come across one song where I thought, \\"Why would you even release that\\"). Remember I'm about as far away from being a KISS fan as you can get without despising their music. I don't consider this CD ground breaking for in the year 2012 (like many other KISS recordings are considered), but I have to say I can listen to this CD all the way through. Something I have never been able to do with ANY other KISS album. I have always respected the musicians Paul and Gene have surrounded themselves with but have usually walked away disappointed with the over all result. Not so with Monster. It sounds like KISS but for the first time I'm not disappointed with the with most of the song writing. While I've usually only liked a song or two here and there by KISS I actually think these songs are better within the landscape of the compilation than they are outside of it. Which is to say the flow of the album makes the songs better than they would be by themselves.<br /><br /> Have I given 4 stars to albums I like much better than Monster? Yes, I can honestly say I like this album without being totally in love with it, but am also trying to be fair to the band. I can't give it 5 stars because where there are no bad songs in my opinion I can't say there are any groundbreaking ones either. So I'm trying to give a band I don't normally care for their just credit here. For a record that is good, fun to listen to, and just rock n' roll this album succeeds. Good job KISS, this album should make most of your fans happy, and should earn you new fans as well. Solid.and there by KISS I actually think these songs are better within the landscape of the compilation than they are outside of it.

B00012QM86|5.0|Shindler's List begins in 1939 Poland during World War 2, when the Germans had just overtaken the Polish army and taken control.  Under Hitler's command the Jew's were being blamed for all of the worlds troubles and were made to leave their homes, leave their belonging s and move into \\"ghetto's\\" to serve as labor forces. Oskar Schindler was a catholic man who was in Poland to try to make money.  He came up with the bright idea to begin a manufacturing business and use Jews to do the labor, because they would come so cheap.  He begins by hiring a Jewish accountant, Izthak Stern, to help him run the business and get some Jewish backers prior to their removal to the \\"ghetto\\".  Schindler's motive was not to save Jews, but to make a lot of money. But through the influence of Stern and seeing the horror going on around him he came to care for the Jews and want to help when he could.  He used his good standing as a member of the Nazi party and his connections with the German army to pull this off. He had also amassed a small fortune from his venture, that would turn out to be very valuable resource for keeping the Jews safe in the future. After some time the Jews were removed from the ghettos and transported to concentration camps to work as their labor force.  They were separated from their belongings and their families and the men and women were separated.  Mr. Shindler was allowed to set up his manufacturing plant within the camp to keep the workers he had safe.  When the time came that Hitler had passed down the order to dismantle the concentration camps and send all of the prisoners to Auschwitz Germany where many were being put to death in gas chambers.  He bribed German officials with the fortune he had amassed and was able to transport 1,000 Jews to his hometown to work in his factory to save them from certain death.<br /> This movie relates to world religion in that it is a very honest depiction of the Holocaust, which was not only a huge part of Jewish history and culture, but also a huge part of our worlds history.  It also touches on the principles of love and compassion, which is an integral part in many of our world's religions.

B00003CXA4|5.0|\\"Gandhi\\" is a beautifully written movie about the life and works of Mohandas K. Gandhi (called Mohatma Gandhi).  The film begins with the scene of Gandhi  surrounded by followers being shot, then leads you back into the life of Gandhi.  This scene shows  Gandhi is a young attorney getting  his first taste of racism, inequality and injustice as he is thrown off of a train in South Africa for being \\"colored\\" and travelling first class.  This sparked a fire in him that led him to stage his first campaign for justice and equal rights for the oppressed in South Africa, where he met with some success for his efforts.  He then decided to go home to India, a country he barely knew.<br />Gandhi's success in South Africa led to him being asked to lead a revolution for the independence of India from British law.  Gandhi was a Hindu that did not believe in violence as the means to an end and started a non-cooperation, non-violence campaign of freedom. He was successful in recruiting most of India to join him in his battle. He was a well loved and respected man that was able to reach many. This campaign met with success as well as some defeats.  Many were killed by the British army and many were imprisoned, including Gandhi himself on several occasions.  Ultimately, the campaign was successful as India received its' independence from Britain.  Gandhi was an old man by this point, but had never given up.<br />There is a sad turn of events at the conclusion of the movie, along with the independence of India came a civil war within India between the Hindu's and the Muslims of the country.  Unwilling to watch all that he lived for tear itself apart, Gandhi went on a hunger strike until the fighting stopped.  He almost died, but the fighting did indeed stop, but left a divided country with the Hindu's remaining in India proper and the Muslim populations renaming their parts of the country, Pakistan.  Even with his health being poor because of his advanced age and his refusal to eat for so long, Gandhi kept going in his quest for peace and went to visit the Muslims to teach peace and acceptance, but was killed by an insurgent while there.  I believe the most powerful moment of the movie is the very end, where they are showing his funeral pyre and then his remains being scattered in the ocean, when the voice of Gandhi says, \\"There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for some time they can seem invincible, but in the end they will always fall\\". What a powerful and true statement and a great way to end a great movie.<br />This movie relates to World Religion in its' portrayal of Hinduism as well as the Muslim faith.  Hindu's believe that all should be regarded as important and be loved, and that the way to bliss is to let go of your desire for possessions and passions.  This is portrayed beautifully by the life of Gandhi and is even spoken by his wife in the movie.

B001EN71CW|5.0|If you are a fan of this show theses discs are a must.  In addition to all the shows there are a ton of extras included.  Well worth the cost.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Intense, twisted, and full of surprises. I couldn't decide which main character I despised more, yet we all know people just like Nick and Amy. Incredibly well-written and planned by the author, I had no idea how the next page would end. So many possibilities, it was anything but predictable! I could not put this book down for a day and a half. I even called off appointments to finish reading. This is one of those rare books that could translate so well to film without losing credibility.
0380807343|3.0|I read CORALINE because I'd heard lots of people say they loved it. I did not love it. I did not much like it either. It didn't scare me. And I don't know if it would have when I was a kid either. It's hard to say. I think now, as then, I need more depth of story, more than the premise of a bright girl being ignored/neglected then scooted to a new reality, where she realizes \\"there's no place like home\\" and Mom.<br /><br />The best line of the book is the title of this review: \\"... after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see.\\" I absolutely believe this.
1451683405|1.0|Harris certainly knows nueroscience (I think), but he does not know psychology. People can change both their unconcious (his word0 and concious. thought patterns. How do I know? I've seen hundreds of people who were afraid of airplanes alter the patterns that drove their phobias and climb aboard. Harris is brilliant, but he needs to stick to what he knows.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'm trying to follow the ideas. I had no idea how much the wheat had changed over the last decade.
0307960471|2.0|Too many characters and subplots. Very suspenseful but left this reader disappointed. I will wait for the paperback next time.
B007L24T52|3.0|Good story but a bit transparent in the end. Still was interesting enough to keep me up at night. Not as good as the Camel Club books
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|this will b quick and painless. the trailer gave us what could have been an amazing movie but of course like many b4, the trailer is the best thing about the film. so many holes, so many characters so unbelievable, so many weak actors (charlene was about as believable as a 'captainl' than capt. crunch) and the story doesnt follow anything worth caring about. was so looking forward to this and disappointed beyond belief. when the bluray is in the 5.00 bin then will get it just to say i have it but cant imagine watching it till i forget how bad it was and then popping in bluray to remind myself of what could have been. missed opportunity, i would say 'yes'
1932100660|5.0|Very interesting and in many cases life changing book. I wish it becomes a required read for doctors and nutritionists..
0812550706|5.0|Really love all of the characters in Orson Scott Crards books.  Enjoyed this series especially.  Read all of the books in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Reading was fast moving in both books 2 & 3 with all the action going on. I'm not usually a big reader, but this kept me wanting to find out more. Final outcome is what I figured, but not the way I figured.  Really glad to have read the trilogy before any more movies come out.
030758836X|1.0|Not having ever read a book by Gillian Flynn before I came to \\"Gone Girl\\" with no idea of what to expect except it was supposed to be a very good mystery by a very good writer. All I can say is that disappointment doesn't quite make it as a description of what was written on the pages.There is barely a plot - and it is, in the end unresolved, the characters are wooden, the dialogue is terrible - people just don't talk like that, and the interior dialogue is even more pathetic. I have read bad books  before, but never one hyped this much that was this bad. Clearly Gillian Flynn must know someone in the publishing industry because otherwise I don't see the manuscript getting by a first reader, never mind being accepted and given such a huge budget for promotion. I guess the word that describes it best is \\"pathetic.\\" Thank-fully I didn't spend any money on it, but borrowed it from the library. Whew!
0812550706|3.0|I read this book because it was on one reviewers \\"top 25 books he's ever read\\" list, and sounded interesting. I was a little skeptical because I'm no longer a Science Fiction/Fantasy fan (loved it in my younger days), and that was the eventual \\"downer\\" in this book for me.  I did enjoy parts of it, and I did finish it, but the last third of it was very difficult going.  If you can believe a 6 year old boy in a distant future can have the judgment, leadership, and logic attributed to Ender, fine for you.  I didn't.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Its obviously a 5 star movie, but you add the bonus collection to it and it adds something more extra.. the behind the scenes are amazing to watch..the details have been so minute and the makers of the film had made sure that everything is just perfect. Must have if you are a fan!!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I had no problem with it until the last update. Now it force closes every time I use it.<br />I guess I'll have to go back to using swype.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm not professional in writting these review but I thought I received more than I expected when I purchased this book. I liked the stories told, the character development, and the usual parts that authors trip over or get tedious about didn't occur. It had none of those issues I normally find such as being overly descriptive, forcing characters where they want them to go, following cheezy overplayed themes, and more. This was an honestly good work and I want to read the next book. Thanks for a good story.
B007HJ91HU|4.0|Although I almost always detest the movie industry remaking movies that are the ultimate classic and original works this remake is worth watching. I loved the 80s music from the original soundtrack and was happy that the remake chose to keep the original soundtrack - with a little twist. The dancing isn't just grinding (which sums up what our generation's dancing consists of these days) and the characters back stories seem stronger. Way to go!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Simple game that has the potential to become addicting, like slots can be.  Easy mindless fun I find relieves stress.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I saw the movie last night and I am very, very surprised by the bad reviews in here. It is almost as if I had watched a different movie. I thought that this was one of the best action movies I have seen in years. I couldn't believe that someone would put this movie down so much. I know there some unbelievable stuff such as hot coffee in the eyes and nothing happened or the story which is a little convoluted but man, that woman looked hot! and nice! and beautiful! and she kicked a**!<br />Yes, I loved this movie very much. This movie will appeal to anyone who likes hot women, good action and women who beat guys.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I could not put the book down.  I thought the writing and storyline were both superb, however, I was highly disappointed by the way the author ended it.  That is, if you can call it an ending!
0316228532|5.0|I am really disappointed in the reviews given here! What were you looking for, the next Gone with the Wind? Give me a break! Harry Potter was a wonderful series, but life goes on, and adults need to get over it.<br /><br />I didn't realize Ms. Rowling had hoped I would cry at the end, but I certainly did! Casual Vacancy is a fascinating look behind the scenes in a small town that could be set anywhere. The British setting is one Americans remember from watching modern British sit-coms on PBS, but it could just as well have been set here in my hometown, yours, or someone's in South Africa!  I could even picture this as a Shakespearean-style tragedy. People don't change that much even after 500 years! Dickens wrote to reveal the underbelly of society, and J.D. Rowling has done this also, but in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />This is black comedy at its best. Remember Fargo? The kidnapped wife doesn't survive. Did you weep copious tears for her? But you enjoyed the rest, right? Well, these characters will make you laugh and cry too,but the results will make you think: how often do we drive by the homeless, the downtrodden, the small child with hunger for love written all over him and not see them? Or, tell yourself someone else is looking after them. Bigots, hypocrites, and corrupt politicians concerned only about themselves ignore their plight, and like dispassionate housecleaners, sweep it all under the rug, or worse still, use their plight to their own advantage. The misery and tragedy this causes must erupt somewhere, and in Rowling's story it cannot be denied! This story would make a great mini-series for tv.<br /><br />I hope you will read it and come to understand that J.D. Rowling can tell more than one kind of story, and tell it well!
B002LAM7PI|4.0|This is an ok type dvd for kids, (anomated) but just not my cup of tee. It's a good thing I have 2 grandchildren!!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This film is an amazing documentary that delves into the heights of perfection and the significant sacrifices made along the way to attain and maintain that elusive perfection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want it but no money and I can buy other games that are cheaper 2 so ya...... please lower your costs
B008YZXYY2|5.0|A great cd<br />You will keep it in your player for a long time perfect mix of hard and lyrics
B009D7CP2M|1.0|I would say that it’s pretty rare that I don’t finish a book that I start. Once I start a book, whether it’s good or bad, I feel compelled to finish it. Sometimes, though, I find a book that I just cannot get through. Unfortunately, We Need to Talk About Kevin is one of those books. I made it through about 14% of the book (thanks Stanza for allowing me to be weirdly specific with my percentages) and I’m surprised that I was able to make it that far. I feel badly about not finding the strength to finish this book, especially because it’s one I really wanted to read.<br /><br />The thing that sticks out for me was the writing. Shriver goes overboard with flowery language. While it might have been okay for Shriver to write while thumbing through a thesaurus the entire time, I dislike having to spend so much time looking up words in a dictionary while reading. Don’t get me wrong, I love expanding my mind and learning new words, but every third word is ridiculous! In general, this is probably what killed the book for me. It was too much work to get through the book.<br /><br />Since I wanted to read this book so much, I am going to watch the movie. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that it isn’t as painful as the book.
B008PNBU30|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite CD,s the cover art makes a very. Ice all over package. The cover art makes it worth buying the CD and not doing the download
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I love this app but it froze up my kindle for a week but still great!!!!!!!!!! id still recommend it to anybody
B008J34466|4.0|I really like this CD but not every song is great, the cover art is nice but nothing to write home about. You would be better off downloading the songs you like. But do check it out there are some really great songs
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Enjoyed this game but didn't like how long it takes energy to build up. Also don't like the fact that you have to spend real money to get energy.  Just charge me for the game and give me what I need.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This is a great CD<br />You will listen to it over and over and years from now you will sing along any time you hear a song. Defiantly worth the money!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Starts a little slow but this season is just as good the other seasons.  Great character development amd good mix of drama and action.
B0051GOB26|4.0|Purchased for my fiance for a birthday gift. His copy of the movie was lost when we had a fire in our home in 2011. We were not aware of the loss of the DVD till we moved into our new home and started unpacking and realized that we had the case but no cd and then realized it was in our DVD/BlueRay player that was ruined in the house fire. Great clarity in picture and price was decent.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Heat Wave was a very good book. It played out like a longer episode of 'Castle' but it did sometimes lack some of the refinement of the show. The banter was good but lacked a little kick to it from everyone involved not just Rook and Heat. Overall I enjoyed it because I love the show so much and just can't put down a book for good once I've started it. So in that respect it was entertaining but not a classic to reread over and over.
B00908DDZM|5.0|he is a new wave of rap, Hip-Hop needs to grow, culturaly and emotionaly and this guy is right for the job, im very impressed of his ability to attack forbidden issues and give his Constructive point of view.
B00417HV14|5.0|I caught an abbreviated version of this concert on TV and it blew me away. The complete concert on this blu-ray disc is a must buy for any blues rock fan. Bonamassa is not only one of the best guitar players I've ever heard, but also puts on an incredible live performance. I could watch this concert every day and never get tired of it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game. its super fun because there are so many games to choose from. my favorite game to play is the one with sushi
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Bonamassa is one of the most talented guitar players I've ever heard. This is an excellent follow-up to his Royal Albert Hall performance.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was awful. Could not go any further than 95 pgs and that was a chore. I skipped to the last 50 pgs just to make sure there wasn't some great twist I would miss and what a waste!  Like a friend of mine said, good thing she has Harry potter seris to pay the bills.  Don't waste 16 bucks on this book
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game for puzzle people! Easy to learn, hard to master. New boards added often enough that you'll never run out. Most pictures are easily recognizable but a few are hard to see at first.
B008NA3I30|1.0|This is one of the absolutely STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen.  I need eight more words, hmmm.  THIS IS A STUPID MOVIE!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Product fit as it was advertised.  The Kindle Fire HD snapped easily into the case.  The protection for the Kindle is more than adequate.  For the price, this is an excellent bargain.
B006B7LQ90|4.0|After finishing my marketing diploma I decided to dig deeper about all concepts I've learned. One of these concepts was \\"Positioning\\" and the best title you will ever find for this concept is this book. If you are working in marketing communications field this book is a MUST read for you. If you are an entrepreneur who is after a quick marketing advice this book isn't for you, As you will not find actionable advices which you can apply in your business.<br />For me it was a great read and it has enriched my marketing knowledge except some contradictions authors did fall in which made me pretty distorted about when should I use this concept and when shouldn't I do.
B000XXGMS8|4.0|I need to start by saying that I've only had these boots for a couple weeks, so I can't make any bold statements about their long term durability. That said, they look and feel like they're going to hold up just fine. These boots look great, they can even pass for psuedo-dress shoes if you're wearing pants that hide the boot above the ankle. Besides being stylish, they are quit comfortable with one condition (see below).<br /><br />IMPORTANT!!!! Order these boots a 1/2 size smaller than your normal shoe size.<br /><br />I normally wear a 10.5-11, but I ordered these boots in a size 10 and they are a touch on the large size. (Nothing a pair of wool socks won't cure).<br /><br />Cons: While these boots are great for general around town and light duty, I would not recommend them for backpacking/ long distance hiking. They are a bit heavy, and the tongue isn't gusseted (meaning you'll get a lot of pebbles and sticks in your boot).
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Kids have enjoyed viewing the dvd on many occasions.  We would gladly recommend this company to friends and family.  Very satisfied.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie.
B009JZPH32|2.0|I thought this movie would be thrilling and exciting.  But in the end, I was really just disappointed that I had wasted the 2 1/2 hours watching it.  The 3some love triangle was weird and even some of the violence was unnecessary.  There were some exciting parts and I was not bored but for the most part I was just ready for it to be over.
8862931921|5.0|The A4 style should cover the bases for all kinds of writers and artists. Its a great take-a-long work book, or permanent repository. I just wish it (and this is true of the entire Moleskin line) were not so expensive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a wonderful game that's addicting n I liv it. its really pricey so make sure you tell yurt mum for permission. overall it is gorgeously awesome
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|Some interesting information that reflects the statement in the title of the book.  However, there are many descriptions of studies, personal anecdotes and experiences of others.  To me, these are fillers and take too much time to read.  The messages you would hope to take away from reading this book could have been presented in a few chapters.
034580404X|5.0|Arrived timely in great condition & the books themselves are a great, enticing, inspiring read!<br />I truly hope a movie is to follow, even if it goes straight to video!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This CD is GREAT. The only problem I had was with the DVD that comes with it. Only three songs...........
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought the book was great! I wish there were more times with Greg and his family. Other than that it was great!
B005LAII3A|5.0|I actually thought this new rendition was better than the first one. GASP! I know. I must not be a science fiction fan, or a fan of real movies, or blah, blah, blah. No. I just thought Schwarzenegger's cardboard acting combined with the cheesy dialogue and mediocre action scenes made the original movie, overall, a subpar film. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is great, but we can thank Phillip K. Dick for that. It's nostalgia that makes the original a classic. I just don't see how anyone can think the performace Schwarzenegger put on was lightyears ahead of Colin Ferrell's. I just don't see it. Not saying Ferrell is some Oscar worthy actor, but some of the hate this movie is getting is just ridiculous. I thought it was full of action, great storylines, and wonderful special effects. Plus, Kate Beckinsale in her underwear...worth the five stars alone. I don't think this is some movie of the year or something, but I think people are comparing it to the original a little too much, and if you just take it for what it is, a rendition of a classic film, you may enjoy it more.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a great book. I could not put  it down. I would recommend it to anyone. My boyfriend loved it too!
B009WJ2HDS|5.0|Manu makes great records for Manfred.  There is no doubt.  The compositions are always crisp and the music is played sympathetically.  His opener for ECM, Neighborhood, was impossibly slick and polished.  An admirable quality, but I want to hear things free up a bit.  The subsequent records have gradually leaned in this direction, and, fortunately, the fourth offering creeps the furthest in this direction.<br /><br />As always, music boils down to the sound, and the sound here is rich and lush.  Katche's drums in particular are unmistakable, and he's almost the stickler Paul Motian was in how his instrument sounds.  Almost.  Molvaer is a welcome addition to Manu's horn section.  I miss him on ECM.  His career should have taken off and been huge stateside, he's a freaking brilliant trumpeter.  Brunborg continues as Katche's foil, I think Manu has a saxophone in his soul.  I wish Mr. Watson had tickled the keys on the hammond a bit more.  Manu's drums under two horns with the B3 setting the scene is a brilliant and memorable sound.<br /><br />I am loving the Katche career on ECM, and this is a worthy follow-up.  Five stars?  Not nearly enough.  700 stars.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This is one of the few times I should have followed the reviews.  I found the movie to be boring, and disappointing.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I received the CD on or before the expected date, it was exactly what I had hoped for musically, I would do it again.
0316789798|5.0|This book is very helpful in my job working with elementary school aged children. It is fun to see their improvement in artistic ability on a weekly basis. I'm finding that it has also helped me to become a better \\"artist\\". There are many fun animals to draw and different ways to change characteristics of each animal. It's lots of fun.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|the book was well written telling a compelling story as Folletts other books. I am disappointed in the use of sexual content that did not seem relevant to the time period. not as believable as his previous character bdhaviors. great historic fiction.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book is fast reading; once you start reading you do not want to stop. The middle section held more suspense than the ending. Select this if you are on an airplane or waiting at the doctor's office.
0316286850|5.0|Any book by Kevyn Aucoin is must have for a MUA! This man has insights that can help anyone work their face or a face like a pro. Love his wisdom and industry insights. Get it!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I was surfing my amazon prime instant videos and came upon this movie by luck. I knew nothing about it nor recognised any of the listed staring actors. At a $3.99 rental fee for an evenings entertainment at home I figured what the hey. What a delightful surprise. Once into the movie I recognized some very fine costars and supporting actors and actresses in Donald Sutherland with superb but very little screen time, Woody Harrelson, who also put in a fine performance,the always enjoyable Stanley Tucci who is just absolutely on fire in Television and movie roles, and Elizabeth Banks (The 40 year old virgin and Seabiscuit. I did not see the burning Plain but it doesn't surprise me that the lead Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an Academy award as she put in just a stellar performance in this movie. This was a very well made movie that keeps ones interest throughout with no weak, dull, or boring moments.
1401924751|3.0|These cards felt plastic to me instead of deep like some of D.V's other cards. I didn't find them affective at all in matching me correctly with what my purpose was/is but it did allow me to think about it though. I would get them if your not clear at all but keep your reactions light as they may not provide you with the direction your actually looking for.
1449410243|5.0|This was purchased as a gift...but being a cat target meself...coud not resist a peek ( careful to keep the pages looking,, well you know...newish looking)  It was as true as it was funny... sure  the giftee.. will enjoy it too...if his cat will let him.+
0446581356|5.0|AS a MUA this book is a wealth of information from one of the industry's makeup gurus. Bobby B has come a long way baby and she offers some powerful insights in this book. I have read it twice already! I like how she approaches her makeup and offers you some guidance on how you can improve your application either on a personal level or professionally.  The only thing I did not like about it was trying to get involved her discount as a MUA, you have to have literal experience in the field where other famous MUA or makeup companies allow you to be a student and get discounts. I also don't like the fact that her products are so expensive for very little product. So, I can't say I have tried her products but plan on it in the future. But I do recommend this book for new MUA or for the MUA that wants to follow this trend of &#34;natural makeup&#34; like BB.
0143038419|4.0|Great book, easy read.  Provided sooo many things to think about.  What do we want as individuals, why are we here, what is truly important, etc.  Gave me much food for thought.  How many of us as real adults wonder about the choices we've made, what we've lost, what we've yet to discover and what is important?<br /><br />The down side is that taking a year off to figure things out is not realistic for 90% of the population.  If I were given a $200k advance from a publishing house, I could certainly take the time to rediscover me.  Without that backstop, it really isn't possible.<br /><br />Many say she was self absorbed or selfish.  It may appear that way, but I think it speaks more to human nature.  I don't think anyone, no matter their years or station in life, hasn't thought about where they are, what could have been and what they truly want.  If you can say this doesn't fit you, I believe you are either very young (and haven't experienced much) or you're too busy going thru the motions to care.<br /><br />Great book.  Great ideas.  Great insight and experiences.  Realistic - a big NO.  Nonetheless, it was an easy easy read that gave me food for thought.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I think most of Christina Aguilera's studio albums are of superb quality. Even though Bionic was not commercially successful, there were some seriously exceptional songs in there too. I love that she keeps experimenting with her music, and in this album, she collaborates with musicians of different genres, even country. Her voice is gorgeous and empowering, as always. Lotus Intro, Blank Page, Red Hot Kinda Love, Just A Fool, Circles, and Light up the Sky are my favorites so far.
B008BSPQ3E|4.0|This box set is thoroughly fulfilling. Better than I expected really. The remastered album (both cd & vinyl) sounds great. Listening to So DNA and experiencing the evolution of the songs was so interesting. The love concern was incredible. The book insightful.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, except for one reason. When I opened my package, multiple pages of the book were ripped. I was disappointed, because I wanted to dig right in, but I thought I paid $100 for this box set, I should have one in pristine condition. When I tried to return it, amazon notified me that my only option was a refund because the package was sold out.  I decided to just live with it because I wanted to experience everything and had been looking forward to it from the day I preordered it, but honestly it left a bad taste in my mouth that I remember (and have to retell) every time  I show a friend the box set and they flip through the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's an omg season with cliff hangers and surprises galore.  The fourth episode could have been the finale.  What's up with the Governor?
0738212415|5.0|With no knowledge or previous experience, and unable to affort personal lessons, this did a good job getting me started.  The pace is slow but in the end worthwhile because it reinforces basic skills.  While not a great artist, I can actually create a credible drawing.  Which for someone with no talent, is quite an accomplishment.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"I hope there's a good movie on this flight.\\"<br /><br />The above is said by a U.S. commando as he secretly boards a hijacked civilian plane.  (Two flight attendants on this plane are played by Halle Berry and Marla Maples Trump, former wife of \\"The Donald.\\")<br /><br />This is what this movie is about: a group of commandos attempting to take back control of an Oceanic Airlines Flight 343 Boeing 747.  Actually, it's a bit more complicated.<br /><br />You have to get anti-terrorist commandos secretly onboard a hijacked plane that's in flight and make sure all 406 passengers are not harmed.  As well, the Islamic terrorists have a sophisticated and deadly nerve gas (\\"DZ-5\\") bomb on the plane that will explode if there's an attempt at landing.  Detonation is controlled remotely by a terrorist disguised as one of the passengers.  (This person is known as the \\"sleeper\\" or \\"trigger man.\\")<br /><br />The leader of the terrorists is the ruthless Nagi Hassan (David Suchet, taking on quite a different role from his excellent portrayal of Agatha Christie's Inspector Hercule Poirot).<br /><br />A plan to save the plane and passengers is concocted by government officials with the help of Dr. David Grant (Kurt Russell) who is a \\"consultant to U.S. military army intelligence,\\" commando leader Lieutenant Colonel Austin Travis (Steven Seagal without his ponytail), and engineer Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt).<br /><br />Everything does not go according to plan.  Four commandos (one played by John Leguizamo as \\"Rat\\" and another one played by Joe Morton as \\"Cappy\\") get secretly onboard the hijacked plane that`s in flight.  By accident, Dr. Grant and engineer Cahill also wind up on this plane.<br /><br />Steven Seagal fans will be disappointed.  He only appears in the first 45 minutes of this movie.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|I think it's crazy to review an album the first couple times you hear it, so I can honestly say I listened to Koi No Yokan about twenty times before I even thought about reviewing it. Diamond Eyes blew my mind and I knew this would not disappoint.<br /><br />Swerve City -<br />The album opens with a bang of riffs then envelopes into the crooning Chino we all love, mixed with an atmospheric swirl of keyboards. Cure ambience echoes in those crying guitars.<br /><br />Romantic Dreams - Hypnotic guitar broken by the synch of drums / vocals..... Then it gets threatening. \\"I promise\\".... Is more convincing than Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode at full emotional throttle? Wow. The guitars rain down a heavy thick sludgy atmosphere where Chino Moreno vocals hover so lightly over. The last of the song is a memorizing 30 second journey...<br /><br />Leathers - If you haven't heard this, do. After an 80's Fright Night malingering of strange trace guitar in the first 35 seconds, it explodes and tears off your face and pounds, pounds, pounds...ANGRY.. GUNS! RAZORS! LEATHERS! This is one of the heaviest songs on the album... IMO<br /><br />Poltergeist - The click clack intro sets you up for a trap door of echoing screams followed by melon collie singing over bone crushing riffs. Like an onion, this song goes layers and layers deep, using the atmospheric keyboards in the advantage, while separating guitars, drums and screams.<br /><br />Entombed - Intertwining guitars going down a very subtle path equal to a gentle rainstorm. Chino lightly sprinkles over the guitars until everything ups a level with a more passion. \\"Shapes of colors are all I see. Shapes of colors are all I feel.\\" The song almost dies, but quickly is brought back to life to the confessional cries of Chino...<br /><br />Graphic Nature -  Harmonics never sounded so good, followed by confronting chunky riffs. Liquid Sex...\\"I'm aware of the demons that you've tucked away\\".... Wow... This will be an awesome song to see live...<br /><br />Tempest - This was the first single. I played it in the car and my wife quickly complained it would put her to sleep as she drove my drunk ass to the bar. \\"Lay there\\"... how quickly this songs jumps back into Deftones awesomeness.... Thrust..Thrust..Thrust.. Echoing... Ahead... Ahead... Ahead... \\"Turning in circles....\\" And how beautiful it sounds just to be equally wrapped in all that distortion... the drums just go, go, go... Awesome song... The end just builds up to.....<br /><br />Gauze - I kept having to turn down the stereo because I thought there was outside activity.. All the beeps and echoing noises... Man, I am so happy to hear these guitar roll-offs in between the riffs.. I didn't notice them until the last few listens.. So cool... The atmospherics are just as cool and impressive as \\"Diamond Eyes\\"... I love the passion..Chino just sings his ass off like Ian Asterbury and delivers with such a passion and rage combined it transgresses a passionate rage that you're forced to digest.<br /><br />(Getting another beer)<br /><br />Rosemary - Surprisingly, my favorite song on the album. I LOVE HEAVINESS, but this seems like the ultimate calm before the storm. It sounds like an alternate Smashing Pumpkins \\"MACHINA\\" universe with an angrier vocalist... This song is so thick on atmosphere, you are looking out the corner of your eyes for anything incoming, because you know things are lurking and about to attack... Pure beauty. A nice time to catch you're breath. After the MACHINA guitar build ups and calming breaks..<br />Out of no where, the ugliest guitar pops out and Abe Cunningham turns into Dale Crover from the Melvins and just pounds, allowing perfect synchs between the guitar and the beat. Personally, I almost had a wreck with the near ending to this song and was extremely disappointed it didn't go on with just the riff and drums for another 20 minutes... I have to make a remix and mix this song with \\"Cow\\" by the Melvins, just for personal use...the best part of the entire album is the transition between these songs... The song ends on a calming gentle stream of tranquility... and transitions to the nect song....<br /><br />Good Squad - Still not fully realizing that Rosemary was over, I can feel everything getting tenser and tenser and tenser...A sudden electronic ocean passes over me and the next thing I know.. THE DIAL IS SET TO 10 AT FULL WHITE BOY MODE.. and I'm about to show it. You know, slam dancing in the middle of the interstate drunk on Mickey's... Holy Shit... This is the most unexpected song to rip it apart... LOVE IT! LOVE IT!<br /><br />What Happened to You? - A very nice calming ending to a very beautifully hidden brutal album. I hope chino can keep hitting these high notes after belting out an album of aggression.the best part of the entire album is the transition between these songs...

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was so much fun. I played this with my 5 and 8 year old kids and they loved it. The graphics are great and the story line is very well written. Can't wait to play the sequel.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I love this movie! This is one of those movies that you have to watch more than once to really appreciate it. Even though they've been showing it on TV, I really wanted to have this in my collection.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|I love this game. A gotta have. It does crash sometimes but I think that's when the Batt gets low.but I play it all the time. the only thing I hate is you cannot kill the yeti at all with his crush of 999. that's rediculous. Im on level 41 and still playing.
B007N8RULO|5.0|No matter how many times I play this game, I never get tired of it. It's difficult to win and that's what I prefer.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|If you are looking for a thought provoking novel, look somewhere else.  If you want a QUICK read of a simple story this is for you. It's completely predictable, but nevertheless entertaining. It smacks of many other novels of the cozy genre with a detective-wannabe heroine and her cop boyfriend, but the story line is less well developed. There is even the obligatory cute pet-a little dog of unknown breed.
141659521X|4.0|After a two book diversion to look at Mitch Rapp's back-story, here we are back in the present.  In fact very much the present as a top CIA asset is kidnapped in Afghanistan and the knowledge he holds could put a great deal of the CIA's intelligence gathering at risk.  Mitch Rapp is sent out with a small advance team to try to track down the kidnappers before it is too late.  After a while it appears there is another agenda at play although what it is and who is behind it, is not obvious.<br /><br />Mitch Rapp is a force of nature and as readers it is always a pleasure to see him `go off on one' but I think author Vince Flynn has realised his books must be more than Rapp confronting people aggressively.  This book is not all about Rapp and has a fair taste of politics and duplicity in there.  Pakistan's intelligence agency and it's relationship with the USA is painted in an interesting way that exposes the conflicts and agenda, and wisely does not make this about another big terrorist plot.<br /><br />Have to say I enjoyed this, it was an intelligent and complex novel.  Some interesting changes by the author, Rapp is injured and there is some interesting exploration of his character, Mike Nash is very much pushed into a back seat, and Irene Kennedy is now far more confident in her role and her leadership.<br /><br />One minor slip up (a character is discussed in a meeting Rapp attends and whose name has been withheld from him, but Rapp doesn't react, but later in the book he does react as if hearing for the first time - just a continuity error but it did confuse me at the time) and some opportunities not fully followed up but this remains a well rounded and intelligent novel.
B0095R64AO|1.0|What a waste of $4!  We only watched for 30 minutes before turning it off.  They drop the F bomb every 5 minutes it seems for no reason whatsoever.  Don't waste you're time or money!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|i love this album. christina aguilera did a great job on making this album. my daughter loves this album plus she was dancing to some the songs. ever since i got this album today,i been playin it alot. its one the best album christina ever made.it was worth the money to buy it. i love all the songs on the album cause there not one song that i didnt like. i love the duet with blake and it was amazing to hear Christina and Blake sing a song together.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Be carefull.  This little game is addictive and will lead to hours and hours of fun challenges.  It also leads to buying other cheap vesions for other devices.  Like our Kendle.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|A lousy movie and a waste of time.  I don't know what other people see that is so good.  Long winded, totally obscure to me and I found it impossible to follow.  Maybe it is a culture thing  and you have to be a reader of the comics and already be know these weird characters.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Really great app I would like to be able to search my friends by their real name not just their username and have more than one person come up when i search.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Dirty Dancing doesnt get any better than this! This a type a movie that will stand the test of time, never losing its appeal.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|author writes well showing consideration for  the lay audience ;however,the reader should keep in mind that there is still a great deal of mystery and speculation about the field of quantum mechanics
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|Trajan has to be the most amazing game of the past year for me.  The options you have while playing are immense and after the first play through it's intuitive on your options, but will take a ton of time to master.  This game hits the table almost every time I'm with my gaming group.  You have to own this for your collection!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a very moving tale about young children overcoming their problems. I read this book because I enjoyed the movie. You may want a box of tissues handy when you read this book.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Everyone who's read the reviews for Friends Blu-Ray knows why it's a bad bargain. I'm writing in order to add yet one more one-star review to the already impressive collection of them on Amazon. To Warner Bros.'s credit, it does state on the front of the box I bought that these are the original NBC episodes. To their discredit, it does not explain why they felt it necessary to mention the subject at all. There were, apparently, several hours of extended material on the DVDs. All of that in a HD format probably would have meant one or two Blu-Ray discs to the 21-disc collection. That's why they did it; but they should have been more forthright in their explanations. Thank God for Amazon reviews!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Dont mind the noise in the market......this should not be a #1 seller! I wish i could un-buy this book! This is a copy cat of Twlight and Twlight is much much better than this! I will not be purchasing the rest!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|All of the Harry Potter films were great, I would not recommed this for the little ones can,t wait for the last one...
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book is a world best seller and it is not hard to see why.  There is little in the narrative which is original and one could cite a whole range of distopian novels and films as inspiration but one also has to acknowledge the skill with which the story is related for the young adult reader ship.  The scene has been set for the following novels in the series and you never know I might actually buy them!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Yet again the Harry Potter films come out on top, it is a shame that they have finished now but can,t wait to watch them all together
B0076794IO|5.0|I was initially confused at the different time zones but once I despised the pattern I could not put the book down. I am not particularly fond of technical jargon but was intrigued by the plot involving cyber theft. The way the author kept you in suspense and routing for the two main characters was cleverly done. I would recommend this novel to everyone.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing IMO. The world Sanderson presented in this book is so entirely alien and even hostile compared to most fantasy titles out there. Even the grass reacts to people, the animals are either mutations or just another result of events preceding the story. The backgrounds and storys are deep and complex yet still relatable. the intrigue is outstanding. even the love story. the magic system/s in this book is/are even more complex than in his Mistborn series. obviously i'm no writer myself. but as a reader i say this one book by itself and the series it begins is on par with the entirety of Jordan's Wheel of Time.
B00914JWSW|3.0|I was disappointed in this CD.  I have been a Streisand fan for over 40 years and this is the 1st time I have been disappointed in one of her products.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Having shirttail relatives who owned a Frank Lloyd Wright house I had somewhat of a personal interest in the subject. The author kept you interested in the long term affair of Frank Lloyd Wright and the wife of a former client during an era when the public had no tolerance for those who left their spouse and children to cavort with a new partner.<br /><br />The storyline is engaging and keeps you turning the pages hoping for some sort of a solution for themselves and their families. It gives you insights into FLW's artistic genius, business, and career. There is also an interesting side story about the women's movement at the time.<br /><br />Characters are well developed. You feel like you have looked into the souls of Frank and Mamah, but you may not like what you see. I kept wondering how that previously mentioned shirttail relative could have literally lived with Wright while his home was being built and still had such a huge respect for the man. (I wouldn't have invited the guy in the book to my house for a cup of coffee.)<br /><br />Loved the story, but not the characters.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I really enjoyed Anita's story and feel that it gave me some strength, power & insight into life. Learn to live, love and have a fun life! Don't be so serious....
B00931JMRE|5.0|I am amazed how this group keeps going and performs their form of cool Texas rock. Even when there are similarities with their previous work, they keep me interested throughout this album.
B009B2VBWE|4.0|Great sound as usual and sooo sexy! I believe these are all new songs by her...not sure because I've only listened once...
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Good comic book on screen, but I suppose I just could not keep my interest in this film. I am sure younger viewers may like this more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it because it combined happy and sad. Also it makes you raise that you should be grateful for all you have and that you don't have to go through all the troubles little August had to go through.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, unfortunately it has an even bigger cliffhanger than the first book. Just come on and over throw the capital already
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I've tried a number of relaxation/sleep apps and this if my favorite. The change I would like to see would be grouping similar sounds together. Like putting the different rain sounds together.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|This is more of a girls day kind of cd, but it is really good. Definitely recommend it to the Taylor swift fans.
B00A12Z264|5.0|reviewer PA  here,  watch out the things u say. if u dont believe in karma,  thats the sadest things and i feel sorry for u !!!  u have no decency at all.<br /><br />p.s. I couldnt agree more with reviewer here named *elisabeth rutman*
B008L1PYQU|3.0|When i was a kid, the first album i ever purchased was KISS Destroyer.  I was hooked and a devout KISS fan ever since.  This album did it for me on so many levels growing up, so when I found out they were going to be re-issuing it for the 30th anniversary, I was pretty excited.<br />Destroyer &#34;Ressurected&#34; is good.  But it could have been done a lot better.  Here is how I would have done it:<br />More out takes and alternate tracks:  Except for one alternate guitar solo on Sweet Pain, that is it.  Nothing else.  I'm sure there are some other tracks and takes ( heck, even Paul doing &#34;God of Thunder&#34; made it onto the box set ), that could have been added here.  So to get only one track is nothing spectacular.  This should have easily been a double album, at the least.<br />Leave the original album insert:  Although I liked Bob Ezrin’s comments, I would have preferred a separate insert with his comments listed, and then have the original inside liner ( with the lyrics to “Detroit Rock City” and KISS Army Shout It out Loud ) holding the album.  As it stands, they omitted the “Detroit Rock City” lyric side and put a re-print of the original Destroyer artwork on the alternate side.<br />Leave the original Destroyer artwork:  I do appreciate the story behind the Resurrected artwork.  But that should have been left for the inside of the album.  To me, it pales in comparison to the way Destroyer was originally issued.  Ace Frehley, particularly, looks pretty bad.  Plus, the destroyer outfits were much better than the Alive outfits.  In my opinion, the best outfits they ever wore.  I would have placed the alternate album cover artwork inside, along with a detailed description of how it was changed at the last minute and why.  Also, some notes from Ken Kelly would have been nice.  This album cover was iconic is so many ways.  To just have a new one put on there, with no explanation or additional comments from Ken, takes away from the re-issue.<br />Musically, it isn’t bad.  You can hear some of the subtle nuances that previously were hidden, or buried deep within the tracks.  The bass is more noticeable.  The guitar on “Beth” is more prominent.  All in all, a good re-mastering on the tracks.<br />I would recommend this album only to the die-hard KISS fan.  And even then, it is lacking on what could have been a really great anniversary tribute to an iconic album from an iconic band.sically, it isn’t bad.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I like. that the pigs strike back and that the levels are easy and that it is fun and I like
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I'm a major Star Trek fan. This is one of the best. Didn't think I'd like to see the young growing up characters. I was wrong. Stupid great.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I watched this movie with my husband, we both gave it 4 stars.  We thought it was gonna be more action packed and thought that the 2 guys were gonna kick some extreme butts to get the girl back... but, they would kick butt and then lay low.... the action was very up and down.  Still cool, but I wouldn't buy it for my movie collection, it was fun to watch once.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very engaging--creative plot-kept the reader's interest since the outcome was well concealed-I wanted to keep reading to the resolution-you will enjoy it
0446580848|2.0|The Panther is a 600+ page book containing about 200 pages of story.<br />Nelson DeMille needs an editor who has the guts to tell a best-selling icon author to tighten up his story and cut out the waste.<br />At first I was put off by the wise-guy remarks sprinkled liberally thruout the book, then I was annoyed, then, finally disgusted. The constant snarky comments/thoughts/asides are better suited for  skit on SNL than for a supposedly taut, thrilling novel about a terrorist mastermind and his plot to...well, do something to someone.<br />The book starts out well enough with a chapater showing THe Panther ruthlessly murdering tourists, but whenever Corey, the hero is center stage, the books goes off the skids into parody. That happens enough to destroy the feel of tension and danger that should build as the pages roll enterminably on.<br />It is just not believeable that Corey would be married to the FBI agent wife so different from he is in every way. There really is no feeling of sparkling love there. He is a wild-cannon, drunk, smart-mouth; she is a disciplined and focused.What may have worked in earlier books, does not in this mish-mosh.<br />It seems that DeMille, like some other big-selling authors relies on past reputation for taut thrillers to get by with a sloppy job such as The Panther.<br /><br />Read Vince Flynn, Alex Berenson and get your money's and thrill's worth.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This is a fun game, however after you win a bingo, it wouldn't let you play without paying per card
B0074MTTEK|5.0|This book combines details and clear explanations that make epigenetics really understandable. What I read before about epigenetics left me thinking how fascinating the topic is but never explained as well as this book just how epigenetics actually works.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book. So much better than 50 Shades of Grey. This is an easy read and so much more interesting. Ready for the 2nd book.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Would give five, but interface is just a little glitchy now and then. Hard to remove pieces, etc. But it keeps me engaged for long periods of time, which is more than I can say for most other games.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is lots of fun. I love playing it whenever. I recommend for everyone of all ages! Now, go have fun!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It has a lot of romance, but also psychological insight.  If you don't like outright sex, don't buy either book.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|So much can be said with so little words.  And the song, Walking on the Air has become a classic.
B009329ZF2|2.0|So... aliens arrive and splash down in the ocean on earth.  They are sophisticated because they somehow got here at faster than the speed of light, but that aside the vessels they arrive in are giant and laborious crafts that are somehow stuck in the surface of the ocean, leap-frogging around in their attack on mankind.  Ummmm... yeah.  Further, these sophisticated beings have amazing weaponry, right?  Wrong.  They lob (inaccurately most of the time) these weird canisters that tend to do their job.  Lobbing is an advanced system of weapon deployment?  I don't get it.  Story line is boring and predictable.  The lead actor is a jerk and you never really want him to do well because he does NOT deserve it, but you know it is coming.  He will save the day, redeem himself to the world, and win the girl even though he is still a jerk in the end.  Two stars for the semi-hot blonde and tech effects, but other than that it was just a sell out.  Too bad because with just a bit more effort it could have been as exciting as the trailer.  Boo director, producer and anyone else that didn't step up to say this movie is going to be stupid.<br /><br />Update... if you are looking for a great ALIEN INVASION MOVIE, watch [[ASIN:B004ULEEY8 Battle: Los Angeles [Blu-ray]]]!  What an incredible film.  Kicks the S*** out of Battleship.
B007L6VR12|3.0|Moonrise Kingdon had good actors but not much of a story line. Could have been better based on the talent that put it together.
B008KE3960|2.0|fun game. caughed up $ for the bonus pack. got the helicopter and gear doubler but not the promised 1000 gears and 5 bombs.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|omg read the book an watched the movie it makes me cry thinking this is the last one ever i really hope there will be a book that comes next year 2013 the movie is a lil better than book but both really good
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love this book! Just when you think that you know what is going on Grisham pulls you in another direction. I had stopped reading John Grisham because his books were so predictable but The Racketeer is different.  I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next.  READ THIS BOOK IT'S GREAT!
B008IYR2BA|4.0|He has a condition that the culture views as monstrous, and he strives to love and be loved at the same time.
0525958002|5.0|I absolutely feel in love reading this book, It took me back to an era that I will never forget and it almost seemed as if I was on this journey with John Taylor through it all. I wish there were more details in the book on certain situations he talked about but overall he did a great job in relaying what he wanted to say in the book. I would recommend this as a good read for anyone who loves biographies of famous people. It shows that they are just as human as anyone else who is not in their world.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|A nice combo of upbeat pop tunes and country style ballads.  Her best work to date, in my opinion.  She's only 22, and I expect her to get better for years to come.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This album is amazing. I love everything about it, except for the fact that it's missing three of the tracks that I originally thought were part of the album. I am a hardcore fan of old Hollywood and the only thing that's gotten remotely close to new music with the same feel is Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics. This, though. Oh man. It's perfection. I have a pretty eclectic ear and am a fan of many genres, but I have to say Lana is the ultimate.<br /><br />I stumbled onto Blue Jeans a while back and was immediately enchanted. Unfortunately for me, the only place I could really find any of her music was on Youtube. A while later, I discovered Born To Die on a mobile music site I use and listened to it for over a month straight. Literally. It was the only music I played - in the car, at work, even while I exercised. Couldn't get enough. And I still can't, only now I also have Paradise to obsess over. I love them both so much, I purchased the CD's. The CD's! I have them both on my phone and still bought the actual discs - which was kind of like transporting back in time to the year 2000 (last time I bought a real CD).<br /><br />I know Lana gets a lot of criticism (seriously not sure why that is) and I'm sure plenty of artists do - I've just never been a big enough fan of any one person to notice it. This album is transcendental. For real. I can't fathom how a human being with working ears would not enjoy every song on it. Do yourself a favor and at least listen to it once. You'll be glad you did!
B00021HBGS|5.0|Received this set as a hand me down and my 20month old son adores these \\"stickers\\" I'm assuming since it survived 1 child already that they are pretty good quality and will be long time favorites! Also my son likes them in and out of the tub!
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I was afraid to listen to this album only because I love Born To Die so much. If Paradise was going to be a let down, I didn't want to hear it. I held out for about 2 hours before I couldn't take not having heard it and wow. Just like with Born To Die, I have had this album on repeat since I first gave in and hit play.<br /><br />I don't know how she does it, but her music is so addictive. I literally can't stop playing it. Besides, I catch a new line or lyric every time I listen to the songs. She's a genius and has captured the old Hollywood feel perfectly. I don't care if she's not genuine, putting on an act, contrived - whatever critics are saying about her. She still sounds amazing and is trailblazing her way into this new genre of Hollywood pop, sadcore, whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />If you were a fan of Born To Die but haven't listened to this yet, just do it. You won't be disappointed. You might even find yourself playing it on a loop during every waking moment for the rest of your immediate future, as I have. In closing, buy the album! If you're afraid to commit, check out a couple of tracks on Youtube. Once you hear the sonic magic, I'm sure you'll have to own it for yourself. I can't recommend this enough.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I first saw this at the theater way back in 1999.  It was completely unlike anything we'd ever seen before, and completely, well, awesome.  Acting, writing, directing (I *heart* you, David Fincher) - all are spectacular.  Even after what must be my 100th-plus viewing, it's still AMAZING.  And, of course, the moment of revelation is unforgettable.<br /><br />The chaos and violence of this movie made headlines; the filmmaking made it immortal.<br /><br />I know this, because Tyler knows this.
085786078X|4.0|Really cute with the new kitten in it. The kitten provides the perfect foil. Double trouble and I didn't do it.
B004EJUMT2|4.0|This album rocks!  Musically, this album is great, clean instrument and vocal sounds, great vocal, rhythm and guitar work.  This is a great metal album from start to finish.  The reason I am giving four stars instead of five is the lyric content.  The lyrics are a strong Satan praise fest throughout..now I am not shy about \\"evil\\" lyrics, however, the lyrics are a bit over the top with the Satanic theme.  It almost doesn't fit with the unbelievable musicianship and song structure.  I'm a huge metal fan, and I can honestly say that these musicians do not need to rely on a Satanic theme to sell the records, which sadly leads me to believe that they actually are Satan worshipers.  I'm not here to debate religion or anything theological, just saying that lyrically this isn't my cup of tea.  The album is well worth the listen for the musicianship and melodies, just be warned about the lyric content.
B006H5120E|5.0|You can  take this review as gospel!!  I'll start by saying. BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL STUNNING,, SPECTACULAR, REALISM, IMMERSIVE, GRIPPING, And OMG!!!! As of recently I have been purchasing many 3d DVD's And this movie by far is the absolute best I've own or have ever seen in my life. I have 20  3D Blu ray movies, and with Titantic this movie has become the disk to showcase the 3D technology in my home entertainment system.<br /><br />As i mentioned above in this review i have been buying many 3D movies as of late, and just tonight i watched two movies and then laid in bed. As i was in laying there i started reading more reviews on Titanic 3D in blu ray, after reading a lot of good reviews i got up and popped this movie in. As i was opening my new movie case to Titanic 3D i grabbed the part two disk and played it, instantly i was Blown away!!! By the picture quality the vividness  and the immersion i was thrown into, absolutely blown away with what I saw.<br /><br />There has been some talk about how 2D to 3D conversation was not of good quality, but with this conversion it is (in total aspect of a converted movie) flawless.<br /><br />Ok not to keep you reading this for too long, ill just get to the point.  The acting and story line is grate, but I'm sure you want to know about the 3D quality of this movie. With this movie being in full screen you'll seriously feel as if you are actually in the movie with the actors, with this movie in a way so to speak it will take you back in time and place you on/in the Titanic.<br /><br />Every 3D movie on blu ray should be of this quality. After seeing a 3D movie this good everything else will be substandard.<br /><br />Im going to end this review with a few points i would like to stick with you. The scenes seems to be to scale are very realistic.<br /><br />When there are still camera shots in conversions it truly feels like you're in the room and taking part in the conversation.<br /><br />This movie is a true must have for any home with a 3D TV.  Buy this movie and you will believe what I have written is true, you will enter this movie.home with a 3D TV.  Buy this movie and you will believe what I have written is true, you will enter this movie.
0316223239|5.0|Imagine a tool shed converted into living space. A small room with a bed, closet, toilet, bath, kitchen, and no windows. Now imagine growing up in this space not knowing that anything existed outside of its walls. This is how Jack was raised. He was born in captivity. At the age of five his mother decided it was time for Jack to know the truth. There was an entire world beyond the walls of \\"room\\" and it was time for them to make their great escape and join the rest of the world.<br /><br />Room follows the heart wrenching story from captivity to freedom from the perspective of five-year-old Jack. Every thought, every feeling, every vision is that of a child's. Donoghue does an excellent job of never breaking character as the reader never sees or hears anything that Jack doesn't see or hear himself. At first, this writing style was bit tricky to get used to as we don't always think the way a five-year-old does, but lucky for us, Jack is extremely advanced for his age so the writing doesn't feel dumbed down to fit the style.<br /><br />Through Jack and his mother's escape the author shows the reader the drastic difference in recovery and adpatation between a child and an adult. Jack's mother strives to become who she once was before the incident while Jack doesn't understand why \\"room\\" was such a bad place or why he has to learn all these new things. Jack has trouble coping with what is real or fake, good or bad, and really doesn't seem to like all the open spaces. It's weird to think that he grew up without so many things that we take for granted such as fresh air, windows, other people, potato chips, cars, playgrounds, family, etc. He's never even been exposed to enough germs to give him the common cold! (Although I'm sure many of us wouldn't mind living without that little thing.)<br /><br />All-in-all, Donoghue really stepped out of the box with this novel and made me really think about how different a child is affected by a crime like this vs an adult that's beenthrough the same ordeal. It was definitely a different spin on captivity and makes me think very differently about all those zoo animals all of a sudden.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars<br />Recommended for: People who love crime stories or realistic fiction
B004RKXHZY|5.0|stephanie perkins i amazing omg i love this book so much huhuhu i finished it in one morning i couldn't put it down. Cricket Bell is the perfect guy. At first I was hesitant because i wasnt sure if it could live up to anna but it did ahhhh
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is one of the best of the &#34;superhero&#34; movies. LOTS of action, just enough humor and well developed characters and syory! If they can come out with another to natch, WOW!
1451695187|5.0|As a professional Medical Worker I found this book to be very credible and scientifically documented . NDE's are very real and so often unreported . Sharing an NDE is a lot like sharing a miracle,very real and very personal but nearly impossible to prove, especially to the skeptically frightened . Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this book just as it was released .
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Have owed this movie on DVD for years, just got it on Blu-Ray.  Great cast, story line, and action scenes.
0679746048|5.0|Before I bought this book I read reviews that warned that it was not like a narrative. It is not like a traditional fiction book, but that is because it is a nonfiction book. It is a sort of memoir of the author and the book's flow reflects that. It is not laid out in perfect storytelling order, but that actually allows it to feel more realistic and captivating at times.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read many of John Grisham's books and found this one just okay.  Wasn't his usual style of writing in that he jumped around a little and the ending was a little flat.  Still read all of it though and would tell anyone to judge for themselves.  I won't stop reading his work as I have read too many of his I do like.
0525478817|4.0|The book was great. After the author of Imperial Affliction was introduced, however, it just did not feel real anymore. The Fault In Our Stars was still amazing and thought provoking, but it became ultimately artificial.

B008AT71WI|5.0|I fell in love with this musical, since I saw it in Mexico city. I was 18 years old, so I was impressed by th dark ending. I always want that they make a movie, in a time when movie musicals where no more. So they did it, but I was so disappointed with the happy ending. So I read about the original ending since 1986... I was one of the few fortunate that bought the DVD with the original ending in black and white, the effects look so impresive even in black and white. what a shame they never use it. Thank you Frank Oz, thank you warner. You make me very happy, now I m organizing a reunion with the new  Little shop cast from Mexico to see this master piece!

B0041KVZ18|4.0|The Beatles 'White Album' 2012 reissue.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 180g vinyl with Apple labels<br />- Poster on uncoated paper with unedited Paul picture and lyrics on back in black text<br />- Four Beatles pictures on heavy stock (like original release)<br />- Band name is embossed (not printed) on cover<br />- Gatefold (like original)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No number is stamped on front like original<br />- Has modern copyright info printed on inside gatefold bottom<br />- Is not top loading like original UK release<br />- Has black inner sleeves but they have label holes in middle and clear plastic inner sleeve (original does not have plastic)<br /><br />It's these little details that I want faithfully duplicated. Apple, while possibly making a superior-sounding record, has dropped the ball on making a true collectable.<br /><br />[DW]
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really liked the book.  Almost as if I was there.  I bought one in Utah for my 20 year old grandson.  He couldn't put it down.
B007TMON8M|5.0|this game is a simple physics simulator the reminds me a lot of the wooden bridge project i did in high school physics.  playing this game however, lets you test different models over and over whereas in class we really only had one shot at building and then destroying our bridge so it was hard to gather enough data to really learn about how forces on a structure work.  this game is really fun and is educational without coming off as an educational game.<br /><br />it runs well on my Droid 4.  smooth and no crashes yet.<br /><br />good job Jundroo.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Do NOT get this app. Flash is already on the kindle, just needs to be turned on in settings. Also I had this app and kept getting annoying push notifications. I found out that those can be harmful to your device and steal personal data.

B003MC5N28|4.0|Good storyline, a bit slow starting, but storyline develops well. Looking forward to next book.  Hoping it continues to develop the characters.
B00505470O|5.0|[[ASIN:B0058U0EEO Within And Without]] is a fantastic album to put on for your Sunday afternoon - it's like a cool rush to the head, without those vocals that can often be polarizing (either you love or hate most vocals on Chill, House, or Trance music). When vocals do appear on the album, they are indeed 'washed out' so they blend in with the music and the words are mostly indiscernible. On the last track you'l hear them more but even then you'll need to pay attention to make anything out... and this is a good thing. Too often we pay attention to the words being sung, rather than the human voice as instrument on it's own, and a great balance is nailed just right on this album.<br /><br />I got this album last year shortly after it came out, and immediately loved it from start to finish. It's smooth enough to blend into background if you get involved in something (I listen to it at work every so often), or put it on and enjoy it.<br /><br />Select songs really stand out: Amor Fati (but I will say, the music video makes very little sense) and Eyes Be Closed. If you want to sample the best tracks, sample these two. The rest of the album does tend to be more washed out than these, but the whole thing is very listenable.<br /><br />If you want an album that exemplifies Chill music, you'll like this one.
1451638450|5.0|Finally, Lois has written a book for those of us who wanted to learn more about Ivan Vorpatril, one of her more amusing and interesting side characters. As the book opens, Ivan is on Komarr as the aide to an important admiral. In his mid-30's he's still the bachelor playboy he has always been but is perhaps just a bit tired of it all. One day he is approached by his sort-of friend and covert ImpSec operative Byerly with a simple request: Romance a beautiful woman. What could be easier for a guy like Ivan? But very quickly this simple request goes amusingly, and dangerously, sideways. Soon Ivan finds himself at the center of kidnapping plots and galactic politics as he must struggle to save both the fair damsel in distress and his career. At the same time his personal life is upended in ways he never expected.<br /><br />And through it all Ivan is revealed as a far more three-dimensional character than in previous books. No longer just Miles' foil, he is revealed as highly competent, clever, resourceful and able to think quickly under pressure. While I was at first just a little skeptical that an Ivan story would be able to carry an entire book I'm happy to report that my concerns were unfounded as Lois comes through once again for her readers.<br /><br />The book ends with a note by the author concerning the order in which the books should be read. This, coupled with the fact that her characters are now comfortably domesticated leads me to believe that she has wrapped up the Vorkosigan saga with this novel. If so, thank you Lois for a great ride and for leaving us these wonderful books to be reread and savored.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|You will not want to put it down!  Grisham is always good and this one is among his best. Oooo
B000CNESU8|5.0|If you ever wondered where CNN and Fox News got their playbook, here it is. Never has there been a more accurate prognostication about the future of television networks and network news than this 1976 satire of mass media, greed and folly.  Every evening at 5PM, 6PM, 10PM and 11PM in the US you will see everything in this outrageous satire streamed to you live and for real by your local stations and networks.<br /><br />The dialog is absolutely amazing with incredible deliveries by the cast. The rants by principal characters could be bronzed and displayed as individual works of art. Not only is the iconic Howard Beale's \\"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" delivered by Peter Finch, but there is an amazing delivery of Arthur Jensen's \\"You have meddled with the primal forces of nature... you must atone!\\" delivered by Ned Beatty not once, but twice! There is more sound-bite and quotable material in this one film than in any 20 of the usual mediocrity from Hollywood.<br /><br />You will hear little gems of vocabulary you see only in an unabridged dictionary, such as \\"adamantine,\\" \\"auspicable\\" and \\"immane\\" that give the characters and the story a satirical and ironic depth with a self-deceived intellectual veneer over the primal forces of greed-driven profiteering they so callously represent.<br /><br />There is so much in this film that was shocking in 1976 but now so true and taken for granted over 35 years later. Yet, this film still has teeth and bites hard with its incriminating satire about corporate greed and profiteering through mass media. We may think the pandering to the basest of human primal natures in this film is outrageous, yet we wallow in it every day inside corporate cultures and between corporations and the general public.<br /><br />Every actor is a shining gem in this collection of outrageous characters and is a credit to their craft and the direction and vision from Sidney Lumet and dialog from Paddy Chayefsky. No wonder too.Paddy Chayefsky is the only triple-Oscar-winning solo screenwriter and 14 of Sidney Lumet's films were nominated for Academy awards. Network alone was nominated for 10 and awarded four. Paddy Chayefsky is no stranger to satire having written Hospital, another Academy award winning screenplay. Sidney Lumet is no stranger to outrageous characters having directed such greats as 12 Angry Men, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, The Verdict and Prince Of The City.<br /><br />This film deserves every accolade it has received twice over.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day, by Navy Seal Matt Bissonette (rating under a pseudonym, Mark Owen) is a good first hand account of one Seal members rise through the Special Ops ranks.  There are Seal teams within the Seals where only the best of the best get through, and he is one of them.  Narrative is descriptive of facts while being vague on details of specific strategy and techniques so as not to provide enemy forces with tactical information.<br />On a side note,this book was not vetted by the Department of Defense so there is a question about whether charges will be brought against this hero warrior.  It was thru leaks and information gleaned from the narrative that the author's name was divulged to the press, which is unfortunate as it now puts his life, the life of his family, and his comrades in arms at greater risk.
B007N8RULO|5.0|It was a good movie and differant from the others.A differant villian from the other movies kinda put a strange twist to it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Read this book twice and loved it more the second time.  A beautiful story of reality and overcoming life's obstacles in a very positive way and willing to share with the world.
B005LAII94|1.0|I'd read the book. I've seen many of Oliver Stone's movies. So it's fair to say I approached this movie with some reservations. Unfortunately, it lived down to my every expectation.<br /><br />First the book. The first Winslow book I read was [[ASIN:1400096936 The Power of the Dog]], which I thought was simply terrific. Based on that book, I've read several of his other works, and in my opinion he hasn't matched the level of that achievement in anything else of his that I've read. I thought [[ASIN:B003L785PG Savages]] was simply okay. A bit too much of the Winslow-patented surfer vibe, and the over-the-hill \\"dude\\" stuff for my taste. But when I read that it was being made into a movie, I thought it had some good potential, with the visuals and twisted plot and all.<br /><br />Enter Oliver Stone, a guy with about the most uneven record in Hollywood. When he's hitting his marks, he can make a pretty good flick; \\"Platoon\\", \\"Wall Street\\". When he's off, his stuff is ridiculous; \\"JFK\\" and \\"W.\\" come immediately to mind.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this is a complete misfire.<br /><br />Stone seems to have taken every opportunity to explore the weaker elements of the book while completely ignoring or perverting its strengths. Some of the performances are completely over the top. I don't know if he was trying for some kind of sarcastic humor approach, or failed satire, or what.<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury (and why I detracted one star), he gave us the ending that was in the novel.... and then \\"Oooops! Only kidding!!\\"... he throws in a SECOND ending, too, that made absolutely no sense at all, and destroyed what little he'd managed to achieve to that point!<br /><br />I mean, what the hell was that all about???<br /><br />I'd have thrown something hard at the screen, but I was watching it on my own plasma big sreen, so that would have been a bit of an overindulgence.<br /><br />\\"Savages\\"? Do not bother.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|It was a pretty good book but the formatting was a bit confusing it was a documrntiry and a story in one but I would recommend if you able to understand it.Then again I am only 13 so I could just be me
141659521X|4.0|Sometimes, Vince Flynn seems to be prescient in the topics he covers in his novels, which seem to come out very shortly after real-world events of a similar nature.<br /><br />In Pakistan, a CIA safe house is raided and one of the Agency's tactical geniuses is kidnapped, evidently by jihadist fanatics. Benghazi, anyone?<br /><br />This is a potential disaster for the Agency, as the kidnapped agent has all kinds of dangerous secrets locked in his mind, and the revelation of that knowledge would be a crippling blow to its operations throughout the region, putting undercover agents and clandestine operations at fatal risk.<br /><br />CIA Director Irene Kennedy dispatches Mitch Rapp to the site to determine what's happened, and to try to recover the kidnapped agent. But once there, he finds that things aren't as they seem on the surface.<br /><br />With a tight plot and suspenseful pacing, this story's full of the duplicity and political wrangling so typical of the region, with implications and ramifications that reach all the way into the halls of power in Washington.<br /><br />As usual, this Rapp book isn't a simple \\"thriller\\"; it's so much more. Classic espionage with liberal doses of political intrigue, both in Pakistan and our nation's capital. This is one the best Rapp books in a long time. Highly recommended.<br /><br />4 ½ stars.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Season 1 is the best.  This show was so good.  I love the characters and I'm from western Washington so the local is very familiar

B005HT400A|4.0|It was great to see a classic redone in HD. While immediately a critic's choice when released, it took a while for the general public to catch up with the unnerving and stark realism of the film. It's nice to finally own one of my top 10 movies in Blu-ray.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Cliff hanger ending literally!  I enjoyed the book.  Lots of changes in the relationships of the heroes.  I am looking forward to the next book.
0385535147|2.0|In my view, there is no doubt that John Grisham is<br />one of the best. The Racketeer was a disspointment.<br />Having read some of his great works: Pelican Brief,<br />Runaway Jury, The Confession, King of Torts and others,<br />this cannot be included.<br /><br />Judge Fawcett's murder and the Rule 35 release of the<br />wrongly convicted is all great basic outline material.<br />The story however, comes well short of his great abilities.<br />By the end of the book-leaving Antigua; Vanessa, and Quinn, and<br />even Max didn't captivate me. The characters never<br />did bloom to the real thing as Grisham is known for in prior<br />bestsellers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love it! Could have a few better updates, but it,s great! But I would regimens the computer version, you can do a lot more things.
B0091LF2QQ|3.0|This album seems to have a few memorable tunes, but the excitement and charm of the first Mika album, &#34;Life in Cartoon Motion&#34; is in now way matched.  I find this album to be about like the previous &#34;The Boy who Knew Too Much&#34; in listenability.  It is calmed down some with the vocals, leading to a subdued level of energy... and for me that is why the first remains the most played at my house.
B001V7YJMG|3.0|I'm not big on vampires in general. Movies, books, shows...and none of it has to do with the recent Twilight explosion. They've just never interested me even the slightest. I'll still give a book or movie featuring them a chance if it sounds good enough, or at least sounds unique. The plot summary for Let the Right One In sounded pretty good when I first read it a few years ago. When I watched the movie then, I thought it was ok. Watching it again now, I feel the same. I honestly can't see what all the hype is about with it. Let the Right One In has some good qualities, but moves way too slowly and doesn't shed much light on a couple of plot points, while choosing to go off track with an underwhelming sub-plot. You could take at least 20 minutes out of this movie and have something much better. Apparently, the book was more solid and had answers for all the questions. It's too bad they didn't stick closer to it.<br /><br />Set in the 1980s, Let the Right One In is the story of a young boy, Oskar, who is a loner if there ever was one. He's always picked on at school by a couple of other boys, doesn't have any friends to play with, and merely practices telling off the bullies while stabbing a tree with a small knife. His parents are divorced too, and he lives with his mom in an apartment. One day, new neighbors move in next door- an older man named Hakan and a young girl named Eli. We quickly learn that Eli is a vampire, and Hakan more or less works for her, killing people and draining their blood into containers. Oskar doesn't catch on to this, seeing her as just another kid and, more importantly, his friend. Eli gives him courage, little by little, and he becomes more confident. He just might do something about those bullies at this rate. At the same time, Hakan screws up big time during a blood run, when he forgets to take the blood from the scene of the crime. Eli doesn't take this very lightly. Meanwhile, a small group of people in a cafe begin to make somethingof the murders, and one guy goes nuts when a friend of his becomes a victim.<br /><br />Oskar and Eli's relationship is very believable [for what it is] and cute. Seeing this quiet little loner kid asking her questions about herself and teaching her things like what a Rubik's Cube make up some of the best scenes in the movie. The poor kid doesn't have much going on in his life and she's just what he needed. Kare Hedebrant does a fantastic job as Oskar and whenever he was having moments of joy, I couldn't help but smile a little. I was equally impressed by most of the special effects in the movie looking as good as they do. There's very little CG work here and any time Eli would climb a wall or go into turbo mode, it looked great. When someone was cut or bitten, blood didn't blast all over the place either. When it came down to it, I was more interested in the characters themselves than I was with what was going on with the movie. And for what it's worth, I'm glad they didn't overdo it with the vampire bits, though you may need to know a little bit about them before watching this. Just look at the name of the movie- I didn't know anything about that until just a few months ago!<br /><br />My problem is that Let the Right One In drags on for far too long. Numerous scenes go on for longer than they should thanks to long periods of silence and nothing happening. Look, I'm not the kind of guy that drinks Monster and needs constant action. Heck, one of my favorite movies is There Will Be Blood. But I was getting a little jittery while watching this one, almost to the point of fast forwarding through a few parts. Instead of having no one say anything, why not give us a little more dialogue to flesh out the characters? I understand that keeping things to a minimum might make what the characters say seem a little more important, but they don't say a whole lot as it is. That's part of why I wanted to learn more about Eli. The other big problem I have is the sub-plot with thecafe people. Lacke is the main guy of the group, and his friend Jocke get killed by Eli when she needs blood. We never learn anything about Jocke, and every now and then the movie switches over to Lacke going crazy over his death for a couple of minutes. Later on, something happens to another person in the group (involving cats and stairs), and it's so silly that you can't help but laugh out loud when you see it play out. But...it's supposed to be a serious scene and contribute to Lacke's sadness. To me, this whole portion of the movie is so tacked on and barely has any payoff. I never cared about Lacke or his friends. They're tacked on. I hear this section is much bigger in the book. Maybe I'll read it and see how much better everything with it is.<br /><br />There's more I could talk about but I don't want to go too far into the details. Let the Right One In is worth watching, though I can't recommend more than a rental. I'll probably check out the book sometime, or go with the remake that came out not too long ago to see how they handled things there. As much as people love to bash remakes, some good ones have been made, and this is one of those times where I feel that if done right, a remake could definitely be better than the original.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|This title is my third one produced by Kino Video. The General and Metropolis are the others, both well executed products. Their restoration work is a perfect balance of rescuing the damaged film and still providing a quite viewable picture without losing the look and feel of a ninety year old production. Options and extras round out the enjoyment of this groundbreaking film.<br />ONE star for Amazon for not distinguishing which studio/distributor the DVD is from. There's even VHS reviews here from ten years ago!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoy this book not for the sex in it but for wanting to learn why this man is the way he is. What happened to him to make him so non feeling, you just can feel the little boy in there somewhere.I am now on book 2.

B008458O3S|5.0|This a one of the top games I've ever found for my android tablet.  Lots of levels and each more challenging than the previous. Controls work very well and I never had problems playing. I appreciated that I was allowed to play each puzzle as often as I liked without some point system interfering - no time limits. This is a logic game that exercises the brain instead of my reflexes, just what I enjoy.
B007JUWM64|2.0|Being able to watch movies from home is great; I did find this movie a bit boring, so maybe too many musketeer movies have been made?  Thanks for having it available for me.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was very violent, lots of death.  Good but not the best in the series.  But I highly recommend reading it because it does a good job of closing up the series.
0765316994|5.0|Redshirts starts off as a hilarious parody of the Trek we all know and love, then evolves into a brain-bending narrative all its own. Scalzi's strength has always been his concepts, rather than his prose, and that remains true here, but anyone interested in a compelling plot with a strong sense of humor will find much to enjoy. And much as they exist to be mocked, even the top-billed \\"stars\\" of the story become likeable along the way.<br /><br />The Codex might have been better if it had been integrated into the main book, rather than tacked on at the end. Its first story felt a little self-indulgent and the second rather pointless. But the third story was quite sweet and a nice way to end. Read it for completion's sake, but the Codex might just be the publisher's way of padding out the book's length.<br /><br />Overall, a truly funny and interesting novel, especially for those of us who love Star Trek but can recognize some of its silliness.
B009329ZF2|2.0|Could have been better - there was really no continuity or action till the end. The storyline was uninspiring until they brought the Vets in.
0316228532|1.0|Very slow read was expecting more from the author.  I just old not get into this one don't even know that I will finish it
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is the second book in a series of 18. It is about an ex-military man who is wondering around the country. He has a lot of military skills and acts sort of like a man on a mission but not of his own making. In this book Jack gets roped into a group of survivalists and narrowly escapes with his life. Lots of action. Overall a pretty good read.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Interesting story line.  Martel creates a narrative with his main character, Pi that is convincing and holds reader's attention.  Half way through the novel I had to remind myself the book is a work of fiction.  I enjoyed the Life of Pi and would recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|at first i was like what this is a wast of money butt when you get into the game it got better and better you can build castle's. villages. trapps. and a whole bunch of other stuff the worlds are amazing
B0086700CM|4.0|well when you first get it you're addicted, but after a while it gets boring.you can get this app its fun but frustrating.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great deal for all you get. Don't even have a 3D capable TV,  but this set was a better price.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|lame just a big copy off of minecraft this may have more stuff but minecraft is wayyy better! i hate this game soooooo much

B0098460O4|2.0|The Charlotte and Jonathon CD  \\"Together\\" will surely attract a ton of favorable reviews. Reviews I have read are complimentary but display amazing ignorance in referring to<br />Jonathon as a tenor and make me question the value of their accreditations. Mr Antoine was gifted by God with a magnificent instrument that we are allowed to enjoy about once a century----but he is a bass/baritone !  Where were the editors ?<br /><br />Observation from Chuckeroo.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app so much! there are so many dragons to get and you can breed every dragon with the right combo. the decorations for your island are cool and the dragons look great. it's very easy to earn both types of currency in the game and you don't have to spend a dime. there's lots to do other then breeding dragons including racing them and entering them in contests to earn gems. in every way this game is way better then dragon story. unlike dragon story, all updates are available to all users despite what device your using. you won't be disappointed with this app. it's my absolute favorite.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|its super fun but super easy.  if they made it a little more challenging like the first angry birds it would be SUPER FUN.  not sayian just sayian
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game is a rip off of minecraft and should be sued. its not long enough and may be better than pocket addition minecraft but not real version!
1609611543|5.0|i havent finished the book, but what i read i found it interesting and very helpful to get on<br />track in eating
0812993292|5.0|.with lots of food for thought.  Good writing as well.  Don't think requiring a certain number of words for this review is a very good idea, though.
030758836X|5.0|Just so you know, the book starts out slow.... and then there is a moment in the book where you state aloud \\"holy moly!\\" This book is good. My book club is reading it right now, and everyone is telling me they are looking forward to talking about the book!
B008458O3S|5.0|Very well-designed game - everything is done right: the level design; the short but complete tutorials; the level difficulty progression; intuitive controls; unlimited undo; unobtrusive request for review only after you've completed all levels.  If this was truly done by one guy in his spare time, I hope he makes enough off this one to do more.<br /><br />As for the game itself, it consists of drawing track on a grid of squares to route colored engines from their source to their destination.  As you progress, you can merge engines to change color (e.g. blue and yellow make green) or split engines into two.  Puzzles are rated from two to eleven stars, and the later ones are difficult enough (tricky to move those trains around in the space available without tracks running into each other) that you feel a real burst of satisfaction on reaching the solution.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes puzzle games.
B00992CF6W|2.0|this thing doesn't download I have the PC version and ROCKS! pocket edition doesn't download ive been told that PE isn't the best. I have played it on my friends ipod
B0015AARJI|5.0|I really recommand it to try and buy it, it's cheaper original if we compare it with other PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book covers romance and death. It is totally worth reading!!! This was my second time reading the Hunger Games!!! Now going to read the rest of the trilogy again!!!!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|What can I say - it's a cable, it works as advertised. What more can I say. Three more words required - satisfied
B00973DDN2|1.0|Not a huge fan but appreciated all the earlier efforts.  This album just never had that spark that made The Killers special.  Very disappointed.
B007EC27QM|1.0|I found the Calculator Pro for Kindle more useful. This one does not have the functions I regularly utilize. I do not recommend this app.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Excellent album.  Agree with others if you like Mumford and sons, plus beautiful south you should love this album.  Will be recommending this to friends
B007IXWL2C|2.0|These books would be good if there wasn't so much raunchy sex.  It made the books sickening at times.  Will never read one of her books again.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I really like the 50 shades of gray like story line it keeps it interesting and fun.
B00009NQQO|5.0|We surprised our 2yr old daughter with this basketball set for the tub. She absolutely loves it & does not want bath time to end!
1432794426|5.0|I am very grateful to Mrs.Karen Moriarty,  because she wrote such a wonderful book with such unconditional love and dedication.  Her words reflect great love for Michael Jackson and I was often moved to tears. I was also surprised that she had succeeded to talk directly to so many Michael's friends, colleagues, employees  and relatives. With that she collected so many interesting details from his private and professional life. The book is interesting from the beginning to the end. Congratulations!<br />Zvezdana  -  Slovenia
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really like this trilogy.  I'm a 50 shades fan, and this series is helping me cope with the end of that one.  I can't wait for the last book to come out.  Looking forward to seeing how this series ends.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun and easy to play. do not like how the higher level games require do many points to unlock. you must repeat several games to earn rnough points to advance
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Operates fine, it is just like the version on my iPhone.  Easy to use and responsive.  Only think I dont like is that it is hard to untag yourself in pictures from this version.  Usually have to logon on my laptop to untag myself in photos.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Buying a used DVD series made me a little nervous, but this was one of my best ideas. The DVDs all work great, very little scratches, and have no problems playing. I made sure to buy from a company who would refund or exchange my purchase within two weeks to a month, just in case.<br /><br />If you're concerned about whether you will like the Spartacus series, don't be. The acting is superb and the story will have you hanging on the edge of your seat in suspense. If you love the Dexter series, Spartacus will not disappoint you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was surprised! I read Wool 1 and immediately came back to see what else was available from Hugh Howey. Bought Wool Omnibus and was caught up in a great read. If you are a fan of true science fiction Wool Ominbus is worth the price.
0446614459|2.0|I have been reading through a few mystery/thriller books over the last year or two.  In that time I worked my way through the entire series of Lee Child novels, all of the Tim Dorsey books, and most of John D MacDonald.  So, admittedly, I am a bit spoiled on good characters and good mystery writing.  So I have been looking to spread my wings a little bit and find some other writers to work through.  And, I have seen David Baldacci's name in a lot of places.<br /><br />Now, the most prominent way I have seen him mentioned is when Lee Child said in an interview that he didn't really care for his writing.  I thought that was maybe the kind of talk that comes from competitors not wanting to give an inch to another competitor.  But I think I saw all of what Child was talking about in this book.<br /><br />The dialogue was kind of terrible.<br /><br />The action and plot was kind of seriously outrageous.<br /><br />So much of the plot and pertinent information was hidden from the reader so that it could be sprung on us at the end.<br /><br />All in all, not a really great introduction.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|The movie begins with a narration: &quot;Earth-That-Was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many. We found a new solar system, dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human life. To be new Earths. The central planets formed The Alliance, ruled by an interplanetary parliament. The Alliance was a beacon of civilization. The savage outer planets were not so enlightened, and refused Alliance control. [At about here, you realize that this is sounding too much like a political ad, or maybe indoctrination. Then, sure enough, you see the speaker, a teacher standing in front of her young charges. She continues:]<br />The war was devastating. But the Alliance's victory over the Independents insured a safer universe. And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of true civilization.&quot;<br /><br />One of the students is the young River Tam. She tells the teacher why the Independents would have rebelled: &quot;We meddle ... People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do. What to think. Don't run. Don't walk. We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right.&quot;<br /><br />It's not just the plot and acting of &quot;Serenity&quot; that are excellent. It is the way the story is told; how it unfolds. First the disembodied voice, which turns into the teacher, which turns into a memory of the now 17 year-old River the subject of terrible experiments, which turns into an archive video being watched by The Operative. And this all happens before the opening credits!<br /><br />The archive video is of Simon Tam rescuing his little sister, River, from the Alliance laboratory. And now the two are on the run from the Alliance, aboard the Serenity, a Firefly class transport ship. Captain Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds was a Brown Coat, an Independent squashed by the Alliance. Now he's trying to make a living smuggling and salvaging, on the ship he named after the Plains of Serenity, the last great battle of the failed war of independence.<br /><br />It is a hard way to make a living. As Mal tells the unhappy Simon, &quot;I put this crew together with the promise of work, which the Alliance makes harder every year. Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to ship about at all. This job goes south, there well may not be another. So here's us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you.&quot;<br /><br />The themes of &quot;Serenity&quot; are universal, sometimes troubling. The dialogue is snappy. The humor is great and frequently campy. Our first view of the ship Serenity shows it in trouble. The pilot says, &quot;This landing is going to get pretty interesting.&quot;<br />The Captain looks at him: &quot;Define interesting.&quot;<br />Pilot: &quot;Oh God Oh God, we're all going to die?&quot;<br /><br />I saw &quot;Serenity&quot; in the movie theater before we even knew of the prequel TV series, &quot;Firefly&quot;. Now, we have both for home viewing, and I strongly recommend watching the TV series first, if possible. The movie does stand alone and gives you sufficient background. But the experience will be richer if you have seen the TV series first.<br />DVD:  [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly: The Complete Series]]<br />Blu-ray:  [[ASIN:B001EN71CW Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />BONUS EXTRAS on the [[ASIN:B004ZJZPXO Serenity [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy]]]:<br />To access the digital copy of the movie, you need to download from a Universal Studios site, using the activation code included.

Commentary by writer/director Joss Whedon (DVD) I enjoyed re-watching the movie with Whedon's commentary. Joss talks about needing a villain. &quot;Somebody who would believe so strongly in what he was doing, that he would do anything. The exact opposite, of course, of the hero. In casting Chiwetel Ejidfor, we found the perfect person because he brings such depth and soulfulness and regret to everything he does.&quot;<br />Whedon says that he likes to cast comedians in drama roles. Comedy, he says, &quot;is the hard one.&quot; If the actor can do comedy, then they can do drama.<br />7.  Deleted Scenes (17 minutes) Interesting - one deleted scene showed the Operative researching Mal. He finds out that the Battle of Serenity had a 68% casualty rate for the Independents. Soldiers like Mal kept fighting for 2 weeks after the generals surrendered.<br />8.  Outtakes (6 minutes)<br />9.  &quot;Future History: The Story of Earth That Was&quot; (10 minutes) Joss Whedon tells how he came up with this version of the future, which is supposed to be 500 years from now. For example, there are two universal languages used, English and Chinese. In Joss's imagined future, these two superpowers merged when Earth set out to colonize.<br />It's also interesting how he &quot;chose&quot; his hero: &quot;I just wanted to tell a story about people who are living in space, but not living in grandeur. And not living in great portent, but were more the fringe people. People that the Enterprise would have blown right past and never noticed.&quot;<br />And the hero's background: &quot;There's very little American fiction about the people who won the [Civil] war, about the North. The people we all like to be identified with, we're all interested in, is the South, because we love losers.&quot;<br />10.  &quot;What's in a Firefly&quot; (10 minutes) Fascinating look at how they worked scenes, such as the mule skip chase scene after the beginning bank robbery. Both CG and visual effects people explain how it was done.<br />11. &quot;Re-lighting the Firefly&quot; (25 minutes, from 2005) The story of how Joss Whedon and others pulled together a film to tell the story that was left unfinished in the prematurely cancelled TV series. Commentators include Whedon and most of the &quot;Firefly&quot; cast. The most memorable moment was the San Diego ComicCon, after the show's cancellation and before the movie was finished. On the last half of the last day of the convention, 5,000 people showed up to see Josh and the cast.<br />12. Joss Whedon Introdution (6 minutes) This is Whedon's introduction to a draft of the movie (not the final cut).<br /><br />Excellent, excellent film. The perfect example of the Space Cowboy movie!<br /><br />Happy Readermembers watching and commenting on the movie.<br />2.  Additional picture-in-picture (U-Control on Blu-Ray).

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Though some parts may not be completely  historically accurate, this movie was great at relating the life of Pope John Paul II before his papacy. It was a very entertaining movie and exceeded all my expectations. At first thought, most will think it would be boring, but it surprises you with a great story and fantastic film!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think that this is the best book of the trilogy, not only because it turns in to the fairy tale, but because it is more relate-able to life!!! 5 stars, RockAwesome-- I liked the supplemental material that was included as well.
0743482832|5.0|Guide for the Perplexed time (since Amazon's listing of Formats seems designed to generate confusion):<br /><br />This is a review of the Mass-Market Paperback edition of \\"The Tempest\\" under the label of \\"Folger Shakespeare Library,\\" published by Washington Square Press, edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine. It was first issued under the present label, with the yellow-and-mottled cover depicted on the page, in 2004. With its rich set of aides to the reader, it is a good introductory text, and contains much that will be useful to the more advanced student (although not intended to rival, say, the Arden and Norton Critical editions), and at this writing it is still attractively priced. It is part of a series of similar editions covering the complete canon of the plays.<br /><br />The OTHER formats (paperback, Kindle, Audio) currently listed by Amazon are of completely different editions of the same text, without the facing-page notes, period illustrations, and other features of the Folger/WSP editions; some of them without even line-numbers, to judge from previous reviews.<br /><br />Calling the newest version of the series just \\"Folger Shakespeare Library\\" somewhat confuses matters, since that is also the name of the actual sponsoring institution in Washington, D.C., which houses a major collection of Shakespeare editions, and related and period works of all kinds. Earlier printings of this text and notes, etc. (1994 and following) were under the label of \\"The New Folger Library Shakespeare,\\" and differed only in having a pictorial cover by Kinuko Y. Croft. This edition is listed on Amazon, too, but its reviews are lumped together with those of numerous other editions. In addition, Amazon also lists a hardcover edition as being edited by Mowat and Werstine (not seen).<br /><br />In any format, the Mowat and Werstine edition is also to be distinguished from its predecessor in \\"The Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare\\" series, edited by Louis B. Wright and Virginia A, LaMar (1961; also from Washington Square Press, and possibly also under its Pocket imprint), with the same basic facing-page design, but different notes and illustrations, and without the concluding essay and annotated bibliography (\\"Further Reading.) Copies appeared in both an older, smaller, mass-market format, and in the current, slightly larger one. In this instance, the texts are not drastically different; editorial practices and standards have changed, but the text, not published before the First Folio, is relatively clear and unproblematic.<br /><br />Those interested in a text edition of the play with notes restricted to the vocabulary, and without introductions on Shakespeare's stage and use of language, may want to take a look at Burton Raffel's \\"Annotated\\" edition, either in its paperback format, with the notes at the foot of the page, or its Kindle edition, with the notes hyper-linked to the text. The latter works well, but constant switching back and forth can produce a discontinuous reading of the play.<br /><br />To turn to the text being edited: \\"The Tempest\\" was probably the last play written entirely by William Shakespeare, sometime in 1610-1611. It was performed at court during the celebrations for the betrothal and marriage of King James I's daughter Elizabeth to Frederick, Prince of the Rhine Palatinate, and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, an event momentous in English literature for the sheer quantity and, frequently enough, the quality of verse it inspired. Whether it was written FOR the occasion is debatable; topical references seem instead to center on then-recent colonization efforts in the New World (Jamestown, and, accidentally, Bermuda); and the locales are all Mediterranean instead of Central European.<br /><br />Of course, given Shakespeare's \\"Sea Coast of Bohemia\\" (i.e., roughly, the modern Czech Republic) in another play, the argument from geography is not the firmest in the world. And, despite repeated arguments that the play is about European conquests and colonies in the New World, the repeated allusions seem to me more topical than thematic.<br /><br />The compactly-told story is set on a single island, during part of a single day, and is the only Shakespeare play since \\"Comedy of the Errors,\\" at the very beginning of his career, to observe so strictly the \\"Classical Unities\\" of time and space. (Although \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream came close.) Shakespeare could have spread the story over fifteen or so years, and three or four distant places, as in other plays, but in this case chose not to do so. This requires some exposition of the \\"back story,\\" which is handled well, as one would expect from Shakespeare at the height of his creative powers.<br /><br />Of course, there is a school of thought (or several) which insists on seeing in the tempest-raising magician Prospero an image of a tired Shakespeare on the verge of retiring from the theater. I admit that the notion is tempting, but Prospero himself, a testy old man, seems a poor image of Shakespeare, who, on the basis of the scanty evidence, seems to have been regarded as even-tempered and well-mannered (at least compared to most other theater-folk, or arrogant aristocrats).<br /><br />Then too, Prospero's insistence on stage-managing the events of the play is not a new idea in Shakespeare's work - compare the behind-the-scenes efforts of the incognito Duke in \\"Measure for Measure,\\" and of Oberon in \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\"<br /><br />For those not already familiar with the play, it is the only one of Shakespeare plays without a recognizable source for the main plot, although there is documentation for many details in the voyage literature of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, especially the earlier years of the Virginia colony. A few hints may have come from histories of Italy, but the names don't match up with any specific events. Most of the other suggested parallels to the plot are too general to tie directly to the play, although they may be helpful in understanding it.<br /><br />The grumpy magician, his beautiful daughter, the handsome young hero, and the magician's attendant creatures (of varying appearances, and moral and intellectual characteristics), are commonplaces of traditional fairytales and medieval and renaissance romances. (Not to mention a lot of modern genre fantasy, and older or popularized science fiction.) So, too, are wicked brothers and scheming courtiers.<br /><br />In other hands, these elements could have made a rambling crowd-pleaser like the then-popular \\"Mucedorus.\\" Shakespeare, who was at home with plots spread widely through time and space, here makes them the subject of a tightly constructed play. As has long been noted, \\"The Tempest\\" is one of the few Shakespeare plays to observe the so-called \\"classical unities\\" of (elapsed) time and a single place, in this case, a few hours nearby and on an enchanted island. In this is its unlike most other Elizabethan and Jacobean \\"romance\\" plays, very much including his own earlier ventures, such as \\"Twelfth Night\\" and \\"A Winter's Tale.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is one of my personal favorites in the Shakespeare canon. I'm not alone. It has inspired a long series of pastiches, retellings, parodies and satires, adaptations, operatic adaptations, and just plain productions. (My personal pick -- a purely sentimental one -- is \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" the 1956 movie starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, all upstaged by Robbie the Robot, in a double role emulating both the helpful spirit Ariel and the bumbling Caliban; and with an entirely different backstory.)he New World, the repeated allusions seem to me more topical than thematic.    The compactly-told story is set on a single island, during part of a single day, and is the only Shakespeare play since \\"Comedy of the Errors,\\" at the very beginning of his career, to observe so strictly the \\"Classical Unities\\" of time and space. (Although \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream came close.)

The grumpy magician, his beautiful daughter, the handsome young hero, and the magician's attendant creatures (of varying appearances, and moral and intellectual characteristics), are commonplaces of traditional fairytales and medieval and renaissance romances. (Not to mention a lot of modern genre fantasy, and older or popularized science fiction.) So, too, are wicked brothers and scheming courtiers.    In other hands, these elements could have made a rambling crowd-pleaser like the then-popular \\"Mucedorus.\\" Shakespeare, who was at home with plots spread widely through time and space, here makes them the subject of a tightly constructed play. As has long been noted, \\"The Tempest\\" is one of the few Shakespeare plays to observe the so-called \\"classical unities\\" of (elapsed) time and a single place, in this case, a few hours nearby and on an enchanted island. In this is its unlike most other Elizabethan and Jacobean \\"romance\\" plays, very much including his own earlier ventures, such as \\"Twelfth Night\\" and \\"A Winter's Tale.\\"    \\"The Tempest\\" is one of my personal favorites in the Shakespeare canon. I'm not alone. It has inspired a long series of pastiches, retellings, parodies and satires, adaptations, operatic adaptations, and just plain productions. (My personal pick -- a purely sentimental one -- is \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" the 1956 movie starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, all upstaged by Robbie the Robot, in a double role emulating both the helpful spirit Ariel and the bumbling Caliban; and with an entirely different backstory.)

B001EBV0NU|5.0|A silly movie, but with a great cast that makes it very funny. This was a well done movie with a crazy plot, but it kept you interested.
0446580848|2.0|I have liked a lot of Demille.  Charm School, for example, was a great book.  But The Panther was so tedious, so long, it makes one thing DeMille gets paid by the word.  There are long strectches of \\"plot\\" where nothing happens.  There are long descriptions that simply do not matter.  Who cares what the inside of the plane looked like if nothing is going to happen in the plane?  There are the grms of a good book here.  Corey, the lead character, is clever and i did laugh at loud at parts.  there good guys are good.  the bad guys are bad.  No shades of gray justify evil.  But the fact that Demille has a great moral compass does not excuse a book which is at least 300 pages too long.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|An excellent piece of work with Leslie Neilson and a great choice of cast members. newer sci fi is more advanced in the making, but for it's time this was done right on.

B000SEGQNS|4.0|I read this via Kindle on business flights.  A quick read with good advice and guidance.  The author definitely knows his stuff and does a good job of communicating the information in a succint manner.  My only minor complaint is that the website samples are very dated and it would be nice to see those updated.  I would also be interested to hear this author's opinion of more recent websites as many of them already have adopted some of his initial guidelines.  So I would be curious to see what he would do now with them.

0307592731|5.0|This book was a pleasure to read. Strayed seamlessly weaves together the story of her past with at of hiking the rigorous and at times unforgiving Pacific Crest Trail.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As a young adult, I loved Greek & Roman mythology. As an adult, I thoroughly enjoy the books by Rick Riordan. He puts a unique spin on the stories I grew up with, helping me remember why I loved them originally, and looking forward to seeing what happens to these new heroes next.
0446580848|1.0|I tried to read most of the negative reviews, but unless I missed it, I saw no comment about the thorough going anti-Arab/Muslim gratuitous bigotry throughout this book.  I am neither an Arab nor a Muslim, but I found DeMille's attacks far beyond any legitimate criticism of terrorism and one of the worst anti-Arab/Muslim diatribes I have seen.  I wonder how other ethnic groups would take it-- African-Americans, Latinos, Jews or what have you -- if they had been written about with such a broad negative brush?  Thoroughly disgusting!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed the book - it was the best of the three.  Readers need to read all three books. Good read.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I admit to owning dozens and dozens of \\"Christmas\\" CDs, but since I purchased \\"If On a Winter's Night\\" in 2009 when it was released, it's displaced everything else.  Obviously, it's music that won't appeal to everyone but if, like me, you like some dark woods and sorrow with your firelight and wassail, this music will be close to your heart.  Beautiful.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was well written & better than the first although you need to read all three.  Well written book.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Very verbose doesn't seem to be too coherent .  Just for the life of me cannot get into this book<br />Boring
B0077EBWVI|2.0|You have to wonder why they bothered to repeat the original movie in almost exactly the same way. New faces, same story. with only slight variations from the original. I'm thinking they probably lost a lot of money on this movie.<br />Being a guy, I'll grant that the chick was way hotter than Lori Singer was. Not being a girl, I can't speak to what women think about this guy as opposed to Kevin Bacon.<br />The one aspect of this movie that I really liked was that these people can actually dance. TO THE MUSIC.<br />We see these BS shows like Dancing with the Stars, with has-been TV personalities of yesteryear trying to ballroom dance. Does anyone else not notice that ballroom dancing is more of an exhibition than a dance? These people do not dance to the music, they just perform a practiced exercise to some background music.<br />Real dancing, solo or partnered, should move to the particular song being played. Just as no two songs are the same, so no two dances should be.<br />Dirty Dancing was a corney movie but it did show the world what real partnered dancing should be. When Pat and Jen danced they at least danced TO the music. Bodies moving to the beat and rythm of the song. Hips moving to the timing of the drum.

0345457692|3.0|I would have given this book a 5 star rating but for the author's regular use of made up words and concepts that he never explains. While I enjoy imagining what an author is talking about I don't like being left in mystery over and over. What a shame! Mr. Morgan has the makings of a great writer, he is technically good, he is original and can create a world as raw and haunting as the one we saw in Blade Runner. As soon as he realizes that he needs to actually communicate with his readers so that his concepts can be understood, it wouldn't surprise me to see him become of our most famous science fiction writers. I believe that his potential is that high.

B009J2VR3Y|4.0|I will always love Whitney but this sounds like a missed opportunity to put out more of her unreleased tracks, demos, live recordings and b sides. Moment Of Truth was awesome! I'm wondering why this isn't on ANY album. What about Miracle from I'm Your Baby Tonight? That was so heartfelt and beautiful. The top ten Star Spangled Banner? And nothing from the recent Sparkle soundtrack? Sony/Arista should vary the list instead of releasing the same old (but well loved) songs.<br /><br />Compare this to the 2 CD Greatest Hits and The Ultimate Collection. Even the international Love Whitney had Miracle and Until You Come Back. You will be tempted to opt for these - if you haven't got them already.<br /><br />If you haven't got her earlier albums, it's worthwhile to pick up the UK deluxe version.<br /><br />Tracks on disc 2:<br /><br />Love Will Save The Day<br />One Moment In Time<br />It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be (with Aretha Franklin)<br />My Name Is Not Susan<br />I Belong To You<br />Run To You<br />Queen Of The Night<br />Count On Me (with Cece Winans)<br />Step By Step<br />It's Not Right But It's Okay<br />I learned From The Best<br />If I Told You That<br />Heartbreak Hotel<br />Million Dollar Bill<br /><br />Since all of these songs are on her albums, singles and other comps, the option of downloading the new songs is very attractive indeed.

I just loved it and thought it was everything I would want in an animated film. It had guts and it had heart.

B003EYVXYQ|4.0|I like this much better than Diary and think that as far as what i like to see for zombie movies, George still does it best.  I praise him for not falling into what people \\"believe\\" to be the evolution of the zombie film and continuing down his own path; sticking to his original view and that over time zombies \\"can\\" in theory learn and/or recall part of their past life.  He balances action and dialogue WITH zombies very well and never focuses too long on people yelling at each other or excessive character development.  It is a zombie film that doesn't forget that i am here to see ZOMBIES!<br /><br /> No shaky cam thank goodness!  I am so very sick of shaky cam and yelling as a pathetic attempt to create tension or suspense and love his ability to make you feel that the zombies are a threat, not just a target for cool people to look cool by shooting them or bashing their heads in. It is lighthearted at times, but never overburdens the overall film.<br /><br /> The effects are the now trademark mixed bag of very good practical and CG, but it is no more silly than movies that people would try suggest as being \\"better\\", i believe that many people only use this as an excuse, since many films others think are \\"the greatest\\" i find the CG in as \\"laughable\\" so we shall negate the CG argument.  Other than these moments, the practical effects and zombies look great and are very memorable.  You will likely not find zombie A and zombie B blending in to a forgettable sea of \\"those things that we must look cool while killing\\"  They are as distinguishable as the main cast.  The package ends up being a good blend of style and story with zombies and very pleasing to watch... and even repeat view.<br /><br /> Not 5 stars, since i do count CG as evil and it is not over the top perfection.  As a 25 year fan of zombies i highly recommend this movie and find it holds true to what i find appealing about them as well as do justice to his original development or evolution of the zombie as awhole without making them run flailing their arms and silly while shaking the camera.  Thanks George!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This story was wonderful on a number of levels. For those who want a good story, real characters, and a plot this is for you. This story is also a blast from the past for those of us who grew up playing video games in the 80s. You can and will enjoy the story as a story, but for those who remember, it is also a wonderful flashback of 1980s references. I dont' want to ruin the enjoyment of the story but the story itself is an interesting take on fighting evil, life or the aproximation of it, and possible futures of what may happen when you spend too much time playing games. Hope you enjoy the read as much as I did.
B008476HBM|5.0|I could not finish this book before I watched the PBS mini series.  Once I knew the characters it was a very easy read.  Just too many facts for my brain.  But it is the best book every.  Great Love story.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|the game is entertaining but has too many glitches to play. it will freeze up lose your progress and then make you start over and over before you accomplish anything. not worth your time until they fix the programing problems.

0316228532|1.0|There isn't a single character in this book who is likeable.  Having read the Harry Potter series several times I was so dissapointed in reading this depressing book.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|If you've read the movie title and seen the cover and are interesting in watching this movie, there's a pretty good chance you will like it. It's beautiful, well acted, and the action scenes are done well. Even the history is accurate-ish enough to create a delightful counterpoint to the over-the-top supernatural stuff.
B008OHV4PG|3.0|I'm sure this would be good.  Previous film Heart of Gold was great.  Pity I can't watch it.  This is the first region specific NY Bluray.  Now I'm in region 2 with a great brand new region 1 bluray.  Who would have thought?  Certainly no one who was involved in the disc's promotion.  One of those problems with early ordering.

0142420891|5.0|The item was received very quickly and was exactly as described in its description.  This item is in great condition and I'm sure I will enjoy it.
1423140605|5.0|So let me say this from the start, This is by far THE BEST BOOK in the Heroes of Olympus Series.<br /><br />I guess it is no secret of you arrive at this book 3 both camps, the Roman and The Greek have joined forces. Or at least the people involved in the quests from the 2 previous books. And I think it really did a huge impact on this book. It made it more diverse and really dynamic since there are a lot of characters to play with.<br /><br />Positive thing number 1 for me is that the quest is equally good and interesting as the previous ones. There are some gods, demigods and monsters which are really fun to read. They add a good flavor to the overall story.<br /><br />And also for me the personality of each of the main characters are believable and it is nice to see the human side of them in this book. makes it much more realistic compared to them being portayed always as some demigods who have powers and always wins.<br /><br />There was a vulnerability and raw emotions also which I like very very much.<br /><br />Lastly I guess this is also the best ending so far in the series since it is a nice transition from this book with House of Hades. It will have a good continuity.<br /><br />Now on to some criticisms I can say.<br /><br />The first is that the cover was misleading!! I think I expected it to happen but when it happened I was disappointed on how it happened.<br /><br />Second one is some parts are really predictable. You will be able to someone sense what will happen or who will appear and who will be their enemy.<br /><br />Overall, like I said this is the best book in the series so far!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!  I enjoy spending quiet time playing this game. I love being able to replay a game until I can solve it.
1439148953|2.0|I chose to read this book as it was highly acclaimed as one of the best historical novels, but I was very disappointed.  It does move slowly, but that is fine, we need not have gripping excitement in every page.  But an endless account of lifeless characters engaging in a dreadfully 'reactive' life was too much.  I also agree with other reviewers who found the main character self absorbed, insensitive, and unable to take charge of her life.  Finally, the absence of non-cluttered communication was annoying.  Doesn't anyone value clarity, honesty, integrity when they speak to each other?

B008I34Y6W|5.0|I would say Frank Zappa was on a roll during the mid 1970's. But that's not easy to say since since that roll seemed to extend pretty much from [[ASIN:B008B37CB8 Freak Out]] onward. More accurately this particular album might very well qualify as something of an apex to an enormous musical winning streak Zappa seemed to be on . With a band as talented and versatile as one including George Duke,Napoleon Murphy Broke,bassist Tom Fowler and of course Chester Thompson on drums it would be hard to strike out in any respect either. After a series of generally vocally and instrumentally accessible album in this direction Zappa and the Mothers,this album took these same musicians and the sound they created together to another level.<br /><br />  With the 8+ minute \\"Inca Roads\\" leading the way,it's clear even as George Duke croons in his wispy,melodic and soulful falsetto that this album would include more rhythmically and melodically complex songs such as these fast,and very instrumental oriented jazz-rock fusion number projects. That same musical flavor projects across some the this album on more crazily symphonic numbers such as \\"Florentine Pogen\\" and \\"Evelyn A Modified Dog\\". On \\"Can't Afford No Shoes\\" and \\"San Ber'dino\\",the latter featuring Johnny Guitar Watson Zappa rocks up the blues a bit more. My personal favorite numbers here are \\"Sofa No.2\\",featuring again George Duke's falsetto lead over his bouncy Moog bass for some scintillating funk as well as \\"Po-Jama People\\" and \\"Andy\\",the latter again featuring Johnny Guitar Watson and some of the sleekest soul/funk Zappa ever threw down.<br /><br />  Looking at this from the perspective of his musical longevity up to this point,this albums does a near perfect job at tying together the dramatic symphonic satirical rock opera type presentations of the first Mothers Of Invention in the late 60's/early 70's with the more soul and funkier jazz/rock fusion styled music Zappa would be dealing with in the mid 70's. Interestingly enough he's still in that latter time frame when this was made,however in a way this album provided the code to that by bringing everything he had done into mutual focus. And doing so in often very dramatic ways. While it doesn't possess as many stand alone  songs as some of the previous albums of this period in his career,this does point back to Zappa as being one of the ultimate album artists in terms of the whole of his presentation having a greater value than the sums of it's parts.ough he's still in that latter time frame when this was made,however in a way this album provided the code to that by bringing everything he had done into mutual focus.

B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Absolutely amazing I'll never look at Rome again. The legends of the Ancients with a modern twist. Can't wait for the next book.
B008I34ZUM|5.0|No need to go into what an incredible showman Frank Zappa and the Mothers were in any time period,any lineup change. The years 1973 and 1974 were extremely good years for Zappa. Not only had he released two commercially successful and creatively satisfying,but he had a band with personalities as energitic,eccentric and witty as himself in saxophonist Napoleon Murphy Brock and of course keyboard extraodinaire George Duke. Recorded live in Hollywood at the Roxy during both 1973 and Mothers Day 1974 shows there,this album was reissued on CD a few times before this,often remixing some of the songs (though Zappa itself makes it clear in the notes presented here many of the live tracks were overdubbed and remixed at the time anyhow). But all the same this documented the live experience of one of Zappa's most bountiful periods.<br /><br />  The album begins with \\"Penguin In Bondage\\",which Zappa introduces as one of his many songs with a sexual back round before going on into \\"Pygmy Twyltye\\" and specifically \\"Dummy Up\\",three of the most exciting funk style numbers FZ ever put his name to. The latter is especially fascinating in it's play between Zappa and Brock comically comparing contemporary high education to a drug habit.  \\"Village In The Sun\\" takes the groove to a slower,wonderfully reverbed kind of place as Zappa's intro reflects on the songs relation to his growing up. After this he heads into the spastic symphonic fusion of his classic \\"Echidna's Arf\\" before heading into the extend jazzier epic \\"Don't You Ever Wash That Thing\\". On \\"Cheepnis\\" Zappa's intro talks about is love of B-level monster movies on a witty and deliciously funky satirical number. \\"Son Of Orange County\\" and \\"More Trouble Every Day\\" offer up two more challenging jazz-rock numbers.<br /><br />  The album ends with my favorite number \\"Be Bop Tango (Of The Old jazzman's Church)\\" in which Zappa discusses modern day outlooks on human sexuality,it's relation to the tango and invites different people onstage to dance to George Duke's scatting,with some hilareous results. His conceptualisation here of what it is people are attuned to dance to in music illustrates a central point about this particular album. This album in many ways represents Zappa's live presentation when his music was likely at it's most funk oriented. Zappa's attitude,expressed on this albums closing number with Zappa instructing one of the dancers to loosen up rather than free their bodies,shows that his understanding of the funk era was actually quite high. Some might say this had to do with his exposure to George Duke and Napoleon Murphy Brock. Likely it was the other way though. Zappa always loved doo-wop and R&B. And continued to find ways to expand it to make it greasier in tone. So by providing that flavor himself,with intellectualy talented musicians much like himself  to help deliver that he had the perfect recipe for his own grooves and messagesage to dance to George Duke's scatting,with some hilareous results. His conceptualisation here of what it is people are attuned to dance to in music illustrates a central point about this particular album.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've been reading romance novels every night for the past 30 years. This one grabs you in and will not let go.  She writes their story so well, that you feel like you are right on their shoulders, feeling and experiencing everything with them.  I had not read 50 Shades when I read these novels, so I picked them up and was disappointed.  Sylvia has done a wonderful job and I can't wait for #3! (Don't tell my husband that I think about Gideon often - hahaha)
0307960471|4.0|Phantom is the first Harry Hole and the first Jo Nesbo novel I've read.  He lives up to the hype.  Nordic crime fiction seems to share a sort of dark and moody atmosphere.  Nesbo has that too, but he also has more action and intensity than some of the other Nordic novelists I've read.  Having not read any Harry Hole books before, I felt I was able to pick up on the character and his background rather quickly.  Reading earlier novels in the series would be helpful and perhaps enrich the experience, but it is not necessary to read them in order to enjoy this book..<br /><br />Harry Hole is an outstanding character.  Dark, brooding, and trapped by his policeman nature that doesn't allow him to pursue his own happiness.  He recognizes that there are any number of choices along the way, but he always picks the one that drags him in deeper and leads him closer to the truth.<br /><br />Nesbo paints a grim and unforgiving picture of Oslo and particularly the drug scene there.  Harry Hole's outlook is nearly as dark.  He knows he has a blind spot for Rakel and Oleg, the woman he left behind and her son, but he fights through it to find the truth behind the murder Oleg has been accused of.  His own alcoholic past leaves him few friends among his former police colleagues upon whom he can rely.  Where others are willing to accept easy answers, Harry keeps pushing, no matter the personal cost.<br /><br />Phantom is an intense book, and the last half of the book rushes at you with a series of twists and turns that keeps you guessing and a shocking ending that will stick with you long after you put the book down.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of this book

B0013IKUIK|4.0|I once read or heard that Bon Iver is like being in an elevator on qualudes. I can't speak from experience, but I kind of can see what that means, and I agree in a way. It's a fun thing to listen to and just let the thing roll over you, and it's also great weekend morning music/background music.
B007EECSFA|2.0|Applegirl44's review is very similar to my feelings about this book.  While others may have found their way through the maze that is this story, I did not.<br /><br />I have tried multiple times to write this review and I can't even do this well; it is only by reading a comment to another review that I can see how much I missed in reading this story.<br /><br />Suffice to say, this is not my favorite Kate Morton book and I would warn the reader that you must pay close attention or you will be as confused as I, and others, have been.
B009DA74ES|3.0|CALIFORNICATION, for me, was initially a show about a bitter, desperate and damaged artist looking to regain his muse and the child they share whilst he made increasingly poor decisions in regards to sex, drugs and his career. Hank Moody felt like a true American original, or at least an original in terms of what American society has bred; a frustrated writer with one hit book turned into an abysmal Hollywood rom-com whose Peter Pan complex regarding women, sex, booze, drugs and generally irresponsible behavior is just barely trumped by his fairy-tale love for his beautiful and almost impossibly cool \\"baby mama\\" and their cherubic, wise-beyond-her-years daughter. The conceit of the show essentially is how he keeps trying against his nature to be a decent guy, a good father and a responsible human being, and that gives us a great and unique character with a lot of internal struggle going on. It also doesn't hurt that the show has a pretty astounding cast, with David Duchovny firmly holding the show together with his mix of humor, melancholy, and seductiveness. Each season has dealt with a new facet of Hank's continuing out-of-control spiral and how he either gets back in the good graces of his great love and his daughter, or loses even more control of the situation.<br /><br />But with Season Five, the show seems to be running on auto-pilot as it continues to put Hank in increasingly absurd situations with new groups of people that will eventually be an outlet for his creativity and his sexual thirst.<br /><br />This season shows the return of Hank back to Los Angeles after slightly over a two-year return back to New York as he begins to work in a psuedo-hack capacity as a writer for a lame action-comedy under the control of rapper-turned-actor Samurai Apocalypse (The RZA). Returning for action as well is Hank's muse Karen (Natascha McElhone), their daughter Becca (Madeline Martin), his agent/best friend Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler), Charlie's ex-wife Marcy (Pamela Adlon), and her new husband and movie producer Stu (the awesome Stephen Tobolowsky). Karen has gotten married to novelist Richard Bates (Jason Beghe) in this hiatus, Becca has started college and is dating a slightly older grad student and hipster tool Tyler (Scott Michael Foster), and Marcy has given birth to Charlie's baby. On the flight from NY to LA, Hank meets the beautiful Kali (Meagan Good) and there is that instant attraction that leads to something slightly physical on the flight. It is, naturally, later that Hank finds out that Kali is the girlfriend of the extraordinarily jealous Samurai Apocalypse. Then the situation becomes increasingly more insane as seemingly divergent roads all head on a collision course toward one another. Cop ride-alongs, falling off the wagon, professional discourtesy, rap culture posturing, the never-ending parade of women and the never-ending pummelling of Hank from his loved ones as they call out all of his flaws and as he continues to create situations he cannot extricate himself from.<br /><br />Hank Moody is clearly a man who is less in love with the woman of his dreams and more in love with his charming, roguish, devil-may-care attitude about life and responsibility. He keeps trying to live up to the standards that others have set for him to be something more than he is, but it just seems to be more that what he truly wants. Aside from his obvious concern for Becca, Hank is a pretty unlikable but still strangely admirable human being; he's a being driven purely by the moment. He has no respect for the past and no regard for the future, and this is one of the reasons that I love this show. Having your main character be kind of repellant, despite his obvious charm, is a great idea to build an edgy post-modern comedy around, and the first few seasons were rife with dark and compelling moments for Hank that were very bracing and fascinatingly cruel. With this season, though, they literally seem to have run out of ways to tell that story, so the focus seems to be making Hank more likable and having his flaws seem more cute than compelling. The show therefore suffers because by making Hank a more likeable character, they lose part of the purpose of the show; to challenge you to like a very unlikable man and want to follow him on his adventures through the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the entertainment business.<br /><br />Of course, the season still has some really strong comedic moments. Hank's quips are still razor-sharp, Charlie (with the help of Handler's giant infant visage) is the perpetual Charlie Brown of this show as he continually makes one poor decision after another, and Stu, as handled by Tobolowsky, is a joy to watch as the single greatest character actor schlub gets to play against type as a true power-player and a man of legendary endowment.<br /><br />Sadly, it's the women who suffer the most in this season. Karen is the hot-and-cold-running ex who seems to be still very much in love with Hank one moment and then utterly repulsed by him the next. Becca similarly has the many of those character beats, but with slightly more gravitas, because Madeline Martin plays her so well. Marcy is so incredibly irritating in this season with her constant ascerbic commentary and seemingly no real concern for her child, which is a shame because Adlon is such a terrific performer. Meghan Good is fine as Kali, but doesn't get much time to shine here. The two women that make the biggest impact this season are guest stars Drea De Matteo as a stripper with little-to-no impulse control and Natalie Zea as Hank's psychotic ex.<br /><br />This brings me to something else that has been kind of an issue from the beginning which is the arguable casual misogyny that takes place in this show. Los Angeles is either populated by literal or figurative whores; women who will do just about anything with anyone at any time. It's more likely that this is an unintentional result of the way that creator/showrunner Tom Kapinos wishes to tell Hank's story as well as presenting Los Angeles as a modern-day Sodom and Gommorah where debauchery runs rampant, but it seems much more evident in this season since none of the female characters seem to have any real confidence, power or control over their lives, unless it's sexual politics, and this is pretty troubling. Even though we're essentially done with the character of Mia, at least she had an interesting arc.<br /><br />I guess the real question is if I disliked this season as much as I apparently do, why do I still give it an above-average rating? As a man, there's something about this show that still appeals to the adolescent in me, and I don't know if it's the constant cavalcade of casual nudity, filthy jokes, or wish-fulfillment fantasy, but it's something, and I still think that Hank Moody is a very special character, and I'm hoping that this next season will be more about character and less about events, because Season Five of CALIFORNICATION, while still somewhat appealing, is certainly its weakest.hat story, so the focus seems to be making Hank more likable and having his flaws seem more cute than compelling.

B004UQ03P2|4.0|This product lives up to its claims.  Shiny viewing screens make my eyes tired so this product helps A LOT.  Before anything, yes, carefully clean and prep your laptop screen.  Zip open the package, pull it out, peel off the backing and stick in place.  More than likely you will need a few quick and easy adjustments.  A few bubbles appeared but worked themselves out to minimal bumps along the black edges.  Don't force the bubbles out too hard.  Now my screen looks great and NOT shiny.

B0015XWUCC|5.0|Daived bowies career wasn't what it was, but this one really brought him back into focus ,with strong songs and tight melodies. It's one of his better efforts and his musings on getting older are truly relevant and make this one a mature effort by  a true original. It's the best one he did since lets dance for sure. Get it, it's worth owning and a very poignant cd. It's about reality, his and yours.

B000PDYVVG|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much and got a lot from it for myself!  It was an interesting read for 98% of the book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is there is a section where Elizabeth goes into quite a lot of detail on what she learned in India about the process of meditating and all that is involved and our inner selves that it got a little too much for me to comprehend without any knowledge of this process at all. But, that did not detract from her overall experience and I was so intrigued by this book that I bought her next book and am reading it now.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Having seen several versions of this story done in film, I wanted to know the original by the author, Jane Austen, so purchased this for my Kindle.  I was pleased to see that most of the films did follow this book but also to read the details that are often left out of time-constrained movie productions.  I've done this with several films that I liked and knew were based on books.  As much as people seem to be in a digital world of films, books are still the best way to fully know a story.
B005PK553C|5.0|great show was always entertained. I could not belive how it ended they shpuld have had the second season pickup where they left off
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Too many people only know these classic stories by what the film industry has provided instead of the original by the author.  I was guilty of this myself and wanted to original story.  I had seen some earlier versions in film, in black and white, that followed this original nearly word by word so that was refreshing to see that someone got it right.  Of course, the premise of Scrooge has been done and overdone to the point of silliness these days, but now I know the version as it was orignally designed and perhaps can watch these film versions with that knowledge.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show has everything you could want action,blood,gore and of course love. The story line is great and you are always left wanting more

B000IY06CK|5.0|This is an oustanding disc by the brilliant young violinist Julia Fischer. Her technique and tonal colouring are impeccable. As I mentioned in the Mozart review she has now moved on from Pentatone and is in the Decca stable of brilliant female violinists.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn's greatest gift is her ability to create realistic characters.  She seems to empathize with all sorts of people from the down-and-out to the elite, from the intellectual to the simple, from the out-of-touch to the most manipulative of us.  She has a real gift of being able to bring you in and make you want to stay.  This story made me ache for exhausted and beaten Patty, misunderstood, alone Ben, and tough survivor Libby.  Gillian's words weave you in to the fabric of the tale as if you're watching the whole story unfold from the sidelines...or like you're in Ben's or Libby's head.  Love this writer and her stories.  Can't wait for more!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|A beautifully written story with characters who draw you in. Loved the twist at the end. Another gem from Ms Morton.
B004XZR63M|1.0|My intention was to write a 1,000 words, minimum, review trying to convey as clear as possible why this book is absolutely hideous and reprehensible, specially after seeing that it has an almost 4 stars rating. It was never my intention to read this book, I knew it was full of senseless rhetoric. But a friend of mine asked me to read it because he wanted to discuss it with me. I'm glad I did because I could change my friend's original opinion of this book by pointing out all the fallacies, over simplifications, and detrimental individualistic ideals that this book endorses.<br /><br />Fortunately I won't have to elaborate more beyond of what I already wrote because there already are many sensible, well-thought reviews posted, which I didn't expect because I know many people who have read this and liked it.<br /><br />The only good reason for reading this book is to grasp a deeper insight of its message to critically deconstruct it to others and let them know why the author is wrong and purposefully misleading. I can imagine that this book is a must in the shelves of every right-wing extremist.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I purchased this CPU for my HTPC ,I have to tell you it's very fast I am running windows 8 with ssd hard drive , it takes less that 6 seconds to boot up and the performance is stunning. because it's i3 doesn't mean it's slower there are too many i3 cpus but this one is the good one. you can play games anything with this cpu but remember Graphic card is important in games so get a gtx650 or something like that.
1476715904|2.0|Giving this book 2 stars is rather generous, but I'm in that kind of mood today.  I suppose the thing that bugged me the most about this story is the extremely immature way the 2 main characters, Lake and Will, handled their relationship. They hardly knew each other, went on one date, and when they found out that they could not take their relationship on a second date ... a SECOND DATE ... they kept going over, and over, and over about WHY WHY WHY?  To me, it was way too extreme. Again they barely knew each other and Lake practically goes psycho. I found this to be very unhealthy, and I just couldn't shake that irritation as the book ... um ... \\"progressed.\\"<br /><br />Slow-moving and downright painful at times, I do enjoy the writer's way of having the characters lay out their emotions. Lake's little brother, Kel, warmed my heart as well. So there's where the second star comes in. Other than that, I guess you need to be under 18 years-old to \\"get\\" the way young teenagers ... and young adults, as in Will's place ... are not mature enough to handle grown-up situations.
B004WY2M8I|4.0|This is my 3rd or 4th time reading The Vampire Chronicles. The last time was at least 15 years ago and time has a way of changing things. Vampires are everywhere now but Anne's version is still one of the best. Anne's writing is intelligent, complex, historic, romantic and far above that of most of here colleague's. While I remembered loving Interview with a Vampire I forgot that it was actually The Vampire Lestat that I loved and overshadowed Interview. Interview was just soooo whiney and makes Edward (or so I've heard) see butch. That said, in order to love Lestat, you must read Interview and unlike many, I equally enjoyed Queen of the Damned. When reading Chronicles, you not only get a good vampire story and history, you get a more realistic telling of history than you do in most movies or even in history classes. The books hold up well considering they revolve around Lestat's rebirth in the early 80's. One star off for a really whiney Louis.

B000FA5SMK|5.0|This is, as one would expect from this author, a completely engaging book.  Part of its allure is that the puzzle is solved well before the end, but proving the premise and capturing the killers become the fascinating focus.  The characters are adroitly handled, and John Cory is at his wise cracking best, though we see the very decent person just beneath the surface.  The setting is stunning, and the storm and the boat chase at the end reminded me just a little of Joseph Conrad's Typhoon.  While I'll admit that I preferred Lion's Game, this is undoubtedly a 5 star book, and, to be honest, I'm glad I wasn't reading it during Hurricane Sandy!<br /><br />I especially like Mr. DeMille's crisp writing style, which moves his stories along very nicely, and his action scenes are more than a little spectacular, too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. Play it on my kindle and my phone so I am never bored when travelling or waiting at an appointment
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I bought this product for golf since my depth perception is getting worse. It's amazingly accurate even with pins that don't have prism reflectors. I like that it gives precise distances to trees and sand traps as well. The rangefinder works so well that I started using it at work to measure distance when we are measuring radio communication range. As long as I use a prism reflector, I can get accurate readings (within 1 meter) from well over 600 meters away - much further than I can even see through the viewer. (The fact that the Bushnell rangefinder will display the measurement in either yards or meters is especially helpful).
B009AMANBA|2.0|It's impossible to exaggerate how awful this movie is in absolutely<br />every aspect - writing, music, cinematography, directing, conception.<br />The acting is competent at best, but it's hard to tell with cardboard<br />characters. Daniel Day Lewis is OK but forgettable. The movie might as<br />well have been a Chamber of Commerce campaign commercial. If I were<br />black I'd be angry and embarrassed as hell at this patronizing, boring<br />concoction. Doris Kearns Goodwin should sue and ask for her name to be<br />removed. Spielberg should do America a favor by giving up filmmaking;<br />it's time for him to change his underwear. He's sterile. More sickening<br />than the film has been the public and critical reaction, which must<br />have all have been based on promotional materials or guilty, patriotic<br />desperation due to Petraeus' decline. No one who would have had to sit<br />through this infantile tableau - often barely visible on screen - could<br />ever lie about it so effortlessly. I hope to god the Oscars ignore it<br />As a work of film art, Birth of a Nation has much more to offer. The<br />entire production offers a rationale for why Americans ignore and hate<br />history.

Story still holds up the next time around, although you do have to question what they woudl do without Daisey  - she seems to be in the middle of everything.<br /><br />As for the streaming video - two things that make the streaming Video two stars.  First it does not have subtitles - why on earth is that!  Second, I cannot save the file to my home NAS (Network Attached Storage) that is the whole reason I bought it.  Amazon needs to fix bot of these problems.
B00012QM8G|5.0|what an incredible movie,Liam Neeson,Ben Kingsley do an outstanding job.Also Ralph Fiennes playing of the Real-life Nazi Officer is very real.You wish someone would whack this guy early on.Liams' portrayal of Oskur Schindler is Mind-Blowing,it seems that His purpose in Life was to keep as many Jewish People from being Cremated,Beaten,Shot or Tortured to Death and in the end He only wished that He could have saved more.Some Actors complete a part so well that You always remember that Actor for that particular part.I have seen Mr. Neeson and Mr. Kingsley in many different parts but they will always be remembered by Me as Oskur S. and Itzhak S. in this Incredible Documentary of when  part of Mankind lost its mind.This movie will make you want to research its real-life people either at the Library,Online or both.Even the man who called the office of Steven Speilberg for 11 years to tell Him the story of Oskur Schindler.Believe Me,You will watch this movie over and over and over!!!

B0001US8EO|5.0|By Far this is the Best Biography of Wyatt Earp.Although \\"Tombstone\\" hit the screens 1st \\"Wyatt Earp\\" tells the 87% of His Life excluding His passing.\\"Tomstone which I also enjoyed is basically about The Gunfight at the OK Corral but also is factual.Dennis Quaid as \\"Doc Holliday\\" plays the part 100% and even looks like photographs of Holliday.Kevin Cosner plays Wyatt Extremely well is one of my favorite western actors and there are not too many actors today that can play a Cowboy like an actual cowboy of The Old West.I did research of Wyatt Earp and the movie is just about 100% true.Was Big-Nosed Kate last name Elder? Remember a ealier movie with John Wayne,Dean Martin,Earl Holliman Etc. called \\"The Sons of Kate Elder?\\" I will let you researd to see if these movies were connected by the same Kate.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The Jack Reacher series is the best book series I've read in a long time...Can't wait to read the next one.  I have read over 14 books in the &#34;Reacher&#34; series and all were top notch.  Thrilling, exciting and they grab you from the start.  Even my husband loves this series and normally we don't read the same thing.  He's really glad I put him on to &#34;Jack Reacher&#34;...thank you Lee Child...keep it up!!!!!!!!!!!

B003VS0CXS|5.0|If you loved the original movie you will love it even more in blu-ray.  I remember watching this movie in VHS with my daughter when she was growing up.  She loved it then and now she loves it even more in blu-ray.  It now has more clarity, better sound and seems more detailed and it even makes your memories more vivid.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Charlize Theron was excellent and everything else mediocre. The dwarfs had some character and talent. The screenplay was actually pretty boring and predictable. I kept watching in hopes of improvement in dialog or character or relationships. Very superficial.
B0083Z614S|5.0|There is nothing to dislike about this almost magical classic.  Engaging characters dish out comeuppance, snide one-liners, and ultimately, redemption.

B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Oliver Stone and this movie have left me asking, \\"All of this for a little tweed?!\\" Maybe it was an underlying message about leagalizing marijuana. I don't know. I do know smoking bud has never done anything for me and sharing a woman isn't what I'm about. So the movie really didn't captivate me. Although the acting was great and the cinematography was excellent. So if ya don't mind sharing women with your bros and if you sit on the couch all day and toke you might like this movie...

I kept trying and found myself forcing myself to read on..finally I had to stop.  Its on my when I retire and need a project shelf.  Honestly what really made me stop and think was how did she write all the Harry books and skip all of the profanity she is so well versed in! She certainly does not hesitate to use her library of \\"bad words\\" in just the first few pages.  But I fell for the buy me and learned a lesson to never jump at a book just because it has so many great previous books.  The theme changed and maybe that was the problem, I was looking forward to a JK I knew and the profanity was not her and the endless chatter added to the fact that I should not of purchased this book.

B00005N52P|4.0|'The Last Picture Show' takes place in a fictional small town (Anarene) in north Texas during 1951-52, covering the coming of age of Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and his friend Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges). Others in the star-studded film include Ben Johnson, Eileen Brennan, Ellen Burstyn, Cloris Leachman, Randy Quaid, and John Hillerman. The plot is loaded with affairs between married people and their teenagers. Eventually Duane joins the Army, Jacy (Sybil) leaves for Dallas, the town's unofficial leader, Sam the Lion (Johnson) dies, and the town's theater closes for lack of business.

B006O2QNOU|3.0|I am no fan of \\"slice of life\\" genre movies that just whisk us into the lives of a group of people, let us watch like peeping toms and then whisk us back out with little resolution. That is how I felt watching this movie. It had just enough spark to keep me watching until the end, hoping for a pay-off that would sock it to the evil corporate bosses....yet it left me unfulfilled. Worth watching only if there is nothing better to do. The acting from Spacey, Tucci and Bettany added enough drama to get 3 stars. I deducted two star for extremely mellow ambiance and the abrupt ending without a strong resolution. I needed some, at least one, of the employees to go just a wee bit postal to make this movie believable. No blood, No Guts = No Glory!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Overview:<br /><br />I have been using this backpack for 1.5 years now. I use it everyday carrying it to and from class, plus use it commonly for travelling. I typically stuff it to the brim, fitting my large 17\\" laptop, 2 small textbooks, a binder, a large spiral notebook, a few folders, mouse, mouse pad, power cords, and so forth. So far, never struggled to get in all in there, though, does get heavy. Comes with cushions on the back to make it comfortable to wear.<br />Great Product.<br /><br />********<br />Comfort:<br />********<br />This backpack has thick straps that do not dig in, though they are not heavily padded. In terms of comfort, that would be my only complaint, though it has not bothered me. The back itself does come with nice size pads, with breathing room between them to give you back some circulation to help keep cool. The straps are easily adjustable and fits well on my back. (I'm a thin, 5'11\\" guy).<br /><br />******<br />Build:<br />******<br />The backpack seems to be built well, able to handle a heavy load. It comes with a heavy duty handle on top, though it can be slightly deceiving. The handle itself is very strong, with metal cable strengthening it. Unfortunately, it's attached to the backpack itself by sown cloth. Not as dramatic, but that's like attaching a metal bridge to the ground with string. The cloth is attached securely and does provide a little extra faith that the handle won't rip if I carry my bag by it.<br /><br />I get a lot of use from the bag and have no frayed threads or any noticeable wear and tear yet. Zippers all work perfectly still as well.<br /><br />As far as room, you get a lot. The back compartment can easily fit my Dell XPS 17\\" laptop, plus a folder and my power cord. Then a small, easy to access pocket on top can fit passport, wallet, camera, and more. Two other main pockets can fit the load of stuff I mentioned in the overview. Though it starts to get snug, it does offer great room. These pockets also have one built in divider, and a mesh zip up compartment. Nice to organize if you have a lot of stuff to haul around. The front pocket is quite large as well, though has slots for pens, pencils, etc. The bag also has a small, side zip up pocket, large enough to fit some pencils or other smaller items, and each side has a small mesh pocket. Unfortunately, I do not think the mesh pockets could easily fit any water bottle. I know a lot of people really want this feature. I have been able to easily fit my water bottle in the backpack when not carrying many textbooks though.uilt in divider, and a mesh zip up compartment.

1619691825|4.0|I love this series and The Panther stepped it up in the witty, quickly moving along for me.  Maybe because I was ready for another dose of these characters :-)  I love the detail including accurate history and wonderful conspiracy theory inspiration I get from reading DeMille. John Corey seemed extra witty in this book and I recommend it as I do the others in this series. I wish they could come out faster but I know I'd perhaps sacrafice detail.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a beautiful film. Jiro doesn't just dream of sushi, he also makes his dreams a reality. A sushi chef who has been practicing the art since he was 10 years old, Jiro is not only a master, but he is also a great teacher. I would love to be able to eat at his restaurant, but as the film reveals, its 3 Michelin stars were given not to Jiro but to his son. This heritage of sushi-making as an art will be passed on to the next generation, and hopefully this skill and knowledge will spread to sushi restaurants around the world. In the meantime, I hope that the sushi I eat is even half as good as the sushi Jiro and his sons are making. Respect.

B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|horror that covers every flavor of fear, from suspense to thought provoking mental trips. Its like the early scream slashers wrapped in a mystery that as you figure more and more out, you also feel your self slipping into that dark psychosis deep inside you. Who doesn't like being going a bit crazy from time to time, all the while periodically being suspended in heart pounding action.  I often find myself saying out loud, &#34;NO DONT GO IN THERE!!&#34; or &#34;HE&#34;S RIGHT BEHIND YOU, TURN AROUND, TURN AROUND!!&#34; i have never seen anything like it, and the second season is by no means a cookie cutter version of the first, it has its own feel and plot direction, keeping you on edge with each new installment. Even the opening music, there is a certain level of discomfort that sets the tone for the episode that follows. As of yet there has never been an episode that didn't leave me on the edge of me seat hating the fact that i have to wait a week for the outcome/

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This latest book by John Grisham is another of his fast paced page turners.  Having read almost, if not all, of his books before I thought I had the story pegged about 1/2 way through.  I was on a long flight with my wife and she heard me chuckling about it.  I described the story so far (very good to this point) and that I had a good guess as to the outcome.  Dead wrong!  It was nothing like I thought.  He did it again.  I'll read anything by John Grisham.  Loved the work.

0743297334|3.0|My husband had never read this classic, and is enjoying it, altho he finds it it to be about the 1920s.  It is written in the first person by an author living in France and the last half of the book is about his visit to Spain during bullfighting week.  My husband says he feels the &#34;story is dragged out&#34; but this known famous writer is interesting, and it's good to be acquainted with one of his most famous books.  He enjoyed the author's A  Moveable Feast much more because this concentrates on France in the 1920s and devotes a few chapters to Scott Fitzgerald, which made it more interesting. to him.

1451626657|4.0|Nice book. Will be a Christmas gift, so we have to wait for the comments but the price was okay !
1451662432|5.0|It is a revealing and inspiring account of his life so far.  The flow of the book is smooth, each chapter represents an era of his life.  I can't believe how detailed he could recall chronologically.  He shares his real estate ventures.  For example, it is interesting to know he would only pay 10 times multiple of annual rent back in 1980 in Santa Monica to buy a multi-family.  Exotic investment like buying a 747 and renting it out to airlines is an eye opener to me.  I am not political but learning about his account on campaigning and being a governer of Calfornia captivating.  In the final chapter, he wraps it up by summarizing what the principles work for him and what experience has shaped him.  The book celebrates and mentions regrets.  I will name it Total Recall in Hi-Def.  God bless Arnold and his family.  I hope Maria will forgive and they will re-unite.

B004G606K8|5.0|I read this series in the 80's, and i consider it to be the best story I have ever read.
0345803485|2.0|I have never read \\"erotica\\" before this book, so I'm not exactly sure how it rates to other erotica reads. I started reading this because of all the hype....BIG mistake. I really can't see how this has become a bestseller...and not just this one but all three!?<br /><br />Does it get better?? The storyline seemed a little off. Really, a 26 yr old \\"perfect\\" in every way billionaire? This really MUST be someone's fantasy. I can't remember - did they ever mention what Mr. Grey's company was??<br /><br />I'd say the storyline was intriguing without all the sex...but the story line never got anywhere. Every time some sort of hint of a story came (ex: how Mr Grey became so many shades of *&*#& up) to the surface the author just watered it down with so much sex...the story just seemed to float away.<br /><br />Not to mention the sex was so repeatitive...I just don't get the appeal of this book or the two that follow. I won't even bother to pick up and read the other two...it took all I had just to make it through the first one. It was just bad all the way the around.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Good storyline but very scary and creepy. I only got through the first two episodes before I wimped out. It should be noted that I generally do not watch horror but got sucked in by all the hype.

A little too catastrophic for me to continue. Maybe this will be the rare instance when the movie is actually better than the book.

B00A8D0XZG|1.0|I guess after reading all the Sherlock Holmes novels and viewing the old T.V. series with Jeremy Brett, and now the new BBC's \\"Sherlock\\" on Public Broadcasting, it was inevitable that I would not like CBS's \\"Elementary\\".  It's an also-ran vehichle where CBS attempts to cash in on the success of the BBC's \\"Sherlock\\", and fails miserably. I am sure that many folks (not all, but many) who have never read the novels or seen Jermey Brett's Sherlock Holmes series, or the BBC's \\"Sherlock\\", will find this show entertaining. So be it. It's their loss.<br /><br />The BBC's \\"Sherlock\\" packs 90-minutes episodes with so much information that it takes several viewings to actually appreciate all that is going on.  The series does not insult the intelligence of the viewer - quite the contrary, the show requires such concentration from the viewer that one actually feels mentally exhausted afterwards.  I have seen each of the episodes (there have been only six) three times, and still I find new facts or digalog that escaped me on previous viewings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Sherlock\\" only produces three episodes a year, leaving fans having to wait a year or more for new material. What does one do in the meantime?  Watching \\"Elementary\\" is not a option. One can only feel the pangs of longing for Sherlock even stronger.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are several good mystery series such as \\"House\\" (Dr. Gergory House reminds me SO much of Sherlock), \\"The Mentalist\\", or \\"Monk\\".<br /><br />I think the real problem with Elementary is taking Sherlock Holmes out of London, where he belongs, and ploping him down in NY in a CSI crime scene. No one does Sherlock better than the British.  And I have to say that some of the British mystery shows on Public Broadcasting are worth your while - Inspector Morse, Wallender, Foyle's War, etc.<br /><br />I am so greatful to 'Sherlock' for introducing me to the novels of Sir Authur Connon Doyle, the Grenada televsion series with Jeremy Brett, and to otherfine British mystery shows on Public Broadcasting. I am certainly richer for it.<br /><br />So, give a pass on Elementary, and immerse yourself instead in the shows I've just mentioned, to tide you over until the Fall of 2013, when \\"Sherlock\\" will again make it to our airwaves with three, count them - three - new episodes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00499LTLM A Study in Pink [HD]]]

I not only purchased the mp3 album but also bought the CD to play in my car. I'm looking forward to future releases from Adele; she's going to be around for a very long time.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I found this book to be not up to his usual pace.  The ending was entertaining, but getting there was NOT half the fun.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is an unusual book and I bought it because a review caught my interest.I had trouble putting it down because I wanted to see where he went next. The change in him and ultimately his marriage made fascinating reading. The book has many twists and turns and the ending is not what you expect.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book is extremely interesting and thought provoking. Well written, the author uses his personal history as well as his professional knowledge to describe his most profound experience.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If all adult fiction were this dreary, I should probably stick to children's books or find a different hobby. What a let down after all the fun, magic, villains to hate and many likable characters in the Harry Potter books. The one character who might have been a half way nice guy in this novel died on page four. I slogged through all 503 pages of the dismal, dysfunctional lives of this community, toddlers through grannies. Having a few rays of hope for some of these folks in the last chapter isn't enough. What a bummer. If I read another book by J.K. Rowling, I'll borrow it from the library rather than purchasing it. I'll also stop by page fifty if I don't like it. That said, Rowling still writes well, but do we really another cheerless tale? Life is already so full of them.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I have to say I'm more than non-plussed by the backlash surrounding this album, for it's my favorite since \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\". I'm glad Diana Krall took the chance and chose to tackle new kinds of material with a whole new band. The result is riveting, and showcases Diana's incredible talent at creating a unique musical and rhythmical atmosphere. Her take on \\"Wild River to cross\\" is one of the most poignant performances she's ever delivered, and her \\"Lonely Avenue\\" wanders freely in a both melancholic and delightful way. The title track is also hauntingly beautiful and dramatic (although the piano version featured on the Deluxe edition is by far superior), and other efforts like \\"You KNow - I Know...\\", \\"I'm a little Mixed Up\\" and \\"There Ain't no Sweet Man\\" are just irresistible! Far from her last, more predictable efforts,  Diana has finally decided to let lose again, and hits the nail right on the head. Bravo!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This film isnt bad considering the hype.  It's a little unrealistic that one man would run around the town killing people without the police staying on him more.

B0098QAAAC|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie, and we were completely blown away by it. It wasn't mawkishly done, and the realism of the characters kept it from being formulaic. Instead it was bracing, funny, and incredibly touching. We would definitely recommend it, but with the caveat that with the honest portrayal of a man with cancer, there is a caution for those that may be affected by that. We felt this movie long after we finished watching it.

B008383GE8|5.0|This is the first time I have read Krauss and he did not disappoint. Brilliant summary of the state of the art in cosmology (which has changed so much in the last two decades). The content is very well presented and even a complete beginner will get a lot from this book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is brilliant, mostly because it's QUICK. I always have had great intentions to work out, but then daily distractions get in the way and going to the gym seems like such a time-drain. They beauty of this is that I can do it my bedroom, right when I wake up (& sometimes in my pjs). Because it's only 20 minutes, there really is no excuse NOT to work out (I do this workout 5x per week). I was concerned that the 20 mins wouldn't be enough, but for daily maintenance it's PERFECT. The only drawbacks -- and they are minor -- are that it takes a few minutes at the beginning of the DVD to get to the workouts, and also the canned music is repetitive and can get boring/grating (although most of the time I don't even notice it). I plan to continue this daily workout for the rest of my life (or until I get bored with it, by which time I hope she will have a new 20 minute daily workout).  My kids & husband often do this workout with me (level one)  -- we all find it fun!<br /><br />P.S. if you're already super fit this probably is not the DVD for you.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Little Dorrit is wonderful to watch. Hard to take, because the times were not that wonderful, but I highly recommend this CD
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The graphics are very intense. It's a great game to play. The way that the birds change into different characters are very funny. Spaceships, light savers you name it has it all.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is a really good movie I think. Jodie Foster did a great job. She's smart, & one of the best actors of our time. I am glad they shot this in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio so you can enjoy the whole movie as it was meant to be seen. The video is absolutely beautiful. One of the better Blu-rays I've seen. I can't comment on the audio too much as I listen on external speakers hooked up to my stereo. It sounds good in regular stereo anyway. There are some nice extras too. I say if you like this movie & are thinking of buying it in Blu-Ray, go ahead. You won't be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say. I loved the whole series of these books and read them all within a short period of time.
B003L16FAE|5.0|This is still a good movie after all this time. It has a good cast & lots of suspense & action. I don't get tired of watching this at all. I got it for less than $10.00 & I've seen it for even less than I paid for it. The Blu-ray comes across as pretty nice. It's much better than the regular Dvd. I do wish they would have put this out in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio rather than the 1:85:1 which it's in. I have external speakers hooked up to my regular stereo system so I can't really let you audiophiles know about the 5.1 digital DTS. There are a lot of special features that are pretty good too. I say if you don't have this in Blu-Ray & you like the movie, go ahead & get it. You will see a difference in video quality for sure.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can I say. I loved the whole series of these books and read them all within a short period of time.

0061969664|2.0|I'm a huge fan of this series, but after reading this book its starting to feel a bit repetitive. It felt that I was reading the previous book with subtle changes. It's disappointing for me because I was very excited to read this book and now I'm not sure if I'll buy the next one. It seems to me this series could go on and on and it just didn't hold my attention.
B00633W614|5.0|Characterizations are very good. Great story but as in the first one he left it with a cliff hanger. I hope there is a third book in the offing.
0307949486|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesting characters I've ever read. And Mikael, wasn't really a lovable kind of hero, but you had to like him. Even though he was riddled with faults. It was one of the best books I've read in a very long time. And I've read the other two. I don't know that I'll take the time to give a review for all three, so I'll just say I couldn't put any of them down. I finished this one, and moved on to The Girl Who Played with Fire, and directly to The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest with no interruption! I highly recommend all three.
B008OOYALE|5.0|feeding raising breeding cute new dragons. enjoy collecting money every hour. ways to earn gold from neighbors and quest. community still in demand.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This was a great story. I do not like to read about vampires and I almost put it down when I found out there would be more than just witches. I'm very glad I kept reading. Now you're wondering why I gave it a 3 star rating. It's because for me it had way too much description. I'd have to skim then I'd miss something. I have read Shadow of Night (book II) in the hopes the description would go away, not so much. If anything there was more. My desire to read the third book is zero because I don't want a history lesson.<br /><br />So back to my rating. It's an average. I gave the characters and story a 5 star and the description a 1 star, and came up with a 3 star. I recommend it to anyone who can muddle past all the description and if you like description than this will be the best book you've ever read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far so good, only they have managed to kill off nearly all the first seasons cast. Women are in short supply too. Interested in seeing where they go from here.

0756405890|5.0|Name of the Wind is an odd book. It's odd particularly because of the cliches you expect from it, and then all the cliches that it defies. This is, after all, the story of a young, powerful, brilliant Wizard, who has long flaming red hair, who goes on adventures, and who has a tragic past involving his parents being murdered by an evil, supernatural entity. Anyone who has read enough fantasy novels may at this point be tempted to skip over this for something fresh, not realizing that this is exactly what this book is.<br /><br />Saying anything else about this novel would spoil one of the greatest books I have ever read. This is a story that I can truly say is about both the journey, and the destination, and makes neither feel less important than the other. However, if you wish to know more, read on.<br /><br />Rothfuss writes with a passion that is sorely missing from modern novels. He is the rare writer who can make you feel with mere prose, and not only make you feel, but make you hurt, make you laugh, and make you feel all the rush of whatever he is describing. Kvothe, the main character, has a very normal life by fantasy standards, making the magnificent things that happen over the course of this book and its sequel truly stand out. Yet, the normal things are no less thrilling. A sequence in which Kvothe plays his lute in front of a crowd for the first time is more breathtaking and thrilling than even the most brutal sequences in Song of Ice and Fire. Unlike many storytellers, Rothfuss knows how to make the ordinary extraordinary, which in turn makes the extraordinary even moreso, and makes other fantasy novels feel dull in comparison. Sprinkled throughout this book are truths about life and about love, written with a love of life and a living sense of love. It could be argued that Rothfuss feels some of this love for every one of his characters. Many of which are described with such a vividness and sense of their inner beauty that it actually frustrates me that other books don't do the same.<br /><br />Read Name of the Wind, and its even better sequel. You won't regret it.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|A must for any Twilight fan to have this product! Gave it to a friend and she loved it. Great price too and fast service..
0553582038|2.0|**SPOILERS FOR FIRST THREE BOOKS**<br /><br />The war between the Lannisters and Starks is over, with the heads of both houses deceased, and control of the throne left up to a mentally ill Cersei Lannister. Now that the main conflict of Martin's story has abruptly concluded, does he still have enough forward momentum to keep it interesting?<br /><br />One Word Review: No.<br /><br />Many word review:<br /><br />I think many people are confused about why this book is so much less compelling than the others in the series. When asked why, the average reader may say \\"it doesn't have any of the characters I care about.\\" That's true. Throughout the series Martin has slowly been weeding in less likable, less compelling perspective characters that his story would probably be better off without. With all the characters you like dead, excluded, or mostly excluded. This is their show. However, while this is a problem, it is not the MAIN problem.<br /><br />The MAIN problem with A Feast for Crows lies within a blatant disregard of the most basic tenet of storytelling: there is no primary conflict.<br /><br />Instead, what we have in this novel represents, for lack of a better term, a bunch of emotionally fractured individuals participating in an even more fractured storyline. We get every single hateful detail of what Cersei is doing with her power, but it never goes anywhere. We learn about what Jaime is doing, and Brienne, and others who probably should have just stuck with supporting roles, but the plotlines of these familiar characters again, never go anywhere. The only people who actually do anything that contributes to the plot are a substantial number of characters we've never heard of, among them a group of people representing a new faction that, after reading this book and the one after it, I'm STILL not sure how I'm supposed to feel about.<br /><br />Basically, Martin's plot collapsed. Somehow in the seven year delay between the last book and this one, it exploded, and the barely substantial fragments have been put together to create this.<br /><br />The most tragic thing is that within this book there are echoes, things that remind you of what a good writer Martin actually is. For about two or three pages, you may actually start to enjoy it. But before you can, it returns to the usual drudgery.<br /><br />And how long is this mess? Almost a thousand pages. Longer than the brilliant first book. Longer than the still brilliant second book. And with almost none of the characters that were featured in them.<br /><br />Because of this book, I don't recommend Song of Ice and Fire to people. If I had known about this book, I wouldn't have started reading the series. Even after the superior fifth book, I still find myself going back and wondering whether it was worth it to finish this trash.<br /><br />If this was not in the same series as Game of Thrones, it wouldn't be publishable quality.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|the writers are doing an excellent job, as usual. i'm not ordinarily a zombie kinda guy, but this show has a compelling script and realistic characters, it's hard not to get sucked in. Season 3 has just begun, and I'm looking forward to the next episode.

B0041KVW2K|1.0|The first set that I ordered had a horribly defective pressing of Abbey Road.  Bad distortion and completely unlistenable.  Thus Amazon sent me another box.  However they shipped it in too big of a box so it ended up getting damage.  I pulled out only Abbey Road.  Better but still had some serious no fill issues.  Now what?  I have two boxes, one of them is damaged and so far no quality pressing of Abbey Road?  The albums in the set that sound good, sound really good, but this is just shabby production all the way around.  Furthermore, Amazon is great with the timing of a replacement but they didn't pack it properly so it's damaged.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have always found his books to be a tick above the normal court/thriller books that I occasionally read.  This one however never really grabbed me.  Couldn't get interested in the protagonist or any of the other characters.  The story was also quite absurd and lacking any real adventure/action.  Sorry John......Had I started reading this and it was another authors work, I would have thought.....well, this guy could take a few lessons from Grisham on story line and plot development.  With the name Racketeer I was expecting a wild mafia/lawyer/court drama.  This book was anything but that.  Anyone is entitled to an off day or an off book I guess.  Just my opinion.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Very fun version of Breakout.  I like the addition of game-altering actions hidden within the blocks.  Just one suggestion and one &quot;bug&quot;. The suggestion would be to continue on the board the player ended with rather than having to restart the entire level. And the bug is when I want to end the game, I press the back button. It takes me back a screen with a menu (Pause/Continue/Menu) for only a second and then backs out of the game.  I never get to select anything on the menu.

B006YXTRHY|5.0|I have already seen this movie, but I rented it so that I could revisit it before going to see Breaking Dawn - Part 2... after all it has been a year since it came out!  Still loved the movie.  I liked the whole series because they stayed with the book, unlike a lot of other movies that don't stay with what is in the book.  If you are a Twilight fan, you will love this movie!  Just be sure that you watch the others first, starting at the beginning.
0553240633|5.0|Wolfe's novelized account of the early days of NASA and Project Mercury is amazing, not just for the breadth of its scope, but for the larger-than-life way he portrays the astronauts, test pilots, and other personalities involved.  Wolfe does a spectacular job of capturing the peculiar mindset that compelled men to volunteer - willingly! - to climb aboard an unreliable rocket and cross their fingers.  There's a great mix of human drama and technical detail, international politics and individual rivalries, not to mention a lot of humor.  It's definitely worth a read for anyone interested in the space program or Cold War history.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was a great movie... at first found it sort of depressing but once I got into it, I throughly enjoyed it.  If you like this kind of movie, (English romance/life) you will love this movie!
0316017922|5.0|What does your birthday have to do with the likelihood of you striking it rich as a technology CEO?  Why do some very smart people succeed and other equally smart people fail?  Is there more to success than simply talent and hard work?  I don't want to say anything else lest I spoil Gladwell's carefully-researched answers, so I'll just say that you should read the book.  It's a good one.
0525958002|5.0|I thought this book was great because he reveals so much about him and his life without him being petty and a gossip. I couldn't put it down. Great pictures too!

If you've ever wondered that, &#34;Blink&#34; will sort you out.  Gladwell is an excellent writer, and the research that he puts into his examination of split-second decision-making will leave you astonished.  You'll be glad you read it.

0817439390|2.0|This book is full of informal 'tips' about this and that, but in the long run there's nothing different from other free online photography resources.<br />I agree with other negative reviews and want to add something: given that the focus is on 'stock photography' there's nothing inspiring here from an artistical point of view. You only see commercial looking pics like those you find in random brochures and flyers.<br />If you want to make photographs to keep for life, photographs that really worth something even (and specially) if you're not into professional art, go get something like Barnbaum's Art of Photography.

1936608618|5.0|I couldn't have been more pumped when I found Power Speed Endurance in my mailbox last week. I've quickly read thru the book front to back and would recommend it to all Endurance athletes, coaches and those in the Endurance community. Its for someone who is open to new perspective. In the past, I've struggled with Triathlon Training or Marathon Training type books because they sometimes take it over the top, get too wordy and are boring. One example of a book of that sort was the \\"Triathletes Bible\\" (I think there's like 20 editions now or something) Anyways, I found myself quite overwhelmed. Power Speed Endurance is a heck of a lot different. In a good way.<br /><br />Power Speed Endurance not only takes a completely different approach on Endurance training, but the books lays it out where it should flat out make sense to the every triathlete. The book is backed up by science and focuses on strength and conditioning as and the skill within the sports. CrossFit Endurance is sometimes quite difficult to explain to the typical Endurance athlete, but this book simplifies it. The book is setup focusing on all sections of SKILL which include running, cycling, swimming, strength and conditioning and mobility. The mobility section is gold. I think it will blow the minds of people who aren't currently using bands, lacrosse balls or PVC rollers. Most athletes.<br /><br />What I like most is now I have a tangible resource for training. I've gathered new ideas for team workouts and for my personal triathlon training. I didn't have a huge knowledge of swim technique, but Chris Michelmore's description in the book helps a ton. How can you argue with a book that within each section has an expert leading the discussion? This is a MUST for any Endurance coach because the case studies will help reinforce target training with your athletes.<br /><br />That said, it's time for you to pull the trigger on a purchase. The pictures, descriptions of skill, drills, workouts and informationprovided is absolutely invaluable.

B001DCQI8W|4.0|Bruckner is a unique composer. The symphonies exist in several versions, often quite different and the interpretations of the same version also very different. Listeners' moods often dictate which version/interpretation thet want to hear at any point in time.<br />I have  both Jochum sets, all Karajan performances, some Haitink , all Wand, all Boehm ,a  few Frankfurt Inbal and Tintner rarities and some others like Solti,Maazel,Klemperer,Sinopoli.<br /><br />I listen to Karajan when I want a smooth, perfect performance with great pianissimos. In the case of the 3rd and 5th Karajan's are probably also the best overall for the versions he does.<br /><br />compared to the vinyls these Karajan 1970's recordings on CD have a bit more bass and sharper dynamic contrast but still lack weight compared to Wand's Berlin Phiharmonic live  RCA versions (which don't have the dynamic contrast.<br /><br />for overall punch I prefer the Jochum Dresden, especially in their Brilliant records release..
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read the reviews before buying. I sure wish I had. It is a thorough waste of time. I thought that perhaps a plot or story line would develop but it never did. At the end, it just ended. I considered buying the next book as I wondered surely there must be more to this. But on reading the reviews I found out everything that happened without wasting more time and money on it. As the other reviews state, it is repetitious, boring, ridiculous and degrading to women.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|After listening to Sunken Condos, the second line of \\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\" really stands out.  Fagen sings, \\"I'm evolving at an astounding rate of speed...\\"  As enjoyable as Donald Fagen's music is, there is not much that one could describe as evolved on this recording.  Outside of the cover of Issac Hayes's \\"Out of the Ghetto\\" there really isn't a new idea presented.  Echoes of his Nightfly trilogy abound as he continues his vignettes of nostalgia and lost youth using very familiar instrumentation, chords, and moods.  To be certain, anyone who enjoys Fagen's musis will not dislike Sunken Condos.  But one must wonder with the time Fagen takes between recordings if he has run out of new ideas.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|For a movie that got so much negative press and horrible reviews, I quite enjoyed watching it! Admittedly, the plot and dialogue are formulaic and cheesy at times, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to entertain. The CGI is truly terrific here and you won't be disappointed if you're looking for a movie that will allow you to shut your brain off for a couple of hours.

B0072OFM28|5.0|I found this season of Spartacus Vengeance fascinating for these reasons: very strong performances from all the cast members who are great actors in their own right. I very much loved Andy Whitfield and was so hurt and disappointed when he died. I had serious doubts about whether any further episodes would be able to hold my attention. I was thankfully wrong. Liam Mcintyre is not Andy but I feel he did this job to the best of his ability. He had a very heavy burden to carry. I feel the entire cast gave performances worthy of Oscar nominations. I'm trying to figure out how the writers are going to top this season in what is supposed to be the last with season 3. I look forward to War of the Damned. I recommend adding this DVD to your Spartacus collection.
B00004R99L|3.0|Alice In Wonderland in one hour and fifteen minutes and was released in theaters on July 26, 1951. Basically Alice sees a white rabbit running in the field and gives chase. She falls downs a rabbit hole and arrives at a wonderland. There Alice meet the White Rabbit, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum & Tweedledee, and the Cheshire Cat and has the adventure of a lifetime. That is the movie in a nutshell. This is one of the rare Disney movies that I find hard to follow and have even a harder time making sense. When Alice In Wonderland first came out in theaters it was booed by the critics, but have since then found a cult following.

B005FISBTO|4.0|Reading some if the previous reviews, I too noticed that the disc was designed so you could not skip the promos which included material from Dexter that gave away the plot of a vital episode. Show Time may want to check this situation in the future since it takes away from the suspense of the series. I was puzzled that we didn't see as much attention paid to the relationships of some of the other characters. Overall, I found this season very interesting and always look forward to the issues facing our favorite serial killer, Dexter.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful movie about characters.  The plot is only of minor importance.  British cast is wonderful.  All are Oscar level performances.  Hope it is remembered at nomination time.

B0060DYMT6|5.0|I am not even exaggerating when I say this movie is my number one movie of all time. It has everything. The twist, the love, the hate, the brilliance, the emotional drama, the suffering, the sacrifice...everything blended in together to become the Prestige. I can't say how much I love this movie and how it has such an impact on my thinking and perspective everytime I watch it.
0739337270|5.0|No wonder this is ranked so high for young readers, but it is also a great book for adults.  It captures a tragic time from the eyes of the people who could do little or nothing to help, but did what they could and suffered because they could not do more.  Wonderfully written as well.  I recommend it very highly.
B0020M99LC|4.0|The plot is pretty brilliant and of course, Daniel Craig is amazing as Bond. But compare to the old ones I might have thought this one fell short a little bit. But overall I still like it. Good watch.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|It's one of those movies that doesn't come around very often, but when does, is something not everybody will get, or care for. Personally, for myself, it is hard hitting movie from directing, through musical score and cinematography, down to Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. This is the only movie I've seen from the director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson, but it only drives me to see all of his others. Something you should definitely try and get around to watching, especially if your a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis, as it is one of his best, if not the best, performance of his career thus far. Maybe not a movie one might not want to buy and own, but certainly give it a try.

159102594X|4.0|The Blade Itself is the first of The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie.  I appreciated Abercrombie's world building here, especially as it relates to the type of gritty, dark fantasy world that I like.  I would've appreciated a map in the book so I could really tell where all the different kingdoms were in relation to one another, but that's ok.  Abercrombie's characters here really shine, especially Logen Ninefingers and Inquisitor Glokta.  Yes, there are no real good guys here, but you begin to cheer for these imperfect characters anyway, as they strive along the plot in their own way.  I think the biggest detractor for this novel is that it feels like it's all setup for the rest of the trilogy - things happen, but it feels like all the important plot points are left for a later book.  I left this book thinking that if it were stand-alone it just wouldn't make sense at all - there's nothing resolved.  That said, I enjoyed this book thoroughly, especially Abercrombie's sense of language and his characterization, so I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy and finish the story.  Just don't expect *too* much to happen in this one.  A good start to what promises to be a great series, I think.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|I am very disappointed with this monitor.  Can't review other than it did not connect at all to my iPhone or iPad and was thus completely defective useless.  Sent it back.  A waste of time.
1469984202|5.0|Rarely does a story entice such emotion. An apocalyptic event results in survivors living a dystopian life, within a huge buried silo. Of course they're unaware that life can be any different as the silo is the only home generations of them have ever known. Still, some occasionally rebel against the system only to be defeated, and then sentenced to death, banished from the silo, into the unknown, outside, to die.<br /><br />Until one woman, Juliette, a mechanic who lives and works at the silo's lower areas, is promoted to sheriff and sent to the upper levels where she becomes curious of past unsolved deaths and begins to suspect the silo's hidden truths. Subsequently she is arrested, condemned and sent to die. Almost miraculously, she survives and fights back to right generations of wrong.<br /><br />I could not put this book down and regretted reaching its ending. \\"Wool, Omnibus\\" by Hugh Howey is an instant classic and does not fail to satisfy. The story is classic, the protagonist unforgettable, all the supporting characters are well developed and it'd be very difficult for the reader to not become immersed in the struggle. Best story I've read in a long while.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I actually had already seen this movie at a theatre, and knew after that I would have to have my own copy of it.<br />The actors they have chosen for this wonderful film are chosen wisely perfect in the characters they portray.  Maggie Smith, as usual, displays her usual professional wonderful acting abilities.  My first film I experienced Maggie in was The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and was so impressed, and I still am to this day.  Absolutely wonderful film.  I give it 5 stars!
B005LAII08|4.0|Brave is cute.  The story isn't new but pixar puts its own swing on it.  The 3D version translates well to big screen home TV.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is my first app review. Love the app. Great for anyone that enjoys puzzle games like routed or soduko. Love the range from easy to challengiñg puzzles. Have passed many hours with this app. Only drawback would be for those playing on a small screen can cause frustration when trying to select the correct square, but great on a tablet of any size.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I wanted to step up from the miserable, cheap quartz movement analog watches that I had bought previously. I have a friend who is pursuing watch repair and making as a career and he suggested this as a great entry level mechanical watch. The 7S26C 21 jewel movement is regarded as a workhorse, and for the past month this watch has kept time to the minute with my cell phone, which is as accurate as I can ask a watch to be. The caveat for this watch is that it is considered a smaller watch by today's standards. In the '50s and '60s men wore watches in this size, but now the fashion seems to be moving toward massive, chunky monstrosities. I prefer the smaller size, despite having large wrists. It is also not a watch you would want to submerge at all, and would want to be very careful around any running water under pressure. There are lots of 18mm watch bands to choose from on the aftermarket, and I think this watch is quite handsome on a brown leather band.

B005ETANC2|5.0|Great classic monster film! No CGI special effects, just good old fashioned special effects with REAL tarantula.  And learn a little bit about the desert.
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|If all you gain from reading this book is the knowledge that our brains can be changed through our own and others actions then it is worth reading. You will be entertained as well as educated.
B008RZF1UO|4.0|Having listened to Kamelot since 1999's The Fourth Legacy, I don't even think it is a debate among fans that Karma, Epica, & The Black Halo are the crowning jewels in the band's catalog and (whether fair or not) the measuring stick in which all subsequent releases are measured.  Silverthorn, Kamelot's 10th studio release & 1st album with Swedish vocalist Tommy Karevik, doesn't change this fact but I would be hard pressed for someone to argue it isn't the best thing the band has put out beyond those records.<br /><br />I think the rest of the reviews have done justice in curbing all fears regarding the departure of long time singer Roy Khan.  Khan was completely unique and one of the defining trademarks of this great band.  His voice will be missed but in no way does Kamelot miss a beat with Tommy at the helm.  I give a lot of credit to guitarist/founder Thomas Youngblood for having the confidence to allow Karevik freedom to create his own vocal melodies and tailor his approach to the music given him.  You can almost feel the sense of homage Tommy wanted to pay Roy on this record with some of his phrasing and pitch-perfect \\"Khan\\" notes.  Clearly he has very strong range and figures to flex his own trademarks on future albums.<br /><br />Musically the album is very inspired and the concept in which the music was built around is strong.  The single Sacrimony (Angel of Afterlife) is one of the best songs the band has ever written.  No doubt there are shades of the aforementioned Karma, Epica, & The Black Halo albums laced throughout this record.  But Silverthorn also has its own identity, the merits of which allow it to stand just fine on its own.  There really is not a weak track to be had when listened to as a whole, but broken away a small handful of tracks are exposed as filler (Silverthorn, Veritas, & Prodigal Son).  The remaining songs however play out as a never-before-released greatest hits album, any one of which could have been released as a single.<br /><br />This truly is a group effort in which everyone gets a chance to shine.  Youngblood & keyboardist Oliver Palotai have some of the best interplay of any Kamelot album to date, intermixing and crossing-up solos over the course of the album to breathe new life into an already familiar songwriting formula.  Drummer Casey Grillo remains one of most underrated in the business and bassist Sean Tibbetts may be the unsung story of Silverthorn, outputting some of the coolest subtleties you'll hear in a rhythm section.<br /><br />The biggest drawback here is the production.  Producer Sascha Paeth's resume speaks for itself and for the most part I love his talent as both a producer and musician.  Unfortunately the music here sounds very compressed and while there is a lot going on (music, vocals, choir & symphonic arrangements, etc), everyone's parts seem to get lost in the mix (Tommy's vocals not being more at the forefront, bass & drums getting stepped on by other pre-recorded elements, etc).  There is no question that sonically this finds the mark, but anyone who has heard Kamelot live will recognize and understand the music needs more room to breathe, as to not lose that raw element that carries over during their live performances.<br /><br />All said, this album is tops in a discography where you are comparing apples to oranges anyway.  While I was happy to see the band not go any further down the dark road their previous release Poetry for the Poisoned appeared to be heading, I also want the band to steer back towards some of the original power metal elements that put the band on the map to start with.  For new or veteran Kamelot followers alike, Silverthorn is one of the best you will hear this year and is highly recommended.

B009GEEMLY|3.0|This movie tries to use CGI and big names to draw crowds, however falls short of having a cohesive and intelligent plot.  Looks great but lacks substance.  Why Hawkeye or black widow are even in the movie is questionable.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I had been following the development of this movie since the original script, which I wish they would have implemented. But alas, it was still an amazing movie! I would put it in my top 5 :-)
B009AZZEU2|2.0|Wow what a disappointment! I'm surprised by all the great reviews. I was sure that these guys wouldn't just go through the motions on this reunion cd but to me that is what this feels like. Nothing really unique here it's not really bad it's just not interesting. I seem to be in the minority here but this just leaves me cold. So bummed...
0345803485|1.0|I know what all the hype says. Best book ever? I think not. Far from it, actually. I hated this book, and here's why:<br /><br />Christian Grey needs a good beating. Not the kind that he would enjoy. But the kind prison folks get when they've done something wrong. And not by a beautiful woman, but by a huge black dude named Bubba. He is a jerk and if he was a real person I would stab him in the eye with a dull pencil. I'm just sayin, he sucks.<br /><br />Ana, oh dear sweet Ana. Wake the hell up woman! You don't want to do all of these crazy things he is suggesting but yet you do because he's so hot and you need to feel wanted? Way to put women back a hundred years!<br /><br />There is no story line. The whole thing is based on this unsure of herself chick succumbing to this egotistical douchebag and doing whatever he wants of her. I'm not a fan of romance, but if I'm going to read something that has it, I want passion! I couldn't even get myself to finish this crap.<br /><br />In no way do I suggest that E.L. James sucks for writing it because honestly, I want to give her a high five because she's banking right now! But seriously, did everyone who loves these books live under a rock before now? I work at a book store so I see first hand the mania that is 50 Shades. 80 year old women are coming into my store asking for this because they heard about it at CHURCH! Uhm, gay marriage is frowned upon but you're telling 80 year old women to go out and get tied up and beaten for thrills?<br /><br />That's not to say I don't think grannies should be getting their groove on. More power to them actually! But this book is not the first of it's kind, and most definitely far from the best. This is not Erotica. If you want to see some real hot stuff, read Letters to Penthouse. I'm getting all hot and bothered just thinking about it.<br /><br />My point being is that this book came out of nowhere and took over the world, for what? For mommies to be abused by their men just to get their rocks off? No. I mean, I'm glad sex lives around the world are getting better ten fold and everything. But seriously people, the story is awful and the characters made me want to punch kittens. HOW is this a bestseller? And when will it all end...heir rocks off? No. I mean, I'm glad sex lives around the world are getting better ten fold and everything. But seriously people, the story is awful and the characters made me want to punch kittens. HOW is this a bestseller? And when will it all end...
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This album is astonishingly beautiful to listen to.  I am amazed by how good Susan Boyle's voice actually is now. I expected Michael Crawford's voice to be great, but who knew (I sure didn't!)that Donny Osmond has a great voice too?  Their three duets offer a pleasing contrast with Boyle's voice. Her seductive  rendering of The Music of the Night will surprise anyone who thinks of her as a prudish church lady. I am thrilled that Boyle chose Eva Cassidy's version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow instead of Garland's, although there is a risk that in its position as the lead track, people not familiar with this arrangement may be initially put off the album by it. She somehow makes it heart-breaking and triumphant at the same time. I loved Agneta's (ABBA)original recording of The Winner Takes It All, but Boyle's rendition is powerful and full of suppressed emotional pain.  Bring Him Home, Send In The Clowns, As Long As He Needs Me - so familiar yet so fresh here, each a polished gem, well-articulated and impressively sung. Out Here On My Own was one I didn't know before, but it is fast becoming a favorite.  Memory - I can't help it, but I get chills every time when she hits \\"touch me,\\" even though I know it's coming. She sings You'll Never Walk Alone more as the contemporary soccer club anthem it has become than as the old-lady tear-jerker from Carousel. The production values on this album are first rate as well - orchestral arrangements, sound quality, balance, track list, cohesion, album art - a magnificent musical achievement. Kudos to everyone involved.

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Like many Scott buffs, I remember ALIEN (1979) as being one of the defining films in the late twentieth century horror canon.  The blend of horror and science fiction, coupled with some genuinely memorable sequences (for example, involving John Hurt), have remained with me throughout my career as moviegoer and sometime critic.  Likewise BLADE RUNNER, in all its versions, has always struck me as a film that defined the canon of science fiction films.  Having sat through two hours of PROMETHEUS, which doesn't so much revisit ALIEN as reproduce in many cases precisely the same sequences contained in the earlier film, I really wondered why Scott bothered to make it at all.  Maybe he hoped to emulate what George Lucas had done with the STAR WARS canon, and produce three prequels to the original STAR WARS film; if that was the case, then I wish he wouldn't.  PROMETHEUS is resolutely un-entertaining by comparison with ALIEN; the performances are wooden, the technology nothing special; and the plot almost entirely copying the original ALIEN film. Very disappointing.
0312360258|5.0|Cover<br /><br />I like the way the symbols are part of the cover. It's a bit mysterious with only a portion of the woman's face. There isn't much going on but it's intriguing at the same time. And her eyes are beautiful!<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />Zoey is a pretty decent main character. She's a typical teenager going through a life altering situation and she kinda loses her head. But she makes up for it. I absolutely adore her gay friend! I hope there's a side story about him one day. The twins are pretty cool and entertaining. Erik gave me a creepy vibe at first but he might just turn out to be a decent character in the long run.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />This book was really easy to get through. The plot is engaging and the characters are fun. It was hard to pull myself away because I wanted to know what would happen next. It's a unique story of overcoming one of life's obstacles and I'm interested to see where the rest of the series will go.<br /><br />Quote(s)<br /><br />\\"Don't you think baby corns are scary?

0385737955|3.0|Another inspiree from the Hunger Games success puts out a fast-paced apocalyptic thriller.  Good things:  the author has mastered the art of the cliffhanger, and nearly every short chapter makes you want to keep reading.  Bad things:  Takes the basic concept behind the Hunger Games trilogy (children in danger as a result of societal decline) without the strength in characters or the relationships between them.  If you are totally into the whole futuristic dystopian teen thing, it's quite readable but otherwise feels like the less recommendable novel in the genre.
B00992CF6W|4.0|In Minecraft, you can build houses with unlimited resources, but there are no monsters in Creative Mode. Survival Mode is fun. You fight monsters and stuff,  but in both modes there are no caves. It's not worth the $7 price tag, but it's better than Block Story, where you can't do anything. You might want to wait for a price drop, but it's a great game. The graphics are bad.

The toy is not hard to use, some reviews claimed it only makes one sound with one pound and you have to turn it around to make a next sound when it fact It might take some effort but your baby has to pound it like he/she is really pounding something and the heads would go back and forth making funny noises  with just pounding on one side.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Got excited when i heard they were going to make this with a limited budget and more practical approach to the source material. Meaning it had to depend on plot and story, none of which is in short supply. This movie doesn't bullshit with lame one-liners and flashy costumes. It is a full on visceral attack on the senses, especially when submerging the viewer into the effects of \\"slo-mo.\\" I feel like people didnt want to give this movie a chance, which they should. If you're a fan of kick-ass action you really should give this a try. I can't wait for this movie to come out on dvd.
0007351054|2.0|Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.<br /><br />The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.<br /><br />I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that.inish it.

B000A88EVE|3.0|The Tevis novel came out just two years after Robert A. Heinlein won the Hugo Award for his iconic novel STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. The similarities are unavoidable and suspicious. Except that the Tevis protagonist 'humanoid alien' from a dying planet, RAH's Michael Valentine Smith, is actually a human boy raised by Martians who are dying. Both books address fish out of water observations about his new world (Earth), finding love and violent ignorance. Instead of becoming a corporate billionaire with the help of attorney Farnsworth, Heinlein's hero establishes a worldwide religion, with the help of attorney Jubal Harshaw. Both stories end up badly with human culture and Government as the enemy. Just thought Heinlein deserves some credit here. For a long time, I thought the film was actually loosely based on STRANGER, only to find RAH got nary a mention. Hollywood is overlooking a plethora of great original RAH SyFy material after mishandling STARSHIP TROOPERS.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie will bring you up and down the emotional ladder and keep you involved with the actors.  The best in the film is Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as Ruby Thewes.  She makes the movie and brings the two other actors together on film.  She is a great actress and has many entertaining roles in other movies.  I liked Jude Law and Kidman together but it lost a little something in the translation in the book which I read and compared to each other.  There needed to be more sparks between them.  Ruby certain stepped in and put that in the movie.  I loved Ruby's life style, her &#34;in your face&#34; manner, and I loved the ending.  It rang true to life.

Seems a little weird to rate MP3 downloads, since you should already know what you're buying. Amazon's cloud player coupled with download capability makes it a great place to shop.

B008H6GH8I|3.0|I really really love Animated films and I'm even going to college for this, so for me the CGI was amazing, however, not so much the actual animation as sometimes characters do the weirdest movements. It does not ruin the movie experience at any point but sometimes audio seems a bit off. The biggest issue that I have personally as far as character design is Ada Wong, I don't think anyone else will have a problem with this but Ada to me in this movie looks bad in terms of design. I really hated how dried her lips were and how her cheeks were a little bulky giving her more of an american look rather than asian look. I know she's just has a chinese decent but she didnt look chinese at all to me. Just saying...<br /><br />So the biggest problem that I think this movie has and as well as most Japanese Animated films is story line.. I guess the Animation must take up so much time they sacrifice story because just like Tekken, RE: Degeneration, and other ones.. The story lacks in so many ways and sometimes you cant really take anything serious. You cant really Compare them to Pixar/Disney, or Dreamworks as these films are more CGI heavy compared to the american comapanies. I love Japanese animation more for this but I am still waiting for that one movie to really blow my mind.<br /><br />This movie as an overall is okay for those Resident Evil fans and as well for those who just want entertainment..<br />Pretty good for those who love Animated films such as myself..<br />Terrible for those are looking for good quality films with amazing story line and amazing CGI

My only stipulation is that it is very hard to play on a phone, especially as you move to the upper levels with large grids. I can play easily on my tablet though, and these have become some of my favorite games.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|All i can say is wow. I did not expect what happened at the end of this book to have happened. Another great one by Sylvia Day but i feel like this book was shorter. But this cliffhanger thing is killing me and now i hear that the third book is pushed back all the way to next year. Man that is way too long. But anyways this book was great.
B001LX50I2|5.0|Nothing beats these actors at their skill in pulling off such a movie.  The book itself is worth reading and comparing to the movie.  The plot is intriguing and the suspense is better than most.  It is a movie to add to your entertainment collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, makes you think if this can really happen. If you haven't seen the movie read the book first. If you did read the book for more...Izzy
B005T5ODWW|5.0|I love the contrast between history and an exciting action storyline. I also enjoy the fact and fiction section guaranteed at the end of every story. True ly talented author.
B00914JWSW|3.0|I know these songs were picked because they were supposedly hidden away in some vault somewhere for umpteen years and were mysteriously found and now released on this album (hence the name &#34;Release Me). However, they certainly aren't up to the standard of other Babs albums. Maybe that's why they were never released. The voice is flawless (it's from when she was younger I think), the orchestration a bit overdone on some, and it is easy to listen to. But, something is missing. I just can't put my finger on it. Certainly worth buying if you want to be able to say you have all of the Streisand albums. Otherwise, don't knock yourself out; you're better off buying one of the old ones.
0684824906|1.0|Yes, it is an interesting perspective to look at Lincoln by describing his rivals.  All the more remarkable in that Lincoln used and fused them into a functioning unit.  This perspective could have been the road into a deeper analysis of Lincoln, but this is where the book falls flat. It is, in the end, just another whitewash of the past, and misses the deeper meaning.  To describe Lincoln's genius is fine, although a well-worn topic, but to get to the bottom of why he was able to act as he did is really the crux of the matter and of far more interest and relevance.<br />Lincoln was indeed depressed.  Many far more qualified than Goodwin to make that call have documented extensively the evidence.  Read \\"A First Rate Madness\\" if you want to learn about the fact of Lincoln's mental illness.  Suffice it to say here that Goodwin's assumption that Lincoln was not mentally ill is the wrong turn on the road to the more interesting understanding of the meaning of his life.<br />Lincoln was able to see and face the reality of situations far better than the rest of the \\"team of rivals\\". You know this when you compare the pompous, formal, and egotistical promenading of the others, who seem more rooted in some Roman past than in beginnings of the industrial revolution.  Lincoln was a modern man.  He was not under some delusional self-image of mythological proportions.  He was rumpled and real.<br />His depression, his mental illness, is the root of that ability to face reality.  As Nassir Ghaemi, a mood disorder expert, has said, the depressed are less prone to the delusions that homoclites entertain to comfort themselves.  The depressed are more empathetic, having suffered so deeply, and, above all, they are more realistic.  If he is right, than the most interesting questions about Lincoln can only be answered by understanding his illness, and avoiding that issue can only lead to superficiality and misunderstanding.<br />The bad assumption of Goodwin's, that Lincoln was not depressed, makes the book a shallow effort. No wonder that Spielberg used the book to make his movie.

B002LB7S10|5.0|The Last House on the Left is a very graphic and hard hitting story.  The director and actors are superb and the atmosphere the movie brings to the screen truly tells the incidents as they way they would have happened.  It is a strikingly different type of movie with real life scenes that set one to thinking about being anywhere in any house.
1609611543|5.0|Informative...well written...helps to speed up that decision to change your diet and eat healthier!  go gluten free and you will love the difference in your energy level alone!
B00008G8LY|5.0|James Cameron - Here's a director that never has disappointed me.  One particular part that makes this movie a must-have - I'd never seen anything so intense!  Great Movie!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I was so pleased to find spider as a droid app. I play it a lot on my PC.  The free app downloads and runs flawlessly on my kindle fire.
B0007SKF5K|5.0|Perfect for mounting my big D cell streamlight just inside the door of the RV.  Holds tight even on the bumpiest road.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|The 2nd in the series.  Ties in well and great historical info.  Learned a lot while having a good read
B001GCUO5M|5.0|This is a great movie with lots of weird happenings right from the start.  It can get you thinking and be confusing at the end when you really see the agenda behind the life of Teddy Daniels.  As always, DeCaprio is brillant.
B00280LYIC|5.0|while i was reading i could picture everything it was like watching a movie. i could not stop reading it.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|If you're a sucker like I am, for classic Sci-Fi, you must add this to your collection.  Just as I remembered it as a kid, and with today's sound systems, well, turn down the lights, and you're back in the huge theaters of the 50's and 60's!  Pass the buttered Popcorn!  Great price - arrived ahead of time, and all the extras that were included make this a valued part of my collection.  I must hand it to the production companies that do the work on the restoration of these classic gems.  SO MUCH WORK went into this movie.  $100,000 1952 dollars, for Robbie the Robot alone!  And it was interesting to find that the guy that created Robbie the Robot, also created the Robot for the Lost in Space TV series.  They even appeared in the same episode together!  How cool is that!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I finished this book in 3 days! I couldn't put it down. It was amazing and so addictive. Such a good book
B0092C2X7U|5.0|Its a great game, its fun to choose levels and jump on lunar jump. I highly reccomend this game, my friends and I  love it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable read. It's good to see the seasoned Rapp back in action. The story's pacing is good. Character chemistry is there. The action is well written and spot on. Flynn has done a masterful job of continually filling out the Rapp character and building a team around him.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|The Game of Shadows is very well plotted and directed.  The actors are picked with the idea of who works well together in such a teaming up of Sherlock and Dr. Watson in the true storytelling of the original writer.  The effects are very different and bring a twist to the movie itself.  It is a keeper and a movie to add to your collection.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|both my 12 year old son and i enjoyed this.  recommended for people who grew up in the 80s and videogame players.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|My introduction to Brendan Fraser way back when.  What a great DVD.  Had to own it!  Christopher Walken - brilliant!  LOL!  I remember those fall out shelters in Burbank, back then!  I knew one girl that lived in an apartment, and the apartment owner had buried a fall out shelter in the front lawn of the apartment!  LOL!
0606259090|5.0|It is one of those book that eveyone has read, but it is an easy read good to read on a plane or on the way to work.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|This movie was entertaining, but mostly just because of the actors being half naked the whole time. Otherwise, the story was sorta boring and predictable. A good girls night movie with major eye candy, but seriously lacking substance.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|This movie it's a moust have.<br /><br />I have seen it so many times and this blu-ray version is awesome<br /><br />Thanks a lot.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|A great movie and actors.  The director had it going on and went for the big one.  The effects are awesome and the ending always makes your want more.  Click on Amazon and order from the best.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The belief in reincarnation has always fascinated me.  This book was an interesting spin on this belief.  I would have given it a five but found the chapters that were written in a different \\"tongue\\", were a little difficult to get through.  Overall, the journey of the \\"Soul\\" was very interesting.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|The slick but lazy Tower Heist has a half-decent premise that's made to measure for these troubled times as the apartment building employees who have had their pensions and savings stolen by Alan Alda's Bernie Madoff-style Wall Street fraudster decide to steal their money back from his penthouse suite. Unfortunately the writers may have put in the foundations but didn't get round to furnishing the jokes or thrills a comedy heist movie needs, leaving the cast with surprisingly little to do as the film continually sets up would-be comic situations only to cut away to the next order of business before they have a chance to pay off. Even more unfortunately there's either no room or no incentive for them to improvise either, with Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick and Casey Affleck seemingly sticking to the unfunny script with dogged but unremarkable professionalism while director Brett Ratner, this millennium's Michael Winner, lazily treads water and brings nothing to the party like a man who wants to finish early every day and spend all the money he's making for this old rope. Things pick up slightly during the heist itself as they find themselves trying to smuggle their unexpectedly bulky loot out of the building but it's never more than watchable but completely forgettable even while you're watching it.<br /><br />Not much in the way of extras on the DVD - a few brief deleted scenes including an unconvincing alternate ending, gag reel and a self-congratulatory audio commentary - but after the film it's doubtful you'd want to spend any more time with it anyway. If you do, the Blu-ray typically offers rather more, including picture-in-picture featurettes, video diary and 45-minute making of.
B0063IH60K|5.0|keeps the mind occupied when waiting for unpunctual friends and colleagues its not too difficult to be frustration and not too easy to become boring.
1402270275|5.0|What an awesome debut.  Gorgeous blend of action and romance--with steampunk so subtly done, I was in the story 100% for the whole ride.  Not sure I can make it to next May for McMaster's next installment.

0767816641|5.0|Here is a very cute and endearing movie to lighten the day and get your love strings singing.  Madeline is always in trouble and is always in the face of her caregiver a Nun and her teacher, Miss Clavel.  It only takes one Madeline to get the girls into behavior unbecoming a a group of orphans.  It is a great gift and conversation started for all ages and totally disrupts the straight line marching expected of &#34;good little girls.&#34;

0790731940|5.0|Three great actors.  I loved the plot and this movie is worth a keep.  I love James Garner in anything he does, he brings such true acting to the table.  Jodie Foster does quite well in this role as a saloon girl and con woman, and of course, Mel Gibson is himself and he does cement this group of actors and their parts together.  A must see.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I was totally disappointed with this movie. Not at all how i thought it was gonna be. There wasn't much of a plot either.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|The DVD set was ordered on November 4 for 29.98, and I received it November 13. I check the webiste on November 18, and it is now 19.99. Stores in the real world will give you the sale price after the fact. Amazon, being an \\"industry leader\\", will not give the sale price. So now, I have to pay sales tax and Amazon will not follow generally accepted policies from real world stores. I think I have come to the point of no return for this online store. It has lost it's pricing edge, and it will only continue to go downhill from here.<br /><br />Homeland is a great show by the way.
B004R11XBS|5.0|I have enjoyed every movie I have seen Ms Hawkins in & this was no exception. Another fine performance recreating the struggle of women to achieve equal pay in the UK. The entire cast was fantastic with Bob Hoskins in a supporting role which he can do so well. If you're a fan of Ms Hawkins, this is a must see & if you are not familiar with her, this will be a fine introduction.
0553565915|1.0|I give this book to anyone who has lost a loved one- very inspirational on giving the grieving ones solice

B000J10EQU|5.0|Another great take on Superman!  The effects and actors are well done and the plot is entertaining.  The story line is the same but with Lex Luther being played by none other than Kevin Spacey lends it true credit to the world of Superman's revengeful con men.
B001P42Y2C|5.0|I LOVED this movie! It is an absolute must for Heath Ledger fans! A beautiful love story told in a beautiful way.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a since I've chosen to read a science fiction novel. This book has renewed my interest in the genre. Thank you for such a compelling read!
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is the first book I've ever read by J.K. Rowling. I know I'll get flack for that, but there it is. I love urban fantasy and paranormal romance and young adult books, but Harry Potter never appealed to me. Rowling has received so much ridicule for this book because it wasn't another Potter-like story, but I applaud her for stepping outside that world and doing something incredibly different. So many of my writer friends love to write and read in different genres. I love to write and read in different genres. And I think it was incredibly brave and had to be liberating to step into something new and, well, different.<br /><br />I admit the blurb did nothing for me when the book came out. It didn't peak my interest at all, but it was chosen for our book club, and I'm so glad that it was. I found the writing smooth and smart, the characters dynamic, and their situations raw and real. I grew up in a small town and I found it incredibly believable. I don't generally like books in third-person omniscient and the massive cast took a bit to get acquainted with, but the way Rowling wove the sub-plots together had me watching the clock until I could get back into their lives. There were a few scenes that were predictable, but overall I found the book to be authentic. Rowling dug into the worst of each of the characters and exposed that for the reader without leaving me feeling like she was biased in one way or another about the characters' justifications or motivations. There were circumstances and reasons why each characters was who they were. It was neither good nor bad, right nor wrong, it simply was. She showed how the \\"privileged\\" are just as troubled and twisted as those who are not, but did so without taking sides or glorifying or degrading one side over the other.<br /><br />And, above all, I loved the ending. Even though it was tragic and dark, there was a glimmer of hope for a few of the characters and that was just about perfect for me. I truly enjoyed this read and commend Rowling for writing it.d and commend Rowling for writing it.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|A wonderful creative movie.  My family loves it. It was a gift for my three year old and she couldn't have been happier.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|Dark Shadows has been around for a long time and has run many times on TV.  A series to contend with in the life of a vampire.  Depp, Pfeiffer, and Carter turn on the charm and magic to make this film a great keeper.
B009GEPPYC|3.0|If i'd have seen this movie before buying it i wouldn't have bought it. The best parts were the parts in which Russell Brand appeared.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Purchased this to replace the stock on my i7 2600k. I added a secondary fan for the full push and pull effect. Overclocked to 4ghz so far have not gone above ~53c under loads and stress tests. Usually at ~43C on idle. The only downfall that i could think of, that doesn't apply to my personal setup, would be the fans position over the RAM sticks. If you have RAM that has heat sinks that make it excessively taller than normal, you might have an issue with this fan sitting on top of them. My current mobo is the DP67BG3 and if I had for example, [[ASIN:B006EWUO22 Corsair Vengeance  16GB (2x8GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory (CMZ16GX3M2A1600C10)]] or anything like those, the fan would collide with the RAM in the 2 slots closest to the CPU and this heat sink/fan combo would not be a good option. Luckily I have 4 of the [[ASIN:B004DHNAGM PNY Optima 8 GB (2 x 4 GB) PC3-10666 1333MHz DDR3 Desktop DIMMs Memory Kit MD8192KD3-1333]] and the fan fits right on top of the RAM with no issue at all.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Was not sure what to expect with this book.  Being a fan of his other works I was prepared to be let down.  Meaning that often I find myself expecting a certain type of prose from an author and then bam a new series a new time frame and I discover only disappointment.<br /><br />Not so with Fall of the Giants.  The research he did is great and the amount of new information I learned from the first book in this trilogy is awesome.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves history and fiction.  Meld them together and you can have a great read.  This is a prime example.  Get it you will be pleased.
