She is just a marvelous expressive singer and I've missed new songs from her these past years. I can understand every word when Whitney sings. I just love to sing along with her, how she expresses each phrase. I listen over and over again to \\"I Look to You\\" but I am sure I will move on and do the same to other tracks once I figure out exactly how to sing along every note to this one. Yay for Whitney!

0452289963|5.0|I'd put this book in the category of eye-opening.  Though many (including him-self) may regard Mr. Tolle as a spiritual leader, I hold that title only for those that do NOT consider themselves such.  Still, this book offers much in the way of teaching.  Concepts are well thought out, delivered in a manner that is easy to understand if you have the inclination to open yourself to them, and fresh enough to keep my interest (and that is saying something).    Some people (a lot of people) could use the release found in this book.  It gives logic and reason to much of the spiritual teachings I've been under most all my life and allows the reader to find peace.  If the teachings are put to use, you can release your fears, your guilt, and find contentment in being.  I don't see myself as having attained the mastery that Mr. Tolle has but I am on the path.  I can tell.  I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining more of an understanding of who they really are.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I only just found out about Melody Gardot about a month. I came across her video for \\"Baby I'm a fool\\" one day on Youtube and I was truly blown away. I then bought this, her lastest cd, \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" and was impressed even further. Melody's voice is so smooth and so beautiful to listen to. I wished the cd would go on forever. Not only is her voice gorgeous but she also wrote or co-wrote all but one song on the album. Her song-writing abilities are fantastic and bring a lot of depth to the songs.<br /><br />My favorite tracks:<br />-Baby I'm a fool<br />-If the Stars Were Mine<br />-Your Heart is as Black as Night<br />-Lover Undercover<br />-Our Love is Easy<br />-Les Etoiles<br />-The Rain<br />-My One and Only Thrill<br />-Deep Within the Corners of My Mind<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this CD for anyone who has a love for the jazzier side of music. But you don't have to be a huge jazz fan to love this cd, I truly believe just about any music lover would enjoy hearing Melody Gardot sing.

B002FOQXZK|4.0|The landscape of popular rap music has changed. As reluctant as anyone may be these days to credit Kanye West with anything, his album 808s and Heartbreak has seemingly inspired a new generation of hip-hop musicians with that album's low-key, quasi-melodical synthesized feel. The most recent protegee being Kid Cudi, hailing from Cleveland with a style of originality which should, by now, feel familiar. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, because the latest mutation of the \\"future-core\\" of rap expands on the whole idea. While Jay-z recently appointed himself as the snazzy trend-setting leader of this new school with Blueprint 3, Cudi's envelope-pushing debut, Man on the Moon invents its own sort of stoner prog-rock sub genre.    Man on the Moon implicitly asks you from the very beginning to adorn your space-suit (or tie-die shirt) for an interstellar journey which most times sounds like a smoked out, chopped and screwed version of what 808s (which Cudi famously contributed to) could have been. Its concept is tied together as a 5 part epic narrated by Common, who is considerably (along with Andre 3000 of Outkast) one of the Godfathers of hip-hop's newly acknowledged free spirited style. The end result is perhaps the most potent of all the experimental-and perhaps evolutionary-jabs that have been taken at the idea of what rap music is supposed to be.    Before we completely praise this thing, there are a few missteps. The opener, \\"In My Dreams\\" certainly could have used a second take. \\"Up and Away,\\" the end-of-the-album alarm clock, might be a bit more saccarhine than most listeners will be in the mood for. \\"Enter Galactic,\\" produced by Mat Friedman of ILFONICS, should just be a fun Pharrell Williams meets The Jimi Hendrix Experience club track, yet suffers from awkward wanna-be sex-god lyrics such as \\"I like when you talk because your voice is angelesque/aye, I want to kiss you on your space/below your naval-ette/the place that you keep meat so moist like/a towelette\\" Aside from that though, Man on the Moon really soars. The track following \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life\\" has a bubbly, hypnotic beat which plays the perfect back-drop for Cudi's competently done sing-raps, and it's lethargically upbeat mellowness sets a tone for the remainder of the album which doesn't exhale until after the ultra-syrupy penultimate track, \\"Hyyerr,\\" is over.    Cudi's lyrics, while not exactly versatile, for the most part uniquely reflect the struggle of an alienated loner who secretly knows that he has something to share with the world, and is waiting for his chance to express it. The lead single, \\"Day N Nite\\", whose spacey thump was heard everywhere this year, to the point of being 2009's \\"Hey Ya,\\" laments on having a cold season of being lonely and misunderstood. \\"My World\\" is the musing of an artistic geek who knows that his off-kilter vision will take him places :\\"None of ya'll really cared about me/Now, guess what? I'm all you see/This will be my world/I told you so.\\"    Indeed, there are no guest appearances by Young Jeezy or T-Pain to extol the high-life or the thug mentality. Instead, this very impressive debut from the newest of the recent wave of space-rock hip-strappers, Kid Cudi, is a focused and personable work which is rife with themes of self-doubt and self-deprecation; yet just about every track on Moon gleams with crater-sized confidence in its ability to trip you out.    Grade: B
1416594787|4.0|Evolution is an inescapable fact, and we should celebrate its astonishing power, simplicity and beauty, as Richard Dawkins notes in this marvelously titled book, the latest addition to his already impressive list of books on evolution.<br /><br />Do we really need yet another \\"evidence for evolution\\" book? Well, yes we do. If only because of the alarmingly large number of educated people (especially in the United States) who hold virulent anti-evolution sentiments and prefer a supernatural, \\"intelligent design\\" explanation for the key questions in biology. But will the \\"history-deniers\\" read Dawkins? Leaving creationists and ID proponents aside, many people misunderstand evolution as a long chain of events that shape simple forms into more complex ones, rather than the branching and extinction of lineages. Therefore, open-minded readers should welcome yet another popular book on evolutionary biology, particularly if it has such a breadth and is so very well written as Dawkins'. As a teacher and communicator of science, Dawkins remains unsurpassed.<br /><br />The \\"Greatest Show on Earth\\" is an ambitiously large survey of evolutionary biology; more than 400 pages (plus many color photos) one long argument for why evolution is a firmly-based scientific explanation, a fact. Even for those who accept the evidence for evolution, Dawkins' book is a stimulating and refreshing read; not least because of its conversational yet authorative tone (although Dawkins can't help but to lash out at religion here and there, it certainly is not an anti-religion book like \\"The God Delusion\\"). As one reviewer noted: if Charles Darwin would want to know how his theory had fared in the 21th century, this is the book he should read. My own first recommendation, however, would be Jerry Coyne's [[ASIN:0670020532 Why Evolution Is True]]. The latter book is equally well written and informative, but more concise and focused. What's more, Coyne is less polemical than Dawkins (BTW, Dawkins praises Coyne's book in his first chapter).<br /><br />Dawkins covers the science in a rather standard fashion. The Gal&aacute;pagos islands, transitional fossils, embryology, artificial breeding, anatomy, etc., it's all there. Which is fine, of course. But those who are looking for a primer on the latest insights into evolutionary biology won't find it here. I would have liked to see more emphasis on the awesome power of molecular genetics in demonstrating evolution as an established fact. After all, the evidence in molecular biology is even more compelling than the fossil record (but, admittedly, more difficult to explain to lay persons). As an accompanying book, I would therefore recommend Sean Carroll's [[ASIN:0393330516 The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution]], which focuses on how DNA directs the evolutionary process.<br /><br />I'm puzzled why Dawkins chose not to mention the new insights into the molecular evolution of the eye. He discussed eye evolution at length in \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" - as did Darwin in \\"The Origin of Species\\" - and it remains a favorite topic of the ID crowd. But astounding genetic findings have revolutionized the eye evolution field: the animal eye, from fruitfly to man, was \\"invented\\" only once during evolution. Darwin would have been thrilled! Dawkins could have scored a strong point here. A missed opportunity.<br /><br />That being said, one can only hope that this book will convert at least some creationists and ID advocates; that the scales will fall from their religious eyes. But I have my doubts. To quote biologist Tom Tregenza: The fact that Darwin's theory makes so many predictions, none of which has ever been falsified, makes it easy to make a further prediction: it is only a matter of time before the ID proponents make it a fundamental tenet of their ideology that the pattern of life has been made that way specifically to fool biologists. In which case, evolutionists can take comfort in knowing that the creator specifically had THEM in mind at every step of the process.mind at every step of the process.

0385504225|2.0|Even good writers write bad books. Dan Brown's latest hyped novel, The Lost Symbol, is one. The story begins interestingly enough but as it slogs on it is soon secondary to a mish mash of esoteric stuff.   Brown's character, Robert Langdon, Harvard symbologist is called to give a lecture at the U. S. Capitol Building. His caller is (allegedly) an old friend and mentor who he hasn't had contact with in 10 years. When Langdon arrives at the venue, no one is there and no one knows about such a scheduled lecture.    At the same time a diminutive CIA operative pops on the scene. And yes there is an object with unknown symbols.    All this starts Langdon on a search for his friend, the meaning of the object and its symbols; all having to do with the Masons.   Okay so far.   But then it goes to pot in a short time.    Author Brown has done well with giving the reader a touch of the mystical and spooky symbolism in The Da Vinci Code, and he carries it into The Lost Symbol. Unfortunately he bogs down in all this to the point that you want to say, \\"Who cares?\\"   In this novel, Brown is like the guy who when asked the time tells you how to build a watch.    Meanwhile the story gets side tracked while we are pummeled with Masonic legend, lore, mysticism, truth, fiction ad nauseam. Add to this morass of information that isn't all that important to the story a tattooed murderous lunatic and you begin to wonder just what the story is about.   By mid book, you're completely lost as to what the story is because Brown drifts away from the original story line to impress us with his deep knowledge of Masonic history and symbolic meanings. It's as if he's writing a dissertation for his doctorate.    This reviewer also got lost in the erratic flashbacks and disjointed flow (if there was one) of the story.    Having been a Dan Brown fan from the beginning, The Lost Symbol accomplished one thing: It totally lost me in the quagmire of symbolism and boring information that had littleif any relation to the story.   All the hype, mystery and entertainment style promotion can't redeem the novel. Perhaps it was necessary to make up for its lack of quality.   I wouldn't recommend spending money for this book. Wait for it to come out on Cliffs Notes.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I am a huge Whitney Houston fan.  I have fond memories of listening to \\"How Will I Know\\" and the rest of her album on cassette tape over and over on my Walkman.  I was excited when I read about her long awaited comeback and rushed to buy her CD.  That said, I find myself fairly disappointed.  I realize that her voice has changed and it is no longer as powerful as it was 20 years ago, but I was unimpressed with many of the tracks on the CD.    I think this CD is a personal success for her, and for that I applaud her.  She's obviously had a lot to deal with in her life, and that is evident in the soulful, introspective and inspirational ballads \\"I Look To You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\".  But I found many of the ballads quite boring and lacking even a catchy melody.  The upbeat songs don't even come close to capturing the excitement and glory that was \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\", \\"I'm Every Woman\\" or \\"So Emotional\\".  Even with a more limited voice and range, it's like she was holding back and set the dial on 5 instead of going for 10.    I don't think this CD will recapture her commercial success.  Music has changed since the last time she was really on the scene, and this CD doesn't really offer anything for today's market.  Honestly, I don't see any of these songs as hits on the Top 40 radio stations.  If her name wasn't Whitney Houston, this album would be completely passed over as nothing special.    Nonetheless, I do cherish her music and would rather hear from her instead of many of today's dime a dozen singers who all sound the same.

B000EXDS5M|3.0|Chuck this up to one of those films I just `don't get', `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' is not a bad movie, but it deserves no where near the praise and prestige it has garnered.  The uneven quality of the production, as well as the redundancy of most of the scenes, leaves this one feeling incomplete overall.  The performances are decent (with one exception) and the pacing is steady (but nothing remarkable), but the actual scripting is where the film, for me, falls apart.  It comes off like a serious of similar situations and overly long extended sequences that needed major trimming, and some extra meat to make them even remotely necessary.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the Western to begin with, but I have come to appreciate the depth attributed to some of these films, especially in recent years (07's Jesse James epic was one of the most visually as well as mentally stimulating films I've ever seen), but this dusty film is just that; dusty.<br /><br />The film tells of Cassidy and Kid's turn from chasers to chased as a rival gang decides to hunt them down.  The film is really an endless chase scene that starts off rather exciting but descends into aggravating as nothing new is added to the pot.  They retreat to the hills, then to Bolivia, but even that is not far enough away to escape their enemies.  Between Cassidy's gung-ho optimism and Kid's meticulous realism, they make for a team to be recon with, but the film doesn't really make them out to be that smart.  You'd expect a lot more out of these two, and the script could have made for a more convincing comradeship; but it fails to do so.<br /><br />I loved the partnering of Redford and Newman in `The Sting' (which, unsurprisingly, was also directed by George Roy Hill), but here they don't have the chemistry needed to sell this.  I think that the script has to do with that, since they aren't really given anything interesting to work with, but I think that Redford and Newman's approach to their characters made it hard for the two of them to connect.  They are so different that they seem mismatched.  In `The Sting' they have similarly contrasting personalities, but the script is evenly balanced between the two characters and helps create a common ground between them; here though, there is just a sharp separation that makes them appear as if they were from two different films altogether.  Newman is effortless as the jovial leader; but Redford's nervous seriousness engulfs his scenes and makes Newman appear out of place.  They just don't really work here together.<br /><br />They are kind of uncomfortable.<br /><br />I also wasn't a fan of Hill's approach to this film.  `The Sting' had a layer of fun that permeated the film and made it seem exciting.  That fun though, NEVER took away from the tension he was building.  Here, Hill had a chance to create an intense film with layers of humor but instead he went with an awkward approach to his humor that resulted in awfully ridiculous sequences like that of Newman riding a bicycle while `Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' plays in the background.<br /><br />Bad move.<br /><br />I loved the opening of the film; the gritting sense of realism that was laced with an effortless humor that reflected the times perfectly; but once the sepia overtones were stripped from the film and the actual `movie' started it quickly descended into mediocre territory.<br /><br />I expected more from a film that ranks on AFI's `Top 100 Films of All Time'.two of them to connect.

From the Civil War to Vietnam in the 70's, James a.k.a. Logan (Huge Jackman) and his big brother nicknamed Sabretooth (Liv Schriber) have joined a secret government agency task force. But after killing innocent people in Nigeria, six years later he decides to make a better life in the Canadian rockies with a beautiful girlfriend Kayla(Lynn Collins) and with a job. However after Kayla was murdered, Logan particaptes in a experiment involving a rare indestructable metal called adamantium as it makes his skeleton and claws even more powerful then ever. He still retains his powers of immortality and self-healing as now he vows revenge on his brother and those that killed his true love, but it seems Stryker is kidnapping mutants and using them for experiments.

B0025KVLVA|3.0|ok, here is the deal, i just bought this (past masters) along with revolver today.  they are both the stereo versions of the 2009 remastered cds.  the new packaging is very nice, but now on to the review:  on the way home, i blasted it though my car speakers and i compared it to my ipod which has all the original cds loaded already at a high sample rate.  i was able to instantly compare the versions, and to tell the truth, they were VERY similar- not too much difference.  the new ones do have more bass , high end, and overall more depth and sparkle that jumps right out and you, and they are mastered louder for todays modern standards.   mccartneys vocal on 'let it be' is a bit fuller with more of a vinyl sounding depth and reverb,  but i found if i just selected bass boost on my ipod eq and cranked the volume i was able to come very close to matching the eq of the new cds.  at times it was very hard to tell the versions apart, which suprised me.   i then took it home, cranked it up on our loud 500 watt sony surround sound system, hooked the ipod up and again compared the versions, starting with 'taxman'.  again, not a lot of difference like i expected.  our system tends to pump out the bass anyway on high quality sampled bit rate songs on ipods, and since it has a subwoofer, it really tends to modernize and brighten up any song and really make it rock.   so, in the long run i was a little disspointed and im not sure if ill bother to buy the rest of the beatles catalogue.  we had bought the old cd boxed set in 1990, and i think they were the 2nd run enhanced versions, and they actually sound great, esp imported on my ipod using apples aac encoder at 192 or 256.   so the bottome line is, im happy with my old cds, and unless my wife buys me the rest of the new remasters for christmas, i doubt i will buy any more, as i just didnt notice that big of a difference in sound quality to justify buying all the albums over again.  thats just my opinion for whatever its worth.jk

However, I fairly quickly became bothered by all the coincidences--time after time seemingly unrelated people just happen to show up at the same place at the same time. And, yes, they all play a part in the story but not a part that would have drawn them physically together.  Overuse of coincidences strikes me as lazy writing. But this flaw in no way prepared me for the totally implausible way the book ended. For those who haven't yet slogged through the book's 500+ pages, I won't mention the details.

B000H7JCG4|4.0|I JUST STARTED WATCHING THE SHOW ABOUT 2 MTHS. AGO SO I PROB. WOULD'NT SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THIS DVD SET. WHAT I DID NOTICE IS THE CHANGE IN THE MUSIC. IT MOST LIKELY WOULDN'T PLEASE A LONG TIME FAN, BUT IT TRY NOT TO PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO IT, I STILL ENJOY THIS WONDERFUL SHOW!!!!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is magical. The dialogue is perfect and sounds like someone reading a book aloud. It certainly has a romantic element though it is not trite or overly sentimental and quite original. I would definitely say it is a must watch for anyone who enjoys good movies &/or a good book!
B000687M48|5.0|I purchased this becasue it is the live concert on cd that i can listen to anytime as well as the dvd.  I liked the DVD.  The extra behind the scenes are also a nice bonus.  I think it was worth the money and you get some \\"new\\" (actually old) songs.  A true fan will be sure to own this combo set.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this show and I am a Universtity Grad with a BS in Business Administration, not science.  Of course I did well in high school science so I sort of get where they are going but for the most part this is about lovable social outcasts of high intelligence & all the star trek, comics, social phobias that go along with it.  I do of course enjoy star trek, sci fi and read enough comics to be able to identify what the T-shirts represent (though I am more of a Marvel fan and they seem to favor DC).  Monday nights of Big Bang and How I Met your Monther on this channel is just perfect.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Really, liked the video. It was a major challenge at first. However, hurt my knee from doing all of the jumping jacks. this video is high impact and I would not recommend it for anyone with any past knee injuries. Jillian is a great trainer and does not make you feel stupid, as some do. The workout was great, but annoying that you can't fast forward straight to the video, it makes you watch some ads.
0810994739|5.0|get a Wimpy Kid book.  I was traveling out of town on business and stopped by the bookstore.  My kids expect something, I enjoy getting them something, but I don't like buying crappy toys.    I saw a table set up with these books and liked the look of it.  So I bought one for my [...]son and the three \\"Cloudy With A Chance for Meetballs\\" books (awesome in 3-D BTW).    Both my boys knew who the Wimpy Kid was because they play on [...] A LOT.  I thought I was moderating their computer usage pretty good, but it didn't click with me.    Anyway, he LOVES this book.  He is always giving it to me - \\"read this page mom\\".  I am hard pressed to stop at just the \\"one page\\" but he wants the book back.    It is hard getting kids to read so I am all for any book that my son wants to read - even better that there are several books so he can continue!
B0000541AM|5.0|Ordered the movie and it came when they said and how they said in perfect condition... definitely would order from them again....
0141182865|5.0|I belong to a book club and never would have selected this to read.  It was one of the picks for the club - I'm so glad I read it - it was full of humor and the author had a way of really making the characters get to you.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I loved this season. They brought back Lana only to send her away AND make sure that she wasn't able to be a love interest for Clark. Also they started with the whole Lois and Clark romance. I was really sad about the character who was killed off at the very end of the season.
B0016PM722|5.0|Many of you must have already read all the reviews I just wanted to add my 10 cents of what I believe would be a great Marketing Plot for Lucas Arts.  They should have an ELITE EDITION of the New StarWars OLD REPUBLIC GAME coming out 2010 and charge $150.00 and have it include this LighSaber with the Elite Edition Similar to MODERN WARFARE 2 having an Elite Edition which Includes NIGHT VISION GOGGLES!!!!  Just a Thought Pass it ON!
0385504225|3.0|this book is average at best.  I am a big Dan brown fan but the book seems rushed, like he was trying to finish it to fast and didn't put as much research/facts into as his others.  If your a fan then check it out.  if not ehh check it out from the library....
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I was waiting anxiously to get my hand on this book on the night of 15th , I pre-ordered it on Kindle and sure enough it arrive promptly at 00:01 AM , I was very pleased with Amazon Kindle delivery but that was only thing good about this book. This is nothing but a re-hash of \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"Da Vinci Code\\"  plus whole bunch of nonsense, third time around Roberts comes across as a pretentious teacher and symbols and clues feel like made up , book labor through 500+ pages just to end with a complete dud . I would like to write more but I don't want to spoil it for anyone though I wish someone spoiled it for me before I wasted my 10 dollars and time on this.
B0021L9MJG|3.0|Simply put, Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves. A classic horror film like Creepshow sees the glory of Blu ray, but the package is awful! A trailer. Is that all you could come up with? Or is is all you cared to put into it? The 2-disc European DVD is fantastic, and beats this minimal effort blu ray in all but picture.
0823015017|5.0|I have learned so much about color, hues and the ability to combine them into pleasing designs. I love the color graduated necklace using a skinner blend cane. The author's website also has mini lessons to go with the different sections of the book to help learn more about color, polymer clay and using the tutorials in the book.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|A hard film to categorize yet with an extraordinary appeal.  Captivating throughout with occasional dark humor.  Well acted with a superb script, unlike any other.<br /><br />Remarkable as the medium cannot convey the sensory dynamic, yet it is successfully communicated.  The story evolves into Platonic fable:  beauty can be pursued, never captured.  Philosophical underpinnings really drive the drama.<br /><br />The conclusion is operatic in the best sense.  A film to revisit.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Being unfamiliar with the graphic novels, anime, or video games that have made the Dragonball saga a world-wide sensation, I viewed \\"Dragonball: Evolution\\" with an open mind, hoping to see the kind of frenetic martial arts, magic, and humor I had enjoyed in \\"Mortal Kombat\\", a few years back. Well...\\"Mortal Kombat\\" this ain't, and despite the presence of legendary \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" star, Chow Yun-Fat (who must have needed the paycheck), I can't recommend this turkey to anyone over the age of 4!<br /><br />The plot is confusing; thousands (or 2,000) years ago, an insane demon lord, Piccolo (if somebody named me that, I'd be pretty mad, too), and his evil right-hand demon, Ozaru, nearly destroyed the world, until he was bound within the earth by seven sorcerors who gave their lives creating the mystical Dragonball orbs that focused their energies. Now, with a 'blood moon' total solar eclipse approaching, Piccolo (an unrecognizable James Marsters) is somehow free (how he accomplished that isn't explained), and gathering up the Dragonballs (which, together, according to legend, will allow the possessor the fulfillment of one 'perfect' wish). He plans to use it to release Ozaru, and finish what he started, before (uh, if any wish would be granted, why not simply WISH the job to be finished?)<br /><br />Meanwhile, in true \\"Karate Kid\\" fashion, young Goku (Justin Chatwin) is being trained by his Asian grandfather (Randall Duk Kim) martial arts, and harnassing The Force (oops, I mean, his Ki). Goku's past is unknown to him (to be revealed on his 18th birthday), and to celebrate the birthday, Grandpa gives him a Dragonball (which flashes images of Ozaru to him). Of course, Goku cannot display his formidable skills to his high school classmates (even the hot Asian girl he secretly likes, Chi Chi, played by pretty Jamie Chung). With the violent death of the old man, Goku learns of Piccolo's quest, and races to gather all the Dragonballs, himself, joined by greedy Bulma (Emmy Rossum, who must have needed the paycheck, also), a thief, Yamcha (Joon Park), and happy-go-lucky Master, Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat). The story goes downhill, from here...First the Dragonballs are all-important, then they're not, then Chi Chi is revealed as a martial arts expert, who isn't very formidible, then (with very unimpressive CGI), Goku's 'secret' is revealed, but it turns out IT isn't that essential, anyway. The story keeps building to less-than-overwhelming climaxes, with a finale that had me wondering why I'd stuck with the film so long!<br /><br />The Special Features are so-so (the gag reel is funny, an interview with Justin Chatwin doesn't really provide much more insight than a Google search, and a 'Making of' featurette of the Chi Chi vs. Chi Chi fight scene is informative, although the scene isn't the lynchpin of the movie that it is implied as).<br /><br />\\"Dragonball: Evolution\\" is a poor movie...skip it, you won't be missing anything!sum, who must have needed the paycheck, also), a thief, Yamcha (Joon Park), and happy-go-lucky Master, Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat).

B002GZQY6Q|3.0|It's really not that great - compared to their last 5 studio albums. Maybe I need to listen to it some more, but the songs (and the filler bits between songs) are not as complex or played as well, or have the unique melodies of their other albums.     I would say this album is a lot like Signify, and I like it as much as Signify and Sky Moves Sideways. As was pointed out in a comment to my review, it doesn't sound like Sky moves sidesways, but it's a lot like it to me - something you put on while you are reading or doing something else.  An album that is played but not something you need to concentrate on because there isn't much happening at any given point.    It's not much of a concept album, for sure, and not even close to the quality, detail, and sonic depth of In Absentia or Deadwing, or even Fear of a Blank Planet has better songs on it. I would say every album since Signify is better than this new one, including Lightbulb sun. Wilson much be stretched too thin with all his other projects. Not enough time was put into this one, I think. The songs aren't as complex and multi-layered.  It's almost like they made the studio songs easy to play live - and that's not right.  Put the best effort into the studio record and make it awasome, then worry about how to play it live.    Of course, this is just my opinion. From the raving 5-star user reviews, it has it's fans, it seems.   I'm still glad I got it - There are bits that are very good, but overall, it's just OK and already wearing thin with me.  I'll probably skip the 5.1 version.  Glad I only paid $9.99!

0061719544|5.0|The idea of a little boy growing up far across an ocean and eyeing the gleaming shores of this country has been tarnished of late by our misadventures as a superpower.  And now, suddenly and with the power that only a good writer can summon, it's back.    Odd, isn't it, that America never looks so good as through the eyes of someone who wasn't born into the privilege of this particular Democracy?    I read this book in a single sitting; starting the journey with a host who escorts us as easily through his life as he does through an hour of television every night.  From the mean streets of a mean childhood, to the gilded halls of Washington, and through the backdoor that led him to television stardom ... with a long and poignant stopover in the haze of alcoholism. What an adventure!  If you don't empathize with the man when he shakes his fist at the stars in the middle of the desert and chooses uncertainty just for the hell of it, you're not living right.    WIth the gentle hindsight of a man who has come out the other side of that haze, Ferguson is kind to virtually all the people in this adventure ... and Lord knows, it's uncommon enough for someone who makes their living in Hollywood to act that way.      This is a terrific read.  Enjoy it.
B002LII6PK|5.0|In \\"Batman Begins,\\" Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.<br /><br />That moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing \\"Dark Knight,\\" which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. Nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for Gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against Scarecrow and some Batman impersonators.<br /><br />So unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. He starts blackmailing Batman by killing Gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until Batman turns himself in.<br /><br />But even when captured, the Joker has an ace up his sleep -- Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives. And after a devastating loss, Batman finds himself dealing with the Joker taking all of Gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured Dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. Only Batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the Dark Knight forever.<br /><br />Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in \\"The Dark Knight\\" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.<br /><br />And Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking Batpod and the tanklike Batmobile. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (\\"That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people\\",\\" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.<br /><br />This is especially true whenever the Joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. And Nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on Batman. His direction is painfully delicate as he explores Wayne's sorrow and guilt.<br /><br />But the most striking aspect of \\"The Dark Knight\\" is Nolan's delvings into morality -- The Joker has none and Dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. It's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being TOO overwhelmingly dark.<br /><br />Christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding. And he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose Batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.<br /><br />On the flipside, the late Heath Ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign Joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could. He's pretty spine-chilling, actually -- the Joker is a true \\"agent of chaos,\\" whose intent is to seize Gotham, and corrupt Batman's soul along the way. There's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast-- Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece. Utterly astounding -- and promises better yet to come.orribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.     \\"The Dark Knight\\" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece.

0385504225|5.0|Not sure if I liked this book so much because it takes place in a city I know well, or just because Dan Brown is the only author I know who uses so many real-life landmarks and scientific facts that educate and entertain the reader at the same time.    The book includes many, many, references to Washington DC that may not be appreciated by someone who does not know the city, but for me, it made me swell with pride to hear about many of the places I know so well.  Whenever DC comes into contact with hollywood, there seems to be a disconnect, as if the city is too serious of a place to provide any entertainment value.  However, for this book, it is a perfect match.  Dan Brown is exploring much in the book regarding science, religion, faith, and human thought, i.e. serious topics, and so the personality of DC is well matched for the themes he discusses.      Overall, the book was extremely entertaining for me, and I can't wait to re-visit all of the landmarks he cites, although in the new light I will see them, it will probably be like looking at them for the very first time.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I bought this pool for my daughter's 1st birthday party and was very pleased with it.  The kids at the party had a blast playing in the pool.  I especially liked how it came with several toys to add more interest and fun to the pool. However, we had a time getting it inflated, so make sure you have the right type of pump and attachment.  Overall, I would highly recommend this pool for young children.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While entertaining, this story didn't seem as compelling as A&D or even DVC. The sidebar storytelling/history lessons seemed to drag on needlessly.  Even though this was part fiction, part factual-based with conspiracy theory twists, Dan Brown seemed to have \\"sold out\\" a bit in making this a \\"for movie\\" type of book.  This story didn't seem to have much substance and suspense timing (as in his the two previous Langdon adventures); it felt rushed ... as if he was forced to put something down on paper to conclude a thought or scene.    It also seemed that Dan Brown was either trying to appease the Church or putting just enough out there only to end his point with a contraction.      Without giving away too much in the story, when the story really got going, there was a very unbelievable part on their way to Mal'kah's house ...    Overall, a decent read.  If you've read the other two Langdon books, ya' have to give this one a try.    p.s., props to iphone & tweets were interesting too.    p.p.s, I didn't understand why the Author/Publisher chose NOT to support the Kindle's Text-to-Speech capability. Although, it did appear that the pictures were the same as the printed copy.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|First of all this is my all time favorite movie. Prior to ordering this bluray version I've watched the dvd I have probably 15 times. But, the bluray is so stunning that I look at it as an entirely new movie. It is so clear that you can see the pores on the faces of all the actors. This sounds like a \\"yuk\\" thing, but, believe me, if the pores are so outstanding everything else is even more amazing.    Now the bad news: it may just be this disk, but the \\"In Movie Experience\\" i.e. the commentaries reset to play automatically each time I stop or eject the movie. When reviewing the location in Special Features to turn it \\"Off\\", it already says \\"Off\\" but plays anyway. The only way I found to stop it is to turn it \\"On\\" then go back and turn it \\"Off\\". This only works for this one time I'm playing, but, as before it comes back by itself even though it still says \\"Off\\". I'm trying to get the disk exchanged, but it's only been two days since I submitted my request. I am surprised I haven't even received an email response, however.

0385342020|5.0|Lara Lington is in something of a pickle--her boyfriend has dropped her, saying he doesn't love her anymore, and her supposedly best friend and business partner has taken off for Goa of all places, leaving Lara broken-hearted and her floundering company facing bankruptcy.<br /><br />She attends her great-aunt Sadie's funeral--Sadie lived to be 105--more out of duty than anything else--but once there gets the surprise of her life. Without warning, she hears a voice in her ear and Sadie's ghost suddenly appears before her startled eyes. Of course no one can see this apparition but Lara and Sadie is no longer 105, but a lively, feisty girl in her twenties. This is the beginning of a delightful romp as Sadie, who was once the great love of a world-renowned painter, takes Lara's life into her hands while charging her with a mission--to find her long lost necklace. The two don't always get along and Lara finds Sadie quite bossy and opinionated, but with Sadie's help her career is given a new boost, her \\"perfect\\" man turns out to be someone entirely different, and family secrets are revealed and turned upside down. Along the way this very modern miss and her twenties counterpart, dance the Charleston, have fun dressing up in the flapper styles of the period, and discover the lasting bonds of friendship and family love. A fun read.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|Many of these comments for \\"The Final Cut\\" sound like apologies to me, their writers obviously aware of the album's inferior reception following the blockbuster \\"Wall\\". I hold this inferior opinion doubly, as I felt that \\"The Wall\\" was itself an inferior musical statement to \\"Animals\\". \\"The Wall\\", to me, is a detour, a sideways swipe at social norms that \\"Animals\\" had already attacked more directly and musically. \\"The Wall\\" retreated to grand theatrics and literal exposition to advance its ideas whereas \\"Animals\\" relied much more so on the abstract quality and tone of its compositions. \\"Animals\\" is more musical, much more compelling, haunting. \\"The Final Cut\\" follows \\"The Wall\\" in its expressionistic, personal style, but without the extreme theatrics. Its more modest production leaves it feeling very sparse at times. I assume it's intended to be more intimate, but oddly, without the overblown theatrics of \\"The Wall\\" to buoy the more somber, dour moments, it too often comes off leaden and plodding.<br /><br />Water's aim is to express disgust and contempt for the post war powers that be, but a mood of resignation and depression dominates, overwhelming any sense of burning anger. While the themes of \\"The Final Cut\\" are certainly dense and heavy, I found the tone and effect more suited to even more bleak, morbid subjects, such as \\"All is Vanity\\", or \\"Futility Rules All\\". These nihilistic themes are not the subject of the album, and so \\"The Final Cut\\" is even sadder than Roger Waters wants it to be.<br /><br />I liked it enough to buy it when it first came out and still listen to it 'cause some of it, a lot of it, is just brilliant, especially Gilmour's solos. I wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars to be precise, but 4 stars would be pushing it. Also, even tho it's entirely a Waters idea, it's still a Pink Floyd sound. And that's good.
B0025T65GC|5.0|This album is one in four that the maniacal, insane genius that is Devin Townsend will release under the Devin Townsend Projects moniker(The second, Addicted, is planned to be released in late October/early November). It is an immaculate first entry in the sense that it captures the extreme metal nature of his previous work under Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band as well as his fascination with older music.     Ki contains moments of dark bluesy acoustic that build and segue into even darker explosive moments. With brass instruments in Heaven Send, Che Aimee's backing vocals in several tracks and the partial seriousness of the lyrics, Ki is a work both typical of Townsend and, at the same time, open to new listeners. The notorious cursing of SYL is toned down to the occasional damn throughout a couple songs, but still to the same effect that fans are accustomed to.    My personal favorites on this album are Gato, Heaven Send, Ki and Disrputr and they, above the other tracks, illustrate the intense, cosmic buildup that Mr. Townsend was shooting for with Ki. This album is well deserving of 5 stars and will leave the listener strongly anticipating the coming installments.
B002N2P1SE|5.0|I love the dollhouse and can't wait to see this season premiere episode.  That said...    Why pay money when hu lu dot com has the episode for free, released at the same time as it is on amazon?  I'm just curious why anyone would just throw money away like that.  hu lu has what a total of maybe 3 minutes of commercials per hour of content?  So by this logic, you are being paid 1 dollar per minute of commercial watching, that's 60 an hour to get up and get some scooby snacks and not listen to the commercial.  So if it's that bothersome, conversely, you can pay 1 dollar per minute to NOT watch commercials by paying the 3 dollars per 60 min of content on amazon.  You get to make the choice, but it's a pretty easy choice for me!  I'm not trying to hurt amazon on demand but c'mon lets get real about charging nearly the same as a movie for tv- sounds like a business model is really screwed up.
1416594787|5.0|'This book is necessary', booms the authorial auto-proclamation in the Appendix, and those of us who have followed to the end the various phases of Richard Dawkins lucid and colourful exposition of the evidence for evolution are unlikely to disagree. How necessary it is can be seen from the worrying results of Gallup poll questionnaires discussed in the same Appendix, and at several stages throughout this excellent addition to the Dawkins canon the baneful effect of the `history deniers' is highlighted. A chapter on the origin of our own species includes the transcript of a less than profitable exchange between Dawkins and a creationist, one Wendy Wright of an organisation called `Concerned Women for America'. When reminded that there are such things as museums which house evidence (and this is not including the Creation Museum of Kentucky, which houses none) her response is a series of Sarah Palinesque squeaks about very little, concluding with the exhortation to `believe in a loving God who created each one of us'. Much the same point is made in an anecdote concerning the author's colleague Dr John Endler who once, in conversation with a fellow passenger on a domestic US flight, dropped a clanger by telling him that his research was guided by Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Their conversation up to that point had been amicable with the man showing an intelligent curiosity, but at the mention of such an ungodly name and subject his demeanour changed completely.<br /><br />Here, the newcomer to evolution is eased into it gently with a discussion of the difference between a theorem and a `theorum'. An example of the former is a mathematical proof which brooks no argument, while a theorum cannot be proved in the same way. Instead it is supported by a massive body of evidence, for example the `theorum' that the earth is not flat, or that species were not suddenly conjured into existence. Emphasis is placed on the value of inference, and scientists investigating evolution are like detectives arriving on the scene after the event, piecing together from the available evidence what in all probability happened but was not observed at first hand. `The `God of the evolutionary gaps' argument beloved of creationists is thus plainly silly. A supernatural being can no more account for the gaps in the evolutionary record than for the gaps in, say, a murder investigation caused by a malfunctioning CCTV camera that failed to record the deed.<br /><br />Following Darwin in the `Origin of the Species' Dawkins begins with variation under domestication. This is where man, rather than nature, is the agent of change in plants and the shape and behaviour of wild animals, the artificial `sculpting' of the gene pool. Dog breeders choose which dogs mate with which to achieve the desired characteristics and the current variety of breeds is something that took centuries, or even decades, to evolve rather than millions of years. There is a description later on of an experiment in which silver foxes were specifically bred for tameness in the interests of Russia's fur trade. When we come on to the subject of flowers it is the same story as dogs or foxes, except that the process took millions of years of `sculpting' by insects' eyes and antennae, natural as opposed to artificial selection. Part of the intimate relationship between flowers and their pollinators is the `trade-off', which has nothing to do with altruism. Something is always given in exchange for something else, and sexual selection, as Darwin named it, is vital in the propagation of any species. For example peahens choose attractive peacocks for breeding, thereby preserving attractive genes.<br /><br />In the story of evolution fossils play an important part. The Victorian term for `gap in the fossil record' was `missing link', but it is no longer appropriate as we now have fossils linking modern humans with the common ancestor that we share with chimpanzees. There are portmanteau words jokily coined by creationists as part of their attempt to discredit evolution (frog and monkey conflate into `fronkey', crocodile plus duck equals 'crocoduck') but the joke is on them. Not only did monkeys and frogs share an ancestor, which would have looked nothing like either, but `every one of the millions of species of animals shares an ancestor with every other one'. All Dawkins' examples of human fossils, the various `Homos' and `Australopithecuses', are links that are no longer missing. Chapter 10, `The Tree of Cousinship' considers further the descent from a single ancestor of all living creatures in whom the DNA code is invariant while the individual genes vary. Incidentally colour plate 8b features an attractive `crocoduck' tie of which Dawkins is the proud owner, but as far as I can gather they are not on sale yet to the general public.<br /><br />Continental drift and plate tectonics are also important as they enable us to understand how species diverged and are distributed over the world's continents and islands. We can see how the Brazilian coast fits the bulge of West Africa having been joined together with it around 165 million years ago as part of the Gondwana super-continent. Apparently creationists accept that there was continental drift but think that, instead of taking millions of years, it all must have happened during the forty days and nights of Noah's flood. On the subject of geological time there are three principle means of establishing the age of the earth and dating fossils; dendrochronology (`tree rings'), radioactive clocks and carbon dating. The general reader will be on somewhat difficult terrain with the second of these as it is not a subject easily reducible to lay terminology although Dawkins does his best and, still with the non-specialist reader in mind, he defers a consideration of molecular clocks to a later stage. He is always as lucid as his material permits and in the account of an experiment with the E. coli bacterium, which shows evolution occurring before our eyes, we are advised not `to read this section of the book while tired'. The tone is schoolmasterly but when the master is as erudite and good-humoured as Dawkins we may perhaps consider it a pleasure, and reassuring, to be thus patronized.<br /><br />The weight of evidence is very much against the intervention of a designer, unless it was a designer that kept having second thoughts about the appearance of his progeny and how he wanted it to function. Whales were once land-dwellers in some form or other, as is evident from tiny bones that are useless now but once formed the hind legs of their walking ancestors. Flightless birds such as ostriches and emus retain mere stubs of wings and are therefore obviously descended from birds that could fly, while subterranean creatures like salamanders have `vestigial' eyes, remnants of an earlier above-ground phase of their evolution which now suffice for where there is poor light or none atall. This is not so much `unintelligent design', just changes and improvisations, but the human eye is an example of appallingly bad design with its back-to-front retina and photocells pointing the wrong way, corrected of necessity by natural selection. Also illustrative is the circuitous path traced by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (bizarre enough in humans, even more so in giraffes) and the indirect route of the vas deferens from the testis to the penis in humans (whether the same applies to giraffes is not stated). Bad back trouble in some of us is traceable to the fact that we have only been walking on our hind legs for one per cent of 400 million years, insufficient time for proper readjustment from our long-adopted quadrupedal posture. Presumably a designer would have gone back to the drawing board and started from scratch instead of tinkering with the botched, unrealised version of the prototype. As for nature's great `arms race it does not play out according to any conceivable plan.If trees had been blessed with the power of rational thought - that is, if a designer had paid due attention to the task in hand - they would be able to agree about what height they should grow to when forming a cluster. That way they would all get a fair share of the available sunlight and ` photon rain' instead of selfishly trying to outgrow one another. On a less pleasant note cheetahs, through natural selection, are efficient killing machines which prey on gazelles while the latter, also through natural selection, have become extremely good runners so that they can escape from their attackers.

0061730327|5.0|He was a brilliant young man living in the throes of intense poverty in the small landlocked African nation of Malawi.  When William Kamkwamba was 14 he was forced to drop out of school.  His family was simply too poor to afford the fees needed to attend secondary school in his country.  Young William was heartbroken at this turn of events.  He longed for an education but understood the dire financial circumstances his family was in.  But William Kamkwamba was a resourceful sort and would find another way to educate himself.  \\"The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind:  Creating Currents of Electricity of Hope\\" tells the amazing story of William Kankwamba in his own words.  This is truly a remarkable story that you will never forget.<br /><br />It is incredibly difficult to grasp just how poor most people in Malawi are.  For example, in the town where William Kamkwamba grew up there was no electricity and no running water.  William's mother had to spend two hours each day carrying water home from the public well.  Since there was no electricity people just went to bed most nights when darkness fell.  The threat of famine was everpresent in Malawi and AIDs and malaria were widespread and deadly.  Unable to attend school, William helped his father plant and tend the maize and tobacco that would hopefully sustain the family for another year.  Farming was just about the only way that most families in Malawi could make a living.  But everyone was painfully aware that drought was ever a looming threat.  When the rains stopped starvation and disease among the people became even more rampant.  It seems that life had always been this way in Malawi.<br /><br />One day William and his best friend Gilbert went to the local library looking for books.  Being ever fascinated by how things worked 14 year old William picked out three titles that piqued his curiosity.  The books he selected were \\"Explaining Physics\\",  \\"Using Energy\\" and \\"Intergrated Science\\".  What he learned from studying these volumes would change his life forever.  In one of these books William spotted a photograph of a windmill.  He read about how a windmill worked and somehow he immediately understood.  He thought to himself \\"I can make one of those\\" and despite numerous obstacles from that point on he would not be deterred.  William determined that building a windmill would solve two pressing problems for his family.  First,  the windmill would provide lighting for their home.  In addition, he figured out that a windmill could also rotate a pump for water and irrigation.  He thought to himself \\"If we hooked it up to our shallow well at home, a water pump could allow us to harvest twice a year.  A windmill and a pump could also provide my family with a year-round garden where my mother could grow things like tomatoes, Irish potatoes, Cabbage, mustards and soybeans, both to eat and sell in the market.\\"  \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\\" chronicles the incredible story of how William pieced together his rudimentary windmill from scraps of metals, trash and anything else he could find.  He was teased and tormented by those who thought him a fool.  But he persisted and in the end he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.  His story would become a worldwide sensation.<br /><br />There are a lot of lessons to be learned  in \\"The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind\\"  Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope\\".  For one thing I am certainly more aware of just how fortunate we in the developed world are.  For the people of Malawi and places like it life is a struggle each and every day.  William certainly taught me a great deal about determination and perserverance.  Finally, it was never clearer to me just how important education is.  \\"The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind\\" is a surprisingly well-written book that I would recommend to anyone but most especially to those of high school and college age.

0061730327|5.0|This book is first of all the story of William Kamkwamba of Malawi. William is raised in a Christian home in a community of subsistent farmers where superstition and witchcraft hold sway. In this environment, William betters his life and that of his family by tenaciously pursuing innovation. On another level, it is the story of how education can so effectively battle superstition, ignorance and poverty. Finally this is the story of a nation and how  William's benefactors are having an impact on his entire village, starting a chain of economic and quality of life improvements and equipping leaders which may ultimately affect his nation and even his continent.    Rarely do I read a book that I would recommend as heartily as this one. William's story is moving, but it is also challenging. William has done so much with so little. This book encourages the reader to do more with their abundant resources. William's story also shines a spotlight on how  productive community development iniatives can be.

I like that they are showing \\"others\\" point of view.  I have read all 9 books and the books are based on Sookie's point of view...there is not much in book one about Tara...however, season one has a lot about Tara...and Jason.  I feel they took book one, highlighted all the major parts and then jazzed up the show with what they added.  Great job.  I was thoroughly entertained and cant wait for Season two.

B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido, who first caught my eye when a few years she put down a haunting and mesmerizing track on an Eminem  rap  entry, is now an international superstar. Her stage presence, the sometimes gloomy content of her material and the feature she retains of being fit and energetic all adds up to her aura of enthusiastic and then sometimes blue eyed soul aspect of her delivery. Of note is Lily Allen, also another UK phenomenon that continues to take on the world. If you are old enough to remember Dusty Springfield and the effect she had on her motley ethnic audience we have to assume that there is something in the water in the UK that has always been responsible for astounding musical ability and talent. This DVD exemplifies that idea and is produced perfectly because I know that Dido has precise management all though does not overdo the PR. FYI, if you wish, I have posted another Dido review recently on my Amazon reviewer site should you wish additional opinion and information.<br /><br />Jay Adler

0385504225|3.0|Having read all of Dan Browns books at least twice, I was anticipating the release of this book. Unfortunately I am disappointed after finishing the Lost Symbol. I have a simple formula for judging a book;    1) Do I feel the need to read it every free minute I have?  2) After reading it, do I anticipate the next book?  3) Do I look forward to reading it again?    And the answer is NO to all of the above. I guess Dan is a victim of his own success as this book is formulaic at best. I didn't buy into the idea that the information the CIA feared would be released was that big of a deal.     On a positive note, I'm sure Washington DC will have many more visitors.....

B00178JDCK|5.0|Bought Verbzilla, Digitech RV-7, and the verbzilla's ripoff : Behringer RV600.<br />The types of reverb i get from Verbzilla is very insignificant to be used for my synths .. so for that many kind of modes, barely useful. And I HATE the fact that line 6 always used the MIX knob instead of the separated level and reverb/fx level, cos you have to sacrifice your volume to get an extreme reverb, which is sucks.<br /><br />Then i tried the digitech rv-7. First thought was .. Wow, what a construction it's got there. Fancy knobs, and additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover, velcro, glow in the dark sticker. And the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it. I love this one better than the verbzilla, cos you don't have to sacrifice the volume to get a heavy reverb.. but the problem was .. there's no heavy reverb there. I couldn't get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal. But I love the gated reverb feature among all modes. Every other modes are just nothing special really. It was just a light reverb i get.<br /><br />Aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal .. skeptical at first, and i can see that it has also the mix knob like verbzilla has I was a little disappointed. But I really can sense my juno 60 and my moog sings differently on each modes with this one. And I'm very happy that the mix and the decay could go ridiculous without having volume loss as much as the verbzilla does. It could be painful for guitar players, cos they cannot boost up your guitar volume without anything else if it's already full, but I could always gain the volume of my synth to balance it with the mix knob (since i never put the volume knob on the synth at full). I could sense the difference of each modes with this pedal and it's hell loads of them.<br /><br />Let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that i've tried.. they are ALL battery hogs! It was ridiculous .. i mean bad bad ridiculous that it was only lasted about 5-10 mins of nonstop use of battery before it's dried up. So I suggest you to use the power adapter. And the only thing i hate about RV600 is the way that we have to put back the battery cover to it's place cos we have to put the spring back to it's track while closing it slowly, and that black plastic latch on the side doesn't feel it could last long<br /><br />I don't care what ppl said about this pedal, but it's been very useful for me and my synthesizers, we don't need to get an expensive gears as long as we can make great sounds. It's all comes back to our ability to make good music. Good luck guys!So I suggest you to use the power adapter.

B001DU8T6S|2.0|Okay, let me start by saying that I am a huge Queen fan. Or should that be, I was. I've had a massive problem with the way Queen's legacy has been dragged through the mud by Brian May and Roger Taylor. Performing with Britney Spears, Robbie Williams, Five (Remember them) and McFly in order to appeal to a younger audience really struck me as kind of pathetic. I've heard them excuse this as them wanting to keep the Queen flame alight, but in truth it has simply served to extinguish it altogether. After the release of Made In Heaven, they should have left well enough alone. That way their stature would have grown, like that of The Beatles maybe. Macca and the boys never had to demean themselves by continuing to perform under The Beatles banner with fly-by-night inferior popstars after the death of John Lennon. No silly Beatles musicals, or The Beatles featuring Britney Spears in a sad attempt to remain in the limelight. No adverts for soft drinks!    It always strikes me as odd that Queen add the plus sign to their name whenever they perform with another artist... Queen + Paul Rodgers, Queen + Robbie Williams, etc. It is clear to me that since the death of the IRREPLACEABLE Freddie Mercury, and of course John Deacon having left the band, they instead should have put the minus symbol next to their name. Queen -     I used to blush whenever Queen came on the TV or the radio, because everyone knew how big a fan I was and they would all instantly look at me, as if to say \\"Ooh, your boys are on\\". Now I blush for different reasons. It is so sad to see Brian and Roger desperately trying to cling onto their celebrity. Queen were such a force at one time. Powerful, mesmerizing, and largely misunderstood by fools who couldn't see past the overblown theatrics and high camp. Listen to the Innuendo album for confirmation of this. The title track is simply awe-inspiring stuff. The sheer audacity of that group. Show me any band now with that same sense of fun. There simply isn't one.Only the Foo Fighters come close, in terms of being able to make fun of themselves in music videos etc.     But after all this, and against my better judgment I'm still a fan. I had to have this album, if only for my inner fifteen-year old who would have loved to hear what Brian and Roger were capable of in old age. And in truth, it isn't awful. Paul Rodgers is undoubtedly a great vocalist in his own right. The songs are... well, pleasant enough. It is certainly well-crafted, but that's to be expected from these guys. In truth it isn't a 1 star album. How could it be when you have Brian and Roger at the helm. But Queen it ain't. And that's where my problem lies. This just lacks passion, spark and most disappointingly it lacks wit. Aah, Freddie's unique wit! How I miss him so. And this album just brings that to bear. If you're a completist you will already have this, like myself. You may never listen to it- I certainly don't, but you'll have it, because you have to. If though you are a casual fan, sidestep this release and go and get hold of some real Queen. The Queen that had Freddie in it. And John Deacon. The only Queen.

I would not recommend this to a beginner but I would recommend it to someone who wanted to maintain pre-pregnancy fitness. Even though I was in decent shape before pregnancy, the first time I tried the workout I was quite surprised at how difficult it was - there are lots of squats!!  However, after a couple times it got easier.  I was able to get a good workout without over doing it.  I like that you only need the wall, your couch and a chair for this video.  You could use a yoga mat too, but most of the time I just did the floor exercises without one (I have carpet).  I did find this workout to be too much during my last month of pregnancy... I was having back pain and the workout did not help (nothing helped!!).  Still this was a great video to have and I always felt great when I was finished.
B0006H4B52|5.0|This \\"coming-of-age\\" story was almost required viewing for high schoolers back in the '70s. Although somewhat dated by folky Cat Stevens tunes and Vietnam War-era overtones, the main story remains a powerful one.<br /><br />Harold is a 20-year-old rudderless son of wealth. Obssessed with mortality, Harold frightens off any girls his mother arranges dates for him with by simulating his own suicide, using a variety of tricks in the process. He converts a gift sports car into a creepy mini-hearse and indulges in his favorite pastime, attending the funerals of strangers. It is at one of these that Harold first meets Maude, a spry 79-year-old lady with a zeal for living that is positively infectious.<br /><br />The two embark on several adventures, which include rescuing a dead city tree to plant it in the woods, and giving Harold's patriotic Army officer uncle a shocking surprise. Through all this, Maude teaches the youth how to play banjo and most importantly: how to embrace life. Harold declares his love for this amazing old gal and clings to her despite protests from family and minister. And then the eve of Maude's 80th birthday arrives....<br /><br />Related items:<br />Bud Cort has a minor role in Robert Altman's [[ASIN:B000BZISTE M*A*S*H]] (1970).<br />Ruth Gordon and an enormous cast of loonies appear in the cult comedy/disaster film fave, [[ASIN:B00005JLCC THE BIG BUS]] (1976).

0061730327|4.0|One cannot help but be impressed by the story of William Kamkwamba, who, at the age 14, figured out (with help from just a few library books written in English, a language he was not fluent in) how to build a windmill to power his village.    Because his story is so fascinating, I felt that it took entirely too long for him, in his memoir, to discuss how he came to build his windmill. While William's family and cultural environment are certainly key to understanding his circumstances, there was just too much background information before the meat of the story began. The beginning of the book describes in far too great of detail his father's ability to hold liquor and beat other men in fights to be relevant to William's education and intellect, and similarly discussions about village witchcraft occupy excessively long sections. The obviously personally relevant sections on famine during his childhood were heartbreaking and certainly yielded a much deeper understanding for his motivation to produce energy independence and accessible water for his family and village. Unfortunately, towards the end of the book, he discusses the projects he developed after the windmill, but these take less than one page! I would have loved to have read at least a chapter on how these were developed.    Perhaps because I am interested in developing some of these projects, which may make me an atypical reader, I would have liked more information on how one can learn to think more like he does, and how one would replicate or create similar projects to his.    I salute William for his accomplishments, and I am delighted that he has found a way to share his story with a broader audience. His memoir is a thoroughly inspiring read.
1416594787|5.0|Evolution is a fact, and this book will prove it, so says Dawkins in his new book. He also says that evolution is not taught in public schools because schools (the government) are fearful of being called \\"racist\\" because of the growing Muslim population in not only the United States, but other countries as well.<br /><br />When Darwin gave us his Orgin of Species, there was far less evidence than we have now. That's what Dawkins presents us with in his book.<br /><br />Evolution is change in the genetic material of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. Though changes produced in any one generation are normally small, differences accumulate with each generation and can, over time, cause substantial changes in the population, a process that can culminate in the emergence of new species.<br /><br />Evolution, says Dawkins, is not a theory. It's a fact. Scientists can only \\"disprove\\" things, he says. They don't prove them. Evidence supports evolution, says Dawkins.<br /><br />Dawkins begins his discussion with artificial selection and moves on to natural selection. He then discusses the time it takes for evolution to take place and how that is accomplished.<br /><br />We don't notice the change known as evolution for the same reason we do not notice a child that we see daily grow and change into an adult. We only see the difference if we see the person as a child and then much later as an adult. So it is with evolution. The change in a species is gradual, quite slow, over a long period of time.<br /><br />This is not a rehash of Darwin, although Darwin is discussed. But much was not known in Darwin's day. DNA, for example. Genes for another thing. Dawkins discusses this and explains the part these things play in the proof of evolution.<br /><br />He describes how flowers came to look as they do. For example, he tells us how insects have an effect on the design of flowers. This is natural selection, according to Dawkins.<br /><br />Dawkins has an interesting discussion of natural selection and artificial selection regards genetics. He discusses, among other species, the domestic dog. To illustrate, my big dog was bred specifically to be a herder. Unfortunately, all she has to herd are my two cats. But she does an excellent job of it. She also often nudges me behind my knees with her long nose to get me to go where I need to go. This is artificial selection breeding. This is what her ancestors were bred to do. And Dawkins addresses this quite well.<br /><br />The dog was artificially bred from the wolf. It was domesticated. Each breed has a purpose. Some were bred to work, others to herd and yet others to maneuver in water. In much the same way, nature breeds her creatures. An interesting point Dawkins makes is that when a creature is gifted in one way, it must pay in another. For example, if a species has especially long legs and is a great, fast runner, it must pay in being slow or inept or less than normal in another area. Moreover, the extra long legs can more easily break than shorter legs. So nature, it would seem, is a great equalizer.<br /><br />Dawkins does an excellent job of giving the reader a good background in evolution. He doesn't miss anything. He even discusses bacteria and fossils. If the reader will go into the book with an open mind, he can get an excellent understanding of what evolution actually is. The myths are disspelled.<br /><br />The author tells the reader that is there were indeed an intelligent design, such a designer would have perfected the back and sinuses, for example. Both of these areas give most all humans misery. The reason is the way they're made --- not at all to do the job we need done with them.<br /><br />For example, humans are not evolved from monkeys. Rather they had a common ancestor. Regardless of your beliefs, you at least should want to learn what evolution really is and base your opinions on the truth and not popular, but false, beliefs.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutcheson
B001FB4W0W|4.0|This starts out with a nice premise.  Some company in Japan designs synthetic human blood and guess what, vampires can use it.  They can now come out of the closet (er, coffin) and go mainstream with the mortals.  So far so good.  With this premise HBO weaves a reasonably logical and consistent plot that generally works.      But all is not bliss in vampire USA because there are a bunch of idiosyncrasies that might bother some people.  The main location is in some small town in Louisiana, that's filled with 20 or 30 year old, 2% fat, beefcakes and cheesecakes.  And sex, don't forget about sex.  Everybody loves it, including the vampires.    Also, the people of this quaint locale are dropping off like flies.  While they haven't had a murder in the last 10 or 20 years, mortals and vampires are now getting bumped off in droves.  And they don't go quietly or cleanly.    And did I mention the girl who reads minds and loads of other strange happenings ....      As long as the above doesn't stop you from running and screaming out of the room, you will probably like True Blood.  What makes the first season fun is the clever writing from HBO.  There is a feeling of reality to the vampire based situations and often with a sense of humor.  For example, when the main babe meets Bill the vampire, she asks,  \\"Bill?  What kind of vampire name is that?  I was expecting Anton or Xavier, but not Bill.\\"    My only real complaint about True Blood is the soap opera feel to it.   Sex, death, and gore has never scared me away from movies, but some of the plot twists in the first season might.   Did he/she/it really do that, have it happen to them, etc. etc.  Perhaps that's what breaks the tension and allows you to not take True Blood too seriously and still come back next week.    That said, the first season was good enough to come back for refills of True Blood.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I first saw this film when I was 16 and still living in England.  Mary Stuart Masterson is the perfect (georgeous) Tom Boy and Eric Stoltz is the perfect school freak.  If you enjoy any of the Brat pack films i highly recommentd this film.    Just a fantastic story with a great cast and an ending that will have you wishing you were Eric! (If you are guy.....)    Buy this and enjoy for a long time to come.

I have bought several copies so that I can show it to my clients! Highly recommended.
B000GAKBLW|4.0|Back in the days when the Ruskies were known as the USSR, they invented a supersonic attack plane MiG-31 (Firefox) with the ability to respond to thought. They had it and wee wanted it. So we decided to sneak in and take it. The only problem was that to operate it you had to have Ruskie thoughts as it could tell the difference.<br /><br />Out only hope was retired pilot Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood) but still a tuffy. His mission is to sneak into the USSR and pilfer the plane. Little did we know there is a second plane and a tuffy Ruskie pilot, so the chase is on. To add to the tension Mitchell was a Vietnam prisoner and suffers under stress.<br /><br />Will he succeed or be shot out of the sky?<br /><br />The story was probably inspired but the Soviet defection to Japan in the 70's when we pulled their advanced MiG apart to fined that while we moved on to electronic controls that they were still using wire and hydraulics. How ever when we realized it was immured to Electro-magnetic-pulse we had to take a sober look.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000CABAQ Clint Eastwood - Adventurer (Firefox / Space Cowboys / White Hunter Black Heart)]]
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|A disappointing and predictable novel that isn't novel at all. Save your money and your time.
1594202249|1.0|This book is awful.  The characters are so one dimensional that you can't get into them at all.  The dialogue is so phony.  Did every person in the late 60's really say \\"groovy\\" every third sentence?  The plot is hard to follow with many characters drifting in and out of the story.  Save your money and buy any other book.
0060853980|4.0|Hilarious, witty, constant laughs and very smartly written.<br /><br />Unfortunately it confirmed a fear of mine.  I have tried, but I just don't like Neil Gaiman's writing.  This is by far the best of the books with his name on it I read, but the parts I liked had Terry Pratchett's signature all over them...had it not been for Terry I don't think I'd like it at all.<br /><br />Moral of the story - if you like Terry Pratchett, you'll probably like this book.  If you like Neil, you might anyway.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown's new book \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is actually a very good read.  No, it isn't as good as Angels & Demons or The DaVinci Code, but it is a good book on it's own.  I did have a few problems with how the main character (RL) reacted.  After reading about him in the previous two books, I had an expectation of how RL would react or assimilate information.  It was annoying that he had such a closed mind after his other adventures.    I might be the only person willing to admit it, but I did not guess the villian's true idenity.  Maybe I just fell into Brown's trap...usually I'm the first person to know whodoneit. And the drowning scene suprised me.  Of course, I did know what was happening but it still suprised me.    So would I pay full price for The Lost Symbol?  Nope.  But I bought it on my Kindle, so I only paid $10.  It's definitely worth $10!!!

B0025KVLT2|2.0|They really should have spent some more time on Rubber Soul.  The stereo mix is terrible on many of the tracks. Nowhere Man's vocals are too loud and the guitar is too soft. The Nowhere Man version on the 1999 Yellow Submarine album is far superior.  If I Needed Someone sounds good as does a few other tracks on the 2009 SR; however, we should demand superior sound engineering for this Beatles gem.
0470477237|5.0|When you are looking for news or information do you turn on the TV or your computer?    Do you even have to search for it any more?    Socialnomics walks us through the rapid evolutionary growth of social media and how it has changed / impacted our lives.    Things have changed dramatically, we are no longer looking for things online (information, news, reviews), it is finding us on our mobile devices while we're sitting in the movies, driving in our cars, or waiting for us when we wakeup.    And this is not a one way push of information, it's a two way conversation, because companies will hear from us regarding their products and behavior, they don't dare ignore us because our thoughts and concerns will reach more people by twitter, Facebook, and YouTube faster and more thoroughly than their advertising budget ever could.    Companies are making the shift from \\"creating and pushing\\" to engaging, listening, and reacting to our needs.    Socialnomics is an easy and insightful read whether you want to understand how social media can help your business or if you simply want to understand how it shapes today's society.    A great example is the chapter on how Barack Obama's success was driven by social media, it has forever changed the face of political campaigns.    One of my favorite lines from the book is \\"live your life like your mother is watching, because she probably is\\".    On a recent trip away (without my family) I was surprised by how much we used Facebook to communicate, unlike the telephone, it allowed us to communicate at times when it was convenient for both sides.    The new social media world is here, we can either learn to live in it, or be left behind.    If you are part of the first group, Socialnomics will give you a better insight of the new world and help you better navigate in it.    It gets two thumbs way up.
1439157383|5.0|This book definitely pulls on the heart strings.  I knew that going in; however, I was surprised at how much this book affected me, even before the ending.  Jodi Picoult is an excellent writer/ philosopher.  This book constantly caused me to think about all sorts of interpersonal relationships throughout my lifetime.  It made me re-examine some of my own past issues and even helped me release a few of them and put them behind me. I didn't even know some of the issues were lurking there, just under the surface.      I was surprised at how many different emotions the book stirred up. This book is not just about two sisters struggling with a life/death situation.  It delves into the different ways family, friends, and mere acquaintences treat all the members of a family coping with a terminal illness of a loved one - how living with  the imminent death of someone in the household day-after-day, year-after-year can steal the life from the entire household, yet the love is still there.    Have your tissues handy.  Reading this book in public might cause one to embarrass one's self!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Does Bill Murray do any comedy? Does me wind up in bed with the co-star? Do their small touches and kisses move the film forward? Does the hype about staying another day for \\"the Japanese Johnny Carson\\" live up to its expectations? Does he leave his wife? Does she leave her husband? Does he ever drink whiskey and not iced tea? Is the Japanese comedy ever explained? No, no, no, no and no.    I got this movie because it was in the $5 bin, had Bill Murray in it, and some blind/deaf mutant put four stars on the cover. Well I will give it four stars if the scale is 1-100.    The entire movie is like the part of TV shows they play before the opening credits roll. Seriously. YES there are opportunities for more character depth and a great story, but it would take 116 years to do so. These characters travel slower than real life. This would be part one of a hundred parts spanning decades.    It is no surprise it is 15 cents here!    Please, get Caddyshack, Meatballs, Stripes, ANYTHING!
B000002B30|4.0|The sound quality was very good to my ear.    I counted 13 significant hits out of 18 total on the CD.  I don't understand why more top 20 hits weren't included.      Reading allmusic's list of hits, I counted 17 top 20 hits that weren't on the CD, plus \\"Pink Cadillac\\", the popular flip side of \\"Born to Run\\".    Perhaps it's a matter of which chart one follows when selecting greatest hits.  That could leave a lot of room for personal preference.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Anyone who has already absorbed this disc over the weekend will agree that Mark Knopfler produces original music on outstanding recordings anchored by an electric guitar for the ages, and is a treasure for all humanity.   That is, after all, why we preordered it back in July.   I give it five stars because I would give it all five stars, and leave the criticism to the poor lad who wishes for a reprise of Walk of Life or Money for Nothing.  And if you want something radio-ready, you have it in Cleaning My Gun.    This disk is a carefully measured dose of the good stuff wrapped in a pleasant package.   I welcome the traditional instrumentation: Kill to Get Crimson still grows on me.   The songs on Get Lucky don't feel as natural to me yet, but perhaps that will come with time.  On some the instrumentation dominates the guitar, which always leads (though deliciously subtly) on Kill to Get Crimson.   On this disk, one's hunger for that aching guitar sound must be satisfied by The Car Was the One.  And there is one of those dark, gruff treasures in Before Gas and TV.    But these songs are too short.  Surely Mr. Knopfler knows how hard it is for his fans to make these releases last for a year or two.    There is much more on this disk to enjoy and digest (Border Reiver, Far from the Clyde).  But some of us can never get enough.
159448385X|5.0|At first, I was a bit hesitant to read this book-I read The Kite Runner which was an amazing work in both its story telling and artistry. I was sure that Hosseini wouldn't be able to accomplish another great piece of work (especially when told from the perspective of two women). Not only was I wrong, but in some ways, I think it surpassed his first novel.    I find that Hosseini has a gift for writing compelling narrative that is often painful and cringe-inducing to read; yet at the same time,  difficult to stop. The struggles that Laila and Mariam have to go through are often so traumatic and emotional that I found myself nearly welling up with tears. But Hosseini's ability to show their strength and perseverance is absolutely brilliant and what makes it overall so moving.  On top of that, the breathtaking descriptions of scenery and culture from Afghanistan are amazing and I found myself researching the country-something I couldn't say after the first book.    If there was some type of criticism which I might lobby, it would be when the events of 9/11 are brought up and then discussed amongst the characters. As a native New Yorker who lived near the World Trade Center at that time, it brought up a lot of my own personal feelings/biases and started to take me out of the story. However, maybe this was what Hosseini intended. Either way, it was far from a deal-breaker.    I wholeheartedly recommend this book to someone looking for an engrossing and emotional story. As long as you can deal with its mature themes it's a definite must-read.

I have snorkeled extensively and water definitely gets in this snorkel when you are swimming. It would be rated a 5 if it had a purge valve associated with it.
0385504225|4.0|While it isn't The DaVinci Code this was a great, gripping book!  I could not put it down and I was up until 1am trying to finish this!  My favorite thing about Dan Brown is his ability to make you want MORE.  You just cannot stop reading.  I love the suspensful way he will end a chapter and then move on to something else the next chapter...I almost want to skip ahead to find out what happened but also don't want to miss one, single thing.<br />Yes, this book is predictible at parts but so what?  It is a great read.<br />The biggest thing to remember with Brown is it is FICTION.  He does not claim that his books are true.  It is a wonderful tale that, yes, will make you think and turn to Google to look some stuff up :)<br />It was a good follow up to The DaVinci Code.  Now I am waiting anxiously for the next Robert Langdon book!
0307266303|4.0|Good book, but to be taken with a grain of salt. Poetic license and exaggeration is used. I have been to Copper Canyon and met the Tarahumara. They are independent and healthy. They are to be respected and admired, but they are not that secretive or inaccessible. In today's world of 4WD and dual sport motorcycles, adventurous types visit Batopilas on a regular schedule, and if you befriend a Tarahumara and gain his trust, you may be invited to visit and stay in a remote village.
0783233477|5.0|I must confess that I consider this movie a masterpiece.  As a real film buff, there are certain movies that I can watch over and over again, and garner something different from each viewing.  This is one of those films.  A 20 year old will see a completely different film than someone of middle age or a senior.  That is part of the movie's charm.  It cannot truly be appreciated on the first viewing.  It is a deep and moving experience and must be savored, like a fine wine.  The performances are truly amazing - the always remarkable Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt in, I think one of his finest roles, and a luminous Claire Forlani (without her accent), under, what I understand to be Martin Brest's somewhat perfectionist direction, is well worth however many takes it took to obtain this near perfect result.    Well worth a look - or twenty!

B00003CXRM|3.0|* By \\"Dummies\\" I don't mean viewers have to be dumb to watch it; rather, I am referring to the popular series of books published by IDG Books during the 1990s, which made technology and later varied subjects accessible to readers. To that end, making this film required viewing in schools might get kids interested in classic literature. The lesson plan could even include watching \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" then reading Homer's Odyssey.<br /><br />Still, this film is different than most of what shows up in theaters, and thus not everyone will love it, at least not on first viewing. I thought Clooney's character was over the top, and was disappointed to learn that he was the only one who didn't do his own singing. Great supporting roles all around, though.<br /><br />To me, the best part is the music (2001 Grammy for Album of the Year).<br />[[ASIN:B00004XQ83 O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]<br /><br />As for the disc itself, this was the first and so far only DVD release in this country, and it is practically screaming out for a multi-voice commentary. Perhaps Buena Vista is waiting to release a 10th Anniversary Edition this year? Rating: 3.5 stars, rounded down until they come out with a better DVD.
0896898288|5.0|I LOVE this book.  The stories are charming and I find the templates easy to work with.  While maybe not a good choice for a first-time quilter (there are no instructions on how to assemble each and every block) I found it easy to put the blocks together (that I have done to date) based on the layout provided on each page.    I would highly recommend this book! Especially for those who enjoy piecing (hand or machine).  This book differs from similar type books in that this is a book that you can piece together each block easily from the samples or with the templates rather than having to foundation piece the blocks to get them to work. This would be typical of the era.    I loved the fact that the quilt was pieced in reproduction fabrics!    Yes, I did find the fact that I could only print one template on a page a bit of a bummer, but that's a fix for further editions.  It sure did make it easy to print templates quickly as each template was clearly marked.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles Abbey Road album has stood the test of time and now remastered sounds better than ever.

0061719544|5.0|\\"American On Purpose\\" is Craig Ferguson's no holds barred look at his own life.  From his beginnings in a poor section of Glasgow, Scotland through his drug and alcohol use, Ferguson doesn't spare the details of how he has evolved into the host of the \\"Late Late Show.\\"      Ferguson is his own harshest critic, and his true wit shows through in his writing.  The book is funny, fast-paced, and even has a happy ending!

0446677450|3.0|A good starting point for understanding how different thought processess lead to different results. I have read the book twice and must admit that I do not agree with everything that is said in this book. However, the book provides some foundation for further reading and exploration of the subject.     The contrast that the author \\"paints\\" here, is worth noting. Some reviewers and critics have suggested that there really was no rich dad or poor dad and that the characters were fictional. That may or may not be true. However, that assertion misses the point. The point isn't wheather or not the characters were real, but the different roads that each traveled to attempt to reach the same goals. The lifestyle differences that result are worth noting as well.     However, the book does lack specifics and some advice given in the book is really not applicable in the real world, especially in today's anti-corporate climate. However, the book was written a while back, so its understandable that the assertions and conclusions made by the author were applicable to the time in which it was written.     If one wants to explore the subject further, go to such books as the Millionaire Mind and the Millionaire Next Door. Also, don't attempt to incorporate or form an LLC until you understand all the legalities and perform your own due dilligence on the options available. And, understand what you want your LLC or 'C' Coporation to do. (These entities cannot be used to avoid taxes. Corporations do pay taxes.) Corporate laws vary from state to state and can be tricky. Inform yourself with specialized books on the subject and sound legal advice.
0385504225|2.0|Okay, I agree with many of the reviewers here. Great literature, it isn't. Dan Brown just doesn't get it; to be a writer, you have to actually know how to write. A little more characterization would be nice, too. Maybe make them at least two dimensional, Dan?     That being said, I went ahead and purchased The Lost Symbol rather than wait for it at the library. I should have waited.    The action is fast-paced and does keep one engaged. You do have to suspend disbelief to read this book, but that's fiction for you.     My problem with the book is that after the action ends, there's a lot of the book left. WARNING: The following constitutes a SPOILER. Can someone please explain to me how a man who has had a hand removed, basically a butcher job, in the last 24 hours, seen his son die horifically, thinks his sister may be dead, and has undergone physical and psychological torture, can think that escorting Robert Langdon around Washington DC in the middle of the night, because he deserves to understand what's gone on, is his life's priority at that moment? Please. Does Dan Brown live in a cave? Does he know nothing about human nature? Basic psychology? All that I can conclude is that in the last several chapters of this book, Brown is working out his personal theological/metaphysical/philosophical creed.     I very much enjoyed The DaVinci Code in spite of the writing, Angels and Demons not so much (just too farfetched even for fiction), but I would have to rank this one at the bottom of the Dan Brown heap. Get it from the library, or at least wait for the paperback.
B002C6K7N0|3.0|The instrumentals on this album are amazing and I have nothing bad to say in that regard as clearly Megadeth are incredible musicians. Unfortunately the lyrics do not do justice to the rest of the album.  United Abominations was fantastic all-around and thus set my expectations higher than what this album achieves.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|i was so happy to hear that whitney was coming back, i couldn't wait to get this album. there was so much buzz about it. well, i'm not that happy about it now that i have it. it's an ok album, might have to listen to it more, but her voice is soooo gone. my fav song is \\"i didn't know my own strength\\". that one track is the only one i like the most. i'll try to listen again, but.....i'm not sure about this one. i wish her much luck and success, but it's hard to hear how different her voice is.
B000286RKW|5.0|An excellent mafia movie:    GoodFellas in indeed one of the best 5 ever made mafia crime movies together with  the  Godfather 1 and 2, Casino and Once upon a time in America, in any order. It is also one of the best 5 movies ever. While the Godfather depicts the Mafia's upper circles at the Don level, GoodFellas concentrates on the street level guys who all aspire to once become made guys, hence the much rougher language and cold horrible violence with perhaps some touches of Sergio Leone who years before directed Once upon a time in America and the fantastic dollar movies. All truly great movies have several key ingredients in common one of which is an absolute perfect casting. It is fantastic to see how carefully each and every character appearing in the film has been selected and chosen.  Perfect roles by Robert de Niro and Ray Liotta and of course for many Joe Pesci made the movie. How nice to see Paul Sorvino, Tony Darrow, Frank Vincent, Michael Imperioli, Tony Sirico and Vincent Pastore. All these guys act as people did in the late 60's in Brooklyn and Queens. All of them went on to excellent careers and have become familiar faces. Some 20 minutes into the movie the now world famous restaurant scene begins when Pesci wants to know why he is found to be so funny. Scorsese gets all the milage from his actors, many directors have tried to imitate this scene, see for example Training Day but no one came close to the performance by Joe Pesci. The score is also very well selected with some exiting music by Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones matching some of the cruelest scenes. This 2 disc special edition has excellent quality of color and sound and the special features are worthwhile, I am so happy to add this movie to my very special collection and can recommend it highly. Thanks to the great Martin Scorsese and to Amazon for its   always great service!    Jan in Aruba.
B001TODCII|5.0|Ever here the saying \\"Art Imitates Life?\\"     This is true when it comes to this movie! Remember Natalie Hollaway\\"?...Well unfortunaley she's in some Sheiks Harem somewhere because \\"white slavery' exists, and has existed for centuries!     It's something about \\"blond hair and blue/green colored eyes\\" that is a \\"rarity\\" in the world(See Hitlers goal for an \\"Arian\\" nation) but for some reason it is considered rare and beautiful...and very expensive!     It does not get reported enough, but young white women are kidnapped every day, (especially those traveling to Foreign countries/cities)I have done the research.(I myself am an attractive African American women BTW)that nobody's looking for (Thank God)so I'm safe. But In these womens own families, as well as abroad... this rare beauty is sought after by our Gov't as well as other Third World Powers, and is exploited and perverse!!!     Read up on it! See what I'm saying is true and judge for yourself. Maybe you can find a way to help?...
B00006AW2J|5.0|Too bad the Stones departed from R&B in favor of what - psychedelia? (Her Satanic Majesties Request); disco? (Some Girls) new wave? (Emotional Rescue) and where were their heads were thoughout the entire 90's? They could have been the greatest band of the 20th century had they continued in the vein of Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers and even the convoluted Exile on Main Street, but they just ended up being a concert band, releasing albums just to increase ticket sales. If there was ever a Stones' album you needed in your collection, this is the only one. It's the Stones at their creative peak.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|Just buy the stereo boxed set. Then, if you're really picky, hit the MONO button on your home stereo unit. Then, you've got the best of both worlds....
B0013FYTA8|5.0|Every song on this CD is very very good.  These guys are so talented.  I'm sure many more of these songs will be on the radio.  Cd shipped fast and in excellant condition!
B002C6A6F4|4.0|I found this a very enjoyable movie which the whole family can get a laugh from, a bit of family fun.
B0025KVLRO|3.0|You can't make a real stereo version out of this, it was recorded on 2 track.  Of course it sounds odd.  They should have put the mono and stereo mixes on one CD.  Add to that insult, the mono box set is now \\"sold out\\"    Also, everyone needs to listen to the Arthur Anderson version of Anna, it is pretty fantastic.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I really love this series.  It's a very fun, fast paced, and addicting show.  My only complaint is that the DVDs are so expensive.  I wish they would lower the cost a bit and then I'd have no problem getting them for my collection.  Until then, I just watch 'em on NetFlix :-)
0385504225|5.0|Loved this book! I couldn't put it down.  If you are a fan of Dan Brown - you will enjoy The Lost Symbol.  But just enjoy it, don't read into so much and expect so much out of it like all these other people bashing it on Amazon reviews. LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVE!
0446560065|5.0|Simon's Cat book is probably the most brilliant of the kitty books in market. Funny, creative and real. Sometimes I think this cat is real. Of course, his antics can hurt Simon when he is asleep or watching tv but he is so adorable you're able to forgive him. What has struck me most is that how Simon's graphics teach us to treat animals humanely and with special care. I am one of the fans and it is an excellent book. Loved it. Plus this book makes a great gift.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Very good concert of MUSE, waiting to buy!    It arrived in perfect condition!    Thank you!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I have never read Dan Brown's books prior to this one. What was I thinking? I loved every minute of it! It seems like a lot of reviewers are disappointed because they think The Lost Symbol is too familiar to his previous entries, but for those of you who haven't picked up a Dan Brown book I highly recommend it!
0439023491|5.0|The looming figure of President Snow -- leader of Panem -- casts its shadow over this sequel to THE HUNGER GAMES from the opening chapter, wherein he comes to warn Katniss that she must be more convincing of her love to Peeta when on TV.  Why, you ask?  To quell the masses.  Meaning?  The natives are getting restless, and the Capitol is getting worried.<br /><br />This is the story of Katniss's attempt at complying with the Leader of the Anything-but-Free World's demands and the complications that confound her attempt.  For one, she does the wrong things on her victory tour of the other provinces, and for two, she sees more and more subtle signs of rebellion.  Should she try to head it off and thus save her family and friends from Snow's henchmen?  Or should she try to secretly feed the fire and eliminate her enemy the hard way?<br /><br />The final determination of all of this will be the next round of Hunger Games (The Quarterly Quell).  Because it is an important anniversary, the Capitol decides to choose from amongst past victors when fielding a new crop of tributes.  As the only surviving female in District 12, Katniss is in the cross hairs but good.  Coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />Every bit as exciting as the opener, this book finds new angles on the old problem by creating a very different \\"world\\" for the combatants to fight in.  Careful plotting and sound characterization lead the way.  For once, the sequel equals its predecessor!
0312539517|5.0|You will not go wrong with a Jeffrey Archer book. Again, this is a classic and enjoyable Archer read about mountain climbing with characters well considered and developed. You wonder why people could go after this sport. Look no further, Paths of Glory tells you why. This book is different in that it is based on the story of George Mallory, a climber that went after every mountain including Mt. Everest. A story of perseverance, passion and going after a dream regardless of the cost and the risk.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer is one of my favorite writers since Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less -- His development of characters through a life time or through several generations will have you wanting to read all of his books. Paths of Glory is another Jeffrey Archer classic and will not disappoint you.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|As a birthday present was the best thing I could think GIFT TO MYSELF    Excellent product arrives in perfect condition    thank you very much!    [...]
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Where to begin.  This movie is at times very touching, even tear inducing and at other times very funny.  In the past three weeks I've watched this movie at least 5 times.  I just can't get enough.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|When I first found out about Muse's new studio album, the Resistance, I was really excited.  In the year before, I had bought all four studio albums and HAARP;  I had high expectations and had become a die-hard fan. As an album, The Resistance is very coherent, but a lot less heavier than some of their other work (i.e., Origin of Symmetry, or Absolution).      Track by track:  Uprising- great opener but why the heck is this the single?  Don't get me wrong, this is a great song but there are others that would do much better as singles.    Resistance- Beautiful. This is one of the two songs that should have been a single.  The the last couple seconds remind me of Star Wars: the phantom menace, although I don't know why.  The parts with the piano sound a little bit like (VERY little, just the echo in the background) X&Y era Coldplay.  Drummers may want to hear this one.    Undisclosed Desires-  My opinion fluctuates here.  The only thing that is definite is that anyone learning to play slap bass should download this, or have a liking for dance music.  It is extremely electronic, and has no guitar or piano.    United States of Eurasia- One of the greatest songs ever written by Muse.  This is the other song that should have been a single.  I think that it is very misplaced being in the middle here.  Collateral Damage, is actually an excerpt from Frederic Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major.  If you listen to this, you will hear some parts that sound like we are the champions.  You cannot go wrong if you download this song.  It is amazing, beautiful, and very anthem like.    Guiding Light-  OK song.  Not meant to follow Eurasia.  If you are a fan of heavy distortion however, try this out.      Unnatural Selection- Heavy, but definitely worth your time. When I first heard it, I thought it sounded it familiar but I did not realize that the main riff sounds a lot like Newborn, from origin of symmetry.  Just as epic.  That being said, it is another one of the albums highlights.It is varied, even though it may sound like heavy riffing at first, however there are dynamics and tempo changes.  It is long.    MK Ultra- Reminds me a little bit of Take A Bow, and Stockholm Syndrome.  This would be more appreciated maybe if it followed Uprising.  If Unnatural Selection is too long for you, then give this one a try. They're in the same vein, only this doesn't have as noticeably drastic tempo changes, however it makes up for that with having a much darker, dire sound.  But what the heck is with the title?    I Belong To You (+Mon Coeur S'ouvre A Ta Voix)- Interesting.  It sounds a little like Muse attempted to mix classical, Jazz, and light rock. First off, a decent portion of this song is from the opera \\"Samson and Delilah,\\" which provides some nice contrast.  Based on the part written by Muse, it sort of sounds like an angry love song, with a clarinet solo.  The excerpt sounds like it is classical mixed with Jazz influences.  Provides a lot of contrast, and is a good prelude to Exogenesis.  The other half of the title is in French, and means \\"My Heart Opens to Your Voice\\".  For those who want something different from Muse.    Exogenesis     Overture-  Brilliant.  Although technically speaking, this is not an overture.  An overture samples all of the songs in piece.  This is more like the first movement of a classical piece.  Now as a piece, it is absolutely GLORIOUS.  Don't expect heavy bass or drums.  This is all about the vocals, and the strings.  It sounds like a prelude to a fight scene, or a dark journey.  Absolutely majestic.        Cross-Pollination-  The first thing I thought as it started, was Pink Floyd's Ummagumma; specifically, sysyphus.  This is the part of Exogenesis that sounds the least like a symphony.  Not as good as the overture, but decent.      Redemption-  This being a \\"symphony,\\" here is the final movement.  An excellent way to close the album, only rivaled by Eurasia.  The beginning could make someone cry, and it is quite literally, the piece one might hear during the final scene of a movie.  Worth the download    That being said, Exogenesis is absolutely amazing as a whole.  And if you get the CD you can read the lyrics, which are very much like a musical conversation.    Also, if you consider getting the DVD Bonus version, it is literally showing what they did.  There are no interviews, you are just watching fragments of recording sessions.  However it is still quite interesting to see what they are actually doing.    If you download single songs, here is what to get;    1.United States of Eurasia or Resistance  2.Exogenesis: Symphony (all parts)  3.Uprising
B002KVSJ7S|5.0|I discovered MIKA through an Entertainment Weekly review shortly after Life in Cartoon Motion came out. I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard those amazing songs for the first time. MIKA instantly became one of my all time favorite artists.<br /><br />After waiting patiently for something more, I am definately not disappointed. Every song is perfection: his voice, the harmonies, the orchestral arrangements, the lyrics, the energy, the emotion. I can't express what this music does to me. Thank you, MIKA. Please keep doing what you're doing for a very long time.
0061537969|5.0|It was reccommended that I read this book.  I took it on vacation and could not put it down.  I wonderful heart touching story that left me wondering what my own dog thinks about things!!
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|Had an 11 minute freeze, which was probably caused by my Panasonic BD 60 Blue Ray.  Otherwise, quality was excellent.<br /><br />The movie was too long.  About 2:45.  Took off 1 star for excessive length.<br /><br />The movie was flat out very enjoyable.  My perspective affects my opinion.  I am retired.  My mother died this year at 101, and spent the last several years in a nursing home.  My mother in law is 90.  I could really identify with a movie that spent a fair amount of time at a retirement home.  Realistic and sad.  If I was much younger, I probably would not have enjoyed it.<br /><br />The main plot was not realistic, but was so well done.  It's easy for me to understand why this movie received Oscar nominations.  I thought Brad Pitt, played a great role.  Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton were also excellent.  For a person of my age and backround, the movie can best be described as bittersweeet.
B001US29I2|5.0|My grandson requested this for his 9th birthday after extensive internet research.  He loves it. It has the mini figures he wanted for his collection.
1591391105|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who is going to have a promotion - of any kind, to any level. Helps to understand critical thing that must be done on the new position and ovoid critical mistakes.
0446677450|5.0|Book was in very good condition for being used! very satisified will do business again with Amazon!
0756405890|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the best fantasy novels I have read since the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. This book grips you right from the start, and doesn't let up. Character development is masterfully executed, and the main character Kvothe is one of the most wholly realized protagonists I have ever read. The combination of an academic setting and an intriguing fantasy world make for a compelling backdrop, and I was especially impressed with the way magic is portrayed in this book. No wand waving here! I look forward to the next book in the series with great anticipation.
0385504225|4.0|Lots of differing views and ideas here about this book.  I'll throw this out.  My wife and I have been readers of Neal Donald Walsh and his 'Conversations with God' series.  I was thinking early on that - yeah, this ties in a bit - and then WHAM!  Talk about bringing it all together - Dan does an excellent job of that in this book.    If you are the least bit intrigued by what you've read in this book - especially regarding the human soul - then go read some Walsh.    Oh, and one reason why Langdon would never actually be a Mason is quite simple - he's Catholic.  As a society with secrets (as opposed to a secret society, as he points out so eloquently) - the confessional would require him to divulge what was revealed unto him.    I was also quite prepared for this book to be another one of those anti-Masonic type of stories.  I was quite pleased with the way he treated the organization.  And it's pretty much an open secret now the way parts of the rituals are performed, with some variations in each state, since each state has its own Grand Lodge.  There's quite enough that is recognizable and part of open knowledge now that certainly was hidden in the past.    As for the people who complained that many of the plot elements were rehashed from other authors or from movies - I have to ask if you actually read the book with an open mind to begin with, or were looking to pick nits throughout the entire book?  The ending here was perhaps not as funny as Sophie checking the water - but it still fit with the theme.  You get a book that is a lot of exposition - you're going to have that.  Perhaps now Langdon will settle down with one of the females he's run across - it would be interesting to see what someone with the knowledge of symbology that he has could do with the knowledge that Katherine Solomon has if they worked together.    And lastly - think back, to Robert A. Heinlein and his character Valentine Michael Smith - \\"Thou Art God\\".
B00003CXDD|5.0|An international order which arrived way before estimated date. Excellent condition and quality even though second hand. Very happy with it. Thank you
0689815816|5.0|This is a fun book to read with your children. My 5 yr old boy has loved this book since he was 2. He loves to play out the story when we are going on walks.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|This set takes us from the earliest Genesis (barring the \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\" album) to the time of Peter's leaving of the group (1975) and spans the albums Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, Selling England By The Pound, and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway.  The first of these albums featured guitarist Anthony (\\"Ant\\") Phillips, while the rest feature Steve Hackett.  This box set contains many of my favorite Genesis tunes, and I am exceedingly happy with this set.    All of these albums have been painstakingly remastered and remixed, including 5.1 surround sound.  There are also extras of TV appearances and concert film work showing them at their finest,  along with very interesting, and telling, commentary from all of the principle players.    All in all this is a very good sounding set thanks to Nick Davis and I appreciate the effort he put into these recordings.  If you like the Gabriel years, you'll love this set.  5 stars.  Highly recommended.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I am sure I am not the only one who said, \\"sooo???\\" when we finally found out what was in the super duper secret briefcase.  National security??  I thought surely with the way this horrible event was being portrayed that thousands of lives would be at stake.  I hoped that maybe I'd start to really get it, but as he hammered the point over and over, I started to realize he was trying to convince himself more than the reader.<br /><br />The nonsense continued throughout with the silly death scene, the completely unnecessary inclusion of the constant discussion of advanced spoon bending (why was this in the book??  It had no place or purpose there), and the complete lack of common sense by the characters who kept letting the cliche villain get the better of them over and over.<br /><br />As a big Dan Brown fan, I was even more disappointed.  Waiting for the next big book by a favorite author is so exciting, but this one really let me down.  Sadly, if this has been my first Dan Brown book, it would have warranted him being added to my short \\"do not buy\\" list.
0553378384|5.0|For anyone -- expert astrologer or beginner -- read this book to learn how the location of the Moon's Nodes in a person's natal chart impacts them and their experience of Life. Jan Spiller has described the nodal effects so brilliantly, the chapter on each Node pair can lend phenomenally helpful information on any person who has just that one piece of information about her/himself.  Written beautifully, and without much \\"insider\\" languaging, this book is FABULOUS for getting a grasp of one's Life's foundations.  It felt as though the chapter on my Nodes was written Just For Me -- and I can't tell you how many times I've heard other people say the same thing!
0894803123|5.0|We've only tried the french vanilla receipe, but we loved it.  It was very creamy and churned very well in our churn.  Was a good consistency too. Can't wait to try more of the receipes.
B001ER4CTI|4.0|The production it self was fantastic, Very well done! The reason Im pissed is that even when buying the special limited edition they had to put advertisments and previews, This lessens the set to the point that I should of just bought the normal version, All I wanted was the film, put it in and it plays the flick and at the end offer the chapters and features, Having to F.F to the movie cheapend this for me!!!
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|There has been much controversy over the racism depicted in this movie but I think that's part of what makes a compelling Western for its time period. John Wayne, I believe, portrayed one of his first anti-heroes ever (the other being \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\\", another Ford classic) and he even named one of his sons after his character.  I've seen this classic on HD Net Movies and the transfer was fantastic--it's as if the movie was made yesterday and not in 1956!! Of course, too accolades from renowned directors such as Akira Kurosawa, David Lean (he resaw this film several times while making \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"), Martin Scorsese, George Lucas (Star Wars owes quite a bit to this), Orson Welles and Curtis Hanson have helped to push this film into the American Film Institute of all time great Westerns. I guess one flaw I had wished Ford would've removed from this classic is the cornball humor involving Vera Miles, Jeffrey Hunter and an actor who's appeared in later \\"Gunsmoke\\" as episodes by the name of Curtis!!  Anyway outside of this quibble, the virtues of this film outweigh its flaws, Wayne himself turns in perhaps his greatest performance here.  Now the question is whether to purchase in HD DVD or Blu-ray (they are both basically similiar as far as I know from previous comparisons)?   To update I did purchase the HD DVD version and it's excellent and in answer to the previous reviewer there is a difference between Standard Def and High Def (HD DVD or Blu-ray) and if he has a 720p or 1080p but if not, he would not notice it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I don't have HBO but wow do I love this series!!  Almost as great as the books!  I can't wait for season two to come out. I've already pre-ordered it.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This book was no DaVinci Code.<br />Too Cliff Claveny<br />Too predictable<br />Too slow<br />And if I never see the word \\"nonetheless\\" in a book ever again, it won't be too soon.<br />It does however make me want to take a tour of DC. So that's a plus.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) is a best selling author who has just killed off his meal ticket.  While he struggles with writer's block creating a new lead, someone starts using his books as the basis of a series of grisly murders.  When he's called in to consult on the case, he meets NY homicide detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic).  Beckett is less than impressed with the always joking Castle, but the two do make a decent team tracking down the killer.<br /><br />Beckett also sparks Castle.  In an effort to see her more often, Castle bases his new character on her.  Now he's a regular consultant with the police department, riding along with Beckett and helping her solve crimes.  Will the pairing work out?<br /><br />I must admit, this show snuck up on me, but I really enjoy it.  True, the mysteries are rather formulaic, drawing much from the writings of best selling authors.  I often have the solution figured out before Castle and Beckett, but there's often one twist that throws me along the way.<br /><br />What makes the show so fun are the characters.  Castle and Beckett don't exactly have an adversarial relationship, but she doesn't like having him shadowing her everywhere, either.  They are constantly teasing each other with quips that make it lots of fun.  Yep, another chance to get some laughs along with your mystery.  Additionally, Castle's teenage daughter and mother are living with him.  They really add to the texture of the show.  I just love their scenes.<br /><br />About the only thing that doesn't work is the romantic \\"tension.\\"  I know from what I've read, this is supposed to be part romance as well.  I'm just not buying it.  I see their relationship, at least as we've seen it so far, as more brother and sister than boyfriend and girlfriend.  Honestly, the actors have great chemistry, so it is more likely how the characters are written.<br /><br />Yes, the show has some flaws.  But the fun more than makes up for those weaknesses.  If you've missed it, get this set to get caught up quickly so you can join the fun with season two.y so you can join the fun with season two.
0385486804|5.0|Great book.  I had already seen the movie but the book gives a little more detail as to what actually happened.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|In anticipation for the release of The Lost Symbol, I went through and re-read Brown's other books.  Dan brown generally puts out a pretty good page turner.  The Lost Symbol doesn't even come close to measuring up to his other works.  I would have probably been better off renting National Treasure, than spending the time on this Davinci Code retread.
031604461X|5.0|I have to say that I read the posts from many who hated this book. With the world in such disarray, the economic crisis, and the struggle of everyday life for many, I found this to be a wonderful fantasy to behold! Escapism at it's best! Bravo! I read all four books within a week. My teenage sons asked me if they could go and see the movie after some friends had suggested it. I had not heard the hype about Edward and Bella or Twilight before taking them. You may think that I live under some rock, but having boys who are more into their Xbox than reading, I was surprised that I fell instantly in love with the movie as did they! Edward is a hero to them! Moral and just, and a vampire  \\"superhero\\" - who would have thunk it? He became a role model for teens! Cool! Waiting to have sex? Right on! Being a gentleman! Absolutely! What is wrong with this? Nothing!   Who wouldn't want everything in the end???? I love the classics! I have read and enjoyed Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Romeo and Juliet and Yargo by Jacqueline Susann, which has a kind of cult following. I say Stephanie Meyer is a brilliant and promising author! I look forward to reading all of her future publications! I have yet to start the \\"Host\\" but am looking forward to it!  This Twi-Mom of four boys will be in line for \\"New Moon\\" and every other movie that comes from this saga!  Bravo Stephanie!!!  Keep writing!!!!!

B002EWD08Q|3.0|I didn't even know Josh Homme had produced this album and found myself thinking -- boy this is hard and riffy, much more like a Queens of the Stone Age album than an Arctic Monkeys. I love QOTSA, but for completely different reasons than I liked the Monkeys. It's an OK album but it has no energy. It sounds like they shot a whole bunch of heroin before recording. Let's hope the next one is a return to proper style.

B001AQTWF2|2.0|After watching Whitney's extensive interview with Oprah (shown on TV over 2 days), I was psyched to get this CD.  Oprah even had Whitney on her show singing \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\".  The live version on Oprah just  blew me away.  The audience stood up and cheered (as I was at home), but the CD version is pale by comparison.  I wish it could've captured Whitney's vocal magic and emotion from Oprah's show.  It's too bad we'll never get to hear the live version unless Arista is smart enough to  include it when they release the song as a Single, that is IF they decide to release the song as a single.    The one word that sticks out in my mind after multiple listens to \\"ILTY\\" is the word....SAFE.  I know Clive Davis has been orchestrating Whitney's return for the past 3 years.  He has been waiting for right time to record this CD.  \\"ILTY\\" was supposed to come out two years ago, but Arista kept waiting for Whitney, and waiting.....and waiting.  There was just too much going on in her personal life for her to make a decent CD.  I thought after Whitney recovered from all the headlines, the battles with Bobby B., the drugs, the family interventions, her slow climb out of rehab, and so on....that Whit would finally record a CD that would announce: \\"I'M BACK\\"!!    Unfortunately ILTY is NOT that CD.  The selected songs sound only marginally better than her other disappointing release, the sad 2002 \\"Just Whitney\\", which is as big of a   D U D  that Whitney ever released.  Seven years is a long wait and a lot to ask for a fan between releases.  Even Whit's loyal fans agree her once glorious instrument has been reduced to a hoarse whisper, I just wish she could've gone ALL OUT on some notes and not play it so SAFE.  Was Clive telling her not to show the rough side of her voice too much??  We'll never t know, but even with an open mind and open ears, ILTY is disappointing.  The bottom line is:  the songs just aren't that interesting.  \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" comes close and gets things going nicely as an opener, but the CD starts to lose steam as it rolls on.     I'm hoping Whit will put out another CD within two years with definitely better songs and hopefully her voice will be in better shape too.  I'm realistic to know it will never be the 1985 version of Whitney Houston we'll be getting.  EVER.  The producers just need to really find very STRONG set of songs for Whitney in her next outing (Clive, are you LISTENING??)    Now my next big moment will come in two weeks when Mariah's \\"Memoirs of An Imperfect Angel\\" hits stores.  Will \\"Mimi\\" also suffer a similiar fate after the success of \\"Emancipation....\\"  Guess we'll soon find out.
0385504225|5.0|When you've written a bunch of increasingly successful thrillers, the last one of which turns out to be a bookselling phenom, there must be an incredible amount of pressure on the follow-up.  Add in the fact that you revealed the topic of your next book by hiding clues in the jacket cover to your best-seller, giving everyone in the world the chance to guess at and try to gun-jump your thriller with their own Freemason tale, and your task becomes even harder.  Add in a few lawsuits to distract you and, just maybe, make you a bit paranoid about worrying about who will sue over the next book, and the writing gets even harder.  Add in the security necessary to keep the details secret as you progress and life is even more complicated.<br /><br />Yet, despite all this, Dan Brown has produced a new thriller that is everything that a thriller and a sequel is supposed to be.  Compelling, thrilling, familiar, yet surprising, The Lost Symbol was worth the wait and does not disappoint.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is true to the spirit and the main character of Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code, yet builds on that fictional history and notoriety.  The puzzles and symbols and and geographic mapping clues and chases we have come to know and crave are all there--mysteriously clever, yet still within grasp of the reading audience, at least when revealed (and a few before).  There is a religious overlay to add a bit of controversy and there is suspense aplenty.  Sure, you may feel that some of the page-turning attributes are a bit constructed at times, but you still want to turn those pages to find out what happens next.  There are twists and shocking surprises, I think, even bigger and better than in Dan Brown's previous books.  More importantly, far from a mindless action-thriller, The Lost Symbol imparts scads of interesting information and actively encourages you to go read interesting books and discourses and to travel to interesting places.<br /><br />Is the novel perfect?  No.  Sometimes the characters do stupid things or don't figure something out as quick as you think they should.  And the explanations by Langdon can get a bit long-winded from time to time, especially nearer the beginning of the book.  I'm also sure that websites are blossoming as we speak to quibble about this or that factoid or where some phrase or idea might have appeared before, but none of that detracts one iota from the fact that this is a tremendously interesting and compelling and educational and thought-provoking thriller that exceeds tremendously high expectations.  At times, you can even catch Brown making a bit of fun about himself and the past exploits of Langdon.<br /><br />Ignore the reviewers who nit-pick and publish spoilers and moan and groan about how the characters could have more depth or that the book is not as clever as they are, or who are obviously jealous of Dan Brown's success, but couldn't write a thriller half this good if their lives depended on it.  The Lost Symbol is not literary, it is not a character study, it is not Shakespeare.  It is an intelligent, highly readable, page-turning thriller.  I highly recommend it.ters do stupid things or don't figure something out as quick as you think they should.

B001RTP3Z0|2.0|The play list is great. The video is very good, considering that it is a largely static subject (a band on a stage). The problem is the audio: there's a constant echo. The audio engineer apparently didn't account for the amplification needed for a folk singer in a huge hall. The echo is persistent, annoying, and makes the lyrics (the main point of the performance) largely unintelligible.  I wouldn't give this DVD to anyone; I'm going to trash it.

0385504225|3.0|Purchased at the airport, I read half the book between JFK and DFW and the other half on the way home. 6 hours of reading.     This book is virtually identical to all of Dan Brown's other books -- same type of clue-to-clue storyline, Robert Langdon and his quirks back again; and bizarre science and enough esoteric fact to keep you flipping the pages wondering how much is real and how much is made up.    That being said -- you can figure out the villain within a few chapters, and you can figure out that the entire chase is one big MacGuffin to get to your conclusion. Here's the payoff: there isn't any!!! 530 pages later you have NO satisfactory conclusion. No big underlying mystery like in DiVinci Code. No big character twist like in Angels and Demons. All you get is spiritual mumbo-jumbo.    Read it. It's fast and fun. The Villain truly is a fun character, even if Robert Langdon himself has become tiresome and boring. But don't expect DiVinci Code. This is not DiVinci Code.
0143034901|5.0|I'm going to keep this short.<br /><br />Hands down one of the best books i've ever read.  I'm not the most well read person but i read about two books a month.  when i put this book down i would count the hours until i could read again.  the book is full of emotion, mystery, passion, humor, and intrigue.  it's a wonderful piece of literature and definitely a modern classic.  the time period of post civil war Spain is enthralling.  very rarely have i read books or seen movies that take place during this era.  it's dark, mysterious, tragic, and beautiful.  the Characters make you laugh, cry, scream out, and you long to learn more about them.<br /><br />this book is wonderful and i'm jealous of the people who will read it for the first time.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Hopkins is great, as usual, playing his typical psycho, though Ryan Gosling as the young prosecutor is maybe a little too young for the role. Some great plot devices, but the finale is a bit of a let down. You could do worse.
B002KLAL4W|5.0|First off, I will let you know that I am biased in the fact that PJ is my favorite band of all time and I love all of their stuff.  This album is great.  The guys seem to be evolving and moving in a different direction with each album.  The one thing that I love, (and that others seem to hate because they say \\"when is Pearl Jam going to equal the material that they put out on Ten)?, is that these guys progress musically and experiment, rather than rehashing old material.  Each of their albums is excellent in the fact that they are willing to try something new.  Sure, there are straight forward facemelters on Backspacer along with slow songs (I refuse to call any of PJ's songs ballads), but that is to be expected from a rock band.  That is what they do.  The thing is, they are different than the ones that were on Ten or Yield or Riot Act etc.   That is great in my opinion.  The sonics and reverb used on Backspacer is great.  The percussion and bass is just right.  The vocals and lyrics are awesome. All around this is a great album.  And if these dudes don't win some kind of award for packaging, something is wrong with society in general.  Overall, Magnificent.  Peace and Love,  Jake
0385504225|1.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and I enjoy the way he writes and tells the story, the books progress as if we're watching a movie unfold, and I like that.<br />The Lost Symbol however, should be renamed Lost Patience, a word that will change the world? Come on! Give me a break. Wasting hundreds of pages do decrypt a pyramid full of secret codes, only to find out about a word, a symbol, the Washington Monument, and the potential of the human mind. Are you serious?<br />The Lost Symbol is like a bad sequel that should never have hit the theaters.
0060849827|5.0|As a survival guide, this is hard to beat. However, it is tiny in size and very small print. If you want to read it and learn from it, I recommend you buy the larger format edition by the same author - cover looks dark green with white letters. Get that one first. This is the tiny pocket edition, which fits in a small Ziploc sandwich bag :) I bought a couple, to keep in the car and when hiking and traveling.

B000002BYD|5.0|It seems half the world has ADHD and can barely spend 45 minutes listening to one of the greatest singer songwriters of our time lay his soul and psyche bare album after album. What other band out there delivers this much diversity, raw energy, honesty and melody so consistently? Do the people rating this a 1 or a 2 even have their speakers plugged in correctly?    I know it is only fair to compare a band or even a human being to what they were the day before but the Ten and Vs. comparisons were tired in 1994 and they are even more tired 15 years later. Imagine a new band released Yield in 1998 or even today. Given to Fly Wishlist, Do the Evolution, In Hiding - all would be in nonstop rotation on rock radio and be considered classics if this was the band's first LP. Instead the only songs that linger on the radio from PJ are from Ten and Vs. with Betterman thrown in as the lone post mega-popularity concession. Without the name Pearl Jam and the heavy weight it carries this album would have sold way more copies. I guess this is true of a lot of bands after they have passed their peak in fame who are still producing quality work.    As with most Pearl Jam albums released after Vs. this one needs a couple listens for proper appreciation. Highly recommended!
0545123267|4.0|Ever since being attacked by wolves as a little girl Grace has felt drawn to the wolves. But one wolf in particular really stands out for her. It's those yellow eyes. She even calls him - her wolf. Sam, the boy with the yellow eyes. Lives two lives. One where he is protected by a pack, and lives in the forest with other wolves. Then the few months of the summer when he is able to change back into a human. He's watched Grace every winter. She became a type of silent friend to him, and when Sam finds himself in trouble during the cold of winter, he turns to Grace for help. With Grace at his side he must fight to stay human, and that means keeping his body temperature high enough in the cold chill of winter.<br /><br />Shiver, to me, was more a love story than a paranormal tale. Of course it has it's paranormal elements, but mostly it's about two teens who are meant to be together. They both know it, but there doesn't seem to be anything to change what Sam is, and what he changes into when it gets cold. I thought Shiver was a really good story, and I enjoyed it immensely. Even when Stiefvater made me get all teary. I like the spin on werewolves, how they eventually just stay in their wolf forms forever is a fresh and interesting take.<br /><br />I think this is a great pick for anyone who enjoys diving into a good love story, and if you like a little paranormal with your romance then it's there for you.

159562015X|5.0|I thought this was just another one of those boring business books.  It's NOT!  When you buy the book, you get an access code and take this test.  After you take the test, you are told what your top 5 strengths are.  It's insane how accurate the results are.  Not only do you find out what your strengths are, but you also find out how to utilize those strengths to better your life.  My boss and I took this together and I truly believe we have a better understanding of each other and since then have worked more efficiently.  It's not all puppies and rainbows either, you may have to take some constructive criticism, however, everything in this book is truthful and extremely useful.  Enjoy!

B002FOQY04|5.0|Well as if any of the other reviews didn't say it already, this album is must own if you're a fan of hip hop, pop or weird music. Well, that's unless you don't like his style.   Besides that though, very strong debut for the Cudder. Some songs are very electro, other's more west coast chill. There's a lot to go around, and after a roughly nonstop run of listening to the album, I'm sure that most people will be in awe at the awesomeness. Yes he's not the most amazing lyricist, and some stuff may translate to what we call as \\"emo angst\\" stuff in rap form. It is the \\"soundtrack to my life\\" to him, so therefore it's expected to forgoes all the hoes and cash and bling and sticks to remembering his late Father, being picked on and his desires for the future. This is one of those albums that you aren't afraid to turn up in your car yet has that personal feeling that you can listen to them on your cans/headphones while in your room thinking about life or smoking some type of hallucinogenic or just eating ice cream and drinking soda lol. Seriously though, haven't bought an album in a long while, but even I knew this deserved to be purchased in physical form.    PS- the cd's in the deluxe edition are awesome, starry skies. Probably the same for the solo disc edition.      PSS- where's the damn bonus tracks Motown/G.O.O.D. records?      Best songs so far-Simple As...,Alive, Soundtrack to my life, Hyyerr, Enter Galactic. (Besides the obvious Day N' Nite and \\"Poke-Her-Face\\")

0307389839|1.0|Absolutely the worst book ever written by a (formerly)major writer. Honestly, it is incredible that someone could possibly have been paid to \\"write\\" this 180-page scribble. But then publishing is like the Mob: once you're in, you're in. (Or you're dead.)    Open a page, any page. Page 24:    \\"It's August 14th, a Sunday. This morning I ran an hour and fifteen minutes listening to Carla Thomas and Otis Redding on my MD player. In the afternoon I swam 1,400 yards at the pool and in the evening swam at the beach. And after that I had dinner--beer and fish--at the Hanalea Dolphin Restaurant just outside the town of Hanalea. [Really?] The dish I have is walu, a kind of white fish. They grill it for me over charcoal, and I eat it with soy sauce. The side dish is vegetable kababs, plus a large salad.\\"    No desert?    Page 139:    \\"There were torrential rains in parts of [Japan], and a lot of people died. They say it's all because of global warming. Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. Some experts claim it is, some claim it isn't. There's some proof that it is, some proof that it isn't. But still people say that most of the problems the earth is facing are, more or less, due to global warming. When sales of apparel go down, when tons of driftwood wash up on the shore, when there are floods and droughts, when consumer prices go up, most of the fault is scribed to global warming. What the world needs is a set villain that people can point at and say, 'It's all your fault!'\\"    Wow. If only Karl Marx had such understanding.    88:    \\"Young girls in revealing bikinis are sunbathing in beach towels, listening to their Walkmen or iPods. An ice cream van stops and sets up shop.

SinceMurakami, long ago, stopped being able to perceive anyone beyond his or her Yuppie externals, how interesting. As Truman Capote once said of Kerouac \\"This isn't writing. It's typing.\\"    And this, from page 99:    \\"If possible, I'd like to avoid ... literary burnout. My idea of literature is something more spontaneous, more cohesive, something with a kind of natural, positive vitality. For me, writing a novel is like climbing a mountain, struggling up the face of the cliff, reaching the summit after a long and arduous ordeal. . . That's my aim as a novelist. And besides, at this point I don't have the leisure to be burned out. Which is exactly why even though people say 'He's no artist,' I keep on running.\\"    Literary burnout?? This guy's become a cross between one of Billy Crystal's writing students in \\"Throw Momma from the Train\\" and John Cassavetes at the end of \\"The Fury\\". Burnout? How about an explosion from within?    What happened? For me, \\"Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\\" not only remains one of the great late-20th Century novels, but one of most important books for me privately. I was lucky enough to find it(or it found me) during a time of brutal divorce. I read the book three times and it really did help me to grieve. And there are other lovely achievements: \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\", \\"South of the Border\\" and the short story masterpiece \\"Tony Takitani\\". I think what happened to Murakami is right here in this flyspeck of a running book: the man revels in his own navel-gazing narcissism. Has there been a writer as in love with his own thought process as Murakami evidently is? Okay, sure: Mailer, Miller, Lawrence, Henry James, Simone Weil, Goethe. But in Murakami's case, we're talking about a meatball mind. The man seems to be very hip to the notion that one must push one's strengths and forget about what one was not blessed with. And when his beautiful craft and strangeness carried the day, he produced beautiful things. Since things began to fall apart at about the same time he became a Big Time Literary Celebrity, whatever balance he once had between the unconscious magic of creation and his own \\"ideas\\" was trashed. And trash is what he's produced since.    But he sure knows his audience -- as self-involved and as incapable(or unwilling) to engage something outside themselves as is Murakami. He knows the happiness or sadness of every muscle in his body. Yet what about fatherhood, Haru-san? You've been married to the same lovely devoted woman since you were both in college, and you have all the yen in the world. Where are your children? Instead of wasting time on 62-mile Ubermarathons, try helping the poor. Try fighting in a war. Maybe try homelessness for a month, sort of a modern day \\"Sullivan's Travels\\". Prison helps the soul, so they say. Try it.    Anything. But stop eating your damn walu.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I don't write many reviews, and by the time I write one, there are usually hundreds ahead of me, so I don't guess many will read this...BUT I had to write something after hearing this box set.<br /><br />I'm 57 and grew up with the Beatles, and I've always been a STEREO man, liked the different sounds from different speakers (still do, by the way).  After reading James N. Perlman's review, I broke down and bought the mono box set--after getting the stereo set.  I like the stereo set, but I am enthralled with the mono set!<br /><br />I'm a drummer, and though Ringo wasn't the most accomplished, he played tastefully (better than Paul who rushed the tempo on Dear Prudence during his fills--though I give full credos to Paul for being a very good drummer).  I can hear every stroke of Ringo's cymbal work.  A lot of time, I'd hear his cymbals in the background, but it sounded like one sound, not individual licks.  His work on Long Tall Sally is gorgeous.  I even hear bass drum work that I'd missed before, in step with Paul on bass.<br /><br />I always figured with the same sound coming from every speaker (mono) that the sound would be less defined and boring.  What a mistake!  The sounds are clear, detailed, and the high end is wonderful.  The stereo set is very good:  still love that old separation from the 60s, but James N. Perlman has it right in the comparison.  My two cents(worth even less today...) :-)

I love that Mad Men is full of surprises and you really never know what to expect in the world of Sterling Cooper. I highly recommend this show, and owning it on dvd is the only way to watch it.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Some scenes (e.g. pregnant women drinking and smoking, misogynistic attitudes being mainstream and acceptable) are offensive to modern tastes, but this is an amazingly period correct well-written, well-cast, well-directed and well-acted show.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|I have not read the original books by J. K. Rowling, so my review of the sixth Harry Potter film is purely based on my experience of seeing the film alone, not comparing the adaptation with the original. And my simple impression is this; Harry Potter needs a new director. OK, I know it is too late, but I believe I am not the only one who feels that way about the latest entry.    As you know, there is one crucial episode involving major character(s) at the end of \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\\" Remember, before you actually see this fairly engrossing climax, you have to wait very long. I know the sixth installment of Harry Potter series has to lay the groundwork for the two-film finale - \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I\\" and \\"Part II\\" - so the film's long running time (153 minutes) is understandable. Still, the wait is very long.    That is because the filmmakers have no idea how to create a compelling narrative. Director David Yeats handles everything in the complicated interactions between characters surrounding Harry as if making a series of formulaic TV shows. The film goes on and on, but doesn't know where it should go. The suspense is half-hearted at best and the film fails to build up any tension toward the climax. The romances of Harry, Ron and Hermione are told without style or nuance. As to the titular \\"Prince\\" it seems they forget this should be one of the key elements that play an important role at this entry's ending. But what should I expect from the director who in the previous Harry Potter film wasted brilliant Gary Oldman and his intriguing character Sirius Black in such a horrible way?    I am not saying \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is a terrible disaster. It is not. With the first-rate actors, first-rate production designs (Hogwarts are so beautiful) and first-rate effects, it cannot be. Still this is the weakest link of the series, and I am afraid it is not because of the book itself.

0385504225|4.0|Oh, Dan Brown wrote the other two Langdon books, and it was a Nicholas Cage movie where people were rushing around D.C. looking for clues.<br /><br />All the expositional science read like Michael Crichton, and the short chapter read like James Patterson.<br /><br />And the Masons have something to do with it? Read that before also.<br /><br />Regardless, it took me only a few days to read this book (even with taking time out to devour The Golden City since that was a library book). Dan Brown has become a franchise like James Bond; you know exactly what kind of villains there will be, you know that Q will give James all sorts of cool doohickeys, and you know that James Bond will sort it all out without stirring his martini. And that you will enjoy it no matter how cheesy.<br /><br />This book got the four stars because it was just what I expected, and I still enjoyed the heck out of it.<br /><br />5/23/13 - Just reread this because I read most of it under the influence of a sleep medication, and forgot most of it. Today I would give it five stars because it didn't seem like a reread of his first two Robert Langdon books. It hit the ground running and didn't stop until right before the end. Even though the end was a letdown, I still really enjoyed it. Is it factual? Who cares!<br /><br />Okay now I am ready for the new Robert Langdon book where he gets to run around Florence.

0451217403|3.0|This book though very realistically written, seeks to immortalize criminals. The book consistently glorifies outlaws and their unbridled violence. A book that is otherwise a masterpiece, fails to be classed as one, because of its immoral core. It almost appears as if this book is a propaganda mouthpiece for the Mafia. There is no mention of any significant success of the law enforcement. Murders are committed as if there is no law. In this context this novel to some degree, even loses its claim to realism. Wrongs are righted and criminal intentions are ennobled by twisted logic. It is as if the thugs operate in a utopian thuggee dreamland with no strings attached.   A totally negative view of civilization and its institutions are taken. The book achieved its crooked aims by inspiring awe and misplaced veneration for crime in the minds of it's readers, especially the gullible and the easily misdirected youngsters. To this extent , this book has sought to undermine the civil fabric of society.     On the positive side this book has provided some remarkable insights into the criminal mob mind. A narrow slice of the mob world , the Sicilian kind, has been brilliantly portrayed. Every page sizzles with action and suspense.   The story of men who live by the sword and die by the sword ofcourse, the sword is not of the law but of the like-minded mobsters. This book has become a part of the American folklore for the above reasons.     All in all, the book seems to say : that every American organization is a mob peopled by criminals, be it the government or a corporation, only that the Sicilian Mafia is too good at its business. Let the government and the entire society be taken over by the Mafia and that will be only good. The book just stops short of saying that. Thus this book voices the aspirations and dreams of the most disgruntled and frustrated elements of the society.      If this reviewer could be called naive for the above review, he doesnt mind and he hopes to keep alive in his heart the torch of triumph of the law over criminals.
0553260111|3.0|Finished last night (21 Sept, 2009).   I received this as a gift. The movie is one of my favorites.  It was interesting but predictable. Ok I was reading this while watching Monday night football. This book was the basis for the movie. It takes place in the mid seventies. I might have been more interested in this book if I didn't realize that Bourne doesn't get killed. Also, there are 3 or four more books written by Ludlum that revolve around Bourne. I found this theme to be already used by many other authors. Maybe Ludlum was the first to use it or i just read some others that seemed to be better. I am fond of Detective novel & murder mysteries.  I will move on to some other books I have at home to read. I am not really impressed with this book. I have other genres of books that I want to finish.

It is important when reading this book to pay particular attention to the text and accompanying graphs or formulas. There are several typographical errors which a good reader should be able to pick up quite easily. I can strongly recommend this book.
1575666286|1.0|When someone in your life was suffering, you'd like to get any info that could heal them. That's why we got this book in the first place. But there was nothing new here, eat vegetables, stay away from salt and sodium, etc.<br /><br />There are a few nuances though, such as stay away from dairy products, soy products, avocados, cucumbers, beans--I always felt that you can't go wrong when you go with nature and eat what nature has provided, so these no-no's did not make sense, especially when you're trying to increase the immune system.<br /><br />They also wanted that you overcook your vegetables--this too did not ring true for me.<br /><br />If these ring true to you, they you'd probably like this book. If it didn't, then don't get this book.
0385504225|3.0|what I expected and why I like Dan Brown novels. I did not find this to be the furious page turner of the Angels and Demons nor as controversial as the DaVinci Code. So I wondered what I was expecting. After thinking about it, I realized that the DVC and Angels and Demons were poking at perceived bullies and flawed institutions. The idea of hidden wisdom and knowledge being suppressed was in and of itself exciting and provocative. In the Lost Symbol, Dan Brown has changed the playing field. The evil is more remote and detached from our everyday experience and the tone is more pro-institutional (the institution being the Masons). All the normal hooks are there that send you to wikipedia to see if that is really true. However, his message was somewhat obscured. But still insightful and interesting. The last 25 pages of the book were to me this most insightful. I sense Mr. Brown believes we are in monumental, troubled times. His message is one that we need wisdom, not just knowledge. Knowledge, depending upon the mindset behind its use, can either create or destroy. I sense this is his plea to take the time to assess where we are (knowledge hidden from many who accept \\"conventional wisdoms and media sources) learn from history and change our course. Many who are looking for the riveting thriller may be disappointed. As for me, I think I'll go out and look at the stars tonight and ponder how I can be a part of change.

B000O77QD8|3.0|With only a few reservations, I have to say I was reasonably impressed with this Clint Eastwood creation that documents the life stories of the men who raised the American flag at The Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. I thought they did a convincing job of showing us how facts and reality can be so liquid, how the government and military tries to manipulate the public and, ultimately, how the public so craves certain icons--heroes to hold high on their shoulders, worthy of such status or not--that they're willing to believe whatever they're sold. The war scenes I found brutally effective and gripping, something you just kind of sit there and absorb in a trance, vaguely thankful that the path of your life has never taken you there. I was also struck by the casual, accepted racism towards the Native American Ira Hayes. What a different world it was then, worse in many ways, but so much better in others as well. Using a cast of relative no-name actors also added to the overall effect for me; rarely was I thinking, Oh I remember him from some other movie or TV show. I did feel it dragged on at the end, getting perhaps overly sentimental with certain aspects. But still, I liked it overall. And the photo sequence that ran during the credits that was capped off by a film shot from the memorial on Iwo Jima today was a fitting touch to end on.
B002L1BJHY|3.0|Like most Jet fans, I thought Get Born was awesome.  Then Shine On came out and I was kind of like whatever.  It was a good CD but there just wasn't enough riffing going on in my opinion.  Then came this album, Shaka Rock.  This is the music that Jet fans like hearing them make.  With basically only one \\"ballad\\" type song, She Holds a Grudge, this generally pretty straight up rock and roll.  Some of the stand outs are obviously She's A Genius, Black Hearts (one of my new favorite Jet songs), Let Me Out, and Start The Show.  Then you get to the obvious flaw of the album, the lyrics.  Some of them are pretty horrendous but it shouldn't be surprising to fans that they aren't writing anything groundbreaking.  If you can get past that, I think this is a fun album overall.  Nothing special, but good.

B00004YRQA|5.0|The memory card is a bastion of time, allowing a player of games to store the time they've spent and preserve it... it's difficult to actually write a review for this thing. It functions as it should, and that's really all there is to it.
B000FJGWBM|5.0|Guy Pearce stars as Leonard, a man who's lost his short-term memory and uses notes and tattoos to help him hunt down the man who murdered his wife. From the first minute of this thing I was hooked, held in trance for two hours until it ended...or should I say began? Employing a relatively unique approach to storytelling in a movie, Memento begins at the end and then works slowly backwards, kind of taking two steps back for every step forward. While initially somewhat disconcerting, it's eventually revealed to be a wondrously effective method that, to an extent, mirrors some of the confusion felt by Leonard. Because Leonard forgets information he knew the day before or even minutes before, the backward storytelling mechanism is able to function effectively for us, as information he knew at the beginning of events is not revealed to us until the end. Leonard's condition resultant from a head injury he suffered trying to save his wife--he writes everything down. However, his memories from before the incident are mostly intact, something that is both curse and blessing as memories of his lost wife--his lost life--torment and drive him. He prints notations on Kodak snapshots to retain photographic evidence for himself of, for example, which car is his, which hotel he's staying at, the people he knows--both the ones he believes are helping him and the ones he believes are not. The most crucial information he has tattooed on his body, and his entire body is crosshatched with inked information--clues to remember what has happened, what he's doing, vital information on the suspect he's pursuing--the most chilling of which is written backwards on his chest so he can read it in the mirror. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss have absolutely killer roles and performances as supporting characters, and Guy Pearce's portrayal of Leonard is convincing beyond all measure. I was edge-of-the-couch engrossed in this, itching to find out what was what, who was who, and the twisting revelations gradually revealed along the way never ceased to intrigue and affect me. Good stuff.lations gradually revealed along the way never ceased to intrigue and affect me. Good stuff.

B002CLBJPK|4.0|\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is one of my favorite Disney films. Yes, I know it's not \\"Mary Poppins,\\" but as Leonard Maltin wrote in æThe Disney Films,\\" it's not fair to make comparisons -- though it's inevitable considering the creative people involved: songs by the Sherman brothers conducted by Irwin Kostal; screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi and direction by Robert Stevenson.<br /><br />Walt Disney was somewhat involved with Bedknobs, as he had bought the rights to the books by Mary Norton (\\"The Borrowers\\"), upon which the film was based as a backup, in case the prickly P. L. Travers blew up negotiations for her \\"Poppins\\" books. The song, \\"The Beautiful Briny\\" was even written for a proposed \\"Poppins\\" sequence that never made it to final script.<br /><br />This large-scale extravaganza certainly deserves more respect and attention than is usually afforded it. What \\"Bedknobs\\" has going for it is a sharper story direction than Poppins. Even though there are some detours along the way, such as the Portobello Street Dance, everything serves the central focus of Miss Price's use of magic to stave off Nazi invaders. Of course, that storyline itself, an invention of the screenwriters and not in the books, can be considered off-putting by some, including Angela Lansbury, who in the outstanding Sherman brothers documentary feature, The Boys, expresses embarrassment of sorts that the comedic battle at the end trivializes World War II, especially after discovering Robert Sherman's physical and mental suffering as a result of the horrors of Nazi atrocities.<br /><br />Lansbury has rarely expressed a distinct enthusiasm for \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" except on rare occasions such as when the film was restored as much as possible to its intended length (it was edited severely both in 1971 and 1979). Reportedly, she clashed with director Stevenson over the approach to Miss Price's character (apparently she did not find him to be an \\"actor's director\\"). Her house had burned down at the time and she was having family issues. Plus, her dream of achieving the same kind of musical comedy success in the movies as she did on Broadway as Mame did not happen with this film, especially since her song and dance number was cut so Radio City Music Hall would have more showings per day.<br /><br />The Disney studio was also in a state of flux when \\"Bedknobs\\" was produced and Walt's leadership and creative decision making shows most in \\"big\\" movies like this and \\"Pete's Dragon.\\" But all things considered, \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is still an excellent, entertaining family film with fine songs and a great cast (whom we get to see more of thanks to the restored footage).<br /><br />For some reason, the new \\"Enchanted Musical Edition\\" DVD seems to have less special material than the 30th Anniversary Edition that preceded it. A new \\"making of\\" feature starring \\"Wizards of Waverly Place's\\" Jennifer Stone actually goes into less detail about the special effects than the one on the recent \\"Pete's Dragon\\" DVD release. There is no commentary and no new musical material on the \\"Bedknobs\\" DVD, even though it's called an \\"Enchanted Musical Edition.\\" (There were alternate versions of songs and demos that might have been nice.) Plus, in the \\"Step in the Right Direction\\" feature, the prologue refers to the laserdisc version from which it came.<br /><br />If you don't already have \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks,\\" it's nice that this edition is available and reissues like this keep great films in the public eye.

0385504225|4.0|*Simply a review of why I liked it, not another rehashing of the story*<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book.  I'm a fan of Dan Brown because he knows how to TELL a story.  I could care less about the controversy he imbues, what religious group he's pissed off, or what he may or may not believe.  Do his stories deserve my attention?  Can his stories keep my attention?  Will I remember his stories after I'm done reading his stories?  My answer to all three is 'yes'.  Yeah, I admit... I got caught up in the hype of Dan Brown mania, but I've read his other books so it was a pretty safe bet that this one would be good.  It was.  If there was one word that I would use to describe how I felt as I was reading this book; it would be 'fun'.  I felt fun, I felt like a verb.  Crazy?  Probably, but a good book will do that to you.<br /><br />It kept me up at night, I took longer breaks at work than I should have, I coordinated my reading with eating non-messy foods so I wouldn't have to stop, heck I even stopped reading my collection of short stories by Allison Tyler.  I enjoy reading books that are fun because I read to be entertained.  'The Lost Symbol' is pure entertainment.  Dan Brown writes in a way that you, literally, have to force yourself to stop and go have a life because if you wait and say, \\"oh, I'll stop after this chapter\\", you will never get up.  It's a roller coaster of words, this book, and I certaintly enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />I loved reading about the Masons, which Presidents were Masons, WHO in history was a Mason, the Astrological elements of Washington D.C., secrets hidden in plain sight, Noetic Science (really.  This exists... really?).  I shook with hatred for Sato, and Mal'akh... is there another character in literature (recent) who exudes so much evil?  The worst kind of evil tu boot.  The worst meaning; he has the means, opportunity, and the black desire to pull off his plan.  And NOTHING is going to stop him.  He's a murderous, fundamentalist Terminator.  He will not be stopped, he will not be deterred, and everything... everything has a plan.  It grates me to read about characters this evil but Dan has that ability to make them just a (super tiny) tad bit likeable.<br /><br />So why didn't I give this book five stars?  The ending.  It had nothing to do with me agreeing with it, offended by it, or anything dumb like that.  It was just... not good.  I mean 500 pages of an enthralling story only to get to the end, find out the secret, and then... fizzle.  Every single one of Brown's books have led me, right up to the last page, with a Mach 8 ending.  Except for this one.  I think that is one reason it's getting such bad press.  It's like having a good meal of steak, lobster, and shrimp, only to get a tootsie roll for desert.  The question is, would I read this book if I knew what I know now about the ending?  Yes I would.  I'm not going to miss out on a slammin' steak and lobster dinner just because the desert isn't good.  Next time I'll just skip the desert.  :-)t be stopped, he will not be deterred, and everything... everything has a plan.

B001MS7IBS|4.0|J.J. Abrams is well known in TV land for crafting superb stories that involve action, dramatic plot twists and usually great characters.  Fringe is his latest contraption, a kind of mix of the strange cases of X-Files, Outer Limits and/or The Twilight Zone and recent procedural shows like CSI.  Straying from his last hit show, Lost, Abrams decided to take a more episodic route by crafting a story that has a strong meta-story but is also done in bite-sized pieces where, unlike his superior show Lost, a viewer could miss a handful of shows and still have a hold on the story.  Fringe started on somewhat shaky ground, with uneven episodes that struggled to find its niche.  Much like another sci-fi influenced show on Fox that was created by another famous TV creator (i.e. Dollhouse), Fringe doesn't really hit its stride until about halfway through the season.  But when it does, it definitely far outmatched Dollhouse and crafted a show that had me eager for season two to begin.      The three main characters are at the heart of Fringe:  special agent Olivia Dunham, mad scientist and just plain kook Walter Bishop and Walter's son and professed \\"jack of all trades,\\" Peter Bishop.  In the pilot episode, these three characters are unceremoniously thrust together and form a shaky union.  Olivia needs Walter's immense knowledge of what's going on, but Walter resides in an asylum and seems to be barely functioning.  The only way he can be released is if it's into the care of a family member.  Enter Peter Bishop, who ends up being wrangled into this whole mess.  These characters have a lot of life and their personalities clash and complement each other in a humorous way.  Walter, in particular, offers much of Fringe's humor with his oftentimes strange demands, his eccentric and fast changes of thought and his outlook on life.      Each episode, meanwhile, is laid out much like other procedural shows (albeit with a supernatural/sci-fi twist) where something happens that causes theFringe Division, as it's called, to be called in as a cleanup crew and to figure out why and how it happened.  So, episodes will delve into rare diseases, chimeras, psychic abilities, spontaneous combustion, teleportation, rapid aging, etc.  Meanwhile, there is the aforementioned meta-story that begins to unfold, tying everything together as \\"The Pattern.\\"  Unfortunately, for the first half of the season, the entire story is pretty stagnant and I was afraid Fringe would be more in line with the CSIs of the world and less with establishing a strong background mythos.  Luckily, Abrams cranked up the story a few notches and you start to realize that, while each episode stands on their own, they are also intricately connected to one another.      As the first season hurtles toward its end, Abrams throws a couple Lost-style curveballs into the mix and the finale has more than a few revelations which really spice up the story and provide clues for what the next season has in store.  Ultimately, Fringe succeeded in hooking me and, with season two already airing, I've fallen for the show.  If you're at all interested, I'd definitely recommend giving season one a chance.  It's one of the better new shows and so far it seems to only be getting better.      Oh and it looks great on Blu Ray.  Details are outstanding.  There's some grain but it's never distracting and a definite step up from the HD TV version.  From an aural perspective, it's decent; Warner Bros includes a good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track but no TrueHD track.  It still sounds terrific and for the majority of HD enthusiasts, it won't even matter or be noticed.  But it's unfortunate that the majority of Warner Brothers releases don't include much for audiophiles.  Still, a worthy upgrade over DVD and the television version.

B00001OH7G|5.0|The definitive rock & roll statement if ever there was one, \\"Irish Tour\\" is Rory Gallagher at his peak, playing before his home town, one crowd pleaser after another. Smokin',powerful performances of some of his best solo tunes up to that time in 1974. You can hear the fire burning inside him through his masterful guitar playing, the passionate fury in his vocals, hell- this is what rock & roll is all about! I dare anyone to listen to this without wanting to crank it up and wake the neighbors! Hell, you can't do it. Rory & his great band- Rod D'Ath on drums, Gerry McAvoy, long time bassist, & Lou Martin, keyboards, kick it out and blow the roof off! Sorry, I can't think of anything but old tired cliches to describe the performances here- but they really do apply. It's just impossible to select any favorite cut from this- \\"Cradle Rock\\" possibly (the definitive version), but then there's \\"Tatoo'd Lady\\" (brilliant), \\"I Wonder Who\\" (blues rocker), \\"Walkin On Hot Coals\\" (wow- check out how he plays lead & rhythm guitar simultaneously- true genius!), \\"Who's That Comin'\\" (more in your face guitar mastery). If you don't believe me, check out the other glowing reviews- these people aren't lying to ya. The last tune, \\"Back on My Stompin' Grounds\\" (blues slide guitar played to perfection)is from the rehearsal for the show, but it blows away the studio version completely IMO. Just get it already- and crank this sucker!

The book is divided into three sections: 1)Create the story. 2)Deliver the experience. 3)Refine and rehearse. The material lacks direct input from Jobs, is overly fawning vs. Jobs, and is somewhat repetitive. Nonetheless, given the importance of the topic and the value of the material, the book is well worth reading.

8186336141|5.0|I was happy to come across this book and even happier when I saw the magnificent reviews for it. I have never come across a Yoga book that had a universal appeal and a great love for the work. I decided to purchase myself a copy and join in on the wonders of this book. I am not dissapointed at all. I am extremely happy about the content shared here in this one book.<br /><br />In my years of Yogic study I have found info. on energy work, pranic exercises here, there and everywhere. Still, I lacked the knowledge to full grasp what this program is all about. I have mounds of dvd's and books, and paperwork on pranic/energy healing. Still, I could not feel satisfied. So much was missing.<br /><br />This book has a world of life changing information in it for everyone who practices Yoga. It is very well written and explained, very well formatted (has a very easy to follow system) and includes all of the benefits of getting your many layers healthy. All of the vital information we need to restore ourselves to balance can be found here. A great curriculum.<br /><br />While reading the book, I realized that my search, on how to attain peace within all levels of my self, had finally ended. I did several of the pawanmuktasana exercises and really felt an opening of the energies of my lower body.<br /><br />This book is so simple. Yet, it bestows on the practioner, peace, vitality, renewal of self and self strength. Only once have I did this and I feel safe within myself already. Thanks to Swami Satyananda Saraswati, his knowledge and his following teachers.<br /><br />I am sure that this book will remain with me for a very long time, making it part of my practice to better health. I do not think anyone will have any negative feelings or experiences with this book. It is not to take over your spiritual or religious beliefs but to be used in tandem with it to enhance your bond with the higher energies/source (God; Buddha; etc.) that moves us all.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to those who are on this path, but hesitate to purchase it. We can only enhance our life experience.<br /><br />Take Care and May we all find our way...te to purchase it. We can only enhance our life experience.    Take Care and May we all find our way...
0385504225|1.0|I had this one figured out about one third into the book.  The bad guy way too cartoonish.  At first, the academic stuff is interesting, but then becomes literally a space filler, serving no other purpose than to make the book longer.  A cacophony of conspiracy theories, leading to a \\"great\\" mystery, that is, of course, a major letdown.  Traps, hidden meanings and obfuscation that take a serious leap of faith that authorities ignore normal protocols in order to fit lame plot twists.    I really like the Da Vinci Code, and I did like Angels and Demons, up until the part where Langdon jumps from the Helicopter.  This is a stupid book, that may hold some suspense for very gullible people.  I am severely disappointed, and am sorry I wasted the purchase price.  Avoid this at all peril.  If you are unfortunate, and did purchase this, as soon as you figure out the major plot twist (should be in the first third of the book), go look up the plot summary on Wiki, and realize that you are smarter than Dan Brown.  This book insulted my intelligence.

This book starts out slow by broaching the subject of Freemasons and the power they hold in the U.S. Then it quickly develops into a chase and riddle solving game, which at every turn produces an unsatisfying result showing us how desperate Brown was to follow up his success of The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Now that I've wasted 10 hours of my life reading this, I'm tempted never to return to this thriller genre of Brown/Patterson/Cook/Koontz and the other mediocre misfits. Sigh, I wish Chrichton were still alive to show these guys how to write a real novel. I'm not even going to bother with the movie (sorry Tom Hanks, you're great but this book sucks), this book was so dull.
0385504225|5.0|This book is not only intellectually inspiring but also speaks out the deep explaination towards many sensitive topics. Good job, Dan Brown! I highly recommend the fans of Dan Brown to read this book which is worth the effort and your bucks! The best quote I like is \\"Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand.\\" This I believe has something to do with religious prejudice. Anyway, it is another surpirse from the author of Angels and Demons.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved both Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code and couldn't wait to read the next installment. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I had such a hard time putting it down at night. Wonderful follow up to Da Vinci Code.
1416594787|2.0|I'm quite charmed at the way old man Dawkins rants and raves and gets all tangential at the drop of the hat. Funny guy. As a dinner guest, he would undoubtedly make for an entertaining evening. His arguments for evolution, on the other hand, don't hold up too well in light of today's scientific data. He conveniently avoids Intelligent Design, which is a shame.  That was a gaping hole that I would have loved to see filled. Also, recent scientific evidence has proven that all mankind has one common ancestor, the New Eve they call her. She is a 60,000-year-old female. Why is that too avoided here? I'm sure Ricky knows all about her. To boot, show me the medium-necked giraffe. It should be there somewhere in the fossil record. Why isn't it? Well, I think we all know why. Because evolution, the jumping from one species to another (as opposed to adaptation, penguins and ostriches for example) is merely bad science.

0385504225|4.0|\\"The Lost Symbol\\" is another fast paced intellectual rollercoaster through the world of symbology with Harvard Professor Robert Langdon in the front car. There are many similarities between this book and each of his previous books as there is a thriller-type chase for hidden/lost information with codes and puzzles leading Langdon to the next step. As with the others, there is a clearly defined villian who keeps the reader at the edge of his seat, fearful that evil will prevail. As a thriller, this book accomplishes the goal of creating suspense, challenging the reader's expectations, and making it difficult for the reader to put the book down (or making it imperitive to get back to the book!). However, this book is bogged down at various times by the intellectual lectures of Langdon and other characters versed in Masonic history or the pseudo-religious/historical psychotic ramblings of the villian. These parts slowed down the story and I found myself, as the reader, skimming through a bit, trying to keep up with the main historical points but racing forward to the action. Seriously, this book could have used a lot of editing, cutting out whole sections of religious/philosophical discussion and preaching? about the lost meaning of the bible. It appeared that Brown had an agenda in mind about how those who have focused on the literal translation of the bible have been lost to see the gestalt of God's intentions. Anyhow, the book is definately worth reading and no doubt will make a fun and interesting movie, as it takes place entirely in Washington DC, incorporates many of the historical monuments and buildings, and leaves the reader more knowledgable about the history and integrated perspectives of the Masons and founding fathers of the United States.

However, just because Enzo is a dog, does not mean that he is limited in his perspectives. Indeed, Enzo, in his long experiences from learning from cable television and years of watching car racing on tv, has become quite philisophical about the meaning of love, family, and the need to keep your eyes on the track while you are running the race of your life. This was an enjoyable though sad book that chronicles how Enzo's loving family life is broken apart when his owner's wife is struck with cancer and allegations are made about his fitness as a father. Enzo becomes a witness to the pain that ensues and can offer little more than his camaraderie and clever wits to assist Denny in running the long race. After all, gestures are all that he has...
B00004IC9G|5.0|I remember when this first came out on vinyl.  What a Great sound.  The songs were very easy to like.  DeMaio's writing is BRILLIANT!!!  They have always released GREAT albums.  ManOwaR is very true to their beliefs and have worked very hard, and it has certainly paid off.  It is too bad that the United States does not recognize a true talented band that was born in the heart of upstate New York!<br /><br />Hail and Kill!
B00011CZRE|5.0|I first seen this movie with one of my aunts, and this is probably the second best maniac thriller ever made. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give great performances as two police detectives tracking down a psycho killer who bases his murders on the seven deadly sins. Kevin Spacey's performance as the killer may be a small role, but is still one of his best performances of his career. The ending is probably one of the best endings ever made in movie history, a great twisted ending.

0385504225|1.0|This was just one bad read, most of the story you could skip right through.  The story itself was unbelievable and the characters just as bad.  Expect much bigger things from Dan Brown.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|Pure fluffy pop from start to finish and I loved every minute of it.  I considered rating this 4 stars because of the inevitable comparison to Life in Cartoon Motion.  That comparison lowers things a little.  The two albums have a very similar feel and any song from either album could easily fit on the other.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, especially if you like the upbeat feel Mika's music has, but I can't help feeling that I bought Life in Cartoon Motion a second time.  However, I decided to rate it 5 stars on the merit of two songs:  Good Gone Girl and One Foot Boy.  The former is different enough to liven things up a bit, it almost has a little bit of a hip-hop feel to it.  The latter is just plain fun.  It seems like a depressing topic, a boy with one foot, but Mika makes a light upbeat tune out of it.<br /><br />There was only one song on this album that I dislike (and I dislike it immensely): Toy Boy.  It feels like, I dunno... polka-pop.  That's as terrible as it sounds.  Every other song easily reaches the standard set by his debut album and I doubt anyone who liked that will regret buying The Boy Who Knew Too Much.  So, buy it!  Love it!<br /><br />As a note of interest, the song Blue Eyes was included which was originally released as part of the Songs for Sorrow EP.  So, if you want the other songs from Songs for Sorrow as well, you might be better off just purchasing the other two singles (Lady Jane - a good song and Lonely Alcoholic - one of my favorites) as an mp3 download.

0385504225|5.0|BEVERLY HILLS--Dan Brown's \\"DaVinci Code\\" was followed by \\"Angels and Demons.\\" Already the first five million books of his novel \\"The Lost Symbol\\" in hardcover is virtually sold out and surely Ron Howard will be putting the fascinating fictional story on film.     \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is a brilliant and compelling thriller. Dan Brown's prodigious talent for storytelling, infused with history, codes and intrigue, is on full display in this new book. This is one of the most anticipated publications in recent history, and it was well worth the wait,\\" said Sonny Mehta, Chairman and Editor in Chief of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group.     \\"The Lost Symbol\\" once again features the unforgettable protagonist, Robert Langdon in a story that jumps off the page and rivals the previous two novels. I think this book is perhaps better than the other two because Brown was able to perfect his story and I feel like I finally know Robert Langdon in this book.     Without giving the ending away, I'll say when the story begins, the Harvard professor Langdon, who is a symbologist is summoned to deliver an evening lecture in the U.S. Capitol Building. Within a short period of time upon his arrival, the night takes a shocking but expected turn for the readers. Langdon starts to recognize an object as an ancient invitation, one meant to usher its recipient onto a long, lost world of esoteric wisdom. Not surprisingly murders ensue and the protagonist Langdon is thrust into a supernatural story that follows much of the author's imagination to a stunning climax.     The 500 page book is never boring and the story moves in a typical Brown fast pace. This book is a must-read for Dan Brown fans and the theme that the books are better than the films probably will continue with this read.
0385504225|1.0|. . . . in reading \\"The Lost Symbol\\" by Dan Brown.  This book is not an adventure, its an exercise in tedium, staring many of your favorite, stock B-movie characters.  Truly, can we be expected to swallow the mean, secretive CIA chief who appears like the female warden in a women's prison film?  Right down to the wrecked voice, chain smoking and every-other-sentence menancing threats.  Give that lady a truncheon and we're ready to go!  If anyone was actually suprised with the true identity of the \\"villian\\" here, please do not admit that fact to the outside world.  You will just embarrass yourself.  And while Robert Langdon is perported to be a scholar and teacher, he is incredibly closed-minded when confronted by \\"new\\" data or ideas.  This main character, who had something to do in previous novels, seems out of place and lost amongst the treasures of Washington, DC.  He appears most multi-dimensional in the brief passages recounting classes and forums.  Perhaps he should have an adventure at a major university instead.    The writing lacks grace and flow, as did previous efforts \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\".  While a good storyteller can be forgiven a less than literary talent with language, a lack of story and constant re-hashing of information and (very bad) dialogue just shows a lack of skill and care.  While I wish I had the cool million Mr. Brown raked in on the first day of \\"The Lost Symbol\\", I hope I wouldn't be so cavalier about putting out a wordier version of a James Patterson plus assistant writer story.  As I neared the half-way point of this book, I really wanted someone to hit me on the head with a cap-stoned pyramid and get it over with.  Honestly, the idea behind this work is not worthly of 200 pages, let alone the number required to get to the end of this very disappointing offering. You are better off reading some nonfiction works regarding the Freemasons if interested - many to choose from and not nearly as trying to read.Last word to the wise (or anyone wanting entertainment), avoid this book.

B002PBTAL2|5.0|I really liked the episode and how Gemma dealt with what happened to her. Instead of just being the victim of a horrible act, she realized the future percussions of what could've happened if she had reported it. Changing from victim to a woman of power, wasn't easy and Tara and the nanny were helping her as much as she would allow.  On another note, Jax, Tig and Clay are hiding what really happened to Opie's wife and the killer. Trying to give Opie an outlet for revenge and still manage to keep silent is what bothers Jax. Blaming it on a rival gang has repercussions with the 9er's and the Mayan's. Especially since the Mayans got a tip from an unexpected source.  I rated the episode a 5 star, because of emotional and traumatizing issues that were being dealt with and how everyone related to one another.
0385504225|4.0|Great Story - I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what was next through the whole book.  If you loved Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, you're going to love this book too.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the story form was just like Da Vinci Code and Angels. For instance, a crime has been committed, call Robert Langdon - there is an object with a code that must be deciphered.  Secondly, the character of CIA Director Sato was not believable when she was first introduced.  For example, when a crime is committed, I couldn't believe she kept asking Langdon about symbolism for quite a few pages, before investigating the crime or national security issues.  But, the character gets back on track and an exciting story continues.  Don't let any of this discourage you from reading or buying the book.  The suspense is so good you can't put the book down.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol is a fun, freaky, fantastic read. I enjoyed learning more about all the symbolism incorporated into the buildings in Washington DC, about the hopes of our nation's founders for a society based on knowledge, wisdom and spirituality.     Brown is brilliant, a great storyteller with an inspiring story to tell. Though I rarely re-read books, I will read The Lost Symbol again someday because, even as I raced through the story, propelled by the thrilling adventure and so many secrets revealed, I found many instances where I knew there was more: layers of meaning, circles in circles.

Whether you are looking to help increase your awareness in the business sector, in your personal life, or wanting to go more specifically into behavioral analysis training, this book will help provide you a solid background on body language and, more importantly, the reason why it occurs.  A very practical book and easily a bible on nonverbal tells.

B002GZQY6Q|1.0|I've been a longtime fan and have seen PT live multiple times as well.  I've preordered just about every album they've put out, and I must say I was extremely excited to get this one.  I listened to it once and thought it was a giant turd.  Now this happens quite a bit while listening to \\"prog\\" albums, so I didn't think much of it as I've never been disappointed by anything they've put out before.  I've listened to the album in its entirety no less than 10 times and it is flat out a BAD album.  The lyrics are cheesy, the musical structure seems more messy than progressive, and the production is actually poor- all of which are surprising coming from Steven Wilson.  Still one of my favorite bands, but this is going deep into my cd collection to be forgotten.
B000JJS8TM|3.0|I was very excited to get the CD after seeing the show. I wasn't really paying attention, probably should have known that the DVD didn't offer anything extra, but figured since I was going to buy the CD, I better go all-out and get the DVD as well. Anyway, it was a huge waste to pay the extra for the DVD. Don't know why they would even package it with the CD. Does anyone out there have a time when they would only want the DVD and not the CD? Or would somebody be in a situation where the DVD worked better? There's no video whatsoever (at least not that I could find) on the DVD, and I was very disappointed.     Great CD, great music, but skip the DVD.    UPDATE:  Apparently I was incorrect about the DVD, according to some. However, I still stand by my comments. It's not worth getting the DVD. After seeing the show, I'm sure the DVD with 5.1 surround sound added on couldn't compare to how the music was broadcast in the theater where I saw it. I got the CD because I enjoy the music, and the music can be enjoyed just fine without the DVD. I probably should have read better and realized that the DVD was audio only, and I admit that was my own mistake for buying it. But, as I said, I still stand by my comments and stick to the fact that the DVD wasn't worth the extra money.
B000JLPMPS|4.0|Clint Eastwood managed to find a masterpiece of a script this time, and the brilliance of his directorship shone through. In this movie, the supposedly righteous sheriff turns out to be a brutal arbitrator, the violent, face-cutting cowboy an ordinary young man who committed a mindless crime, the celebrated \\"English Bob\\" a hollow underachiever and liar, and the seemingly fearless \\"Schofield Kid\\" a boastful but naive young man, the prostitutes a hive of hateful, vindictive beings. Eastwood plays William Munny, a supposedly reformed ex-killer and weak old man who, at the sheriff's slaying of the innocent friend accompanying him on his bounty, re-engaged in violence and vengeance and overcame even the sheriff and his deputies. In short, the one supposed to be the good guy turns out to be vicious and unconscionable, the otherwise insignificant (prostitutes) reveals themselves to be murderous, and then justice comes in the most unlikely source and form.    With a cast consisted of Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Morgan Freeman, Eastwood got himself a movie teeming with such solid acting as to be hard to surpass in the film industry, alongside with his latter production of The Space Cowboys. This movie is also filled with supple nuances that withstand repeated viewing in appreciation of the finely crafted action sequences and cinematography. I enjoyed the little humors that Eastwood shared with the audience, such as him resorting to a shotgun for target practice after failing with a handgun, the exaggerated description of abhorring acts done to the prostitute that he describes to Freeman's character, the little standoff between Harris' \\"English Bob\\" character and Hackman's \\"Little Bill\\" character at the Barbershop, etc.     The Western that Eastwood depicts is an expansive and clean-aired one, and one could almost smell the fabric off his old jacket and the sogginess of that jail house in the rain, not to mention the wetness at W.W. Beauchamp's foot. With all the violence in this film, there is the irrepressible background premise of the human conscience, of what ought to be necessity and justice, and what truly are not.    The Blu-Ray transfer is beautiful and the sound is more detailed and dynamic. There is even a complete black-and-white episode of the 1959 Maverick TV show starring Eastwood included. I bought it for $9.99 from Amazon; for a movie starring solid acting and wonderful story-telling, and in wonderful picture and sound, this disc is indispensable.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I like and enjoy this album, but it's not their best.  There are some moments here are greatness, but some of the songs fall a bit flat.  The production on the album also sounds thin, and not lush like some of their other recording.    Stand out songs:  Marker In The Sand, Life Wasted, Severed Hand, Army Reserve, and Parachutes.    OK songs: Comatose, World Wide Suicide, Inside Job, Unemployable, Come Back, Wasted Reprise and Big Wave    Not so great: Gone
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Mark Wahlberg does a great job in this movie! It is an action packed movie from start to finish, where there is not really a dull moment. Not many movies about an expert with a sniper rifle, and others like SNIPER were not very good. If sniper rifles interest you, or just modern guns/rifles in general than you will really enjoy this movie. Lots of great shoot out scenes, and lots of explosions! Rated R because of violence and language. This could be Mark Wahlberg's best movie, and it's one of my favorites for sure! DVD extras are great too, with features showing Mark Wahlberg actually getting sniper rifle training! Very Cool!

0439023483|5.0|I admit I was a little skeptical.  I found this book because Stephenie Meyer recommended it on her website.  I, like many others, have the read The Twilight Series, and have been searching for books that hook me in like those did.  Quite a few have been a little disappointing, however, when I finally got around to giving Hunger Games a try, that all changed.      This book hooks you in immediately.  The development of the characters is excellent and you really feel for the main character Katniss. The book is brutal and violent and at some points, a little disturbing.  I literally had moments where my mouth was hanging open in disbelief because of what had just occurred.  This books sucks you in though and it's an absolutely amazing read.  One warning, once you pick it up, it'll be pretty hard to put it down. Enjoy!
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|Ever take anyone snipe hunting or been taken yourself? If so, you can understand how I felt watching this movie. A lot of exciting promise that ultimately leaves you feeling foolish for believing that something special might just happen. SHOOTER starts off strong and in the first 20 minutes promises to be Bourne like in quality and excitement. Sadly all that degenerates in the 2nd act where hackneyed politics ala Michal Moore become more important than storyline or plot progression. The promise of the opening of the film are pretty much shattered at that point, and are then ground to dust in the despicably bad final act. No attempt is made to make the 'bad guys' even remotely believable or rounded. They are cardboard cut-outs more fit to be in an episode of Scooby-do or Rocky & Bullwinkle than a serious political thriller. They quite literally sit around in a cabin laughing uproariously about their misdeeds and how they flaunted the law! It's comical in the sad, I'm laughing at the writers and producer of this film sort of way. Danny Glover has certainly fallen fast and far--at least his role in SHOOTER isn't as bad as his more recent [[ASIN:B0026MP1CC Night Train]].<br /><br />There are some good scenes in the film, especially the opening scene and the escape scene near the end of the first act. These just set you up for disappointment as the movie progresses simultaneously towards COMMANDO like carnage and cliched socialist rants.<br /><br />In brief, this is a movie that had promise but was made top-heavy and silly by an over emphasis on stupid, cliched, anti-government political rants and sermonizing as well as silly 30 on 1 Rambo scenes. The reason the Bourne movies are so great is that in spite of some less believable bits (the car chase in movie two where Bourne steals a Russian cab for example) they reflect accurate craft and are respectable from a realism standpoint. SHOOTER is not believable at all. It is silly and joyless.<br /><br />1 Star.

0439023491|5.0|The second installment in The Hunger Games trilogy definitely delivers!  There were plot twists and action throughout.  Can't wait for the third one!
0385504225|2.0|I recently read Dan Brown's new thriller novel, \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"     I promise not to reveal any plot twists or surprise endings. However, I will say that there was only one plot twist that I found truly surprising, and that is indicative of my feelings about the book as a whole.     In the interests of full disclosure, I've always found Mr. Brown's thriller writing to be workmanlike, the product of a studious journeyman rather than the output of an accomplished master of the genre.     To give credit where credit is due, he absolutely has figured out the formula for commercial success, and I, for one, am not going to denigrate him for making the choice to pursue that path rather than die penniless on a park bench in fruitless pursuit of artistic purity.     His current work, \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" will undoubtedly be a large commercial success and be made into another blockbuster movie. The upside is that discounted sales of the book may increase brick-and-mortar retail book store foot traffic and online referred book activity, thus driving sales of other titles. And in today's publishing market, that would be a very good thing for all involved.     However, no amount of marketing millions will change \\"The Lost Symbol\\" into the thriller it could have been with one simple change. Merely by deleting somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of its content, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" would be a much better book.     What 30 to 50 percent of the content should be deleted? It is the same 30 to 50 percent of unrelated content that ruined the later titles of Tom Clancy, another thriller writer who lost his way.     There seems to be a law of the universe at work here that states, \\"Once a writer earns a few million and begins to believe the accolades of their fans and the brilliance claimed in their publisher's press releases, the writer feels entitled to preach rather than teach, cajole rather than captivate and provide indoctrination rather than insight.\\"     What Mr. Clancy and Mr. Brown share in this regard is they are no longer writing books to entertain and perhaps, just a little, educate; they are writing books to advance a very specific agenda. While topics such as social politics, sexual politics or belief systems have long provided conceptual and foundational elements of drama and storytelling; they are best used, and by far most effective, when they are used as plot and character development elements, not topics of shrill and unrelenting browbeating.     No matter how much I or anyone else may agree or disagree with the subject of Mr. Clancy's, Mr. Brown's or any other thriller writer's latest pet cause, the inevitable result of filling a large portion of a thriller novel with material that is more about advancing that cause than advancing the plot is a much weaker work and a diminishment of the genre as a whole. The purpose of a thriller is to thrill, not to indoctrinate.     While it is almost certain that authors who pass over the tipping point of believing they are uniquely suited to lead the masses towards enlightenment regarding their particular cause du jour do so in good faith; they are, when viewed objectively, much more likely to slip into the category of the Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. That's a title most people would shun, since it is shared with another writer of novels and plays, the PhD. and thought leader, Paul Joseph Goebbels.
0385504225|3.0|I was looking forward to The Lost Symbol and another Dan Brown thriller in which the plot and his writing had aged like a fine wine.<br />Although the story was enjoyable, and is indeed somewhat of a thriller, it was not as impressive as I had hoped.<br />While the story plot is good, I think the writing could have been better, and I guess I expected a more polished Dan Brown.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ The whole idea of solving a puzzle of symbols appeals to the inquisitive human mind.<br />+ The story is a thrilling ride that takes place within the a short time period.<br />+ Robert Langdon is a likable character that's easy to root for.<br />+ The Masonic theme is enough to keep most people interested.<br />+ The Lost Symbol is an overall quick read (some chapters do move slow however).<br /><br />Cons<br />- Character actions are not really believable.<br />- Some of the product mentions seem to standout too much (All of a sudden we need to call an SUV a Lexus?)<br />- Some of the technical jargon seems thrown in *just* to make it seem hip and new. (Twitter is brought up at the end as well.)<br />- I think many people will expect something of a big bang at the end, so they may be disappointed.<br /><br />Although some people may assume an average rating means a terrible book, that was not the case for me.<br />Did it fail to meet my expectations of Dan Brown? Yes.<br />Does that mean the book is terrible? No!<br />The Lost Symbol is still an enjoyable read, although you might consider waiting for the paperback or buying the book used.

Now, not only is there a sweet dvd version, but also this features the Director's Cut which features a Bruce Springsteen soundtrack instead of the Bob Seger music, some extra scenes (not deleted scenes, but original scenes edited back into the movie), an interview with Peter Bogdanovich discussing the differences between the versions, what the real relationship was like working with Cher, etc., and Director's commentary. For film fans this is the version to buy.

In this book she is writing such a fantastic journey that in the end you feel so drawn into the storytelling that it makes you think twice about life, love and human creation.  I read this book in 3 days and was unable to put it down.   I have given it to several friends who had the same experience.  Thank you Anne Rice for writing such a wonderful book.   Can't wait for a continuing story.
B0014BECF8|4.0|It is well over twenty years since I first heard Careless Whisper. My children were playing a tape of it during a long car journey, and it caught my attention and has haunted my recollection ever since. My own musical home ground is classical, and I have never followed the charts to any great extent. However music to me is just music, its effect is unpredictable and irrational, and there is never any mistaking the unaccountable thrill that some music can give me, whatever category of music it supposedly belongs in.<br /><br />This set has just been given to me as a birthday present by one of the children, who are now of course adults. The idea is apparently to take me out of my classical comfort zone, but if one thing has consistently struck me in half a century of hearing pop music it is just how conservative it is in certain ways. The harmonisation would in general have seemed unenterprising to composers in the year 1700, yet this is the kind of music that millions really listen to and are really affected by. From this I have to draw the conclusion that a simple harmony that lasts unaltered through untold numbers of changes of musical fashion, style and idiom can hardly be thought of as outmoded, whatever the earnest intellectual theories of the 20th century.<br /><br />George Michael has apparently composed most of the music here himself, and I certainly seem to detect a resemblance in the style of many of the numbers. Unsurprisingly, I like some of them better than some others, and still none matches up to Careless Whisper for me. Bottom of the charts for me is the joint number with Elton John 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me', I have to say. However something that does a lot for even the items that interest me less from a musical viewpoint is George Michael's voice. This is really most striking and distinctive in its higher register, a fine tenor sound that will continue to keep me listening to songs that would not hold my attention otherwise.<br /><br />Whether I was in that much of a musical comfort zone I rather doubt, but the matter is not for me to judge. I am not at all comfortable with some 20th century 'classical' music and I am rarely uncomfortable with the pops, even if only intermittently interested. This set is going to be chiefly background music for me, I'm sure, but it's mainly new music to me at the moment. I'm not shaken in the least although I genuinely am stirred up to a point. Why should that be otherwise? It's music innit?of a musical comfort zone I rather doubt, but the matter is not for me to judge.

1416594787|3.0|I am a critic of Dawkins.  I wrote a response to The God Delusion (\\"The Truth Behind the New Atheism\\"), the essence of which could be summarized by paraphrasing a comment Dawkins makes in this book:<br /><br />\\"It would be nice if those who oppose evolution (Christianity) would take a tiny bit of trouble to learn the merest rudiments of what it is that they are opposing.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, when I saw this book on the \\"best-seller\\" rack in the same store in Dawkins' home town where I bought GD, I thought I'd give him a second chance.<br /><br />I'm glad I did; this is a much better book.  It's well-written, as always.  It has awesome photos and lots of humor.  Clearly Dawkins is much more in his element talking about life forms than theology, the history of religion, or American culture.  Sometimes Dawkins gets carried away with whimsy, sarcasm, or on tangents -- but those are often entertaining, too.<br /><br />More importantly, Dawkins makes a case for evolution, in a limitted sense, that I think is fairly persuasive.  What he establishes is evolution in the sense of, \\"common descent, over billions of years, from relatively simple life to the myriad creatures.\\"  On that, I think his argument should be persuasive to anyone open to being persuaded.<br /><br />But why does an Oxford zoologist insist on \\"debating\\" only the most ignorant opponents?  Why does he give us a more than four page transcript of his conversation with a representative from Concerned Women for America, whom he tears to pieces to his evident satisfaction, and never mention any proponent of Intelligent Design?<br /><br />I was hoping he would.  I wanted to read Dawkins' best argument against the most convincing arguments the other side could put up, for the curious reason that I really would like to know if there's anything to ID.<br /><br />Instead, I found a strange but yawning \\"gap\\" in Dawkins' argument.<br /><br />Dawkins knows who Michael Behe is.  He wrote a review of his last book, The Edge of Evolution, for the New York Times.  He never mentions him overtly in this book, but he does refer to him, at least twice.  On page 128, Dawkins refers to \\"the 'irreducible complexity' of creationist propaganda.\\"  Then again on 132, he writes how \\"creationists\\" revile a certain set of experiments, because they show the power of natural selection \\"undermines their central dogma of irreducible complexity.\\"  As Dawkins well knows, \\"Irreducible complexity\\" is the signal idea in Behe's popular Darwin's Black Box, probably the most widely-cited book in the ID arsenal.<br /><br />These references occur in an interesting context here.  You find them in a chapter called \\"Before Our Own Eyes,\\" about the fact that on occasion, evolution occurs so rapidly that it can be witnessed.  More specifically, Dawkins offers these jibes towards the beginning of a seventeen-page long discussion of Richard Lenski's experiments with e-coli.<br /><br />Dawkins discussion of these experiments is more than a little flabbergasting, giving his claim to have read Edge of Evolution.  Behe discussed those experiments in that book, in quite a bit of detail as I recall.  Behe also discussed the mutations Dawkins refers to here in a blog about a year ago.  Dawkins mentions none of that.  He says nothing about the probility of particular mutations compared to population size.  He doesn't even deal with the physiological detail Behe gave.  Reading this, it is hard to believe that he even read chapter 7 of Behe's book, still less his blog on how one \\"tribe\\" of e-coli found a way to metabolize citrate.  He imagines that these experimental results are a great blow to Behe's concept of IC, completely overlooking the fact that these results are just what Behe predicted!  A single instance of a probably double mutation in e coli after trillions of cell divisions, is closely in line with Behe's predictions.  Surely someone as literate as Dawkins ought to be able to see this.  Behe wrote in his blog ayear ago:<br /><br />\\"In The Edge of Evolution I had argued that the extreme rarity of the development of chloroquine resistance in malaria was likely the result of the need for several mutations to occur before the trait appeared. Even though the evolutionary literature contains discussions of multiple mutations, Darwinian reviewers drew back in horror, acted as if I had blasphemed, and argued desperately that a series of single beneficial mutations certainly could do the trick. Now here we have Richard Lenski affirming that the evolution of some pretty simple cellular features likely requires multiple mutations.\\"<br /><br />So Behe knows very well that duel mutations can aid in evolution on occasion.  How bizarre for Dawkins to treat the same thing here as the death knell of IC!<br /><br />Dawkins also claims that in Lenski's experiment:<br /><br />\\"It all happened in a tiny faction of the time evolution normally takes.\\"<br /><br />Nonsense.  20,000 generations is the equivalent of 400,000 years for human beings.  A trillion individuals would be equal to perhaps 20 million years of human evolution.<br /><br />Dawkins then talks about how bacteria develop resistance to drugs -- the main subject of Behe's book, but he takes no notice whatsoever of any of the tough details Behe discusses.  All we get are glib words of comfort for anyone who might doubt the power of evolution, and an attack on \\"goons and fools\\" at some conservative web site led by a lawyer.  Dawkins seems to refuse to engage in any but the most childish contrary arguments -- a remarkable act of self-discipline for a scholar.<br /><br />I'm finding it hard to \\"place\\" this guy.  There's no doubt he knows a lot about the natural world, and is in love with its wonders.  No one can deny that he is a brilliant and evocative writer, that his similes are often moving and suggestive, and that many eminent scientists swear by him.  Nor would I deny this book is worth reading.<br /><br />But Richard Dawkins seems to me less a scholar, and even rhetorical pugalist, than that sort of mythologist, like Freud, Nietzche, or Marx, who cloaks his beliefs in the language but not always the rigor of scientific argument.  To the extent he argues, he only seems inclined, to take on the easiest possible targets; indeed one gets the feeling both here and in GD that he is talking down to his readers.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it's not a bad book.  Read it for the beautiful descriptions of the natural world, and for its fairly convincing argument for common descent.  If you want an argument against ID, the best I have found so far is Michael Shermer's Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design.e extreme rarity of the development of chloroquine resistance in malaria was likely the result of the need for several mutations to occur before the trait appeared.

B002GZQYMK|1.0|With this album, Muse has finally become what all their detractors have said they were from the beginning; a bloated, bombastic parody.  The orchestrations are so thoroughly over-the-top with synth and cheesy strings that I was floored.  I mean, how can anyone actually like Guiding Light?  It sounds like the misbegotten child of an eighties power ballad and an Andrew Lloyd Weber show tune.   While they've always had the potential to be a little silly, on The Resistance the lyrics are often downright embarrassing.  Uprising is the most popular song and the one that stands out most for me.  \\"It's time the fat-cats had a heart attack\\"?  Really?  I share the politics, but the song is every bad protest poem I've ever heard set to music.  It doesn't help that the music is so cold and mechanical that it doesn't leave you feeling anything at all, let alone outrage.  (The high-pitched \\"so come on!\\" repeated ad nauseam between the verses are just ridiculous as well.)  It's an easy target, but Undisclosed Desires reminds me of that Scream album Chris Cornell released awhile back.  Enough said.  And we always knew that Muse was the new Queen, but did they really have to outright ape them in United States of Eurasia?  I Belong to You starts out with a lame \\"Woo!\\" and some awful mock-soul humming then proceeds with an overabundance of chimes and piano glisses.      I could go on, but I won't.  Muse was one of my favorites, but here it seems like they took everything too far just for novelty's sake.  I get wanting to stretch your legs and try new things, but when all of your new things are slick, hokey, overwrought songs like these, you're trying just a bit to hard.

It made sense to me that it would be an accomplished actor. William Hurt is reading it with a humorous lilt and angst that conceptually matches the style and content.

0061730327|5.0|This is so much more than the story of clever engineering by an unschooled villager.   They authors sketch an entire culture in vivid detail, so that the accomplishments of the young man are put in context.    What kept striking me over and over as I read was how alien this culture was to my American experience.    Of course growing up I had heard of \\"starving children in Africa\\" but this book was written by one of those formerly starving children--and the story was heart-wrenching!    I was utterly engrossed by the story, utterly fascinated one moment and repulsed in the next, as I read heart-breaking stories of starvation, \\"witch doctors,\\" and abject poverty.    I take for granted free public education, but this story shows the tragedy of a child who wants to be educated but can't afford the fees.      I think it is entirely appropriate as a YA level book.  There are some references to prostitutes, AIDS and other STDs, and some concerns about castration.  However there is nothing particularly graphic and I would feel comfortable giving it to any child old enough to read such a long book!  (Probably 5th grade at the youngest).     Basically this is a great book that I highly recommend and will be keeping on my shelf for rereading!

He's certainly no James Brown.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I absolutely love the True Blood series on HBO.  When I decided to shop around for the complete first season, I knew that Amazon.com would have the best price.  It was such a different experience to watch all the episodes in order.  The series also offers a lot of extras, with episode summaries, previews, and special features.  If you love True Blood, definitely buy this series.

B000000XB9|5.0|Creedence is probably the most uniquely talented band of all time,there's so many elements in their music.Styles such as southern rock,blues,mountain music,etc.It's hard for someone not to be caught tapping their toes or singing along to the energetic songs such as -Travelin Man,lookin' out my back door,Fortunate Son,Run through the jungle,all the way to the memorable songs of 'Have you ever seen the rain' and my favorite song 'someday never comes'.My grandparents got me into Creedence when I was little and since then their songs have always had a special place in my heart.
0786888628|5.0|David Halberstam's \\"The Coldest Winter\\" is one of the most fascinating histories of war that I have read.  It provides a detailed account of the political background leading up to the Korean War with Mao's army first fighting the Japanese and Chiang's Kuomintang forces, Stalin's involvement and refusal to commit Soviet troops, Kim Il Song's background and rashness, MacArthur's seeming imperial autonomy in the Dai Ichi Building in Tokyo, and the continuing deference and ambiguous orders issued to him by the Joint Chiefs and the White House.  Much history about most of the men involved, like Dean Acheson, Averill Harriman, Harry S Truman, Dean Rusk, Henry Luce, and a host of others, is well-developed so that the reader has insights into their thinking.<br /><br />The story is extremely readable and entertaining as Halberstam carries his readers through the political machinations, incompetence, and corruption of the Nationalist Chinese.  Their influence in Washington on foreign policy is shocking to discover.  Even as Chiang's troops constantly abandoned their American-supplied weapons and materiel in the field to the communists, the China Lobby urged congress to pass more and more appropriations bills that simply led to a better supplied enemy as the Nationalists retreated.  The extreme right-wing Republicans supporting Chiang, who were known as the \\"China Firsters,\\" denigrated the patriotism of those who did not fully agree with them and made Truman's life difficult as he tried to limit the scope of the war.  In retrospect and in fairness, the actions of many in that group seem treasonous today, but have to be considered within an era in which the U.S. was finding its way as a newly-minted superpower in a turbulent and dangerous post-war world with its threat of a Soviet takeover of Europe.<br /><br />Halberstam's chronicle of the frigid war in Korea is gripping as the weakness of the U.S. army and the incompetence of many of its senior commanders are exposed.  Those who suffer the most through his pen are General Ned Almond; who is revealed to be rash, abrasive, short-sighted, and reckless with the lives of American troops; Charles Willoughby, who as MacArthur's top intelligence officer, refused to accept reports from the field of Red Chinese infiltration of the Korean peninsula and whose faulty analysis and twisted logic led to massive underestimation of the size and ability of Mao's army and heavily contributed to the needless deaths of U.S. servicemen; and, MacArthur himself, who bathed in glory after Inchon, but who was insubordinate, never spent a single night in Korea, and claimed to be able to respond to the Chinese through his intuition, since he \\"understood the oriental mind.\\"  USMC General O.P. Smith is shown as one of the few competent senior officers as he smells the Chinese ambush awaiting the Marines and deliberately delays execution of Almond's orders to rush north toward the Yalu.  Smith's caution and efficiency saved countless U.S. lives and administered large scale casualties on the enemy.  Halberstam draws parallels between the blind northern push by Almond and the massacre of Custer's men at Little Big Horn.  As I read about the crossing of the 38th parallel by the Americans and the rapid push north, it reminded me of how the Russians retreated in the face of Napoleon's army, leading them deeper and deeper into a vast country until they were annihilated.<br /><br />The centerpiece of this account of the war is, of course, the friction between MacArthur and President Truman and MacArthur's relief for insubordination and meddling in political affairs.  Perhaps at no time since the Civil War has our founders' constitutional scheme been as threatened as it was by the general's outrageous disregard for civil oversight of the military and rogue statements of U.S. foreign policy.<br /><br />Halberstam's Korean War history is a comprehensive masterpiece, which is easy to read, compelling, and difficult to put down.I highly recommend it to all readers interested in military and diplomatic history.ll readers interested in military and diplomatic history.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|Star trek has been written about probably more than any show.  From its countless pop culture references, to it examination of political and social commentaries, Star Trek has been talked about ad nauseam.   Given the vast amount of writings, in some ways, its almost arrogant to try and add something new.  However, if you're reading this, you're probably not as interested in a review of the series and episodes as much as you're interested in whether the Blu Ray is worth getting.  I will say this new Blu-ray is something rather special.  The picture is amazing, and I feel almost like I'm watching the show again for the first time, kind of like when you've heard a joke a hundred times, but then one day you hear it a little different and you laugh, like its new but familiar as well.    However, the trouble is that the Blu ray is almost too good.  I can tell when the make up meshes with real skint.  I can tell when a punch misses the target.  In fact, the Blu Ray is so clear that you can actually see and clearly identify the stunt doubles as they are intermixed with the close up of kirk or whoever is fighting.  So your interest in the Blu ray may vary.  While the show's strengths in story and acting are highlighted, the weaknesses of the technology are made the more apparent.  That being said, I love having the ability to watch both the new and old effects addition, as well as the slew of special features included makes this a must have for me.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Having watched Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog already on the internet many months prior, I must say that I wasn't expecting any surprises when I received the dvd. I was expecting to simply have the three part series on DVD - accessible and easily manageable. I had heard that the commentary was funny, so I turned it on and sat back.    I was blown away. The commentary is as good, if not better, than the title piece.     Joss Whedon has struck again. Whedon's genius nevers fails to astound me, and this Sing-Along Blog was no exception.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I heard about this movie from the Independence Film Channel where there was a discussion of the more progressive movies out there, and how hard it was for movie makers especially in the U.S. to get their movies out there for the viewers. When this movie was featured, it looked interesting so my husband and I decided to order it and give it a try. The plot was really good, and so was the acting. It was a really well thought out and an enjoyable movie.
B000VSBX34|5.0|When it comes to Sid, the only thing that explains our heritage better then Death Ring would be the Beatles. Looking back to the start of 94 are some of the fondest memories in Sid's history. Those days of cruising in Santa's giant gold Oldsmobile singing along to some early Beatles, anything prior to Revolver at the time, were some of the greatest times that have ever taken place. Even though we have a very vast catalog of music favorites the Beatles just seem to take us back to those glory days we can't help but relive in our minds. Which brings us to our feature of the evening.<br /><br />We're not going to go too far into the synopsis since most are very familiar with the film. However if you're not here it is, Ringo has a giant Ruby ring that is needed as part of an Eastern cult's sacrifice. So they discover the drummer of the Beatles has the ring and set off to England to get it back. Only problem is Ringo can't seem to remove the ring which leads to plenty of laughs thanks to a cast of very stoned Beatles. Sure the film is goofy, as one reviewing said, but that is what the Beatles humor was at the time. It was the 1965, what kind of humor were you expecting? No matter what it's a 5 star film with some great laughs and even greater music. It's the perfect blend to keep the Thursday version of Sid's focus in tact.<br /><br />Naturally Help comes with a huge recommendation from us for any Beatles fan out there. Even if you didn't live during the time when the film was released, it's still a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by the right viewer. Sid happens to have an old soul and lives for this kind of stuff. Also now knowing The Beatles were stoned out of their mind's throughout the entire film just adds an extra amount of enjoyment. It hardly possible to leave the couch stoned let alone film an entire movie with music included. So we close with this memory from Ringo, \\"A hell of a lot of pot was being smoked while we were making the film. It was great. Very little would get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script.\\"get done after lunch. In the afternoon we very seldom got past the first line of the script.\\"

0385504225|1.0|Well, I have to go along with many others here.    This is a very sad follow up to a fine series.  This book is so poorly written, it is painful.  The plot devices are reruns of his prior novels.  The 'science' is so twisted and unbelievable as to be laughable.      It is so obvious that DB wrote this under pressure just to write another Langdon novel.  There is zero orginality, total rehash of plot, and mindless idiocy of the protagonists that at one point I actually tossed the book across the room I was so frustrated.    Don't waste your time on this.  If you want a good read, reread DVC.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Austen film adaptations. Sally Hawkins is a perfect Anne Eliot, and Rupert Penry Jones carries off resentful, proud, yet longing -- with excellence. These two are perfect for their roles, and I absolutely love the direction of this film -- from the camera shots, to the music -- it's perfect. It's definitely in heavy rotation at my house.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|This is a great mixture of old and new Michael. It goes all the way back to the Jackson 5 through to the newer stuff. Such a diverse compilation. My only problem is not with the music, it is with the cd itself. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but I have had to exchange this cd three times. Everytime I open it and play it, the cd either already has a scratch on it (from the factory), or skips. What in the world...it could just be my luck. But anyways, great music selection, not having a good time trying to find one that works however.
0767903374|2.0|I'm a highly sensitive person, and in today's world, it can be a handicap -- whether at the workplace or in relationships. This book, and it's companion, the Highly Sensitive Person -- validates what you're feeling or what you go through in life as a \\"HSP\\" (or, let's be honest - BPD sufferer) -- but it doesn't give you any real, helpful tools to try to overcome your sensitivity.     I would be apt to recommend any type of DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) book, or even books like Byron Katie's \\"Loving What Is\\" or \\"I Need Your Love -- Is That True?\\" over this.
0385504225|1.0|Quick quiz - what's common between DVC, A&D and The Lost Symbol? I'll tell ya -     1) An unstoppable invincible twisted mercenary who is bigger, badder, smarter and more powerful than than 10 delta force squads put together. But then just doesn't have enough smarts to outdo Langdon & Co. in the end.    2) A super smart woman turned damsel-in-distress turned Langdon sidekick    3) A super rich and influential male who is Langdon's confidant, soundboard and source of superior knowledge. And of course is inevitably kidnapped or targetted by #1.    4) A confident yet confused Langdon who is in \\"surely dead\\" situations but pulls a james bond everytime. And of course he's an encylopedia of knowledge of everything - from the tip of your finger nails to the 4th brick in the right wall of your neighbourhood church. And yet, he always requires 2 rounds to decipher the true meaning of clues - the first one which is obvious  and turns out to be not right, and then he has an OMG moment to figure out the \\"real\\" meaning.    5) And finally, paintings, pyramids, talismans - clues which are built up to have the greatest if not the most earth shattering conclusions turn out to be a little whiff of nothing. And make you go..really? (Well DVC wasn;t that bad I admit)      Why do i still read I ask? It's like bad music - you listen to it enough and you'll start humming it.     Final conclusion in two words - Skip It.    PS. The secret is in It.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I've been using the 405CX for about 1 1/2 months and have found it to be a device with loads of potential. Sadly however, the full potential cannot be realized due to both unreliable software for the Mac and an unstable web site provided by Garmin. But before going into further detail on the software and web services, let me describe the GPS sport watch.    This GPS watch from Garmin is designed to be used while training to track things like route, speed, pace, time, heart rate, and other items of interest (e.g. if you have a bike, then you can track cadence). In this regard, the watch works pretty well for runners, walkers, and cyclists.     The watch utilizes a built-in GPS to track route and speed. GPS acquisition time is very fast -- typically less than 30 seconds. Tracking accuracy is reasonable -- I'd estimate about +/- 30 ft. Note that it is also able to track altitude, which is something I find useful as a cyclist.    Keep in mind that to track some things, you will need to buy additional accessories like a bike cadence sensor (one for each bike) or a foot pod. So the upfront cost may be substantial depending on your situation. But if you are an exercise junkie, then this may not be much of a concern.    General usability of the watch is OK once you get accustomed to the typical quirks most gadgets seem to exhibit these days. Ease-of-use isn't top notch or anywhere close to it. The watch uses a touch-sensitive bezel that can be both over- and under-sensitive. Nonetheless, you can grow accustomed to the menus and functions after a while and the quirks don't get in the way much on a day-to-day basis. The watch also has some nice customization abilities that can be used to arrange what items to display during workouts.      The interesting part of the watch package is the USB stick that allows you to sync the collected data. The stick plugs into a USB port on your computer and, in theory, automatically (and wirelessly) transfers workout information both to the computer and optionally the Garmin web site. But this is where things get very frustrating (on a Mac at least).    In short, Garmin is really struggling (as of 9/2009) to produce reliable and functional software. I have wasted countless hours dealing with their buggy Ant agent. Frequent Garmin software releases have yet to solve the many issues on both Leopard and Snow Leopard (I have tested on multiple Mac OS X versions). At least 50% of the time, the software fails to transfer properly -- even on repeated attempts. When this happens, there are no diagnostics to indicate the reason for failure. Worse still, the USB device sometimes causes kernel panics (the Mac equivalent of Windows' blue screen of death).     Once you are able to successfully transfer your workout data, then it will also be uploaded to the Garmin Connect web site. This Java-based web site is sometimes overloaded and spews copious error messages due to the situation. Furthermore, Garmin takes the web site completely offline for hours at a time (during North American weekday working hours even). When the site is stable and running, then workout summaries, charts, and reports are at your disposal to track your fitness program. The web site services aren't anything fancy, but they are pretty good and getting better over time.    This ability to track workouts over time online is the primary value proposition of the GPS watch. When the whole thing works, it is very cool and a useful tool for exercise junkies. But the sad truth is that most of the time the potential isn't unleashed and instead you feel cheated by Garmin. And until these problems are solved, then the price of the package just isn't justified by the lousy software and service.    P.S. Other things of that may be of interest to potential buyers of the watch...    Battery life: the watch uses a non-user-replaceable battery (the bane of iPhone and Kindle 2 users) and requires a service fee from Garmin to replace. Battery life is good at about 6-8 hours in practice. Lifetime of the battery remains to be seen.    Standalone Software: the watch also comes with a standalone software product, Garmin Training Software, that can be used to view workout information locally instead of using the Garmin Connect web site. This software provides some of the same functionality as the web site, including maps, but isn't all that polished.
B000026OHN|5.0|Oh my oh my oh my.<br /><br />Look, I really enjoy Glenn Gould.  I own the original jacket box set - a major commitment of both money and space. Gould opened my ears and tuned my hearing in a manner that few pianists have. But Bach filtered through Gould is, well, Bach filtered through Gould.<br /><br />Richter's Bach is heavenly. Yes, the recording is a little too reverberant for my taste as well. But think of the reverberance as the atmosphere in an old cathedral.  You walk in, it is empty. A man is seated at the piano and he is playing Bach's WTC. The sound wafts through the apse. Echoes through the vaults, and echoes off of the roof. It is, truly, the sound of heaven.<br /><br />That is the pleasure to have from this disc. It may not be the only version of WTC that you own (indeed it should not be) but it will offer many, many years of listening pleasure.<br /><br />Truly a deep pool to swim in.<br /><br />Thank you Scott Morrison for your review which encouraged the purchase.
0385504225|2.0|I was so looking forward to Dan Brown's new book, The Lost Symbol, that I pre-ordered on my Kindle and got right to reading in the wee hours of the morning.  From the beginning, the ancient mystery to be revealed and the tone of this weak thriller felt off and forced. The story lacks the energy and spice that was so present in the De Vinci Code.      There are moments when Lost Symbol captivates and one's anticipation builds - but the pay-offs are repeatedly transparent and weak.  There is reference to a cosmic religion vetted by science that will heal our great human divide (readers of Joseph Campbell, respected scholar, lecturer and writer of mythology and comparative religion will remember this topic).  As desirable as that is, however, the examples of science and mystery given were not so much supernatural science and mystery as they were tabloid.  Reading Lost Symbol felt like new-age meets Masons with Monsters on the side. I was expecting so much more and was deeply disappointed.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I first bought this cd because i had to choose between it and \\"over the hills and far away\\". The reason I chose this one is simple. 6 of the tracks on the other album are ones I already have. This album is all new however. I liked it right away.<br />The way she sings in a few of the songs are sublime. \\"Nemo\\" is really good, but I think my favorite on this album is actualy \\"higher than hope\\". The way she sings is truly awesome. This would have to be my second favorite nightwish album, next to \\"century child\\". If you don't have that album yet, (or this one) BUY THEM RIGHT NOW!<br /><br />This is an album for current nightwish fans. If you are trying to get other people to listen to them though, you should probably go easy with the album \\"oceanborn\\" first.
B000068IEU|5.0|Thirty seven years ago my fiance and I saw this movie at the drive-in theater. I have never forgotten it. That's how powerful a thriller this movie is. I couldn't believe Wes Craven re-made it, but with the best of cinimetography that makes the new 2008 much better, I will probably say this 1972 movie still was the scariest. And I watched the 2008 version with my fiance of then, now my husband. Maybe this horror flick kept love alive.

0385504225|1.0|Please forgive me for having taken artistic liberties with the much-superior Judith Viorst books, but this seemed to be the best description I could think of.<br /><br />Let me start again here...  I loved 'Da Vinci Code'.  I did & I'm not embarrassed to admit that!  :)  The storyline was unique & the overall concept was compelling.  Like most others, I quickly moved onto 'Angels & Demons'.  I found that entry less compelling - still with its entertaining moments, but not a good, fun read.<br /><br />When Dan Brown finally rolled out this long-awaited follow-up, I was quite eager to get my hands on it.  To my complete dismay, this book is terrible.  I find Brown's style of writing juvenile.  Many of his chapters end with some type of cliffhanger (similar to daytime soap operas).  However, by using this style of writing, the reader is manipulated to feel tension/stress (similar to the cheap scares offered by Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers movies).<br /><br />This is not to say that the book contains light material.  Quite the contrary.  His book is filled with complicated, well-researched storylines.  However, this rang false.  He spends so much time describing the back story that I have hardly enough time to care about the characters, as I've just wasted valuable brain cells trying to understand the bizarre back story, including Noetic science & the freemasons.<br /><br />Admittedly, Brown's writing style is likely no different from 'Da Vinci Code'.  But, these points are so over-used that it becomes distracting.<br /><br />I'm just very disappointed, as an avid reader & one that enjoys a fun, enjoyable 'light' read as much as anyone else.  The fact that Brown took 5 years to develop this book led me to expect much greater things.  Sadly, that wasn't the case; please just save your money.
0307473708|4.0|First off, I am a huge Dexter fan and the show is my favourite show on TV. I decided to check out the book to see how much the show differed and I am happy that it is different enough to be worth the read.    I enjoyed this book but the author needs to quit the repetition from chapter to chapter of the same point, ie the constant \\"if I had feelings...\\" comment about Dexter. WE GET IT. Another problem that occurs with that particular example is that a page later he'll write how Dexter is angry or another such FEELING he has. So what is it? Either he has no feelings at all or he does. The writer IMO needs to simply drop the \\"I have no feelings\\" stuff thinking that is how psychopaths are because the reality is they like everyone have some feelings. There is difference between caring and having guilt and having feelings. EVERYONE has feelings.    Another repetitive part I dislike is the lizard brain junk...again, WE GET IT. Also, what is the deal with this author and \\"farts\\" using that when saying how Dexter doesn't care: \\"I didn't give a rat's fart\\", \\"I didn't give a hummingbird's fart\\"...is this supposed to be funny? It sounds like that was written for a 6 year old.    I also feel he goes into detail a bit too much at times (often repeating himself) and seems to be done just to lengthen the book. I know that detail is good in print but there comes a point where authors need to grasp that readers can figure things out and/or use their imagination. He also uses the wrong word at times which I suppose is more an issue with the editor not correcting it than the author.    So for me, this is a good book but there is no way it is superior to the show with the show having more depth and simply better writing. I am happy he wrote it since it obviously led to the show and we all benefited from that.    I just started the second book and am noticing the exact same issues as stated above which is a shame but sadly, expected.

B00263J69K|2.0|I used to read quite a lot of Ken Follett's books until I read A Place Called Freedom.  I found it to have been very badly written but I slogged on, in the mistaken belief that his writing would get better and generously decided that he'd been having an off day. I read Pillars of the Earth when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed it and I rushed to buy World Without End - I finished it. Alas, Ken Follett is having more than an off day.  I admire the research he must have done to write this book, but in his research he forsook his writing style. I would like to think I had the patience to re-read Pillars of the Earth and see if it was as enjoyable and as well written as I had initially thought.   I would like to think I have the patience, but I know I haven't.  I am unable to recommend the book at all as as it is so very badly written.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|Tokyo Godfathers / B0001EFTVA<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />When a trio of hopeless homeless 'bums' find an infant child thrown out in the trash on Christmas Eve, they are shocked and eventually angered that anyone would so callously dispose of a child. They decide to take the time, effort, and precious resources to scour the cold and unfeeling city for the mother of the lost infant, so that she can explain how she could throw out her baby. What they don't expect is the journey of pain, discovery, and healing that their journey brings them.<br /><br />I generally tend to dislike 'journey' movies, because my heart strings can be tugged way too easily, and I leave the movie feeling drained and exhausted. However, I truly loved every second of \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\". Beneath all the pain, sorrow, and emotional heartbreak, there is genuine humor and an indomitable human spirit. It is fascinating to see how each of the three homeless have given up all hope in their *own* selves and lives, and yet they can't accept to see their companions give up their own hopes and dreams. This unlikely trio, composed of a young girl, an older man, and a homosexual transsexual, love each other dearly but aren't above heated arguments and disputes.<br /><br />I would say it is possible that this movie is the most lovingly sensitive movie ever, towards all of its characters. Each character in this movie - and not just the 'main' ones - are fleshed out as real, three-dimensional characters. The homosexual transsexual 'Hana' is feisty and a common source of comic relief, but Hana's humanity is never sacrificed in service to humor. Gin could easily be portrayed in an unflattering light, based on his secret past, and yet he is always treated with quiet dignity. And young Miyuki is realistically portrayed as a confused and frightened young teenager, encased in a tough shell for protection from her own fears. The treatment of the homeless is always lovingly gentle - there is no false suggestion that these three are just 'too lazy' to find work, indeed it is probably more \\"work\\" being homeless than not! Instead, they are realistically shown as homeless because their spirit is broken and they no longer have any faith in themselves. It is telling that it takes a truly helpless child for them to find the strength to reenter the world that has hurt them and seek to heal their own hurts.<br /><br />Seriously, after a single viewing, I am ready to label \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" as one of the best movies ever - the combination of sensitivity, humor, spirit, and real character development is a work of art and a thing of beauty.

Instead, they are realistically shown as homeless because their spirit is broken and they no longer have any faith in themselves. It is telling that it takes a truly helpless child for them to find the strength to reenter the world that has hurt them and seek to heal their own hurts.    Seriously, after a single viewing, I am ready to label \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" as one of the best movies ever - the combination of sensitivity, humor, spirit, and real character development is a work of art and a thing of beauty.

B001HN69AE|1.0|I don't know where to begin on the reasons why I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I am a huge Dragonball fan and it has nothing to offer the fans of the series. As for new people watching it I would still go against it. So Goku is being trained by Gohan who found him in his yard trying to prepare him for the possible return of Piccolo who is from the planet Namek and according to this movie all Nameks are evil. When Goku turns 18 he has the possibility of changing into a demon named Osaru which is his great ape form. Goku never has a tail in this movie period. Everyone he meets knows martial arts in this movie except for Bulma and Yamcha. Bulma makes inventions still, but other than that she is a complete idiot. I don't get how she makes anything in the movie. The Dragon Radar also got changed to the DBE for Dragon Ball Energy. The ancient Dragon Balls also seem to have no rhyme or reason for how they actually ended up on the planet. Oh finally Goku could become the Avatar since the Kamehameha in this movie is a form of airbending though it can light things on fire.<br /><br />So I mentioned why you should avoid it so far just by being a fan of the original series. Well the plot makes no sense. Osaru and Piccolo were defeated 2,000 years ago and now Piccolo is on a rampage looking for the Dragon Balls. They don't explain how Piccolo returned and Osaru came from the sky 18 years ago so he just happens to be their to help. Osaru as mentioned above is Goku, but they don't really explain why he has a human form at all. He can only change during a Solar Eclipse which is a rare event and if he isn't in his Osaru form, well he's a good guy. That means his transformation should only last a limited time at best. Goku however can fight the transformation which also is not really explained well, but you see him just change back because he wants to. The acting is horrible and if they stuck with the original story were Goku is only 12, a 12 year old could have done a better job. Bulma's actress is by far the worse of the actors in the movie and she even sounds like an idiot. She also doesn't have any common sense and yet she has like a Phd and all of this other stuff in the movie.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor even if you are just curious about how bad this movie is and don't watch it. If someone asks you too and it's free to watch it once, don't do it. I got that opportunity and I still feel like I was ripped off. I want my time back.ob.

B002MAQSAC|5.0|Here is a review from my daughter Leela who is in 7th grade in Woodrow Wilson Middle School, Edison NJ....    The Battle of the Labyrinth, Rick Riordan  Great Britain: Puffin Books, 2008. pp 342.    Rick Riordan's The Battle of the Labyrinth is a captivating and enthralling read. The book combines science fiction, fantasy and ancient Greek mythology into one action-packed experience. Fans of fantasy will love this adventure featuring a fourteen year old boy facing and army of monsters led by an evil Titan lord.  Percy and his friends embark on a quest into the enormous and ever growing labyrinth of Daedalus.  I could not put this book down until I finished it, even for mealtimes and bathroom breaks, in spite of my bladder's constant objections!     As the fourth book in a series of five enticing novels, it brings familiar characters to uncomfortable teenage concerns like romance and dating. This is an unusual twist in a series that has so far focused on the themes of  friendship, courage and loyalty. The Percy Jackson series has been a breakthrough for the talented author, Rick Riordan. This particular novel exceeds my expectations for a good read, including believable yet heroic characters, lots of action, and a smooth flow of ideas and plot throughout the book.     \\"The last thing I wanted to do was blow up another school,\\" says Percy, after he destroys a school in the process of defeating two powerful she-demons. But in Percy's life, the life of a half god and half mortal, destroying schools by \\"battling the cheerleading squad,\\" is not the biggest problem in his life. In this novel Percy and his friends Annabeth, Grover and Tyson go on a quest into the ever-changing labyrinth. Their mission is to stop Luke, an old friend who has chosen to be fighting against the gods, from destroying camp Half-blood, the safe haven for half Olympian heroes.  However, they cannot see clearly through the Mist, a magical force that prevents humans from seeing the true appearance ofcreatures that have been described in Greek myths. In turn, they cannot find their way through the labyrinth. It takes Percy a visit from Hera, the Queen of Olympus, and a few near death experiences to realize he already knows the answer to his problems, and the solution to the maze. The heroes leave the labyrinth to, as Mr. Riordan puts it, \\"hire a new guide.\\" This, however, brings a new conflict between Annabeth and Percy.     Next, along with a friend who has much more than 20/20 vision, they travel towards the heart of the labyrinth in an attempt to discourage Daedalus from helping Luke. On the way, they find an entrance to a place where the monster army is camped. Percy uses a baseball cap that gives him the power of invisibility to sneak inside. What Percy finds is a horrible and tragic sight, the return of the greatly feared titan lord, Kronos.     This book is a fantastic example of a story that brings ancient mythology into modern times. It suggests that this world contains another layer of reality that ordinary people don't comprehend. In this book all of the ancient myths are a part of Percy's daily life. Monsters and Gods alike bring a new challenge into the lives of all the half-bloods. It proposes so many new ideas that it really stimulates the readers imagination. When compared to another fantasies, this novel is unique in it's own way of combining the ancient and modern into a seamless whole. The whole premise of the book, of the children of the ancient gods living in a modern world and fighting ancient foes, is different from any other I have read.     Over all, this book is an outstanding display of imagination and action. The Greek mythology involved in the plot gives the book a historical feel, making the book even more fascinating. So, with larger than life characters that each demonstrate a realistic combination of good as well as evil, and a smoothly flowing plot, the Battle of the Labyrinth is one of the best novels I have ever read!
1416594787|5.0|This is a seminal work in the evolutionary canon.  The opening section on the distinction between the lay vs. scientific definitions of the word theory, while ridiculous that it has to be made, is crucial.  Those who argue that the book lacks a formal 'disproving' of ID or Creationism obviously are COMPLETELY missing the point.  Would a person writing a book to explain the scientific evidence for the heliocentric model be expected to refute the geocentric model?  Would a person writing a book to explain the scientific evidence for germ theory be expected to refute the humoral theory of illness?  Etc. Etc...<br /><br />Evolution is a fact.  Dawkins shows you why.  Done and done.

1573300403|4.0|I love this video! I have played 'The Earth Song' so many times because the words move me so.  'Blood on the Dance Floor' had me trying to dance like Michael.  I wish that Michael and Janet had done more videos together. I love both of their voices and music style. I didn't like Janet 'giving the finger' in the video nor them using the 'f' word (the word is partially bleeped out), and especially since Michael was such an advocate for the children, but I guess we have to have a flaw somewhere.  I really felt Michael as I listened to 'Childhood' and I wish that the public could have really known him; not just what the tabloids put out there about him.
B00288KNL8|5.0|My kids select this movie every time I ask what do you want to watch there is just something about it that makes you want to watch it over and over again.  Makes a great halloween movie for kids.
0439023491|4.0|I have only started reading this book just the other day and even though I havent actually finished it yet it has already exceeded my expectations and I think it is even better than the first. It has been like visiting old friends reading this book so far. I also love how Gale & Peeta are turning out in the 2nd book. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I havent finished it yet. Highly recommend this series though.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Heavily layered with meaning, the protagonist goes from person to person listening to everything from expositions on Existentialsim to Lucid Dream Work.  If you can keep your opions out of it until the end and merely WITNESS - merely watch and listen, I promise you will find gold and your inner voice will definitely speak to you.      Highly, highly, recommended.
B00005JOA0|4.0|This made for TV is packaged well and is typical of all the good BBC made for TV series, well cast, well acted and an interesting story line, has a Jane Eyre feel to it.  There is mystery and intrigue aplenty and as the story unfolds you begin to understand the reasons why some of the characters act the way they do.  My wife and I enjoyed it although I do not think that it would be suitable for all ages as it is a bit deep in parts and you would spend time explaining things to the younger members of the family.
B002C6A6F4|5.0|My whole family really enjoyed it.  You don't have to know \\"Hannah Montana\\" to enjoy the message and music this film provides.    The Bonus features were a lot of fun and informational for behind-the-scenes.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|Saw this at the movies with my daughter who loves Hannah and has all the tv series released here in Australia.  I love that the same type of storyline continues with the movie.  It is good family entertainment, loved the Hoedown Throwdown and purchased the soundtrack from itunes after I saw the movie and it is a regular in the music selection for the house.  If you like Hannah Montana then you will enjoy the movie.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I've seen Michael on tv and in his videos, and even in Concert at the Dodger Statium....BUT after I saw this video  it made me realize even more of how special this guy really was...there will never be anyone more talented and amazing as him......may god bless him and may he now be at peace...this was the best video I have ever seen on Michael
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Now that the hype of The Dark Knight has died down, it's time to remember the original Tim Burton film. Now I know I previously praised that film but the original is undoubtedly the best. Michael Keaton is my favorite of all the movie incarnations. Kilmer was OK and Clooney was just a joke. Bale does a good job and I commend him on actually using two different voices for Bruce and Batman but not in this manner. Sounds like he has lung cancer or something. Now Keaton does use a different voice; he subtly lowers his voice. And when Bale is in his Bruce Wayne persona, he acts to hard to through people off. When Keaton was cast as Batman, there was a public outcry as people couldn't picture him as Batman. Isn't that how it's supposed to be? You shouldn't suspect him at all. The suit in this film is way better than in the films to follow (except Returns as that was pretty much the same suit with minor alterations). It's classic Batman. Keaton handles the action well and the quiet moments are standout (there aren't really any quiet moments [except in Returns] in any of the sequels). Kim Basinger is good as Vicki, noting that she's essentially a knockoff of Lois Lane back in the 50s. And she's a much better actress than Holmes/Gyllenhal (or however you spell her name) in the newer films. They look like clueless teens who somehow ended up in a big superhero film. And Nicholson is my favorite modern live-action Joker. Not to knock Heath Ledger, he was good too, but the way Nicholson played him is actually the way the Joker should be played; a psychopathic clown who commits his crimes with a flair for the theatrical. If he's gonna kill ya, he's gonna do it in style. Billy Dee Williams should've had more screen time as Harvey Dent and he was contracted to play Two-Face but he was paid out and we got...over-the-top Tommy Lee Jones. Michael Gough's Alfred is good but I prefer the Michael Caine version as he's more involved with things. Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gordon is hardly in the film to really critique so Gary Oldman's version is better. Danny Elfman delivers with the music, providing a theme for Batman that rivals John Williams' Superman, but the actual person conducting the orchestra is none other than Shirley Walker, the woman who would provide the music for Batman: The Animated Series and most of its subsequent spin-offs.in the film to really critique so Gary Oldman's version is better.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|PHANTASM has fared pretty well on home video over the years with 3 VHS editions that I am aware of, 3 laserdisc issues and so far two (region 1) DVD releases (where's the bluray?).  This latest version from Anchor Bay is the first time we have gotten an anamorphic release and it sure is nice to have it.  Anchor Bay generally does an amazing job at putting together all sorts of cool extras and animated menus for their releases and they do a fairly good job here.  The anamorphic transfer on this DVD does not seem to me to be the same print used for the MGM and laserdisc releases. I think this transfer looks a little more grainy and the color a little more off than the previous DVD. It looks okay but it isn't remarkable in any way. I suppose this could be because I'm now watching on a large HD screen and flaws are more apparent than before. It is difficult to compare this print accurately with the previous non-anamorphic ones.  The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack sounds the same as the previous releases and it is quite good however this new DVD DOES NOT include the original mono soundtrack that was provided on the MGM release.  There are a couple of new extras exclusive to this Anchor Bay edition.  There is a short version of the PHANTASMAGORIA documentary and some interview segments called ACTORS HAVING A BALL.  Those are the only features that are exclusive to this release.  The commentary track is the same one I have been listening too since the collectors edition LaserDisc.  Strangely, there are things MISSING from this Anchor Bay DVD that were on the LaserDisc and MGM DVD.  There are ten minutes of deleted scenes on the MGM and only 8 minutes here (2 deleted scenes are missing).  Angus Scrimm in australia doing his tall man schtick is not included on this release.  The Coscarelli/Scrimm TV interview is here though, as are cleaned up versions fo the trailers and TV ads.  There are NO radio spots included on this one, also gone is the Angus Scrimm introduction to the film (anespecially sad ommission by Anchor Bay). The stills gallery is not included and neither is the complete version of \\"Sittin Here At Midnight\\" by Bill Thornbury, or the \\"Disco Phantasm\\" music tracks.  We do get the Fangoria convention footage. One big improvment is the restoration of the original poster art for the front cover. This is also a two sided DVD cover in a transparent keepcase that has cool inside cover photography and a disc that looks like a silver sphere. This is a far from a definitive video release of PHANTASM but the anamorphic transfer makes this the best edition we have gotten so far.  And by the way, I think PHANTASM is the greatest horror film ever made.
0780631684|5.0|The first Final Destination is actually a really good horror film.  It's significantly better than the third Final Destination movie (that's the one with the carnival and roller-coaster ride segment, right?  I like this one a LOT more).    The only flaw with this film is that the first 20 minutes start off rather predictable, but give the story some time to develop and I believe you'll find yourself really getting into it.    Maybe it's just me, but I found it kind of disrespectful that they'd keep playing John Denver's classic \\"Rocky Mountain High\\" throughout the film.  The song plays whenever something bad is about to happen.    It's disrespectful because, as you probably know, John Denver lost his life in an airplane accident a few years before this movie was created and released.  The writers should have honestly picked a different song.      Now about the storyline.  Are you the kind of person that believes you can cheat death?  If so, do you believe if you happen to cheat death that death will rear its head shortly after in ANOTHER attempt to take your life?  These are the kind of serious and curious questions that many of us probably ask ourselves, and these same questions are the reason this kind of horror is a few steps above the generic slasher kind (and honestly, slasher flicks are the kind of horror stories have been done to the point of exhaustion by this point).    I often wonder about these questions personally, though obviously it's important not to let these questions interfere with enjoying your life.  But it makes you wonder exactly what your destiny is and when it will happen, doesn't it?    Anyway, great horror suspense.
0385504225|2.0|If I had bought this book as I previously planned, I would be demanding my money back. Thankfully I have good friends that don't mind loaning me a book before they read it. I returned it with no comment. I will let my friend decide for himself that this book is awful. If I want to be preached to, I will go to church, not read a book that is supposed to be a thriller. I can give my entire opinion in one sentence. When it appears that Robert Langdon is dead, I was truly hoping he was gone for good so there can be no more books with him as the central character. Die already, I don't even like you anymore.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse has put out another solid CD of great music. The Queen influence is present as usual which I love. They are also are a lot more artier on this one. The piano work is amazing in a semi-classical framework. I'm not too fond of their songs that sound too poppy U2ish but this CD moves away from this to a degree and challenges the listener. Overall this is a good effort from a band that certainly has some prog in them.

B00260HH3K|2.0|Okay, how about a review and not a rant?    Dragonball, the Manga turned Anime was a lot of things but mostly it was zany. Filled with corny charm thanks to Akira Toriyama's sense of humor it followed the adventures of a young, precocious and extremely self-assured adventurous young boy named Goku and the friends he meets and makes along the way.    This movie, sadly, is really none of those things. Here we have a teen-aged Goku that is forced into the Hollywood-esque cookie cutter of powerful teenage boy that lacks self-confidence and must deal with bullies in High-school, albeit in a slightly different way than we're used to. He's not scared he just tries very hard to do as his Grandfather wishes. Okay, this is for fans to complain about but what about someone seeing it for the first time?    Where this film's version of Goku fails is the sometimes on-again off-again confidence of Goku. One scene he is pensive the next he is arrogant.    At times the script contradicted itself through its characters regarding major story elements, i.e. Prometheus Globe / Dragon Ball(s).    Bulma and her guns. I don't remember Bulma ever being a female Mod version of Dirty Harry? Odd choice considering this film felt as if it was geared towards 5-10 year old American kids.    Okay, some cons overall:    Capsule technology: Did we really need more Transformer-esque morphing vehicles with their heavily angular design? It seems this movie could have actually borrowed from Akira Toriyama's designs and gave it a unique look with new and unique CGI effects to marvel at. Instead we got the same old, same old.    The story was relatively dull and oozed \\"I've seen this done better\\" feel throughout. It didn't feel inspired in anyway. While the performances were generally good (or at least serviceable) the only real stand-out was Joon Park as Yamcha. Despite some character changes, he acted and sounded very much like the source character and carried a charisma that felt lacking from the otheractors.    Considering this film is actually filled with talented actors that have carried other films quite competently, I can only blame the director for what seems to be a lack of charisma and cohesion between characters overall.    Some fan specific complaints    1.) Almost completely ignored the source material and altered some of the plot that completely changes these characters potential future.    2.) The Heavy, Piccolo, played by James Marsters was virtually non-existent in this film and when he was in a scene he was forgettable. Very odd considering Marsters stands out in just about every other thing he has done.    3.) Goku in High School? Yikes. It goes without saying that this character was altered so much as to become a different character completely yet going by the same name. What I found most odd regarding how they changed Goku is that the Original pre-teen Goku (from the Manga/Anime) appealed to me greatly. I remember thinking, \\"Wow! This kid is self reliant and not afraid of anything! I wish I was that way!\\" And hence, I fell in love with the character. This film's sort of \\"everyman\\" Goku came off as very dull.    4.) The man sized Oozaru as Goku's transformation form. Huh? Man-sized? While it/he looked kind of cool for live action, he was just the size of a big man.    5.) Akria Toriyama's sense of humor was SORELY missing in this film.    6.) This Earth was simply a future version of our own. Gone was the alternate Earth from the manga/anime and its unique culture/geography, art design and almost allegorical/fairy-tale feel.    7.) This film isn't even 90 minutes long? Very strange considering Dragon Ball and DBZ always carried a very epic (in some cases too epic) feel to them.    I could go on (and on and on, actually) but I think I've blustered enough. If you are a fan of the Manga and/or Anime as I am, do yourself a favor and don't bother.    If you're new to Dragon Ball, go out and rent the Anime, it is one of Akira Toriyama's visions (theother and probably more pure is the Manga) and is by far superior to this film despite its later episode flaws.    If you are looking to entertain a group of 5-10 year olds, this movie is MEH at best and you would do better renting/buying any number of other films or better yet the original Anime.

B001B1T7BU|5.0|There are certain roles that actresses are born to play and Glenn Close was born to portray Cruella DeVille in \\"101 Dalmatians\\". Sure the puppies are adorable little creatures and Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson are a cute-looking couple, but Glenn is magnificent as the evil Cruella who wants the puppies destroyed to make a coat. Based on the animated Disney feature of the same name from 1961, Glenn must have studied the cartoon characterization of Cruella closely because everything from her voice patterns to her movements and eye gestures are identical to the original, and that was animation! A great film for the entire family, both young and old, I never get tired of watching this classic live-action feature. What the message of the film shows is that if your an evil person only looking out for yourself there are definite consequences; the villin always gets it in the end. Hugh Laurie(from TV's \\"House\\" fame) has a small supporting role playing one of the puppy thieves working for Cruella. This film has grossed so far over $300,000,000 at the world-wide boxoffice. A sequel entitled \\"102 Dalmatians\\", also starring Close, was released, but wasn't as successful.
B0018LMZO4|4.0|Like the other early Moody Blues alblums I found the sound to be an improvement over the original recording. The bonus tracks are mostly different versions of the original songs, but they are essentially a freebie considering the modest cost. In Search of a Lost Chord and especially Long Distance  Voyager also benefitted from the remaster IMHO.       I would like to hear other opinions on whether or not the new SACD (hi-def audio) is worth the costly investment for the equipment and cd's, unlike the $2-3 premium for this remaster, they are quite expensive. Is it worth it?

031604461X|1.0|WARNING--SOME SPOILERS!!!!    The conclusion of the Bella/Edward love series.  Bella finally graduates, gets married to Edward and they celebrate their honeymoon.  Bella seduces Edward, they have sex and she gets pregnant (it's never made clear HOW Edward can get her pregnant considering he's undead!).  The book is OK up till then.  Then it gets boring and needlessly bloody.  Bella's agony through pregnancy is just downright disgusting.  Graphic and incredibly bloody.  Then Jacob pops up and he whines for about 200 pages about if him and Bella can still be friends after she becomes a vampire.  Then the book grinds to a halt. The characters go on and on and ON about the same things again and again.  By page 500 I really could have cared less...so I stopped.  The big question (will Bella become a vampire or not) is answered long before then so everything after was anticlimatic.  Also Jacob's whining was getting to me.  I have the special edition with the drawing of Edward and Bella and a DVD of the Twilight Concert Series.  They're OK but not interesting enough to buy this.  Boring, bloody and tedious.  A terrible end to an enjoyable series.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Loosely based upon Isaac Asimov's story, Will Smith's I, Robot is good. I rarely have anything good to say about such adaptations but this detective story set in a future in which robots are commonplace is well-done and gripping. Although I think the key plotline of following \\"breadcrumbs,\\" or deliberately set clues, could have been done better the special effects are for the most part impressive and believable. The acting was good and I was pleased to watch it.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Bat Out Of Hell albums are always unique, we fans tend to compare the three 'Bats' with each other and contemplate which is better and why. We mustn't forget, however, the first one was recorded in 1977, the second in 1993, and this one, the latest to date, in 2006. Three different eras meaning music must have changed over the 29 years during which the three 'Bats' were recorded. So, in  my opinion it is hard and maybe impossible to compare them with each other and is a waste of time. Compare 'Bat I' with 'Dead Ringer' - same era, all the songs on these two albums were written by Jim Steinman. Still 'Bat I' is definitely better than 'Dead Ringer.' Going back to 'Bat III' when I buy a CD from my favourite bands or performer I always listen to them in the evening without interruption, I try to relax and listen to what my spirit does with me and how I feel. When I was listening to 'Bat III' I had such a fantastic feeling I had never had before. That is why I say this album, for me, is the best I have ever listened to - no matter how many songs were written by Steinman. Thank you Meat for the music.

B001TODCII|5.0|Possible spoilers<br /><br />Action films when done right can be a great form of escapism, (The \\"Die Hard\\" Films, \\"Face/Off\\") however some are just plain bad, (\\"Wanted\\" anyone?).<br /><br />\\"Taken\\" is a very and I mean very bare bones action flick that stars Liam Neeson (\\"Les Miserables\\" \\"Batman Begins\\") as Bryan Mills a retired government agent who goes to look for the men who took his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, \\"The Fog\\" and T.V.'s \\"Lost\\") while she and a friend were on a trip in Paris.<br /><br />Mills finds out from a longtime friend of his that these men take young traveling girls and sell them as prositutes on the black market. So with this information and a ticking clock off Mills goes.<br /><br />After the first 30-35 minutes, the film is mainly one action sequence after another as Mills' search for his daughter takes him all over Paris and other parts of France, I'm guessing at least since a lot of loactions were never fully specified.<br /><br />There's a really cool chase scene throughout a construction site where some men are holding some of the girls. Almost every action portion involves Mills using skills he learned over the years (basically how to kill) to get information and take down people to get his daughter back.<br /><br />The action is great, fast paced and of course mostly ridiculous. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly throwaway characters and stereotypical bad guys, though Famke Janssen has a small role as Mills ex-wife and of course is Kim's mother.<br /><br />Personally as silly and goofy as the film can be and is, it's a ton of fun and flies by quickly though given the 85 minutes running time it's not suprising. If you want non-stop bare bones action pick up \\"Taken\\" and enjoy. 3.5 out of 4 stars.

0385504225|1.0|I enjoyed reading Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, but thought Angels and Demons was mediocre at best.  This book can be compared with Angels and Demon - disappointing.  The subplot was ridiculous and the book dragged on and on - I ended up skimming quite a bit and only read to the end because I felt obligated to read what I bought.  I would not recommend this book.  Don't waste time or money on this one.

B002E9HACG|5.0|You've got to hand it to Europe.....they really know how to rock out. When many bands half their age are already going soft and selling out, Europe continues to up the hard rock ante.<br /><br />Sure, this album, as a whole, is not quite as bombastic as it's predecessor, \\"Secret Society,\\" but there are more songs with hooks on this album. The title track is epic, and will stick in your head. The ballad \\"New Love in Town\\" seems to blend together earlier hits \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Prisoner in Paradise\\" and add a little blues touch into the mix. \\"The Beast\\" is a hard rock track that sounds as if it could have come right off of their earliest albums. \\"U Devil U\\" and \\"Gonna Get Ready\\" begin with a bad*** slow, grinding beat and burst into big melodic choruses. The album blends the sounds of old Europe and new Eurpoe, and does so effectively.<br /><br />Not every track is perfect, though. \\"Catch that Plane\\" sounds monotone, and the album loses considerable steam as it winds down, but it is redeemed by the inclusion of the two live tracks, which are incredible performances that inject life into the album to close it out on a great note. Europe may have sung \\"The Final Countdown\\" back in 1987....but as \\"Only Young Twice\\" proves, this band has new life and they are living it, apparently, to the fullest. If this is what a midlife crisis sounds like, I cannot wait for mine to begin! 4.5 stars.

0385504225|2.0|Having read all of DB's books, beginning with DCode and then progressing through his other works, I started off enthralled with the story-lines and characters and have been increasingly disappointed with each book I read next.  As many others here have pointed out, Brown's plotlines, characters, and key events are very predictable.  And once you start realizing this as you progress through the book, other aspects of the book become rather predicatble and repetitive as well, such as the character dialogue.  Some of the events in this book are pretty extreme (out-there) and you would expect some intense reactions from the characters but some of the characters still seem to behave over-dramatically.    One serious gripe I have with Brown's writing is the dialogue he creates between characters.  Though it's not all bad, parts of these dialogues are seriously corny, unrealistic, predictable, odd, etc.  Seriously, everytime I read parts in his books involving student-teacher dialogue in the classroom or lecture hall, I cringe because it's so bad.  He should check out a college class or two in progress and see how students really talk and behave in lectures, even those classes they are interested in.  Students don't talk this way. People don't talk this way!!  Also, Brown has got to try out something different from the \\"Damsel in distress\\" routine. The lady is always with Langdon, she's always lost a close male friend or relative, she's always single...  Hey I'm all for Langdon getting some during a story but can't it just be with a random girl who plays a much smaller role in the plot?
0439023483|5.0|The new YA novel that everyone seems to be talking about is worth the buzz. This was the most fun I've had reading in months.<br /><br />In an unspecified dystopian future, the Hunger Games are at once a contest and a tool of political intimidation. Every year, children from a dozen subjugated regions of the former United States are chosen to compete in a brutal fight to the death. Participation is mandatory, and the Games are televised throughout the world.<br /><br />The story follows Katniss, a 16-year-old girl whose skill with a bow has kept her family from starving in their impoverished district. She's a thoroughly believable character, tough, independent, and even a little cold--it's a rough world, after all--but also suffering from the characteristic flaws of the age, most notably blindspots about her own appeal and the motivations of those around her. Sometimes the POV in young adult books can creep me out, like an adult squeezing into a child's clothing, but Collins nails it, and the book is just flat-out riveting.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00004X10B|5.0|This bag holds more than most bags in terms of clean, organized groups of equipment. I fit 2 full sized dSLRs (Canon 1D series bodies). One with lens attached. 5 lenses including a 70-200 2.8, 24-70 2.8, 17-40 f4, and 2 prime lenses. Also packed in the bag were 2 external flashes, cards, batteries, and misc little gadgets I use on a regular basis. Once filled, it weighed quite a bit, but still felt comfortable considering the weight on my shoulder. This bag is great for long trips when luggage space is limited. I can't stand rollers, so I found this to be the best fit for me. For shooting sports/nature/portraits/ etc... this bag can take whatever you throw at it. For the price? It's a no-brainer. I'd recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for more space to lug camera/video equipment. My favorite feature of the bag is probably the external pockets which are designed so well (IMHO). They are easy to use and organize with as well. They fit cards/batteries/flashes perfectly. It's like they designed it specifically for a professional photographer! Who'd a thunk?
1416594787|5.0|Wow!  Richard Dawkins' new book, The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is awesome!  Dawkins presents a well-organized and compelling case for the fact of physical, biological, and cultural evolution, and he writes for the general public in clear, understandable language.  I predict this book will quickly become a classic.  The last two paragraphs on page 426 brought me to tears.<br /><br />Religious leaders should pay special attention to pages 7 and 8 and thus heed Dawkins' warning:<br /><br />\\"All too many preachers, while agreeing that evolution is true and Adam and Eve never existed, will then blithely go into the pulpit and make some moral or theological point about Adam and Eve in their sermons without once mentioning that, of course, Adam and Eve never actually existed!  If challenged, they will protest that they intended a purely 'symbolic' meaning, perhaps something to do with 'originial sin', or the virtues of innocence.  They may add witheringly that, obviously nobody would be so foolish as to take their words literally.  But do their congregations know that?  How is the person in the pew, or on the prayer-mat, supposedly to know which bits of scripture to take literally, which symbolically?  Is it really so easy for an uneducated churchgoer to guess?  In all too many cases the answer is clearly no, and anybody can be forgiven for feeling confused. ...<br /><br />\\"Think about it, Bishop.  Be careful, Vicar.  You are playing with dynamite, fooling around with a  misunderstanding that's waiting to happen - one might even say almost bound to happen if not forestalled.  Shouldn't you take greater care, when speaking in public, to let your yea be yea and your nay be nay?

B001U7FWM8|5.0|I found this band out of nowhere.  I believe I was actually reccomended this from amazon.  It's like nothing I've listened to, but I can't stop listening to it.  I listened to \\"Two Weeks\\" and kicked myself to go out and buy the cd.  When I listened to it a few times through, I completely abandoned listening to anything else.<br /><br />Grizzly Bear is a slow, moody band, with strongly creative songs that resemble bands from the deep past.  The only band I listen to that comes close to them is Dredg.  They're their own genre I believe.  I was afraid I'd buy the cd and only enjoy \\"Two weeks\\" but I was very impressed with the complimentary tracks.  I enjoy all of them save \\"Hold Still\\".  Aside from that track, I can listen to the whole cd day in day out.  So I invite you to preview \\"Two Weeks\\" and maybe \\"Ready Able\\" and see if you can become drawn in.<br /><br />If you like Radioheads slow emotionality, mixed with a floatback to Beatles/Doors era, then I think you'll get a lot out of Veckatimest.  The great thing about it is that it's really cheap.  It contains the most value out of a cd that I've seen in ages.  Pick it up and let the music move you.

I wrote to the seller to tell them of this problem, but they never offered to replace the cases.  Jewel cases are inexpensive, so I just bought my own.  But, seller should package better.
B002BIULQC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I bought movie tickets for the movie almost a month before it premiered. I expected a lot from the movie, and it did not disappoint at all. The acting was great, especially by Miley, as usual she was very good. Story, plot, everything about the movie was very good. I would put it as my favorite movie of the year ahead of Transformers 2, but just because I am big Miley fan :). This is an amazing deal too, the fact that you get the Blu-Ray of the movie, a DVD version, AND a Digital Copy, which now I'm able to watch it on my iPhone wherever I go, makes this a GREAT deal. If you are a Miley fan, Hannah Montana fan, or even just a fan of Disney, this is a MUST BUY!!! 5/5 for me
0307269981|1.0|Salander gets the girls, kills the bad guys, protects the innocent, defends the weak.  Who is she superwoman?  I mean comon.  The plot was so convoluted that I had a hard time keeping track.  There were so many coincidences you would swear it was a 'vast right wing conspiracy' against her.  No wonder I don't like sequels.
0312370849|5.0|I'm a big reader of Holocaust survivor books and this one was a masterpiece.  Wow is right.  Rosnay spins an awe inspiring tale of fiction based to historical fact. It was hard for me to distinguish what was fact and what was fiction as I devoured this amazing book.  The author illuminates a little known episode in French history and makes it come alive and glow like a Thomas Kincaid painting. Sarah's innocence,  Julia's passion for journalism and her personal crisis or should I say crises endear each of them to their audience.  I made it over half way and then the tears just came- I was surprised I held them back that long.  A strong emphasis on the value of life in the past and in the present, for the young, the old and the \\"others\\" around us.
0375413405|5.0|The book meets the promise of its title.   Julie explains every process so simply and illustrates it thoroughly so that as an amateur I felt confident in trying the recipes and techniques.   It's excellent and very easy to understand.
B000Q67876|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers. This is a great movie in all respects. But I must point out its similarity to the classic 'Count of Monte Cristo'. An innocent man wrongly convicted and incarcerated in a hellish prison who finds wealth and then has revenge on his accusers. The director presents a subtle hint at this in the scene where the inmates are stocking the library. One of the books being shelved was 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. Nothing more to add except it deserves it's place as one of the all time greats.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I thought that this movie was quite well written and thought out clearly.  I do think that it could have been better but was still a very very very good movie.
0307454541|5.0|There is probably not much I can say in this review to add to the heaps of praise that this book has received.  Suffice it to say that I was absolutely sucked into it.  It puts me in mind of Kate Atkinson's mysteries...compelling and with the escapism of a good thriller - without the wooden one dimensional characters.<br /><br />I haven't read many mystery/thrillers lately, though I used to love them.  In the past view years, I've learned to enjoy books that aren't as plot driven and contrived...and appreciate more than ever, good writing.  (And editing - which sometimes makes all the difference.)<br /><br />The characters in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" are well drawn and interesting in their own right - even without the \\"disappearing from a locked room\\" type mystery that they are involved in.  It's a book that can be enjoyed on a plane, or beach or anywhere - with no need for a brown paper wrapper.  A guilty pleasure...minus the guilt!<br /><br />As proof of how much I liked the book.  I only JUST managed to wait all the way until the next day to buy Stieg Larsson's next book, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\".
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I won't repeat what many have pointed out - how idiotic the plot is and how poor the writing is. I am still not even sure what the big secret was supposed to be - a hidden Bible? However, even though most of us understand that this is a work of fiction I am afraid that some ill-informed people are going to believe the utter crap about energy fields and faith healing and forgo proven therapies believing that there is \\"noetic science\\" evidence for such garbage. It makes no real difference to human beings if someone believes that Jesus had offspring but if someone believes that prayer or a faith healer can cure his or her offspring of a serious bacterial infection easily treated by antibiotics that is something else. I wish I had spent the time reading science-based medicine and suggest that anyone gullible enough to believe anything in this book do the same.
0439023491|5.0|I love this book. I recommend these teen and up. Suzanne is a great writer and you can visualize the story. From what I understand she has written for TV. This set would make a lovely (and expensive) movie - lot's of special effects! Only disappointment is this is part 2 of 3. I can't help wanting to know it all!!!<br /><br />I wish she had more books out there - I have them all. I can't wait until my Step-Daughter (9) is old enough to read them (death + kissing = older than nine in my book). I want to by an extra set of all for her.<br /><br />I originally received part 1 from samples of books before 1 was released. I had to wait over a year for part 2. Now waiting for part 3 again! Ahh!
081095415X|5.0|A Shadow Falls must be considered one of the most important works in Wildlife Art.  Each photograph reads beautifully, and the scenery provides much more than a backdrop, it propels the viewer into the scene.  The treatments applied to each image enhance the mood of the shot beautifully and show that the artist felt the scene as he captured it.  Many scenes are so powerful as to truly humble the viewer.  The scale of the book, its layout, and the procession of imagery is perfect.  My only comment is that it would be nice for an artist's proof version to be released in the highest possible quality, as this would take the book to a neww level    I thoroughly enjoyed A Shadow Falls and would recommend the book for yourself, or as a gift to a family member or friend.  It will be appreciated forever.
630460291X|5.0|GREAT copy of a GREAT movie.  There aren't many movies that I think are worth watching over and over again, but this one is, and the copy I received through Amazon is excellent and should last forever.  Thanks, Amazon, for your wonderful products!
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden was hitting their stride as the world's premier heavy metal band when they released their fifth album, `Powerslave' in late summer 1984. Arguably this record could be considered the last of their classic era and was also the first to feature an unchanged lineup for consecutive records (a lineup that persists to this day with the addition of Janick Gers). Many consider `Powerslave' to be the definitive Maiden opus, and though I prefer the two previous records, it would hard to argue that `Powerslave' isn't their best. The album seemed to represent a true culmination of each band member's individual strengths. The songwriting was challengingly progressive as you would expect from Steve Harris, but Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith rose to the occasion as well and now all of Maiden's chief composers were working at the peak of their powers as the cracks in the `armour' would not appear for another six years. True metal classics include the powerhouse one-two punch of \\"Aces High\\" and \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\". As a perfect bookend, the LP closes with \\"Powerslave\\" and \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", two more in Iron Maiden's unchallenged onslaught through the Eighties! In between you have capable if not excellent metal with not one but two odes to mano a mano, \\"Flash of the Blade\\" and \\"Duelists\\". The harmonies woven by Murray and Smith weave a profound tapestry over which Dickinson gives his trademark wail with the rumbling of one of metal's all-time greatest rhythm sections. Maiden's reach would not overextend their grasp as they proved with another metal touchstone in `Powerslave'. In the abyss I fall, the eye of Horus...
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|The series, the scnenario, he actors, the production AND THE SOUNDTRACK is amazing. Everything is amazing about this Battlestar Galactica..  Have not seen such a good project for a long time..
B002ELM5HY|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Mark Knopfler has become as important & relevant a solo artist as he was during his Dire Straits days; in fact I will not be surprised if his solo work weathers as well or even better over time than some of the Dire Straits material.      New album on hand here; and it is a classic of sorts; and will not win a Grammy or get any airplay on commercial ridden radio stations. This one is for us!      I may be a bit biased - I have always enjoyed his singing, Dylanesque at times, Knopfleresque for the most part & his impeccable guitar playing.  He is one of the best musicians. Period. It appears, as time piles up, he is getting better at his craft, both singing and playing. Mr. Knopfler has always been a good writer - but even that is improving continually.  Songs are becoming poems, lyrics are becoming literature.      And he is on top his game here on this particular outing.  Great batch of songs - a long cycle - great words wrapped in warm glistening melody ...; a handful of master session players keeping the sound alive and thriving.     Before Get Lucky, my favorites were Sailing to Philadelphia & Golden Heart; both had deep meaningful songs, and some radio friendly tunes; this new one, based on about five or six spins so far is really growing on me. It is very comforting, erudite but relaxing at the same time. Like a long poem, or a folk ballad, enjoyed under shadow of a Gulmohar Tree in midday sun.   Like I said, a Classic of sorts - one that will grow on you, slowly & surely over time.      On a different note, Knopfler has been quietly adding scores to soundtracks over the last twenty years or so.  If you have not checked them out, I cannot tell you what your have been missing.     Dire Straits was a big thing when we were growing up. It looks like Mark Knopfler will be a big thing in my personal life as I grow older.  This Chapter ain't done yet.     Lucky me!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I lost 25 lbs. in a month, changing my diet and using this dvd as my sole source of exercise motivation. I am a very sedentary person, i.e. spending my time at the computer either working or playing mmorpgs (lol) and this is a nice way to start getting in shape.

0385504225|4.0|OK, this review is from someone who's read the entire book! Just finished it today. Four stars in general, with nothing to make it a 5-star, quite a few 3-star situations and a couple 2-star moments.     (OK, you could say the book earns the 5-star rating for simply making the information in this book so widely known and so high profile. Dan Brown's \\"next book\\" was going to reach a great number of people regardless, and I can only agree with D.Brown that the topics here are very interesting and well worth writing, well worth comparing or surpassing Da Vinci Code in importance - read the book yourself and you may agree that the topic here IS MORE IMPORTANT, though also quite harmonious, to the topics in Da Vinci Code.)    I thought it was quite an enjoyable and captivating read in general, and the information about the Ancient Mysteries, Freemasons, Washington area history and Katherine's area of research were very interesting. As so many of us are SO familiar with the Da Vinci Code and Angels And Demons, it soon becomes obvious that Dan Brown has perhaps put too much of that same story structure or character type/arrangement in The Lost Symbol. But judging the book on it's own (which was tough in a few places, where I found myself thinking \\"geez, Brown, are you really doing this, it's so much of a repeat!), I don't think the book suffers from that in any major way.     One fault I spotted and I have the same issue with most movies and books anyway, is that the creation of the \\"bad\\" character lacks some believability. In a mystery thriller, obviously that character is going to provide energy that periodically forces the story along, meaning that authors find it too easy to exaggerate the evil characters and keep them superficial comic strip creatures. Well, I found that issue here too. I would have liked the character there to be more of a reflection of social forces, but the reader is set up well to be able to reflect/extrapolate what those social forces might be.I've read other reviews here and the reviews giving 1-star and 2-star are just silly. Again, Dan Brown is not a great literature writer but his capacity to entertain while revealing the fruits of lots of research into very important subjects and delivering a great mystery thriller are excellent.    I can just imagine Ron Howard, Dan Brown and a few others sitting down over a few dozen rounds of coffee, scotch or orange juice and working out the movie version of this. Long live the top of the Washington Monument!
0738711500|5.0|This set of cards and book was the first for me.  The cards resonated with me deeply.  I now have several decks of different types and this is the one I keep coming back to.  I find the graphics visually appealing.  But unlike some of the other reviewers, I find the graphics helpful for interpretations and meanings. I find little reminders that jog my memory or give me a little tingle of intuition that gives me more accurate readings.  Of course, this is highly individual and what works for one person may or may not work for another.  No doubt about it.  I also firmly believe picking out a deck, especially a first deck, should be a hands on approach.  Ihad in my mind to purchase a Rider-Waite tarot deck as my first one.  There were dozens of decks including the RW decks, but this one just kept drawing me back and that decided my first purchase.  Simply could not put it down.  I find I connect better and can do a much more thorough reading with this particular deck.<br /><br />The book I found to be a great start to tarot.  Another reviewer mentioned the reverse for cards were not mentioned and that the descriptions were at times too brief.  This is a beginner's book.  Reverses can be intimidating and confusing.  The author clearly states that she does not use reverses herself and has better results that way.  I definitely believe when someone is comfortable with the meanings and is able to read for themselves, incorporating reverses may be something to add to their repetoire.<br /><br />This has been a perfect beginning for me.  A great foundation to build upon.
B0029LXGXG|5.0|This is Maxwell best work since Embrya. I am truly a fan and will always be. With it's live horns and well presented production and song writing, it is a 5 star album, no doubt!

B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of those rare and unique TV shows that come once every ten years.    Unique, original, well done, well written and best of all: well executed with incredible funny characters and actors.  I was hooked since episode one, but the interesting thing is that every friend I have recommended the series and/or loaned the DVDs has been hooked too inmediantly.    I have yet to meet someone who has seen the show and tell me that it doesn't like it, that's how great it is.  So, if you are planning to buy it, go ahead, you'll not regret it.  I just hope the writers know how to keep it fresh and great for seasons to come and that CBS gives the show the credit it deserves (I just feel they don't quite \\"get it\\" how exceptional this show is).
B001FB4W0W|4.0|This was a very well plotted series with many plotlines and sub stories, and personally, I thought it was one of the best series I've seen in a very long time. I would give it five stars except I can't. The sex scenes were over the top. Now don't get me wrong. I love intimate love scenes, but not hard core sex, and that is what this series had. Give me Titanic or Cold Mountain any day, but gross sex that demeans women, no thank you. If the plotlines were not so good, this would have been a one star review. I'm still undecided if I will buy the second season. I want to know who's body was in the detective's car, but I'm not sure I can stomach any more gross sex.
0743298039|5.0|Very well writen I thought. Loved the characters and the way that they looked at each others life.

0316017922|5.0|Once again Malcolm Gladwell does a tremendous investigative job. This book will change many beliefs about success, and he presents the evidence support his claims. This book is great because it helps the reader plan for personal success. Outliers will also aid the reader in helping others achieve their own success, and that's even more outstanding.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I just love this DVD!  Everyone that loves MJ's entertainment should own this.  It shows his talents in a very exciting way start to finish.  I hope to see more of his concerts on DVD someday.  Can't believe he is gone!
B001N44BVQ|5.0|Great Movie.The lead characters do a great job of playing off the American insolence with the Arab intransigence. I thought the acting was superb. The locales were right on. I continue to be amazed by both Crowe and DiCaprio. They get it. Reading the one stars, they don't. Overall, a great action and non-biased view of the way things work.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|This case is okay.  It has a strap, which is sort of nice, but I'd like it better if it were longer.  The button pops off and does not slide (at least not on mine) and so getting wipes out is a big hassle.  The case also pops open and does not seal especially well.  I was hoping this would be a good solution for me.  I need to carry lots of wipes (I have 3 young children) and the standard travel wipe cases hold approximately 6 wipes, whereas this one holds more.  I like that the case holds more wipes, but they are useless if you can't get them out or if the case opens and they all fall out on the ground.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B001DRF84W|4.0|Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) has been conducting experiments with gamma radioation until one night he tries to save a friend's life in the lab and gets blasted with a dose of radioation. Banner survivors but whenever he becomes angry or outraged becomes a powerful and superstrong green skinned brute named The Hulk who's real gentle inside but doesn't like to be messed with. General Ross (Sam Elliot) and Glen Talbot (Josh Lucas) suspects something is going wrong, Bruce's love interest Betty (Jennifer Connely) must try to help with Banner's problems and that's the same for Banner's long lost father David (Nick Nolte) who enhances himself as well to become an absorbing monster.<br /><br />Quite different Sci-fi thriller based on Marvel's comic hero created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby is directed by Ang Lee. This one maybe a bit slow for some folks and didn't too well with audiences and some critics even critized for not having much Hulk action, Lee wanted to do an artsy take on the beloved Marvel character for i thought this was a very interesting movie. The casting was quite good even to Connelly who is just as sexy as ever, the special effects by ILM is flawed on the Hulk but in the second movie he looked better. Ang Lee did tried to get a major audience but at least he tried, the new Hulk movie was a vast improvement but this is still worth a watch.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers a kickass high defination transfer and terrific sound with good extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, and featurettes plus picture-in-picture click access for interviews and behind the scenes footage as you watch the movie.

B002BE7JEI|5.0|Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a very successful writer of romance and thriller novels was driving on a snowy highway and gets into an accident. He survives thanks to a nurse named Annie (Kathy Bates) whom rescued him from danger as she takes him in her house as a guest and she is a big fan of that author who would do anything for him although she's a bit on the psychothic side as she wants him to write a new novel based on her wish fulfilment and doesn't want Sheldon to leave.<br /><br />Twisted and suspenseful horror thriller that faithfully adapts Stephen King's novel is brillantly directed by Rob Reiner and adapted by William Goldman. Laura Bacall co-stars in this shocker as it has became one of the best movies of it's kind ever, it's quite disturbing with memorable moments like the hobbling foot scene you won't forget as this movie is a solid winner.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set has a solid transfer with wonderful audio on the first DVD in high defination and the second disc has a standard def DVD with extras like featurettes, trailers and Audio Commentaries.
0385504225|4.0|[[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol<br /><br />What led you to pick up this book?<br /><br />I have seen the advertisements for months and have been looking forward to it.  I have liked Dan Brown's other books featuring Robert Langdon, so I figured this one would be good too.<br /><br />What did you like least?<br /><br />There was nothing I really disliked about the book.  The action did seem a little jumpier and did not seem to flow as smooth as in the previous books, but it did not lessen my enjoyment.<br /><br />Have you read any other books by this author? What did you think of those books?<br /><br />I have read both of the other books by Dan Brown that feature Robert Langdon.  I have enjoyed all of them.  I love the puzzle solving and the trail that leads the characters from clue to clue to solve the crisis.<br /><br />What did you think of the main character?  I love Robert Langdon.  He is exactly like one of the professors I wish I had had in college.<br /><br />What about the ending?  I do think the ending was a little anti-climatic.  This adventure did not seem as involved as in Brown's other books.  I was just wishing for a grander solution than we got.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the book.  The characters were very well-written and developed. Everyone seemed believable.  I loved CIA Inspector Soto.  Robert Langdon was great, as usual.  His sidekick. Katherine Solomon, is good and solid - but I liked Sophie from The DaVinci Code better.<br /><br />I do recommend the book if you have liked Dan Brown's previous works, but I would wait for the less expensive paperback.
B000024KNJ|5.0|I had this CD which I lost, I love Vangelis' work.  I saw this seller in a foreign country and that made me nervous however, for the extremely low price and given the fact that I could not find the CD anywhere I had searched in the U.S., I thought I'd give it a shot.  The CD arrived in excellent condition, no cracks, no scratches and I believe it may have been new too.  Delivery was a tad lengthy and yet well within the allotted time.
0785125965|5.0|Okay, I know I might get some heat from this, but I was totally for the Hulk the whole way. I hate when people tell you whats good for you and what needs to be done a crap like that. Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic, Dr. Strange, and Blackbolt all get what they derserved.    That being said, I agree with the others when they say its nothing but a summer action movie. It is, but it also has a decent story. It basically asked the question of how far should one to achieve their revenge. Pretty good question if ya ask me. And the ending kinda haunted me. It was an ending that had to happen, but still was pretty messed up. Anyway, I liked it. Personally, seeing the high and mighty Richards and Stark getting the crap beaten out of them satified me. Especially since Im Anti-Registration. Or was... Whatever!!!     Anyway, if you read Planet Hulk(which was one of the best comics Ive ever read personally) you should read this. If you like to see some of the Smartest and Strongest characters in the Marvel Universe fight the awesome Green Giant, you should definiatly pick this up
B001K98MFK|5.0|I'm glad they finally made a translated version of this movie, which they should have done from the start.  Graphics are great and the story will have you watching the movie again to actually understand it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The characters' are so well written you feel pulled into this book. It's detailed story line kept you interested from cover to cover.
B0001VTPWM|4.0|Robocop one was the best out of the other 2.  The second one you had a question of why the glass on the cop car was replaced once the car took a rocket, fliped, and glass SHATTERED.  They replaced it to have the scene where the car gets shot up before Robocop comes out.  I didn't see any other problems with the rest of the movie.  Then the third one was OK, I feel Peter Weller was the best actor for the Robocop role, but it was someone else.  You could tell that there was problem with the voice over when you stare closely at his mouth and what is actually being said.  Then what's up with making his voice more robotic when he is fully suited (helmet on)?  When ever he has his helmet off, he sounds like a regular person.  Then you have these guys from OCP wearing funny ass looking uniforms and the guy in charge of Rehab walks around without any body armour?  He must be invincible, who knows?  Besides those, it does have some good points.  It was funny how the little girl, Mariko, hacks a ED-209 when the rebels were breaking into the Police armory for weapons then some of the upgrades to Robocop was pretty good.  I only wish that they were consistent and actually reviewed every detail of their shooting before they released this movie.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|It's not Shakespeare and it's not Dr Seuss.  You've heard of Dan Brown, DVC and Angels and Demons.  You know what to expect here.  Excuse me that I'm not an elitist, pinky in the air, tea sippin' snob.  It's a book.  Read it and when you're done, move on to the next book.  At the very least, you get to spend a day running around DC.  There's no need to write a 1000+ word thesis on the book...and by the way...it's FICTION.  That means not real.  Last, how often is there an original novel these days?  PLEASE.
B000PWQPAC|3.0|The first disc that I ordered went to the title screen, but couldn't play the movie.  The second disc played, but had temporary trouble with Ch 15.  When I watched it through on the second one, the story was great and I would love to buy this.  I have contacted the companies that make this movie about the issue.  I will buy at a later date when they fix the problem.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|The movie is fantastic, as is the video and sound on this Blu-ray. Unfortunately, even though this isn't sitting on a shelf in a physical store trying to get your attention, Amazon.com ships this disc with a huge sticker on the front that screams \\"Digital Copy Included.\\"    Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but this sticker is virtually IMPOSSIBLE to remove without damaging either the special hologram on the cover or the slip cover it sits on. This isn't one of your peel-with-ease stickers that comes right off. No, it's FULLY GLUED ON, and if this package ever encountered any high temperatures when shipping, it's stuck there for good.    You will have residual glue sticking to the hologram, you'll rip off some of the black glossy covering on the slip case, some of the sticker will remain behind without any way to remove it, or your have to dig in your fingernail so deep that you'll leave a permanent dent on the cover.    If you're not concerned about stickers on your slip cases, then you might be annoyed at the shoplifting-proof packaging that increases the chances you're going to ruin your case. Why Amazon, with all its purchasing power, doesn't require manufacturers to send these Internet-only blu-rays without all the shoplifting packaging is beyond me.    Write to Amazon.com and complain about the packaging, the stickers, and the amount of hassle and garbage generated by it!    Or, if you don't care about the case and only care that the blu-ray looks good and plays well, then you should be happy with this movie. It's spectacular fantasy cinema.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|Another solid offering from DT. This one is two steps up from their last release, Systematic Chaos. It has more hooks and is more accessible from the first listen. The production on this is pristine. It has a sound similar to that used for Rush's classic \\"Moving Pictures\\" record and on The Count of Tuscany, DT visit the chimes and guitar-volume-pedal effect that Rush used on their song Xanadu. As usual with DT, this cd has its share of overplaying that bogs down the musical statement at times, but overall it is well-written and executed.     Still, this isn't the best that the band ever made. For beginning fans I would recommend Images & Words or Awake. A personal favorite is 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence, but that album doesn't have a typical sounding Dream Theater ouvre. It's generally softer and more varied in style.   Another classic DT album and fan favorite is the concept album Scenes From A Memory, with its fantastic story of a love-triangle across time.     My personal ranks for DT albums are as follows:    Images & Words  Awake  6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence  Train of Thought  Scenes From A Memory  Black Clouds & Silver Linings  Falling Into Infinity  Octavarium  Systematic Chaos    If you like your rock hard and raunchy, then Train of Thought or Awake are the ones to get. DT rock especially hard on those two.     Highlights on this one:    A Night To Remember  The Shattered Fortress  The Best of Times  The Count Of Tuscany    The Best of Times is an especially touching tribute to drummer Mike Portnoy's late father and is my favorite song on this record. The Count of Tuscany is a clever baroque-like tale of mystery with some very interesting musical passages.     Enjoyable and recommended.
0618918248|5.0|Thank you so much, Mr. Dawkins.<br /><br />I found peacefulness while reading this book.  \\"The God Delusion\\" is a must read for anyone that has the courage to look deeper into the basic ideologies that so many are too afraid to think through.  While the vast majority of the world remains enslaved and infected by the rampant, war-mongering, and dangerous lies of religions, this book is a beacon of hope for a happy and peaceful future.<br /><br />Thank you again.
B000068R1X|2.0|This album is mostly average to weak songs from Ozzy Osbourne. It came after the tragic loss of Randy Rhoads and the change of quality in the music is evident. Most fans of this kind of music won't be very discriminating, so if you're into 80s pop/metal you will probably love this. It's not without it's moments and new guitarist Jake E Lee is no Randy but steps up to the plate nicely. The title song is among Ozzy's best ever and the ballad You're No Different is pretty good as well. The rest is pretty formulaic and could've been produced by any number of 80s metal bands. Centre of Eternity is an attempt to revive the organ intro of Mr Crowley and follow it with a Black Sabbath riff-jam. Waiting For Darkness is close to a decent Ozzy song but doesn't stand well against any of his classics from his first 2 albums. I recommend this for hardcore Ozzy fans or fans of 80s metal. For a better sample of what Ozzy is famous for get Blizzard of Oz, Diary of a Madman or No More Tears.
B001AGXEA6|4.0|Disappointed that this no longer comes with the audio cd or insert booklet as it used to (no 3d slipcover either). So, its cheap now for a reason...oh well, it still looks better than the dvd right? Still recommended. GRAB/HONK!
B0002OERI0|5.0|My hat goes off to Greenday for having the guts to write this gem of a concept album. I'll bet that the majority of the American public that bought this didn't even realize or care about the message and intricacy in the lyrics, concept and flow of this masterpiece of a punk album. For those of you that noticed, welcome to the suburban world of American Idiot, where the real idiots are the listeners that are parodied without their consent or even their knowledge. For those of you that got it, lets do something to change the dismal state of affairs of this great country. Talk about it and make others see that we need to pull together and make some changes before it's too late. Kudos again to Greenday!! All the accolades, sales and praise that they received is well-deserved. This will go down in music history as one of the greatest moments in punk/rock.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Johnny's voice is spectacular. If you're a fan of Tim Burton or Johnny Depp, and definitely if you're a fan of both, this movie is for you!!!
B00009RAJI|5.0|There isn't much that can be said about Fleetwood Mac's Rumours that hasn't already been said before. 6 out of the original 11 songs on the album went on to become either hits or radio staples. The story behind the making of the album is legendary. It's surprising that no one thought about making a movie about it.     Riding high on the success of the previous \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" self-titled album, the band went into the studio to record rumours. When I say riding high, it is in more than one way, since the band members were purported to be some of the highest consumers of cocaine in the music business at the time.     Also, Stevie Nicks (singer/songwriter) was long-time girlfriend of Lindsay Buckingham's (singer/guitarist/producer/songwriter)but broke up with him and ran to drummer Mick Fleetwood. At the same time, married couple John McVie (Bassist) and Christine McVie (singer/keyboardist/songwriter) decided to get a divorce. The result was the emotionally-charged, confessional, blockbuster album Rumours. It is currently the 9th best-selling album of all time and definitely Fleetwood Mac's best ever. It is a combination of blues/folk/rock/pop with a 70s California sound that still sounds fresh today as it ever did. You won't find many albums with this consistency and appeal. This is one of those albums that is truly legendary and is oversold in any attempt to describe it. If you've never heard it and like soft-rock, you owe it to yourself to buy it.     Very Highly Recommended

B000JLQSWE|3.0|If you are curious to explore APPs music then don't start here. There are some worthy moments on this cd but you would be advised to start somewhere else. This album was meant to be used along with Ammonia Avenue to make a double album. The project was changed into two separate works and the production used for this album was changed to try to fit the times. That was a sad mistake that the APP would never recover from.     Starting with this album from 1985 the quality of their work diminished and APP faded from the music scene and would not resurface with another great album until 1996's On Air. I still think that this album is worth buying but if you like art-rock, then don't do yourself the injustice of giving yourself a lower impression of the Alan Parsons Project by buying this one first. I would rate this album high in APPs ouvre only for the best album cover and title in their catalog. This album saw the removal of the lush orchestrations that APP used in previous works and made the album more synth based to keep up with the 80s trend to used more keyboards. These changes marred what could've been a much better album.     Highlights:  Let's Talk About Me  Days Are Numbers (The Traveller)  Vulture Culture  Hawkeye  The Same Old Sun    Alan Parson's albums in order of preference    Eye In The Sky  The Turn Of A Friendly Card  Ammonia Avenue  Eve  I Robot  On Air  Time Machine  Pyramid     (Sorry folks, not a fan of Tales of Mystery and Imagination)    The remastering job on all APP albums is amongst the best I've ever heard. If you buy any of their albums get the Alan Parsons remasters.
0739319175|4.0|I am listening to the audio version of this book - simply because I am in the middle of reading another large book and I can listen to the book at work rather than music. I am perplexed at the 2 and 3 star ratings that this seems to be receiving. This is a highly entertaing book. Formulaic? Yes, a bit.Sort of so-so in parts? Yes, it is. When I read historical fiction I read it because I love it and because I make a game a game out of checking the historical facts to the novel. When I read a novel, such as \\"The Lost SYmbol\\" I read it strictly to be entertained -and I expect nothing more. An added bonus for me with this book is that it presents a lot of American History that is quite accurate. I can picture some of the places in the book from visits to Washington DC. If this was Dan Brown's first book rather than his second I wager people would up their star rating. There is nothing not to like about this book IMHO!<br /><br />PS: If you go for the audio version - the nnarrator is quite good too!

0385342020|5.0|You can call her work formulaic. You can claim her plots are contrived. But I challenge you to dispute the fact that Sophie Kinsella's stories are the most hilarious, laugh out loud yarns on bookstore shelves today.    In the past year I have twice been asked to laugh a bit more quietly in public venues where I was reading her books.    A master at setting up believably the most unbelievable situations, Kinsella writes easily and succinctly, deftly combining irreverence with compassion.    Twenties Girl tells the unlikely story of a young woman whose recently deceased great-aunt is unable to pass to the other side until a necklace she received from a former lover is located.  The twist is that the great-aunt Sadie's ghost appears as she was when she received the necklace:  a 1920s era flapper girl.      Kinella's protagonist Lara Lington is suspiciously similar in character to Becky Bloomwood of Shopoholic fame, as well as Emma Corrigan of Can You Keep a Secret? and Sam Sweeting, the Undomestic Goddess. But no matter: all these characters are funny, sweet and naïve, albeit in a sort of chronic liar-ish sort of way.    Lara and her great-aunt Sadie seem an unlikely pair at first, but Twenties Girl shows that family ties can sometimes cross the boundaries of age, class and in this case even mortality.    Kinsella's keen eye for the ridiculous details and the absurdity of the day-to-day human condition make this a deliciously uproarious read.    I am the author of [[ASIN:0741454688 Stuffed]], another darkly comic novel.
B00009RAJJ|3.0|This album came on the heels of FM's masterpiece, seminal album Rumours. It isn't a great album and should've been pared down from a double album to about 11 songs. These would've been my choice of songs for this album.     Think About Me  Sara  That's All For Everyone  What Makes You Think You're the One  Sisters Of The Moon  Angel  Brown Eyes  Storms  Honey Hi  Beautiful Child  Tusk    The problem is not a lack of good material, it is a lack of great material. Following Rumours we should expect much better from them, but it was an impossible act to follow and the free license that the success of Rumours gave the band was this album's undoing. Stevie Nicks saves the collection with her contributions even though Christine McVie and Lindsay Buckingham suffer from an obsession with mid-tempo filler that make listening to Tusk an encumbered task. Sara is the best song on the album and belongs on Rumours due to its lyrical content and high-quality musicianship.The song is a masterpiece in and of itself.     Lindsey Buckingham, this time around, seems to sacrifice soulful songwriting to play with production on his own songs and Christine McVie can only deliver ballads that, although nice, slow down the album too much. The album desperately needs 2 or 3 rockers with the intensity of Go Your Own Way, The Chain or Don't Stop. Instead we get a mediocre follow-up to one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Still, there are a few numbers that are worthy of the Fleetwood Mac label.   These are:     SARA  That's All For Everyone  SISTERS OF THE MOON  Angel  Brown Eyes  BEAUTIFUL CHILD  TUSK    Of those, the ones in uppercase are the only true classics.    The album is not a total loss, but it's hard to digest so much slower material interspersed with very few true standouts; definitely one for completists and fans of soft, ballad rock. It does get better with repeated listens but it never comes close to the greatness that were the 2 albums preceding it.     The remastering is as good as it gets as is the case for the remastering job on Rumours and the eponymous Fleetwood Mac album. I don't care much for outtakes, so I won't comment on the extra disc. It's probably of interest only to hardcore fans.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I loved this one!!Very entertaining and a few nice twists to the story.Anyone who loves Jane Austen books or movies will definately appreciate or maybe even relate to this.
B000NJVWUA|4.0|This was the last truly great offering from The Alan Parson's Project. This has 3 hits in Prime Time, Don't Answer Me and You Don't Believe. The album is a little bit mellower than their previous efforts, but it's still one of their best. To me it sounds like Eye In The Sky Part II. That album is even better than this one though. The production is identical and Prime Time sounds an awful lot like the hit Eye In The Sky.     Besides the hits, the album tracks are just as good and in some cases better. The only song that I don't especially like is Give Me One Good Reason which features an attempt at 80s electronica that doesn't quite work. Other than that, this is a great piece of art rock. Highlights include:    Prime Time  Don't Answer Me  Dancing On A Highwire  You Don't Believe  Pipeline  Ammonia Avenue    That's almost the entire album. Let Me Go Home is just not unique enough to be a highlight but is still a good rocker and Since The Last Goodbye is overshadowed by Don't Answer me as the love song entry into this album but is still worth a listen.     Alan Parson's albums in order of preference    Eye In The Sky  The Turn Of A Friendly Card  Ammonia Avenue  Eve  I Robot  On Air  Time Machine  Pyramid    Any of these are sure to please fans of art-rock. Alan Parsons made other albums that are surely loved by other fans, but these are the ones that I really enjoy and would recommend.     If you plan on buying this, make sure you get the definitive Alan Parson's remasters which are some of the best ever produced in terms of sound quality.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I really liked this version, of course what's not to like with Andrew Davies. The setting, costumes and actors were great!
B000NJVWU0|4.0|The Alan Parsons Project was a group known for making concept albums and this one was one of the clearest and best accomplished of them. It's not a fan favorite but I like it well. From the Hipgnosis cover of women wearing nets over their faces to hide sore and blemishes on their faces to the end of the cd, we see and hear a commentary from APP on women and relationships between men and women in general. The opening number, Lucifer, is an instrumental alluding to the moment between Adam and Eve in The Garden of Eden before they were cast out. The album then spirals through vitriol and negative songs about women until it starts turning around at midpoint and becomes more about relationships starting with the amazing Damned If I Do. That is one of APPs best songs ever btw and also a hit as well as a fan favorite. The album ends with If You Could Change Your Mind which was another hit. The vocals and arrangements are stellar as is usual with this band. The only problem with this album is the amount of poison and negativity that pours out in the lyrics. The other problem is that although the diversity of styles used serves the album's concept and the individual songs well, the album doesn't hold together well musically and sounds a little like songs by several bands rather than one cohesive work.     I still love this album though, and I find myself in a minority among fans. The reason that I love this album is that I'm a sucker for good concept albums, and the diverse musical styles are used to great effect to illustrate each of the individual song's lyrical points. Eric Woolfson is the band's chief songwriter and he does a great job in creating the album's concept with a quality batch of songs that are catchy and very well written. The production, manned by Alan Parsons, is also of highest quality. I'm sure that the bluntness of many of the songs lyrics are part of the problem with the cds popularity, but if you can get past that or if you can be open-minded enough tosee the perspective used, then the brilliance of the album comes through. I wouldn't rank it in the same league with The Dark Side Of The Moon as far as concept albums go, but it stands on its own very well.     Alan Parson's albums in order of preference:    Eye In The Sky  The Turn Of A Friendly Card  Ammonia Avenue  Eve  I Robot  On Air  Time Machine  Pyramid     The remastering job on all APP albums is amongst the best I've ever heard.

B000TFINY6|5.0|This is my favorite season of LOST. It never seems to get boring it's constantly moving and changing. First they're captured then they're freed with a twist involved. The first six episodes are a mini season ending with a cliffhanger that left you stew for three months breathless. This season had a lot of great twists and turns with the Hatch, Nikki and Paulo, Charlie finding his fate, and Desmond teleporting through time. Then the finale hit and by the way the finale is my favorite episode of the series. It left you breathless and keep you wondering and obsessing over the long hiatus just what that last scene meant and what it would lead to. In a way the series had no where to go but down.    The series in my mind has gone down after this season. The fourth season was still pretty good, but the fifth season was a mistake. They did however rectify it in the season 5 finale and it looks like season 6 the final season may rival this season for the best of the series. Anyway the third season is a must watch as you learn more about the others, the island, the man behind the curtain, and most importantly you delve deeper and with finer focus the lives and pasts of the survivors. This season like the previous two had a much different feel. It introduced so much information that is still prevalent in the final season. This season is the greatest 23 hours of television you will ever watch. The Blu Ray is crisp and clear and brings you closer to the island then you ever thought possible. If you're on the fence on whether you should buy this on Blu Ray or DVD do yourself a favor and pay the extra money the video quality and extra special features are well worth it. Rating 5/5
0385504225|5.0|this book has gotten so many mixed reviews. Ive read A&D and TDC and think this is the best of the three. The Lost Symbol is fast paced, clever, and suspenseful. The bad guy in this one is fiendish and extremely creepy. Nothing is too far over the top such as is in the ending of A&D (novel). I found this to be well worth the wait and extremely satisfying. Studying the various religious traditions for over 15 years and being a Freemason may be the reason why I am extremely biased in favor of this great adventure.

B0026IYJEM|3.0|Searched high and low trying to get the special packaging. A bungled mess with Barnes & Noble. Amazon was not carrying the special pkg. Then the sub-vendors began selling via Amazon. Happy day! The only reason a person would go through such a hunt to get the special packaging is to keep it for collecting. Hence, when I received my hard-sought pkg, it has a linear gouge on the front of the case. The ink isn't scrapped off, but the metal is screwed. Can't be bent back and the quality of collector's series is gone....yet I paid almost $60 for it....a lot higher than the cost when it was first released. I'm disappointed, but the DVDs still play.
0061122416|4.0|I had heard about this book for years and how life changing it was and how deep the philosphical implications to the book were.  After finally reading it, I wouldn't say it is \\"life changing\\" so much as \\"inspirational.\\"  If you are religious at all, whatever religion or denomination, you will find theory, philosphy, doctrine and practice from your beliefs in this book.  Perhaps that makes it easier to believe and recognize the many fragments of truth spread throughout this book.  All in all, the story is tender and motivational.  It's clearly a fable and the idea of finding your personal mission in life, or letting it slide right by you, is one that will strum any number of heartstrings.  I read nothing that I didn't already know, but the story is so simply and truthfully crafted, you can't deny its force.  It is one of the few fiction books I have read that actually made me want to highlight passages and make notes in the margin.  Again, not because anything was revelatory, but simply because some things deserve noting in order to give yourself a bit of self-examination.     The only real low points that I could see this book having for others is that it is a slow moving tale.  There is no fast paced action to keep you turning each page.  Also, perhaps because it was translated from Portuguese, occasionaly I found myself slightly hung up on the phrasing.  It may not be an issue for most and it was nothing that took away from the story, just something that occasionaly had me re-read a passage in order to make sure I had read it correctly the first time.      Overall, this is a book that is a fast and good read.  It's only \\"deep\\" in the fact that it does make you think about how you are spending your life and if you are on the right trail for yourself.  As far as \\"deep philosophy,\\" anyone who has any belief in a higher power won't be overwhelmed in any way.

B005721Y7Y|2.0|It's BOTH.  It's a well-scripted, contrived and slick piece of film propaganda that's acted out by talented actors.<br /><br />I really loath this movie, despite the fact that it is entertaining and won an Oscar.  I loath the fact that it is so manipulative.  I hate the fact that very talented people created a script that has such a depressing and hateful \\"moral\\" agenda. This movie is very Alinsky-ite to me.  It is cynical to the fifth power, and all its cynicism is directed towards breaking down our repect for the American middle-class nuclear family, as well as other institutions such as free-market businesses and the American military.  American Beauty almost drips with hatred at the white, suburban American family.  Everyone in the movie is selfish and pathetic, except of course, the neighborhood gay couple, who are charming, well-adjusted and happy!  Everything is so contrived and absolutely manipulative.  I can't see why people like it, honestly, unless they just remove their moral sense and totally give in to the movie-makers' agenda.<br /><br />I loath the fact that the protagonist's (Kevin Spacey) daughter seems to care so little about her father, near the end of the movie (more on that below), and loath even more the depiction of the toxic family that her boyfriend/neighbor has.  I hate the poisonous way that the American Job is depicted: either a cynical place that Spacey's character extorts for severance pay, or a depressing place where his wife chases a big Real Estate score and then has an affair with her boss.  Inexperienced and impressionable people who watch this movie may be dissuaded into working for the private sector, and instead seek out paper-pushing bureaucratic jobs in government, because of the toxic nature in which private business is portrayed.  (And NOW we see that private sector jobs are steadily shrinking -- and do YOU things getting better or worse?)  Young people may watch the poisonous and loveless families in this movie and not want to get married or form families (And NOW we see that nuclear families are steadily shrinking, with a tsunami of single-parent families dependent on the government -- and do YOU think things getting better or worse?)<br /><br />< Spoilers Below ><br /><br />The absolute worst part of the movie shows the pot-smoking neighbor boy being browbeaten and physically abused by his over-the-top ex-Colonel father.  The writers then make the Colonel, who warns his son against \\"going gay\\", out to have secret gay tendencies.  Let me tell you, I guarantee that men who have risen to Colonel in the Army or Marines are quality people and not this kind of pathetic, loveless, dead-end hypocrite depicted here.  I guarantee that the vast majority of families with fathers in the military are good families where their kids love their parents, and their Mom and Dad love each other.  NOT in this propaganda film!  And of course, the adults in the movie are slaves to their sex drives:  Spacey wants to bed his daughter's hot cheerleader friend, his wife has an affair with her boss, and the Colonel wants to act out his homosexual urges.  In the liberal world, sex is our God and we are just helpless pawns to it!<br /><br />There is one scene that I like in the movie where Spacey becomes an adult, but it's followed by a scene of utter loathsomeness.  The one good scene is where Spacey gets his big chance with his daughter's friend, he discovers that she's a virgin, and then he refuses to go through with her sexual molestation, and instead comforts her.  Then unfortunately, he is shot in the head (by whom I won't say).  After he is shot (in his own house), I hate it that the writers show his own daughter simply looking at him with cold amazement, with less emotion than she would have if a dog got killed.  Absolutely no love for her father is shown. No family bond or warmth.  (VERY unrealistic and loathsome. Think if your father got shot!)  Are American teens so much into themselves that they wouldn't even mourn the murder of their own father??? I don't think so, but the cynical writers of this film think so.  Utter cynicism and poisonous contempt of the basic building block of our society:  the American Nuclear Family.<br /><br />So in summary, American Beauty is an engaging yet loathsome piece of propaganda, in which its creators slickly pedal the tenents of their destructive, Alinskyite values:  a) the American Family is a loveless sham; b) all adults are slaves of their sex drives; c) the Military, and the values of discipline that the Military believes in, is to be trashed; and d) Free-Market private enterprise is a corrupt institution and likewise to be trashed.

B001GCUO16|3.0|i won't go into detail because i'm sure it had been covered.  i was there when wolverine first appeared in the hulk and fought both hulk and wendigo.  i am also familiar with the original x-men from the 60's and 70's.  and i was there when wolverine appeared in the first \\"new\\" x-men.  none of this is in the movie.  this is more along the line of batman begins, taking original characters and modifying them to fit in a new story of the hero's beginnings.  the movie as a comic book action movie stands on its own legs but there are problems i have with it knowing what i have previously learned reading about these characters in the comic books.  if professor xavier is/was in theory the most powerful mutant on earth why is his contribution so limiting?  they would have been better off leaving him out.  same goes with cyclops. his character seems to be an afterthought essentially serving as a means of continuity for the subsequent x-men movies. nonetheless, the movie is pretty entertaining.  hugh jackman owns the wolverine character.  its hard to imagine anyone playing him as well as he does.
0385504225|1.0|I was very excited when I saw that this book would be available for my Kindle.  I'd be able to download it as soon as it was released, and I wouldn't have to wait in line at a bookstore or wait several days for deliverly like all of the suckers without a Kindle.  That was the plan, but I learned my lesson.  I would have saved myself a lot of pain if I had waited for the reviews to pour in.    What does one expect from a Dan Brown book? An ominious conspiracy, a threat to end the world as we know it, a relentless villain, a search for a McGuffin that requires the decoding of obscure clues, and a convoluted plot that ties all of these elements together.  One doesn't expect good writing, but in The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, the books strengths were enough to overcome Mr. Brown's weak writing.    For the first few chapters, the Lost Symbol seemed as if it would be equally successful.  However, as the pages wore on, it became apparent that much was missing.  The conspiracy seemed more pathetic than ominous.  In view of what has been happening in Washington D.C. recently, the threat to end the world as we know it seemed like it would be met with a shrug rather than a look of horror.  And the villain, while certainly relentless, was driven only by irrational 'roid rage.    The biggest disappointment was the revelation of the McGuffin after all of the clues had been decoded.  Robert Langdon, the expert on symbols who is the book's primary protagonist, could have discovered it by simply checking into his hotel, thereby saving himself and the rest of us a lot of time and effort.    When you reach the climax of the book (which puts an exclamation point on the irrationality of the villain), you will notice that there are quite a few pages remaining.  Mr. Brown has managed to stuff those pages with religous apologetics and pseudo-scientific nonsense, and even masochists who were willing to read John Galt's monologue in Atlas Shrugged in it's entirety will not be able to bear the finale of The Lost Symbol.      The entire book is full of the stench of pseudo-science, and Robert Langdon was put into the role of skeptic.  In addition to the many incidents of idiotic decisions made by Langdon and the other protaganists throughout the book, Langdon has to be the most ineffective skeptic in the history of the world.  As the book's proponents of pseudo-science babble on, any reader will be virtually begging Langdon to ask the right question or raise the right objection, but there is no hope.  Langdon is the ultimate in gullability.    Everybody has read versions of the religious apologetics that appear at the end of the book hundreds of time.  But there is something new there.  The conclusion of the apologetics is different from normal, and it will certainly be confusing to many Christians where the arguments went off the track.  The characters were relieved at the end of the story - finally, there is hope in the world.  I was relieved as well as soon as I pressed the Delete button.

0143034901|5.0|If you love reading books that are as satisfying as eating a 5 star gourmet meal than this book is for you. I lent it to my 21 year old son and he thought it was one of the best books he's every read.  Once I started, I couldn't put it down.  A truly beautiful book.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|A quick note on the ranking: I hold 5-star ratings in reserve for the best of the best.  The previous Robert Langdon books I would rate at about 4 stars for being fun reads but nothing that would resemble a literary masterpiece.  I enjoyed this book significantly less than the other two, hence the two stars.<br /><br />'The Lost Symbol' is not a bad book.  While it would certainly rank it 3rd amongst the three Robert Langdon novels it is still an amusing read.  I forgive Brown for his weak writing style and I accept that he writes characters that are fairly two-dimensional with little personality outside of that which pertains explicitly to the story.  I accept that this novel was going to have the exact same story structure and characters as the previous two.  I accept that the relationships between people will be odd.  I accept that most chapters will end with a variation on his cheap cliffhanger \\"And then Robert couldn't believe what he saw!\\"  I accept all that. And yet, even with all those concessions, this one just left me flat.<br /><br />When it comes to the writing style I'm not entirely sure if I should be blaming Brown or his editor (or, potentially, his lack thereof-which I guess would be blaming him).  The style, while simple, could easily be smoothed out with an editor who was given some room to work.  What hurts his prose is repetition of words and phrases over and over and over and over-often on the same page.<br /><br />Sure, the story structure is an identical match to the first two with all the same types of characters and twists.  But here's the issue, this time is just doesn't work like it did before.  Here's why:<br /><br />1. Robert Langdon is officially a moron: He spends more time being lectured to and making wrong guesses than he does solving anything.  His inner monologue serves to deliver some interesting asides, but nothing that helps forward the plot.  I'm fairly certain he figured out absolutely nothing critical in the last third of the book.  He was completely marginalized.<br /><br />2. The science of Noetics, as used in this book, is a complete throwaway with no bearing on the plot: In A&D the science of matter and anti-matter played a significant role in the overall plot.  It's relation to the Big Bang and religion as well as its overall implementation throughout the story was essential.  Here, the Noetics pops up just enough to be annoying once you realize it serves no primary purpose.  Also, Noetics is barely a science.  Reading this book would make one think it's far more legitimate than it is.  I was fascinated several years ago when I first heard it mentioned.  Upon further research one finds that it is more wishful thinking than science and that it has very little actual research and support.  Closer looks at studies (the water that has been \\"loved\\" is a favorite) show gaping holes, inconsistencies, and a complete lack of scientific method.  While it may sound nice it just serves no purpose.<br /><br />3. The payoff just doesn't work: Maybe we're out of major historical secrets to reveal to the world because this one just fizzles out.  The build-up of this story often felt like it was stretching.  In the previous Robert Langdon novels he finds himself moving between a great many locations surrounded by symbols and puzzles.  Here, he spends his time in a handful of buildings, several of which play no role in solving anything but are simply places for him to rest or think.  I often found myself turning pages, not to see what happened next, but to see if ANYTHING happened next.  The reveals in the first two were very cool.  This one gets such hype and then comes the \\"Really?  That's it.  I just read 500 pages to find THAT out?  There's a few hours I'll never have back.\\" moment.<br /><br />I can say, unequivocally, that when the special edition with all the pictures is released I will absolutely not be purchasing it.  I just don't care to ever read this novel again.  I learned a few things about history and there were some interesting parts.  But overall it was just mediocre, and sometimes that's worse than being bad..  But overall it was just mediocre, and sometimes that's worse than being bad.
B001HN69AE|3.0|A good fantasy adventure movie. Based on the Japanese Manga \\"Dragonball\\", this is a cartoon brought to the big screen. OK, this review is based exclusively on the movie as I haven't seen nor read any of the original Manga mateials. I really enjoyed the story and this was well made. I specially enjoyed the character Chi-chi. The reason for giving a 3 is that the story was a bit simple and the build-up to the big closing scene was too easy; perhaps this is a side effect of using a manga as your basis. Yes, I will watch this movie again in the future and do recommend it. P.S. Nice to see Chow Yun Fat in the movie.
B000LPR9ZS|2.0|With the rise of Blu ray, one would think that for the Saw series, the best versions would be made available. Pity this is not the case. The Unrated Director's Cut of Saw III clocks in at 121 minutes. The blu ray gives us only the unrated version, at 113 minutes. Why? It joins the original Saw on blu ray, offered in an R rated form. Yet, parts 2,4,and 5 are the longest versions offered. Why would blu ray get the lesser versions of part 1 and 3? No idea. As for the picture and sound, well they are crisp, loud and all they should be. If you own the 121 minute version of Saw III on DVD, I would keep it at least until Lionsgate deems us worthy of it on Blu ray.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|To begin, rest assured: this is going to be mostly \\"sweet\\", but there is also \\"bitter\\". Latter concerns the way these remasters were marketed as two separate box sets and how they still didn't get it completely right.    I bought the remastered stereos as separate albums two weeks ago at an independently owned local store in town. I had my Beatlemania event on the 8th instead of 9/9/9 as the owners had decided favorably to start selling after they had put out the display the day before. The price was certainly right these first few days, $9.99 per single CD and for that you also received a limited edition print, i.e. if you bought at least two CDs. I purchased all albums but wasn't interested in getting the stereo box set because of the awkward way it looked in the pictures. Too big for my CD shelves, so than, what do you do with it?    The digipacks on first impression look nice and put together with appropriate reference to the gems that they contain. I appreciate the booklets with George Martin production notes and brief historic notes describing the circumstances of the recordings, all laced with nice glossy photos. As many have described on this site, I found the sound to be vastly improved over the earlier CDs and even over the old vinyls I still own. The bass and drums are now more prominent and the instruments and vocals are resolved with greater clarity so that you hear new things that were buried before. My favorite albums (White Album, Beatles for Sale, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper) fare especially well, to my relief and appreciation.    But not everything is perfect. Please Please Me, With The Beatles, and Rubber Soul have this wide channel separation which in the case of the first two is a setback from before. Revolver has this separation as well, but I find this problematic only for Eleanor Rigby. By this time the Beatles had started to experiment with psychedelic sounds which are fun to hear coming from the different channels. For an improved version of Eleanor Rigby, one need only listen to the remixed version on the 1999 Yellow Submarine to see what can be done. I have appreciated the technical explanations of this separation effect in other reviews, with the one by Perlman striking me as especially informative and balanced in these early days. Frankly, I had never considered that mono would the solution to this problem, but I understand now that these monos have been coveted for a long time by devoted fans and audiophiles, for the many reasons cited in their reviews. However, the fact that these may be retained only in the form of an expensive second box set forms a practical obstacle and also an obstacle of principle. Why should I go out and buy a second box to hear things as they \\"were meant to be\\" and that would take me back to mono? This leads into the \\"bitter\\": If it was known upfront that the remastered stereos of especially PPM, WTB, and RS would not be fully satisfactory, why did Apple not dig in and do a limited form of remixing so that at least the vocals would be centered? And if they did not want to do that, why not include the mono versions on the same CDs as the stereos or, if they have to make the extra buck, why not make the mono versions available separately? This is not a new problem. The producers knew upfront that it wouldn't be right.    [Going back to \\"sweet\\" for the aftermath and conclusion] Inspired by the many testimonials and reviews on this site I decided that I wanted to hear for myself the difference between the stereo and mono. At this point I remembered that just a few years ago the Capitol albums had been reissued (for the first time on CD) with remastered stereo and mono versions on the same CD. To the purists these Capitols are heresy and as someone who grew up in Europe I had had little interest in these jumbled US versions of what I thought should have been simply the same as the UK albums. A used copy of the first box set showed up at the right time in a local store and I bit thebullet.    And what a tasty bullet that turned out to be! I have at last found versions of the early songs and albums that relate the excitement of what was The Beatles in 1964/65, and also learned a bit of what was done to improve the sound and make the albums more marketable. A historic note in this regard: these are the albums that swayed US teenagers and helped make the Beatles the worldwide phenomenon that we know them to be. For the music collector that I admit I am, this adds interest over just a second copy in mono of the same albums I had just repurchased in stereo.    First a few words about the way the US albums were put together. With The Beatles is divided over two US albums, Meet The Beatles and Beatles Second Album, the first focusing on Lennon and McCarthy compositions and the second on covers of American Rock & Roll, with added songs (mostly B-sides of singles) that have later become issued on the Past Masters, and in the case of Second Album, finishing up with the smash hit She Loves You. The excitement on this Second Album in particular is palpable: the R&R just keeps coming and you can just imagine how this album would have had heavy rotation at parties across the US with everyone dancing and having fun nonstop. I make a point of this because the UK albums do not convey this excitement in quite the same way. You have the more \\"serious\\" numbers intermixed with the fast that reveal the Beatles as more all-round, but that break up the flow. This \\"butchering\\" of song content and order was done without input from the Fabs, but the Capitol producers apparently knew what they were doing and how best to reach the public. Other examples that jump out at me are the reordering of songs from Please Please Me on the US album Early Beatles (placing Twist and Shout in the second slot instead of Misery; Early Beatles is part of the second Capitol box which I purchased soon after digesting the first) and the song selection on Beatles '65. Most of these songs arefrom Beatles for Sale, but they picked the best ones, added a few songs here and there from Help and especially the great single I Feel Fine with its B-side She's A Woman. How is that for a lineup? Looking back, the Beatles and Brian Epstein maintained the policy of not including singles of the time on their UK albums. While these singles have become fully available on various greatest hits collections and the Past Masters CDs, this hurt the original albums--at least that is my view after hearing the US albums.    But what about the sound and this \\"horrible\\" reverb that was added? First off, the amount of echo is not out of the ordinary compared to other recordings of the time. Listen for example to the Chess recordings of Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Sonny Boy and all those other greats, or the Sinatra Capitols, or indeed many jazz recordings of the time. It's nothing that you go \\"Argh, what the heck is that?\\" What I found, however, is that the extra touch of reverb makes the stereo recordings sound fuller and more centered. And since these albums were remastered right, they have punchy bass and are great in the treble (e.g the cymbals). You can hear how this works by changing the balance on the stereo player: While on the new remasters you can hardly make out the vocals on the left channel, on the Capitols you hear part of the echo and as soon as you add more of the right channel, the vocals become centered till they move to the right with the balance centered. The mono versions of these early albums also sound good (they have less reverb), but lack the detail that you get in stereo. So that is a pleasant surprise.    The only album that I am now not fully happy with is Rubber Soul. The stereo Capitol version suffers from a similar channel separation as the new remasters. For that reason I prefer the mono version, but that is mono while I know from the other albums (including the new remasters of A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale) how good the stereo soundswith more centralized vocals. Also, there are four songs missing on the US version of RS. On the other hand, the odd Help soundtrack sounds very good and I find it soundwise more powerful than the new remaster. This album of course has the goofy pieces of instrumental film music intermixed with the songs which I find periodically entertaining (especially the sitar laced Another Hard Day's Night). However, it is not like the UK Help with just the Beatles songs and I could see that this might not appeal to everyone. With this in mind and after all this exploration, I think Apple should have done a better job with the stereo versions of Rubber Soul and also Please Please Me, With The Beatles, and Help. The fact that they didn't qualifies as a missed opportunity.    To conclude: my recommendation for young music lovers with an adventurous spirit who want to get into the Beatles but are wondering what to do after all the conflicting reviews. With ears trained by modern recordings, I expect that you will like the stereo remasters best, in general. (I certainly do). The route that I would recommend is that you replace Please Please Me, With The Beatles, Beatles for Sale (although that hurts because the new remaster sounds very nice), Rubber Soul, and maybe Help with the Capitol boxes. That gets you covered also with the first CD of Past Masters, with loss of only a few songs. For example you will miss \\"Misery\\" from Please Please Me, but believe me, you'll live without it. Rubber Soul remains a problem: you miss four songs if you go the Capitol route. But who knows, maybe another reissue will appear in the future, maybe the mono disc that is now part of the box set or at last, a properly remixed version. You then go on with the stereo remasters: A Hard Day's Night, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, etc. I am somewhat curious about the mono versions of Sgt. Pepper and the White Album, but because the \\"psychedelic\\" stereo effects make up such a great part of the listening experience, I can just not see myself trading that joy for the \\"extra punch\\" or whatever else has been mentioned for the monos. That is of course a personal take on things. Completing the list, you might get by with only the second Past Masters CD issued in the late 1980's. Actually that second disc sounded pretty good and I would probably start out with a used copy of that instead of the new two-CD set. The total cost of this combination might be somewhat higher than the full stereo remaster set, but not by much depending what price you can find the Capitols for. For that you get excellent sound and you get to sample the excitement of the early days better than in any other form available. And you do have mono versions of the early albums and Rubber Soul as well.    [September 23, 2009] PS: Correction to minor misstatement in the heat of the argument. Two songs from the UK Help were added to the US Rubber Soul, not to Beatles '65. To the latter the last song of A Hard Day's Night (I'll Be Back) was added in addition to I Feel Fine, etc. The Chess recordings that I mentioned are in mono and sound very good. The first Sinatra Capitols were in mono too, but from about 1957 they went stereo. It is as if a light came on. Some of his early 60's recordings feature ping-pong stereo, but they were nevertheless grounded by having the vocals in the center.

B002FOQXZK|5.0|I originally purchased this album not really expecting much. I really liked 'Day N Nite' but was not huge on Cudi's rapping abilities and feared Consequence-esque mediocrity. Far from it, I can not take this album off heavy rotation. I've seriously been listening to it non-stop since I got it, and the way the album flows together is awesome. From someone who has just about every major hip-hop album from this year, Cudi stands head and shoulders over everything else. Granted, this isn't just a straight rap album by usual standards, but it is full of great music. If you have any appreciation for hip-hop, you should not hesitate to buy this album.
0790731940|5.0|Rounders is the only better movie out there about No Limit Texas Holdem and this movie was made earlier.  Probably a bit of inspiration to the makers of Rounders as this movie was a bit more comedy than actual reflection on the game of Poker.    Richard Donner and Mel Gibson are a team made in heaven.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Yet another Jane Austen movie?  You could say that this stinker is an Austen-INSPIRED movie.  But any inspiration was all on Miss Austen's side.  Any movie adaptation must take some artistic license even with a literary classic, but this dreadful production takes too many unforgiveable liberties.  This is for the crowd that reads Austen and thinks, \\"Great story, but where's the sex?\\"<br /><br />The movie goes off course in very basic ways--plot, theme, characters and setting.  The principal characters are prominent people of means.  Why do they all look as though they need a hairbrush and a bath?  Mr. Bennet is a solitary bookworm with an acerbic wit.  How did he become become a disheveled hick?  Miss Austen writes that Elizabeth had a lively air of sportive playfulness that made it difficult for her to offend anybody.  So why are we treated to so many views of Keira Knightley's bared, vampiric teeth as she bites off her sadly abridged lines?  Matthew Fayden is an equally unsatisfactory Darcy, so far removed from the handsome, elegant, arrogance of the original that we keep waiting for the hero to show up and get the story going.  Lady Catherine is all sweaty vitriol, too vituperative to be as ridiculous as she should be.<br /><br />The change of setting to the Georgian period is a poor fit, as is the barnyard the Bennets appear to occupy.  Mr. Bennet is a gentleman, not a gentleman farmer.  The Elizabeth-Darcy romance is better attuned to the early age of romanticism, particularly in the relationship of the characters to nature.  Austen heroines like to be outdoors, and many pivotal scenes take place in a garden.  This aspect was far better treated in the films \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" and the BBC's Austen productions, which are more appropriately set in the Regency period.<br /><br />Worst of all is that final scene!  Like so many dimwitted authors who spin off Austen's novels into hot steaming garbage, someone tacked a jarring final scene onto this film that feels all the more coarse for bringing such an elegant tale to a tasteless conclusion.  Not that all the scenes that precede it are much better; but they merely distort the story.  Its clumsy ending hammers it into a cynical, profit-seeking uber-anachronism.the more coarse for bringing such an elegant tale to a tasteless conclusion.

B002I9Z8G2|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie itself as it's clearly been out long enough I'm just going to give a quick review for those curious as to the bluray transfer. I picked up the disc yesterday and watched it last night. The quality of this bluray disc is stunning! The clarity is top quality and the color vibrance is amazing, without looking fake or hyped. I didn't notice any unusual artifacts like edge enhancement nor any noise reduction - I watched it on my 52\\" Samsung LCD but didn't get right up at the screen to examine for these things. But from where I was sitting it looked flawless. The sound is also fanstic and what I noticed the most is that the movie doesn't suffer from the irritating dramatic volume changes. Yes, during action scenes things get louder as they normally should but it wasn't so much that I had to ride the volume control, which is hugely irritating and becoming more common in today's new releases. If you still don't get what I mean I'm referring to the dialog being much lower in volume to the tremendously loud action scenes. Anyhow, this disc doesn't suffer from that, yet there is still a good amount of bass to put you into the feel of the action scenes.    I highly recommend this disc!    *EDIT - forgot to mention there are several extras listed on the back of the box and all of them are listed as being in HD as well. Being that I don't have the case in front of me though I can't list the extra's titles.
0385504225|1.0|The Lost Symbol is exciting, well-plotted and well-written... until the last 50 pages, which are an apologia about how we should read and believe the Bible. Blech.

B002M9FWQE|4.0|'The Boy Who Knew Too Much' is Mika's second studio album. If you are wondering how this compares to his first release, this collection of songs is still very pop orientated with Mika's signature use of piano and drums and organic, free-style singing approaching. 'The Boy Who Knew Too Much' is very light; somehow Mika manages to make most of the songs very upbeat and optimistic with the exception of one or two. The production and writing quality of the lyrics are slightly improved over his debut album and on some songs, the instrumentals are remarkably well (at times more so than the lyrics).<br /><br />The Good: Mika has improved as a song writer and producer. I was impressed more so with some of the musical instrument production more so than the lyrics simply because some of the songs are very complex and moving musically while the lyrics were a bit lacking and not as strong. Also, Mika did not stray too far from the style of his first release. In many ways this feels like a natural progression from the first album rather than something completely new and different. More tracks featured on this release came together better for me and felt more cohesive than in the previous release. Only up until the last two or three tracks did I feel he was going too far out into weird musical territory.<br /><br />The Bad: None of the tracks are bad, but some felt weak. Mika shines on the upbeat, pure celebratory 'pop' tracks like \\"We Are Golden\\", \\"Blame It On the Girls\\" and \\"Good Gone Girl\\", while the slower tracks felt somewhat out of place with the rest of the album's vibe. While \\"Toy Boy\\" is quirky and tells a (somewhat) amusing story lyrically, it simply brings the album down because it feels very left field and distracting, taking away from the smooth flow of the album. \\"Dr. John\\" sounded like a cut from his first album, and that was okay but to me as a listener, it felt out of place among the other tracks.<br /><br />In all, if you liked Mika's first release, you'll enjoy this one. It's pop, fun, dance-inducing with interesting lyrics and musical backing that really pulls you into the experience. There is a very old, Beatles/Queen vibe on a lot of tracks while some felt like they were re-imaginings of older songs (\\"Touches You\\" reminds me a lot of a pop-remaking of George Michael's \\"Father Figure\\"; \\"Good Girl Gone\\" features some harmonies similar to Frankie Valli's \\"Walk Like a Man\\"). Mika flirts with different past genres of music; a little hint of disco with a lot of 1980s woven through many tracks. It's fun, carefree, quality music. Only a few tracks are skip-worthy but otherwise it's a solid effort. Worth a listen.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Blame It On the Girls\\", \\"Touches You\\", \\"One Foot Boy\\", \\"Rain\\"un, dance-inducing with interesting lyrics and musical backing that really pulls you into the experience.

0439023491|4.0|After their historic joint win in the annual Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have returned to District 12, bringing the fruits of their victory with them. When sinister President Snow comes to visit Katniss, though, she realizes that the consequences of her defiance of the government in the Games may be larger than she thought. And Katniss has personal problems as well; the fictional love affair with Peeta which led directly to their victory is causing her difficulty with Gale, her childhood friend and now romantic interest, but the president insists that she continue to carry out the charade with Peeta. On their Victory Tour, Peeta and Katniss encounter unrest in the Districts, where they are seen as heroes...and inspirations for rebellion.<br /><br />As in the first book, I love brave, impulsive, tough Katniss and was pleased to see her relationships with both Gale and Peeta developing. As far as the plot goes, on the one hand, I thought the way in which Collins used the Hunger Games again was pretty clever, without doing a straight repeat of the first book's games. On the other, though, I would have liked to see more of what's behind the Games, of the actual political scene. The book suffers a little from middle-book syndrome; there's not quite enough development of the overall plot arc to satisfy entirely. I think I will have to withhold judgment on this until the third book of the trilogy is out, to see whether Collins can transcend the setting of the first two books and make the world she's created more complex. The revelations at the end of _Catching Fire_ certainly make me hopeful that she's about to do this. And I should say: it ends on quite a cliffhanger, making me especially eager for the last book.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I rented this movie off of netflix and loved it so much I ended up buying it from Amazon almost immediately after watching it! The characters are great! They are awkward, shy, unsure, confused, and just NORMAL! It really reminded me of what it's like to grow up in a small town. The movies had many funny moments, and some sad moments. I just absolutely fell in love with it.
0385504225|3.0|Although I enjoyed The Lost Symbol, it was no Da Vinci Code.  Although it tried.  Dan took the Da Vinci Code and moved it to Washington DC.  It was interesting learning some of the meaning behind the architecture in DC, just as it was interesting to muse over Rome and Paris in Da Vinci.  Beyond that, I thought the storyline tried to follow the script a bit too much.  This time, the characters and the events were too cliched.  There was the woman who sounded like a man, evil people, \\"seeing\\" with hands and just a lot of people taking themselves overseriously.  If you read one book a year, I wouldn't make this it.  However, if you're a serious reader and a DB fan, you should get it and enjoy some reminiscing and connecting the dots to DVC.
0452295548|4.0|The best part of this book is the author's first-person account of what it feels like to have a massive hemorrhagic stroke in your left hemisphere, rendering her speechless, languageless, movement impaired, frightened and totally dependent.  The irony is that up until that time, the 37-year old author was a noted researcher and speaker on, of all things, neurology.<br /><br />Following the stroke Taylor embarked on a marathon 8-year long struggle to regain her language, relearn her movement, recover her strength and to some extent return to her old career.  Yet the process of re-learning every little thing also gave her the opportunity to re-evaluate everything she used to do and be, and she made some conscious choices along the way to try to become a better person the second time around.  She claims to be more patient, more compassionate and more \\"stop-and-smell-the-roses\\" than she used to be.<br /><br />All this is fine and makes a good story.  If she'd have left it at that the book would have earned an easy five stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately the last third of the book expands on the now mostly-discredited left-brain/right-brain functional dichotomy, and very repetitively goes over and over how the author feels about peacefulness and meditation and prayer and deep breathing exercises and something she calls \\"Angel Cards.\\"  It's all a bunch of New Age crap that damages the credibility of the mostly scientific and mostly sober first two thirds.
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|Note the title its not a review I saw the movie in the theater & purchase the dvd. I am 53 and grew up reading comics (Marvel & DC)when it was 12 cents (!) the negative reviews are mostly complaining the film does not follow the comic book well it can't how can you use the comic book story line where Wolverine survives a nuclear blast - what works in comics but do not work in films. Just look at Dark Knight, Iron Man etc where the film make subtle changes. This is true in all book to film translations go read the Godfather and compare it to the film there are many ideas that do not translate well to film. The film writers & director do their best to keep the integrity of the character in tact where everyone can enjoy not just for the comic book die-hards. So please enjoy Wolverine & the other comic book films.
0385504225|2.0|Like so many others, I swallowed all that raving pre-release hype and bought this book,a makeover of the Da Vinci Code with even more cardboard characters. The author does everything except say \\"Wow! look what the next surprise is\\". Unfortunately, the next \\"surprise\\" becomes more and more boring if not implausible. The \\"plot twists\\" are absurd to say the least and the recuperative powers of some of these folks is itself worthy of scientific study. I forced myself to finish this novel but it wasn't easy. It DOES have one redeeming feature though: I know now not to waste even more money to see the movie.    Btw...I would have rated it ONE star instead of two but I don't HATE any book. Amazon might consider describing a one star rating as \\"total disappointment\\" which, in my opinion, describes this book perfectly .
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol has been all hyped up for months even years but once the hype dies down get ready to enjoy one of the best reads of the year. In Dan's third adventure for Professor Langdon we find ourselves in Washington DC where the good professor is on a flight for his life through the sub-basement of  the Capitol to some very esteemed Washington addresses to the top of the Washington Monument all the while on a fight to save the life of a friend.<br /> Dan gives us some great new adversaries and supporters with his characters whom he is intimately acquainted with make the novel exciting and impossible to put down. The plot is original and like that other lesser know novel that he wrote is full of ciphers, codes, science and great mysteries, he draws the reader into his story by filling it full of fact along with the fiction. He gives Professor Langdon another shot at romance with the enigmatic Dr. Katherine Solomon, does it succeed, well you'll just have to read it to find out. His dialogue is fast paced and exhilarating and takes the reader at top speed through these 509 pages of nail biting, heart thumping excitement.<br /> Mr. Brown does not disappoint with The Lost Symbol, he gives his fan's just what they've been waiting for so long. So to all the so called \\"experts\\" who have pooh-poohed this novel even before publication I say you must not have read the same novel as I did. But find out for yourselves, don't let \\"them\\" tell you what to read and what to like. Read the book and I promise you won't be disappointed.

0515142247|5.0|I discovered Lee Child in 2008 and have already exhausted his printed work, reading most of the Reacher series backwards. Die Trying is in my opinion at least in the top three of the series. The stuck-in-the-cave scene was too much. Like all of the Reachers it was full of ridiculous coincidence to start (Reacher just happening to be there when the daughter of the Joint Chiefs head is abducted) but we can easily forgive this extravagance in order to get Reacher into a situation that will provide the opportunity to see just what he can do. Don't plan on taking too long to read it - it just can't be done.
0385504225|5.0|It's fiction people...it's supposed to be far fetched. But what it's really supposed to do is make you open up your mind and think. The DaVinci Code was a hit, and it had it's underlying religiousity, so what is it that is pushing people to rate this book so badly? Nothing but the idea that religion is not what everyone has been taught that it is. *gasp*  Open your minds people. See what is in front of you and what is NOT in front of you to see. Does this not seriously make people question what they thought they knew? That's the point behind his works. To make you really sit back and wonder if what he writes could be possible. It's called expanding your intellect. As for all the info about the Masons, the conspiracy theories drummed up through the ages are exactly what Brown calls them to be. The Masons have been an easy target because of their policies regarding handling situations that place them hand in hand with what are supposed to be the countries greatest conspiracy plots. This is FICTION. Read it with an open mind. Noetics is actually a practiced science, the Masons really aren't horrible people planning on taking over the world, and this book should make you take stock in your surroundings and the things you thought you knew. Read it for what it is, and enjoy it. He's an author with a serious talent, and there aren't a ton of those anymore....

0743537009|5.0|The voice acting in this book is pretty good. Not great but still pretty good. All the characters had different voices, and when Jack Torrance gets angry the narrator really gives a great performance. I would say the production quality of this story was very good.    Now the story is great, it's about a haunted hotel. A hotel with a very shady past and the ghosts seem to stick around. The hotel only really comes alive in the winter, on the anniversary of an old party that occurred many years ago that replays every year it seems. So during the summer months when this Colorado hotel is open everything seems normal, but when the hotel closes down for the winter that's when the hotel starts to get restless.    In comes Jack Torrance and his family, and Jack really needs a job after getting fired from his teaching job after he got angry with a student. So the family moves to Colorado and the Overlook Hotel for the winter because of the money, and during this time Jack plans on finishing writing a play. Because of Jack's past anger problems he's a ripe vessel for the hotel to prey on.    And what the Hotel wants is his son, Danny. Danny has The Shining, a special ability that allows him to read thoughts of others and even speak to others who have the shining. And because of this power the hotel wants to absorb it and gain more power.    This is one of King's better stories, and it ends well, which can sometimes be a problem with King. This is an easily recommended story by King in fact it's one of the books to recommend for a new reader to King. And lastly, the book is way different than the Stanley Kubrick movie, so don't presume that you know what's happening because you watched that movie - you don't.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|The CD is fine (though many of his seem to offer the same material) - but the DVD of his \\"early famous\\" interviews and performance add a great deal to appreciating the man and his interest in this type of music, family, art.  It's a similar approach to the later Madison Square Garden CD/DVD, and gives the \\"first look\\" to compare to that later refined, developed, and confident performer.

I've read at least 100 Star Wars books, and a great many of the games. I realize there is a lot of crap under the banner of Star Wars. But... this series is a horrendous abomination.<br /><br />The dialogue is beyond horrendous, and makes the most awkward \\"love\\" scenes in Episode II feel like the work of Shakespeare by comparison. It's worse even than typical children's' shows in that while it's obviously aimed for children, it's still unbelievably terrible, and so full of stupid puns and tired expressions and dull monotonous recitation of lines that I imagine even the target audience would be bored with these sequences, and fast forward through all but the battle scenes.<br /><br />Jar Jar Binks is rendered pleasant in comparison to this Padawan girl that Anakin is inexplicably given to train (Jedi Knights do not train Padawans; only Masters) whose entire role consists of generic \\"tough girl\\" sassy quips and ridicule.<br /><br />The 3D animation is what you'd expect from a LucasFilms budget, but perhaps to keep themselves linked with the much more successful Clone Wars micro-sodes by Genndy Tartakovsky, they retain the stupid shapes of people's heads that consists of various juxtapositions of gravity-defying squares, circles, and polygons. Count Dooku's beard looks like the triangular front-piece of an old-time freight train, and it looks stiff as metal, too.<br /><br />The battle scenes would certainly be the highest appeal for children, but for the non-children watcher, even those are usually made a mess by the constant stale quips and jabbering between Obi-Wan and Anakin and That Annoying Girl being spoken/yelled at one another throughout an entire sequence.<br /><br />General Grievous is just as useless and nonthreatening a villain as he was in the movie, and the droid shenanigans that are apparently meant to be \\"humorous\\" are jacked up tenfold from the movie, and ten times less cute/funny.<br /><br />Obviously the point of this series is to make an open-ended source of stories, no matter how stale or hackily written, to be exploited for episode fodder and money.y meant to be \\"humorous\\" are jacked up tenfold from the movie, and ten times less cute/funny.<br /><br />Obviously the point of this series is to make an open-ended source of stories, no matter how stale or hackily written, to be exploited for episode fodder and money.

I put her ahead of Madonna, Michael Jackson, Celine Dion, EVERYONE, and this album only gives me more proof that she deserves it.    Every song is a true gem, from the gorgeous \\"Amarte Es Todo\\" to the desperation cry of lost time in \\"Apresurate\\". I don't skip over a single song.  \\"Por Arriesgarnos\\" took me by surprise, very slowly but surley, it has become my favorite song of the album.    \\"Tu\\" is a masterpiece unto itself.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Greetings,    I don't want to dissuade or promote. I wish to offer an idea. I have listened to The Beatles through every stage of their existence. I grew up on the stereo capitol albums.    If you are worried about purchasing the mono set due to familiarity issues, remember that the stereo cds are available forever. The mini documentaries aren't all that. The mono mixes are finite.    I purchased the mono box for two reasons.    1. They are the only true remasters where there is a measurable difference between what I grew up with and what is available now.    2. I would like to be rewarded for the money I spend with something more than a better copy of what I bought before.    That said, I love the added bass and presence of the few stereo remasters that I have purchased. I agree with others that a combination of the two is best.    If you can't buy both, buy the mono set and augment it with the stereo cds that you might be nostalgic for.      Jeff Bothwell  Anaheim CA.              [[ASIN:B002BSHXJA The Beatles Mono Box Set]]
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Constantine is a great movie.  It is based on the comic book series Hellblazer, and is about a Con-man/Magician.  In the movie, Constantine played by Keanu Reeves, is hired to investigate a suicide, that leads him into the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell.  It is a solid movie, one of my favorite Comic book to movie adaptation.  The Visual effects are intense, and the story keeps you interested.  If you have never read the comic, the movie does a good job on its own.  A suggestion would be to pick up the comic and read it before you watch this movie, so it is more enjoyable.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is a short 7-episode series aired by (surprisingly) American Movie Classics.  While a team effort, this series was created by Vince Gilligan and stars Bryan Cranston (the dear not-so-old dad from \\"Malcom in the Middle\\") as the desperate, cancer-ridden chemistry teacher, Walter White.    The pilot episode gives us what appears to be a basic plot - a good guy, White, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  Strapped with poor insurance and a teacher's salary, he turns to a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to sell drugs to pay for his treatment.  So far, if this sounds like a retread of Michael Douglas's character in \\"Falling Down,\\" you wouldn't be far off.    But then it turns out that Walter is more than meets the eye.  Sure, his family doesn't really respect him - his brother-in-law is a DEA agent and is shocked to hear that wallflower Walt would even consider smoking a joint.  It turns out that Walter is a genius when it comes to chemistry, and his sidekick Jesse is shocked to discover that in one afternoon Walter cranks out crystal meth of such purity as the local market has never seen before. Indeed, the DEA discovers a sample of the product and is convinced that a new drug kingpin has arrived in town.    All of this is told in gradual steps - we see brief flashbacks of Walter at CalTech lecturing to a beautiful grad student while simultaneously seducing her, only to later learn that she is married to Walter's former best friend and classmate who has made millions patenting chemicals that he and Walter worked on together.   Exactly why Walter is teaching indifferent high school students when he is so gifted is never explained, but thanks to Cranston's steller performance and some wonderful writing we see that Walter is a proud, conflicted, flawed man who has made some hard choices but never blames anyone for his failures.    And his failures are many.  Walter is the only guy left in America driving a Pontiac Aztec, for pete's sake!  His marriage has fallen into tedium, and his wife tries to squeak a few pennies out of selling junk on EBay.  Walter is not really close to anyone, and did I forget to mention the terminal lung cancer?    Watching Walter emerge from his stifled teacher existence as he fights to raise the heaping gobs of money for his cancer treatment while keeping his wife in the dark is a pure joy.  Liberated by his terminal status, Walter has never been more alive.    This is an excellent series, if a bit short at 7 episodes.  Here's looking forward to Season 2.  Also, even though this is a product of \\"basic cable\\" on AMC, there is a spot of nudity and some rather prolific swearing, so don't be fooled into thinking this is something that has been sanitized for network TV - this is hard-core stuff.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Well it took over 4 years to get it right, but it was worth it! This beautiful box is an A plus in most every aspect, from the gorgeous box to the cd packaging to the liner notes to the awesome rare photos all the way to the astounding vastly improved music. The Beatles never sounded better! Yeah, you gotta really listen in spots to certain songs to hear a difference, but most are clearly audible. The only negative i would have would be that the cd's should be easier to remove from their booklets than they are. You have to careful taking them out, and some do not want to budge.    One more thing, all the one and two star reviewers need to get a life. You all claim to be so-called \\"beatles purists\\" and \\"sound engineers\\" who have nothing better to do than to boast your al-mighty \\"know it all\\" recording techniques by slamming this set as so much inferior to the mono box. Well you can have your mono and I'll keep my stereo. I'm not on here slamming your mono. I bet most of you \\"mono purists\\" do not even own this stereo box, you just wanna bitch. I say stay on your mono site and bitch all you want.    Remember, \\"the love you take is equal to the love you make\\"!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|I read about Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog on another website called Cake Wrecks. When I searched for it, I was so excited to see that Amazon had copies for sale. When my fiance and I watched it, it made us laugh so hard we cried. It is fairly short which is nice. The songs stay with you for days - the cast did an excellent job. I would recommend that you check this one out!
B002M9FWQE|5.0|i fell in love with mika and his music when i first heard \\"grace kelly.\\" loved his first album, life in cartoon motion (especially the song \\"love today\\"). i know that when an artist comes out with a smashing debut their second effort tends to pale in comparison. the new cd is basically the same sound and feel as mika's first cd.  i love the sound and feel of the first cd...so i do like the sound/feel of the new cd. if you like cartoon you will like the boy (if you didn't like cartoon,you will not like the boy). i love his sound, but i was not expecting a duplicate cd. the songs on each cd can be traded with the songs of the other. it is a good cd. my favorite songs are: we are golden, touches you and one foot boy. i give the cd 5 stars because it is a good cd, it is fun music and mika is a great singer.
1416594787|5.0|I've enjoyed reading, and have learned from, all of Richard Dawkins' books. He's an excellent writer, and a recognized expert in his field. This book is no exception. It delivers a slam-dunk critique of creationism and \\"Intelligent Design\\" and proves its case that EVOLUTION IS A FACT! Period. Get over it. It is sad that a book like this has to be written, but that is the unfortunate reality of the situation. If it were up to me, this book would be required reading for every high school student in the US.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones sound great.  They are very comfortable and reliable.<br />It's no surprise these are the standard headphones in music industry.
B000WTDGD2|4.0|I watched this as a promo, so I didn't spend money on it, I probably wouldn't spend money on something like this in the future either, but it's a good show.
0385504225|4.0|Finished the book in two days. The beginning is somewhat slow, and you get the feeling the author is 'showing off' with esoteric definitions in the middle.    Wonderful finish, and by finish I mean the last 1/3 of the book.    Worth reading, especially if you're a fan of the genre.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|I feel like everyone is getting the joke but me... the music sounds the same.    I was motivated to get an amp to use with my new Sennheiser PC 350 headset because it was suggested that their 150 Ohm load would be difficult to drive, and that audio quality would improve with such an amp.    However, now that I have an E5, I can't really hear any difference in sound quality with it hooked in.  At max volume on the E5 it's maybe two or three \\"Ipod shuffle clicks\\" louder than without it.    But to my ears the music sounds the same.    (tested with an E5, Ipod shuffle, on-board PC sound card, and various high sample rate mp3 files)
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Dysfunctional family + road trip = Hollywood gold<br /><br />In all seriousness, this independent film surprised many. It's offbeat, and boasts excellent performances by the entire cast.
B0000TB014|4.0|I love this DVD, best selection of Michael's videos. Smooth Criminal is fast and blurry, but overall this is my favorite selection of videos!
0385504225|1.0|There are not enough words to say how angry this book made me, especially the ending.  After 400 pages of moderately entertaining, boilerplate, Dan Brown thriller, I was served an ending that is so disappointing it will forever be the ending against which I judge all bad endings.  I felt cheated.  I was disappointed and upset.  But most of all, I was angry.  Angry at Dan Brown for writing it, angry at his publisher for publishing it, and most of all, angry at myself for wasting a beautiful fall evening setting myself up to get disappointed by it.  Spare yourself.  Life is too short.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Overall, Iron Man is the best two-disc package available on Blu-ray. The film is fun, the audio is mighty impressive and I can't in good conscience fault the video quality enough to deduct points. It may not be the most detailed picture I've ever seen, but I believe that could easily be accounted for by the camera work and CGI integration. Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films. There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes; enough humor to keep any audience laughing; enough character development to satisfy the critics and stark nerds; and enough effects and action to get the adrenalin rush thru our bodies. Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu-ray.    Now this is what you get for the BD version:    Blu-ray Disc 1:    Hall of Armor   The Invincible Iron Man Origins  Friends & Foes  The Definitive Iron Man  Demon in a Bottle  Extremis and Beyond  Ultimate Iron Man  Deleted/Extended Scenes   BD Live: Iron Man IQ    Blu-ray Disc 2:    I Am Iron Man The Journey Begins  The Suit that makes the Iron Man  The Walk of Destruction  Grounded In Reality  Beneath the Armor  It's All in the Details  A Good Story, Well Told  Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man   Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test   The Actor's Process (scene rehearsal with cast)   The Onion \\"Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full Length Film\\"   Theatrical Trailers   Image Galleries    Overall 10 out of 10, this is how a superhero movie gets done and how a BD is made.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I can't understand why so many people have given this album four stars - every song is masterfully written and executed - and don't even get me started on the Exogenesis Symphony...are you kidding me?  What other band can do this?  What other band has the guts to do this?  Here's your answer: NONE.  Muse is all about the music, and they consistently push the envelope.  Pure genious!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Most of the previous reviews got it right: this book is not for readers, a rather pedestrian story, little plot, and I wish I had gotten the library copy.
B001GCUO16|3.0|As Marvel's first in a planned line of \\"origin\\" stories, Wolverine appropriately starts back in 1845, when our hero is but a sickly pup in the wilds of Canada. Young James Howlett--get it, Howlett--unexpectedly sprouts spiny, bone-like claws in rage when the man he thinks is his father is killed by the man who actually is his father. It makes sense on screen, I swear. After murdering his real dad with a fist-first bum-rush, James runs off with his similarly mutated half-brother Victor Creed. The credit sequence shows the two taking part in one hundred years of conflict, from the regimented lines of the Civil War, all the way through to the horrors of Vietnam. The purpose of this is two-fold; we realize that the brothers have stuck together for over a century, but we also see them subtly growing apart. Played by Hugh Jackman for the fourth time now, James--now known as Logan--tries to rein in his animal nature, while his bro Victor (Liev Schreiber) lets loose with his primal instincts. The story begins in earnest when the two face the firing squad and, not unexpectedly, live to tell the tale.     Wolverine goes into violently rage on Blu-ray with an impressive 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer. I'm not going to lie--the issues that so many people mentioned during the theatrical release are still here, clearly defined in high definition. Of course, I'm talking about the occasionally all-too-obvious CGI. That said, this is a review of the film's transfer, not the special effects, and as such, I just have to say that the film looks great on Blu-ray.     The color palette is rich and vibrant; with a good sense of contrast overall and skin tones that are pleasingly warm. The picture can also be exceptionally sharp at times. Just check out Jackman's face as he sits in military prison--each pore, crease, and drop of sweat is rendered clearly. There are a few soft moments, specifically some of the long landscapes and the occasional medium shot, but most of the film is crisp and detailed, with fine textures apparent throughout.    The title doesn't really exhibit the sense of depth that the best Blu-ray discs can offer, though, as the CGI can make the image look flat at times. But really, I have few complaints here. Black levels are well tuned throughout the film, and though there's no overt crush or grey soupiness, a few shots could stand to be tweaked darker or lighter. The opening scene did seem a little dim to me, but hey, it's lit mostly by candlelight.     I'm giving the film a solid 8 out of 10, I do feel I have to take the CGI into account for the overall visual experience--but feel free to mentally slide the score up to 9 if needed, after all no major flaws in the BD.    I'll be the first to admit that Wolverine got a tough break. Between studio interventions and a not-quite-finished work print being leaked online before the release, the film got a thorough critical lambasting before it even arrived in theaters, and that was kept in our minds also for the BD release. Hopefully, the inevitable sequel reportedly set during Logan's time in Japan, will learn from the movie's mistakes, and maybe even take a few lessons from The Dark Knight and Iron Man about how to tell an absorbing comic book story. Until then, Wolverine is a flawed but occasionally fun watch that looks fantastic in high definition, well, BD that is... sounds great with lossless audio, and fills out a 50-GB Blu-ray disc with enough special features to keep fans occupied for several hours, at least. The overall quality of the total package definitely warrants a recommendation, keeping in mind that this is not a perfect BD.
B000002JEV|5.0|I love the first two Zep albums.  Unbelievable classics.  I was lucky enough to see them 1971 before the 3rd lp came out.  They previewed it live, Page using his bow, Plant having his quintessinal lead vocalist stage presence.  Nuttin' like Zep live.  This BBC material is really live in the studio and as such it's classic songs from the albums but presented with a live flavor and therefore, as Led Zeppelin would do, not performed the same as their album tracks.  Very enjoyable cds.  Worth the investment.  In fact, if you were looking for something besides the studio tracks off the albums and wondered about what live material to get, this is a cost efficient one to buy.  I also liked How the West Was Won, more excellent live and, of course, in that case with an arena audience.
B0029XFN8A|3.0|The honest answer is no.  And that is extensive to the unrated version of the movie.  Why? Ok let me se...      For a movie that is only 5 or 6 years old, the transfer shouldn't look older than it does. The transfer is just a modest upgrade of the less-than-reference quality picture included on the original DVD.     Too much noise/grain and inconsistent color levels are the main offenders here, with the occasional edge enhancement creeping in as well. Night time and indoor scenes have the most issues, but our first reveal of Cuthbert in a wet, white shirt looks near-perfect, picture-wise. Colors are mostly set to a permanent dull hue, and in some instances are muddy, which is surprising given the quality of most Fox offerings. Trust me, this isn't blu-ray quality.    So if you have the DVD version of it, stick to it and don't change it for the Blu-ray version, you can even find a DVD unrated adaptation of it, plus you won't loose money on it!       As for the extras and unrated part:    The 16 Deleted or Extended Scenes are definitely worth watching. You have a play all option with commentary from director Greenfield. One scene featured actress Amanda Swinton losing it when she had to put a condom on Klitz, who wore a fencing mask to do the scene. She struggles to keep a straight face and loses it at the end. Most were cut for pacing purposes, which is a shame, because a lot of these scenes had moments of genuine emotion that really humanized the movie. We also get the original ending that - get this - Greenfield cut because people at the test screenings thought Matthew was in the White House when he's standing in front of the Capitol Building...anyways...     The movie's first trip on Blu comes with most of the bonus content present on the unrated SD release.     * Audio Commentary by Luke Greenfield   * Scene Specific Commentary by Emile Hirsch   * Scene Specific Commentary by Elisha Cuthbert   * \\"The Eli Experience\\" Featurette   * \\"A Look Next Door\\" Making-Of Featurette   * Gag Reel   * Deleted and Extended Scenes (Including the Original Ending)   * Theatrical Trailer, \\"Dirty\\" Edition       The only extra missing from the previous SD release is the Pop-Up trivia track, but viewers aren't missing much. The stand-outs here are the director's commentary and \\"The Eli Experience\\" featurette. The unrated version is nine minutes longer, but they are nine minutes that do nothing for the movie but increase its running time, and pad it out with an extra few seconds of nudity. So for you people, that means the disc gets the DVD equivalent to a Cable Ace award.     \\"The Eli Experience\\" is a riot. Chris Marquette, who plays Eli, goes to the Adult Industry Expo, held during CES, and mingles with the porn stars. In a Howard Stern moment, hulking ex-pro wrestler Matt 'Horshu' Wiese walks up to men at the expo asking them if they want to make out with him. Man this has to be seen!    As for \\"A Look Next Door\\" is a standard making-of EPK, and the Gag Reel runs three minutes long as features many on-set screw ups. It's funnier than most gag reels, but it's not worth a repeat viewing.    The movie isn't awful, but you would think the Blu-ray version is better than it really is. The direction is component, but unremarkable, the performances are fun but not unified, and the Blu is one of the weakest catalog titles Fox has released on the format so far. Watch the movie; it's acceptable rainy day entertainment. But don't trade in your DVD for the supreme BD experience, because it is not there. Ironically, most of us wouldn't have seen the movie in the first place if they didn't agree to casting Elisha Cuthbert.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Takes me places I didn't expect to go.  A journey to the heart of evil that formed a scar on the 20th century of human history.  Precious, well acted by our lead and a treat from Liev as director.  A very worthy effort.  I developed a sentimental attachment to the film with it's ups and downs, it's new adventures around another corner and it's eventual resolution.  Very much a through the looking glass or into and return from Oz of an ordinary American with roots that lead him to illumination.  We are all illuminated from the path taken.  Well done.  Very enjoyable.  Recommended.
B00164GDD2|5.0|And the answer is absolutely YES!    I won't get caught in the main synopsis of the movie, I'm guessing you know the story and the actors. If not you should be asking your self where have you been the last twenty years or so...now lets get into it!     Video Quality on this release is in full 1080p using the MPEG-4 codec on a BD-50 (50 gigabyte dual-layered Blu-ray Disc). This is a great catalog release. It is so refreshing to see a studio not attempt tweaking the original image with digital noise reduction and edge enhancement. This is a faithful to the source transfer. Clarity and resolution is where this transfer shines, all the little signs, switches, knobs and so forth are all clearly defined displaying an excellent depth of field. Colors are nicely saturated and accurate displaying good natural hues.     As for the Bonus Materials: these are presented in Standard Definition 480i and High Definition 1080i with Dolby Digital 2.0 sound.    * BD-Live - Keep in mind that BD-Live requires the user to be on a \\"Profile 2.0\\" capable Blu-ray Disc Player and connected to the Internet to access online content via the studio (in this case Sony). Once online you can access content such as downloadable trailers for other Sony Blu-ray Disc release upcoming and already available. Title specific content in this case is actually included. 2 different Ring tones are available which are just dialogue from the film. Standard rates apply to get these I'm sure, nothing is 100% free these days.     * \\"Cinechat\\" - This BD-live application allows viewers to chat with friends and family while watching the film. A easy to understand tutorial is included.     * \\"Slimer Mode\\" is a Blu-ray exclusive feature that is using Bonus View which requires the user to be on a \\"Profile 1.1\\" or higher capable Blu-ray Disc Player. If you are capable of it, this is worth the time to watch all the way through. A neat \\"Ghostbusters\\" border frames the film while it's playing; at the same time a Picture-In-Picture track plays interview clips featuring the cast and crew looking back at the production. It is complemented with additional still photographs and behind-the-scenes video. A pop-up trivia track is also inserted into the mix, showcasing interesting facts about the film and its shooting locations.     * \\"Blu-Wizard\\" - A BD-Java feature that will allow viewers to create their own play list of special features by selecting only those of interest. Once activated, a pop-up marker indicates when that particular feature is available to view.       * Audio Commentary - Director Ivan Reitman is joined by co-writer/actor Harold Ramis and associate producer Joe Medjuck. It is unfortunate that they weren't able to update the commentary (originally recorded in 1999 for the DVD release) with thoughts from Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, or Sigourney Weaver. This is very informative track but unfortunately it comes across as dry. Opcional subtitles are included.     * \\"Scene Cemetery\\" (9 minutes - SD) - This is a collection of 10 deleted scenes that while fun to see in their own right aren't missed in the film.       * \\"1984 Featurette\\" (9:45 - SD) - This is a fun vintage featurette shot for the original 1984 release. Featuring behind-the-scenes footage and short interviews with cast and crew talking about the various aspects of making this beloved movie.     * \\"Cast and Crew Featurette\\" (10:53 - SD) -This is a short 11 minute featurette originally recorded for the 1999 DVD release.It is a collection of interviews with Ivan Reitman, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis talking about the film and its impact in general.       * \\"SFX Team Featurette\\" (15:22 - SD) - This is a panel discussion with the original F/X team.They discuss their experience of working on the film.     * \\"Multi-Angle Featurettes\\" (SD) - This is broken into three sections: \\"Spook Central Exploding\\" (2:49), \\"She's A Dog\\" (2:00), and \\"Crossing the Streams\\" (1:23). Here you can watch the rough video and animation work inbefore-and-after stages from three particular scenes.       * \\"Storyboard Comparisons\\" (SD) - Also broken into three sections: \\"Slimer\\" (2:13), \\"Dogs Drag Dana\\" (2:09), and \\"Atop Spook Central\\" (2:04). you can watch the hand-drawn storyboards and compare them to the film's finished cut.     * \\"Ecto-1: Resurrecting the Classic Car\\" (15:37 - HD) - Sony and the filmmakers had the hero car restored to its original glory for the promotion of \\"Ghostbusters: The Video Game\\". Interview clips include Dan Aykroyd and the talented crew of people who worked on the refurbishment of the 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor Ambulance. The real treat is seeing the process of breaking down the car and building it back up to look better than it ever has. Once it is restored Dan Aykroyd was invited to see the Ecto-1 in all it's glory and it is a pleasure seeing the genuine joy he displays at being reunited with the old girl.       * \\"Making of Ghostbusters: The Video Game\\" (11:18 - HD) - A promotional fluff piece for the video game has the cast and creators sharing their thoughts about the game and its storyline. Brief clips of the video game are interspersed throughout. The game looks like a fun trip down memory lane. The graphics look authentic to the \\"Ghostbusters\\" films.     * \\"Ghostbusters Garage: Ecto-1 Gallery\\" (HD) - This is a beautiful slide show highlighting the restoration process, whilst Elmer Bernstein's music plays in the background.       * \\"Ghostbusters: The Video Game Preview\\" (1:43 - HD) - Simply this is the trailer for the now available video game.     * Theatrical Trailers (HD) - A collection of previews in HD `The Da Vinci Code: Extended Cut,' `Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' `Men in Black,' `Fired Up!,' `Paul Blart: Mall Cop,' `So I Married an Axe Murderer,' and `You Don't Mess With the Zohan'.     Hope this was useful.  At the end if you ask me this si a must have!
0345479092|5.0|I see a lot of negative reviews here from people who want to be patted on the head for exclusively breast-feeding and putting their baby's desires above their own and so forth. This book is all about finding the best compromises for optimizing a family's happiness, including the baby's. This may include formula instead or in addition to breast feeding, and probably involves putting a baby in her own bed so parents can sleep and make love in their own. God knows the world does NOT need another \\"formula is rat poison!!!1!1!\\" manifesto: obviously women who choose not to breast feed have their reasons, and parenting is hard enough without strangers mooing ignorant disapproval at a perfectly valid choice.     Her advice about environment is generally good too. For instance, it makes sense to feed your newborn in as calm a spot as you can (although I personally am going to watch TV at a reasonable volume while doing it, which I think she disrecommends, but whatever, this is advice, not canon law.) In general I found Tracy's advice spot on and I used it successfully in raising a calm, happy child who sleeps well, eats well, and behaves herself.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This 2008 movie is way better than the 2003 version of Ang Lee.    Now to answer the question: is the BD version of the 2008 movie really incredible?     For starters The Incredible Hulk offers viewers, well, an incredible amount of bonus materials. A commentary track featuring director Louis Leterrier and actor Tim Roth is first. The track begins with the work that went into the film's opening credit sequence. Not only does this sequence pay homage to the original television show, but it sets up the film by establishing itself as a separate entity from Ang Lee's film (thank God!). From there, the track offers fairly standard stuff, with some light discussion of sets and shooting locations, Stan Lee's cameo, the work of the other cast and crew members, the special effects, make-up, sound design, and other tidbits. It's a very average track, worth a listen for hardcore fans, but skippable for most of us. The Incredible Hulk is also U-Control enabled. There are several options to choose from. The Thunderbolt Files provides biographies of various characters, Bruce Banner's location, and Ross' mission parameters. Scene Explorer allows viewers to see various sequences in the film in several stages of development. Comic Book Gallery shows various images from the Hulk comics. Animated Comic showcases how scenes from the film were influenced by scenes found in previous comic books. Finally, a standard picture-in-picture feature is available that features behind-the-scenes videos, cast and crew interviews, and more.    An alternate opening to the film (1080p, DTS-HD MA 5.1, 2:34) is next, followed by 23 deleted scenes (480p, 42:45). The Making of Incredible (1080i, 29:54) examines Louis Letterier's initial involvement and the strengths he brought to the film, the casting of the primary characters, shooting locations, special effects, shooting techniques, and more.    The Incredible Hulk is BD-Live (Blu-ray profile 2.0) enabled. The disc offers a brief text-based introductionto the technology. Upon accessing the BD-Live home page, users must first create an account to access the extra content. The main page is attractive and easy to navigate.    The Incredible Hulk is a fine example of a comic book movie done right. It offers amazing visuals and plenty of action, but, more important to the story, never falters in the areas of character development and narrative, which are crucial in creating a fulfilling cinematic experience. The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Bat Man Begins and The Dark Knight are all shining examples of the comic book-based movie done absolutely right, and 2008 will be remembered as one of the best years the genre has seen to date. Universal brings The Incredible Hulk to Blu-ray in a package that is a definite must-own. Featuring excellent video quality and a reference-grade soundtrack that raises the bar for action movie extravaganza mixes, not to mention a jam-packed supplemental section, a digital copy of the film, and a unique green-colored Blu-ray case, the disc is impossible to resist. The Incredible Hulk comes highly recommended to all comic book-based movie fans.    Are you still reading this? Go and buy it now!
B0025KVLS8|5.0|The opening chord of track 1 warns us that something special is about to happen---and it does! \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" contains some of The Beatles greatest early rockers like \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"Tell Me Why\\",\\"I Should Have Known Better\\" and the title track. At the same time it also features two of their most beautiful ballads, \\"If I Fell\\" and Paul McCartney's first step up to mature song writing, \\"And I Love Her.\\" In fact, there's not a bad song on here from start to finish. As for the sound comparison to the previous release(released in mono only)--there simply isn't any. The remastered stereo version is bright, clean and sharp. The vocals, guitars and drums are all stunning and there's a freshness present that makes you feel like you're hearing these classic songs for the first time.  Listening to this 1964 recording, it's easy to see why Beatlemania was sweeping the world. An absolute must for Beatle fans or any lovers of 1960's pop rock.

B00005N6KG|4.0|Good headphones. I got them to replace my old folding ones that are no longer available.  Sound quality is quite good, and I'm a fan of the vertical in-the-ear style as it doesn't eliminate ambient sounds (which I need with a family who's always yelling at me to go, do, get, fetch, etc.).  And my ears are too big to hold the ear buds in place.  So... these suit me just fine, I just wish they'd fold for storage. The cord is a bit short.  Another six inches would be ok.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|P&P has a well-deserved spot amongst the classics. It's insightful, humorous, poignant and impeccably well crafted. As an astute observer of human nature, Austen was a genius at creating characters. I've read the novel numerous times in print, but I appreciate it in electronic form, too.
0307474275|4.0|The story and pacing were very entertaining.  Is Dan Brown the best author in my opinion?  No.  Did this book change any of my beliefs?  No.  It is fiction afterall. But, did I enjoy reading this book?  Yes.  Will I be reading other books by Dan Brown?  Definitely, yes!  He does tell a good story.
B002JODUI4|5.0|If you think that Random Album Title is better than this album, than you have never produced music before.  Some of the tracks must, I REPEAT MUST, be listened to on a very powerful stereo to truly appreciate them.  The progression of this album is brilliant, although I was fine with just Moar Ghosts N Stuff, because everyone has heard the version with Rob Swire a million times over the last few months.  But the evolution of the sound on this album into Strobe at the end, which may be the best song he has ever written, is unreal.  If you love progressive than you will be wasting time in your life if you do not own this album.

0743298039|4.0|It took me three attempts to get into reading this book...primarily due to the fact that the first few chapters move very slow. But, once I got past that first portion it just kept getting better and better.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and easy to sympathize with. The story is engaging, heart-felt and full of surprises.<br /><br />Very good read. Would recommend this to anyone!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is like nothing else I have ever scene. Normally you have composite shots stiched together over days to give you patchwork insight into the lives are certain animals. I have seen glorious animal shows before, but this is something else. Single continuous camera shots, tracking individual animals through the most insane events in their lives, with the camera often picking up the individual in advance of the onset of the event, all the way through closure. This is all predator/prey footage, but gloriously raw and uplifting and I actually found myself rooting for the predator more often than the burger.

1593083343|5.0|I just recieved my copy of this wonderful work by Jane Austin and, even though I have hardly had time to crack open the beautiful cover, I must say the edging on the pages is exactly as they say: It is uneven and roughly cut. Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.<br />I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!
B002BWP47E|5.0|'The September Issue' is a superb piece of work.  I watch a lot of documentaries...this one ranks near the top (though Leon Gast's [[ASIN:B00007ELEK When We Were Kings]] still holds the crown).  I expected no less from R.J. Cutler, producer of [[ASIN:B0002JUXDS The War Room]], but it exceeded my expectations.  More than any film I've seen, it captures the hard work and relentless attention to detail that goes into making an enterprise like [[ASIN:B00005N7TG Vogue (1-year)]] a world leader.<br /><br />Cutler's film also humanizes Vogue's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, who lets us in - if ever so slightly - to her world.  We see her with CEOs, world-class designers, Conde Nast corporate staff and, delightfully, at home in a relaxed conversation with her daughter.  We also see Anna as industry hub and power broker, here placing up-and-coming designer Thaksoon into a deal with The Gap.  [It's emblematic of the many similar deals that Ms. Wintour has swung, Thom Browne + Brooks Brothers being one of the better known examples.]<br /><br />Cutler also skillfully juxtaposes Wintour with Vogue senior stylist and director, Grace Coddington.  Though ostensibly Wintour's star turn, it's the talent, drive and guts of Ms. Coddington that make her the film's heart.<br /><br />How did Vogue come to be the hub of the fashion world?  Watch this film to see how.
0385504225|1.0|I am deeply disappointed in this book; it took Mr. Brown six years to write it?  He should have taken six more if only to see if he could come up with a better story. The formulaic cliffhangers at the end of (it seemed) every chapter were at one point unbearable...so much so that I started skimming thru the pages.  Did Robert Langdon have a brain injury in his last book that I'm not aware of?  Why was he so skeptical of everything? You have a hard time believing \\"the mystery\\" really! Did the past experiences not teach you anything?  He also seemed to be dumbed down in this book.  The mystery revelation was beyond stupid; was the Bible a forbidden book when our country was formed?  If that's the case then I can suspend belief and say ok, maybe they did need that much mystery behind it.  I could go on and on about how terrible this book is but it just makes me mad that I was duped into running out to get it.  Next time, Mr. Brown, it's going to be a paperback at the used book store or a garage sale - and that's if there are no other books available.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|NUGGETS-ORIGINAL ARTYFACTS FROM THE FIRST PSYCHEDELIC ERA (4 CD BOX SET): The Patti Smith Group's Lenny Kaye coined the phrase \\"NUGGETS\\" for down 'n dirty lo-fi garage/psychedelic ditties recorded in the late sixties by one-chord wonders with wonderfully preposterous names like Strawberry Alarm Clock, the 13th Floor Elevators, and the Electric Prunes. Kaye's original NUGGETS compilation (later augmented to this 4 disc box set) contained the stuff of a thousand punk and roll acts to come; these garbled one-off smashes and semi-underground class-sicks have been mined endlessly ever since. Alice Cooper paid lip service to Music Machine's TALK TALK, The Cramps tackled the Count Five's PSYCHOTIC REACTION, and John Belushi's appropriately sloppy version of the Kingsmen's LOUIE LOUIE popped up in ANIMAL HOUSE. Future miscreants Ted Nugent, Leslie West, and Warren Zevon all cut their fangs in primitive acts like the Amboy Dukes, The Vagrants, and Lyme & Cybell respectively. A snotty attitude counted far more than a perfect solo (although Nugent exhibited both), and most of these ragtag ensembles had snarl to spare...WOOLY BULLY's greasy Tex-Mex groove, keg-a-riffic singalong DOUBLE SHOT OF MY BABY'S LOVE, the Jagger-esque gems DIRTY WATER and LITTLE GIRL, and several dozen more tracks of whack make NUGGETS an avalanche of the absolute \\"grundgiest\\" that sixties rock had to offer.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE SOUR NOTES
0439023483|5.0|Oh what a story.    I found the dark realism of the story to be my favorite part. The truth is, I think that we could easily lead ourselves down the path to the world that Suzanne Collins created in The Hunger Games, no matter how horrifying and depraved it may seem. There is a ring of truth to everything that happens in the story, which makes it scary and believable.    The characters are pretty accurate too. I've read reviews complaining that the characters, particularly Katniss, were not very heroic or exhibited too much of a selfish nature, and I agree. She does. They all do. And I think it is irrational to think that anyone who wanted to live wouldn't do exactly what they had to do to make it...or they'd perish without being able to find a \\"fight\\" inside of them. The fact that these characters have to lose something of themselves just to get by day to day is one of the most powerful parts of the story. I do not begrudge the characters their choices. I'd have been suspicious if they had acted righteous and noble. Most people aren't. Sorry.    I read through the book in two nights, barely breathing, often shaking, crying at multiple points throughout the story. I think that the landscape is rich and the details well chosen. The story is scary in a way that I was not expecting. The kids involved in the games wounded me. It was hard to focus on any of them for fear of losing them. I would like to say that I can't imagine how it must feel to be in that society, in that situation, but thanks to the Hunger Games and my imagination, I can imagine it. And it is terrifying.     For those reviews I've read that complain bitterly that it is too much like The Long Walk or Battle Royale, I say, not really. There are similarities, but you can say that about more stories, that they feel like others. Just because the setting is similar, or how they got there is similar, doesn't mean this isn't a good book. The Long Walk frightened me and kept me on the edge of my seat when I read it many years ago, Battle Royale did not interest me at all. It is an individual thing, I think. If there is anything that The Hunger Games lacks it is that I thought there was a lot less blood shed than there could have been. The number of deaths we witness in first person are pretty minimal. Most of the competition is gone early. I might have liked to see more tense fights, more sobering, scary murders. But where it lacks in first person blood shed it more than makes up for in psychological torture. Psychological warfare is where Suzanne Collins shines brighter than any of the other similar stories.

B00005LC1H|5.0|This series definitely stands the test of time! John Cleese ia as funny as ever and is supported by a wonderful cast including the brilliant Prunella Scales as his wife.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|As the booklet in the mono box says, some tracks on the White Album are better in mono, some stereo. This seems to be because the Beatles were more involved in the stereo work for this later album, and Martin made fewer of his own artistic choices and changes in the stereo mix, unlike \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", where he materially changed the albums and damaged them in his stereo mix, with the Beatles absent for that process.      Here's how the \\"White\\" preferred mixes break down to my ears :     Side One : Mono 3-6, 8-9, 15-17. Stereo 1-2, 7, 10-14.   Side Two : Mono 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. Stereo 1-2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.     Martin tended to mix the voice as if it were an instrument; the Beatles were not beautiful conventional singers (and didn't try to be on most songs) but their voices were very distinctive. Martin obscures this with his mixes, the voice blends into the tapestry. Of course the stereo is almost always more dynamic on the White Album, but the deep bass and other strong layers often hide or obscure what should be central - the voice, first among equals. This is also true at times with instrumental lines, which you'd think would always be clearer in the stereo but aren't. This fogging doesn't happen on the rockers so much, hence the choices. But on the more nuanced emotional songs the mono is almost always preferable. When an instrumental element is supposed to take center stage - Clapton's guitar on \\"Weeps\\" or the harpsichord on \\"Piggies\\", the stereo serves the song better. When a song is tongue in cheek and a dated sound is intended, \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Goodbye\\", the mono is greatly preferable. Martin's mix of \\"Goodbye\\" falls over into being unctuous.     This was not an accident in my opinion, it was the condescension towards 'the boys' who were golden gooses but not taken completely seriously. George Martin was the adult in the room, you know. Terrific producer, he wasn't the creative talent 'the boys were, and with the goods to compare, it shows.There is a pattern of this in cultural history, popular artists being considered lucky or crude (as they often are) even when they also happen to be deeply talented. That was the story with Shakespeare as well in his time; another recent example being Steven Spielberg.     Ideal would be a mix that kept the focus and choices of the mono, the artists' choices, but with the dynamics of the stereo format. I believe that is what Martin was supposed to do, but only achieved it on \\"Abbey Road\\" (when I think Paul stood over him) and on some \\"White\\" cuts, but not all - almost exactly half. Even with \\"Abbey\\" the mono LP (supposedly a 'folddown') is slightly superior to the stereo LP, but there will be no mono mix CD to compare. The mono \\"Revolution Number Nine\\" is supposed to be a folddown too - if it is, the technique needs to be revived, because however illogical it may be, it works. As someone who is a sound restorer, illogical - even counter-logical techniques yield results that shouldn't be. Music is an art in the end, whatever science you can apply to it.     A two song nutshell : \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" in mono is very moving and subtle, instead of the passing time interlude it seems to be in stereo; while the following \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide\\" in stereo is cowbell heaven, and relatively monochromatic in mono.
B001GCUER0|5.0|If you liked Mad Men in its first seson, you will love the second season. We continue to see the life of these Madison  Avenue men who live their hard boozing and womanizing lives while defining new territories in advertising. We also obersve the effects on their entourage, wives, secretaries etc. The series continues to concentrate on Don Darper who continues his time as a creative genius at Sterling Cooper all while suffering the effects of success: high blood pressure, excessive drinking. Overall the writing has improved and the season is somewhat less bleak than at the beginning. It provides perfectly a sense of the era it represents: the 60's. All the characters are strongly played, especially the women who are not just side characetrs as they sometimes are in such series. This is clearly the best series around at the moment so do not hesitate: it is indispensable.
1597801577|5.0|Thai generip terror.    It Bacigalupi ever writes anything that is sweetness and light, that right there would be likely proof of the Many Worlds Theory and the fact that you had slipped into an alternate universe.    The setting is Bangkok, or, colloquially, Krung Thep. It is also a near future dystopia. The city now houses many displaced Chinese refugees from a Malaysia turned fundamentalist muslim fanatics. (See his story Yellow Card Man for background) Bangkok itself is only kept from drowning by engineering and technology.    This is a post-oil world, with very little petroleum technology available, remaining. No evidence of solar tech, either, really. Power is provided by human labor and genetically engineered highly efficient animals pourding kinetic energy into springs, which then can be used to power machines. Treadle computers, even. Countries have shrunk in upon themselves as a result, but are beginning to look outward again, with ships, and dirigibles. This makes this setting rather unlike the mass-media or AI ridden future India and Brasil etc. of Ian McDonald's devising.    Particularly nasty are the 'calorie companies' - organisations that have the ability to manufacture crops in large supply: but their crops are sterile, so you always need to go back for more. That is if bugs and plagues 'weevils' and 'blister rust' do not get them. Much dirty, violent dealing in support of this activity (see his story The Calorie Man) and there are mentions of it going horribly wrong in other countries. One of the questions this raises is how they manage to stay around - why, with such hatred of them, are the calorie men and women not mercilessly hunted and slaughtered. The only intimations you get of this are economic power, based in the USA. Also China is apparently dysfunctional, and many other countries are devastated. Thailand, through foresight, is struggling on, and is hence a point of interest. Their genetic stocks and the genetic engineering expert they have on hand to help defend them are of interest to all.    The rapidly mutating diseases caused by genetic engineering meddling and conflict kill many - with mainly the calorie companies having the resources to combat their own hellish offspring, if they care to. Mutated cats with no real predators except humans have also destroyed a lot of the food chain.    The novel has many viewpoints:     Anderson Lake, An American calorie man representative, brought in to try and increase productivity at a factory working on more efficient power springs. More than he seems, however.    Hock Seng, The Yellow Card Man, an elderly fallen Chinese merchant who escaped massacres and now works for Lake.    Emiko, The Windup Girl. A Japanese artificially created human. Unable to reproduce, overheats easily but has many unknown talents. Left behind by her owner, currently a working bar girl.    Kanya, an officer in the Environment Ministry's corps of field soldiers responsible for protecting the city from incursions of disease, animals and artificial humans.    Conflict develops from many angles - there is longstanding resentment between the Environment Ministry and Trade Ministry because of different philosophies, inward, and outward looking, respectively. The foreign merchants look to exploit this. Then there is of course anti-refugee racism. As mentioned before, and historically, the Asian against Asian racism or nationalism is quite horrific.    The novel leaves you uneasy the whole way through, but fascinated. After many thousands of stories I am not easy to surprise. I had no idea what the hell was going to happen in this book, apart from the fact that it was likely to be bloody. The writing is excellent. Bacigalupi is a major talent, if unfortunately not very prolific.    Hard to predict, but I think this novel is quite likely to be important in the sense of SF history. It is brilliant, in its all sweating dystopian style.    Forget whatever else you are reading, and speed browseto Webscriptions where this is a available multiformat DRM free (thankfully, given its theme). Hopefully it will do well enough so his collection 'Pump Six' becomes available, too. This is good enough to buy in any or all varieties, however.    It is that rare beast, a 5 star novel. Great at the start, great in the middle, great at the end.    5 out of 5
B0025KVLS8|4.0|Lower your expectations and you will not be disappointed. While it is true that songs such as \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" sound better on the remixed \\"1\\", this has never been promoted as remixed - but remastered. From the start - it was stressed that the mixes would not be tampered with. So, how well did they do? Besides the fact that this is finally out in a legal stereo version which in my opinion runs rings around the mono (which is NOT true for the first two albums) - the harmonies are clearer - Ringo's drums are punchier even if he still suffers in the mix (one of the best arguments for a remix)- Paul's bass notes are clearer and the guitars have more clarity (especially the acoustics). The rockers seem to have more get up and go with the clearer sounding rhythm section. This album and \\"Beatles For Sale\\" actually benefit the most on the reissues - not only for being in stereo but also for improved clarity. The later (and for many people better) Beatle albums may get the attention but these two albums should never be overlooked. Great music when the band was at its tightest. So... why 4 stars and not 5? I'm not happy with the packaging although I have seen worse and the advertised mini-documentary is quite pathetic - I would have passed it up with glee to have a matching mono version on the same disc - it could have easily been done as the album itself is only about 30 minutes long. Still, I highly recommend it.

B001GCUNWQ|3.0|Cute animated flick. I don't think the 3D element was played up enough in the graphics, though, so I feel like I wasted my money on that. The family theme was number one in this Ice Age. The adult humor was good, but it was still child-friendly. There were a lot of sweet moments, and the action/adventure in the underground dino-world contrasted nicely with the feel-good stuff. I like how the T-Rex befriended Sid, that was cute. The cuteness factor went way off the charts. I did enjoy the movie, but I felt like there was something missing the whole time...not sure what, though.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|SPOILER ALERT! Don't continue reading if you don't want to know....<br /><br />Basically Ryan Reynolds' character is an assistant/slave to Sandra Bullock's character aka his boss from Hell, and he waits for the day when she'll turn to him with a smile instead of a demand and say he's getting his chance as an author, but, before that day will come, he has to do a little illegal pretending to help his beautiful boss out of a bind so she won't end up back in Canada and no longer in a position to make things happen for his career. You can guess from the title what's involved in their scheme. Very funny indeed. Betty White is wonderful. Sandra Bullock's dance around the fire with Betty White was hilarious. All the supporting cast was great. I thoroughly enjoyed the Alaskan setting. Also, there is no other way to say it - Ryan Reynolds is soooo hot, especially in the nude, and Sandra Bullock has done a really good job of keeping her body looking smokin', too. Their accidental naked body slam was well timed and tasteful, so the teens don't need to leave the room for any parents out there. The end theme, of course, if you love someone let them go and they'll come back to you, worked out really well. Romantic movies are my weakness. Oh, one more thing, I loved Sandra Bullock's hair in this movie. She's just gorgeous.
0618918248|4.0|...if you are not a religious person, that is. If you are, you won't want to read it - but you WILL want to review it so you can give it 1 star.    I had a strict (at times very strict) Catholic upbringing, being forced to attend every church service going. By the age of 8 I had read the Bible cover to cover at least 5 times. By the age of 10 I wanted to be an Alter Boy, probably mostly to please my mother. By the age of 12 I no longer believed a word of it and found I could no longer force myself to sit through any church service without wanting to shout \\"liar\\" at the priest! The ideas of an all-loving omnipotent God as espoused by Christians are full of so many contradictions that it is impossible to take them seriously without a desperate NEED to believe there is something/someone that will absolve you of final responsibility. For instance, God purportedly gave man free will - then he says if you do anything against my wishes (and you have no idea what those are!) you will go to hell for all eternity, where you will burn in agony. So what this seems to be saying is God gave man free will as long as man does exactly what God wants (despite not knowing!) Not exactly free will, is it? And not exactly all-loving, either. Capricious would seem like a better description. No, I don't believe a word of it.    Richard Dawkins uses his scientific background to assemble a thoughtful account of the contradictions inherent in religion and their knock-on effects for wider society. I have to say I do not agree with Dawkins with regard to Darwinism - the (suppressed) historical archaeological record is very clear that modern man (Homo Sapiens Sapiens) has existed alongside other hominid strains, as he does today, for millions of years. I also don't agree that there are only two alternatives; the existence of God or Darwinian evolution. But this does not detract overly from my general agreement with his overall thesis: that religion, ALL religion, rather than being a force for good, is a force for evil, suppressing knowledge, thought and unity in favour of ignorance, bigotry and division.    It is high time to create a world without politics, without religion, and most importantly without money. I recommend the online video Zeitgeist Addendum which shows how this can be created - now. Or read/watch anything by Jacques Fresco, a true visionary.

B002KVSJ7S|5.0|You never know what to expect from an artist after a successful first album. Which direction will they take now that they've established their self? Mika does not disappoint and doesn't alter the formula in any drastic way.<br /><br />I personally feel the first track and single \\"We Are Golden\\" is one of the weaker songs on this album, so if you were turned off by it, don't let that alter your decision for listening to the rest of it.<br /><br />What stands out so much on this album is its great blend of fun and artistic elements. Most pop music is fun to listen to, but lacks depth and doesn't offer much beyond its face value. Mika is appealing to casual listeners and musicians alike.<br /><br />What bumps this from a 4 star album to a 5 star album for me is the track \\"Pick Up Off The Floor\\". After bopping your head for almost an entire album, he hits you with an extremely bluesy, yet modern ballad. It really completes the package and seals off a great sequel to his debut album.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\", you will enjoy this just as much, if not more. Keep up the bold music, Mika, it's very refreshing.
B002DKGWSE|3.0|I never saw the orginal and only heard about this one through a friend of mine at work. I found it ok. I was never really scared or terrified by anything that was going on but the rape scene was incredibly hard to watch and felt like it was going on for a good hour even though it had to have been only like 5 or 10 minutes long and in that regard I was left with an overall feeling of unease.    While there is the death scenes that occur after the parents find out the ppl staying in their guest house attacked their daughter, I wouldn't really say this is a horror film in the way one tends to think of them. To me it's more of a human emotional drama but to each their own.    And while you want to cheer the parents on for getting their revenge, you never feel that justice had been done.    All in all, it is a good movie and worth seeing if you're the type of person who can handle watching these kinds of scenes.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I guess I have been living under a rock since Leonard Cohen was new to me when I saw part of LIVE IN LONDON on PBS and immediately ordered the DVD.    How could I have missed him all this time??   Well now I am an instant fan and this DVD is so good I really am at a loss for words to describe it.  I knew a lot of the songs that had been done by other artists but had still missed the genius himself.    The music itself is so good that it stands up to different versions by different artists but I always come back to his versions as my favorites.  For example BIRD ON A WIRE was done by Johnny Cash and it seemed vintage Johnny Cash...........but Leonard gives it a whole new feeling when you see his from the heart version.   GET IT!!!!

'justice' isn't that great, it was merely good for that time)   it's too easy to parrot that metallica make the music that they want, because they don't; they also make music they want - which sucks.  there are today literally legions of students who long ago surpassed their master of puppets, pushing metal in directions that are still capable of surprising even the most jaded listener    seriously, if you must buy one metallica album then stick with 'kill 'em all', it was - and probably forever will be - their high water mark    1 star, by default          sincerely,   grumpy ole guy who is not living in the past
0792844890|5.0|John Candy has been in A LOT of films but none bring out his true nature like Spaceballs.      It's got everything: stunning visuals (not REALLY stunning, but sure, its got good visuals for the 80s), hilarious humors and jokes, and a REALLY intense plot (notice my sarcasism). Okay, the story may have been sort of easy, but either way, it was a great film! Laughter filled me up! A great film to watch!
0385504225|3.0|So here's the deal: plotting (A), characters (C), setting (C), plausibility (D), description (C+), set pieces (A), theme (C).  The Lost Symbol is conventional Dan Brown--a mystery to be solved by Robert Langdon, in the company of a woman, while he conjures with a bad guy and is being chased by a government agency.  The mystery involves symbology, numerology, the doings of a secret society and first and last things (i.e. faith, religion, the nature of reality, the cosmos, etc.).<br /><br />Comparisons with Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code are inevitable, because Brown has created a franchise designed to produce a reliable product.  This installment--The Lost Symbol--concerns freemasonry in Washington, D.C.  A mentor of Langdon's has been taken against his will.  Langdon partners with the mentor's sister to satisfy the demands of the mentor's captor and simultaneously reconstruct a pyramid, find a place and determine the key to wisdom that will facilitate the apotheosis of mankind.<br /><br />The bad guy's name is Moloch (we [and Milton] would spell it that way); he's covered in tattoos, takes steroids, has castrated himself and likes to look at himself in the mirror nude as well as kill members of Langdon's mentor's family.  The CIA director hot on Langdon's trail is short, female, and Japanese.  A heavy smoker, she has yellowed teeth and a moustache.  The mentor, Peter Solomon, is a 33rd degree mason/billionaire; his sister has a lab in which she is doing `noetic science', studying the ways in which mind affects matter.  No one has ever told Brown that less can sometimes be more.<br /><br />In the course of Langdon's race against time we get a tour of Washington, a city whose details Langdon knows much better than Brown, whose designation of neighborhoods and time/distance travel estimates will be seen as flawed by local residents.  The compensation for this shortcoming may be the set pieces in which Brown plays out the details of numerology, myth and symbology.  These are sometimes very impressive and very clever.<br /><br />The major problem with the book, in my opinion, is the theme.  It lacks the specificity of The DaVinci Code, a book with a theme that has been the subject of scholarship, a subject that concerns an essential issue in Catholicism, a subject that is controversial and engaging.  The subject of The Lost Symbol is much more diffuse.  For many it will be much less engaging.  Most (or at least many) will quickly figure out the site which Langdon is laboring to find and most will be disappointed by what he finds there, not because it is unimportant but because it is sufficiently `common' that one wonders why all the masons in the book are trying to protect it at great personal cost.  In short, the climax is anticlimactic in the extreme and it is followed by page after page of discourse which many readers will find preachy.<br /><br />Having said all that, the book will still hold most readers' attention; with the Amazon discount they will not feel that they have wasted their money and they will look forward to Dan Brown's next book.very impressive and very clever.

We have taken the ability for them to use their imagination out of the picture. They are given tv, video games and various negative thought-inducing activities every day. Give them this hour-plus of a fantastic imagination-producing movie to encourage them to come up with ideas of their own that they would like to see become a reality..
B001FB4W0W|4.0|True Blood is the latest hit show from HBO, and their biggest success since the heyday of The Sopranos. Based on the Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries by Charlaine Harris and developed for television by Alan Ball, creator of Six Feet Under, the show initially appears to be a trashy adult answer to the current craze for vampire books and films: the NC-17 version of Twilight, as it were. However, this is a simplistic analysis of the show, which is actually tackling a number of more interesting ideas and themes underneath its slightly sleazy veneer.    The show starts off a little slow, and it has to be said that the dancing around of the will they-won't they relationship between Sookie and Bill is a little tedious after the first couple of episodes. Luckily, the writers clearly aren't interested in keeping that going for the lifetime of the series, so they let the characters get together and see what happens next. This relationship is the core of the show and Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer (who amusingly first played a vampire in the brilliant Ultraviolet mini-series a decade ago) sell it very well (and they got into a real-life relationship shortly after starting the show as well). Moyer as Bill in particular has some nice moments as he is very much a Southern courtly gentleman from the Civil War era making an effort to go 'mainstream', but he also doesn't have any problems with killing people who have wronged him or tasting human blood as long as he doesn't kill them. This somewhat hypocritical attitude is played well, but he isn't entirely called on it before the end of the season, so it's unclear if it's deliberate or not. Paquin has a much harder role to play, and there are moments where the actress seems to struggle with what's going on in her character's head, but at other times she does an excellent job.    Amongst the other cast members, Chris Bauer (Frank Sobotka from The Wire) and William Sanderson (the toymaker from Blade Runner) are superb as the town's ineffectual policemen. Ryan Kwanten has a really tough role as Sookie's quite spectacularly stupid brother, who dodges disaster by the skin of his teeth only to get into an even more spectacular mess later on. He just about manages to retain the viewer's sympathy even as the character's life becomes yet another car crash, which is a tribute to the actor. Rutina Wesley plays Sookie's best friend Tara and is rather tiresome to start off with, coming across a bit too much as a hard-assed, don't-need-no-man, all-attitude character but she rapidly becomes one of the show's strongest assets. The scenes where Tara has to confront her mother's alcoholism are superbly well-acted by both parties. Alexander Skarsgard steals every scene he is in as Louisiana's vampire 'sherrif', Eric, especially when paired with Kristin Bauer as his second-in-command, Pam. Lizzy Caplan also needs a nod as psychopathic hippy Amy, who has to combine two very different sides of her character to make a convincing whole and pulls it off. Nelsan Ellis is also excellent as Tara's highly dubious but charismatic cousin Lafayette (who impressively combines the roles of cook, road-digger, drug-dealer and webcam sex actor).    In addition to these characters, there's a vast number of secondary, recurring and guest actors and characters, from Heroes' Zeljko Ivanek as a vampire judge to TNG and BSG actress Michelle Forbes as a very curious new character who appears at the end of the season, and pretty much all of them are great in their roles.    The question of what True Blood is actually about is a difficult one to answer. On the surface, it's a simple murder mystery with vampires, a lot of sex and some quite spectacular gore (especially towards the end of the season). Of course, it's Alan Ball and it's HBO, so it can't be as simple as that. The show initially seems to be contrasting vampires and their struggle for acceptance with gay and black people, which is an interesting idea, if a bit superficial. However, our brief glimpses into the vampire society reveals that the vampires' bigotry and dislike of humans is far more ingrained in them than dislike of vampires is in human society, so the comparison seems to shift of one of a clash of completely incompatible cultures. If even Bill, the 'poster boy for mainstreaming', still does reprehensible and disturbing things, that suggests that the vampires may simply not be that interested in joining real human society. If that is true, that raises the question of what actually is their goal in coming out into the open? It'll be intriguing to see if this is a genuine plot point or simply a background premise that you have to go with and ignore the inconsistencies in order to enjoy the show.    Other issues are also dealt with in a rather puzzling manner, such as Tara's mother's alcoholism. The character blames her alcoholism on a 'demon' living in her soul and, since this is a show about vampires after all, the viewer is unsure whether to dismiss this as an excuse from a woman living in denial of her own failures or if there really is a supernatural element involved. It takes a surprisingly long time for the truth of this plot point to come out into the open, although it's quite clever when it does emerge. Similarly, the odd behaviour of certain characters is highlighted throughout the series, presumably to make us ponder if they could be the serial killer, so that when it is revealed they are not, the 'real' reasons for their odd behaviour don't seem to entirely explain their odd quirks.    On the other hand, the show doesn't seem to entirely take itself too seriously. It also seems to be well aware of the minefield of possible ways it has to offend the viewers, with quite a few black, gay and/or religious characters, and seems to get around the issues by lots of what TV Tropes calls lampshade-hanging (i.e. drawing attention to the issue and almost revelling in it rather than ignoring it). The show also takes what appears to be anovertly anti-Twilight agenda by refusing to have Sookie be rescued out of her predicaments by the various men-folk in her life (probably best-handled in the season finale) and turning her into a proactive character rather than a damsel in distress all the time, which is vital if we are to retain any respect and sympathy for the character.    True Blood's first season (****) is solid, enjoyable fun with some deeper ideas and themes running through it than it first appears. It's slightly trashy and sleazy (although never quite fulfilling the promise of its borderline-sordid title sequence) and on that level won't appeal to all viewers, but it's consistently well-written and superbly-acted, and is well worth a look.
B002INLTXE|5.0|First I have to comment about the interview that comes along as a Bonus.  John Wayne is talking to a group of college kids about something that happened to their Dean.  His point is that back in his day, this sort of thing would have not been tolerated.  Not only by the administration but also by the rest of the student body.  He is telling the men in the audience that they are basically jerks and he is doing it in a VERY SLURRED VOICE!!!  Make your assumption here...VERY FUNNY!!!    Starring as wealthy cattle baron G.W. McLintock, Wayne shows a real sense of comic timing in several scenes filled with slapstick humor.  John Wayne shows off his funny side in this 1963 western, a comedy inspired by THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. After his wife (Maureen O'Hara) and daughter leave him for the East, McLintock attempts to win them back. The dynamics between O'Hara and Wayne are the strong suit of this film, the actors having worked together previously on THE QUIET MAN. As this is by no means a revisionist western, McLintock's chauvinistic attempts to \\"tame\\" his wife fit within the problematic ideology of the larger western genre. The ultimate example of this comes at the end of the film when McLintock settles his marital dispute by publicly \\"spanking\\" his wife in what is now a notorious cinematic moment.

0307386848|5.0|I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again.
0385342020|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is well-known for her easy-to-read-breezes and hilarity throughout the novel -- this exactly what is brought to the table in her new novel Twenties Girl. Lara plays a very familiar role for those familiar with -- Sophie Kinsella novels -- Lara is sincere, resourceful, and a bit naive. The plot is rather far-fetched and a atd silly at times, but we've come to expect that from Ms. Kinsella...and that is what we're fans of - a light-hearted, smooth flowing story, that is fun to read.     Lara and Sadie (the ghost of her aunt) make a great odd couple and compliment each other well. When Lara comes across a hurdle, Sadie is there to add to her difficulties. While this set-up is a perfect setting for humor, they story is more about values, family, friends, honesty, and trust. But what Sophie Kinsella novel would be complete without romance? Well, Ed, fills that role...and with his kind and caring nature, the romance adds to the pleasantry of the novel. In short, Twenties Girl is a fun, light breeze, that all fans Sophie Kinsella will absolutely love. And for those new to the author, I would compare it to JoAnna Wylde's novel: [[ASIN:B002NGO4TW Price of Freedom]] (highly recommend) if you haven't read it yet.
0307155102|5.0|This is an amazing book.  My son is 15 months old and absolutely loves this book -- it is his favorite.  He will sit and \\"read\\" it for a very long time.  He never tires of it.  What is truly amazing is all the little details that they begin to see in it.  My son has learned so many words from reading this book with us.  My husband and I both had this book when we were growing up and marvel at how this has withstood the test-of-time (although admittedly some things are a little dated and there are no computers or cell phones).
0385504225|3.0|To start, I loved The DaVinci Code and don't really have a gripe with the writing style although it is fairly repetitive.  Loved the art history and symbol portions, which are really the reason to read Dan Brown.  Otherwise...    My main problem with the book is that the huge secret that the Masons have been keeping safe for centuries in order to protect Humankind dissipates into nothingness once it's revealed:  It is not actually much of a secret and Humankind wouldn't give a hoot to learn about this so-called \\"secret information\\" anyway. You probably could not pay Humankind to learn or care about this \\"secret\\"!      Also, I figured out the twist pretty early on.  This particular kind of twist requires some very adept writing skill, otherwise the awkwardness of the sentence structures act as a huge clue that things are not as they seem.  The whole fun of twists is that you don't see them coming.  It is not fun when you notice them from the beginning.    So, Dan, please write another book like The DaVinci Code which introduces us to a very intriguing new concept that is hidden in age old symbols.  And forgot this National Treasure retread that goes nowhere.
0439023491|4.0|2nd Installment of The Hunger Games is good but doesn't have shock-value and new-ness which made the first book so exciting.  Catching Fire is has moments of exhilarating fun but it's obvious where the plot is going:  back into the arena! As we find out though, there's a reason everyone returns to the games.  The are \\"chinks in the armor\\" of the Capital! Ending leaves you hanging but isn't that the point?  I throughly enjoyed reading about the main character development of Katniss.  For a 17-year old girl, this is one sharp lady.  While not completely necessary, I highly recommend you read The Hunger Games 1st before diving into Catching Fire.
B00008RH3L|5.0|A strange little film. Once again the Coen Brothers want to make an anti-genre film. This time they attack the genre of the gangster mafia in an eastern city that does not need a name but has to be big during prohibition. That mafia is working in clubs with bars and gambling tables, and in racketeering for protection. Two rival gangs and one chap taken in between Irish and Italian bosses or would-like-to-be-sole bosses. He has an affair with the girl friend of the Irish man and he shifts to the other side but then he is demanded to execute the brother of the woman, which he fakes and then this brother turns against him and he finally manages, after many sessions of punching and upper cutting that leave him every time healthy and strong, to trick and trap the brother who belongs to the Irish gang and the Italian boss into confronting each other at his own place and the brother kills the Italian boss and our man kills the brother and disguises the two deaths in a mutual gun fight and killing. He is back with his first boss the surviving Irish man who is going to marry the woman of before and forgives our man. But this one refuses that forgiveness that he has not asked and walks away. We will note a slight touch of Jewishness on that Irish man for the funeral of the brother. The cops in that prohibition situation are providing the street entertainment and the cleaning sessions in some clubs that are so wide open that a whole brigade of cops could run in without breaking the slightest piece of glass. But the best part remains the machine gun fights between the Irish boss and the hit men sent to assassinate him by the competitor. The chandelier turns into a \\"windmill\\" that is in fact a \\"bullet mill\\" and it is funny though it lasts only a second. Overkill is the motto and so many bullets and noise for just nothing is like using the space shuttle to go buy your daily bread at the next block bakery.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDParis 12 Créteil, CEGID

B001MYIXAW|5.0|While the subtitles in the dvd release are poorly done, the movie itself is a masterpiece. I agree with many...wait until the dvd includes the original theatrical translation...much is lost from the theatrical version, including some of the sweetest moments and most profound.  But if you havent seen do yourself a favor and check it out when the proper version is released.  This is one of the best films I have ever witnessed, an incredibly original story, two amazing performances by the young leads, who exhibit great chemistry, an innocent pure love story between two whose lives are not so great beforehand.  The necessary violence and how they cope with it...and the violence is not glamourized and is well done, and shocking in its realism.  The original score also is the perfect compliment and I would recommend you check that out or purchase it as well....one of the better ones Ive come across.  So this is not Twilight by any stretch....not Hollywoodized nonsense and shallow, superficial romance.  Very highly recommended

0385504225|3.0|Plot Summary:  Robert Langdon's old friend and mentor, Peter Solomon, calls in a favor and asks Robert to give a speech at a charity event being held in the Capitol building.  When Robert arrives, he finds his friend is missing, and a mysterious `invitation' waiting in the Rotunda, one that he must solve if he wants to save Peter.  Someone wants a secret that has been protected by the Freemasons since the beginning of Washington D.C.'s existence, and Robert must choose whether to protect the secret and sacrifice his friend, or reveal what the Masons would take to their graves.    At the end of [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]], I felt like I had been taken on an incredible ride and learned secret revelations that were truly earth-shattering (no matter that it's all make-believe).  I just finished The Lost Symbol, and this time I feel like I was moderately entertained, but the big secret was a big bust.  To make matters worse, I had correctly guessed the `final resting place' of the `treasure,' and I since I usually suck at predicting the outcome of a mystery, this one must be way too simple if I honed in on it within the first chapter or two.    As I read this book, I kept grumbling to myself, asking when the action was gonna start.  I was fairly bored for the first third of this novel, and when Robert Langdon finally got his [...]on the run, it started to get interesting.  Too bad it never matched the intensity and excitement of The Da Vinci Code though.  There are some good spine-tingly torture scenes, but the bad-guy is pretty much invincible throughout, and it's almost an act of God that finally takes him down.  It's a nice vote of confidence from Dan Brown that the entire CIA cannot find a man who doesn't have a hair on his body, and is tattooed from head to toe.  The funny thing is, they seem to have no trouble finding everybody else, just not the 6'3\\" guy who is bulked on steroids and resembles the Sunday comics page.    Okay, I've groused enough about what I didn't like, but this book is far from a complete dud.  The Washington D.C. trivia and history that Dan Brown doles out is absolutely fascinating.  I kept going back to my laptop so I could pull up images of the paintings, statues, and buildings that are mentioned, and yes, I'm itching to visit our nation's capitol now.  The true history of Washington D.C. stole the show, and it makes the lost symbol revelation feel like a complete letdown by comparison.  In this case, the fiction could not compete with the reality.

0385504225|5.0|I think this book is a minor miracle. It is a crackling, \\"just one more chapter\\" thriller that you can't wait to finish but never want to end. That alone is reason enough to read it.     But what makes it miraculous is the way Mr. Brown manages to weave challenging philosophical premises as well as \\"I have got to Google that\\" details and facts into that cotton candy that is the plot.     I have no patience for those those who criticize Mr. Brown's work as \\"pop-academia\\" and \\"low-brow literature.\\" He aims neither to create serious academic treatises nor challenging art. As far as I can tell he is simply trying to tell a rip-roaring story that manages to shock us with information that is hidden right in front of us.     Of course writing that kind of story is anything but simple as the success of The DaVinci Code spawned countless imitators who (as far as I know) never came close to creating the kind of reading experience that Mr. Brown has again managed to do.     It's an absolute blast. Read it.

B000J5XS3C|3.0|This product is well-built and would be quite useful for someone who's just getting started or when budget prohibits shopping for higher-end products.    I am returning the product because I am highly dissatisfied with the tone of the preamp.  I was hoping to put this between myself and an M-Audio Firewire 410 so I wouldn't have to keep resetting levels between bass, guitar, etc.  However, the Firewire 410 preamp sounds so many times better than the preamp in the 802 that I was forced to abort mission.    Fiddling with the Eq made things a little better, but the difference between the 802 and direct is still unbelievable.  Plus, who wants to put a bunch of Eq on an incoming recording signal and have one more thing to mess with trying to get ideas down?    I give the 802 three stars because it seems like a quality product, but would advise more discriminating users to save up and get something with a better preamp.
B000021Y77|5.0|The proof of a good movie is how long it remains in your thoughts. I've thought of Lola Run ever since seeing it for the first time, in 1998. It's my favorite movie in the world. I've watched it at least ten times. It convincingly proves that every action you take creates a ripple effect which affects the whole world. For the past ten years, every time something important happens to me I tell myself, That was a Lola moment. Lola runs past people on the street, and the director shows how her passing affects their lives differently (according to whether it's at 12:00, 12:01, or 12:02) by a quick-pace series of photographs of their lives, after this brief encounter. So owning this movie is a must because you'll want to keep replaying the quick series of photographs which show their possible futures, depending on the time of day she brushes past them. Simply amazing. Brilliant acting and incredible filming. Great music and cartoony special effects. People rave about the Butterfly Effect and Sliding Doors but these two don't come close.

B00005QGAT|5.0|One thing about disco music is that it often prides itself on its style and glitz.  And it's right to do so since modern dance music is almost always about style over substance.  \\"Off The Wall\\" however takes on this whole new persona that has always been quite alien to dance music.  It transcends the norms of the genre in that it comes off as a very serious musical statement.  One reason why is that the songwriting here is simply far stronger than the average disco album released at the time.  Sure there's mostly love songs and partying anthems here but the arrangements are superior and the music is simply way more diverse.  Most disco albums are not going to have lush, string swept ballads like, \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" nor hard hitting stompers like, \\"Get On The Floor\\".      But main reason why this album works so well is not just the music but the fact that it's Michael Jackson as the dance leader here.  Jackson had already built a massive reputation and image from his days in the Jackson Five so his very presence here does wonders for the overall listening experience. No one can imagine anybody else singing such classics as \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\" and \\"Workin' Day And Night\\".  And over the years, \\"Off The Wall\\" has only grown in popularity since the release of such immortal albums as \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\" and the subsequent rise of Jackson's stardom.  So in that respect, this album does have a lot of style like most disco does.  It just has way more of it and a more sophisticated brand than most other 70s disco albums.    Anybody who likes disco music is gonna love this album.  Even some people who hate dance music are probably going to like what's presented here.  Yet another thing that separates this recording from traditional disco is its unity and cohesion.  Sure there are hit single here, but the album speaks on its own accord.  After all, it has the perfect climax: \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" which describes precisely what was happening to disco music whenthe album was released.      Michael has released bigger albums that sold more copies, but nothing he did after this would ever sound like quite like it nor be such a perfect representation of its time.  And there is a big difference between being a representation of your time and being simply an artifact.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|When I bought this CD the day it was released the girl asked me if my kids had enjoyed the last Album I had to say no they didn't but I did .......Although they were the instigators of my Muse addiction I am the one who has grown with the group.As a classically trained musician I fell in love with Bellamys wide angle lens view of music.This young man is a gifted genius and one who although not appealing to the majority of the younger ages has found a loyal following in people who love the big full rich sounds of orchestra and singers.This album to my mind combines some of Black hole and also the other albums that went before.Here is Muse at its best the only one that grated was the queen like tribute .......it was a bit weak.but on the whole I love the big Lush sounds and Bellamys voice .If you want power and individuality this is the album to have.
0385504225|1.0|I will never waste my time again on another Dan Brown novel.<br />The plot is identical to the Da Vinci Code.  Spoiler warning, the final message of the book - all our troubles began when man perceived himself to be separate from God.  That I had to read through 450 pages of code breaking to hear?<br />Its a pyramid, no its a word, no its a map, no its a word, no really, its a map, ok, its a word and a map......
B0026J8LHM|5.0|After a month or so of repeated listens I'm still not tired of this album.  I can't say the same for the past few DT albums.  This one really seems to stick, the songs are catchy without going into the usual instrumental embellishment overkill too, it's nice to see these guys hit a fine balance.    The albums lyrics are focused around the title.  There's a great youtube video of Portnoy explaining it.  I swear DT has some of the worst fans in the business.  Nothing but bellyaching every time an album is released.  They should include pacifiers with the DT logo on them with each cd purchase.     The only rehash here is 'The Shattered Fortress' but there are some really cool ideas going on in the song that I love (that actually would have made a better, new song).  Anyway at least it's not another Muse tribute song.    If you've skipped out on the last few releases I feel that this is one that should not be passed up.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|Well, lets face it. I'm a fan of Deadmau5, but that won't mean I wont critique music well. Ever since Deadmau5 released \\"Random Album Title,\\" I was completely taken aback by his amazing beats and wonderfully catchy tunes.    *FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME DOES NOT DISAPPOINT\\"    I don't think that For Lack Of A Better Name is better than Random Album Title in any means, truly. That album was just way too good, but Lack Of is just one of those albums that will make you dance no matter what you're doing. TTryly, it's like a live DJ set in the palm of your hand.    That being said, I have For Lack Of A Better Name a five because it's that good. My favorite tracks on the album are Ghosts N Stuff, Bot, Word Problems, and Strobe. You also can't forget the amazing Hi Friend, too... Anyway, that's it.

1416594787|5.0|Usually authors will start out their writing careers making a general case on behalf of something, and then later deal with the specific objections as they arise. But not Richard Dawkins. As the leading prolific evolutionary author in our generation he finally got around to writing the book that many authors would've written first, this one. Since up until now he has not set forth the evidence for evolution as a whole, he calls this book \\"my missing link\\" in his chain of books, and it's long overdue.<br /><br />Taking the title from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Dawkins begins by asking us to imagine what it would be like to be a European history teacher who is \\"continually faced with belligerent demands to give equal time\\" in his classes to Holocaust deniers. To him that would be what it's like to teach the scientific fact of evolution around the world, especially in America, where 40% of us deny that humans evolved from other animals and who claim instead we were all created as distinct species not more than 10,000 years ago. Just like the Holocaust deniers these people are \\"history-deniers\\" too. The antidote to that kind of ignorant thinking is this present work, which presents \\"the positive evidence that evolution is a fact\\" (p.6). Many bishops and theologians embrace evolution as a fact, even if some of them accept it begrudgingly.<br /><br />Who is he trying to reach? The creationist \\"history-deniers\\" themselves, but more importantly those who find themselves inadequately prepared to argue the case for evolution (p. 8).<br /><br />He claims: \\"Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eyewitnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips...continue the list as long as desired...It didn't have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it.\\" (pp. 8-9).<br /><br />These are very large claims he's making. Are they justified? Yes, I think so. I challenge the creationists to place this comprehensively argued book, which is illustrated by many diagrams and glossy full colored pictures, next to what a few ancient superstitious people wrote in the Bible and see which one makes the most sense. My bet is that if believers are truly interested in the facts they will see evolution is indeed a fact.<br /><br />Dawkins knows how to communicate, he knows where to begin his case with dog breeding, and he knows science. It's practically all here within the pages of this book. The reason why we don't see evolutionary change is because it takes place slowly over generations, but dog breeders can do it quickly and efficiently. \\"Every breed of dog,\\" Dawkins writes, \\"from dachshund to Dalmatian, from boxer to borzoi, from poodle to Pekinese, from Great Dane to Chihuahua, has been caved, chiseled, kneaded, moulded, not literally as flesh and bone but in its gene pool....The relevance to natural evolution is that, although the selecting agent is man and not nature, the process is otherwise the same.\\" (p. 34).<br /><br />With regard to flowers, birds and insects make these changes rather than humans, naturally, not artificially, just like the wind did before them: \\"Hummingbird eyes, hawk-moth eyes, butterfly eyes, hoverfly eyes, bee eyes are critically cast over wild flowers, generation after generation, shaping them, colouring them, swelling them, patterning and stippling them, in almost exactly the same way as human eyes later did with our garden varieties; and with dogs,cows, cabbages and corn.\\" (p. 52). And he asks us: \\"If so much evolutionary change can be achieved in just a few centuries or even decades, just think what might be achieved in ten or a hundred million years?\\" (p. 37).<br /><br />To believers who object that the earth isn't old enough Dawkins marshals overwhelming evidence that it is billions of years old, along with evidence piled upon still more evidence to show evolutionary development of life on earth is indeed the greatest show on earth, and he is clearly in awe of it.<br /><br />There are a few great books on evolution but this is a superior book long overdue by today's leading communicator of science. You should get it and think through it, especially if you're a \\"history-denier.\\" Face the evidence and then change your beliefs. It's the intellectually honest thing to do. Then you too will thank Dawkins like so many of us have for his writing in these areas.us: \\"If so much evolutionary change can be achieved in just a few centuries or even decades, just think what might be achieved in ten or a hundred million years?\\" (p. 37).

B002BSHWUU|2.0|It is pandering to the loudness craze that, while not explicitly about limiting the dynamic range of every song, in effect the remastering engineers did do some work that results in the distance between the quietest peaks and the loudest sounds being reduced -- reducing the dynamic range of the recording, not making use of the ability to modern digital equipment to capture the full range of what the Beatles originally put on tape and reproduce it accurately, and -- in a few cases -- changing the music (see examples below).<br /><br />But don't take my word for it.  Listen to it yourself, in comparison with the 80s CDs (not ideal but possessing a wider dynamic range).  And Google for interviews with the engineers at EMI that remastered the music for this release.  They indicate without hesitation that they did engage in limiting to increase the overall loudness of the stereo releases, only leaving the mono releases with the full dynamic range of the original recordings.<br /><br />Does that mean the new CDs sound bad?  No, don't think so.  And I am sure some people will like them better than the original recordings.  But it does mean they could sound more accurate.  Is it too much to ask that we hear it the way it was originally intended?  I guess if George Lucas can revise his masterpiece, we cannot expect less of the Beatles.<br /><br />Sure, some people will tell you the compression is minor and get over it.  I guess if it's that minor, it was unnecessary?  Oh wait....  that doesn't make sense, either.  The fact is, the limiting/compression has changed the music.<br /><br />Here are some examples:<br /><br />The piano chord at the end of a A Day in the Life.  The final orchestra bit it louder than the piano chord, on the original LP version, and on the CD from the 80s, and on the mono version of the remasters.  Not so, however, on the stereo remaster.  Maybe it's more dramatic this way, but it's not the way it was composed and recorded.  The limiting (compression)has altered the dynamic range (reduced it) enough to actually change the music.<br /><br />Or John's final \\"yeah\\" on the end of I Want You (She's So Heavy).  Here the compression or limiting has changed the tone and clarity of the vocal.  I guess one could say they like it better, but it's not more accurate to what was recorded.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|Oh the dialogue - the dialogue!  It was like watching an episode of Murder She Wrote.  Why dumb it down?  Season one was great. Season two was good. Season three? Hmmmmm.   I'll remain optimistic about Season four.
0385504225|1.0|A number of reviewers, including that of THE NEW YORK TIMES,  equate rapid page-turning with the mark of a good read.  I disagree - comic book characters like the hero, heroine, supercop, and villain of \\"Symbol\\" become boring with 500 pages of repetition, and despite the sometimes interesting arcana of freemasonry, there is no real plot, just danger followed by escape ad nauseum.  It reminded me of the serials I loved watching at my local movie theatre - when I was 10 years old.
0321525655|2.0|I have bougth that book with a lot of expectations and at the end was a bit disapointed. I had started studying the subject with a first cheaper purchase on the website powerpoint-presentation-[...]. That revealed to be actually enough. The book Presentation Zen did not bring me much more. I think that the book could have been shorter, and some ideas were sometimes too obvious.. (like keep the light on)

0385504225|3.0|Pager turner until about 80%. Loved the plot, suspense. After a shocker (which I loved) the story took a nose dive. Re-hashing all the conversations about Ancient Mysteries that took place earlier in the book. Very preachy about this theme at the end and I had really had enough. Felt like running a long, boring marathon to get to the end with no real worth to show for it. The story could have ended shortly after the twist...Worth borrowing, don't feel obligated to finish the story...there's nothing really worth the wait at the end. Much ado about nothing.
1440469563|4.0|This is the first full-length novel that Austen wrote, and - although it's easy to find proof for something you know is true - it shows. This book just wasn't as well-designed as Pride and Prejudice, where it feels like every character and scene has its purpose. But the characters and charming and the story is light and fun, and it's definitely worth the read.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|Sounds as lively and fresh as the day it was first released.  This is one album that shines after remastering. Recommended.
0143038095|3.0|This book and The Kitchen God's Wife, also by Ms. Tan, are very similar in terms of theme and mood. There were multiple generations of women, each of whom didn't entirely understand the struggles the other went through. This was an interesting study of how we can interact with and communicate with another person, without ever understanding them completely.
B000H5TVKI|3.0|This comment is for the Blu-ray copy. I was hoping for more from the audio/video presentation. The image at the very beginning is awful, but it soon shapes up to be mostly pleasing as long as I lower the black level and up the contrast on my calibrated display. The sound is an improvement over the DVD, but not by much. At least I can hear the dialogue clearly now, but the sound effects of the guns and explosions and thunder could have been updated. With the filmmakers still being alive, I would think that they'd be interested in advancing the presentation by updating the sound design a bit. I know if I had made this film and I had newer and better resources at my disposal today, I would certainly take advantage of the current technology and up the ante on this baby. An extreme, but perfect example is the recent Criterion release of Chungking Express. What Wong Kar Wai did was take a lackluster mono sound design and create an entirely new soundfield mix that really elevates the viewing experience. It's important to enhance the viewing experience when possible, especially since the way we watch films today has changed so drastically from the days of VHS, and I've no doubt that it will continue to advance in ways we may not envision at this time. There is no harm in giving films like this a boost, as long as it doesn't stray from the original intent of the sound's design.    Considering how cheap this film is on blu-ray, I would say it is worth the dough.
0307456625|5.0|I don't normally like mysteries, because I hate blood and gore and suspense. But I have to say that this book was really charming. Although it has 'detective' in the title, the mysteries are not the central theme of this book at all. This is a book about the main character and about her country - the mysteries she handles are supporting plots, and they are not bloody or gory. I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in this series.
0375413405|5.0|I'm not sure why I always thought French cooking would be a hard and mysterious thing. With this book, it's not. The descriptions given are clear and there are illustrations to help.<br /><br />Thus far I have made four of the recipes in the Soups chapter and have been very pleased. The whole family also ate them which is the deal clincher for me. THe best part is that the ingredients are easy to find and not out of this world expensive. I can't wait to make some of the sauces and egg dishes next.
0451450523|3.0|I guess this is a \\"well-loved fantasy book\\" and has also been made into a movie, but I don't think I'd read or seen it before. It was an interesting and relatively charming story, but it didn't touch me, make me think deeply, or teach me anything.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Black Book is a very, very powerful movie on Nazis occupation.  The script combines multiple historic episodes in a more limited cast of players.  The suspense is constant.  Blood, [...] and humor are combined to describe life during the Nazis occupation of Holland.  The movie was written by the Dutch and they hold nothing back.    Entertaining but also disturbing. It does not support trusting your neighbor.
0156027321|3.0|I found this book very engaging and interesting. I didn't read the back of the book before I read it, and to be honest, I didn't even really look at the cover, and I'm glad. The book is about Pi, a sixteen-year old boy from India who has come to accept three different religions: Islam, Hinduism, and Catholicism. His family owns a zoo, but they decide to move to Canada, and they board a large cargo ship with most of the animals from the zoo. One thing leads to another, and Pi is left alone on a lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a Bengal tiger. It's true that there's a lot of discussion of killing fish, as some of the negative reviewers said, but I think that's a pretty large portion of your life when you're on a lifeboat. I was frustrated that the religion part seemed like such a large portion of the beginning of the book and wasn't really mentioned afterwards. Not the best book I've ever read, but I enjoyed it.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|A collection of beautifully written, beautifully sung compositions.  Paolo Nutini is a truly gifted artist and I pity the fools that haven't discovered him yet.  \\"These Streets\\" is his first album recorded at the tender age of 19.  But the emotional intensity and soul of this performer is way beyond his years. Paolo has the true gift of conveying emotion through song.    One of my favorite tracks is \\"Autumn\\" which is a tribute to his grandfather (his first musical influence).  Another is Alloway Grove, which has two distinct parts..One tells a story of returning home to find the girl he has been pining for only to find she's no longer there...sounds sad but it's actually kind of upbeat...the second part is lesser known but has a sweet gentle sadness and talks about having to let go of a place in order to move on (that's the best way I can describe it).  The title track \\"These Streets\\"  is my favorite.  If you've ever felt lost in a strange place..this song tells it.  White Lies shows an insight that is hard to comprehend in a 19 year old male, but we're not talking about an ordinary mortal here.    Just buy it.  There's not a bad track on this CD.
1400032717|4.0|This book was so strange and interesting and weird and different. I'm a big fan of innovation in books and movies, and this Haddon has succeeded in writing a book that's very different from any that I've read before. The book is written in first person and the protagonist is autistic, although he doesn't ever describe himself using that word. I was so impressed by the way that Haddon describes the protagonist's thought processes - it makes the autistic behavior that we consider strange (hitting, screaming, curling up in a ball) seem reasonable and sensible.

I found the story interesting, but I found the language to be overly flowery. I'm also really not a poetry person, and since the book is about the romance between two poets, there is a lot of poetry in it.

1589944607|5.0|I have to admit this game escaped my notice completely, at first.  During the airing of the last 10 episodes of Season Four earlier this winter/spring, SciFi channel was hawking the wares at their online shop, and one of those was Battlestar Galactica, The Board Game.  What can I say?  Considering that most movie/TV series tie-in board games have been, to be extremely gentle, less than stellar, I laughed at it.  Until I found out it was made by Fantasy Flight Games, a well respected maker of strategy games, and that it was highly reviewed on [...].  So, as a fan of the TV series, I gave it the proverbial plunge, and I was extremely glad that I did.    Battlestar Galactica is a game for 3-6 players.  Each player plays one of ten of the television show's main characters (Commander Adama, Roslin, Tigh, Lee Adama, Starbuck, Sharon \\"Boomer Valerii, Galen Tyrol, Baltar, etc).  The physical components consist of the Battlestar in a field of stars and a map of Colonial One, and several dials to track the various resources.  Depending on the situation, ships are deployed to zones marked in the starfield.    Frankly, the game gets better with the more players there are.  If you've seen the SciFi series, you'll have a pretty good idea what the general feel of the game is, if not, the Cylons, most of them anyways, are just about indistinguishable from humans, which leads to one of the game's greatest schticks.    The goal of the basic game is simple.  Survive, and keep the fleet alive long enough to reach the planet Kobol and make one more jump to win the game.  But that's the trick isn't it.  You and some of your players (notice the use of the word \\"some\\") have to manage dwindling resources, survive crises, survive attacks by the Cylon fleet, and keep Galactica battle-worthy enough to make the needed series of jumps.  And if that was all there is to the game, it'd be a neat little strategy game, but it wouldn't be nearly the puzzler and great game that it is.    At two times during the game, before games beginning, and at roughly the midpoint, each player draws a card from the Loyalty Deck.  Depending on the number of players, the majority of the cards will tell the player he's not a Cylon, but there are cards that will tell 1-2 players that he is a Cylon, and possibly a Sympathizer.  Their goals is to undermine the Humans.  From within, if possible, from without, as necessary.  And in a thousand ways.  Needless to say, the other players won't know for certain who that player is.  And that's where the real fun of the game begins.  Even if the Cylon is discovered, he can work to sabotage the humans.  A creative Cylon player can cause absolute chaos for the humans, and much of the game is trying to figure out who is sabotaging the humans.    It's a great, great game, and well worth the money.  I can't recommend it highly enough.    Battlestar Galactica  3-6 Players  Playing Time: 2-3 hours for experienced players.  Tack on 1 more hour if you're learning the rules as you go.  Physical Components (including board): 5 of 5 (Fantasy Flight always makes excellent components for their games).  Game Balance, Design: 5 of 5 (A tense, taut thriller throughout).  Gameplay: 5 of 5  Rules: 5 of 5 (Simple, easy to understand rules)  Overall: 5 of 5.  (Buy it, you won't be disappointed).    Also check out the Pegasus Expansion for this game, which comes out at the end of September, for more fun with this one.

0385504225|3.0|The book really is a page turner. There is a good bit of action, mystery and suspense. The history and symbolism of the Mason's is really interesting. The big annoyance was Brown's interjections that seem to have the goal of making Christians feel stupid for being a Christian. He uses language meant to sound like fact to explain away the tenants of the Christian faith, as if it is really all just one big conspiracy to control people. Meanwhile he calls people like the renown Satanist Aliester Crowley as simply being \\"misunderstood\\". Most of these sometimes page long tangents have absolutely squat to do with the actual story and it gets annoying quickly. All in all it is a decent book, just take the side notes with a grain of salt.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|The album Thriller by Michael Jackson is simply amazing. I wasn't born until 1990, so when this album first came out I hadn't been born.But I've always loved the video for Thriller and I've always been a fan of Michael Jackson. After listening to this album I can now see why it is the best selling album of all time.I love every single song on the cd. Usually when I buy a cd there is always at least 2 or 3 songs on it that I don't like. But this album is different, I really love each and every song up here. Michael Jackson was truly amazing and it's because of this album and just his music in general that his legacy will never die.
0385736002|5.0|This is an excellent book, but you should realize that this is not a Harry Potter clone. While it is aimed more at a teenager reader, it was still very interesting and intriguing to me (I'm a few years past my teens...OK, more than a few years). I think there are enough descriptions of the plot line already, so I'm going to stick with what I liked about the book. The characters seem so real and normal (with the obvious exception of some of them being deities and/or several hundreds of years old). The two main characters of the book, Sophie and Josh, seem to be pretty normal teenagers. They get involved in a situation that is unbelievable to them and they seem to show the normal amount of \\"are you kidding me\\" emotions. The descriptions of where they are and what is happening (is that called imagery?) are very well written and completely bring the reader into the story. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I love this cd so much. I especially love \\"Man in the Mirror\\", \\"Bad\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\". Something else that I also like is the booklet with the lyrics. The pictures included in the booklet are incredible and it makes me miss Michael Jackson that much more.The extra tracks and interveiws with Quincy Jones at the end are amazing. I would definitley recommend this to any Michael Jackson fan.

B00005QGAV|5.0|I really can't even begin to find the words to describe this album. It's a mix of good hard-hitting songs, a few songs that make you want to get up and dance, and my favorite, the songs like \\"Heal the World\\" and \\"Will You be There\\" that show a softer side of Michael, these songs show that he truly did care about the world and the people in it. Some people don't think that this side of Michael is serious, but you can tell that he was genuine and really concered about what was going on in the world. The booklet that is included with this cd is great. The pictures are wonderful and I always love it when the lyrics are included. I think that this is one of the best albums of all time and true Michael Jackson fans should definitley have it.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|\\"Mr. Sulu, Impulse power.\\"<br /><br />I thought this might help, as there is very little info from Amazon on this product. This review is mostly for the content of this STANDARD DEFINITION 7 Disc ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE COLLECTION Box Set released Sept. 22, 2009.<br /><br />Obviously, these are the 6 Original Paramount films with the Original Series cast.<br /><br />STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE<br />THE WRATH OF KHAN<br />THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK<br />THE VOYAGE HOME<br />THE FINAL FRONTIER<br />and THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY<br /><br />Every film in this set is the Original Widescreen Theatrical Version. The 7th Bonus Disc is THE CAPTAINS' SUMMIT. A 70 minute round table discussion with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, and host Whoopi Goldberg.<br /><br />Each Movie Disc includes commentaries, a few short Special Features, and NO theatrical trailers. The Insert Card states: 2 1/2 hours of Special Features. My guess is that they're leftovers from the previous 2 Disc Editions for each film, none of which I've ever owned. So, don't take my word for it. (Anyone that thinks 5 Stars may be too generous for this Edition, I only really care about the films. And, the way they look and sound. SFs are of secondary concern to me.)<br /><br />Sound for all the films is 5.1 Dolby Digital EX and maintains a good presence. There is NO 2.1 or DTS setting. As usual with big studio blockbusters, music is too far forward in the mix for my taste, and dialogue is at a lower volume.

B002KLAL4W|4.0|\\"Backspacer\\" was always going to be a difficult album for Pearl Jam to make.  Not only was it following up 2006's self-titled effort-- the group's most vivid and satisfying post-\\"Vitalogy\\" studio album-- but it was also coming off of a period when frontman Eddie Vedder seemingly leaned toward becoming a solo artist.  Vedder composed 2007's respectable soundtrack for \\"Into the Wild,\\" embarked on a series of solo tours, and contributed almost nothing to the press surrounding the re-release of Pearl Jam's classic \\"Ten\\" album earlier this year.  Thus, the fact that the band spends much of \\"Backspacer\\" acting on cruise control is perhaps not surprising.  After thirteen continuous years of Pearl Jam never making the same album twice-- indeed, sometimes shocking fans with their experimentation-- I can't help but feel a little disappointed that \\"Backspacer\\" essentially has the same structure as \\"Pearl Jam\\" (in this sense, it's similar to the Stone Temple Pilots' final album \\"Shangri La-Dee Da\\").  Nonetheless, a band that has delivered as consistently as Pearl Jam has perhaps earned the right to operate on cruising mode, especially considering that it took them 18 years to reach this point and \\"Backspacer\\" is still a very good album.    There's certainly no arguing with the album's first four tracks, which set up a \\"party mood\\" for \\"Backspacer\\" which is both unprecedented for Pearl Jam and refreshing.  I at first didn't like the first single \\"Fixxer,\\" yet it works in the context of being part of this album's partying first third.  \\"Gonna See My Friend\\" and \\"Got Some\\" are especially kick-ass openers, rockers on par with all of Pearl Jam's best anthems.  Like \\"Pearl Jam,\\" \\"Backspacer\\" mellows out a bit after its rousing opening, although there are still rockers scattered throughout.  \\"Just Breathe\\" was too sappy for my tastes, although it does have a nice \\"Into the Wild\\"-esque groove.  \\"Amongst the Waves\\" is a great mid-tempo rocker which celebrates Eddie Vedder's love of theocean, a longtime theme in Pearl Jam's music.  \\"Supersonic\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" bring some much-need energy to the album's final third.  And the closer \\"The End\\" ranks as one of the best ballads Pearl Jam's ever done; besides, I've always been partial to Pearl Jam closing albums with ballads.    Overall \\"Backspacer\\" feels like yet another journey with old friends, only this time it's a fun one rather than a philosophical one (\\"Binaural,\\" \\"Riot Act\\") or a politically charged one (\\"Pearl Jam\\").  Pearl Jam has spend much of the second half of the 00's emerging from the depths of their self-imposed mainstream exile.  As much as we hardcore fans love \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" (and I'm especially a fan of \\"Riot Act\\"), those were albums that only a hardcore fan could love, and they were essentially ignored by the mainstream.  If \\"Backspacer\\" expands Pearl Jam's fan base without sacrificing the reasons why we all came to love the group in the first place, then all power to it.
B002KVSJ7S|5.0|I literally fell upon MIKA one day while surfing the internet about a year back looking for; of all artists; The Scissor Sisters, and saw the video for \\"Grace Kelly\\" by someone named MIKA on the sidebar.  I was instantly intrigued and so...I clicked. Thank God I did, for if I hadn't I may not have discovered the pure joy of his amazing music.      MIKA's music brings a simplicity, child likeness, yet undeniable depth with it.  His songs aren't just extremely catchy or poppy, but are so full of depth, with most telling a little story of some sort.  It's great to have this in a world of shallow pop/rock and rap crap music.      His sophomore album, \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\", builds on the same fantastic childlike sounds and concepts of his first album \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\". He starts off with a wonderful teen anthem aptly titled \\"We Are Golden\\", a cry for acceptance by peers and adults alike. He then gives us a wonderfully addictive little ditty called, \\"Blame It On The Girls\\", followed by \\"Rain\\", which I LOVE!!! A song about hating the rainy days and longing for the sun.  \\"Dr. John\\" I'm not quite sure about yet.    Then we come to what I believe MIKA to be the BEST at, and that is his ballads.  \\"I See You\\", is a hauntingly beautiful song about, feeling invisible in relationships.  His classic training in piano comes into full swing here as he shows us just how dang good he is on those slick ivory keys.      \\"Blue Eyes\\" is a fantastic song with a wonderful almost reggae type tune to it. And \\"Good Gone Girl\\" is a sad story wrapped in a fun sounding sticky sweet pop song.  At the half way point we get to my three favorite songs.  First, is the George Michaelesque \\"Touches You\\" which has such an addictive chorus you'll be repeating it over and over again in the car.  'I wanna be your brother, wanna be your father too; won't let you run for cover even if they want us to. I wanna be your sister, wanna be your mother too, I wanna be, wanna be whatever else that touchesyou.' After that is my FAVORITE song on the album, \\"By The Time\\", such a sad and emotional ballad put into such a mellow and relaxing song. 'Don't wake up, won't wake up, can't wake up, no...don't wake me up'. The song is so beautiful and the lyrics tells such a sad yet well known story in today's age. Then lastly, \\"One Foot Boy\\" is very different from anything MIKA has done previously.  His pop has always been straight up pop, but this song has such a heavy almost hip/hop groove flair to it, yet it works so well.    \\"Toy Boy\\" takes the album into a very different direction up to the end.  Giving the album more of a jazzy/blues flavor, with MIKA's ever presence funny coups and puns thrown in. \\"Pick Up Off The Floor\\", is a fantastic blues ballad and a sad story as well. \\"Lover Boy\\" and \\"Lady Jane\\" wrap up the album with more clever depth and quirkiness. \\"Lady Jane\\" being a strange; and I do mean STRANGE song, about a girl who falls for a man and ends up mutilating herself and becoming a fish...yeah...a fish...but for MIKA, it works.    MIKA's voice, I could only describe as a male version of Mariah Carey.  He is able to hit very low registers but is best know for hit a very high tenor, or is it high alto for guys, I'm not sure.  He has a beautiful voice and a fantastic ability at writing.  His cleverness and originality is undeniable and if he ever decided NOT to do music I'm sure he could have a career as a children's author.      Pick up both albums since they are both shining examples of what MAINSTREAM music could be, if people could put their clothes on and focus on the music and not the nudity, profanity or oneupmanship that has become today's music industry.  \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" is definitely worth being in your collection.    Best songs:  \\"Touches You\\"  \\"By The Time\\"  \\"One Foot Boy\\"  \\"Pick Up Off The Floor\\"  \\"Rain\\"
B001FOPODS|4.0|Downside: as observed in some one star reviews, this version scrimps on Prokofiev's music, which is odd, because the music is so ingenious, characterful, humorous, and charming. The rest is all upside: each of those adjectives also applies to the visual and story-book aspects of this Suzie Templeton version of Peter and the Wolf - and even if the fates of the duck and the wolf come out a little differently I couldn't bring myself to become Upset about it - but just enjoyed the \\"alternate ending\\". This movie made me laugh, but adults need to step back and try to view a little movie such as this from a child's perspective. Suzie Templeton has created an entertainment and a narrative that is deep and involving for a child. It stimulates their creativity, and involves them emotionally. It sensitively deals with a reality that is hopefully more brutal than what most of our children are experiencing, and shows a child overcoming adversity. Its only a million times better to have your child watch this than \\"Power Rangers\\" and occasionally children do need to take a few minutes break from videogames. If you think Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Henson's Mirrormask are great (although made with very different techniques), then you will probably also like Peter and the Wolf. Children's movies that are good for their little sould are too few and far between. On the musical side, I suggest you find the Alec Guinness - narrated CD with the Boston Pops, but there are many fine versions.
0765356139|1.0|Ok, so Vin, dominated by feelings of uselessness because she can't protect the people she cares about, decided to go in and butcher an enemy king and most of his guards.  She kills a few hundred of the guards, but leaves the king alive due to a sudden stab of remorse.  The king in turn leaves the city, which in turn destroys the careful balance of power that had been necessary to keep that city from being conquered by a second enemy king.    And Elend's response to this?    \\"Well, I'm sure she had a perfectly good reason, because I trust her absolutely and unquestioningly.\\"    And that's pretty much all you need to know about the Well of Ascension.    Well, that, and Sanderson seems to have a fondness for juvenile \\"good boy/bad boy\\" quandries that really aren't quandries at all.    Oh, and the fact that, when you discover that there's a spy in your highest councils, you shouldn't bother thinking or doing anything about it for over 200 pages.  That way, it's a shock when his identity is discovered.    Awful book.  Far worse than Hero of Ages...at least that one didn't read like a bad teen love story.
B002C39TTG|5.0|I've listened to this album countless times, but always on compact disc as it was originally pressed, so it's a real treat to hear a high quality vinyl remaster. The packaging is top notch, with a nice heavy sleeve. The 180g vinyl record is enclosed in an anti-static sleeve and a 100% replica of the original liner notes is also included.    The benefits of the remaster are heard instantly on Reel Around the Fountain and are also a total joy on the lulling strums of \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\". The rest of the album sounds equally brilliant. My system is no audiophile setup, but the improvement in the sound of this record is obvious.    The omission of \\"This Charming Man\\" may annoy some, but honestly, it's already been remastered on the last singles comp, was reissued on vinyl as a 12\\" single in the 90's, and... well, I really wouldn't expect it to be on this UK import since it didn't appear on the UK version of the album. However, if Rhino plans to release these excellent remasters on CD, I'd love to see a complete US version.
0765350386|4.0|Better than mediocre, since the magic system is pretty original and the world building is good.  And Sanderson uses words very well.    But overall...eh.  The characters are bit one dimensional, and he spends a bit too much time on the emotional development of some of them, and not enough on the plot the crew is running.
B001HN697M|4.0|To fans of the Underworld series this is a must-have. A decent movie in its own right. My only real complaint would be that it's not long enough.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I read all the other reviews with lots of details and insights. They were great!    Originally, I was NOT going to watch this movie - it seemed hokey from the previews.  It happened to be on HBO.  I watched it.  I'm HOOKED!!!!    I loved each and every bit of it!    I memorized dialog (\\"Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift - that is why it is called the 'present'.\\")    I sing the song (a re-make of the classic \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" with Jack Black chiming in in the background).    I glance the online TV guide to see when it is on HBO or Cinemax.    It was only AFTER I watched it for the first time that I realized that one of the Directors (Mark Osborne) is the brother of one of my classmates from high school (Kent Osborne - who also adds voice talent to the movie). How cool is that?! Someone I actually knew created one of my more favorite movies!!    What I TRULY appreciate about this movie is that it didn't try to be \\"politically correct\\" in the portrayal of the lives of the villagers. I really felt like I was NOT being \\"talked at\\" during this movie.     What am I trying to say, here?     It felt like if I could visit this 'place' in real life, that it would look and function exactly like it does in this film. Like nothing was FAKE. Almost like I was actually GLIMPSING a \\"real\\" moment in time.    This DVD sits proudly on our DVD shelf, but has no dust on the cover. It is watched over and over again.    I can't wait for a sequel ... ! (yay!)    And if either of the Osborne's are reading ... THANK YOU! (from a HCHS alum!)
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I can't help but find this entertaining. Mars Attacks! is a silly satire on all those sci-fi films that were made back in the 50's and 60's. There are literally tons of references that it's probably best not to keep track, cause you'll lose count. This may not be Burton's best, but it's certainly his funniest since Beetlejuice. There are some hysterical moments, mostly involving scientists, government officials, and rednecks. The only problem I had with this film was that the cast was too big: some characters were very useless and not very developed, and are killed off too soon. But other than that, I found this to be a very amusing sci-fi parody. I especially like Nicholson, Benning, and Brown for their memorable performances. So if you're into some satire and some sci-fi silliness, then you'll probably enjoy Mars Attacks! from the opening credits to the end credits.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|I am a long time fan of Zombie movies. From the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later and Zombie Honeymoon. I was very excited to see this and not only did it live up to all my expectations but it FAR surpassed them!!!<br /><br />The story is standard fare for a zombie movie. Several survivors meet up as the movie goes on and band together to survive and bond. The thing that makes this movie fun and unique is the WAY it is all pulled off and put together. There are easily TWO break out characters in the movie. Both by two top name actors. The first was Woody Harrelson's character of Tallahassee, The \\"bad-ass tough guy\\". Not only does he kick so much ass in the movie but he is fun and funny and loving. The big surprise you find out about him near the end of the movie , which i won't spoil here, makes you love him. The second one... SPOILER SPOILER Is the short lived character played by Bill Murray....as himself!!! Not only was it EXCITING to see him in it. But every little scene he is in... is stand up and memorable.... even when he's a dead corpse!<br /><br />If you love or like or even slightly enjoy horror or zombie movies... i FULLY recommend you see this movie! it has all the scare and gore you could want and also lots of great characters and laughs.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Okay, so it's true that Blade Runner has a very slow pace. But to be honest, I'd rather have that than a swift, explosive, over-the-top adventure that's mixed with George Lucas and John Woo. This is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. The main reason why it's so great is the awe-inspiring style of the entire film. This is futuristic Los Angeles at its filthiest. There's smoke everywhere, the streets are always wet and dirty, and the hovering vehicles with searchlights would be a constant irritation if you're living on the top floor of an apartment building. But that's not the only thing that makes this film a magical experience. You also have Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" as an adaptation. The screenplay is drastically different than the original story, but at least the inspiriation is still there. Also, you have some incredible performances from Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, and James Edward Olmos. It's a very disturbing environment, so you can see that their characters are clearly affected by it. But Hauer could have at least been given an Oscar nomination; his performance here is probably the standout. His monologues give chills and tears. And this film has an actual message that involves the future, technology, and society in general. If you haven't seen this film yet, I won't spoil the message for you.<br /><br />You can call it slow, and you can call it boring. I love it for what it is: a sci-fi noir masterpiece that's thankfully devoid of mindless action and loud techno music.
0765350386|4.0|ELANTRIS was a great book.  So I was a bit shocked and even disappointed at the sense of Deja Vu I got when I started reading MISTBORN. A few similarities between the two (no spoilers):  --Both feature worlds where everything is covered in some dark substance.  --In both books, a book is translated, aiding the protagonists.   --Both feature a unique magic system.  --Both feature political intrigue mixed with religion.  --Both feature a strong female character in a leading role.    Some reviews say the book picks up after about a 100 pages, but for me I'd say it takes a good half of its 600 pages for it to really build up steam.   For example, there are two chapters that are almost solely dedicated to an explanation of Sanderson's original but confusing magic system. The first is Chapter 7 and the second is in Chapter 20. I certainly don't mind reading about unique magic systems, but when it's explained in a level of detail that even most role-playing games don't go into, you know it's a bit much. Indeed, with the level of detail Sanderson put into his magic system, it would not be hard at all to make this series of books into a video game series.     Those looking for huge battles and lots of action might be disappointed.   Might.  Ironically, I found that the ballroom scenes with Vin and Elend were the most entertaining. It is also refreshing to read about characters who aren't trying to see how fast they can fall in love or get laid.   As mentioned before, Sanderson likes to add a tablespoon of religion to his novels and I was very interested in Vin's talk with Sazed on the topics of faith and belief towards the start of Chapter 35.   Finally, the plot twists at the end and the integration of the quotes at the beginning of each Chapter were very well done.     This novel is best described as a semi-truck. It can take a looooooong time building up speed, but once it does, there is no stopping it. The last hundred pages of the book were excellent payback for all theslow parts and magical explanations that went on before. Although this book is part of a series, one CAN read it as a stand-alone, since Sanderson ties up the loose ends very well. That being said, after I had finished the last page I didn't want this book to be a stand-alone . . . I wanted a sequel, and thankfully, there is one!
B00005JPCF|2.0|So now we're having a deeper fascination with penguins. They're adorable, but this supposed trend is getting overrated. We've got animated films that contain talking penguins (no surprise there). We've got Surf's Up, Madagascar 1 & 2, and now this. Here we have Happy Feet, which is obviously a CGI family film. But what's wrong with it? Well, I can think of a few. First, it's very anti-religious. I'm an agnostic, and I found the overall message to the second half of the movie very insulting. It's like one of those worthless hypocritical messages that you see on The Church Channel; this is just as bad. Second, the songs are very out of place. Many of the songs contain sexual innuendo. I don't care what kids do (they can do whatever they want), but don't you think that this is a bit too much? And lastly, these penguins are so ANNOYING! Everything about them, from their voices to their dancing, is always on the top level of annoyance. But hey, this is still a family feature, and we all love dancing penguins, don't we?<br /><br />But there is still a plus side for Happy Feet. The animation is really impressive: Antarctica really looks beautiful here. But that's the only good thing about this family film. If you have kids, then watch it with them. You'll have a good time. Otherwise, try to avoid its anti-religious message, and its seemingly nonstop cuteness.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|It was as others have said: bland in comparison to his other works. There were in face entirely too many chapters that we didn't even need to have. Mostly it was predictable, I solved the riddle a few chapters in and was fairly certain that I knew the identity of the villain right away too.<br /><br />I'm glad that I only paid Kindle price for it.
B002LE6XR2|5.0|You may have seen the movie and loved, or you may hate Disney for some strange reason, or you may even make light (no pun intended) of the whole Luxo copyright deal. Great, there's nothing wrong with that, but do not talk about that in a REVIEW. I know, this is somewhat hypocritical, but I'm saying this here to stop it. Don't skew and mess up the score of a product just because you don't like the way Disney does things.    If you have such complaints, which happen to be almost entirely unrelated to the film, then discuss them in the discussion board. That's why the board is there.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Buy this DVD.  Pour yourself a neat Scotch, maybe light up in spite of it all, one last cigarette, and imagine yourself in a tower of song, in a dark, though better world.  Smile back as Cohen thanks you for the effort you took to be here.  Cohen's lyrics and music transcend what is petty, what is unanswerable, that which does not speak to love.  And you can hum all this well past closing time.  That said, whoever did the video should never be allowed to edit another film.  It is awful; out of focus, garish purple and blues, repetitive angles, great closeups of nostrils, and only an occasional shot of the magic that Cohen pulls with his hat.  Buy this DVD anyway, it's a 5 star because of the words, music,and the grace of a truly great musician.  Listen to it. Live it. Allow yourself to get hooked.  Hallelujah!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Great purchase. Totally worth every penny. I'm an avid dexter fan and have already watched the entire series 4 times. My girlfriend liked the special bonus 2 episodes of the united states of tara included in the extra bonus disc.

0061719544|5.0|...the funniest, most entertaining and by far the most appealing of all these guys (Letterman & Leno included)--maybe of all the guys I've ever encountered in real life--shines through every page of this unputdownable, occasionally harrowing, tenderly hilarious memoir.  It's all here: Ferguson's playful wit, his utter lack of pomposity, his willingness to laugh at his own farty (as he might put it) humanity along with everyone else's, and his endearingly chivalrous streak apparent even when he's at the abyss of bad behavior (which he captures in all its rawness). If you're not a fan yet, you will be.  So buy the book and change your bedtime...or at least set your TIVO.  In this case, Scotland's loss is most definitely America's gain.
B0028O34SG|4.0|First let me suggest you also see the reviews under the standard-DVD release of this production.<br /><br />While it is impossible to say what is the greatest opera ever, \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\" has to be in the running (critical consensus tends to favor \\"Don Giovanni\\" as Mozart's greatest, but I'm not so sure about that). In any case \\"Le Nozze\\" is hallowed ground for me. It begins with an overture that is a miracle of conciseness, quickly launching us into three hours in which each tuneful delight chases on the heels of another, a virtual non-stop fest of one hit after another! Of course it is a comedy, but it is so much more than that--almost an encyclopedia of human nature at its best and worst, and Mozart's music is the force that drives home all the joy and pathos that mere words and acting cannot; thus the music is so central that one must seek out the best performance possible, not because Mozart's music needs it--it can fairly well survive even indifferent renditions, but because it deserves the best. This means that the musical performance has to take precedence over everything.<br /><br />In search of the best with which to stock my video opera library I have acquired three different DVDs of this opera. Of those three, this is neither the best nor the worst (avoid the 1973 Glyndebourne Festival Opera production [[ASIN:B0002JYAG4 Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro / Te Kanawa, Cotrubas, von Stade, Luxon, Skram, Fryatt; Pritchard, Glyndebourne Opera]], which, in spite of its good reviews and all-star cast, is saddled with audio that I found simply unacceptable). The best was Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1977 movie [[ASIN:B0007P0LNO Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro)]], not a live production on an operatic stage. I knew that there was something missing musically in the other two, and so I felt that I should delve into my library of old videotapes in search of an excellent stage version to serve as a standard of comparison. I found the Met's storied 1985 production, also by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle with Kathleen Battle, James Levine, Carol Van Ness, Ruggiero Raimondi, Thomas Allen, and Frederica von Stade. I also should note that von Stade appears in the same role in that audio-challenged 1973 Glyndebourne Festival Opera production.<br /><br />At the risk of prejudicing you against almost all other performances, I recommend your hearing the Met's production, which you can do on their Website; alas, it is unavailable for purchase as a DVD or VHS, as far as I am able to determine. I was a little surprised to discover that Levine had not yet honed the Met orchestra into one of the best orchestras in the world (although it was probably the best of all pit orchestras). The singing, however, is the best I heard of all the versions to which I listened, and the audio, while not great, was better than the 1973 Glyndebourne Festival Opera DVD. It is important to spell out in what way they are so good and how they differ from the less successful singers in this recent Covent Garden production. It comes down to these qualities: intensity, strength, fluidity, breath control, and creaminess of voice in addition to all the usual prerequisites of accuracy, quality of vibrato, and timing, to name a few. The women in the 1985 Met production, as well as in the 1977 Ponnelle movie were simply better in each of those aspects than those of this recent Covent Garden production. On the bright side, however, the men of this Covent Garden production are roughly equal to their Met Opera and Ponnelle movie counterparts, and I prefer Erwin Schrott's portrayal of Figaro to that of Raimondi, who seemed a tad menacing at times, even though his singing was certainly both agreeable and formidable. Ultimately the choice between these two Figaros (if DVDs of both were available) is a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />Now for some more specifics: Except for a supercharged contribution by the tympani, the orchestra proved itself lackluster in the overture.Throughout the opera, however, the pacing was very good. There was a slight hint of historically informed \\"authentic\\" period performance, which I didn't find helpful, but not objectionable either. Along the same lines, I thought the ornamentation in Rinat Shaham's \\"Voi che sapete\\" was interesting and in good taste.<br /><br />Miah Persson's (Susanna) voice lacked sweetness. Erwin Schrott was a handsome Figaro, and both were entirely credible as young lovers. Schrott has a strong, rich baritone, with excellent intonation and control. Both Persson and Shaham needed to have had more sostenuto to avoid choppiness. Gerald Finley was excellent as the Count; and Dorothea R&ouml;schmann was very good as the Countess; their duets proved the most satisfying of the production. The Countess was just a little disappointing in \\"Dove sono,\\" however. I could see that the intent was to stay in tempo, but the sound was a little late in making it out of her mouth. Marcellina was the weakest of the main characters in the cast. Philip Langridge was a hoot as Don Basilio and sang well, too.<br /><br />In addition to the quality of the singing, much of the musical success is determined by the tempi and pacing set by the conductor, who must decide when to let the music sigh and breathe and when to propel it forward, as appropriate to its many moods; nothing turns me off more than a reading that seems merely efficient. Antonio Pappano was not entirely successful in avoiding this pitfall.<br /><br />Still, this is a handsome production, in terms of staging, video and audio reproduction, and packaging. Although the booklet does not provide a libretto, we are lucky to have any booklet at all--it's a crime how austerely some opera DVDs are packaged. The Blu-ray picture is gorgeous, not only sharp & very detailed, but also warm for a straight-to-video recording, almost simulating film but clearer and without grain. This is 1080i, but it is hard to imagine that 1080p could be any better. And all that clarity is well utilized in showing off the great sets and good looks of the cast. Because this is only a very good, but not great, performance, I recommend it only in this Blu-ray edition, where the visual delight compensates for some of its deficiencies otherwise. As the first or only video of Le Nozze I have to recommend the Bohm/Ponnelle movie with the dream cast and the Vienna Philharmonic.<br /><br />Just because this is not the best of all performances does not keep it from being a worthwhile addition to one's library. As long as a performance operates on this high a level, there are always a few new things worthy of our attention, even in the performance; not to mention new sets and costumes and superior video & audio reproduction; but I don't recommend this as a first or only version; and I would be particularly concerned if this were one's first exposure to this masterpiece: although they would have had an enjoyable experience, they would go away without a clue as to what depths are possible.<br /><br />Finally a couple of notes on the Blu-ray product itself: I thought I knew every counter-intuitive way the producers of Blu-ray discs had devised to thwart viewers' attempts to navigate the menus, but this one stumped me; I have yet to figure out how to complete the set-up and proceed to play the disc; instead, I had to have my player reset everything to its default (English subtitles and 5.1 Surround, which is what English-speaking audiences are most likely to want, anyway). Mercifully, it does not utilize the ever-obnoxious Java code that renders so many Blu-ray discs incapable of being resumed at the point you leave off, in the event you decide not to watch the entire disc in a single sitting.the pacing was very good.

0385504209|4.0|Nice book, its okay. Not the amazing story that everyone hyped it up to be, but deffinatly better than the movie!
B0015ABRE2|4.0|I must admit I did not enjoy this as much as the last 2 series but I am satisfied until I see the next. There's a time and season for everything under the sun, even a serial killer considering starting a family while simultaneously taking on an apprentice! I do think this is a great series, although for someone who watches very little television I am reluctant to mention to just anybody that this as one of the few programs that I am involved with... so what does that mean??? All in all I find this a very brave and humanistic show, and I'll continue to follow the journey. The concept of a regular guy trying to find his place in the world and focusing his seemingly character flaws in a positive way is very inspiring...!? I also like the freedom of being able to make up my own mind in what's right and wrong along the way, and unpredictability is always a bonus!
B000P0J0B0|1.0|i never wanted to tear my own eyes out and bang my head on fiery spikes so badly before than when i attempted to watch this movie. i tried a few times giving it the \\"old college try\\". a person whos opinion i respect highly recommends this this P.O.S. so for his sake and for the sake of conversation i kept trying. i was thinking \\"maybe theres something im missing, it cant really be this bad, can it?\\" truth is its not that bad, ITS WORSE!!!     it wont allow me to tag this movie, my tag for this movie is GARBAGE
0385504225|1.0|I read and thoroughly enjoyed the DaVinci Code.  But I'm really sorry I paid $17 for this book.  Although the action is reasonably taut, the religious tautology grinds everything into a slow, painful skid into pure manure.    Save your money.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This album starts with a very young Michael J and then goes on to a good selection of  his other work. It is worth the price. It is sad to know that we will never hear what he still had left inside.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This is the worse movie I have ever seen that uses Beatles music!  It's worse than the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie with the BeeGees...this is a gross misuse of the Beatles music.  Love @ the Mirage would be money better spent.  It's High School Musical...just so you know, there is a scene in a military hospital where there is a priest dancing around while the 'dying' patients sing...horrible!  As far as the story, there really isn't much of one...characters are named Jude, Prudence, Jo-Jo, Sadie, and let's not forget Lucy!  I can't belive Evan Rachel Wood was even in this movie...Bono made a horrible appearance as Dr. Robert as well as .  Just because High School Musical made so much money doesn't mean you can apply the concept anywhere...you probably could've done Tommy and gotten away with it but this is a crock of crap.  As far as the historical events that take place, they are just background to the singing and dancing going on as the 'story' moves along.  I don't see how anyone could state that there is any historical relevance to this movie...this is the crappiest movie I have ever seen.  The visual part of the movie is nice but you get tired of it quickly and this movie is 2 hrs, 15 mins.
B00127RAJY|5.0|had my second child 15 mos ago. i am athletic, did a sprint triathlon in the summer. Time went by w/o working out.  My gut and love handles came back, thanks to night time sweets.  i have done this video  3 weeks in a row and man do i see the difference! i looked more toned and clothes feel better on me. i am soooo excited about this video that a bunch of my friends, colleagues and my husband are doing the video.     thank you!!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I can't believe some of the reviews that are being written here...these remastered versions are awesome!  If you love the Beatles, buy this, you will not regret it.  It's like discovering the Beatles all over again.  You ever watch a live band that covers the Beatles and wonder why it sounds so much better than the CD's you've heard.  It's not technology!  This is the way the albums were meant to be heard, I don't care what the purists say.  For those who state that the remastering and recording are inferior must be using crappy equipment because it sounds awesome on my stereo.  I was so disappointed when I first heard these albums on CD that I couldn't listen to them for years...and having no access to the original albums was doubly disappointing...until now!  I also prefer the stereo mixes...makes no sense to me to hear these in mono.  The first few albums are no worse for the stereo mixes presented hear, they feel more natural.  The best part of these CD's is the emotion you hear in their voices on many of the songs.  It's just something that was a bit drowned out before.  Listen to Yesterday or While My Guitar Gently Weeps and you will no doubt understand what I mean.  I will take this over the Love 5.1 remix any day.  I believe this is as good as it gets for people who love the Beatles.
031604461X|4.0|I don't agree with some reviews that this book was bad, but I wish there would have been more.  It was all in the details or lack thereof.  Why couldn't have there been more action with the volturi, they were talked up to have such a presence and then nothing.  I was hoping that Edward and Bella might have taken them over and became the new leaders for the next century.  With all of the previous books being so excellent, I was left wondering, is that it?
0316044695|2.0|Too much of the book deals with Navy Seal selection and training.  It is obviously filler for a tale that needs to be told, but unfortunately, doesn't fill enough pages for an entire book.  A lean read with not enough meat on the bone.
0385504225|2.0|Living in Washington, DC, I eagerly anticipated The Lost Symbol hoping to catch some insight into the local history. What I was left with was a large case of buyer's remorse. I am familar with Dan Brown, having read all of his previous books beginning with The Da Vinci Code and working my way back.     The first thing that struck me was for such a famous author, I found Dan Brown's writing style boring. His character interaction has the sophistication of dripping water. What saves Brown are the truly interesting historical facts he draws out.      The Lost Symbol begins with Professor Robert Langdon tricked into coming to Washington to give a speech in the Capitol. What quickly transpires is a set of unbelievable circumstances I constantly found myself asking the pages, \\"Are you serious?\\"     Now I must add that Brown did toss in enough twists so that every time I thought I had figured everything out, I was pleasantly surprised to find out I was wrong. On that thought though, I feel that Brown lied to the reader about the major character plot twist. Early on, I had made the correct guess about that character but I discounted it because of the way Brown presented certain passages. It's nice to toss twists at the reader, but please don't lie to the reader to get there. [On a side note, I do not know if it was intentional or not but the King Street Metro stop doesn't come close to resembling what Brown described.]     By the time the National Security secret was revealed, I put the book down and almost walked away. I really could not believe that this story was revolving around that far flung problem.     By the end of the book I was glad that I had read it but I felt cheated. Interesting Masonic and Washington tidbits, poor plot and writing style. If you can overlook the negative which I mentioned then you will probably enjoy the book, if you can't then you will probably feel cheated.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|this was a great movie where the story line is simple but very effective and entertaining! lots and lots of action with some really good fist fighting scenes, and some decent gun battles. Liam Neeson actually makes a very good spy/killer. If your a fan of the Bourne series then you will really enjoy taken. The only complaint i have with this movie is that it was pretty short. I believe they could have at least made the movies 15 or 20 minutes longer. rated R for violence, language, and drug use.
1416594787|5.0|This is another great work by Richard Dawkins, very well written and argued, with many fine illustrations. Carl Sagan, in The Demon-Haunted World, called science our candle in the dark. There are people who are afraid of this candle's light and want to extinguish it, this book is an attempt by Dawkins to protect it. Buy it, read it, think and wonder!
0385341008|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Rather than a narative, it is written as a series of letters. Funny, tragic, and heartwarming. I highly recomment this book.
0966638328|5.0|As an oil and watercolor artist of 30+ years, I find this book very helpful in color selection.  Also, I appreciate the authors sense of color and the moods and symbols they depict.    Just thumbing through the book is exciting.  It seems I see something new that interests me each time I look through it.    I also like the Pantone color notations given for each color.  This is helpful as I set up color combinations for my E-Zine or blog.    The Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color and the Artist's Color Manual [[ASIN:081184143X Artist's Color Manual: The Complete Guide to Working with Color]] are two must have books in my artist library.

0385504225|1.0|I read and enjoyed The Davinci Code, Angels & Demons as well as Digital Fortress.  I did not enjoy the Lost Symbol at all.  The story was poorly written the plot was at times so ridiculous that I found myself repeatedly rolling my eyes.  It's infuriating how stupid Katherine Solomon's character is.  Agent Sato's belligerence did not make sense at all.  I'm vastly annoyed by the ending and I also knew who the villain was way too soon in the story.  It really was not worth the time I spent reading it.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|This has been a new experience for me. Normally I read other than fantasy, but this was an epic work. Totally engrossing in character development detail. I have read the other reviews telling that it was slow and boring, but I do not agree. Well thought out and true to human nature. Well worth the time it takes to truly invest yourself in the reading of it.  I even cried at the ending. The next two books are equally well written.
1416594787|4.0|I found this book somewhat frustrating. On the one hand, it is a brilliant and clear explanation of evolution and why it takes a huge failure in logic to deny its reality. (I write, by the way as a Christian. Like a huge number of religious individuals, as Dawkins notes, I see no necessary conflict between evolution and Christianity.) Dawkins frequently does a great job of explaining the logic of evolutionary theory and gives a good idea of the overwhelming amount of evidence -- on a number of different planes -- for its truth. On the other hand, Dawkins is a polemicist. It seems to be hardwired in his personality and he always chooses to write not only for the benefit of being understood but also to be in debate with someone.  This combativeness does not mitigate the truth or accuracy of anything he writes, but it does give the book a certain tone that some might find off putting.<br /><br />At his best Dawkins does an extraordinary job of explaining clearly and eloquently.  And I learned a great deal from his recounting.  For instance, I was not really aware that the fossil record is not really important and played no role in the development of the theory of evolution.  Neither Darwin nor Wallace based their theory on the fossil record nor have subsequent scientists.  Dawkins brings this up in discussing those evolution deniers who point to a supposed gap in the fossil record as evidence against evolution.  But Dawkins points out that since evolution was never based on the fossil record, this is no point against it; on the other hand, all of the fossil evidence as it currently exists provides overwhelming support to the theory.  He also does a marvelous job of both explaining the logic of many ideas such as the rather silly \\"missing link\\" as well as what it means to say that panthers and rabbits both have predecessor species in common.<br /><br />As I said, a great deal of the book is polemical, but while I find the combative tone somewhat exasperating, it also provides a great deal of understanding.  For instance, he points out that so many things in animal physiology do not point towards any kind of intelligent design; much design is quite unintelligent.  The inefficiency of the human spine makes no sense from the standpoint of intelligent design, but makes a great deal of sense if you assume the reality of evolution.  In other words, evolution can explain a host of vagaries in animals where intelligent design fails.<br /><br />I loved about 90% of this book but I was flabbergasted by one absolutely absurd assumption that Dawkins makes throughout.  He repeatedly states that 40% of all Americans deny evolution and believe that the earth is only 6,000 years old.  I know that there are many, many people who deny evolution, perhaps even the 40% that Dawkins cites.  But it is simply and outrageously absurd to state that 40% believe that the earth is only 6,000 years old.  It is a preposterous assumption.  I grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, raised in a Southern Baptist church.  I grew up surrounded by fundamentalists and in fact could have been considered a fundamentalist myself until college.  That college was a Southern Baptist college and I later spent a year in a Southern Baptist Seminary before pursuing graduate studies elsewhere.  I served as a music director or a youth director in several Southern Baptist churches, though I later left the SBC after numerous gestures of utter stupidity by the denomination (such as declaring that women were to be subservient to men).  In other words, I've known a host of fundamentalists and evangelicals, many of whom deny the reality of evolution.  But in that entire time I've known only one person who believed that the earth was only six thousand years old.  It is simply ridiculous to believe that 40% of all Americans believe the earth is that young and are therefore the \\"history deniers\\" that Dawkins writes so vociferously against.<br /><br />How did such an intelligent man as Dawkins get this so wrong?  I'm not completely sure, but he does state a false modus ponens:  either you believe in evolution or you deny it and also believe the world is only 6,000 years old.  I am quite confident that his 40% figure as regards people who do not believe in evolution is correct, but I am implacably certain that assuming that the same 40% believe the earth is only a few thousand years old it complete bunk.  How a man as smart as Dawkins could believe such an absurdity is beyond my capacity to explain.  It is like believing in unicorns or centaurs.  Now, I can grant that it may not be logical to believe in an old earth and to deny evolution, but I believe that this is nonetheless the situation with most evangelicals who deny evolution.  Their position may not ultimately make sense, but it doesn't mean that they willingly embrace a larger absurdity.  I'm sure more people believe that the earth is only 6,000 year old than believe that the earth is flat, but I am pretty confident that the number of people who so believe is closer to the number of flat-earthers than the 40% Dawkins cites.  Evangelicals really don't believe in huge numbers in a young earth, even if many do deny evolution.<br /><br />All in all, I heartily recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand contemporary science more fully.  It also does a good job of exposing - as if it needed further exposure - the baselessness of intelligent design.  I do, in fact, unlike Dawkins, believe in God as creator of the universe.  But that isn't what \\"intelligent design\\" holds.  It is a name for a competing view of the fact of animals species that is intended as a competitor for evolution.  The problem is that it really isn't a scientific theory.  Evolution looks at the scientific data and draws conclusions from it.  Intelligent design starts off with what it wants to conclude and then goes off looking for evidence.  That simply is not the way science works.  And as a Christian who believes that science makes sense because God created the universe with logical principles that we, as created in the image of god, can discover, I want to see my fellow Christians give up well-intended but ultimately un-Christian theories.  God does not love untruth and Intelligent Design is no true.  Dawkins would not agree with anything in this paragraph, but he does cite Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Canterbury, and Pope Benedict as two people who would agree with what I've just written.<br /><br />On a side note, I bought my copy of this book in a Borders on a shelf that also displayed an audiobook version of the book.  I was interested to see that it was read by both Dawkins and his wife Laila Ward.  Fans of DOCTOR WHO may remember Laila Ward as Romana, the companion of the Fourth Doctor, played by Tom Baker, to whom she was briefly married (obviously, before she was married to Richard Dawkins).letely sure, but he does state a false modus ponens:  either you believe in evolution or you deny it and also believe the world is only 6,000 years old.  I am quite confident that his 40% figure as regards people who do not believe in evolution is correct, but I am implacably certain that assuming that the same 40% believe the earth is only a few thousand years old it complete bunk.

B002F3BP8Q|4.0|I just received this remaster of one of my favorite albums by The Cult, Sonic Temple running a close second.The remastering on this disc is a welcomed sonic improvement and I can't get over how much more crunchier and at The same time clean this remastering sounds. The first Cd is a 5 star album in remastering and content. The second cd not so much, some of the remixes no matter how much remastering is done sound dated and quite frankly annoying. I do like Little Face a lot but the rest of the 2nd cd is a throw away. Still Love is a great album and that makes this a must have purchase.
B001QOGY72|4.0|The 60's memoir Taking Woodstock is a story about how 20-something Elliot, son of a Jewish couple, was able to lure backers planning a music festival into the area where his parents run a `resort' motel. The story begins in a conservative rural community of farmers and small town folk in scenic New York countryside. The narrative hub revolves around the relationship between Elliot and his aging parents who own the El Monaco Resort Motel, a deteriorating business on the verge of foreclosure. His mother is a bitter character who oversees the finances and ordering of the household. His father is a withdrawn, tired man bent from years of bearing the weight of silent compliance before his wife while attending to the motel's maintenance. The townsfolk are a stagnant traditional group ekking out daily sustenance while news about the Viet Nam war, Arab-Israeli conflict and moon landing catch their attention in the background.<br /><br />Into this languid summer come two key folk - Michael Lang and Max Yasgur. Lang is an imperturbable saintly visionary from the City with the faith and means to walk the key parties through messy negotiations. Yasgur is portrayed as an enlightened agrarian businessman able to envision qualities lost on his parochial peers and acumen to make this into a venture profitable for all.<br /><br />There were initial clashes between locals and those part of early negotiating. However, once contracts were settled and the project began to unfold the momentum of the operation overwhelmed the situation. Construction crews, event planners and early arrivals for the festival descended. Masses of gentle folk grew daily until the entire region was gridlocked by thousands of `citizens' of the `Woodstock nation'.<br /><br />The carnival of freaks, politicos, quasi-psychotic acid heads, spiritualized bohemians and other assorted holy men and women were stereotypically characterized. Locals were bemused, perplexed, exasperated and offended, but most did not fail to succumb to the combination of gentle-spirited hippie culture and the financial boon that poured in.<br /><br />One particular narrative episode captures the hippie mythos underlying the film's vision. The preparations for the event are done. Elliot, his father and Vilma, a free-spirited transvestite providing security for Elliot's family, stand overlooking a lake as nude bathers play openly. The first strains of Richie Havens move through the woods signaling the festival's beginning. Elliot's father nudges him to go and experience the festival. Elliot hesitates but Vilma urges him on, \\"Go\\" he says, \\"see what the center of the universe is like\\". Elliot finds himself wandering among groups of camping hippies still some distance from the stage. He encounters a young couple who gently seduce him to drop acid with them. They retire to the interior of their bus richly decorated for inner space travel where Elliot is initiated in the ecstasy of cosmic visionary experience. Some hours later he emerges an awakened soul accompanied by the female consort. Still flashing in colors and serenity they make their way to a bluff overlooking the sea of people dotting the night with campfires. The view is rolling and undulating, wrapping around a vortex - the lighted stage in the distance. The lights, colors and liquid landscape coalesce in a visionary patterned dance around the pulsing brilliant core of illumination flowing from the stage. Space and time are lost in the enveloping ecstatic vision in the presence of the Center.<br /><br />This scene is the sacramental center of the story. The whole event is actually a festive gathering to celebrate the eucharistic psychedelic ritual. Its enactment is the animus mundi, the navel of the world, around which the dance of being whirls. This entire countercultural phenomena is like a fountain of creative and colorful life flowing from the bellies of ecstatically enlightened participants. Bohemian and transient in nature it wanders aboutthe land erupting into spontaneous happenings. This particular one, though `planned', nevertheless exploded into unexpected proportions and intensity.<br /><br />Of course this story is one in relatively recent history with many participants - and critics - alive and well. And the verdict of history has unfolded less graciously on subsequent events. This is not lost on the filmmakers who put in the mouth of a confident Lang plans of another festival of peace and love - at Altamont. The irony is not lost on those knowledgeable of the tragic events there.<br /><br />Following this narrative peak the story winds down to address loose ends between Elliot and his parents. The windfall of the festival has paid off their mortgage with surplus and Elliot is free to complete the process of separation-individuation from his family.<br /><br />It was a delightful film that will fade quickly from public attention, leave theaters and be on DVD shortly. For some who go it will be for a moment of nostalgia, an entertaining story resonating with faint longings that surface as one ages. For the counterculture youth of today it is not their history, it is the history of their grandparents. The heady excitement of the Sixties is textbook material to them and most are living out their own generational narrative. They have Burning Man, Goa, Ibiza, and elsewhere.<br /><br />For some the longing pricked cuts perhaps more deeply. Sure enough it was a period whose potency faded with the passing decades.

This particular one, though `planned', nevertheless exploded into unexpected proportions and intensity.     Of course this story is one in relatively recent history with many participants - and critics - alive and well. And the verdict of history has unfolded less graciously on subsequent events. This is not lost on the filmmakers who put in the mouth of a confident Lang plans of another festival of peace and love - at Altamont. The irony is not lost on those knowledgeable of the tragic events there.    Following this narrative peak the story winds down to address loose ends between Elliot and his parents. The windfall of the festival has paid off their mortgage with surplus and Elliot is free to complete the process of separation-individuation from his family.    It was a delightful film that will fade quickly from public attention, leave theaters and be on DVD shortly. For some who go it will be for a moment of nostalgia, an entertaining story resonating with faint longings that surface as one ages. For the counterculture youth of today it is not their history, it is the history of their grandparents. The heady excitement of the Sixties is textbook material to them and most are living out their own generational narrative. They have Burning Man, Goa, Ibiza, and elsewhere.    For some the longing pricked cuts perhaps more deeply. Sure enough it was a period whose potency faded with the passing decades.

B00004STUL|3.0|The plot in this movie is absolutely nothing spectacular and is VERY basic. There are also plot holes all over the place. The constant arguing between Smith and Laurence also gets on the nerves and spoils the slight chemistry that they have. But Michael Bay's direction puts a glossy shine on an otherwise cruddy movie. But he made the movie in 1.85:1. Why?    The plot, for what it's worth, concerns a dealer (Tchecky Kayro in a virtually nameless role) who s an idiot member of his gang. Beautiful     Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) witnesses the slaying and is marked for . She calls the cops but for a dumb reason will only talk to Mike Lowrey (Will Smith). Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is the only person there who can take the call and assumes the role of Mike in order to take Julie into 'in-home' protective custody. Why he doesn't just reveal to her right away that he told a little white lie only to get her out of harms way...I dunno. Perhaps it is because it's the only plot element that the legion of writers could abuse to inject the slightest amount of comedy and drag out an 85-minute to 2 hours. It irritates beyond comprehension and the film should really have been dumped in the direct to video bucket instead of having a cinema release. But as long as the film masquerades as a proper Hollywood movie everything will be okay.    A Hollywood movie it certainly is. It took 10 years for Bad Boys to be made and many changes to the script took place in that time. It was originally set in New York and was to star John Lovitz and Dana Carvey as the leads. It was shopped around Hollywood, chewed-up and spat out by many studios, until Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer picked it up and thought that turning it into a shiny and bright action adventure could redeem it. The budget wasn't too high and Bay did as much as he could considering the tiny amount of money he had (even spending part of his own salary) and did an impressive job too. The action scenes certainly make up for the lulls in the plot. Too bad there is not enough of them.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Don't know what \\"satire\\" is? Look it up. The reviews on 'Shoot Em Up' are terrible. This movie is a satire on other action films like James Bond. It is a very funny film, but if you're a moron, you won't know when to laugh.
1416594787|4.0|Dawkins almost produces a perfect book on evolutionary science here covering geology, paleontology, embryology, compararive zoology together with molecular biology. At yet it is the latter subject which now provides the gratest evidence for evolution that it is his weakest subject. There is an underlying unity in biochemistry (and not just DNA) that is present throughout living things - common basic pathways, common basic chemicals etc etc as well as the discussed enzymes and DNA and maybe Dawkins would have been better to go into these subjects in much greater detail than he does and then hammer home these points in addition to his well worn paths. One other point: the book would have been better without the swipes at the creationists and concentrated on a purely scientific theme. People who buy this book will probably have no truck with the ID brigade but would want a clear understanding of what evolution is about without the digressions (ok I will forgive the appendix which is scary)   It is for that reason that I have lopped off a star

B002GZQY6Q|2.0|This cd goes nowhere. I have tried and tried listening to it in its entirety but it just doesn't grab me like the others. Every release has been topping the previous and I was wondering where they could go from \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\". The answer is, they couldn't. The second cd is much better than the whole concept \\"Incident\\". I have to say also that Steve Wilson's solo cd is better by far than this. I'm still a fan, but I won't going to this concert since the title track is over 50 minutes long. Looking forward to the next one.

But wait, I did it with the lossless encoder feature which imported them at around 900kps--I think they sound great and I can hear all the stuff everybody is talking about.    But, the song titles came through in Japanese, which I think is pretty cool, but I am wondering if anybody else, who has gone down the dark path of ituning the Beatles, has noticed this.    Thanks!

B00000JMQE|5.0|Finally , after months of searching...me and my sis, finally decided to check on AMAZON---DUHH??!!  Just ordered this movie I have been wanting to see AGAIn, forever!! I AM SOOO HAPPY , cant wait to get it!!  We used to watch this movie ALL THE TIME, when we were kids. It used to  F'n FREAK US out but that didnt stop us, we were glued to every minute of the movie.  So I just had to get a copy to show all my nieces and nephews.  This is not the type of movie to purchase if you are looking for something like the Wizard of OZ, or other Disney movies...cause it is soooo diffferent.  BUT ,this is definitely the movie to watch if you just want to see a good fantasy movie---think along the lines of Pans Labyrinth, the neverending story, or Willow.  It is Disney's  best movie EVER besides \\"Watcher in the Woods\\"---anybody remember that???  Call me crazy but I was one of those kids that actually liked getting freaked out!!  ANyway, I totally LOVE this movie and think it is a must have for anybody who like CLASSIC- ORIGNAL and TIMELESS movies!!    I cant wait to get it to show my neices and nephews next time I babysit them and they \\"ACT UP\\"!  HA HA HA!!!!!
B000024E9H|4.0|Interesting album, but you need to be a fan of Genesis to understand what they were going for with these recordings.
B001SMC91M|5.0|This album is a heck of a lot of fun to listen to.  Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears do a very admirable job recalling the classic funk-infused & horn driven R&B records of the 60's.  Like other reviewers, I find their style very reminiscent of the great James Brown, even down to Mr. Lewis' powerful & highly-energetic vocals.  At only 30 minutes in length, the only real fault I found with this album was it left me wanting more when it was over.  Do yourself a favor, get this CD & travel back in time with this collection of what [...] called \\"hip-shaking old-school groove\\".  Highly recommended.
B000P7V46C|5.0|Great album of recordings. Musical compositions of multi-layered complexities, that are just solid listeneing of high quality audio.
B000ULLNDW|5.0|This album is just gorgeous from beginning to end. Jazz/blues/rock/pop/R&B/soul flows from beginning to end with ease. It has a clean live sound and excellent musicians. Some of the best love songs of all time are on this album. As prolific a songwriter as Carole is, she never made another masterpiece like this. 8 of the album's 12 original tracks were either hits or radio staples and the album tracks compete with the hits like champs.     Several of the songs were also recorded and made hits by other artists. Rod Stewart made So Far Away his own and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman is remembered as an Aretha Franklin song. My personal favorite is It's Too Late. It's probably the best song she ever wrote, with its wonderful jazz bridge and understated jazz leanings.     Carole is not the best vocalist in the world but she sings with enough feeling to truly deliver this album's emotional wallop. It was recorded in 1971, but sounds like the whole rest of the 70s due to the influence that it had on that decade. There were many imitators that came later and I can only wish that modern songer/songwriters would look here for a much needed dose of sophistication.    Highly recommended.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|This (latest, mindless) remake of the Jules Verne classic is hopelessly silly, Brendan Fraser must possess an innate \\"annoyance\\" chromosome, and if I saw one more death-defying plunge down some endless abyss I was promising to scream louder than the actors.  Yet, oddly, indescribably, uncharacteristically, I found myself having a bit of fun watching this moronic bubble-gum version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  I'm just not going to tell anyone.<br /><br />Playing a pseudo scientist (which is fitting, as Fraser is a pseudo actor) journeying to Iceland with the young son (Josh Hutcherson) of his dearly-departed brother, Fraser's Professor Trevor Anderson comes under the tutelage of Hannah Asgeirsson (Anita Briem), the daughter of Trevor's brother's former mentor (huh?).  Hannah takes the two Americans on an Icelandic expedition, where they end up plunging down a hole and into a funky world of animated nonsense.  All the silliness is amplified by cornpone action sequences, yet I had to keep reminding myself this film was initially a 3D offering for kids (and Hutcherson darn sure plays to that audience), so it's all in good clean (sort of) fun.  The ending is predictably (and conveniently) over the top, and the plot instantly forgettable, but JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is still worth one or two giggles and gaggles.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0385504225|1.0|Those looking for a plot synopsis simply look at the back of the novel you're going to read.  If that doesn't wet your appetite, then simply follow the same formula that Dan Brown has been implementing in his books for years.  Take your hero (Robert Langdon) add an ancient/ mysterious cult group that is evil and trying to destroy civilization don't forget a dash of some femme fatale love interest and there you have it \\"The Lost Symbol\\" in a nut shell.  Oops i forgot to add the horrible writing and uninspiring characterization.  It doesn't bother me that the book was so bad.  I kind of expected it after \\"Angels and Demons\\" was a complete mirror image of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\". What irks me is that this book will sell millions of copies and not deserve all of its acclaim.  I'm all for people buying books and resurrecting the dying book business.  What I don't appreciate is that it takes a book as bad as this to do it.  Save your money and time and just re-read the \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"
B000296P2G|5.0|I have not loved a movie this much in years!   The movie changes a lot of details from the book (normally this would drive me crazy), but it doesn't matter in this movie because the ESSENCE of Jane Eyre remains the same (and I can see how the new details help the flow of the movie). It was almost as if I was reading the book while watching the movie--she acts in the movie exactly as she is described in the book. While I think Jane looks a little too old in the movie (that is my only negative remark about this movie--in all other respects, I think it is perfect), Mr. Rochester is perfect. They stay true to the characters in the book, instead of reinterpreting them in a modern light as most movies nowadays do (it always seems to me that most movies make the female characters more independent and saucy than they are in the books).  Not only the acting, but the scenery and the music are beautiful too.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I saw this only about a week after having seen Ann of a Thousand Days so, of course, my mind was busy making comparisons.  I'm not a student of English history but from what I've read here, \\"Ann\\" was much closer to actuality.  It seems to me that if you're going to make a historical drama, tell the real story--otherwise why bother?     As far as casting is concerned, Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold were head and shoulders better than this group, with the exception of Kristin Scott-Thomas, who is always good.  Apparently these were chosen for box office appeal. Scarlett Johannsen is a gifted \\"personality\\" (don't know if I'd really call her an actress.)  She is physically gorgeous and has a strong screen presence, which suits her very well for some roles.  However here she was given the role of the shy, mousy sister--what a waste of glam-power.  She played \\"dumb\\" a lot, often by looking blank and breathing through her mouth---not attractive.     Natalie Portman is very pretty and she can act a lot better than Scarlett, but neither one of them had the substance that one looks for in a drama of this sort.  Let them stick to what they can do.  The fellow who played Henry was certainly hunky and handsome which gave credence to the fact that both sisters fell for him so quickly-but he lacked the power and authority that made Burton so convincing in the role.    The script of Ann of a Thousand Days was much more flattering to Ann.  She was shown as an innocent for most of the film and Bujold shone bright and clear in that role, which captured the sympathy of the viewer.  I wept at the final scene, when she asked the executioner \\"if it would hurt\\" and declared that she had \\"a tiny neck.\\"  In this film, Ann was shown to be a calculating, duplicitous girl from the beginning so that I really didn't care what happened to her.     I am not always a stickler for historical accuracy but in this case I think some pretty big liberties were taken with the facts.  Having Henry rapeAnn was certainly a violation.  Also the question of Ann and her brother having sex--did this happen or not?  Was he gay?  These are not minor issues--they are important to the plot and should have been shown truthfully.    If you really don't care about what really happened, then you can watch this film and enjoy the pretty people and lush costumes.  Although those pretty people are prettier in other films.

1881273156|4.0|There are some great concepts in this book, but they could have been expressed more succinctly. Every love language has at least one or two anecdotes to drive home the point, and after a while they become very predictable and unnecessary. The concepts aren't that difficult to grasp, in that they require a story to explain each one.     This book is also peppered with Biblical references. Jesus did this, Noah did that, etc. For an agnostic, this is a real turn off.

B00065MDRW|4.0|In The Court Of The Crimson King - King Crimson (3.88 stars)<br />Original Release: October 10, 1969<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />21st Century Schizoid Man (including \\"Mirrors\\") (4 stars)<br />The start of this song suggests an arrival at a train station but not one that you might recognize.  Then horns and guitar explode in synchrony and a portrait of unstoppable insanity is painted in music and lyrics.  In the midst of this song is \\"Mirrors\\" which is a long instrumental featuring some guitar sounds that I suspect are unique to Robert Fripp.  The instrumental puts you on a rollercoaster ride through hell until you emerge back into the initial hard rock with horns insanity the songs starts out with.  I mean all of this in a good way.<br /><br />I Talk To The Wind (4 stars)<br />In my music collection, this song probably has the most flower power.  This song has a serenely gentle melody with vaguely passive aggressive mystical lyrics.  The extent to which this song might sound dated is also the extent to which this song evokes a mood perhaps unique to its time.  The song ends with a nice flute solo.<br /><br />Epitaph (including \\"March For No Reason\\" and \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow\\") (5 stars)<br />In \\"cliche\\" saturated lyrics we hear the lamentation of one who looks for meaning and value in a world overruled by chaos and destruction.  There is misery and emptiness in the instrumentation and mood of the music.  \\"March For No Reason\\" invokes a pointless treading through wasteland; \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow\\" seems to be the coda that launches you into an endless void.<br /><br />Moonchild (including \\"The Dream\\" and \\"The Illusion\\") (3 stars)<br />Quiet melody with lyrics that paint some fantasy image of a young girl in the language of the flower children.  After two and a half minutes you are required to sit back and relax and let your imagination come in as an additional band member and visualize to some extent based on the quiet free form instrumentalization that occurs throughout the rest of the song.  I find this enjoyable when I am sitting and relaxing, but not so much when I am otherwise active.  This song fits into the album as a whole with its counterbalancing effect set against the strong, cold passions in the songs which flank it. This song will require some extra effort focus wise and will probably not appeal to many or even most.  I can't say when \\"The Dream\\" ends and the \\"The Illusion\\" begins in this song...and I hope that that wasn't intended by the band because I felt like I just wrote another lyric for them...<br /><br />The Court Of The Crimson King (including \\"The Return of the Fire Witch\\" and \\"The Dance of the Puppets\\") (4 stars)<br />The mood of the music and the lyrics on this song suggests to me a sentimental looking back at some lost fantasy realm where magical figures performed their timeless ceremonies.  \\"The Return of the Fire Witch\\" is an instrumental interlude where the music picks up a more hurried energy.  \\"The Dance Of The Puppets\\" is another short instrumental interlude that relaxes into a quiet guitar and flute duet.  This song seems to end at one point, but picks up again.  A carnival sounding organ precedes a return to the timeless main theme.  This time the melody is punctuated with additional instrumental and keyboard sounds that seem to suggest a kind of static degradation of the otherwise pure emotion/memory as if this whole fantasy world-album is now beginning to disintegrate.<br /><br />Album:<br />If The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" was a concept album, which it wasn't, then this album is a better concept album, which it isn't.  \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\", The Moody Blues' \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and this album all bring the listener effectively into another world that reflects our own.  The songs combine and reflect and contrast one another and produce a sense of a complex space.  \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" simply takes you further away from the world that we know.  This album in its new sounds in both the instruments and in its production is a world unto itself and for this reason this album has a timeless quality even as it does, at times, sound dated.  With its stark fantasy and powerful album cover, this album is often hailed as the first true progressive rock album.  This album invites you on an imaginative journey full of strange glories and frightening darknesses.

0385504225|3.0|I just couldn't wait for the library and what a mistake. I've read worse thrillers but none that seem to promise a tremendous surprise at the end, something earth shattering, and life changing, with ultimately a big nothing as a \\"pay off.\\"  It held my attention and interest in spite of one let down after another.  I was a bit distracted at times by all the instances of \\"borrowing\\" from everything under the sun, including the movie \\"The Abyss\\", History Channel documentaries, and just plain stereotypical characters.  In the end, the \\"BIG SECRET\\" was pretty empty and laughable.  All that said, it is interesting at times and won't be controversial like The Da Vinci Code.  I'm just sorry I spent hard earned money on what is ultimately a mediocre thriller with little new to offer.  At least the ending wasn't as ridiculous as Angels and Demons.  Langdon doesn't use his tweed jacket for a parachute!

0671027344|4.0|In this powerful and well written novel, Charlie (not his real name) a fifteen year old high school freshman describes the events in his life through letters.  Charlie seems to life life on the outside and does not really participate in life.  Eventually his English teacher encourages Charlie to be involved in what is going on around him instead of being a wallflower.  Once Charlie participates he finds friends, new activities and even a girlfriend.  The author does a wonderful job of describing Charlie's feelings especiallly in relation to his family.  Charlie's attitude and caring heart makes you feel that he is truly a nice person.  And Charlie is not just caring but also very intelligent.  However noone really notices his intelligence because he is always being pushed into the background.  There is some homosexuality and discussion of drug abuse but this only adds to the realness of the characters.  Many teens may have to deal with drugs, alcohol and homosexuality so I believe the book is a positive presenation on how some of these issues can be dealt with.  I would recommend this book to all high school students interested in interesting realistic fiction.
0312944098|5.0|I actually listened to the audio version, which was extremely well done. It's unabridged, thirteen cassettes, and I couldn't wait to get in my car to listen to the next installment. Think a modern day Count of Monte Cristo, with many added twists.<br /><br />I liked it so much, that I'll read the print version, as well. Two men share a jail cell--one convicted for a murder he didn't commit and the other an aristocrat jailed for a dereliction of duty in the military. Ironically, they look enough alike to be brothers. During confinement, they become close friends.  The aristocrat takes it upon himself to teach Danny, an uneducated laborer from the wrong part of London, to read and schools him in the manners of a gentleman.  When something unprecedented happens, Danny takes over the identity, assets and freedom via parole, of his friend Nicholas. What happens from that time on, is a tapestry of events, challenges, joys and much more woven so expertly by Sir Jeffrey Archer.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of his writing, and this is no exception. Be prepared to become addicted to this story and keenly interested in what happens to the characters. An excellent read!<br /><br />[...]

B002KVSJ7S|5.0|I bought this album on a pure whim, having never heard any songs off of it, nor having ever heard anything from Mika, period.  It was astounding how much fun I found this album to be.  It's nothing but lighthearted, feel-good pop from a very talented young artist.  Mika's voice ranges from a Freddie Mercury-esque croon to a Jake Shears-like falsetto that is wonderfully used.  True to that comparison, the music is a mix of Queen and Scissor Sisters down to a T.    \\"We Are Golden\\", the first single, is the perfect song to sum up the album.  The rest of it flows more-or-less similarly to this gem, with highlights being \\"Blame It On The Girls\\", \\"Touches You\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Toy Boy\\" and \\"By The Time\\" which features another genius artist, Imogen Heap.  My absolute favorite on this album is its most tender moment, \\"I See You\\".  It's a sweeping ballad that features Mika's falsetto with dramatic strings and piano background that I can't stop listening to.    If you're searching for something different from the mainstream, you need to check this album out.  It's one of the best albums of the year.
0142412147|4.0|From my experience, anthologies are rarely 5-star readings. The quality of stories is always uneven. This book is no exception.<br /><br />The three romantic short stories in this book are set at the same time and in the same place - a small storm-stricken town during Christmas. They have common characters and crisscrossing story lines.<br /><br />The first story written Maureen Johnson is about a girl who finds herself stranded after her train is stopped by a snow storm. During the following two days she realizes that her seemingly golden boyfriend is uncaring and selfish and finds new love.<br /><br />Second novella written by John Green narrates a story of a boy and a girl who have been friends for years. While the girl is in love, the boy is unable to view her as his romantic interest. In the course of the story he discovers that she is in fact an attractive girl and finally realizes he wants to take their relationship to the next level.<br /><br />The third story by Lauren Mycle deals with a girl's determination to change herself, become less self-centered and get back her boyfriend after their ugly breakup.<br /><br />Out of these three stories John Green's is definitely the most entertaining and clever. I might be biased because I am a fan of his and don't know other two writers, but at this point the short stories by Maureen Johnson and Lauren Myracle didn't entice me into giving their novels a try. Their stories just seemed a little too childish and superficial.<br /><br />Overall however, this is a pleasant and light feel-good book that is perfect for a snowy winter day read.
1400063515|3.0|I appreciate Nassim's background,  belief in erudition, and espousal of skeptical empiricism.  To my surprise, I enjoyed his leisurely essay style, and, up to a point, his skewering of some pretty important academics.  If you are going to be repetitive, being repetitive about the impact of \\"black swans\\" is not a bad idea, given humans' propensity to ignore their possibility - other than the ones they have  been burned by.     Still, there is not enough substance.  For more insight into the psychology of decision making I would recommend \\"Adaptive Unconscious\\" by Timothy B Wilson, or even \\"Blink\\" by Macolm Gladwell.  It would have been nice to learn something about some of the empirically based heuristics Taleb used in his financial job, or  examples in other fields.  Taleb gives an unbalanced view of economic models.  Models have other uses than prediction such as enforcing logical consistency and better understanding  the relationships between variables.

B000XYNFD2|3.0|I bought this watch about a year ago for my father.  He started wearing it recently.  But he just told me that the watch becomes less accurate.  about 3 minutes faster in a week.  And the power reserve is a problem too.  If he takes it off the wrist before going to bed, it will stop running the next morning!     I'm quite disappointed.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\" is a thoughtful, introspective movie about an unusual friendship, peppered with some effective and striking horror imagery.  While not overly ambiguous, the film definitely leaves it up to the viewer to decide if the young boy's friendship with the undead girl is ultimately a good or bad thing.  A brief subplot involving a middle-aged woman who survives an attack by the girl and starts transforming into a vampire herself is a memorable addition to the film.  Especially recommended for those who like their horror set against a backdrop of mundane, realistically presented daily life.  The standard DVD looks and sounds fine, and gives the viewer the option of seeing the film in the original Swedish with English subtitles, or dubbed in English.  There is also a handful of interesting special features about the making of the film.

0439023491|5.0|I loved the first book in this series and could not wait for the second and I'm now biting my nails for the third to come out.  At mid book I was wondering this seems very similar to the first and here we go again and the author takes us down a surprising path.  I hope no one here spoils it but the ending is a wow!  Read the first book it is well worth it and then read this book and keep reading even if you feel you're rereading the first in the middle because you won't want to miss out.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|First off, the remastered sound is suitably harsh and neurotic, and the stereo sounds way better than the mono (I know, I'm kinda disappointed, too).  But enough preliminaries -- what of the songs themselves, those acid-spiked gems that gleam still, 40+ years after they were initially mined?  Drop the cables, my friends, drop the cables.  Because you know this is the best album ever.  Denying this is like denying the sun -- ain't nobody gonna believe you when you got a big ol' glare behind you, right?  So why bother?  These songs grate in a good way -- no, in a gorgeous way.  This sounds like prime English Psychedelia in its purest form to my ears: beautuiful, lop-sided flights of Art Pop fancy.  But a enigmatic terror lurks somewhere in the dazzling threads of these Mod masterpeices: TAXMAN is bitter and bullying, ELEANOR RIGBY's all \\"I Got Dem Ol' Obit Page Blues Again, Momma\\" paranoid nostalgia, and John Lennon's songs just sit there and sneer at you.  Yeah Yeah Yeah?  Not quite....
1577311523|5.0|What can I say about a book that saved my life, and then transformed it? I was in deep pain from too many devastating losses and intent on finding the ONE book that would cut through my confusion. I felt pulled to ... The Power of Now? What a dumb title. I walked to the other side of the store. No matter which spiritual book I picked up, the magnetism of my body to the funny green book grew stronger. Fortunately, I paid attention and paid for the book.<br /><br />Pain was no match for the transformative magic of the simple practices of present moment awareness and surrender. It amuses me that the surface appearance of my life is relatively unchanged, while I know my life is radically different. It's as if I stepped into another dimension or a parallel universe. Toxic thoughts, emotions, beliefs, relationships, and habits that had me bound in pain and fighting life, even fighting for life, dropped away.<br /><br />While I'm certainly not enlightened and don't expect to be, I am definitely much, much lighter! I still find precious nuggets of transformational wisdom in each reading of this phenomenal book. They ring in my body and mind with such lovely, shining clarity. So to speak, lol!<br /><br />What can I say? Eckhart Tolle, thank you for restoring to me the wonder, beauty and joy of life. I love you!

B000KX0IOK|3.0|\\"Half Nelson\\" is a 2006 independent film starring Ryan Gosling as Mr. Dunne, a white school teacher in an inner-city Brooklyn middle school. Mr. Dunne has noble ambitions of being a positive force in the lives of his students but he's bogged down by a crack habit. He strikes up a much-needed friendship with one of his students, a latchkey 13 year-old black girl named Drey, who accidently discovers his drug problem.<br /><br />Richard Roeper and Kevin Smith's review on At The Movies called \\"Half Nelson\\" a masterpiece that everyone should seek out, view and relish; unfortunately it's not even close to being that good.<br /><br />Yes, the acting is great across the board, especially Gosling, but acting itself does not a movie make. What's wrong with this film? For one thing, the story plays out in a dreary monotone its entire length (106 minutes) and ends on an unresolved note. Yet, even this doesn't explain why the film fails to be truly good or great; after all, 2004's \\"The Woodsman\\" also plays out in a flat, realistic manner and ends somewhat unresolved, but that film is great. So where does \\"Half Nelson\\" go wrong?<br /><br />Although Ryan Gosling is an excellent actor, his character in this film, Mr. Dunne, is lifeless, unlikable, hypocritical and unrepentant; by contrast, Keven Bacon in \\"The Woodsman\\" may be lifeless and unlikable, but at least he wasn't hypocritical or unrepentant.<br /><br />By \\"lifeless and unlikable\\" I mean that he lacks vibrancy and inspiration, even when he's in his glory teaching his kids about dialectics & history. There's simply no charisma that would compel anyone to want to seek him out, learn from him or befriend him, like, say, Robin Williams' character in \\"Dead Poets Society.\\"<br /><br />By \\"hypocritical\\" I mean the obvious: How much of a positive impact could he possibly have on inner-city youths if he himself is addticted to drugs? This brings to mind the absurd scene where Mr. Dunne confronts a drug dealer who's using Drey as a drug deliverer. Dunne doesn't want Drey to be negatively influenced by a drug dealer but it's okay for her to hang out with a pathetic drug addict like himself (?). The scene ends with Dunne having a drink and \\"candy\\" with the drug dealer -- lot of good that confrontation did.<br /><br />By \\"unrepentant\\" I mean there's no indication in the story that Dunne desires to or will ultimately choose to detox from his drug habit. He makes the statement that \\"rehab doesn't work.\\" Okay, that's fine, but do SOMETHING to try to escape your drug problem!<br /><br />There are other problems with the film:<br /><br />- The camera bobbles around too much as if to draw attention to itself (\\"See, this is a realistic slice-of-life picture!\\") It smacks of pretension.<br /><br />- The kids in the classroom seem too well-behaved. This is a problem in Anywhere, America, let alone the inner-city.<br /><br />- Despite Mr. Dunne's monotone dreariness, the viewer does desire to see him escape his addiction and fulfill his noble ambitions. We also come to care about Drey -- will she acquire the wisdom to stay away from drugs (dealing or addiction) and prison or will she too become part of the problem? Unfortunately the film leaves everything up in the air. We don't even know if Dunne still has his job at the end.<br /><br />I get the points the film is trying to make -- this is an anti-inspirational teacher/mentor movie. There's no by-the-numbers breakthrough for student or teacher. \\"Half Nelson\\" isn't concerned with such things; it's concerned with the the simple achievement of going to work every day and accomplishing something beyond oneself, despite a flawed nature and crippling habit. It's a fine point but it could have been done in a much more compelling way.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't hate \\"Half Nelson.\\" I did appreciate quite a few aspects of it, especially Dunne's unlikely friendship with a 13 year-old girl, but the story never rises above its flat dreariness to become anything more than okay.
B00102F5WK|4.0|I film was interesting, but one thing that was never answered is  if the phone calls were made to Ibrahimi's cell then what?  They traced him by looking at the terrorist's phone records. Are we to believe   then that it was somebody's cell phone other than Ibrahimi's?  That is the only part that made no sense.  I also was not impressed by 'Douglas'. He was too wishy washy IMO.  Granted he was a bean counter but............  Basically, it says once again that in war, whether combat or   covert, nobody wins.
1932100660|3.0|The study below is co-authored by Colin Campbell.  This study is derived from the Cornell China Study.     Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 136 (2003) 127-140    Fish consumption, blood docosahexaenoic acid and chronic diseases  in Chinese rural populations  Yiqun Wanga, Michael A. Crawforda,*, Junshi Chenb, Junyao Lib, Kebreab Ghebremeskela,  T. Colin Campbell, Wenxun Fanb, Robert Parkerc, Julius Leytond    Here is the conclusion:      Under the conditions of the low-fat and low cholesterol  diet of the Chinese rural population,  docosahexaenoic acid proportions in red blood cell,  membrane lipids, was significantly and negatively  correlated with most mortality rates of chronic  disease as reported. It is plausible that this evidence  points to adverse cell membrane lipid as the  common initiator of chronic disease. The data on  correlations for eicosapentaenoic and the v3 docosapentaenoic  acids were much weaker than for  DHA suggesting the protective nature of DHA  was mainly from fresh water, marine fish and sea  foods and not associated with land animal products  which contain eicosapentaenoic and v3 docosapentaenoic  acids. However, a-linolenic acid in  combination with oleic acid, also appeared to have  a protective effect on vascular disease which was  greater than that of either eicosapentaenoic or the  v3 docosapentaenoic acids. The negative relationship  of cell membrane DHA with a wide range of  diseases, in the context of a low fat diet, is likely  to mean that the protective nature of DHA or  aquatic foods is intrinsic and global, with implications  for health world wide. The decline in sea  and fresh water food consumption in many regions  last century could be an adverse, contributory  factor to the increasing risk of chronic diseases  and the rise in mental ill health and noncommunicable  diseases to become the primary  burdens of ill health by the year 2020      IN CONCLUSION, CONSUMING FISH HAD WAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST INDICATORS INTHIS TRIAL OF OVERALL GOOD HEALTH.    FISH HAD ONE OF THE STRONGEST CORRELATIONS WITH DECREASING CHRONIC DISEASE, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND CANCER.     WHY IS THIS NOT MENTIONED IN HIS BOOK.  HE RECOMMENDS A TOTALLY PLANT BASED DIET WITH NO MENTION OF FISH.      Here is another trial done in Infants looking at Type 1 Diabetes in China    Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice 65 (2004) 283-292    Infant diet and type 1 diabetes in China   Elsa S. Strotmeyer a, Ze Yangb, Ronald E. LaPorte a, Yue-Fang Changc,  Ann R. Steenkiste a, Massimo Pietropaolo d, Anita M. Nucci e, Shuixian Shen f,  Limin Wang g, Binyou Wang h, Janice S. Dormana,    Conclusion:    To our knowledge, this is the first case-control study  of type 1 diabetes to evaluate the introduction of a  wide range of solid foods to the infant diet through  the first year of life. We found cases more likely to  have solid foods introduced before 3 months of age,  similar to Kostraba et al. [9] but unlike other reports  [11,12]. Vegetable intake at 4-6 months of age was associated  with a 50% increase in risk of type 1 diabetes  in multivariate analyses after adjustment for SES. One  possible explanation suggested by Myers et al. [39]  for vegetable intake increasing type 1 diabetes risk is  that the Streptomyces species, shown to be a beta-cell  toxin [39,40], infects certain tuberous vegetables, particularly  potatoes and beets [41,42]. Exposure to these  vegetables in early life could induce beta-cell destruction  in susceptible individuals.  288 E.S. Strotmeyer et al. / Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice 65 (2004) 283-292  Steamed bread, which is wheat-based, was negatively  associated with type 1 diabetes. Noodles, which  are both wheat and rice-based, were also negatively  related to type 1 diabetes but we did not collect nutrient  content of the noodles. Most noodles consumed  by infants in China are wheat noodles due to the softer  consistency (Dr. Ze Yang, personal communication).  Ecologic analyses including 40 countries suggested  that cereal protein was inversely associated with incidence  rates [43] but wheat gluten and carbohydrate  intake have been linked to type 1 diabetes [44-46].  Klemetti et al. [46] showed that type 1 diabetic cases  had enhanced cellular immune response to wheat  gluten compared to controls. Possibly, since more  controls had exposure to wheat gluten in infancy, this  could have stimulated the immune system to develop  an appropriate response to this trigger, whereas a  later exposure would not. Alternatively, sensitivity  to wheat gluten and avoidance of these food products,  could exist in infancy among some with type  1 diabetes susceptibility, as Celiac disease is more  common among those with type 1 diabetes [47].  Soy milk formula consumption from 4 to 12 months  of age was associated with type 1 diabetes, even after  controlling for other milk intake. Soy formula has not  been adequately evaluated as a risk factor for type 1  diabetes, often due to rarity in some infant diets [5,48].  Fort et al. [8] reported twice the number of type 1  diabetic cases consumed soy milk formula compared  to controls as infants, although these results in addition  to a positive association noted by Verge et al. [6]  were not statistically significant. Animal studies however  support the diabetogenic role of soy protein in autoimmune  diabetes [49,50]. Infants may be given soy  milk when they cannot tolerate cow's milk [51-53],  although we had no information on the reason some  participants consumed soy milk. However, more cases  consuming soy milk also consumed cow's milk compared  to cases not receiving any soy milk at all (data  not shown).  Our results showed no relationship of breastfeeding  through 1 year of age and type 1 diabetes in China, unlike  meta-analyses of Caucasian case-control studies  that indicate a moderate and significant increase in risk  of type 1 diabetes with breast feeding duration of <3  months [1,2]. This maybe due to the high prevalence  and duration of breast feeding in China [36,54-56]  compared to Caucasian populations [5-7,57], or breast  feeding may be a marker for other unknown factors.  Adjusting for concurrent breast feeding, we found a  negative association of cow's milk consumption between  6 and 12 months of age with type 1 diabetes and  no association prior to 6 months of age, or at any age  for milk-based formulas. Few previous analyses adjusted  for concurrent breast feeding with milk substitute  introduction [6,48,58] although meta-analyses of  Caucasian case-control studies found increased type 1  diabetes risk with introduction to cow's milk or cow's  milk-based formula prior to 3 months of age [1,2].  However, three birth cohort studies showed no significant  association between infant exposure to cow's  milk protein and beta-cell autoimmunity (one or two  autoantibodies: IAA, GAD, IA-2) among children at  increased risk for type 1 diabetes [59-63], while the  Childhood Diabetes in Finland Study, which followed  infants prospectively from birth, noted a positive relationship  with IA-2 or development of all four autoantibodies  (IAA, GAD, IA-2, ICA) [64].  In our population, a protective effect of bottled  cow's milk could occur through dietary Vitamin D.  Bottled cow's milk, which is fortified with Vitamin  D in China, could be associated with reduced risk of  type 1 diabetes, similar to Vitamin D supplementation  in the first year of life [65-68]. Current bottled cow's  milk for commercial sale in China is fortified with  60-160 IU of Vitamin D/1000 ml. Although infant  formulas were likely fortified as well, we do not have  information on specific formulas from our survey and  intake of these formulas did not show a protective  relationship to disease. Exclusively breastfed infants  in developing countries were recognized to be at risk  for Vitamin D deficiency, due to the low Vitamin  D content in breast milk [69]. Around 16-18% of  infants in China were estimated to have Vitamin D  deficiency in the 1980s [34], when most of our study  participants were born.    NEED I SAY MORE.    GREAT BOOK, BUT PRESENT ALL THE FACTS.  A HEALTHY DIET RICH IN VEGETABLES AND FRUIT, WITH MODERATE FISH, AND SOME GRASS FED ORGANIC MEATS IS GOING TO BE IDEAL.  ALSO SOME DAIRY FOR TODDLERS IS ESSENTIAL.  WITHOUT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET ENOUGH CALCIUM FOR A GROWING TODDLER AND SOY CAN BE EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO A GROWING INFANT. FINALLY, USE COMMON SENSE. THIS IS A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS LOOKING AT TRENDS. CAMBPELL ADMITS AS MUCH.  YOU CAN'T PRESENT A STORY WITHOUT INCLUDING ALL THE DATA AS CAMPBELL DOES IN THIS BOOK AND TAKE IT AS FACT.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|The final nail in the coffin for the x-men saga on film for me at least as a fan. Though this film made enough to warrant a sequel, you won't see me in the theaters paying hard earned money for that garbage.    The only thing they did right was casting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the symphonic score.    Fox please get Brian Singer back and do a real X-men sequel to the first two so we fans can forget the awful films that came after like X-3 by Ratner and this the worst of all.  This film makes Ratner's film look like an absolute masterpiece in comparison.
0553381407|1.0|I had such high hopes for this book.  As with all books I purchase, I read reviews from Amazon.com.  I read the few low ratings and weighed them against the plethora of high reviews and decided to plop the $16.99 and purchase the book.<br />The book was so bad, I don't just want a refund, I want to write the writer and find out what she was thinking?<br />First, the author identifies various types of toxic parents.  For each type, she has case studies to follow.  This is all well and good if you are able to live vicariously through another's life.  But, I didn't relate to any of the \\"types\\" but could find bits and pieces of myself or parents in each.<br />Second, the book goes on about how the author was able to aid the patient to their \\"a ha\\" moment.<br />Finally, the last chapter is the only part which has anything about what one should do to cut the umbilical cord per se.  This was so unhelpful, I feel like I am more setback as I had higher hopes than to have another purchase which will go without use.  How many writer's until you find the book for you?  Well, I did find a book.  The book helps those who need validation, but falls short if you are looking for a cognitive approach.<br />In the books defense, it does ask questions on the back, but does not claim to help one to move beyond.  I think the title is a huge misnomer especially if you read any books from New Harbinger.  The book I received from them, has helped me a ton!  I would recommend anyone who really wants to get away from the toxicity but doesn't know how, to go to New Harbinger's website.
B000ESST6U|5.0|This is one of the most sensational opera productions available on DVD. The entire cast is very engaging in terms of their singing and acting. Sarah Connolly sings and acts admirably as Cesare, even though the real Cesare probably didn't have a contralto voice. The attractive soprano, Angelika Kirchschlager, is very convincing in her male role as Pompey's son, Sesto, who wants to revenge his father's brutal murder. Patricia Bardon, as Sesto's distraught mother, Cornella, sings several very sensitive songs. The altos or countertenors are also very convincing and add humor to their roles.     Danielle di Niese, as Cleopatra, is absolutely sensational. Clearly, she has the most outstanding arias to perform, including two Handel classics of intense sorrow, \\"Se pieta di me non senti\\" and \\"Piangero la sorte mia.\\" She also sings a lively and happy aria upon learning that Cesare is still alive, \\"Da tempeste il legno infranto\\" which calls for a demanding series of trills and runs. De Niese doesn't miss a beat as she high steps about in a tantalizing manner. Note how she cleverly uses her hands and arms to accent the notes and trills. Clearly, she has the complete package and would have made Cleopatra both proud and envious--including an outstanding voice, charming and expressive acting ability, along with beautiful looks. Note to the Metropolitan Opera: If you want to begin attracting a larger and younger audience, sign this dynamic soprano for several productions each season and turn her loose.    Incidentally, don't miss the insightful interviews on disk three with three of the leading singers, the stage director, and conductor. The stage director provides a rather convincing argument as to why Handel would probably have approved of this production, including the choreography and the Bollywood gestures. This extra is listed under the unexpected title, \\"Entertainment is not a dirty word.\\" We learn that the stage director and conductor were just as critical in producing thisremarkable production as were the singers.     And now for a few thoughts regarding history, fact, fiction, and humor. Our knowledge of Cesare and Cleopatra comes primarily from the Greek historian Plutarch. Cleopatra's family, the Ptolemy's came from Greece and the siblings plotted against each other to see who would rule Egypt. This production integrates some facts along with a strong measure of fiction and humor. For example, Plutarch tells us that Cesare was, in fact, repulsed by the sight of the decapitated remains of his rival for power, Pompey. However, he doesn't comment on whether Cesare liked to stroll about making bird-like whistles. Even though Plutarch wasn't present, he asserts that Cleopatra was unrolled in a carpet in front of Cesare. However, it's highly unlikely that the real Cleopatra had the voice to sing a ravishing aria titled \\"V'adoro, pupille\\" to charm Cesare. It's also unlikely that the real Cleopatra paraded about in cabaret attire and deposited her umbrella in an urn containing Pompey's ashes. However, these moments of humor add a delightful touch to a plot that tends to be rather somber.     Finally, are there any shortcomings to this production? Very few from my point of view and they are not particularly significant in light of such an outstanding performance. In terms of set and costume design, it does seem rather odd to see warships and blimps instead Egyptian feluccas (sailboats) and Roman ships in the background. And it's rather difficult to visualize Cesare and his troops dressed in British uniforms. I confess that I fail to see the logic of transposing ancient and exotic Egypt to the period of British occupation of Egypt in the late 19th century. But unless you're a strict traditionalist, these whims shouldn't be terribly disconcerting.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I had watched the first season on and off. To much going on so no time. It became a family thing with my mom, daughter, and myself. My niece even got into it with us. Getting the series was fast. there was an issue with a couple of the disk but amazon was amazing at getting me the replacement and the return went smoothly
0385342020|4.0|This did start out slow, therefore the 4 stars, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  It becomes a delightful story. Sadie is such a charming 'character' and gets Lara into some interesting and hilarious situations.  Maybe the plot is a bit predictable, but it's a fun read with a touching conclusion.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|\\"Mama Mia\\" is one of those movies that you almost have to warn people about watching.  BEWARE....it's addictive!!!  I've shown the movie to people who were adamant \\"chick flick\\" haters who came away absolutely beaming.  It genuinely makes you feel good....but now for the down-side.  The music is very hard to get out of your head.  We all found ourselves humming the songs off and on for over a week.  Then, just when we thought we were over it....the music would come back to us, and darn it all if we didn't just start feeling good all over again.  Now those are the kind of after effects I can handle.
0439023491|5.0|Oh boy.<br /><br />Starting this book was the highlight of my weekend, I was so excited. I should have waited until next year when I had the third one securely in my hands to have started this one.<br /><br />The story that was left hanging in The Hunger Games picks right back up again, and drags you into the action from the first chapter. I'm not going to give anything away, but I will say that at times I laughed very hard, and at other times I very nearly cried. Obviously, a book that can make you cry is a good one.<br />Problem is, I want the third one RIGHT NOW!<br /><br />From a writer's perspective, it had a great ending. From a reader's perspective, I'm very mad at Suzanne Collins right now. Those dreaded words almost killed me: END OF BOOK TWO. Nooooo.......<br /><br />Read it. that's all I have to say about that. If i say anything else, it will be spoiled. now you don't want that, do you?<br /><br />[...]

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Fantastic DVD.  Received shortly after I placed my order.  Arrived in excellent condition.  Thank you.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|The second season of \\"InTreatment\\" is more polished than the first season, which wanted to take on too many characters' problems. This season, Gabriel Byrne's character is living alone, separated from his wife and family and the target of a malpractice lawsuit that has him questioning his capability as a psychotherapist. He hires a lawyer, a former patient played by Hope Davis who tries to seduce him throughout this season and works on her issues of feeling inadequate without a husband and children. He also consults a college-age woman dying of cancer, a family going through a divorce and a deposed CEO whose company made defective baby formula that killed children. In his own therapy with Diane Wiest's character, he examines his own insecurities and depression rooted in his mother's suicide when he was a teenager. A lot of heavy-duty stuff that makes you think, which is an important message for today's youth.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|Magnolia replaced the subtitles from the theatrical version.  The \\"new\\" subtitles completely butchered the movie for those of us who saw the theatrical version.  The changes they made completely undermine character development and the dark humor that permeates the relationship between the two protagonists.  After reading the outrage on the blogs, Magnolia decided to release the DVD with the theatrical subtitles, but you have to look closes at the back of the box to see that it says \\"Theatrical Subtitles\\".  Definitely wait until you are sure you can get the theatrical subtitles because Magnolia and an incredibly inept consumer relations ploy will not allow you to exchange the fraudulently released version.<br /><br />This is NOT Amazon's fault...they did not have any involvement.  Amazon remains my favorite shopping experience.  Maybe they will accept returns(?)

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I agree with a majority of reviewers that say this is how the  DS3 controller should've been. 5 bucks for a better controller and perfect for all the FPS games coming up. Buy this now.
B001NLKT60|5.0|If you read the first book in Millennium series, you must read this one, and immediately order the third one from Amazon UK. It's extremely engaging story and although there are sections of tedious criminal investigation while main protagonist disappears for a while, you feel rewarded when things get rolling in the last third of the book. I wish Stieg Larsson didn't pass away and could finish all books he was planning to do. Let's thank him for the three he was able to conclude.
B001AQO46E|5.0|I've been searching for news about this blu ray for over a year now, but they don't seem to even have it in development. What's the thinking behind that? I'm sure there would be a great audience for this. It seems like all the actors have fond memories of this movie and would be glad to do special features for it. Maybe they are waiting for the 20th anniversary? Cause it's been 15 years already.

0385341008|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of contemporary literature.  Yes, really!  It is a clever, entertaining tale written in an historical setting.  I really had never realized what the situation was for the Channel Islands during World War II.  But the story is a great one, told in a series of letters, so the reader learns about the characters from several points of view.  I don't want to ruin it by revealing too much.... but it is certainly an OUTSTANDING work.  Five stars are not enough.  Other books are not in the same category.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|Lordy Lord! Another crap sequel from the Hollywood stable of rubbish rehashes. I had low expectations of this movie....it doesn't have Vin Diesel in it for a start. But what I got was a collection of wooden actors and cheesy lines, interspersed with \\"race\\" sequences that made me laugh a lot. I should have realised it was going to be dire literally from the get-go. The Universal logo mutates into a chrome-plated wheel in the most irritatingly ludicrous manner. So what is so horrible about this film? For a start the acting sucks worse than a Dyson. The opening race meet scene had me cringing in my seat, hoping it would get better. It didn't. Then there's the plot, or lack of one. Let's rehash the first film and nobody'll notice. Bah!  The scripting is awful. The hero's buddy (name escapes me due to disinterest) actually steals something from a supposed drug-baron (again not sure if he was a drug-baron, was fighting the urge to read the paper at the time) whilst the latter is offering him a job. Come on! That makes about as much sense as ....well....nothing! You just would not do that, unless you were the world's most retarded individual. Sadly, his character survives the movie. Then there's the villain's two goons, who come across as stereotypical thick grunts who haven't had an original thought between them for years. Tiresomely predictable.  The cars all look like they've escaped from a Scalextric set, with the exception of the hero's racer, which has had the \\"mobile tanning salon\\" upgrade. Damn, but he's gonna get skin cancer and cattaracts if he continues to drive that! Then you have to wonder just what sort of engine can accelerate a car from 0-80 in gasp!, only 20 seconds! Such speed! G-Forces pulling.....can't continue.....review.....must hit....brake! Yep, I could take my old Vauxhall Vectra out and give these machines a run for their money! Twenty seconds....sheeeshh!  The crowning hilarity regarding the race scenes was that a) the cars apparently needed nitrous to reach 100mph, and b) When they hit the nitro the cars went into hyperspace. I'm serious! Everything blurred and streaked past. Everytime it happened I kept expecting to see Chewbacca pop up from the back, waving a wrench and going \\"Whoooaarrhg!\\" Give me a break! I have to say this had me in stitches every time it happened but I'm surprised they didn't resort to burning tire-tracks a la Back to the Future as well. So lame.  Another annoying fact is that Hollywood seems to think that 80mph is fast and 100mph only reachable by real racer types. Obviously they've never been on any British motorway. And our hero clocked 150mph in his death-defying leap off a bridge. It would all perhaps seem more impressive than it was, if the streets were narrower, or you actually cared about any of the characters. Or that a motorcyclist wasn't clocked on the M1 doing 157 mph. And he didn't even have R2D2 on the back, much less Chewie.  So, underwhelmed would be the best word to sum up this film. The racing isn't exciting, the acting is bad and the plot is some Miami Vice reworking with incredulous bits thrown in for bad measure. All in all, a better name for this film might have been \\"The Dull and the Repetitive\\"
1416594787|5.0|Dawkins has written another very intelligent, hugely entertaining and informative book. It is a shame he had to write it. It is incredible that it is necessary to spell out the overwhelming evidence for evolution, which in the 21st century should be obvious to everyone by simply using common sense. Dawkins does it very well though, and his many examples and enthusiasm for the subject makes it a fantastic read even when you don't need any convincing. Having the evidence presented this way does makes it easier to argue against the idiots that wouldn't understand the objective truth if their lives depended on it. In any case, read it and enjoy it, this book can only enrich your life and appreciation of what's truly beautiful.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I didn't read this book with the expectation that it's the most brilliantly written story ever written!  I didn't expect the most brilliant writing.  What I did expect was that I'd be entertained, and I was. Plain and simple.  It was a thriller and a page turner.  It will not make a lasting impression on me and that's fine.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Very pleased with item, purchased for my husband, he loves it, was in mint condition and received it very promptly
B002LAM7PI|4.0|Great movie.   Great story line....targeted to a younger audience but still entertaining  Great animation.  Great characters.    FYI - There is one scene that seems a bit too adult for kids. It is a scene toward the middle of the movie where a woman with very large breasts is barely covered. The scene is about 5 minutes long. It is not overly sexual but, it is kind of strange to have it in a kids movie. So, 4 stars and not 5. I wish I could give it 4 and 3/4 stars.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I bought this dvd after reading several reviews for it.  I believe this is one of the most faithful adaptations of a Jane Austen book, especially when the book Persuasion focuses so much on what Anne Elliot's internal feelings are.  Amanda Root does so much with her facial expressions to convey what she is feeling at the moment.  Ciran Hinds does a brilliant job as Captain Wentworth.  This movie is definitely worth the time and money spent on it.  True, it isn't flashy like many Hollywood movies and there were times when I had to turn up the volume but other than that, this is a very enjoyable film.  Even my husband liked it :).  I definitely put this one on par with the BBC Pride and Prejudice version that came out in 1995 with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
B001PPF11W|2.0|I bought this collector's edition set thinking that they were also remastered. They sound exactly like the CD I bought originally in 1993. The collection is nice, but it's unfortunate that they didn't go over and beyond to remaster the sound. I own their OK Computer Collector Edition as well and realized that all of these collector editions are not remastered. Radiohead has such beautiful sound and were not given the same treatment as the Beatles 2009 remaster albums. I won't be surprised to see these collector editions have another reissue with remaster sound.
0385504225|5.0|Frankly, its been too long waiting for this book! Dan Brown's The lost symbol is a terrific  read for anyone looking for a fast paced, enlightening story.  I bought it opening day, put it aside till the weekend and finished it within 48 hours.   Why?  Because this is the book i was looking for this past summer.  A creative, historical ride alongside Robert Langdom investigating mysteries built within the freemasons set in washington dc with a rapid fire plot.  Dan Brown delivers and for that we should all be grateful he didn't just melt under the pressure of previous successes and not complete The Lost symbol.  The painstaking detail he provides concerning DC architecture, freemason rituals, and the new sciences such as noetics makes you reread pages and ask questions like \\"is that true\\"?  I loved the journey and was sorry it ended.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|If popular music is, for us, what poetry was for the Victorians, Knopfler is our Robert Browning. It's hard not to draw parallels between Browning's dramatic monologues, which could delineate the character of a hero or a villain in a few dozen lines, with Knopfler's songs -- which do the same, often with more delicacy and indirection than Browning could muster.    This album is, in my estimation, better than either Kill to Get Crimson or Shangri La, both of which I love. It subsumes what Knopfler did on those albums, pulls in what was transcendent about The Ragpicker's Dream,  as well as pointing backward to other Knopfler gems, like the soundtrack to Local Hero and to Golden Heart, which doesn't get the airplay it deserves, even from Knopfler fans.    On this album, you get a bit of every Knopfler we know and love.     If you are the king of Knopfler fan who gravitates to, say, 5:15 AM, you have Remembrance Day to wash over you.    If you loved Why Aye Man, Knopfler's given you the another piece of that mosaic, with So Far From The Clyde.    If you liked the grit of anything on The Ragpicker's Dream, there's Before Gas and TV -- the latest in the \\"faustian compact with civilization\\" theme that runs through Knopfler's body of work.    If you dug The Scaffolder's Wife, Hard Shoulder (my favorite on this album) is going to give you shivers -- and make you think, interestingly enough, about Elvis Costello's best lyrics, despite the musical differences, and (I'll bet) Burt Bacharach.     If you think Song for Sonny Liston is Knopfler at his best, then you've got You Can't Beat The House, this time out.    Monteleone and The Car Was The One are wonderful -- a glimpse (something we rarely get) into Knopfler's own imagination, into what he values.    And what unites this album is what always pulls Knopfler's work together: the peculiar beauties of his voice, and the immaculate, thrilling voice of his guitar.    Bottom line: his best in years. Better range, better depth, better, better, better.    Buy 10 copies. Hand them out to your friends who can still remember how Sultans of Swing turned their worlds upside down, and let them remember -- and look forward.
B000001GOZ|5.0|Gathering from the many reviews on Boulez's Mahler Symphony 6 (M6), there are two distinct schools of thought. First, M6 conducted/played with as much added emotional drama as possible. The second method is to read it as emotionally uninvolved as possible. Otherwise, \\"letting the music speak for itself\\".    People that like M6 sounding like the world is ending should try Bernstein's NYPO version.      People that like M6 by the book and appreciate wonderful precise orchestral playing buy Boulez.     What this recording definitely has going for it is there are instrumental parts that can be heard more clearly or can actually be heard for the first time that do not seem to come through in Lenny's M6. The sound of this recording is fantastic.     Think of Lenny's as a black and white horror movie, and this one as a Ted Turner colorized classic.
0307460444|4.0|I will admit I have only made one of her recipes.  The Yellow Buttermilk cupcakes and the frosting that goes with them.  They were icky...basically pancakes in cupcake form.  The frosting was like dipping sticks of butter in sugar.  Too buttery.  I am going to make the banana cupcakes for my son's bday.  I bet they will be delicious.  I am sure the other recipes are great....we just didn't enjoy these.
B00005JLPK|4.0|A wonderful movie about a famed relationship between opposites who were simply meant for each other.  If it were a book I'd be writing that I couldn't put it down.  The visual treat was just as delicious as the dialogue and the music, not to mention the historical aspect.  I was entranced by it all as the movie whisked me away to an earlier time in a place foreign yet familiar.<br /><br />The love story of Frida and Diego was masterly played by the two main characters.  Each was definitely the strength that inspired the other in their art.  My only critique of the movie was in having to hear the non-Spanish language cast attempt a Spanish accent when speaking English.  Short of using mostly all Spanish actors perhaps this was unavoidable.  The accents sounded okay until you heard those of Frida (played by Salma Hayek) or Antonio Banderas's character or any of the native Spanish speaking actors/actresses.  It was like tasting honey in your first cup of tea, then having someone add a sugar substitute like sweet and low in your second cup.  You still had a sweetness in your brew but the natural sweetener was noticeably missing.<br /><br />Frida Kahlo, a free thinking woman in love with a free loving man. A must movie for women and men who wonder why they stay in relationships after hurting one another so cruelly. It begs the question, what will you give up for love?
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Honestly, meh. I think it's not a great sign that a third of the way through the book I was actively hoping for the death of two of the characters so that I wouldn't have to read about them anymore. While the adventures of Robert Langdon used to be real page-turners, this one was far from engaging. Maybe because it was just the same formula- over the top villian, check; Robert Langdon is the only one who can save the world, check; the officials are sort of on board but no one trusts each other, check; there's a strong, smart & mildly to very annoying woman helping Robert, check; older mentor in the picture, check. Read it before, only it was more interesting the first two times.    I will say I read the Kindle version, on a K1 & the images were fine.  The only one that was difficult to see was a floor plan & in no way did it detract from the story.  Formatting was just fine.
B000O599WG|5.0|In '59 when this movie first came out, I was the fastest draw on my street at the age of seven in El Paso, Tx.   I was the proud owner of a Mattel double holster, Fanner 50 gun set (and, it shot \\"real\\" plastic bullets!). My brother was old enough to drive, and so one summer night we went to see Rio Bravo at The Bordertown Drive-in Theatre. Even the front of the screen that faced Montana street, had cowboys on horses looking up at jets flying over head (due to Biggs Air Force Base). And, what a great time to be living there, Marty Robbins had just put us on the map with the release of \\"El Paso\\". We, at least in my mind, were the Cowboy Capital of the world...... dag nabbit!!!(it's in the movie).  Beautifully filmed, great cast, fabulous music by the king of movie soundtracks, Dimitri Tiomkin... what more can you ask?   I purchased this movie for an old friend who one night made the statement that, this is her favorite western of all time, and she can still remember seeing this at the drive-in! Maybe they were parked next to us!). Go figure.   Buy this movie if you've never seen it, and experience the magic of the old west through one of the best of the western classics of the 1950's.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|You like action? Check. You like comedy? Check plus. You like Nathan Fillion? No duh!    Castle has everything, it's got the cool, interesting, sometimes twisty sometimes heartwearming mystery cases that the generation growing up with CSI and Law & Order has learned to love.    It is also the funniest thing I've seen since I don't know when. You'd think that murder can't be funny but you'd be wrong.    Nathan Fillion plays a mystery writer who has gotten so bored with his character Derrick Storm that he decides to kill him off, the problem is that he has no idea what to write next. Enter Detective Kate Beckitt (Stana Katic) she is investigating a copy cat serial killer of Castle's books, she calls him in for questioning and the greatest partnership since peanut butter and jelly is born.    Castle is charming, arrogant, annoying, frustrating and down right hiliarious. You've got to love the smart alec Han Solo types and Nathan Fillion delievers. You can't help but love him as he shoots out one liners that will have you laughing so hard I guarantee you'll pull something.    Beckett is the no nonsense, by the book, straight edge if sexy and beautiful detective in whom Castle finds the muse for his next novel, he also finds amusment in annoying the heck out of her. The sparks fly between the two, something that is fun to watch as they unfold. They really complement each other, she grounds the man-child and he adds a little more fun into her life.    A surprising delight is Castle's daughter Alexis who is not the typical drama teen TV likes to show, she is smart, mature a breath of fresh air. The actress who plays her is great, nobody will find her character annoying.    A cast of supporting character round out the show, Esposito and Ryan add some more comic buddy cop relief, the coroner has some great sarcastic wit, Martha,Castle's mother, is a scatterbrained drama junkie who is another part of the show that makes you smile. And finally the Chief is a fun, if by the book boss that I wouldn't mind working for. Since the show's renewel I look forward to these supporting characters being shown more, they have great potential.    This show is meant to be taken as a fun ride, a nice show that is more comedy than drama that will make you smile. A refreshing change from the drama heavy shows that are weghing on the TV right now. Take a gander, watch a few episodes and you'll be saying \\"Bam Said the Lady!\\" along with Nathan Fillion.
0440178002|5.0|What would I compare Shogun to?  The Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />Monte Cristo is my favorite book, but Shogun is not far behind.  Both books are surprisingly vivid in their detail, describing the period and setting in a way that advances the plot.  Clavell does not waste time painting the backdrop, rather you feel it as the characters interact and pickup things in a natural, intuitive manner.<br /><br />The plots have a similar feel as well: while you follow multiple characters throughout the story, there is a defined main character that you are drawn to.  And in both Monte Cristo and Shogun, our main character truly grows and develops from a simple, one-dimensional entity to a rich, complex, intricate man who we empathize with and struggle alongside.  Externalities play a much larger role in Shogun, so the plot is by necessity more reactive, but how each character is manipulating others makes this aspect more intriguing and beguiling.  You are never quite sure who to trust, and every chapter seems to bring about a need to reevaluate a key player as you see another (always plausible) side!<br /><br />Of course both books are about outsiders attempting to manipulate their new society for their decidedly personal aims, and the conflict is driven by their frustrations and failures.  Though in this case Shogun shines a bit brighter: Blackthorne is a more human, understandable character who I connected with (as a Westerner reading about medieval Japan) than Dantes (as an American reading about a Frenchman re-integrating into bourgeoisie European society).<br /><br />And finally, both books are long.  My copy was over 1100 pages, but the pace always moves and the story constantly builds upon itself making the first 200 pages more and more relevant and yet a stark contrast.  The climax was quite heart-breaking and unexpected, I applaud Clavell for both his power in writing and ability to really define his characters.  The 100 or so pages after this bit seem epilogue and were written to perfectly reflect the drained emotion and shock that such a subtly long buildup and perfectly delivered bang created.  Again, much like the Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />I would recommend clearing your reading schedule and giving yourself some time to really read Shogun and enjoy it, it was well-worth it.reflect the drained emotion and shock that such a subtly long buildup and perfectly delivered bang created.

B000IOM1Y6|5.0|Released just two years prior to George Orwell's fateful 1984, themes of surveillance and intrusion pervade the hit single [[ASIN:B001QYJG5O Eye In The Sky]].  But do those themes really extend into the rest of the album?  It would be a little difficult to make the argument that they do.  Because even Alan Parsons was not immune to the corrosive effects of an unenlightened, I daresay vacuous, music press of the time, he decided to steer his songwriting partner Eric Woolfson away from the conceptual approach both had taken with each of their previous releases.<br /><br />But what was sacrificed in the form of conceptual cohesion was more than compensated for with Woolfson's songcraft, Andrew Powell's lush orchestral arrangements, and a myriad of outstanding vocal performances.  Arguably the best example of all three coming together in a single song would be the album's closing epic [[ASIN:B001QYHH9Q Old And Wise]] which was inspired by the tragic news of a good friend's diagnosis of an incurable form of cancer.  Other standout tracks include [[ASIN:B001QYGEKO Sirius]], [[ASIN:B001QYEB3Q Children Of The Moon]], and [[ASIN:B001QYEB7M Psychobabble]], but my personal favorite has always been the introvert's anthem [[ASIN:B001QYGENQ Silence And I]] which has the distinction of having the single largest orchestral accompaniment, ninety pieces in all, that Andrew Powell ever composed for any Project song.<br /><br />While I do prefer the sonic performance, particularly the dynamic range, of the High Definition Audio Disc (HDAD) release by Classic Records [[ASIN:B000A88FAO Eye in the Sky]], this has some of the most intriguing bonus material of all of The Project remasters.  Even if you are an audiophile of discriminating tastes and standards, I would still whole-heartedly recommend listening to bonus tracks like [[ASIN:B001QYKX10 Eye Pieces (Classical Naked Eye)]], [[ASIN:B001QYGETA The Naked Eye]], and [[ASIN:B001QYEBD6 Silence & I (Early version; Eric Woolfson guide vocal)]] from the recent SONY remaster since not every piece of music that deserves a high-definition format has yet to receive it.  All in all, this remaster is best suited for those who listen to their music on a smaller, even portable, system or headphones and, generally, at more modest volumes.ent SONY remaster since not every piece of music that deserves a high-definition format has yet to receive it.

0756405890|5.0|I picked this book up after seeing the good reviews to help fill my time while waiting for the next George R.R. Martin book... and I was very pleased! I feel really spoiled after GRRM and have had a hard time getting into other fantasy stories, but this book was definitely up to par. It took me a bit to get into it, like 80 pages or so, but once I was hooked, I was hooked! I read the first 80 pages in about a week, and the remainder of the book I polished off in like 3 days! ha. But of course the other books aren't released yet, so it's another series that I am (im)patiently waiting to be finished...<br /><br />Point is, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Kvothe is a great character with a fascinating story. I also must mention that magical elements in the book (sympathy, etc) are really, really well thought out and described in believable detail. The world-building is notable too. Great debut for Rothfuss!
B000NJVWUA|5.0|Along with [[ASIN:B000NJVWTQ Gaudi]] and [[ASIN:B000NJVWU0 Eve]], Ammonia Avenue benefits from a dynamic range that caters more to the audiophile than the casual listener content with the mp3 quality from an iPod.  In hindsight, I wonder if it might have been more prudent to master compilations of hits with music downloaders in mind while mastering the complete concept albums of The Alan Parsons Project with the wider dynamic range that most audiophiles demand.  Afterall, if ever there was an artist to whom audiophiles were drawn, it would be The Alan Parsons Project.<br /><br />Ammonia Avenue is probably the single most difficult \\"Project\\" for me to review.  On the one hand, there is no shortage of truly good music in the forms of [[ASIN:B001N8289E Prime Time]], [[ASIN:B001N84AH2 Don't Answer Me]], and [[ASIN:B001N85NPK Ammonia Avenue]].  But on the other, the album as a whole is the single least cohesive \\"Project\\" that Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons ever produced.  (Even Alan Parsons, himself, called it \\"just a collection of songs.\\")  [[ASIN:B001N85NP0 Pipeline]] is a fantastic instrumental, but, sadly, it is the only instrumental and doesn't exactly blend all that seamlessly into its surroundings the way so many other Parsonic instrumentals managed to do.  Eric Woolfson's gentle voice has such a unique timbre that makes it almost irresistable, but he sings most of the vocals himself leaving Project standards Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow, and Colin Blunstone only a single lead vocal each.<br /><br />It is at this point that I have to wonder if I'm just knit-picking.  Would I ever apply this same standard to ANY other recording act?  The obvious answer is \\"No, I would not,\\" but it just goes to show how high Woolfson, Parsons, and company set the bar for themselves by the release of this seventh Project.  Rating Ammonia Avenue, the remaster, with five stars comes down to two criteria: The stellar sound quality and the fact that five, four, three, two, and one stars directly corresponds to the letter grades of A, B, C, D, or F.  Was Ammonia Avenue my favorite Project?  Not by a long shot!  But there are some undeniable strengths throughout, so I can thoroughly understand why someone else might hold it in very high esteem.  I just tend to favor innovation even if it fails as opposed to convention that consistently succeeds.<br /><br />All that said, I almost cannot heap enough praise on the epic closing track itself.  From the core of the song to its charged bridge to the lush orchestrations of Andrew Powell, there was still plenty of innovation amidst the convention to make this album more than a little memorable.  The song itself seems to address the struggle to reconcile the aspirations of faith with the confines of understanding.  A truly great song musically, but also a truly elusive song in strictly lyrical terms.<br /><br />The bonus material didn't seem nearly as strong as that from [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]] or [[ASIN:B000JLQSWE Vulture Culture]], but will still certainly intrigue the ardent fan who wishes to glimpse behind the curtain to see into the creative process.  My personal favorites were the humorous [[ASIN:B001N87N1M You Don't Believe (Instrumental Tribute To The Shadows)]] for its spaghetti western feel and [[ASIN:B001N84AKE Ammonia Ave (Orchestral Overdub)]].

0385504225|3.0|When I was a young man, my favorite music group was Jethro Tull.  Amazing that they still play, isn't it?  That's just an aside....    The real point is that their epic album \\"Thick As a Brick\\" - an LP length opus of one continuous song covering both sides was magnificent.  Amazing.  Novel.  I can still sing along to it from start to end 30 plus years later when I hear it.    Sadly, with the applause (and beaucoup bucks) ringing in their ears from \\"Thick As a Brick\\", Tull made the huge mistake of trying to do it again, churning out the forgettable album length creation \\"Passion Play\\".  I remember little of it, other than the fact that I was disappointed that they tried to follow up a unique creation by churning out a \\"part deux\\" effort.      Other than the Godfather II, I've never really seen anyone do that successfully.  And even then, Coppolla failed years later when he dragged us painfully through Godfather III, which proved that II was the exception to the general rule.    And so it is with our friend Dan Brown.    He's written a lot of books and I've found all of them tremendously entertaining.  I'd mark every one of them in my top 100 faves over the last 20 years or so.  They were all thoughtful and creative, yet until now, he generally followed a different path with each.    This, on the other hand, resembles Passion Play to me.  It will not be nearly as memorable as The Da Vinci Code.  It is formulaically almost identical, whereas his other books, may have had similarities, but were significantly different.    Clearly, he set out to churn out a \\"re-make\\" of the Da Vinci Code, simply substituting the Masons for the Catholic Church.    Oh, Brown is brilliant, and he brilliantly lays out the story.  Things that are surprising and enlightening are all over this book.  I'm glad that I learned a lot from it in an entertaining way.    But as the saying goes, I couldn't help but have this nagging feeling that \\"I'd seen this movie before\\".    It will sell a lot and make a lot of money in hardcover, paperback, electronic and movie revenue.      But Brown is capable of so much more - one wonders why he didn't have more confidence in himself to develop a completely different template, drawing upon his obvious intellect and tremedous research skills.    At the end of the day, this was a good read, I'm glad I read it, and if the Da Vinci Code had never appeared, I'd give it five stars and clap like there is no tomorrow.    So I commend this to people as a good read.  I'm just left with this strange sense that I came for a banquet and got meat loaf.

0385504225|2.0|I was crossing my fingers that this would be good.  I loved Angels & Demons.  I liked Da Vinci Code.  I really wanted to like this but when I, a casual reader, can predict the two big reveals that not good.  Then the \\"great\\" revelation of what the Lost Symbol was soooooo anticlimatic.  It was sad.  The last 20 pages read slower than the 20 chapters of the book at the beginning.  The characters were too preachy and seemed ridiculously two dimensional at times.  An utter disappointment.
B0002N4ZEW|5.0|I absolutely love this album. None of other, usually great Porcupine Tree works have comparable atmosphere. Might not be to everyone's liking but everyone interested in Porcupine Tree should listen and form it's own opinion instead of relying on overly negative reviews posted here.
B002BFBAUG|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but wondered why HD? not needed in HD & quality I could not detect any improvement over a standard movie?
B0015ABRE2|5.0|We aren't done with the whole season yet, because we choose to savor it seeing an episode or two every weekend, but what we have seen is incredibly exciting.  The writing is clever and witty, and the cast is awesome.  We have 3 adults in our home, and each of us is thoroughly addicted to Dexter.    If you're the type of person who gets freaked out about blood, don't watch, but if you loved Sopranos, this can be your new thrill ride.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|It was a decent page turner.  Very predictable, with a very lame ending.  The book lost me when Langdon was put in the isolation chamber.
B000R7D0EE|5.0|I bought the book for a class and I was very thankful for the quick delivery.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a real pleasure to watch. Javier Bardem(Juan Antonio) portrays an artist with a passion for life and his charisma envelopes three very different women. Penelope Cruz is his volatile x-wife, while Rebecca Hall (Vicky) and Scarlett Johansson (Christina) portray two American friends visiting Barcelona who decide to accept Juan's invitation to spend the weekend in Oviedo.<br /><br />The movie's voice over comes across like a narrator telling us a fairy tale. This enhances the whimsical, and fantastic tone of the movie. In this fairy tale for, and about, adults, we learn about the passions, ambivalence, love interests, and illogical decisions that fly about creating ever more delirious scenes. Sit back and enjoy this film which is full of wit, warmth and life.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney Houston has seen the Devil & is struggling towards home.It's not over yet.Faith and family will see her through this. Know that those of us that love you pray for your success.Whitney Houston is music. Her's is a voice truly blessed by God. Her meteoric climb to the highest pinnacles of musicdom was no accident.Her voice and the music written for her by numerous talents over the years has been a bridge between races,cultures and age groups. Welcome back,Whitney! This album is phenomenal. The voice is where it should be given time & tatters.I hear a wisdom born of experience. You can't sing a song like \\" I Look To You \\" with this much feeling unless you've viewed the bottom from too close a distance. There's something for everybody. Up-tempo & ballads. And,oh,what ballads! \\"I Look To You\\" & \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" are testaments to the restorative spirit each of us have.Thank you,R.KELLY! This album will probably not do as well as it should. Donna Summer had a phenomenal album last year that didn't get the props it deserved.It's the nature of the business,I'm afraid. If promoted effectively,it   could be a blockbuster.I'm sorry for your pain, Whitney. But like the phoenix, from the ashes,came this masterpiece.You deserve your time in the spotlight once again.To a musical icon,I say, thank you ,Whitney Houston.
0385504225|2.0|I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and had been looking forward to Dan Brown's new book. What a let-down.  It is wordy, repetitious and derivative, but mostly and unforgivably, it is boring. I knew who the villain really was almost immediately, and there was way too much about the Masons. The spells and demons went on and on. Toward the end, I was just skimming through the pages to see how it finally ended.
B00006HAZG|5.0|This is BBC at its best! Davie Coperfield has an excellent cast of characters and is indeed a delight to watch. One of the nice things about the film is that it is shorter then a lot of BBC's epic dramas. I have enjoyed the Jane Austin and Charles Dickens epics which I've watched over the years but this shorter film was nice for a change. Part of what made the film was the colorful characters like David's Aunt Betsy. I hope BBC does some more of these great classics.

1591396190|4.0|The book is well researched and documented. The narrative is easy to read and flows well including lots of examples about how modern companies are creating \\"blue oceans\\".     This book is basically a summarized, simplified and plain English version of \\"On Competition\\". Good read.
0061766089|3.0|Although it has interesting hand-drawn diagrams and design-speak, it is not all that different from the average-Joe management text.  I learned a few things but I did not get my Eureka moment.  I agree with another reviewer.  It does tend to be self-promotional.
0894803123|4.0|This book is inspirational and informative, in a chatty, casual style that, while it makes the book fun to read, can sometimes lean toward too casual for my tastes. So I will tell you upfront the one gripe I have with the Ben & Jerry's book: it is vague about a topic I think is very important: cooking of ingredients. In particular, there are three basic \\"sweet cream\\" recipes (pg 28-9) in the book. The first describes a cream that uses eggs, cream, milk, and sugar, mixed together in a bowl. In the second recipe, however, Ben & Jerry point out that this number 2 recipe is easy because it doesn't involve any cooking, and sort of imply that also because of the lack of cooking (and/or the lack of eggs), the 2nd recipe won't last long in the freezer. So okay, did the first recipe involve cooking and we forgot to mention it? Or do none of the recipes involve cooking, and do we then assume that none of them will last long in the freezer? The authors have introduced a smoking gun in act two, when nothing was fired onstage in act one.<br /><br />That said, I still really like this book for the discussion of basic ice cream properties. In fact, I wish that discussion went into a little more detail. (Maybe I really need the Harold McGee ice cream book, if there was such a thing). And if you like crazy, wild, and inspiring ice cream recipes, Ben & Jerry are famous for them for a reason, and you will find those recipes in abundance here.<br /><br />So overall, I give this book a high rating for its basic info content and its wild ice cream chemistry tips and techniques, but a star off for some vagueness.
B001JRB16U|2.0|Like all of us, our granddaughter loves movies. She's watched classics like the Wizard of Oz (a fave!), Black Beauty, and Dumbo countless times. While these films do show their age, they have nonetheless held up well over time and we've all viewed them over and over. I had never actually seen Mary Poppins until recently, and found this film to be quite disappointing--as did the grandchild, who was ready to hit the road before the kids even appeared. Everything about this movie is annoying, from the made-for-TV type effects, to the accents, to the very predictable story itself. It's neither fun, nor satisfying, and definitely not engaging for kids. Get the anniversary edition of Wizard of Oz instead--it's a far, far better film!
0385504225|1.0|Interesting symbology, but mostly a boring chase through Capitol and DC basements with a crazed CIA director. Not exactly an intellectual mystery.
0385504225|2.0|While I found the facts about the architecture of Washington, DC fascinating and the information about the Masons interesting, the story was a failure. It is pretentious, annoying, and peopled with two dimensional characters. You would think by now we would be learning more about Robert Langdon, but in this book he is nothing more than a prop for the convoluted plot. Boring and annoying.
1433272466|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy.  True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible.  It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner.  I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.<br /><br />I couldn't even finish it.  I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th.  Its just that poorly written.<br /><br />I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing, its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.<br /><br />I think I'll donate it to my local library.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|The Resistance is a slow burner. For anyone familiar with Muse's Showbiz and Origin of Symmetry albums, this one's an excellent addition to their catalogue. But if you're new to Muse, you may love it even more! I found myself loving the quirkier songs on this album, especially I Belong To You. For some it reminds me of Bowie's Changes in parts (not that that's a bad thing at all) but when Matt's piano takes a more instrumental turn between the French language Mon Coeur S'Ouvre A Ta Voix and the reprise of I belong To You, it reminded that this is classic Muse! Classic like the heavy riff in Unnatural Selection, with its breakdown that instantly reminds me of their great Feeling Good cover. Classic in the way that they still refuse to compromise on what THEY find interesting to play, not for what they think we want to hear. To me the 3-part Exogenesis symphony was a tad too hyped, because frankly it was a bit bland. The first part (Overture) is one of the finest songs Muse have ever created, but the rest of the Symphony kinda sizzles out in parts two and three. It's disappointing, because the album could have finished on a higher note (11 :P), but instead finishes at a measly 6. Not to say that The Resistance is Muse's weakest album, far from it. This album is simply a slow burner. Even it's weakest songs, like first single Uprising, or Undisclosed Desires (which interestingly has no piano or guitar at all), even Guiding Light (Invincible, anyone???) all grew on me. This album rocks! And I refuse to believe anyone couldn't see United States of Eurasia coming. Sure it's an obvious nod to Queen, but it works! That's what The Resistance is. Most of it's parts at times don't make sense, but as a whole it works. They must be wearing the influences on their sleeves a bit more this time around, and I love it! It's their first album which took me time to get into, but eventually I loved it, every single minute. I'm looking forward to seeing them pull of some of the songs live, especially Unnatural Selection. My personal favorite of the album. Buy it! And buy their T-Shirts when you goo see them! Anyone who is reading this, and thinking about buying The Resistance, do it. Now. Go on! And please go see them perform it live! You will be amazed. I've only seen Muse live a few times, but each time is infinitely better than the last! You won't forget it. Come on lads, BIG DAY OUT 2010!
B000F6IOC0|5.0|What can I say? This is pretty much the perfect movie. There are a couple of scenes towards the middle that I found pretty useless (a \\"nearly nude\\" sex scene, and then a couple glimpses of a not so discreet one) but these are brief and can be skipped. The writing is tight, the pacing is perfect and the action is downright incredible. I found this movie satisfying and entertaining in every way.     (Oh, and kudos to Marco Beltrami on creating a far superior score to Haslinger's original.)
B00284BMBM|5.0|Just goes to show you the voters that call in, text....are tone deaf, what winner on that show has opened for Bon Jovi?  Where are most of them now?  Keep going Chris, you have a great voice and great talent, and this cd is awesome!!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|The Underworld Series is on my list of favorite films. The acting is superb, along with the screenwriting, special fx and music. If you like films like \\"The Matrix\\" \\"Van Helsing\\" and \\"X-Men\\" you're going to love this film. The character interaction between Michael and Selene is simply beautiful, (and very well conceived.) If ever there were a time to like a film about vampires and werewolves, it's now. Buy all three of these films now!!

0812971825|3.0|West Anett, Maine is a small town plagued by secrets and sadness A little like Keillor's Lake Wobegon without the  satire.  Almost every character we meet from 4-year-old Katherine, the minister's daughter, to head deacon Charlie has a painful secret eating him or her alive.I thoroughly enjoyed traveling withiTyler, the a Congrgationalminister around whom most characters,like ponies on a carousel, revolve and evolve. By the title, which is Tyler's faforite church hymn and by thebook's description, I was nsurprised and uncomfortable to find some raunchy parts tossed in.I found these scenes distracting and nnecessary. This is not a book  I would recommend for my grandmother!!!Raunchiness aside, Abide with Me is a beautiful poetic tale set in Maine, where sometimes the change of seasons is the real story.Tyler's love and loss as he struggles to minister to his church members and further delve into the Bible and writings of Dietrich Bonhoefferminister makes this a heartwarming and ultimately satisfying novel.

0307588335|3.0|Those who rated this book 1-star appear singularly annoyed about one thing - this is not a true insider account of why Lehman failed. Pretty much everything MacDonald recounts about the leadership at Lehman is based on second-hand knowledge that would have filtered down through his managers to him, a relatively junior trader in New York.    This book is as much autobiographical as anything else, and at a basic level, MacDonald's personal story is quite an engaging rags-to-riches tale. It is particularly interesting in terms of explaining Wall Street's barriers to entry to those without the right educational background. And I think you have to be pretty heartless not to empathise at least a little with the story of a person who battled his way to his dream job on a prestigious trading desk, only to find that the company he had joined was in a terminal tail-spin.    An authoritative account of the Lehman failure this ain't; a useful contribution to what it was like on the Lehman shop-floor shortly before the end? I think so.
0375413405|4.0|I got swept away by the movie Julie and Julia, and purchased the book immediately after seeing the film.  To date, we've only tried a couple of the recipes but were delighted with the results.  The ratatoulle was an absolute surprize!<br /><br />While it is my humble opinion that the book could benefit from a make over(photographs of the finished product would certainly be of help), the almost foolproof step by step preperation methods utilized by the authors take much of the guess work out of the process.<br /><br />It's a great addition to anyone's reference library.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I am glad I bought this movie and although it was a very condensed version of the book, the characters and cinematography we interesting and at least a little bit of the \\"message\\" from the book is delivered. It was entertaining and we were glad we bought it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Although this is the first official album that Linkin Park released, there is nothing amateur about it. The music and the vocals blend together perfectly, with a style that is very unique to the band. Mike Shinoda raps in a very mellow tone, beating rhythmically and smooth along with the industrial, nu metal sound that became the trademark of the band. The mix of hip-hop, heavy metal and alternative styles combine into a whole new style that is chaotic, but perfectly blended at the same time. The voice of Chester Bennington is very dynamic in the way that is sounds when he screams. It sounds like two or three different voices overlapping to create a multi-toned sound unlike anything else. The mix between Chester singing and Mike rapping creates many different feelings and rhythms uncharacteristic of any other band, many times enhancing the intended emotion much better than one person could.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|For most people who have ever been bullied in or out of school, this is a highly enjoyable Fantasy Film: 12-year-old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) has a small female friend named Eli (Lina Leandersson), who can advise him and, when that fails, can protect him. Having a vampire for a friend is a bit like having your own tiger: very handy.  One is led to assume that Oskar is not even the second of this female's &#34;best friends,&#34; nor will he be her last.<br /><br />The casting is excellent, and the story arc is cleverly disclosed to us. Even the bonus features are well done.<br /><br />My chief reservation about recommending this enjoyable film to friends and family--and even strangers--has to do with an image that appears on screen at 1:30 (i.e., 90 mins. into the film): it SEEMS to be a 3-second instance of child nudity (the camera SEEMS to be focusing on a young girl's naked crotch—aka Kiddy Porn), occurring while Oskar is peeking in at Eli when she is changing her clothes.<br /><br />Yes, in the original BOOK, I've read online, Eli supposedly is a castrated boy, not a girl—but in the MOVIE this never comes up as an issue, and certainly nobody watching the film who hadn't heard/read such a thing would come to such a conclusion from the 3-second glimpse. Some people online justify the nudity by saying that Oskar is a curious 12-year-old, and we are really only witnessing his interest in Eli's body. Others have said that, because Eli represents a creature much OLDER than a child, there should be no problem. STILL OTHERS insist that they've READ that the bare crotch is that of a mannequin and not a living person—and therefore there's no problem.<br /><br />In reality, of course, the actress Lina Leandersson IS really a child, and she is really being looked at by thousands of adults (the audience of the film)—and as that scene is played, most of the viewers will assume (and are INTENDED to assume) that they are seeing her bare crotch. Anyone else care to comment on this??
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Following the success of their last two albums, Muse did a considerable amount of tinkering with what would become their fifth studio album. After a series of studio experiments and endless writing sessions, they finally got around to producing the record themselves and thus \\"The Resistance\\" has arrived. Sprawling, beautiful and most importantly - musical - the album aims to be yet another classic, with the band accomplishing such lofty goals almost effortlessly.<br /><br />Like those before it, Muse's fifth is swamped with heartfelt vocals, synthesizers, breath-taking piano playing and distorted base, all the elements that have come to be associated with the band by now. \\"The Resistance,\\" isn't much of a creative departure for the band, but is most certainly a more focused and sharper affair than 2006's [[ASIN:B000FVQYYK Black Holes and Revelations]] was. The album is highlighted by songs ranging from the epic \\"United States of Eurasia\\" to the arena-rock of \\"Guiding Light,\\" a stunning ballad that is sure to send shivers up your spine each and every time. On songs such as these, the guitar-work of Matthew Bellamy comes to the forefront and blazes a trail for the rest to follow. Each song packs a punch of over-whelming emotion and power. Think U2, but without any pretentions or limitations.<br /><br />The coup de grâce, however, comes in the album's three-part \\"Exogenesis Symphony,\\" which closes out the album, marking perhaps Muse's finest musical achievement to date. Employing over 40 musicians (which is a staggering ratio to the three men that normally make up the band) this weighty piece of music is both epic and ambitious, much like the eight songs that precede it. This piece may take up a good chunk of space, but it also goes a long way in capping off a breath-taking and boundary pushing album. Success and the growing expectations from the band's audience have done little to spoil the band's creativity, and in turn, Muse has yielded yet another rich and robust affair. \\"The Resistance\\" is, without a doubt, destined to become a modern classic.istance\\" is, without a doubt, destined to become a modern classic.

B001GCUO1Q|1.0|This movie sucks! Rated pg-13? C'mon! I tried to like it but it is just too lame. Hugh Jackman is a horrible wolverine. Two thumbs down. Marvel needs to get their act together.
B000P0J0A6|1.0|...You watch it and find yourself sucked into an otherwise story by numbers movie (hey, the old guy says \\"no sunlight, water or food after midnight\\" so you're warned what to expect already). Main criticism of course is its lack of focus on the hilarious antics of the evil Gremlins (something the sequel did a little better) who destroy a good portion of a town, but aren't seen nearly enough to make you detest them - instead they're little more than pests.  The level of gore is surprising, which is how you can tell that this isn't technically a \\"kids\\" movie, so care should be taken with young children (but saying that I'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem....but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time) but it's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too.
B0002KPIKA|5.0|Opera IS exaggeration.  The costumes and wigs in this production work.    More importantly, this production lays claim to some fabulous singing and  acting!  Marvelous, dreamy music!  This is staged like some modern Commedia dell'Arte---very suitable interpretation  in my opinion.  A nice way to bring the baroque to a modern audience.   Must we see the same dusty predictable show again and again?    Welcome the imagination of these fine interpreters of an already extreme story...  Veronique Gens shines!  Her voice is beautiful and she inhabits the character  Agrippina with a passion.  Enjoy the show!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Formulaic or not, if you have enjoyed Brown's previous books, you will enjoy this one too.  The amount of research that goes into his books is astounding to me, and like his other books the subject matter is fascinating.  I am always left wanting to learn more about his topics and wondering where the lines are between fact and fiction.  I raced through this book and am getting ready to read it again to pick up more details that I know I missed the first time around.<br /><br />The Kindle version was pretty good format-wise, better than most I have read.
B00197POXG|5.0|Well, this will be a treasure for us and our kids and grandkids, too.  We loved the series and one of our kids has 3 years of the series so this will be fun for all to see.   I am sorry this beautifully put together package does not include the movies. That would have made it definitely \\"complete\\".   Once the special kickoff weeks are over, we'll definitely get into this series and renew a few acquaintances.
0385504225|2.0|I don't know. Dan Brown does alright when he keeps things moving, but when no ones dying, running, or unlocking mysteries, we tend to pay attention to the actual writing, which is not a great idea. It's like Brown doesn't trust his readers to figure out anything on their own so he has to spoon-feed them every description and revelation. It just makes you feel stupid.
0385504225|3.0|Having read all of Dan Brown's other novels I can easily say this is not his best work.  The novel starts off strong, with a good mixture of excitement and information.  The background information on the Freemasons as well as Noetic Science were intriguing, it will now be interesting to go and sort out what was fact or fiction.  The first 450 or so pages are typical Dan Brown, filled with the forced cliffhangers we have come to expect.  If you have been a fan of his previous novels, you will definitely feel comfortable with these chapters, and at times feel the book is almost formulaic.  Perhaps it is time for Brown to move away from Robert Langdon and move towards the direction of his earlier novels such as Deception Point.  My main problem with the book came with the ending, which seemed to slow to a crawl, and become very preachy.    Overall, still worth a read, but keep your expectations in line.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Most people blamed this movie for the shallowness of the characters, but they are not shallow, they are God driven... It's true that as the gods are omitted in the film Helen appears as a brainless woman determined to trigger a war for love: she is not Aphrodite promised Paris he would have her. Some say that Paris is a spoiled brat who should have been killed: he has grown far from his family and was only found back recently, that's why they are all so glad to have him (moreover Paris is not supposed to be a nice man just because Orlando bloom is famous...).  The absence of Gods had numerous effects, it is not obvious for people who do not know the iliad that Achille has reasons to be so scornful, that Paris and Helen had no choice. People think that Agamemnon is a tyrant ready to invade any part of the world for any reason: he is only Menelas' brother and leader of the kings who have all sworn to protect the couple Menelas/ Helen There are some details that really do not fit in the original story (the way Odysseus convinces Achille to come, the death of Achille...) but it's an adaptation of a book six time as long as LOTR, and including a cast of famous actors that do not like to die stupidly and cowardly... In my opinion it is a very good film, though there are some discrepancies with the Illiad. Those who say that they didn't like the characters miss the point cos the characters are mainly as they should be. Moreover I think that those who do not know, quite well, the Illiad can not appreciate the movie as they should, cos they do not know the ins and outs. And they have not dreamed of troy all their childhood. In an historical point of view, I think that the crew did good research works for the setting, costumes and weapons; especially for the Trojan cos there are not so much relics existing.
B000M0XJ88|2.0|I have to admit, this watch looked really nice when I got it.  I head read previous reviews about it speeding up a few seconds a month, but that wasn't enough to deter me from purchasing it.<br /><br />Ah, how I admired the watch every day.  I would shake it, wind it up, and wear it happily.  Until one sad day, when I was walking around in my apartment, I accidentally hit the watch against a door handle...and the face cracked.  I wouldn't say it \\"cracked\\" as much as it did \\"chip\\" at the top where \\"11\\" is.  As a result, the inside area where the \\"11\\" is located is a little bubbled now, presumably also chipped.<br /><br />I still wear the watch, I just make sure to take it off whenever it might come in contact with water.  Some type of rubber or metal lining around the outer rim would have prevented the chipping from happening.<br /><br />In retrospect, I would have gone for an Invicta non automatic watch for 50 bucks or so.  Just be careful if you do decide to buy this one.
B001HN697M|5.0|Simply the best Underworld movie.<br /><br />Very well done and polished all around... Excellent acting and production value!<br /><br />5 big stars!!
B00133KFGW|1.0|A friend recommended this movie.  Foolishly, I bought it.  It is such a simple-minded story.  Fake fake fake.  The dialog is fake too, and doesn't make sense at times (bad editing?).  The main adult actors are nice to look at, but the story is so lame.  Don't waste your time!
0385504225|3.0|There has been so much hype about this book. Amazon even devoted the entire main page to the book's much awaited release. Extra security measures were taken in case someone tried to illegally obtain a copy. Now that I read it, I'm sitting here thinking is that it? The Da Vinci Code was excellent. I only read Angels and Demons recently. I thought it was fairly good, although I was disappointed when I realized how similiar the two novels were. If you've read Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, you will be able to guess who is behind all the mayhem. It was always the person you least expected. The Lost Symbol is a little different. The identity of the person creating the chaos in this book is so obvious, you would have to be a complete dunce not to guess it.<br /><br />Another gripe I have about this book is why is Robert Langdon such a skeptic when it comes to religion and miracles. Didn't he meet a descendant of Jesus Christ? Doesn't he know where Mary Magdalen is buried. Am I missing something here?<br /><br />The Lost Symbol had some entertaining moments. Although, it all became a bit of a mess towards the end. The writing got just a little desperate. I think Dan Brown realized this. That may be the reason for the cliffhanger ending at the end of almost every chapter.<br /><br />I honestly cannot picture this book on the big screen. If it does happen, I don't think Tom Hanks will have anything to do with it.  I don't know if Dan Brown is planning another book, but I get the feeling it's going to be all downhill from here folks.
B001PPF130|4.0|I just received my 2 CD/DVD package and can definitively say that there is no remixing or remastering of Radiohead's OK Computer album.  This is not like Pearl Jam's reissue of Ten where there was both a remastering of the original audio, and remixing for an alternate listening experience.  This is not like the recently released (and fantastic) Beatles stereo and mono remasters.    The music files for OK Computer are exactly the same as the existing OK Computer CD.  Anyone saying \\"they hear a difference\\" is incorrect, or at least the effect is psycho-acoustic and not grounded in reality.    I have ripped the files directly onto my Mac (aiff, not compressed MP3 or AAC) and the file sizes are identical from the old CD to this one, down to the bit.  I've also used the newest version of Soundtrack Pro on the Mac (part of the Logic Studio suite) to compare the waveform and frequency charts/graphs of the songs on both CDs.  They are identical, same exact peaks and valleys, same volume, same frequency response.  There is not even a volume difference as happens so often with \\"re-releases\\", where they just increase the volume on the newer CD.  These files are identical in every way to the original CD.  So if you're hoping to hear a new/improved/cleaner/different/etc. version of OK Computer, this is not what you'll get.  You will get the exact same OK Computer songs you already own.  To EMI/Parlophone's credit, they aren't even trying to pretend like it's a new mix/master, as the original 1997 copyright dates are on the OK Computer CD.  No indication whatsoever of a newer mix or master made in 2008/9 at least on the OK Computer CD.    Having said that, if you (like me) did not have any of the songs on Disc 2, and you're interested in the video content on the DVD, then absolutely buy this set.  The additional songs range, IMO, from good to great.  For those who have never bought OK Computer, this set would be a great way to start.  But for those who already have the original CD, and have collected the other songs on Disc 2, and are hoping for a better/cleaner/different recording on OK Computer, this is not what you'll get.
B002Q91AVG|5.0|GLEE! takes it to a new level in each episode and this is no exception. The two-episode arch of Kurt's personal struggle with coming to terms with his sexuality is beautifully completed in this episode. The subject is handled tenderly by the writers and producers and could draw a tear from viewers who have a personal experience in this area. We could all pray that parents of gay children could be so accepting, Kurt's dad brings a sweet understanding to the \\"coming out\\" moment through a genuine expression of unconditional love. I loved how the writers let it be okay that the dad doesn't understand the physics or reason for homosexuality, but his love and acceptance of his son is truly inspiring.

0792163710|2.0|Okay, please don't pounce all over me right away for this one.  Far be it for me to ever completely trash something so many others absolutely adore, but I just can't help it here.  I mean, I will remove myself a bit from this, beings that I am not a fan of the Western to begin with, but genre aside, `Shane' is just all sorts of wrong.  Even if this were in a completely different setting it has almost no real worth.<br /><br />Ouch, that was harsh.<br /><br />Okay, so here it is in a nutshell.  The plot is intriguing, but it is poorly handled.  The acting is very subpar, except for one particular standout, and so it suffers from lack of real connection due to that very fact; no one is interesting.  In fact, some of the acting (in particular the Oscar nominated ones) are so ridiculous they are comical.  The fact that Brandon De Wilde received an Oscar nomination for what may be the most irritatingly annoying child performances yet was snubbed for his richly developed work in `Hud' is almost nauseating; and Jack Palance's ridiculously overdone grinning is a worthless nomination if I ever saw one (in fact, Palance WON the Oscar for another `worthless' performance in '91).<br /><br />As one reviewer mentioned; beautiful cinematography is not the only basis for judging a Western, yet is seems that so many have used that to defend the fact that `Shane' is a classic.  There are far more beautifully shot Westerns out there that actually have the goods to back them up, so the fascination with this dull clunker is beyond me.<br /><br />The film revolves around a group of farmers who are being pressured by some cattle barons to give up their land.  The more they resist the angrier (and more violent) the barons get; led by the aging yet harsh Rufus Ryker.  The film mainly focuses on the Starrett family, Joe and Marion and their young son Joey, who stand up tallest against Ryker with the aid of mysterious drifter Shane; a man who shows up at their home and makes his way into their hearts.  When Ryker hires nasty gunman Jack Wilson it seems as if there is no use in opposing him any longer, but Shane is mysterious for a reason.<br /><br />Okay, one major issue here is Alan Ladd, who plays Shane.  His performance is stale beyond belief; so much so that his impact on everyone around him is entirely unbelievable.  Why does young Joey `love him' so much?  Why is Marion smitten with him?  Why is Ryker noticeably shaken by him?  There is nothing there to interest us in the least.  The other big issue is De Wilde, who grates on my nerves with every wide eyed still shot.  This is `child acting 101' with no real warmth of delivery or realistic authenticity.  He appears to be acting the entire time; which is annoying to put it kindly.  How Jack Palance got a nomination for merely smiling like a moron is beyond me; and Jean Arthur, who is usually just stunning, is dreadful here.  This is her final performance, so maybe I should be nice, but what she does is absolutely unconvincing and amateurish.  Emile Meyer has a few good moments, and Ben Johnson is underused; but really the only actor who walks away unscathed is Van Heflin, who actually turns in a believable and rich performance full of life and authentic emotional connection; even if the film lacks all of that.  If ANYONE deserved an Oscar nomination, it was him.<br /><br />The film doesn't establish well the storylines it tries to create.  For one, the chemistry between Marion and Shane is not there, so their apparent (overly obvious) attraction is unwarranted and takes away from the film to be honest.  Like I said, the character of Shane is more boring than anything else, and so the entire film loses all its steam by failing to give us anything to care about.<br /><br />Snore.<br /><br />I know that I am supposed to rave this movie and totally tote it as a classic and a marvelous Western, but it isn't, and the fact that so many think it is so great baffles me.  I know I'm not a fan of the genre, but I know a good movie when I see it, regardless of what section of the DVD store you find it.  This is mediocre at best; at the very best.tion of the DVD store you find it.  This is mediocre at best; at the very best.
B00005N5RM|5.0|An unlikely pair of teens have to work together to save their small town when it is invaded by a deadly, shapeless, oozing visitor from space and a government group with cold-blooded intentions. This remake of the Steve McQueen sci-fi classic from 30 years earlier amps things up with great oldschool special effects and gore, and a story that is familiar but still keeps the surprises coming with its relentless killing spree and conspiratorial twists. That last one could have set up a great \\"Son of the Blob\\" remake! A shame it never happened.<br /><br />Directed by Chuck Russell, who co-wrote this Blob remake with Frank Darabont, 1988's \\"The Blob\\" is one of the many great horror films to come out of the 80's for fans of horror/sci-fi films beyond just the popular slasher genre. The cast, headed up by Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith, is mostly great. Shawnee's acting seems rather bland at times, but she never looked better. Also worth mentioning, the reimagined Blob is more lively than ever before, and far more frightening! If you love 80's sci-fi horror like the Return of the Living Dead films, Night of the Comet, The Thing, Critters, Chud, Night of the Creeps, and so on, this one belongs in your collection. Too bad the DVD has no real special features beyond the trailer, and whoever put together the front cover imagery and text made it look like a dollar DVD. Don't worry though, it's not. This Tri-Star release looks good in its widescreen, anamorphic presentation. Don't hesitate to pick it up!

B000XJ5TOK|5.0|The Umbrella Corporation-a global leader in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and medical hardware, yet they somehow find the time to dabble in genetic engineering and bio-weaponry. Their latest invention, the T-Virus, promises to reanimate dead bodies. When a vile of this virus is released within Umbrella's underground laboratory known as the Hive, they find out just how potent that concoction is.    The radiant Milla Jovovich takes on the role of Alice, a woman who wakes up on a shower floor, completely unaware how she got there. We follow Alice as she attempts to piece together what is going on. Of course, she has to splatter some undead brains all over the place in search of the truth.    The atmosphere in this movie is spot on. Narrow corridors and flickering florescent bulbs creates an eerie environment reminiscent of the video game series. They also borrowed the extreme high and low angle camera angles from the games. This makes for a tense experience as our heroes move through the halls of the Hive, unsure of what might be around the corner-and have little time or space to react when they find out.    The picture and audio quality is superb. The transfer is leaps and bounds better than the DVD and audio begs for a nice surround sound system. This Blu is easily the best version of the film to date.    The special features are the standard fare of behind the scenes featurettes and commentaries. The commentaries where all the meat of the special features is at. You get two full length commentaries-one with the cast and one with the filmmakers. The cast commentary is entertaining, but not very informative. Milla does the bulk of the talking which some people will love while other will turn it off early on. The filmmakers commentary is very insightful, and the track that I believe most people will prefer. You also get an alternate ending and a Slipknot music video. They are about as interesting as they sound which will be good or bad depending on who you are.    If youare a Zombie fan, you will love this movie. Even more so if you are fan of the video games. However, Resident Evil will not change the minds of those who are turned off by the living dead. The Blu-ray version is definitely worth the upgrade if you are sitting on the fence, DVD in hand.

B000EHQTZO|5.0|I guaranty you that when `King Kong' was released way back in 1933 that no one, and I mean NO ONE, even entertained the notion that it would turn into a classic to redefine classics.  Sure, they probably thought it would rake in the big money and that the special effects (which are quite unbelievable even today) would be the start of something wonderful, but to become a cinematic staple; I highly doubt that idea was even considered.  But, regardless of their initial thoughts, `King Kong' has become as legendary as the title character, and for good reason.<br /><br />Now, I will let you know this right off the bat; I have seen both this film and Peter Jackson's 2005 remake and I firmly believe that Jackson's film is superior.  Know that, because, while I am going to praise this '33 classic I am also going to try and point out the reasons why Jackson's is the better film.<br /><br />Please, devoted fans, don't click the `unhelpful' button just yet.<br /><br />Most everyone knows the premise of `King Kong', but here is a quick rundown.  Carl Denham is a movie director who wants to give the public something they've never seen, and so he gets a large crew to travel to a distant island no white man has ever seen (well, except the one that gave him the map) to film a moving picture with the mythical beast known as Kong.  When they arrive his leading starlet, Ann Darrow, is taken hostage by the natives and offered to Kong, who falls in love with her.<br /><br />What this '33 version does extremely well is take the standard `movie monster' formula and perfect it, with state of the art effects that are still mind blowing today.  Don't get me wrong, there is no way that these effects can technically hold a candle to those of today, but they are still impressive.  I couldn't believe that these came out of 1933, they are truly remarkable.  Most of the older films suffered from the lack of reality in their special effects, but nothing is taken away from this film at all.  The action sequences are all superb, and there are a lot of them; each one as exciting as the last and completely engrossing.  The acting is also quite good for a film of this nature.  One has to remember that you have to understand the genre before you can critique a film.  Monster movies are made much differently than dramas or comedies or epics and so you have to judge accordingly.  For a monster film, the acting is spot on.  Fay Wray is totally believable as the wide eyed damsel in distress and Robert Armstrong is fabulous as the greedy in-over-his-head director; and macho man Bruce Cabot makes good use of his character to create a hunky (and even realistic) hero.<br /><br />So, for a monster film this one is top, top notch.<br /><br />But, and here is that dreaded `but', this is just that; a monster film.  Now, I admit to having seen Jackson's film first (how did THAT happen?) and so I was expecting something else from this version, but regardless of what I was expecting or what I saw first I feel my opinion would still be the same.  What is so glorious about Jackson's reinterpretation is that he takes the genre and adds so much warmth and depth.  Devoted fans of the original have attacked the '05 film rabidly, but I feel that is unfair.<br /><br />IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENJOY BOTH FILMS PEOPLE!<br /><br />Yes, Jackson's film is three hours long but what he does with those three hours is phenomenal.  I don't understand the complaints about the beginning, for Jackson actually establishes these characters as real people and makes us like or dislike them depending on their depictions.  We get to know who they are, which helps us to follow their storylines later in the film; and his reinterpretations of Skull Island are impeccable (those graphics are TO DIE FOR), and the pacing is flawless, that final Empire State Building scene is flawless (and one of the best scenes in cinema this decade) and the fact that he actually gets a deep rooted emotional response from the audience based on the love blossoming from a woman and an oversized monkey is just remarkable.<br /><br />So, I don't want to review Jackson's film (I'll do that later) but I just wanted to point out that they are two separate films.  In the 30's you just didn't make relatable monster films.  The point for `King Kong' was not to reach out emotions but to excite and thrill us, and it did just that, but as Jackson (and many other modern filmmakers) has proven, today you don't have to make a conventional anything anymore.  It is possible to blur the lines between genres and offer us something that excites all of our senses, giving us something funny, scary, moving and all around engaging without slacking in your delivery.<br /><br />Yes, the original `King Kong' is a classic, and deservedly so; but Jackson's `Kong' is a much more complete `film' in every sense of the word.<br /><br />And `YAY ME' on review #1,000!!!d monkey is just remarkable.      So, I don't want to review Jackson's film (I'll do that later) but I just wanted to point out that they are two separate films.  In the 30's you just didn't make relatable monster films.

1906694141|3.0|This is book two of the Millennium series by Larsson. I was not really impressed with book 1: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but, since I already had book 2: The Girl Who Played with Fire, I decided to give it a go. OK, both books follow the same lead character. \\"The Girl\\" had a difficult childhood mostly alone and watched over by a cruel guardian.<br /><br />This book focuses on The Girl as she attempts to understand some of the events about her mother and early life. An interesting story where alot of puzzle pieces from both books fall into place. Good action and conclusion.<br /><br />Both books are OK, I've read better and I've read worse. I don't think I will invest in book 3
0374530718|3.0|I bought this book for a philosophy class I am taking. The book was a very good intro to philosophy and gives the ideas in creative ways. While it was good at giving the history and evoking thought I felt the story was a little lame and probably wouldn't read it for just the fun of it.     Great book if you want to know about philosophy mediocre book if you just want to read a good story.
B0025KVLUG|5.0|Ok, i am pretty tired of people bashing this album for containing a whole side of George Martin composed orchestra tunes. I think they are fabulous tunes. If people are bashing those they are bashing Martin, the man who composed the strings to Yesterday and LOVE's While My Guitar Gently Weeps. People need to get off this album, its strictly a fun one, nothing more and nothing less. Yes there are 2 tunes that were on previous albums, but the 4 new cuts make up for that as 3 of them are very psychedelic, and all together now is just a fun tune that fits the film perfectly.<br /><br />the orchestral score sounds great in remastered form, as do the other tunes but hey bulldog still suffers from separation in the verses in john's vocals. everything is so much richer and more clarity in the percussion and bass makes this album even better.<br /><br />this is a must own as is all of the beatles studio albums. just get both boxes : )

B0007KTBIU|4.0|My mother used to say I was descended from the real Pocahontas's tribe, but I never saw any evidence to that effect. Nevertheless, it interested me in looking up her story. The real story is that she was a hostage of the white settlers, assigned to Capt. Smith when she was a teenager captured from her father's house. Since this was a well-known Indian custom (and ancient practice among humans), there was little surprise or action proceeding from this kidnapping, and she was a hostage to peace between the Powhatans and the Europeans. It is unknown what Smith's and Pocahontas's feelings were about each other. Smith took her, still a teenager, to England dressed in English clothing of the time (and most of the true portrayals of Pocahontas are in English clothing). Smith did marry her, and Pocahontas bore him a child. She died of (I think) tuberculosis before she and her family could sail back to the US, at the age of 19, having been displayed at the English court as a reformed savage.
B000000OAC|5.0|Released after the magnificent one-two punch of A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races, this particular album underwhelmed some on its initial release. Severely stripped down, Queen did away with a lot of the operatics and novelty songs on this outing- the closest to one of those familiar lightweight Queen tracks being John Deacon's latin-tinged Who Needs You. This is a band flexing their musical muscles, with the songs sounding like they were largely recorded live in the studio with overdubs done afterwards, rather than the albums before that sounded like the songs were largely pieced together bit by bit.   The album begins with the now overly-familiar We Will Rock You, an instant classic, and a ballsy way to start an album. It would signify that this was a more basic Queen- rockier, edgier; abandoning all the studio trickery employed on the previous albums. I wasn't around at the time, but I can only imagine that Queen were tiring of being criticized for hiding behind overdubs, and wanted to present a more natural, harder side of themselves. If you have heard A Night At The Opera, and liked Sweet Lady, you will find plenty here of that nature to whet your appetite. We Are The Champions follows- an overly theatrical Freddie anthem, that has since become ubiquitous. If you're new to this album, the first real surprise (other than that wonderful album cover) will be Sheer Heart Attack- a Roger Taylor belter that is pure punk. Racing along at break-neck speed, the song is wonderfully nonsensical and contains truly great lyrics.   All Dead All Dead follows before Spread Your Wings slowly unfurls itself before the listener. A John Deacon ballad about escaping ennui- it is an under-appreciated Queen classic. As anthemic as anything else they ever released, it is a shame that this song kind of got left by the wayside somewhat.  Freddie delivers a wonderful vocal here, and Brian's guitar-work is as illuminating as ever. Fight From The Inside is a standard Roger rocker, but you can hear that his songwriting is developing nicely at this point. If you dig this particular track, then you should go and investigate his solo albums, Fun In Space and Strange Frontier- they are full of little gems like this.   One of only three Freddie compositions on this album, Get Down Make Love comes next. Dirty, sweaty and filled with innuendo (\\"You say you hungry, I give you meat\\"), it is slightly off-kilter with the rest of the album, and is all the better for it. A real Queen curio, that you will either fall in love with or despise. It was later covered by Nine Inch Nails, but this is by far the better version. Brian's bluesy Sleeping On The Sidewalk is the album's most inconsequential track. By no means a bad song, but clearly filler- Brian recounts life on the road as a struggling musician over a simple backing. The aforementioned Who Needs You makes a brief appearance before...  It's Late. The standout track on the album. In my opinion it is the most under-appreciated song in the whole Queen canon. Penned by Brian May, it is an epic guitar-heavy song about love gone bad. Freddie's voice is magnificent here as he towers over this track with such command; his phrasing is wonderful- his ad-libs are perfect as always. This really is the highlight, on an album filled with highlights.   The lights go down as Freddie sits down at the piano for his beautiful, self-penned, My Melancholy Blues. The album ends as it began- stripped down and honest. Y'see, this is Queen's last truly honest album, up until the melancholy-drenched Innuendo, anyway. Here the songs seem to mean something; be it dealing with being under the spotlight or trying to survive within a crumbling relationship. Lyrically, the songs would become more generic after this outing. I don't have a problem with that myself. I never really looked to Queen to dazzle me with their words- though I do miss the wonderfully inventive lyrics of those early Queen records.   I have lived with this album for many years now. I first heard it as a teen, and fell in love with it immediately. It's a far more concise affair than the follow-up album, Jazz. This would be in my top five Queen albums, alongside Innuendo, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night At The Opera and Queen II. If you're a fan of the heavier Queen songs, then give this album a try. If, on the other hand, you prefer the more outrageous efforts, then go for Queen II, or A Night At The Opera. But this really is worth the price of admission for It's Late alone.

0525951113|3.0|The book is high on technology and cutting edge inventions, but it seems as though he definitely stretched the very limits of literary license. I really enjoyed parts of the book and at other parts he left me wondering how he got from A to Z, because B through Y would make no sense.    To start off there is character development, but it's in the wrong places.  Many times I was left wondering who this main character was and how did they get there?  Usually when a person gets introduced in the beginning they are the characters that are the primary focus.  100 pages in he seems to introduce new characters, develop the character and then they drop off the entire novel except for a few pages.  He literally spent 20 to 40 pages developing a character that would be seen for a total of 5 to 10 pages through the rest of the book.    One character he put in \\"The Major\\" was never developed and he attempts to throw a twist into it that was a give away 100 pages earlier.  He attempts to portray The Major as a shadowy character he succeeds a little, but mostly portrays him as a bully, a moron and a social misfit.  At one point the Major pulls a gun on another character and the dialog seemed to appear out of a B-Rated movie. I could picture Dolph Lundgren trying his best intimidation voice saying those lines.  It wasn't very good.  I don't usually cringe at a bad dialog, but that one was terrible.    The \\"Daemon\\" appears to learn.  It also knows about technology before it has been invented.  It triggers things like orders for products, recruitment of specific people literally months/years after it starts.  It seems to make decisions, not based on how a computer makes a decision, but how a person sorts through options and goes with a gut feeling.    The book suggests that a single person wrote these literally billions of lines of code (suggesting that maybe two people helped) in just a couple of years after the dead guy had developed brain cancer.  All I can say is that's some awesome project management.  I've been involved with projects that I would be luck to get 100 lines of code out of a team in a day.  But billions out of three people in a couple of years?  Microsoft hires the wrong people.    For his first book I will applaud him.  It is a very good first attempt.  I have yet to completely write a novel so he deserves credit for that.  There were parts were it seemed as if I couldn't put it down and there were just as many parts where I couldn't pick it up.      There have been suggestions of a movie.  I look forward to it, but I'm not sure I will bother with theaters.  I am looking forward to reading the sequel.  I'm sure his writing will improve and I really believe he will be comparable to Neal Stephenson, but like anything he's just starting.  He deserves the support of the community, because his ideas are truly unique.  He is a gifted author, but he's just getting started.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I love this new album, I have listened to it objectively. When Head Crusher was released, I thought the riffs were great but didn't like the singing, I was worried this was going to be United Abominations II. 1320 was released and I thought to myself, \\"eh, sounds a bit like 520 combined with Liar, it sounds better than Head Crusher, but not that great.\\" I was thinking it would be just a good Megadeth album.     Then I got the album, I heard \\"How the Story Ends\\", \\"Dialectic Chaos\\", \\"44 Minutes\\", \\"The Right To Go Insane\\", \\"Bodies\\", and I could not believe my ears--this album is one of those LEGENDARY MEGADETH ALBUMS. This album makes United Abominations look amateur. The sound quality is so amazing, the new distortions and guitar effects are incredible.     Endgame has the quality that's been missing since Cryptic Writings. The songs have the extra detail and perfected choruses. The riffs are mind-blowing, probably some of the best riffs since Countdown to Extinction.     Chris Broderick is also a great addition to the band. I think he needs to stop shredding and make more solos like in Dialectic Chaos and How the Story Ends. Dialectic Chaos solo almost blows Marty Friedman out of the water, and I cannot believe I just wrote that.
B002JODUI4|5.0|Random Album Title was great - but FLoaBN seems to take up where he left off.  Deadmau5 has been a rising star in the Progressive House genre of Electro music and this album will only propel him further to the top.      This ablum features 2 great mixes of one of my favorite Deadmau5 songs Ghosts-N-Stuff.      If you are a fan of Electro/House/or Progressive House you must pick up this title.
B0015AARJI|2.0|I have purchased three of these controllers and something has gone wrong with each of them. I returned one to Sony and they sent me a controller that malfunctioned within two weeks. The non-DualShock PS3 controller was much more durable. This controller has been a dissapointment. I think that I will buy a generic controller next time. At least if that one breaks, I wont be out of [...] These are the XBOX 360 of controllers. Beware!
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I just watched this movie for the very first time. I'm a Steve Mcqueen fan, and I always wanted to see this movie. It's one of Steve Mcqueen's best. Steve Mcqueen plays Papillion, a man who was framed for killing a pimp. Dustin Hoffman plays a man who was envolved in a money scam. The two men meet in the french prison and bond after time. I almost didn't want this movie to end it was so good. Papillion faces a lot of hard times in the prison. But in the end his hard work pays off and he escapes. I do have one question, this movie rated \\"R\\" on this website. But I went to Walmart and purchased a double feature movie dvd of Steve Mcqueen. \\"Bullit\\" and Papillon\\"  On the back it said Papillon was rated \\"PG\\". I don't buy Rated \\"R\\" movies, so I don't know what's going on. Did they change the rating? Or was it a miss print?
0385341008|5.0|When I finished this book, I felt so happy.  I'd come to know a wonderful group of people (with one exception) whose courage and values were so admirable.  I intend to buy this in hard copy, so that I can re-read it every year.  It will be like taking a week's holiday with people one loves in a place that is as near perfect as one can find.<br /><br />What I didn't know was what the islanders experienced during WWII - having been cut off from England, under enemy occupation, not knowing with any certainty what had happened to family and friends in England, nor the effect of the Blitz, and facing the threat of deportation to the camps if they fell foul of the Germans.  This was a completely unknown part of British history to me and was so enlightening.<br /><br />I really like the epistolary form of the novel because it encapsulates the action without going into long descriptions of vistas and sunsets or the bemusings of boring minds.  It gets down to business, moves the story-line along at a good pace, and introduces characters quite quickly without being confusing.  Initially, I had to turn back to one or two earlier letters to remember who was who, but once I settled into it, I was in love.  I have never met such a nice group of people.<br /><br />I know it is only a story, but the authors brought them to life so beautifully that they felt real.  The only disappointment was not getting the recipe for the Potato Peel Pie, not that I think I'd actually try it.<br /><br />So, buy it, give it to your nearest and dearest, and beg the authors for a sequel.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Being the obsessive Lady Gaga fan that I am, this album is absolutley amazing. Lady Gaga is an amazingly interesting and talented woman. I don't know why people bash her all the time because she is an amazingly talented woman. And so what if some of her songs are sexual, so what? I don't really blame her anyway because you're kind like that if you used to be a Burlesque Dancer. All songs on here have an amazing beat especially if you have High Resolution Earphones like me. Lady Gaga already has 5 singles on the top 100 and has only been around for a year and already she's made it big and had already just did a photoshoot with the bestest photoshooter ever (I forgot what the name was, LoL) and already she's about to release a new deluxe album of this CD includeing 2 discs and 4 or more songs and will be later releasing her own fashion line. This Cd is absolutley amazing with great danceable beats but with one slow song which I think is pretty good too called \\"Brown Eyes\\". Personally, the bestest songs on this CD are \\"Poker Face\\", \\"Beautiful, Dirty Rich\\", \\"Money Honey\\", \\"Paper Gangsta\\", and \\"I Like It Rough\\". This CD is amazing you won't regret it unless you're one of those people if you know what I mean.<br />:)  :)  :)  :)  :)
0061766089|5.0|I love this book.<br /><br />I've been reading books lately on how to change your thinking or you way of thinking to become more innovating.<br /><br />I do marketing and small business work and being able to go to a company and work up a unique advertising campaign that conveys their message and goals aligned with the marketing can at times be tough (especially under a very tight deadline).<br /><br />this book has helped changed the way I go about working with my clients and forming my own ideas for my own businesses.<br /><br />I do recommend this book, as well as another book I recently read called \\"Imagination First: Unlocking the Power of Possibility \\"

0375507256|5.0|I'm sorry, but I have to give this book five stars.  I probably shouldn't.  I should probably grade it down for failing to hold together as a novel (the six novellas do not a novel make).  And I should probably fault it for including an cheesy thriller in its pages (what the heck was that doing in there?).  And I could also criticize the way Mitchell sometimes seems to erase his own efforts with odd backward glances and nervous apologies.  But no.  I cannot demote this work.  Nor does Mitchell need to apologize for anything.      How then to assess this work?  As in inventive, innovative book, penned by an author whose vocal range is off the charts.  Is there any tune this man can't sing?  From 19th century gentlemen's diary to an invented post-apocalypse creole?  This man can flat-out write.      What sends me into five-star range, though, is \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After.\\"  This is one of the best things ever written in the post-apocalpse genre and a tour de force of fiction.  As if he'd been an anthropologist in this future society for years, Mitchell captures a sense of the rich complexity that might be mistaken as \\"primitive.\\"  A mind-blowing tale.      Also excellent was the science-fictional tale, \\"An Orison of Sonmi~451.\\"  It is easily one of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read.  The other tales, with the exception of the trite \\"Half-Lives,\\" stir the mind and soul and transport the reader to a richly imagined place and time.  What is remarkable about _Cloud Atlas_ is Mitchell's ability to create six worlds, five of which seem deep and compelling--as if the tales are barely scratching huge solids beneath.  I'm sorry: I will not forget this masterful, though partly flawed, book.
1400034779|4.0|Precious Ramotswe had a short nightmarish marriage to Note Mokoti and gave birth to a child who lived only five days. For the next fourteen years she stayed with her father until his death when she was thirty four. Luckily he left her well off so she set up a detective agency.    The rest of the book deals with the cases she handled and how she handled them. Many of the stories were very interesting but there were some weak ones too. For example the case of Malatsi who disappeared in the river, when he was about to be baptized. How did Mma Ramotswe know that he was eaten by a crocodile and above all how to position herself in a place and time for the crocodile?!! After killing the animal she slit open its belly and found undigested bangles and rings and a wristwatch and so solved the case. Sorry, to me this was weak.    The author captures some of the nuances very well indeed and I liked how the book ends on a pleasantly romantic note.
1584282584|5.0|Neil van Niekerk's \\"On-Camera Flash Techniques for Digital Wedding and Portrait Photography\\" provides techniques in obtaining great portrait and wedding photographs with just your camera and one flash that mounts to your camera.  Using just the environment around him and one piece of black foam, he instructs you about how to make flash in your photographs subtle enough not to look like flash while properly exposing the subject.  As important as the written material itself, there are a lot of photograph examples with setting information.  Neil notes that he did not do post-processing on the photographs other than a white balance adjustment to show you the type of photographs you can achieve when you have read his book and have practiced his techniques.  The book was easy to read and not overly technical.  However, you do need a basic understanding of what aperture, ISO, and shutter speed is and how that affects exposure.    The only thing I dislike about this book is the layout and presentation, which is not the fault of the author and is not reflected in the rating.  Only the first paragraph in a section is indented.  This is odd, because many modern technical books on the market no longer indent paragraphs and providing more spacing between paragraphs.  I find that format easier to read than the way this book has been laid out.   In addition, there is also a lot more hyphenation of words than I felt was needed.  For example, when there is a page with a very narrow column of text next to a picture, many words on the right side of this column were hyphenated.  While it was grammatically correct to hyphenate, I feel the layout could have been improved to remove them.  Too much hyphenation does make the book less readable.
0307269981|3.0|While reading The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo I kept referring back to the family tree in order to keep the characters straight.  The sequel, The Girl That Played with fire I was lost after the author threw in the Swedish Detective Bureau.  Not only could I not keep the characters straight but I couldn't get the gender right.<br />It was like reading Tolstoy. Too many Nordic townships, lighthouses, villages, islands, and while I enjoyed the sophistication of reading an European novel I<br />had to struggle with the thirty or more of the good and bad guys.

1400032717|4.0|The protagonist is that of a young teenage boy - Christopher Boone - who cannot bear to be touched, dislikes the colours yellow and brown, can't eat his food if they're touching on the plate but is a veritable math genius.  This is the first book I've read which gives some information (from the perspective of the autistic person) of the workings of the brain of someone with autism. Christopher holds an incredible amount of facts in his brain, which sometimes gets overloaded like a computer and crashes. To relieve this feeling he has a compulsion to count, do quadratic equations and sometimes groan.  A truly unbelievable plot!
0385504225|3.0|Its light easy reading, its often interesting, and I do enjoy the roller coaster like thrill chase that is going on in the book...but be warned....in the last 100 of so pages, the book jumps the shark in a HUGE way. It was moving along nicely and then became completely ludicrous. Still, a fun, decent enough read

0783231032|5.0|What can you say about this movie that hasn't been said?  This movie is pure comedy from start to finish.  The all star cast is probably one of the greatest generations of comedic actors which we will ever see on film.  If you haven't seen this spoof on America's reaction to Pearl Harbor and entering WWII, don't pass it up - it will have you rolling from the opening scene to the credits.
0439023491|5.0|When The Hunger Games came out last year, I devoured the book in one sitting and wanted more when I was through.  When I finally had a copy of Catching Fire in my hands, I blocked off a large chunk of time, expecting it to be as much of a page-turner as the first book.<br /><br />Not quite.<br /><br />I did enjoy Catching Fire, but when Katniss and Peeta return to District 12, the danger and action that made the first book such a compelling read are just memories.  True, Katniss still faces some danger, as she has become a figurehead for a rebellion she knows nothing about. But daily survival isn't really an issue anymore.  Instead, Katniss is trying to balance her growing feelings for Peeta with her already strong feelings for Gale. Just when it appears that a love triangle is Katniss's biggest problem, the Capitol changes the rules, and both Katniss and Peeta are thrown back into the Game, and this time the stakes are even greater.<br /><br />What really made the book for me was the twist at the end.  It came out of nowhere, and now I can't wait to get my hands on the last book in the trilogy!
0385504225|2.0|I bought the book.  I took it to the beach.  I was happy.    Not.   This is a sad product for someone who has written a number of interesting novels.

B001GCUO1Q|2.0|I waited to see this until it was on DVD because I had had my serious doubts about this movie, largely due to what I had heard as well as the lingering bad taste X-Men 3: The Last Stand had put in my mouth.  I pop this movie in to watch with a friend, and I am instantly regretting my decision.  This movie does not take itself, the characters/history, or the viewers seriously.  I must admit though, this movie is kinder to the history of the characters than The Last Stand was.  The character most badly mauled in this was Deadpool, who coincidentally was the coolest in the early part of the movie, and probably had the most chance for an awesome future.  Instead the director/writer/morons in charge decided it would be a good idea to introduce some stupid plot twist involving Wolverine's love life and family and whatnot.  The plot in this movie can be, and should be, ignored, as the only things the movie have to offer are some decent special effects, though even then they are somewhat hokey.  If you hate Deadpool, Wolverine, or any of the characters in this movie, then I recommend it thoroughly, otherwise stay away!

0061766089|4.0|In \\"Change By Design\\", Mr. Brown passionately argues the contribution of design thinkers to innovative solutions in every walk of life including for profit, non-profit, and charitable goods and services.  All innovative companies would greatly benefit from the work of design thinkers.  \\"Innovation needs to be coded into the DNA of a company if it is to have large-scale, long-term impact.\\" (p. 171)  \\"In addition to incremental projects that secure a company's base, it is vital to pursue evolutionary projects that stretch that base in new directions... The Prius is an example of this type of evolutionary innovation.\\" (p. 163)    It's easier for Companies with designers and/or design thinkers on staff to transform their culture to an innovative one.  The service and manufacturing sectors will find it more difficult to make this transition because their design efforts are typically outsourced.    Mr. Brown defines a design thinker as one who possesses a talent for balancing technical, commercial, and human considerations.  Design thinking is a powerful approach to innovation \\"that is effective, broadly accessible, that can be integrated into all aspects of business and society.\\"  The tools of design thinkers are \\"getting out into the world to be inspired by people, using prototyping to learn with our hands, creating stories to share our ideas, joining forces with people from other disciplines.\\" (p. 227)    \\"Change By Design\\" is a tough read at times, and the interesting accounts of innovative products developed by design thinkers were brief and left a lot to be desired.  On numerous occasions, I found myself using supplemental material from sources outside of the book to learn more about specific products mentioned in the book, e.g. \\"The Aquaduct, a human powered tricycle designed to filter drinking water while transporting it.\\"  In the introduction, Mr. Brown asserts \\"design thinking flourishes in a rich culture of storytelling.\\"  Mr. Brown delivered on the quantity ofstories, but unfortunately, not on depth.  Nevertheless, the ten chapters in this book delivered on the promise to \\"provide a worthwhile insight into the world of design thinking and the potential it has for us to create meaningful change.\\"

This is the first autobiography, I have read, that has ever done that.    I have more respect for Craig Ferguson for being brave to share dark, personal details of his life with the world. His ability to come back to life after a catastrophic lifestyle is praiseworthy.    Craig, if you are reading this, congratulations and thank you.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Possibly the most brilliantly written screenplay of Tarantino's since Pulp, but some of the scenes should have been cut or reduced for length. Yet, doing that, would have cut out some of the best and most creative parts. Too much of the movie was taken up by conversations across a table. I understand why some of these scenes weren't trimmed though, because the dialogue is so sharp and well done. Yet, by the fourth or fifth 20 minute scene of people sitting at a table talking, you wished they'd get to some more nazi smashing.<br /><br />Brad Pitt rejuvenates his career, showing his range and comedic timing and the smash a Nazi fantasy works to perfection, as long as you know what you're coming to see.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me, other than the length of some of the talky scenes, was the hard to believe change of attitude of the most hated character in the film, Col. Hans Landa, played by Christop Waltz. His pursuit of jews throughout the film is its backbone, yet he too quickly leaves his goals on the ground behind him.<br /><br />Inglourious [...]is a well-acted and well-written slam fest that could have been shorter, but ultimately does something that most have feared to do to this extent, turn history into fantasy.

031604461X|2.0|The nicest thing I can say about this book is LET DOWN!!    I got the audiobooks in this series.  The problem I have with them is that Ilyana Kadushin, the reader, basically speaks in a monotone and does nothing to keep me into the story; I guess I got spoiled to Jim Dale reading the Harry Potter series.      Bella really got on my nerves in the first and third book, and now in this one.  I could sympathize with her in the second--after all, who hasn't loved and lost?--and I wanted her to grow out of her experience.  I really wanted her to GROW UP, not become some character 180 degrees from when we first met her.  This girl got it all--preternatural beauty, the fairytale wedding, a honeymoon to envy, a rich, beautiful man who treated her like a queen, a set of in-laws with whom she didn't fight, and a buddy out of the guy whose heart she broke over and over.  Let's not forget the baby that didn't keep her up nights and need diaper changes.  Everything just turned out hunky dory, didn't it?  WHY?    I hated the way Edward, who came across as the strong, sexy knight in shining armor in the first book, was reduced in this one to being basically a puddle of whine.  Same for Jacob, who was basically reduced to a toy poodle for the baby.  The one redeeming light for Jacob was that he came into his own when he challenged Sam and formed his own pack--then we learn that he's not a werewolf after all, but a shapeshifter.  LET DOWN!!    I enjoyed reading the books, partly because I like to read and partly because, in spite of Bella being whiny to the extreme, I was hoping I'd get to watch what was the prelude to Bella's and Edward's relationship developing and growing.  I was glad when I finished the series, though, because I knew I didn't have to hold out the hope of finding what I needed from it, only to be let down again.  I like the premise of the stories, but by this one, it seemed as if Stephenie Meyer just wanted to hurry and wrap it all up, and it showed here.

Combine the old school music(Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extiction, So Far So Good) with modern sounds  that we can hear on albums  such The System Has Failed and  United Abominations. Songs like Dialect of Chaos , This Day We Fight!, 44 minutes, Bodies,1320, Headcrusher and EndGame are amazing!!.The other songs are consistent with the rest of the album    In the past, every  megadeth's new album was referenced with the 3  classic albums of megadeth(Peace Sells , Rust In Peace, Countdown to Extinction ) as  the most highest level that megadeth has played before and let me tell you something..This album is now one of that references of megadeth's highest perfomances. And every new  work in the future has to be referenced with Endgame too.    Megadeth brings within EndGame to his fans a  new and bright hope about future works to come.    If Chris will make forget Marty Friedman? ...no as Marty didn't with Poland, they have very different styles. Marty will be always Marty. But Chris now could be a reference like Friedman and Poland  But his works on songs like 44 minutes, EndGame ,1320 and How the Story ends  are just amazing!
B000M53GM2|5.0|This one had it all, a top-notch Bond, great locations, sets, action, and best of all, one of the best Bond women, Izabella Scorupco. Wow, what a beauty, what an attractive character, makes me proud to be Polish (Izabella's Polish too)! That's two straight movies I've seen with knockout Polish female leads, check out Dagmara (last name escapes me) in The Count of Monte Cristo. I've always thought Polish women are some of the most beautiful and sexy. What's cool, I didn't know anything about either of them till after I'd seen the movies. It's always nice when your notions are validated that way.
074357818X|3.0|This is a good audio production. Anne Heche does a very good job. Many of the scenes are taken from a radio broadcast and she does that part perfectly. So we get a good range of voices from Anne.<br /><br />Now the story itself is one of the weaker Stephen King stories out there. It deals with a very scary proposition - losing ones daughter while hiking through the forest and she is lost for days. But what makes it not so scary is the overabundance of baseball and in particular the Boston Red Sox. Now if you love baseball and the Red Sox you'll love the story.<br /><br />As mentioned it deals with a small girl who gets lost in a National Forest while hiking with her mother and brother. She  tries to find the path again, and cannot and as a result she is lost for many days in the forest. She has to deal with food and water, and she has to deal with keeping sane and not breaking down. As she gets further into the forest she starts hallucinating, brought on by her fear of being lost, what keeps her sane is the radio that she has where she can listen to the Red Sox every night, and her hero Tom Gordon: The closer of the Red Sox. She starts hallucinating about Tom too, but it is that hallucination of Tom that helps her get through.<br /><br />This is a very short story for a Stephen King novel, and worth the read, while it's not one of Kings better works. The reasoning is it won't take a lot of your time, and it's still not bad, just a little too much baseball in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing of note: this is not a horror story, it's more a suspense story.
0312370849|5.0|This is a great book.  Well written--you won't be able to put it down. It's also a quick read. Well worth it.  Price is great too! :-)
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|Stunning, looks great!  The only complaint is that because they redid the original effects (which for the most part I hate and don't watch) they decided that they sound not do ANYTHING to the original effects.  So you go from a stunning picture with the actors to the effects shots which are full of scratches, dirt and dust very evident on the film.  At least they could have cleaned that part up.  Why not go all the way?  In any event I still would rather see those then the remastered effects.  Just a little grip but for the price you cant beat this set.  I paid [...]  bucks for a two episode DVD when they were first released so this is a real bargain AND in high def.
0684830485|4.0|This is the first Hemingway book I've read, and I recommend it. For Whom the Bell Tolls covers a period of three full days during the Spanish Civil War, following (primarily) a young American professor of Spanish working as a guerrilla explosives expert on the Communist side (although, as we discover, not a Communist himself). The book is well-written, as one would expect of a classic, although not quite as terse as I expected given Hemingway's reputation... but certainly missing the flowery language of many earlier classics, and I suppose that's the point.<br /><br />On the merits of the story alone, this is a good book. It's a war story, but don't read it for the action scenes, which are few and far between--far more time is spent getting to know the characters, their lifestyle (living in a cave in the mountains behind fascist lines), and their relationships. There's some backstory dealing with the start of the war and some philosophizing on life, love, the morality of killing in wartime, and so forth. Philosophizing in a novel generally bores me, but kudos to Hemingway for writing these passages the way a person's internal voice (well... mine anyway...) would actually sound; Robert Jordan's thought processes sound like they come from a rational, self-aware sort of man in a war zone rather than an author writing essays in the comfort of his home. There are a couple windows on the \\"larger picture\\" as well; my favorite section of the book deals with the myriad difficulties one of the guerrillas has getting into and through territory controlled by his own side.<br /><br />The characters here are quite well-developed, especially the protagonist... although his love interest, Maria, seems like little more than a vehicle for masculine wish-fulfillment most of the time (except for the priceless scene where she informs him that she's too sore for sex). At least there is another, much better-developed female character to balance that out. Descriptions, while not flowery, are quite vivid. I learned a bit about Spanish culture and history, although my feeling is that Hemingway was writing for an audience who already knew the basics of the war; his story is a microcosm of the conflict, requiring readers to do more research to really understand it.<br /><br />I would have liked to see a bit more resolution at the end (who survived the day, at least?), but my only real gripe is Hemingway's direct and sometimes inaccurate rendering of Spanish dialogue. His goal--trying to give readers a feel for the Spanish language--is reasonable, but it results in characters saying stilted things that sound ridiculous in English, and sometimes are just plain incorrect. For instance, they say \\"rare\\" when they mean \\"strange,\\" that they don't want to \\"molest\\" someone when they want to avoid annoying them (\\"raro\\" in Spanish means \\"strange,\\" and \\"molestar\\" means \\"to annoy\\"... one would think that a writer like Hemingway must understand the concept of false cognates). And while I understand his use of the \\"thou\\" form in an attempt to show the difference between formal and informal forms of address in Spanish, he uses it inconsistently, and statements like \\"I love thee\\" in a novel set in the 20th century are just bizarre. For me the translation quickly became annoying and distracting, jolting me out of the story as I found myself translating characters' statements into Spanish to make sense of them.<br /><br />Still, if you can get past what another reviewer has aptly called the \\"goofy English,\\" this is certainly a worthy read. Lovers of classics are likely to approve all of Hemingway's editorial decisions, and for the rest, this is a fun way to get to know one of the most famous literary novelists of the 20th century. Even if you didn't like classics in school, this one is worth a shot.I learned a bit about Spanish culture and history, although my feeling is that Hemingway was writing for an audience who already knew the basics of the war; his story is a microcosm of the conflict, requiring readers to do more research to really understand it.

0307266303|2.0|The first significant limitation of this book is the statistics on injuries from high tech running shoes. I give the author credit for citing real studies. What is weak is the confusion between association and causation. The author describes the research as finding that there is a link between the amount spent on high tech running shoes and injuries. Clearly, high tech shoes may be purchased by injury prone runners to forestall injuries. Conversely, and this is the case made in this book, high tech running shoes may lead to more injuries because of the way people run in the shoes. I can't tell if the original studies are sloppy (not adequately controlling for age, injury history, etc.) or whether the author fails to be sensitive to this distinction.     The second flaw with this book is the writing style. It is full of the gee whiz prose common to 2000 word travelogues about a backpacking trip on Maui. It falls flat in a book-length exposition. The characters are flat; the narrative thread gets lost.    On the redeeming side, the author does describe some very interesting people and events. Overall this book is disappointing. A better writer with a stronger science background could have taken this material to a first-class level.
1881273873|5.0|This book was an excellent buy. It was purchased as a book that we were going to use for a dicussion at our church. Most of us who picked it up, were barely able to put it down. It was interesting. It talked alott about How you communicate love to others and how others receive your love. It was wonderfully written and had excellent examples to illustrate each of the points being made in the book. I would recommend for all, married, single, with children or no children. ALL can relate to this book.
0380730405|4.0|Since I had always loved the Hitchcock film, I decided to read the book upon which it was based. For whatever reason--somewhat to the dismay of those around me at the time--this work brought out the (former) English major in me.<br /><br />At first, I thought the writing was laughable. For instance, I found the following statement highly ironic: \\"I have had enough melodrama in this life, and would willingly give my five senses if they could ensure us our present peace and security.\\" Eventually, I think I became so enveloped in the story that the chintzy style became secondary.<br /><br />I failed to really see the romance in this, though. Or perhaps, I should say that I did not see romance between individuals. The underlying theme of this book, I felt, was a lack of identity. The second Mrs. de Winter (whose name, by the way, is never revealed) was always comparing herself to the first Mrs. de Winter. She became obsessed with attempting not to disturb the life established by her predecessor. She had no spine, no opinions of herself. As for her \\"love\\" life with her husband, through most of the book she compared herself to her husband's spaniel. It wasn't until she began to learn the truth about Rebecca that the second Mrs. de Winter showed any character at all.<br /><br />Mr. de Winter was also plagued by a lack of identity. Come to find out, his reason for marrying Rebecca was to keep up this \\"ideal\\"of Manderley. He let his life be led by a lying, manipulative, though highly organized she-thing in order to maintain this facade of posh, idyllic country living. And, symbolically enough, once Rebecca had been destroyed completely and finally put to rest, that which she symbolized also had been destroyed.<br /><br />This novel is certainly gothic, but like I said, I failed to see the romance. It's a fairly quick, fairly interesting read (if you can get past the schmaltz). But, don't feel guilty if you just want to watch the movie.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|While not exactly true to the absolutely fabulous book by Elizabeth Gaskell, this is a great movie.  I loved the visuals in the factory and Richard Armitage is wonderful.  I'm not sure why, but they felt the need to take away a lot of the strength of the main character, who in the book is managing so much and all without anyone knowing how much she bears.  I suppose that's hard to show in film?  At any rate, read the book, then watch the movie - it throws a very nice little addition on at the end that promises to please.

0385504225|2.0|The ending sucked.      Sorry to be so abrupt, but I appreciate that this is a long review, and I appreciate that you might not finish it, and unlike some other book reviewers, I can't, in good conscience, discuss The Lost Symbol without bringing up the end. That's unfortunate for Dan Brown because the first 450 pages of his new thriller were a ton of fun. They were filled with all the elements that Brown fans (myself included) have come to love and expect: cryptic puzzles, fast-moving aircrafts, and dull historical locations made exciting.     But the ending sucked.    Or maybe it only seemed like it sucked; maybe if Robert Langdon, the seemingly omniscient professor protagonist from Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code were to read The Lost Symbol and peel back its layers, he'd discover that Brown didn't drop the ball at the book's end; he covered up the book's flaws until then.     But they had to come out sooner or later.     Yes, Professor of symbology Rober Langdon's is back, and he's still solving puzzles, and his dialogue is still stiffer than the Washington monument: \\"This idea that there exists some kind of ancient knowledge that can imbue men with great power...I simply can't take it seriously.\\" But the dialogue is par for the course--\\"the course\\" encompassing not only Brown's earlier works, but also the genre in which he writes.     As flat as Langdon's words sound, the professor has actually grown more human/less godlike in the past five years; it now takes him more than, oh, four seconds to solve a nearly impossible riddle. Langdon's external life too has changed too, since his days running through he Louvre: \\"Ever since his experiences in Europe over the last several years, Langdon's unwanted celebrity had made him a magnet for nutcases...Grail fanatics had followed the media coverage closely, some connecting the dots and believing Langdon was now privy to secret information regarding the Holy Grail--perhaps even its location.\\"     It doesn't take aHarvard professor to see that Brown is talking about himself there. Ditto for this exchange between professor Langdon and one of his readers:    \\"My book group read your book about the sacred feminine and the church! What a delicious scandal that one caused! You do enjoy putting the fox in the henhouse!\\"    Langdon smiled. \\"Scandal wasn't really my intention.\\"    Unlike The Da Vinci Code, The Lost Symbol won't ruffle feathers, let alone cause a \\"delicious scandal.\\" The book's featured secret society, the Freemasons, are politically benign. (Sure, some individual Masons hold political power, but their society membership is unconnected, substantively, to their politics.) Apparently Brown's new villain, a transformation-obsessed tattooed bodybuilder named Mal'akh, didn't get the memo--he believes the Masons are withholding the secrets to the universe from the rest of mankind.     The Lost Symbol's plot kicks off when Mal'akh kidnaps professor Langdon's friend Peter. Mal'ach tells Langdon he'll free Peter once he (Langdon) solves the Freemason's puzzles and discovers their secrets. So Langdon and Peter's sister Katherine (a \\"Noetics scientist\\" [i.e., a person who's convinced herself that Psychokinesis is a legitimate science and tries to convince others of the same {and probably will convince Brown's less skeptical readers, given 1) the authority with which she speaks and 2) the reverence her brother Peter and, disappointingly, professor Langdon afford her}]) run around Washington DC trying to solve Masonic puzzles.     Except for when they're trying not to solve them. See, Peter (the guy Langdon is trying to rescue) told Langdon not to unlock the mysteries of the Freemasons, and Langdon wants desperately to respect his friend's wishes, and Langdon's ambivalence severely cuts into the book's momentum. For example, look to this dialogue between professor Langson and Katherine:    \\"He stood poised, pencil in hand, and yet...strangely, after all this enthusiasm, he seemedto hesitate.    `Robert?'    He turned to her, his expression one of trepidation. `Are you sure we want to do this? Peter expressly--`    `Robert, if you don't want to decipher this engraving, then I will.'\\"    The thing that keeps The Lost Symbol moving along is Brown's implicit promise that in the end, a tangible secret will be uncovered (like the one in Da Vinci Code about Jesus having a kid). Langdon keeps asking, Are you sure we're not speaking in metaphors here? Are you sure we're dealing with something tangible?, and everybody (Peter, Mal'ach, the CIA) keeps assuring him, No metaphors here; we're being literal.    Quasi-spoiler alert: Langdon's suspicions were well founded.     On a similar note, for a couple hundred pages, Mal'akh and the CIA insist the stakes couldn't be higher, so Langdon (along with the reader) is led to believe that if he (Langdon) doesn't solve the Freemasons puzzles, the world as we know will crumble to pieces for some reason or other. (Or is it that will the world crumble if he does solve them? One of the two.)    Turns out the potential danger in question is something that could be fixed by a focused PR campaign.      When Brown got to the end of the story, I suspect he thought to himself Oops! I haven't made the stakes high enough and I haven't revealed a tangible secret. I've got to throw in something that will rival Da Vinci Code in scope. And then, in an attempt to artificially raise the stakes, Brown throws a Hail Mary pass in the form of a Platonic dialogue about the nature of God. It comes off as ham-fisted and borderline preachy.    I said that I enjoyed the book's first 450 pages, and I did. At the time. But the book left a bitter taste in my mouth that grows bitterer and bitterer as time goes by. So here's what I recommend: buy a copy of The Lost Symbol, read the first 450 pages, and then throw the book away. Yes, you could try to think up your own satisfying ending, but if Brown couldn't think of one--and believe me, he couldn't--the odds are against you. No offense.     I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news--believe me, I wanted to like this one too.

B001FB4W16|4.0|This is the first set of Blu-Ray DVDs I've purchased, and I must say that the quality if superb.  You really feel like you are watching the actors in your living room.  With that being said, it's well worth the extra money to purchase Blu-Ray DVDs if you have the player.    This is a great first season of True Blood (I liked it better than the 2nd season, just because it focuses more on character development and personal issues, versus season 2 which focuses on a CRAZY story!)  The only part that was missing from the DVD set is the lack of special features.  Other than commentary (mostly done by Lafayette) and a few extra ad-type visuals, there are no behind the scenes, no bloopers or anything like that.  Hopefully the 2nd season will contain these benefits.

It doesn't matter how you get a hold of this series, but I urge you to watch this masterpiece.  It is enthralling, witty, imaginative, and like nothing I have ever seen.  You won't be able to stop watching, and that's exactly how a tv show should be...addicting!

B001LJWKKC|5.0|They don't sell like they used to anymore, but \\"I'm Yours\\" made history as the longest standing song in the Billboard Hot 100 since Leann Rimes back in '98, and the song is still on the chart! In reviewing the original album I was horrified with this new unoriginal, sleepy Mraz, that just didn't feel right with the reggae, and studio productions this time around. \\"I'm Yours\\" especially irked me since it had such as long stay in radio, and like the rest of the album, it just didn't feel sincere. Enter Director Quintin Tarantino, who recently gave a list of songs he listened to during Inglorious Basterds. One of his favorite songs of the time was \\"I'm Yours,\\" but not the Hawaiian album version, but the original demo/acoustic version. The feel of the song was intimate, and most importantly, sincere to both the lyrics and the setting. Upon searching for where the track came from, I stumbled across this bonus disc, a compilation of a series of EP's Mraz released to promote the studio album. In my opinion, what was supposed to be a promotion outshines the original in almost every aspect, from musical styling, to lyrics, every single song is made better.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />I'm Yours<br />A Beautiful Mess<br />Details In The Fabric<br />Dynamo of Volition<br />Love For A Child<br /><br />Mraz plays sings every note to sweet perfection, and his guitar playing truly makes the album. And while it's not prominent all the time, the lyrics really take the center stage in songs like \\"Love For A Child.\\" \\"Mudhouse/Gypsy MC,\\" which didn't make it to the album harkens back to his \\"Live At Eagles Ball\\" album, where he raps through his acoustic strumming. That's the Jason I first fell in love with, and it works amazingly in this live setting.<br /><br />Granted, not everything is absolutely perfect, \\"Coyotes,\\" which was awful on the album, is still a bad idea here. And yes, there are a couple tracks that did not make the final studio album, one of these being \\"Man Gave Names To All The Animals.\\" The song is as stupid as its title, and basically compares people in a club to animals, including one that snorts, one that gives milk, and one that wasn't so small, wasn't too big, so he called it a pig. The innuendos you could think of there... Oh Jason, you're so much better than writing and singing that.<br /><br />Overall, I wish they'd release this bonus disc as least an alternative to the studio album because it is just SO amazing. Mraz burns it up on almost every track with emotion, love and intimacy. I may still miss his beginning days, but this bonus disc is an excellent direction for Mraz to go in, and it outshines the studio album. Not to mention, there isn't a crappy Colbie Caillat duet here, which is always a plus for me. Buy it, or learn all the songs and sing them to a lover, either way you're getting shorties.<br /><br />Studio Disc: 1/5 Stars<br />Bonus/EP Compilation Disc: 5/5 stars<br />Real Score: 4.5 (The Bonus Disc Is Worth The Price of Admission Alone)tupid as its title, and basically compares people in a club to animals, including one that snorts, one that gives milk, and one that wasn't so small, wasn't too big, so he called it a pig.

B000T2OMX0|5.0|... listening to the six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello by Johann Sebastian Bach, and if you're a cellist you'll very likely spend much of your lifetime playing them. At one time or another, I've heard most of the better-known recordings of them - Casals, Fournier, Rostropovitch, Ma, and other 'modern' cellists; Bylsma, Wispelwey, Isserlis among the baroque cellists. For the moment, I have two favorite performances and I refuse to choose between them: the recording by Ophelie Gaillard which I reviewed a few weeks ago and this recording by Jean-Guihen Queyras. Both performances are are \\"historically informed' interpretations, at least in bowing technique and rhythmic sensibilities..<br /><br />Jean-Guihen Queyras has such magnificent technique that one is tempted to place a crown of hyperbole on his brow and declare him the 'greatest living cellist.' He's astonishingly polished on both modern and baroque cello; he brings the conservatory mastery of the former to the latter, and the HIP musicality of the latter to the former. His recordings include not only the Bach suites but also the two Haydn concertos, the Schubert 'Arpeggione' Sonata for Cello and Piano along with works by Berb and Webern,  and the Dvorak Concerto and the Dumka Trios. Every one of these performances is at or near the apex of brilliance.<br /><br />It's Queyras's virtuosity - his flawless tuning, his effortless fingering, his magnificent control of timbre - that make these cello suites vivid. Queyras never over-interprets; in any repertoire, he liberates the notes of music to sing their own song. The cello he plays here has an exceptionally balanced and mellow timbre, and the recording quality is superb. The 'competition' these days is down to two: Queyras and Ophelie Gaillard, whose interpretation of the suites is more gutsy and darker but almost equally virtuosic. I have one clear preference, for Gaillard's complex, compelling performance of Suite #6 on her five-string cello piccolo with gut strings. Otherwise, I'm totally, thoroughly, irreversibly convinced by whichever of the two I'm hearing at the moment.I'm totally, thoroughly, irreversibly convinced by whichever of the two I'm hearing at the moment.

1439157383|1.0|I have never felt compelled to write a review for amazon, but I have also never been so bitterly disappointed reading a book in my life. Let me clarify one thing, I had to read this book for a Sociology class I'm taking. I remembered seeing previews for the film and thought it looked average, if not a little sappy. It was a relief to get to read, what I thought would be a light easy book for class. This book is easy, it is light, but the thought of having to read any more than the first three chapters kills me. This is probably one of the most poorly written books I have read in the past 10 years, and I'm only 20. Picoult writes from different characters perspectives, but nothing about the writing style varies, it is the same sap, the same young teen level writing throughout, Faulkner she is not. What I've read of this book is stalked full of cliches, cheese, and manufactured emotion. I have literally cried over this book, but only because I have to continue wasting my time on it for class. I got to a line in the third or fourth chapter that was to the effect of \\"my daughter taught me you could cry in your sleep\\" and I have yet to pick it back up, completely dreading the inane drivel that is to come. Maybe I haven't given this book a fair shot, maybe I should actually finish it before writing a review but my god, this is the worst thing I have ever picked up, let alone bought. Please, if you have any sense of what good writing is, if you actually want something worth your time, if you want a book that contains more than soap opera, lifetime, hallmark sentences do not buy this book. It is not even worth taking up space on your library card.
0385504225|3.0|This is definitely action-packed and filled with symbology, just like The DaVinci Code but that's about all that can be said in its favor.     The plot is outrageous, the plot twists contrived, and the underlying premise is ridiculously Homo sapiens-centric and self-indulgent.  I raced through this book only to find an ending that did not satisfy. To me it felt like the entire meat of the book (at least its intellectual premise) was contained in the first hundred pages and the rest was just tacked on to make a contrived roller coaster ride. I'm thinking this would have been much better as a novella.

B00004TJKI|5.0|This movie kind of snuck up on me and by the ending I felt as if I had been baited and hooked. Preminger was teasing us all along by taking advantage of the fact that we all aproach a movie by early on picking out the bad guys and the good guys. Naturally we all see Jimmy Stewart as the good guy hero who we prepare to root for from beginning to end. But during the last few scenes, in which a drunken Lee Remick chases Jimmy up a law house stairway with a girdle in hand and then the very last shot where Jimmy finds Lee's shoes in a garbage can, it is then I realize that I have been conned. I was aware of the fact that Lee and her murderer husband Ben Gazarra were somewhat unsympathetic from the very start but I felt certain that somehow they would exhibit redeeming qualities at movies end, but no way! Preminger only reinforced how truely awful they really were and Jimmy is only a scheming lawyer out to revive his career with a drunken sidekick who proves very helpful. When you think about it, this is how the law and the world really do work - OJ Simson case in point. Who would have thought that in 1959 a movie this cynical, which doesn't really even feel cynical, would pack such a real world punch as this one does?<br />  Call me a naive country bumkin but this movie really amazed me and I can't believe that more people aren't taken aback the way I was. Preminger really plays with your head and hides his true intentions until by movies end you really feel like a fool for not having suspected what he was really up too. Can we have more discussion about this or are we all so jaded that nothing surprises us anymore?
0385504225|2.0|There is much being written about the problems with Dan Brown's writing and they are valid; I have enjoyed his ability to tell a good story though. With \\"angels\\" and \\"da Vinci\\" there was fast pacing, impossible situations somehow escaped. It's pure escapism. But boy, \\"symbol\\" really kind of fell apart. I found myself getting toward the end and coming close to tossing the book because it was all so obvious and superficial. The big \\"twist\\" , the character reveal that I assume was supposed to shock was one that was clear from early on in the book. He has a tendency to over describe, over explain and this time it revealed this big reveal much too soon. I can't help but feel tightening up the writing could tighten the plot and be more suspenseful.   Of the three book, this is, in my opinion, the least of the three. If they make a movie from this one maybe leaving some stuff out would make for a better movie (unlike \\"Angels\\" where I sat through the movie saying \\"no\\", \\"it wasn't like that\\" and being irritated by the elimination of one or two of the book's significant characters.)  The area of Noetic Sciences is fascinating, really exists, and continues to reveal that the more we learn the less we seem to know. I appreciate Brown \\"delving\\" into this area of understanding even if mangling it a bit.  On reflection I'm not sorry I read the book, I just wish it had been several degrees better.

B0025KVLT2|2.0|This is for the 2009 stereo remaster.  I'm sorry, but the sound is horrible.  I have thrilled to the '09 remasters of Abbey Road, MMT, AHDN, and The Beatles.  So I was expecting to swoon when I put on Rubber Soul this evening.  Just the opposite, folks.  It is muddy.  Unlike the newfound clarity and sonority of Paul's bass on those other 4 albums, Rubber Soul sounds like the guitars and vocals are in front of me and the bass and drums are in the next room.  Even on Michelle, which is so clean you'd think the bass would ring out, the bass is the least discernible element of the song.  And there is no bite at all to the drums on You Won't See Me.  Contrast this with Something, Here Comes the Sun, The End (!), Penny Lane, the first half of I Am The Walrus, Revolution 1, Dear Prudence, Long Long Long, and every track on AHDN, where the bass resonates in your chest and the drums are punchy and exquisite, giving the rest of the instruments a firm and distinct foundation to shine.      Perhaps worst of all, I had to strain to pick out the bass line on Nowhere Man.  Nowhere Man!!  With its jaunty bass line rhythmically reminiscent of I Saw Her Standing There.  And the bass is AWOL on the '09 Rubber Soul remaster.      How can this be?  I know I've heard these bass lines more clearly than this.  My LP has been packed deeply away in a box for 20 years, and to my horror my 1987 CD is missing from its case and I've never downloaded it to iTunes, so I have no other reference, but I know those bass lines in Rubber Soul have always sounded better than on the '09 remaster.  Haven't they?  If they can clean up the sonic muddle that was MMT, they can certainly bring new life to Rubber Soul.  But they didn't.    One star for the sound.  One star for the package.
0385504225|1.0|To tell you the truth I wanted to know something about masons, described even in a fictional form.   And at the beginning it was kind of interesting, but then, literally horrors began.  Character undeveloped, plot is week, and preaching of a New Age stuff.  Stop it!! If you had any real knowledge of any religion described you wouldn't mix them all together.  The book is simple abuse of a reader intelligence.
0385504225|3.0|All in all, this was an enjoyable book.  However, I had a few problems with it.  First of all, I think the reaction to the video in today's world would not be anything near what Brown tried to tell us it would be.  And, some of the twists were not that hard to figure out.  I had the main one (not trying to give anything away) figured out less than halfway through.  It's a good read, but not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it.  obviously, all of the hype was to sell as many as possible, and I suppose it succeeded at that.  For the next Dan Brown book, I plan to sign up for it at the library.  I'm still annoyed at myself for buying both the hard copy and the kindle edition for my iPhone so my husband and I could read it at the same time.  All in all, Brown tries to make major issues out of things that aren't issues at all, and follows it up with a weak, syrupy sweet ending.  I really expected better and was disappointed.
0385504225|3.0|I agree with most of the negative reviews yet I still give this book 4 stars. Why? Because The Lost Symbol succeeds at what it is - a cheese filled, page turning, diversion meant to be devoured by folks traveling on planes, trains, etc. Yeah, it's not great literature.<br /><br />Dan Brown is the William Hung of storytellers, the Frank Stallone of...of...umm...putting words on paper.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is very predictable. I'm sure he has a \\"Dan Brown Story Template\\" on his PC. This book has all of Dan brown's greatest hits. Famous artist like Da Vinci? Hey, there's Albrecht Durer. Secret society like the Templars? How about the Freemasons! And what about the codes and symbols that must be solved within a certain period of time or else the world goes ka-boom? Like you really had to ask!<br /><br />A big beef I have with this book is its anti-climactic climax. I won't give anything away but shall simply state that the book goes on way too long after the crisis has been [spoiler alert] averted.<br /><br />A positive for this book? It's a very fast read. Heck, some of the chapters are barely a page in length.<br /><br />So, if you want something mindless and fast to read while you're stuck at an airport, or train station, or locked away in the basement of a crazed Mason bent on destroying the world, then this book is for you.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Anyone who has read previous Dan Brown novels is aware that he fills his work with an abundance of well researched facts that he then weaves a facinating story around.  What happened here?  Facts...absolutely, well researched...no doubt, facinating story...not so much!  I never thought I'd have trouble getting through a Dan Brown novel, but I found myself struggling with The Lost Symbol.  I continued reading hoping for the \\"big reveal...the big ending\\" but was sadly disappointed.  I can only \\"hope\\" that if Robert Langdon makes another appearance, he is rewarded with a better more exciting vehicle.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers of Catan is that critically acclaimed board game, and for a reason.  Game play is intricate enough for adults, but simple enough that children can play and have a good time.<br /><br />A short description:  Settles of Catan centers around four \\"countries\\" attempting to settle the mythical island of Catan.  Players build settlements and cities through the island, vieing for resources to build their civilization.  To get these resources, players take turns rolling dice.  If the number on the dice corresponds to location on the board you have a settlement built next to you claim one of that resource.  Trading and long term strategy is critical to win in settlers, but there is a large dose of luck in getting good dice rolls as well.<br /><br />The game is won when a player has achieved 10 \\"victory points.\\"  Something determined by number of cities/settlements, as well as a few other special conditions.<br /><br />This is a fun game for all, and requires a fair bit of strategic thinking, but it isn't as intense mentally as a game such as chess.  For true strategy fans I'd say this game might be simplistic.  In fact, I am really not a fan of the dice rolling mechanic used to distribute resources, because it you can lose completely to unlucky dice rolls early in the game (the most critical stage).<br /><br />If you don't take it too seriously, and just want some fun, this game is great.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I'm not going to break down the album in long paragraphs, because there are plenty of other people who have done that in their reviews. I'm just going to tell you what you need to know. This album is very good, absolutely a 5 star effort. it maintains the high quality of In Absentia, Deadwing, and Fear of a Blank Planet, though it does not outdo them. The music is great, but there is a little more focus on atmosphere as opposed to full-band pieces, which I think is this album's most significant downfall: it's too short. It feels slightly rushed. They needed to balance out the ambiance with more actual playing. The band should have developed each track a little more, except for Time Flies, and made the album 10 or 15 minutes longer. Either that, or they should have figured out a way to incorporate the 4 separate songs into the Incident piece. At any rate, the moments when they do let loose are very gratifying and give you that feeling of spiritual connection.    If you're a Porcupine Tree fan, you'll love it, though maybe not as much as past efforts. If you're just getting into them, it may be hard to do that with this album. But regardless, I would recommend purchasing it.

0385504225|1.0|How Dissapointing! Being an ardent fan of Dan Brown and his character Robert Langdon, this was one of those few books I was really looking forward to. And what a let down.<br /><br />I really don't quite know how to put it any other way, but it appears as though the success and sensationalism of The Da Vinci Code & Angels and Demons has overwhelmed Mr. Brown's creative skills. For instead of writing what could have been a worthy addition to the Robert Langdon Series, he appears to have put his pen to paper with the intention of writing a screenplay for another movie as opposed to actually focussing on a good book.<br /><br />A pity though. For the subject matter of his choice this time around, really would have made a riveting read had the storyline been fleshed out more thoroughly as proven by Alan Moore's bestselling graphic novel 'From Hell'.  Mr. Brown should have paid more attention to better character development and actual twists in the tale. Instead, it appears he opted for excessive bloodshed and brutality, tragically under the misguided notion that a formula of that nature is key to a bestseller of a book and a blockbuster of a movie. Sadly Mr. Brown, I beg to differ.<br /><br />A wasted opportunity.<br /><br />0/10

0755322819|5.0|The Headline Review edition of \\"American Gods\\", by Neil Gaiman, is significantly changed from the edition that was published on June 19, 2001 and received so many nominations and won so many awards.  This edition was published on September 19th, of 2005, and includes the \\"Author's Preferred Text\\", which Gaiman explains in the introduction as being a combination of his original unedited text along with editorial corrections which he made to the trimmed down award winning version.  While I haven't read the original edition and thus I am unable to do a comparison, I can easily state that this new edition is an amazing work in and of itself.<br /><br />The idea that Gods didn't exist without man is not original, but Neil Gaiman takes it to a new level.  America is not only a melting pot for people, but for the Gods which they brought with them from all over the world, and those which the Native Americans created.  Nor does Gaiman stop there, for as technology and industry have in some respects taken on aspects of religion in American society, those too appear in this mythological epic as the old Gods and new Gods take on adversarial positions as the storm looms throughout most of the book.<br /><br />The hero of the book is Shadow, a man on the verge of being released from prison after serving his time is released a few days early because his wife has died in a car accident.  As a result, the life that Shadow expected to return to is gone, even more so when he finds out that the man who was going to give him a job has also died in the same accident.  At the same time, the mysterious Mr. Wednesday keeps turning up and is pursing hiring Shadow for a different type of job.  Shadow resists at first, but when it is clear that he has no other life to return to, he decides to take the job.  This is just the beginning of the adventure which will take Shadow on a mythological journey to a conflict between the Gods of the old world and the new Gods, i.e. industry, technology, etc., of the new world.<br /><br />One can hardly do justice to a book of this scope in a short review, but this 635 page novel is a blend of mythology, murder mystery, fantasy adventure, and horror.  There are a few extras as well, including an introduction to the \\"Author's Preferred Edition\\", an interview with Neil Gaiman, and some reading-group discussion questions, and a short essay titled \\"How Dare You?\\" by the author.  The extras are nice, but the novel is extraordinary.<br /><br />There are times when one reads a book which has won awards and they wonder what the people who give out the awards were thinking.  This is not one of those times.  The nominations include the 2002 World Fantasy Award, the 2002 British Fantasy Award, the 2002 British SF Award, the 2002 International Horror Guild Award, the 2002 Mythopoeic award for adult literature, finishing 3rd on the 2002 SF Site Poll for SF/Fantasy books, being nominated in 2003 and 2004 for the Italia Award for international novels, finishing 2nd both times, and being nominated for the 2004 Phantastik award for foreign novels.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Not much I can add that hasn't already been covered in the many fine reviews here, but the cinematography, music, wonderful performances all around and especially the inevitable, brilliantly gripping and compact climax cemented this one for me right at the top of Mr. Eastwood's impressive acting and directing canon.  Watching it again in '09 after not seeing it for a few years was quite enjoyable.  In fact, this one seems to improve with age!  Truly a great film.
0307454541|4.0|Because one of the two loosely interlinked stories in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is far more compelling than the other, the end of the book proves disappointing, since it was necessary for the more interesting story to be concluded first - a good 100 pages from the end of the book. Thus, keeping reader interest to the last page proves impossible for Steig Larsson, though he did his best by continuing to involve most of the key players in narrating the end to the less interesting second story. That is the main problem in this book: the thin almost non-existent connection between the two primary story lines, and the necessity of ending the book with the less interesting one.<br /><br />What link the two stories together are the main players, Blomkvist and Salander and some of their side-kicks and compatriots. Their actual link-up did not occur, however, for at least the first 300 pages as their separate life stories were developed without overlap. Thus, it was a very long lead-up to their collaboration.  Too long?  Yes. Way too long.<br /><br />Thus, we have the other great flaw in this novel: it is too long (590 pages). While the stories are often very good and engrossing (except for the incomprehensible Swedish geography detail), the book itself is, in my estimation, at least 100+ pages too long. The extra length was sheer fluff, existing on virtually every page and often several pages long - a clear case of \\"too much information\\" (TMI).<br /><br />At times there is a very good, exciting pace to the tale, especially, as an example, when the evil one decides to try to murder Blomkvist with a rifle.<br /><br />Quite a bit of the central story is grisly, almost hard core and brutal pornography - gruesomely difficult to read at times. But after all, the central message of the book revolves around abuse and murder of innocent women. Even the telling about past abuse done to others is awful, let alone the experiencing of it by Salander and -- one time only -- by Blomkvist. Incest, murder and torture become major themes in the book.<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is quite well written and for the most part interesting (except for the secondary story - a world-wide economic gangster scam -- which is, frankly rather dull). The translation, performed by 65 year-old Reg Keeland (who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico), is admirable, though the pages are often peppered with long unused American slang phrases from the 1950s and 1960s, a function of his generation, no doubt and how he perhaps mistakenly believes Swedes talk casually to each other or write. All-in-all, though, it's a zippy translation and quite contemporary. He does an especially good job translating 24 year-old Salander's voice.<br /><br />Salander is by far the most interesting character in the book, completely and fully consistent from one end of the book to the other. She is maddening and funny, sexy and unappealing, smart and dumb all at the same time, but always (almost always anyway) fully on top of everything that occurs in her young life. She is a women's advocate, a champion for abused women everywhere, and with good reason. Her own life is filled with unhappiness, abuse, wrongful societal categorization, and alienation. She blossoms into a more complete woman in the company of Blomkvist, but in the end .... well ... in the end, there is an end, ordinary and sad as it is. The book is really all about Salander, her skill, the ultimate tragedy of her life and her disdain for all authority and societal norms. While she doesn't hate all men (particularly not Blomkvist), she does believe most males are idiots and a good percentage of us abusive and misogynist.<br /><br />Blomkvist is portrayed as the opposite of the male chauvinist pig. He does have his \\"piggish\\" qualities, but they are not founded in a dislike of women. On the contrary, he seems able to charm and seduce almost any woman he finds interesting, regardless of age, social status or background. In a sense, he is really a neutral kind of guy, smart and apparently attractive, and he rarely makes waves.  He's a dogged investigative journalist, who accepts his fate -- time and time again.  The problem with the Salander-Blomkvist relationship is that both are incapable of and uninterested in discussing their relationship. They are together because of mutual sleuthing skills and sex. As such, it can't end well, one might think.<br /><br />Blomkvist's other love interest, Erika Berger, is a flashy successful business woman, Blomkvist's full equal and business partner. She actually is not a very interesting character. The old man, Henrik Vanger, is well portrayed and ably characterized as the elder statesman of his huge and dysfunctional family.<br /><br />I liked the book and I would recommend it to most of my friends and acquaintances. I honestly don't know how to rate it. Is it a 3 or a 5?  I'll settle for a 4.0., smart and apparently attractive, and he rarely makes waves.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Many people have called Green Day \\"sell-outs\\" or \\"modern rock/punk posers\\", but I beg to differ those opinions. True in their early days of \\"Kerplunk!\\" and \\"Dookie\\" they had a punk sound and were full of angst and rebellion, but one can't stay young forever. The prior album to this was \\"Warning\\". That's a great album too, but this one (American Idiot) is the hallmark album of their careers. This album also shows the bands maturity and it shows they have a bit of a soft side. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is about Billy Joe's fathers death and also references to 9/11. For a band to be taken seriously, they need to show some softness and emotion. After 5 years of this albums release, I still get a little emotional when I hear that song. The first single, however, is pretty straight forward. Why conform to the accepted American norm? Don't be American Idiots people! Yes, this is not the first rock opera ever released in the history of music, but it is most certainly one of the best ever. I love every track on this album. I am thirsty for more Billy, Mike and Tre. Please keep on rocking until you are in your 50s!! (Did I mention that I've loved Green Day since \\"Kerplunk\\"?)

0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol came to my mailbox on Tuesday night. By Wednesday night, I had finished the whole book. It took me Tuesday till midnight, then after work Wednesday till around 5:30. And that's the beauty of Dan Brown.    His books are like popular blockbuster movies. They're not artsy, they're not impressive in any way other than, hey, that was entertaining and I do not regret paying for that. This is a perfect book to take on an airplane flight, a vacation, or out to the pool with you. It's fun, it's captivating and like all of his books, it's an easy read.     Whatever your feelings about the Da Vinci Code, you will like this book slightly less than that book. If you thought Da Vinci Code was great, this is good. If you thought it was so-so, this is mediocre.
B0015S3HBA|3.0|Lorin Maazel is a mediocre Sibelius conductor. I don't think Maazel truly understands this music or at least understands it enough to give a convincing interpretation of it. The Vienna Philharmonic play great, but lack direction. The Decca audio quality for this release is only average. Decca have done much better.<br /><br />I think what really makes Sibelius' music great is when it's given room to breathe or when there is an understanding of the spaces inbetween the music. With Maazel, he completely stifles this music and doesn't give the listener proper room to take in what just happened. He's just out of his element here and it shows.<br /><br />That said, there are much better recordings of Sibelius' music than this. Checkout Osmo Vanska, Paavo Berglund, and Leif Segerstam. They know Sibelius and I think they leave all other Sibelius conductors in the dust including Colin Davis, Neeme Jarvi, and John Barbirolli.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|My initial review of this disc was 3 stars, it just didn't hit me in the gut until about a solid month of listening.  Alright - having said that, and after dozens of listens, I've changed my mind. This is a solid Megadeth release with some great guitar and Dave's trademark snarly, growling vocals. Actually, the whole band shines on this release.      Song #2 \\"This Day We Fight\\" is probably the fastest, most angry \\"war cry\\" songs Megadeth has ever done.  \\"For this, I was chosen, 'cause I fear nothing\\"...\\"On this day I decide to anoint my fists - Engaging them in the mode of power and war\\"...This tune will bludgeon you like the butt end of an M-16, putting you right in combat somewhere in Afghanistan or Iraq. This track should be the rallying cry for our military. This tune alone was worth my 15 bucks.    44 Minutes is about the famous North Hollywood shootout in which 2 armored and heavily armed thugs shot up the town, the whole police force, and some SWAT.  Great tune discussing how our cops are outgunned due to politicians squabbling over funding to buy better weapons.     1320 is a fast tune about drag racing. Reminds me of something that could have been on So Far So Good...So What.    Fast forward to Endgame, the album's title song, which is about: a disaster occurs, and FEMA comes in and takes over (kinda like Hurricane Katrina), only the government (Obama) uses it to microchip all the survivors, so the US gov't can control and enslave the population. Dont take the chip, and you are considered an illegal alien...This stuff could really happen!      The next 3 songs seem part of the Endgame theme, which should have been made into a whole theme album in my opinion.     Couple of filler songs at the end, which are OK. Chris does an amazing solo on Nothing left to Lose.
1601251505|1.0|Tried it, didn't like it... and the differences are so minimal from 3.5 it's hardly even worth mentioning -- nothing a few house rules with the original rules couldn't have fixed. Basically, it's 3.5 all over again except it has the DMG and PHB all crammed into one source book with a few minor tweaks here and a there. Whether you love 4.0 or hate it, at least it aspires to be something different.
0385504225|2.0|I was so looking forward to diving into this book. I even pre-ordered it at 40% off - thank goodness. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.I felt like I was reading something I'd aldready read. I'm not even finished yet and can't wait for it to be over. This book is so predictable it's irritating, but I'm going to finish it. The only saving grace is that I now know something about the Freemasons. I should have started reading it from the end. Too much hype, too few surprises.
0307454541|1.0|I found this book to be brutal, disturbing, and overly long.  I will admit that the central mystery was engaging, which is why I got sucked in and finished even though I was very troubled by multiple incidents leading up to the big reveal.  I found the resolution of that mystery to be truly sick--as mortifying as many other horrors committed in this novel.  While I did appreciate the strength of the titular heroine, I can't imagine anyone enjoying this novel unless they find violence against women to be entertaining.<br /><br />In addition to my sheer disgust at the atrocities against women throughout this book (which I still am sickened by days later!), I found the other plot lines to be anticlimactic, even unnecessary.  And I wish that the translator had included some footnotes or a forward giving background for the many allusions to Swedish culture, politics, and finance.
0439023491|5.0|First you should know that I positively detest ANY form of reality TV that does not involve food and cooking or some sort of home improvement (or the girls who live with Heff but I'm not sure that's realy a reality TV show!) I have never watched Survivor or Amazing Race or any other such similar show. So when I was recommended (thanks Ammy!) this on my recommendations list I was like \\"what were they thinking..I'll never like this type of book\\". Like the boy I dumped in 10th grade this book kept showing up everywhere. Finally I decided the universe was trying to tell me something and I should probably listen (I'm usually pretty bright). After I ordered this one I realized I needed to read the first one so I went out and bought it at that famous bookseller place. My daughter was having a sleepover and I started reading at 11PM while waiting for the girls to quiet down. I read straight through until 4AM with only a bathroom break. It was THAT GOOD! I wanted to run out on my balcony and shout that this was the doggone best book ever.<br /><br />So I had extremely high expectations for this book--probably amongst the highest I've ever had for anything outside of Harry Potter. Ms. Collins did not dissapoint. Plenty of other reviews will give you synopsis of the story and all that but I'm here to say that this book drew me even further into this world. I have seldom enjoyed a book that can so thoroughly pull me into the world that I am engrossed enough to ignore anything else just to finish the book. I bit all my nails off and I didn't even realize it! UGH!<br /><br />I would go to a Midnight release for this book. I would actually seek out an author signing if one was done by me. I'd be first in line for tickets if this ever got made into a movie (with a good director). I will pre order the 3rd installment. Even if you think this is not your type of book I highly recommend you read it and The Hunger Games (read that one first!). I have recommended it to literally everyone I know and not one has come back to me except to ask if I got the second book. 'Nuff said.I know and not one has come back to me except to ask if I got the second book. 'Nuff said.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show absolutely rocks. It currently tops my list of TV shows that I enjoy watching and I have a hard time waiting for the next episode. Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors so I fully admit that I'm biased.  He and Stana Katic (Kate Beckett) both give terrific performances in this serious comedy.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie is what EVERY first time home buyer should have.  I have seen it before but I came to Amazon when I wanted a copy I didn't want to pay too much for.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I have moved this movie to the top of my all-time favorites list.  Kate Winslett was superb, but so were all the principal characters.  The chemistry between Eli Wallach and Kate was fantastic.  Any time I'm feeling down this movie makes me happy and when I'm not down I still love it!  Yes, it's a chick flick, but in my opinion Nancy Meyers is a great writer/director, who allowed Jack Black to improvise with excellent results.  My significant other has watched it with me at least 5 times, so it's a chick flick that guys enjoy too!
B000067J1I|5.0|A great movie, I saw this in the theater and I wanted to give it to a friend as a gift.  I had a little trouble finding it but found it here for the best price.

Wow, was I pleasantly surprised to find this book very interesting from a business management and historical perspective. The exhaustive research reference in the text give great case studies and many relevant conclusions.<br /><br />Highly recommend for everyone in business, no matter your position in the corporate ladder.

B002L3RVCY|5.0|I can't wait for this Season to be released and although it's not out yet I am rating the episodes themselves and they were great.  This is what Star Wars is all about action adventure humor and just having a good time.  This show was far better than I imagined I was very skeptical but it surpassed my expectations.  George Lucas said he is going to make 100 episodes of this show so about 5 Seasons so if you are a Star Wars fan it's a good time right about now.  Season 2 is coming up in a few weeks and there is a live action show coming in a year or so.

0307454541|5.0|\\"One more man who hates women,\\" Lisbeth Salandar quotes near the end of the book. It's a fitting line, given the multiple plots that cross the novel. In fact, the original Swedish title of the novel is \\"M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor\\", which translates to \\"Men Who Hate Women\\". Without giving much of the story away, I can safely say that this  novel is, absolutely, about men who hate women. And yet at the same time, it's not about these things at all.<br /><br />The novel is, at its core, the story of a journalist (Mikael Blomkvist) and a young hacker (Lisbeth Salander), who come to work together to uncover the 40-year old mystery of a missing girl in Sweden, Harriet Vanger. Other plots weave their way in and out-- Blomkvist's humiliation as a story he writes is proven to be false and he is sentenced to prison for libel; Salander's person turmoil; the skeletons buried deep in the cupboards of the Vanger family-- and all culminate in an ending that I honestly did not see coming.<br /><br />Larrson, may he rest in peace, has skill. He took a plot that is, simply, about men hating women in horrible, awful, abusive way, and turned it into a novel that is at once horrifying and shocking and elegant and beautiful. The mystery of Harriet becomes an obsession for her uncle, Henrik, who hires Blomkvist to investigate her disappearance forty years after the fact. There are dozens of characters, locations, and subplots, and Larrson weaved them together with expertise and skill.<br /><br />The book took me a long time to read (about four days), but that's because it's a lot more dense than any of the books I've read lately. Pick the book up in the store one day, see how small the text is on the page! Whew! But wow, A+ all the way. If you have the patience to work through it (it's not boring, just difficult to absorb because it's so complex), then you should absolutely give it a try. You'll find yourself addicted.

B000VDDWDS|5.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version.<br /><br />The DVD version was quite good, but the BD version is a definitive home version.<br /><br />Audio take full advantage of uncompressed codec very much like HBO's bluray version of Band of Brothers, there is full range of imaging that takes the viewers into the movie, rather than a distant observer: gun salvos fly from left to right, FRONT to BACK, tools and objects ring with clang of old metal alloys or wood.  One minor quip is the dialog channel is weak and needs equalization, as its often drowned out by sound effects.<br /><br />The BD transfer has the flatness of movie film but details are far sharper and clearer, so many of the background elements have more detail given the higher quality of BD.  However, the BD version is far less a revolution in clarity, the DVD is still quite good.<br /><br />While I know nothing of the book vs movie version, the Napoleon era nautical style and medicine I know something of.  History buffs will revel at the detailed accuracy of much of the movie, making it worth watching multiple times: small details as the knots used, the way sails are deployed, faint mumblings in the background of nautical commands as the ship in put in order, the surgical equipment and style, the dialog old English, are all period accurate with ne'er a fault, IMHO.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are a shame, as its inclusion as a director's cut would have added more to the characters than the theatrical release, and are well worth viewing.  Alas, its DVD quality but marvelously done.

B002GZQY6Q|3.0|Porcupine Tree has always had terrific ideas and this album isn't any different in that respect.  But generally it's what they do with all the ideas that creates so much of the real magic, and it's what turns 3-star albums into 5-star albums.  'The Incident' has about twice as many musical ideas as it should, and sadly, many of those are very much under-developed -- it's just too many things stuffed into way too small of a space.    'Occams's Razor,' which kicks off the album is a case in point.  It starts out with the repetion of a few really heavy-sounding D chords, and on the second repeat includes a little E to G# melody over the top of the chords.  So far, so good.  But then that's as far as that idea ever goes.  The rest of the song has some seemingly unrelated quiet noodling on accoustic guitar followed by a reprise of the D chords, but it all seems fairly pointless.  We don't ever hear this idea again throughout the whole album (this is not entirely true -- it is repeated later in 'Degree Zero', but almost as a verbatim repetion, rather than a differently restated or developed idea).  And, in general, this doesn't have to be a bad thing -- a couple of stand-alone chords never really hurt anybody, but in this case it's quite symptomatic of the stand-alone nature of many of the other ideas on the album.    The third track, 'Great Expectations,' starts out very promising with a simple accoustic guitar and vocal part, which comes around for a second verse with some ambient guitar and synthesizer sounds added behind it.  It's at this point where the song seems to be going somewhere, but then just as quickly it's over and we're into 'Kneel and Disconnect,' which is musically unrelated to 'Expectations.'  Why quit one idea and move onto another when you weren't done with the first one?    There are plenty of other examples of this on the album, including, for me, the most eggregious example, which is the strummed accousitic guitar part at the end of 'The Seance.'Every time I hear it I think What was that all about?  This riff comes out of nowhere, is repeated four times, and ends just as abruptly as the song segues into 'Circle of Manias.'  The only relation to anything seems to be that the riff is in 9/8 time and so is 'Circle.'  But that's not enough to make a real connection between the two songs -- it just ends up sounding like fragments of music stuck together.  Just about every song on the album that comes in at two and half minutes or less seems underdeveloped.  And even some of the longer tracks suffer somewhat from the same problem.  The five-minute title track is split up into two very clear A and B sections, neither of which seems to have anything to do with the other, other than the fact that they're both tracked into the same song on the disk.    It's not to say that all the songs are underdeveloped.  'Time Flies' has about four pretty simple ideas and yet manages to be a really satisfying 11-minute song.  The thing that really sells 'Time Flies' for me is the amount of space and breathing room that it's got.  All the ideas have a chance to settle and be heard, so it gives you something to grab on to.  It's got a simple accoustic part with a repeating rhythmic figure; repeating chords that you hear on each successive verse and chorus; some denser sections; an extended middle section of completely different music that takes it's time building up to nice noisy, tortured guitar solo -- it's all great.  The much shorter 'Circle of Manias' starts out with an incredibly excellent and evil-sounding opening riff, and then the rest of the song is pretty much just expansion on this one riff and they squeezed out as much as they could get out of it.  This song is great for many reasons, not the least of which is because there are some dynamics in there.  At one point, the guitar keeps repeating the opening riff, but quiets down with the drums a bit to give some space for the keyboards to take a prominent role for a bit and have a bit of interplay between instruments.  No fragments at all in that song -- every part has a purpose.    And so it ends up being an album of half really good stuff and half not too bad but really not great stuff.  So, for a Porcuipne Tree album, 'The Incident' is just OK.  But when I go back and listen to previous albums, there was obviously more time, craft and patience put into them.  And speaking of that, special mention must be made Gavin's drumming which is usually such a highlight, but along with many other things on this album was also a bit of letdown.  There isn't nearly as much of the hard discipline and preparation that I've heard so clearly in his playing on previous albums.  This time it just sounded like he was on auto-pilot for most of it.  It's all kind of a loose hodge-podge of Gavin-sounding ideas from his bag of tricks without any clear focus.  Much of it sounds like he didn't really meant it -- it feels like he's just playing along with a song in 4 or one in 3, and if he were to play through the song again, the fills and patterns might be a bit different.  So, it ends up just being kind of Gavin background drumming and not a real difinitive statement.  Notable exceptions are, again, 'Circle of Manias' and sections of 'Time Flies' where he seemed to have an idea of the kind of drum part he wanted to play over each section, each with some kind of recurring idea in it that he stuck to.
0385504225|3.0|Plenty of reviews already so I'll keep mine short. If this book's author wasn't \\"Dan Brown\\" and it had nothing to do with \\"The DaVinci Code\\" or \\"Angels & Demons,\\" this book probably wouldn't be a bestseller. Dan Brown's bag of tricks got worn out quickly. Anyone who read DaVinci could tell this story was using the same mechanics. The plot didn't have that many twists, and there was no last-second double-crossing or revelation of a snitch. The climax was entirely anticipated if you ever read a mystery/suspense novel. If you loved 'Angels' and 'DaVinci,' curiosity alone will compel you to read this. If you never read any of Dan Brown's stuff, this book won't be a good first impression.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|Sorry....another negative review here.   I won't get too in depth with it, because most everything to say has already been said by the others.    Unfortunately, I could care less for this album.  I know sometimes it takes a great album a certain length of time to expose its most intimate self to the listener, and knowing that, I have literally forced myself to listen to this album, just hoping that exposure would happen.  It hasn't.  The album is lacking so much that has made previous PT works so great.  The typical expansive sound structures, deeply layered musical textures, fresh melodies, and quality lyrics that are the norm for this fantastic band just struggle to make an appearance on this work.   After being an ardent follower and fan of these guys since The Sky Moves Sideways came out (nearly 15 years now) I would have to say that this is their first disappointing release.  After such a great collection of albums to date, this one just seems bland.   I figure that maybe PT have spoiled me and a somewhat decent CD seems mediocre as a result.    Maybe that's the case.   Or maybe, as another review mentioned SW is just spreading his creativity too thin with all these less than impacting side-projects.
B002EE583O|5.0|The Stone Roses' first album is an undisputed landmark of the pre-BritPop / `Madchester' era - one that would prove enormously influential on the early to mid-90's Britpop bands like Oasis, Blur, etc.  This new remastered edition (2cd's/1DVD) is a very good value for the money (I paid around $20-22), as you get:    The debut album itself, which sounds FAR better than the original CD.  The original cd sounded a bit `thin', and this reissue sounds clearer, with more bass, and an overall higher sound level - I A/B'd it on my home system, and the reissue thundered.  The only drawback to the album itself in this package is the omission of `Elephant Stone', which, I found out, was not on the original UK release, but was on the US cd that I have, as a bonus cut.  `Elephant Stone', which is a very good cut, IS on disc 2 of this collection, albeit in demo form, so if you have the original CD (or the Complete Stone Roses cd), don't get rid of them just yet as they have the 'real' versions of the song, which you'll want to have.    The 2nd disc is of demos - quality (sonics and artistic) vary a bit, and there's some good material here of both album and non-album songs, so for the hard-core Stone Roses fan, it's an interesting, insightful document.      Disc 3 is a DVD containing the August 1989 Blackpool show that is generally acknowledged as a crucial show in their history.  I don't think every song from the show is actually on this (judging by the running time of around 55 minutes and the setlist you can see in shots of Reni's drumkit), but it's very good, and the end raveup (last 10 min of the show) is probably what cemented their reputation.  Film quality is decent - some grain, but more than ok for viewing on a big screen (as I did).  This DVD sealed my satisfaction with the package, as I believe it was only previously available in the US on hard-to-find VHS and import DVD's (I have it on my PAL version of the Complete Stone Roses).  There are also six videos from the era on this DVD, which were also on The Complete Stone Roses.  So versus the Complete Stone Roses import DVD I have, we're basically missing the TV appearances on disc 2 of that set, but for what you get here, it's probably more important to have the Blackpool show.    Excellent packaging, nice notes from the principals, with the notable omission of having no comments from John Squire, who doesn't appear to have participated much in this project (Producer John Leckie and Ian Brown supervised the remastering) - apparently, Squire and Brown still aren't seeing eye to eye (putting it mildly), after all these years.  Too bad - it'd have been nice to have some insights/narrative from Squire, who is arguably the best guitarist of that generation.  All in all, though, a nice packaging/remaster of one of the key rock albums of the last 20 years - if you've never owned it, this is a terrific edition to get just for the album itself and the DVD, and if you only have the original edition, this one is a near-revelation.

0385006896|5.0|When I was 10 years old, my Aunt Shirley gave me a copy of \\"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\\".....yes, at 10 years of age...I was enthralled with every single page. Some of the words I didn't know very well, and I sure didn't understand about drug addiction...heck, that was in the 1960's - but I became such a fan of the great Holmes as a result of this book. Lengthy? You betcha! Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's depiction of the life & times, and obsessions of Holmes, still captivates me today, and yes, I still have the same book, much-loved and with a well-worn spine.
817224164X|1.0|I'm reviewing this particular edition of Mein Kampf, not the book itself or Hitler's arguments. If you just want to understand what Hitler's philosophy was, this is fine and inexpensive.    HOWEVER, I bought this for research purposes, and have found that the translation is sloppy. Moreover, it is full of typos and I find it difficult to believe it was even proof-read before going to print. For example it has Hitler referring to a battle in \\"1948\\", when it is obviously 1848. Another example: \\"It would be a stake to think that the followers of various political parties...\\". Surely that should be \\"mistake\\", not \\"stake\\". Unfortunately this edition is riddled with errors such as this, which is only a reflection of lazy translation and proofing. As a result, I can't be 100% sure that it is accurate, so will have to cross-reference with another edition.
0307277453|5.0|A very clean and understandable adventure and an explanation of not only paleontology, but also evolutionary genetics and contemporary breakthroughs in science. The book is readable though a little dry at times, and presents a broad view of the origins of species from an evolutionary standpoint. Neil Shubin gives his case in terms easily understandable by laymen, and carefully explains all the science. All the scientific theories given in the book are well explained and then proof is provided, as well as predictions successfully made and the results of experiments given.    This is how science workds. It just makes sense.    Very good!

I'm sure he will be ecstatic when he recieves it.    Great book, great price. I recommend this book for any young adult animator who is interested in this.
1439157383|1.0|Okay, so the writing was okay, and the narration of the audiobook on Audible was absolutely excellent.    The premise of the book is so kooky and contrived that it failed to elicit any sympathy from me, largely because it seems perfectly obvious that the idea of conceiving a child specifically and only so that you can use them as a tissue bank to prolong (not save, but prolong) your other child's life is just wrong.    This story absolutely would have worked for me if Anna had already been born when Kate was diagnosed, but as it's written, I didn't find the book thought-provoking in any way at all.    And the ending? Least satisfying ending since the movie version of Stephen King's \\"It\\".    At the end of the book, I had to fight the urge to jump on an airplane so that I could find Jodi Picoult's house and throw rocks at it while screaming obscenities from the curb. \\"Here, spend 13 and a half hours with my book, and in the last ten minutes, I'm going to make your entire 13 hours into a total waste of time.\\"    Jodi Picoult, I want my thirteen hours and twenty minutes back! And my Audible credit, too!    Disclaimer: I'm not much of an actual stalker/rock thrower.  I'm an accountant; we're indoor cats.

B001L1S1SK|5.0|I have to say much of the average Tv fair just doesn't hold my interest. So when \\"Ugly Betty\\" came along and Freinds said \\" I had to watch it\\" I took it was a grain of salt. I think the main reason I did turn in was I had been a Fan of the Music of Vanessa Williams. SO 4 years ago I put the show on and 1/2 durning the show I moved to right in front of the tv (No Answering Email durning UB) and there I have stayed for all three seasons.  I read that for many \\"Betty\\" lost it's edge for many last year and I don't understand that. I did feel if anything Season 2 (with the writing strike) was the weaker of the 3 seasons and Season three was right back on track-but I guess that's par for the course while I go \\"HUH?\\" to \\"The Office\\" that others love, I am still all about \\"betty\\" and so many have moved on. I do hope we get at least 5 seasons as I still find this the best hour on tv.

1416583408|1.0|I was looking  forward to this book based on the Times book section review, but found it amazingly misinformed and frustratingly biased against nature.  She said it was odd that dogs came from wolves, which are carnivores and dogs were of little value too humans other that companionship.  It must be hard for some people to conceive of their love bugs as helping hunter/gatherers (early humans) hunt, and protect their human family, but it's been a tough world out there for thousands of years, kill or be killed.  Cats are carnivores too.   Alexandra Horowitz seems to have quite a few factoids at her disposal, though in every area where I have some experience her factoids are wrong and lead her to bizarre conclusions.  Having a Ph.D. in cognitive science, you'd think she knew that people and animals can move their eyes to follow a moving object; they don't have to move their heads, with the possible exception of certain religious sects.  Also, she doesn't know that films display 24 frames per second, regardly of how they were recorded.  Television scans horizontal lines which refresh the screen every 30 seconds.  Most films are not shown in digital form.  I'm shocked that she doesn't get this.  Also, the fact that dogs typically have a faster flicker/refresh rate explains why they can more accurately track the flight of a frisbee in the air, and can't make sense out of relatively slow flicker rates used in film and television - this leads her to the silly conclusion that this is because they see the object SOONER, rather than simply more often. Also, perhaps some scientists' dogs don't know the difference between a street and a curb as she states, but mine certainly have and I'm no expert trainer. I also don't know who told her that domestic dogs can't hunt and feed themselves.  I had an almost crippled dog that could grab a meal any time she was in nature, in the same way many wolves do, by flipping field mouses in the air.  She didn't eat them, but if hungry she could have.  Ms. Horowitz's loathing of hunting, or helping humans hunt, prevents her from understanding the most elemental things about canines.  I haven't hunted in over 50 years and never will again, but you are too citified to understand that you can't understand dogs.  She becomes snide and uninformed on the few occasions she mentions the subject.         I don't believe it's enlightened to tell people their dogs eat almost all human food.  She suggests carrots, celery and brocholi stems.  Do I detect a VEGAN/PETA girl philosophy?  More ominously, she tells readers that people should never correct their pooches.  If your dog relieves herself in your apartment, don't 'correct' or scold her, you might hurt her feelings.  Just 'lead by example' and reward them when they do something right.  Have her dogs used the toilet?  Visitors to her apartment are at the mercy of her incontrolled dogs, who slobber on them at will.  While she admitts in a single sentance that working dogs are much more animated than city dogs, she never has taken the time to understand how they work, see, and generally perceive their surroundings and communicate.   Factoids about olfactory biology does not cut it.  I could go on and on about the voluminous mistakes or mistatements of facts, but that would be a book in itself.   James Tugend
0156030209|5.0|I thought it was a very interesting read, well written, and a very enjoyable read.

0385341008|5.0|Guernsey, an island in the English Channel off the coast of France, was occupied by the Germans during WW II. The islanders created this \\"society\\" out of necessity and as a result of a lie. Some of the Society members had never read a book and here they are now reading the classics. Reading became an escape for them to bring them together and to get their minds away from the German Occupation. It also served as a way to socialize without thinking about the Occupation.<br />The narrative is all letters which is a very interesting way to write a story. Julia, the author, is taken in by these wonderful, honest and kind people. They open their hearts and voices to her. The story is of suffering and survival. It is a heart warming and very touching love story. It is about a community who comes together in extremely difficult times. Will we hear more from Annie Barrows? It is sad that Mary Ann Shaffer passed away as the book was being published.<br />I did not go into detail (other reviewers have done that) about the characters (all of whom I love) or the flow of the story through the letter corresponcdence. Readers will not be disappointed. To read this book is to enjoy a real treat and find new friendships.<br />Now, I would like to visit Guernsey.<br />I purchased this book at Amazon.com

I saw everything this guy did right on camera before this guy got on the plane. When did he have time to get a parachute?\\"<br /><br />This entire novel is filled with this. The author doesn't want the reader to know or guess anything, so he backtracks continuously to fill in his plot holes.<br /><br />There were some interesting facts embedded in the storyline. I enjoyed the portions where Langdon is having flashbacks and repeats classroom lectures.<br /><br />There was a major plot hole involving the `bad guy.' I cannot go into much detail due to spoilers. Suffice it to say, there is a portion of the book told from his point of view early on that negates some revealed facts later.<br /><br />The ending was excessively slow as the book goes on for several chapters after the action and danger are over. I also found the resolution to be simplistic and contrived.<br /><br />Character Development: 3 Stars<br /><br />I do not expect a whole lot of character development in a novel of this type. I expect just enough to justify actions.<br /><br />He does fail in a spectacular way with the character of Peter. Throughout the novel, we are not given near enough insight to judge Peter. At the end, some characterization is tacked on, but it is a bit too little, too late.<br /><br />Writing Style: 2 1/2 Stars<br /><br />I have heard many people denigrate Mr. Brown's writing, but I have to disagree on all counts, save one, which I will explain below. Sure, his writing is rather simple with no flowers. However, this is an action novel. For the type of book, his writing style is exactly what is called for.<br /><br />The only problem I have with Mr. Brown's writing style is still a large one. His suspense technique is forced and unnecessary.<br /><br />Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 Stars<br /><br />Having spaces between the paragraphs was annoying because I read with my font set to \\"3.\\" The extra spacing just causes more page turns.<br /><br />Rating: PG-15 for Adult Situations, Sexual References & Violence.<br /><br />Writing Style: 2 1/2 Stars<br /><br />I have heard many people denigrate Mr. Brown's writing, but I have to disagree on all counts, save one, which I will explain below.

0385504225|2.0|Having read every book written by Dan Brown I was really looking forward to enjoying another exciting adventure with his characters.  I'm sorry to have to say that this book did not deliver for me.  Other reviews in this venue touch on the same issues I would raise with respect to the cliche characters, etc.  But for me, of greater import was my not being able to buy into the premise that was the basis for the whole \\"national security crisis\\" string.  While it was somewhat interesting to read about the Masonic rituals portrayed as being part of a secret video that would cause chaos througout the world, I don't think most people would get all that upset.  We have much more to be upset about these days perhaps.  I'm disappointed with this one - sorry!
0385504225|5.0|I don't know what book some of these other reviewers are reading, but the book I got was fantastic. I read the first 1/2 prior to going to Washington DC with my sister. We visited all the mentioned places, followed the clues, analysed the art, and just couldn't read the book fast enought.<br /><br />It was fantastic. I found the ending very thoughful, and I'm still thinking about it. Read the book! If you're not in DC, at least pull the images up online to make the book even more alive for you.<br /><br />Loved it.
1554072840|4.0|The book is great my grandaughter loves to tell the book back to us.  So far she's not great with the potty, but she knows the information.  Unfortunately we had a shipping problem, but Amazon was prompt to give credit.
0446560065|5.0|I have been enchanted by Simon's Cat on YouTube for 2 years now.  I wasn't sure how this would come across in book format but it is brilliant!  It maintains the same tone with its wordless cartoons - and every picture defintely tells a story.  I am owned by several cats and Simon definitely understands feline behavior and portrays it indescribably well.    I have several cat lovers on my Christmas list who will be getting copies of this wonderful book.  I look forward to more from this creative genius!
B002B396TK|4.0|I remember seeing Moby back in the early 90s at a club in Chicago.  This was during his \\"rave\\" days and the entire show was pretty much a bunch of repetitive beats and loops.  Great for dancing, but not much more than that.    If you would have asked me then about what would happen to him, I would have thought he would just disappear, along with the other \\"rave\\" artists who have done just that.  Instead, he evolved and started working on songs with a more solid structure, which could be appreciated outside of the club.      This album is full of great songs, some which (GASP!!) actually got played on the radio and MTV.  If you're a fan of Moby's earlier stuff, there is enough here that you'll appreciate it, but I think this will open him up to a bunch of new fans who might not be aware he has been around for about 20 years.    A great album and a real bargain!  If you like artists like the Chemical Brothers or Basement Jaxx, you will enjoy this one.
0385504225|1.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books, this book does not meet the engaging standard I would have hoped.  Boring.
0385504225|1.0|I always thought I liked Dan Brown's writing. All of his novels have been thought-provoking, and the early thrillers (Digital Fortress, Deception Point) were very good lead-ins to the gripping Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code. So I started The Lost Symbol with great expectations, only to become bogged down in endless pomposity (\\"The Rose Cross,\\" Langdon explained, \\"is a common symbol in Freemasonry. In fact, one of the degrees of the Scottish Rite is called 'Knights of the Rose Cross' and honors the early Rosicrucians, who contributed to Masonic mystical philosophy. Peter may have mentioned the Rosicrucians to you\\"), driven forward by melodramatic pronouncements (\\"You will help me stop this man,\\" Sato said. \\"He has the potential to bring about a cataclysm from which this country might not recover\\"). The good guys are all wooden and the bad guys are caricatures, including an apparently psychotic CIA security director and a narcissistic, merciless killer (in this case a tattooed mystic rather than an albino monk). I struggled through to page 330, then gave up. My advice is to wait for the movie.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Awesome follow up to the first season. So far, this is my favorite season, but you have to start with season 1. The overriding story line is excellent, exciting and suspenseful. I'm waiting for Micheal C. Hall to win an Emmy (he's been nominated for best actor twice for this series).
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Much has been made lately of the Beatles' mono recordings, and yet this set proves to be worth the hype.  A feast for both the eyes and ears, \\"The Beatles in Mono\\" presents listeners with miniature versions of the original Beatles LP containers (reproduced in precise detail right down to the inner sleeves), beautifully remastered sound that is not over-equalized or compressed, and a handsome outer white container that is durable and understated, perfect for display.<br /><br />Overall the Beatles' mono sound is punchier, more immediate, and much cleaner than the stereo versions. Plus you don't get the extreme channel separation as on the stereo versions of the early albums (which to be fair was quite common in 1960s stereo recordings). The Beatles reportedly were more involved with the mono mixes (at least through Magical Mystery Tour), and most purists will tell you the mono versions are the definitive Beatles recordings. (Although I personally have doubts as to how \\"involved\\" they really were on the mixing of their earlier albums, since their tour schedule only allowed brief respites for recording purposes).<br /><br />From a sound quality standpoint, there is much greater dynamic range on the earlier albums than on their previous CD incarnations (\\"Beatles for Sale\\" is particularly improved), while the mono versions of Sgt. Pepper and the White Album simply must be heard to be believed.<br /><br />There is some truth to the statement that The White Album has no definitive version (the stereo and mono mixes were largely created at the same time, and the Beatles were more involved in the stereo mixes than on previous albums, and were now using 8-track equipment). Still, the mono White Album is a beast to reckon with. Ideally, one should probably own both versions.<br /><br />Conversely, the mono version of Sgt. Pepper is superior in every way to the stereo. Tracks like \\"LSD\\", with its psychedelic phasing effects, and \\"She's Leaving Home\\", heard here at a faster speed which makes it much less morose, blow away their stereo counterparts. John Lennon, George Harrison and George Martin are all on record saying that the mono version of Pepper is superior, and one listen will confirm this. It is indeed the \\"jewel in the crown\\" of the mono set, indeed of the Beatles' entire recorded output.<br /><br />This set is overpriced to be sure, and no one seems able to predict how \\"limited\\" its production run will be, but for Beatles fans this is a collector's dream. And if the CD format is indeed on its way out, at least it's making a first-class exit.s morose, blow away their stereo counterparts.

B0025KVLUQ|4.0|I love this album but that horrible song Maxwell's Silver Hammer just ruins the entire album. Paul McCartney must have had a really bad case of hemorrhoids when he wrote this song because it is just terrible. It is like listening to someone scratching on a chalkboard. They should just redo this album and take that song off and insert I Am Amazed.
0385737424|5.0|Fabulous and compelling narrator. Page turner and thought provoking at the same time. Great story.    Be aware that the narrator's mother is not married and never has been. Sometimes the mother's boyfriend stays overnight.    Foul Language - None, that I remember.  Sex - None.  Violence - An accident that is dealt with appropriately. (Trying not to spoil anything. Let me know if you want more detail.)
B001GCUO16|4.0|A very nice move but the problem is that you cant her the audio on a ps3 Even with the last update (3.0.1 ) if the settings on bit stream ; it should be on ( pcm ) such a waste not to hear the ( dts HD )  And for the move in some clips when a blue screen background it seems very obvious that the lighting and colors deifiers ( it could have been done better)    But for the move it is one of the best
0385504225|2.0|Laughable is the best word to describe Brown's long awaited, but deeply disappointing novel. While I enjoyed learning about all the secrets and little known facts about Washington D.C., it seems he just threw them all into a fish bowl, pulled them out one by one and then tried to link them into the same old story line that he used in his other Robert Langdon books. Predictable, poor character development (or perhaps more like no character development), and downright boring in places! And for a guy with eidetic memory, Langdon sure forgot a lot of important things. I can't see even Tom Hanks making this role work in the movie version. And what I thought was the most fascinating concept, the noetic science, was nothing more than a before-thought and and after-thought. Dan Brown is laughing all the way to the bank with this one. He has joined that ever-growing club of authors (Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson, etc.) who start out with promise, but then get lazy and rely on previous fame and a tired-out formula for the sole purpose of making more money.
B00284BNKC|4.0|You'd think they would have researched opiates and such but, when you use opiates, your pupils get smaller not larger.  Everytime they shoot up their pupils expand where, in real life they get smaller.  A obvious error that could have been done right if any research had been done.
0385504225|2.0|While I devotedly read on hour after hour, I did not feel the tension that kept me up much of the night I read Da Vinci Code.  Likewise, there was not an interesting character relationship like in Angels and Demons.  In the end, Lost Symbol was a fun, but bland read that will be forgotten quickly in years to come.
