B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I think each person will take away something different from this story.<br /><br />For me it was that we have forgotten so much of what we should know. All the mystery we may have had inside our memories fades away in the day to day monotony of &#34;real life&#34;.<br /><br />It also struck me that perhaps this story was about the difference between our own reality and the reality of others.<br /><br />I found is story enchanting and insightful. After all, it had to be about me, since I am the heroine in MY reality.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! Kids love it and so do older kids..... The MINIONS are hilarious and the levels are fun. It's a great game!!!
B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|Recently the once-imaginative Disney studios have been churning out big-budget eye candy, devoid of any original plotting, interesting characters, or compelling dialogue.  \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", \\"John Carter\\", \\"The Lone Ranger\\", the list goes on and on.  Millions are spent on bright colors, hyperkinetic camera moves, and gaudy CGI, with apparently no thought given to narrative drive or character development (do the writers and directors of this garbage not \\"get it\\" or do they simply not care?).  This \\"Oz...\\" story is just another in the seemingly endless series of garish, empty movies with no heart and no \\"head\\" (intelligent, thoughtful construction).<br /><br />With such a disastrous script and so unimaginative an approach, it's no wonder that the acting is wooden at best (Weisz, Franco) and dreadful at worst (Mila Kunis, whose acting skills seem to have deteriorated from \\"That 70s Show\\").<br /><br />I'm a fan of most things Oz - from the Baum books, to the Thompson (and others) sequels, and the legendary 1939 film; even Gregory McGuire's books (\\"Wicked\\", et al) showed some imaginative flair and nicely-crafted writing.  All had their distinctive appeal.  This monstrosity adds nothing to the long line of imaginative \\"Oziana\\", and it's only value is to re-enforce how completely bereft of creativity the Disney studios have become.  Avoid at all costs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I look forward to playing this game on a daily basis!!! This game is awesome!!!! Definitely a TOTAL MUST-HAVE!!! My whole family loves to play it!
B00DMEQP46|3.0|As any MGMT fan knows, this duo has always been out there but they've almost never forgot to bring their bag of tunes to their albums.  On their self-titled third album, it appears either that bag was left at home or was brought in with not much more than cobwebs and stale air.  \\"Alien Days\\" starts off on a very promising note, sounding like a long-lost Bowie space oddity tune and it does sneak into your brain after a couple of listens.  This opening track picks up where \\"Congratulations\\" left off, but when the second track sets in, you just kinda go \\"huh\\" and it slowly sinks into aural quicksand after that.  \\"Your Life is a Lie\\" and \\"Plenty of Girls in the Sea\\" grab you for a bit, but they turn out to be mostly false hopes.  This album isn't awful as a whole, but the atmospheric drifting in a mostly tuneless sea gets to be a drag.  The closer \\"Orphan of Fortune\\" really slogs and it's a relief when it's over.  So one is left with one great tune, a couple of wannabes and some track numbers that probably won't register.  Stick with the first two albums and hope for a better fourth one.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Not my type of reading. But I had to see what all the fuss was about, as they say, curiosity killed the cat
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|liked it , liked it, it was a fun movie of mystery to figure how did they do that.  I think people would enjoy it that like magic and entertainment.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Let's me keep track of my selling and shipping when I am not close to home.  Very helpful when in a bidding situation instead of risking false run up on last minute bidding.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Awesome book. I wanted the story to keep going. Should definitely be made into a movie. I will read it again for sure.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game. Good graphics on the kindle fire HD. Had a moment of lag but it fixed  immediately and wasn't during kill time. Takes a little bit of time to get 100% used to it but still entertaining.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. Its so addicting and fun. I play it everyday and its awesome that you now can play it on facebook too.

B009IEXKXI|3.0|a  book is read for pleasure or some other reason but  not to make a required report as this takes away the joy
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|this game is interesting and fun. I like the three levels of difficulty. as always the graphics are great<br />the hint should not give so many levels of help though.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Works perfect with USB 2 or 3 source, tested with a Canon 1D4 and Nikon D800. Great for tethered shooting.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was frustrated with the calculator app that came standard on my tablet especially because it didn't have a percent key. I use my tablet calculator frequently for calculating discounts when I'm shopping. This app has a percent key as well as keeping the history - a feature I never thought about, but comes in handy instead of repeating a calculation a second time.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book is an undertaking, but I loved it. It's creative and pushed the boundaries of how I thought about belief and storytelling. Loved it.
B003K16P50|4.0|This is worthwhile even if you've seen the movie.  Inventive and caring story with excellently crafted writing.  The plot and detail of such incongruous worlds intersecting were well worth it
B003BZXHX8|5.0|I like her performance and she makes you feel as if you are sitting in the audience.  You really get to know her.  The band; drummer, bass & guitar, could not have been better and the piano player, Tamir Hendelman, was exquisite.  If you like night club piano jazz love songs, this is it!  Peter in River Club, FL
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it .It does not get black or get mess up its nice and the update is cool they should add more stuff soon
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This story tugs at your heart.....it is a story of a lost child; of a search for trust; and of the power that love can have on even the most broken. Not what I expected from the title but...it was a page turner.  This book helps us to understand just how complicated a relationship can be and how the act of forgiving can heal even the most damaged/needy individual.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Great movie, always a trekkie fan and also good quality for not being your BLURAY HD versions of the movie
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator serves all my needs very well.  The buttons are large and it is easy to read all the numbers.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I enjoy sometimes not having to open my laptop to read messages or replying on my smartphone with limited space. This is very convenient.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Fell in love with The National with this recording. Each song on the album is my favorite. How often does that happen? (never)
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|If you like playing this on your smartphone you'll love it even more on a tablet. I enjoy the graphics and sounds.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game for all. Just change the number of squares.  Very challenging and hard to put it down.  Keeps your brain engaged.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|This title just snuck up out of nowhere on me.. I saw the trailer a few weeks back and decided to buy & honestly, I was just expecting this to be just another Nick Cage movie... alright, it is, BUT this one has a lot going for it. I loved the cult aspect and the action sequences. The dialogue isn't half bad either... reminded me of a grindhouse flick, but updated..kind of like Tarantino's Grindhouse, \\"Death Proof\\"..with a touch of \\"Ghost Rider\\" thrown in. I also loved William Fichtner's character and he played it extremely well..almost too well, he added the comic relief in this movie. The only down side was Nick's Hair... he really needs to see someone about that, or at least switch it up..All in all, it's not an academy award winner, but it is what it is, a slam bam action movie that is built for amusement..and boy, was I ever..even in 2D.. Sit back, shut up  and go for the ride.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|I like games that don't cause tension, because I play them to relax.  Got enough pressure in my life I don't need to fabricate more.  I get plenty of time to solve the puzzle and am starting to look ahead and plan my attack--something I like games to allow me to do.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a fantastic application to have! It gives you hours of fun. There are different sizes that you can make the puzzle pieces, which can change how hard a puzzle is. Love It!!
0545265355|5.0|I read these books before the movies came out.  I like the boxed set because you have all of the books and can keep them together.
B00EJYGQFG|4.0|I feel like the catchy beat makes the song. The vocals are great, as always, although she could have done a bit more with it. Although at the same time, how much more COULD she have done?<br />This song is simply for fun; it's not meant to be deep or meaningful (well kind of, but more of a semi-deep exploration into Gaga's mind), and those who criticize it for not being so should look at most pop music, and then look at the Born This Way era for Lady Gaga, which was full of meaning and depth.<br />Overall, I give it 4 (or 4.5, maybe, if it was available) out of 5.
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|This is a must own soundtrack, Ramin does a great job on this. It really pumps you up. I feel like watching the movie everytime I listen to it.

1476734941|5.0|We saw the TV documentary about this diet and were impressed by the results this man got following this diet. The book is clear and concise and contains recipes in the back of the book. If you are disciplined enough to be able to fast for two days a week, it will work wonders for you.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It's too bad we're only allowed 5 stars. If I could, I'd give it a ten! It really keeps you guessing throughout the whole season, as it did during Season 1. I highly recommend this to anyone other than small children.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Loved the first two movies and I Enjoyed this one too! I'd recommend this one to anyone who liked the first two!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|A very good book.  Hard to put down!  I will definitely continue the series. It is hard to find good series like this one.
B005HSL626|5.0|I am enjoying to play on this game for a good time. But I didn't use on it because I am doing busy on my life.

B00BGI076M|5.0|Amazing show, it keeps you guessing at every turn. Best show on tv, by far Fox's best show. Ryan Hardy is the new Jack Bauer (24), even with 24 coming back. I highly suggest you watch this series!

0142407542|2.0|A snake slithering around in the winter time? Animals making fun of the gruffalo girl, because her father already/ most likely was afraid of a shadow and never found out about it? Of course, the gruffalo's child is as stupid as her dad, lets go of the mouse it caught just to let her call her big bad friend. The clever mouse uses the moon to cast it's huge shadow onto the snow, scares the gruffalo girl, who runs back to her cave and Daddy. Then the mouse suffers amnesia and discovers her footprints in the snow?! I did not get that - I admit. I obviously prefer books that teach my child about the world in a playful way (there is so much to know and discover!) or at least vocabulary and phonics, but even the text in this book is nothing outstanding or very catching.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is so well balanced,it is very difficult to write from eight different points of view but this author is very very skilled. I could not put this book down!!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves touching feel-good books!<br /><br />P.S it will most likely make you cry!!
B00BJKYM40|5.0|This is a funny book about an Alien coming to Earth to take up inside the body of a mathematician who dies and who has just solved a major maths problem that can have a big effect on humans.  The alien basically comes in with a distorted view of humans and has to make sure certain things happen and along the way he discovers more and more about humans.  It's a clever look at all of us from a different angle..  Funny start when the alien hasn't bothered to dress in clothes yet and is working on how to understand that phrase people use \\"get off the f....road you f....n wanker !\\"..  The story moves into the mathematician's family life and various dramas etc. along with some deep stuff at the end that was all very good but a bit preachy, but I was able to cope with that as it was so well written.  An interesting read and as stated, worth it to have a 'look at yourself' and all the humans from someone else's perspective.
1476727651|5.0|This book was very well done.  The slightly overly verbose comments from minor characters are there, classic King. His creativity is remarkable.  It is odd reading a sequel to a book I read as a sophomore in high school, and now I am an old man. Thanks for this one, Mr. King.  May I please have another?
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Better than the JOB series. Has the depth that the series lacks.<br />Can't wait to read A Dance With Dragons.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I saw this album performed live at Cornell.  I already knew the music upside down and backwards.  A fantastic concert, complete with their \\"Firebird\\" introduction.  I personally like Rick Wakeman's background synth embellishments.  This is one of my favorite Yes offerings.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Keeps me entertained. Grand kids like it. It's an awesome game . You get to spend quality time with someone.
B00B19G01C|4.0|Most of the cast was great. The stepdad seemed a litte bored. But all in all it was pretty good. I watch a lot of horror movies, it was nice not to be able to guess every next move like the Conjuring. Would recommend
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Requires time and patience. Kind of bad graphics but hey it's free right? Fun and slightly addicting. overall it's okay.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great story, I appreciate that story characters didn't disappoint. The story was a little slow in the beginning but delivered.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I had the app and then I had to upgrade it and when I did , I tried to open the app and it just said &quot; Facebook has stopped &quot; . This kept continuing several times . I even removed it from my device and tried again and it still happens . Can someone help me please ?
B009RX7IX8|5.0|It's a great program, and I like to review the past season to catch things missed on the original viewing.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Good series! Last book was harder to get into! Repetitive intimacy kinda did me in! Got old after a while! Other than that I finally finished them all!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game especially the fact that the background changes you should really get it!!!!<br />My cousins love this app it's actually their favorite. I really enjoy it too
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the solitaire app I use 99% of the time.  It is nicely difficult, moved smoothly and had nice options and choices to use.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Makes interesting shapes and colors.  On my kindle fire I doodle away some minutes while waiting or traveling.  And if you're good at it, the image can be saved for use elsewhere
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It is a nice app.  It takes a little to get use to it and to learn how to play it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I couldn't get it to work.  The chromecast people had me do this and that, but nothing helped.  They said they<br />would connect me with a more expert expert, and/or send me a replacement because maybe the one I had<br />was defective.  But they did neither, and I'm sitting here with nothing to show for what I paid.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It is a helpful app for the Kindle so I can take pictures.  There is a specific technique one has to learn in order to take a picture with a Kindle.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Easy to use and configure. Also nice look and feel. Downloaded when Amazon had it on promotion. Good, easy app.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great music, characters, and story line. Definitely going to become a classic that me and my husband turn to for entertainment.
B000XVT7SW|4.0|We do not lack good video options for the popular Italian double bill, and a viewer can choose from among two 1970s live performances with Domingo in both CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA and PAGLIACCI (one coupling from Tokyo and one from the Met), and Franco Zeffirelli's filmed versions, also with Domingo. All three of those discs have their virtues. The starriest \\"non-Domingo\\" option at present is this pair of 1960s Unitel films. No cinematic triumphs, their competitive strengths are the conducting and the filmed preservation of two deservedly famous portrayals and several worthwhile ones.<br /><br />Herbert von Karajan's contemporaneous studio recordings for Deutsche Grammophon feature a slightly different cast in CAV and a very different one in PAG. Here as there, he makes La Scala's orchestra sound like a major symphonic ensemble some years before the Abbado/Muti era, when such virtuosity could be taken for granted. The playing and choral singing offer a combination of color, beauty, grandeur, and power unmatched on the other DVDs, though the Met may have run it a closer race had their broadcast come a little later in James Levine's tenure. Karajan also turns up for a Hitchcock-style cameo as an improbable villager in PAG.<br /><br />The CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA is purported to have been based on a stage production by the great Giorgio Strehler. I cannot imagine that Åke Falck's facsimile of his work pleased him, if he ever saw it. This is, bluntly, inept moviemaking. When the soloists are not singing (as they often are not in a short opera padded with musical interludes), Falck unimaginatively fills the space with scenic shots -- flowers, rocks, a crucifix -- that do not establish atmosphere and are not effectively timed; there is no intrinsic rhythm to them. You may feel as though you are patiently bearing a slide show of a friend's uninteresting trip, but at least you would be able to tell a friend, \\"We've had that one already,\\" so you wouldn't see the same plant a thirdtime.<br /><br />Things improve only a little when the people show up. Lip-synching is poor, and the performers tend to be isolated from each another in one-shots. These are neither strong screen actors nor embarrassing ones, so when left to fend for themselves, as seems to be the case, they do not make much of an impression either way. The CAV film's redemption is in Fiorenza Cossotto's immaculately sung Santuzza, captured in fresher voice than for her Tokyo DVD performance with Domingo almost a decade later (there, her physical acting for the live audience is, shall we say, unconstrained). There was a line here, in the scene with Lola, when I thought to myself that she had it all in 1968, if that is the date of recording. The top is so sweet and free, soprano-like, that one might expect the bottom to go dusky -- not so, it is firm and assured. The musicianship with which she manages her considerable means is exacting as usual, and she convinces in acting with the voice, if less so with the face. The performers around Cossotto merit less discussion. The booklet note implies that Gianfranco Cecchele replaced Carlo Bergonzi, the Karajan audio recording's Turiddu, because Bergonzi was \\"never the strongest actor.\\" If so, Cecchele was not an upgrade in that department, and he sings less well, his mere serviceability making the opera seem more a mezzo vehicle than it should. Giangiacomo Guelfi offers a strong, conventional Alfio; Anna di Stasio makes a striking appearance but has a placid, almost nonreactive presence as Mamma Lucia. On the evidence here, she will not grieve Turiddu much after the opera, if the news of his death even sinks in.<br /><br />The better opera gets the better film in PAGLIACCI. Karajan himself is the credited auteur this time, from a staging by Paul Hager, and his pedestrian direction is more relevant than Falck's. Jon Vickers's Canio, even in this \\"canned\\" form, acting in a studio and miming to his own recording, is a portrayal of towering greatness. There is no condescension in it; he imbues Canio with all the pathos and anguish that distinguished his Tristan, Peter Grimes, and Otello (the last perhaps the closest parallel, for what is PAGLIACCI but a shorter, trashier OTELLO in which the wife really is guilty?). What Vickers does extremely well has as much to do with management and implication as it does with his roaring magnificently through the final scene. Early on, even when this Canio smiles at the crowd, you know he is not someone to be crossed. There is a brute strength about him, and a sense of menace never far from the surface. Vickers has a better cast around him than does Cossotto above. Raina Kabaivanska, I believe, would become more vocally fluent within this idiom than she is here, but she has a voice to be reckoned with, and her characterful face hints at Nedda's complex personality. Kabaivanska is especially good at the nastiness to Tonio as well as the marital interplay leading to the denouement, the mounting fear, then contempt and defiance, the desperate attempts to get the show-within-the-show back on track. She credibly fuels Vickers's rage. Peter Glossop is seen and heard in a brief prime as Tonio, making the most of opportunities opposite strong partners (he might have done more with the prologue); the ever-scrupulous Rolando Panerai seems a luxury as Silvio. Karajan, like Muti and few other conductors who have recorded the opera, thankfully assigns the famous last line to the \\"controlling\\" character, the baritone Tonio, as Leoncavallo intended.<br /><br />The productions, blamelessly \\"period\\" in their intentions, are unmistakably of their time. For Exhibit A, look to Santuzza's \\"'60s fabulous\\" wig in CAV. Picture and sound quality hold up well when their age are taken into consideration.

B000K78QVS|5.0|I've had this classic Vollenweider album on CD for many years but it's even more compelling on vinyl.  If you have a good turntable and appreciate good sound quality, this vintage Vollenweider is well worth the price of admission. This album is an audiophile favorite and a classic in it's own right.
1442366621|5.0|I really loved this bood.  I bought the Kindle version and the audio version.  I loved listening to it on my way to and from work each day.  I have been doing this diet for four weeks now and have lost 10 pounds.  It really hasn't been difficult at all.  I think it is easier for me to just not eat most of the day.  I eat the same thing on fast days which is a protein drink for breakfast and then a salad with chicken for tuna for dinner.  I just keep telling myself I can eat tomorrow.  That is so helpful.  Please read or listen to this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm doing it and losing weight.  Woo Hoo.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|For those of us who are diabetic this book is a must read, especially if your A1c is greater than 5.4. You are at risk for dementia and/or Alzheimer's disease.  If your waist is 40\\"male or 35\\" female you are at risk.  And if you consume soda (sugar) as well as allot of carbohydrates you are at risk.  Read this book, your mind and your body will benefit, but only if you change what got you to this state of ill health.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|As usual angry birds is full of fun - new games, new look, new birds with cool powers - something different and exciting for a now classic game.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is very FUN but I recommend not playing this at night if you have a fear of the dark<br />But still it is very FUN
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Much easier way to find files I have downloaded and installed than trying to decipher the complicated hidden workings of Kindle through the Amazon system - still need to figure how to update what I have downloaded since Kindle sends a message that the program is already on the device even if you hit select to update and replace - one issue at a time - but this app is awesome and easy to use.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great quick workouts. These target your entire body so you make the most of 20 minutes. Each level has something new and different so you don't get bored. I highly recommend!
B007FIY3VW|3.0|For free it's just okay.  I was always having a problem trying to save my changes to Google Docs and I don't subscribe to Drop Box so that became an issue.  When I make changes to a document I don't like spending 30 minutes trying to navigate through an app to figure out how to do something as simple as saving my progress.<br /><br />Another weird thing was that one of the PDF files I had been using in a different office program - when pulled up in Olive now had a strike-through effect on all of my writing.  I tried everything I could to get rid of it to no avail.  I contacted customer support many times regarding the issues and was never contacted back.  I recently purchased Documents to go Pro and transferred the files I was working on into that program - the strike-through thing is gone and this app is much more user friendly.  If you are poor and just need something this is OK, if you really need an app to use occasionally for business purposes - professional or personal - I would suggest looking elsewhere unless you have time to waste.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|It is so great that I will use it so u need to make more like it. I will continue
B008LH4YYC|4.0|Have to say I was very disappointed about apps that were not available on the new Kindle Fire HD - Amazon doesn't have the selection or the competitive price of google as of yet - the app was great to get some apps and other things on my Kindle that I needed for it to be a more productive machine.
B000NY17J6|5.0|This is an excellent CD with plenty of songs (23). To me it's a real bargain, and the sound quality is also excellent. This is a \\"collector's item\\" to me. Highly recommended.
B008RTE066|5.0|I bought this as a gold box deal. I probably wouldn't have gotten it otherwise, as i have the mono box set, and several mono copies of the original album, and i much prefer Help or Hard Days Night as movies. But i am happy with it. I don't have a Blu Ray player, and have no plans to buy one, but my computer is Blu Ray 'capable', so maybe i will upgrade my dvd player. (Blu ray players are obsolete technology on Windows 8, which doesn't support it or dvd, but all you need is love, and a downloadable program). The little soundtrack is cool: 2 7&#34; EP's, mono, gatefold jacket just like the original. A nice addition to anyone's collection.,
B004IYISSK|5.0|This novel is not only beautifully written but it is also a page-turner. The reader gets completely engrossed in the stories and he can understand as well as appreciate each character as the story develops. Amy Tan does a terrific job. If you are looking for a moving yet skillfully written book, you won't regret buying this one.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending to decades of reading.....on to something new.....<br /><br />This series would make a great tv movie series.  Christian bale as rand?
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I needed something to read PDF files reliably on the tablet and this does the job. Can't say anything better than that.
B00755MHV8|4.0|This is fresh and inventive  -  always good to be reminded not to be caught up in &#34;the firm&#34; at the expense of who you really are / could be.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game. The flow is great and there is not a l o t of lag time. I like that there is always something going on.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|Who would think that possible?  I know that I think of those subjects as dry, but Dawkins' writing style makes this book quite fun to read.  While you may not learn anything new about those subjects, the book is packed with other facts from example scenarios and explanations that you are sure to find interesting!
B00ECLU346|2.0|I don't recommend this movie to anyone except you really don't have anything else to watch! The story was horrible and the movie was hard to watch!
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|This app is a great photo editing app! The effects that you can do to your photos are really cool. However, I was slightly disappointed that you can't write on the photos like I could in my last photo-editing app. All in all, it is a pretty great app. :)<br />(Also I got this app when it was the free app of the day so that was an added bonus)
0743486285|5.0|this is a great book about a rockstar who is living life like there is no tomorrow. you really find what drugs are capable of and how they destroy people
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game and with the updates it just keeps getting better and better and if you can't afford the pc version it's even better
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|It was a good movie. It was a little overdone and left nothing to the imagination. I plan on buying the earlier movies too. Good story.
0761172726|5.0|We have been using this calendar for many years now, and still love it!  For a traditional wall calendar, it is really excellent.  Keeping us all organized (5 people, 2 pets).  At a glance I can see who needs to be where, what is going on, etc. on any given day in the month.  It is very functional.  I saw some comments on the \\"slickness\\" of the paper.  We normally use Pen to add to the calendar.  I have used pencil, and I can see how some may not find it as usable if you are making constant changes.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This by far is one of the best books I've ever read. Worth every penny. I couldn't put it down.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Saw the farewell tour live in state college BJC. This movie is exactly like being there! Loved the addition of the vintage footage!
B00EMAGCJM|2.0|agree with some of other reviewers that only 4 interesting tracks on this album,  im disappointed. aside from the new sexual image she put out trying to catch attention, I thought the quality of her new album would also catch peoples' attention, but I guess not. Miley, u should focus on a good album next time!!!
1476727651|5.0|Although there may be books I've enjoyed more, I still think King is one of the best storytellers out there. He immediately sucks you in and doesn't let go till it's over, and he drafts some of the most vivid characters out there. I really enjoyed Doctor Sleep. I reread The Shining a couple months ago in anticipation of it, and although it's not necessary to have read The Shining before this one, to get the most out of the book, I recommend one do so. The only thing I was hesitant about with this book is the fact that children were the victims. But other than one page devoted to a description of how the True Blood gets their 'steam,' a page which I found very difficult to read, King dances around the issue and avoids bombarding the reader with gratuitous violence against young kids. The focus instead is on Danny and his teenage accomplice, and how they must confront the roving True Blood 'family.' All around a great read for King fans.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I can't believe this is by J.K. Rowling. Couldn't put down Harry Potter, had a hard time picking this up. Not an enjoyable read for me
B0089LOG02|3.0|Great for the beach or airplane - easy to follow and sweet.  Not overly deep or stimulating but a solid and decent book
B00008WT5E|5.0|Stands alone as the primal and staid quintessential work of AC/DC. Eddie Van Helen's favorite album from the Australian quartet. With Bon Scott on vocals - at his very best.
B008MVPHP2|5.0|I wear 10 5m us in all shoes and boots,if the shoe is in whole sizes i always go up to 11.I read reviews but i will say i dont pay much attention with the size reviews.I noticed so many reviews seem to be off.I never owned pair crocs and decided to purchase a pair and happy i did.They are true to size.Woman sizes i dont know anything about but if your a guy get regular size if you wear half size like myself just go up half size,they will fit.Thanks amazon and all hard workers always make my day.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Why is it not available for kindle fire hd 8.9 I had to get a new one am I'm disapointed
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit ninja and the quality is nice. It is easy to play and it is a game for everyone.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to use and fun.  Good graphics, sound annoying but I turned it off for use.  Not good for children. Would like choice of tiles
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like the type of game that it is, but you need internet to play and since I do not always have that option, it is not the game for me.
B008MM9630|4.0|I purchased this free game Fairy Farm last night. It is a very cute game and very easy to play. I plan on allowing my daughter to also play
B00186JBT6|4.0|splendid interpretations by a great artist.  A great selection of baroque music. Many hours of musical delight! I found no flaws or repetitions. Excellent quality production almost as good as Archiv.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|IT was very disappointing to see that there were no English subtitles in it. I was assuming that it would be there and did not bother to check. This should have been really available.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|This is a cute movie. Great for kids of all ages.  Nicolas Cage voice a draw for big kids too.
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|It was as described although the cd was extremely hard to remove from the case and the case broke in the process but that's not your fault.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Recommend to vampire enthusiasts or anyone who just likes to drool over hot guys.  Hope Damian is around for a long time to comeqq
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Had to fidget with it a little bit to get it to receive charge, but overall it does the job.
B0031RS64G|4.0|A great start to the series, however not an easy read. The story jumps around too often when not necessary. What I mean is, instead of changing point of view for suspense (cliff hangers) or a new chapter, the POV changes many times for no apparent reason. It can be a little jarring.<br /><br />Another thing that prevents the fifth star is the over description of some things (such as city locations) and vague descriptions of creatures and people. I think races are brushed over too much while sometimes I felt like I was reading a street directory.<br /><br />Overall my gripes are minor and the writing improves in the second book.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Great game for the kindle Fire HD excellent sound and surprisingly good graphics. And fun to. Great way to kill time waiting at the doctors office or train station.
B000VR824S|5.0|Another great dvd super line up of artists good sound and picture quality many songs you don't hear much well worth it
B000KKPN5C|5.0|My SB-400 is a very simple, very high quality flash with all the features I actually use. It's small, but not cheap and It works extremely well with my Nikon D5000. And the best thing about this flash is that it recharges (recycles) faster after every shot than the built-in flash.<br />Pros:<br />Small<br />Lightweight<br />Cheap<br />Faster recycle time<br />Cons:<br />Angle for bouncing light are limited<br />No sideways tilt, however you can overcome it by little imagination ;)

Their niece marriages a Muslim, breaking the family's claims to being all Catholic and all Bavarian all in one go.<br /><br />In a world where survival is still primary and thriving secondary 3 generations of a family needs to learn to grow, accept and stop with manipulating others which is now as much part of their make up as their previous belief systems.<br /><br />A detailed descriptive book of hope.<br /><br />WaAr
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I got the free app and did not like it.  It was not loud enough and did not loop properly.  I was reluctant to try this, but when at a hotel and hoping for some white noise, I paid for the premium app.  It is much better.  The sound was better, and it properly looped all night. I like the pink noise and brown noise. I also like the rain and wind sounds. Good for the price.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story was truly awesome. It really touched me emotionally. I cried and laughed and cried some more. It also made me really think. It is a well-written beautiful story.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game was quick to grasp, and very addictive once started. The execution of the puzzle concept was quite nice snd a lot more fun in electronic form than the versions in puzzle books. Recommended. I should divulge that, though honest, my review is just to get the bonus round unlocked. Maybe thst's a reccie right there!
B00CKKG2PU|4.0|I love this show, but as I am watching the end of season four I no longer have any love or sympathy for Alicia's character.  Her husband did wrong and I think he has made up for it, so she needs to choose.  In my opinion she is just as guilty as he is of cheating and she acts like a spoiled high school girl who can't make up her mind between the jock and the egghead.  Figure it out Alicia and stick to it.....you are supposed to be the Good Wife not the good separated wife that has a boyfriend.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Each chapter promises to blow you away.  Can't put it down once you start. Read DU and Immortal Realityf first.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|Love, love, this music. It brings back many memories of times past. Was my favorite when it was released and remains so.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books way different from the regular romance novels I usually read but fantastic. I'm sad that I finished all the books in a week's time and have to find something else to read. Cannot wait till E L James writes another great story.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I  am 53 years &#34;old&#34; and have long been a Star Trek fan. I wasn't &#34;sure&#34; at first if I would like this new cast of characters, but I was wrong. This movie is 100 % awesome. I won't ruin the movie for you, but there is one scene where I actually shed tears. And this has never happened while watching a Star Trek movie.<br />But don't &#34;worry&#34;, The Enterprise, as always, comes out a winner.<br /> I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys Star Trek movies and science fiction action movies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so so so addictive! Its a great time passer and even time consuming. I dont ever want to put it down!
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I have been a Devo fan since the early 80's. After all these years they have produced yet another winner. I have loved this CD in it's entirety since receiving it.<br />The music is 100 % Devo in style. It is excellent and I have no regrets about having purchased it.<br />&#34;Yes&#34; I most certainly have and do recommend this Cd to my friends and family, as well as to all of you &#34;Spud Heads&#34;.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Love the Beatles and Rubber Soul cd!!!!<br /><br />Why can't they write songs like that these days?  Especially love Norwegian Wood song!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Yet another action packed Iron Man movie. Full of action, comedy, and it holds your interest.<br />I recommend this movie to all of my family, friends and to you !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love subway suffers and I recommend this game to any kid or teen that likes running games
B002WV5A9G|4.0|This crew doesn't disappoint us Star Trek fans. And I fully enjoyed watching it.<br />I recommend this to all. Great viewing and excitement at every turn.
B004C00EKU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I also purchased another copy for a family member as a birthday present.  It has a lot of great stars in it.
0895260131|5.0|This book is so informative and packed with accurate information concerning the global threat Islam poses to all non-Islamic people. I was impressed by the Authors researched information and the interest this book produces.
B0018O4YSQ|1.0|one of the few movies that I don't like. It is dark, makes no sense and I turned it off after 30 minutes. Maybe later on I will try to watch it again and I will like it but I doubt it.
B00B8YSIMY|3.0|Three stars seems generous but I did like the headlong pace of this story. I had hoped to see the author bring to life Marbella and the Costa del Sol because I had been there this summer. The story could have happened pretty much anywhere on a sunny tourist beach town. Similarly the characters were uni-dimensional and flat. They were either beautiful people taking drugs or ugly functional people.<br /><br />I didn't mind the lack of editing that much because I was interested in what would happen next in the slowly approaching train wreck that was the character's life. So that's why I call it enjoyable.  It really moved and gave me a window into a world I will never know.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|I have read dozens of leadership books over the years, and Good to Great is in my top five. If you are interested in becoming a truly great leader, this statistically backed book should be on your bookshelf..
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This book really was a great read from start to finish. Seriously hard to it down once you start reading
B00AJCTY8S|5.0|I was lucky enough to stumble onto Kodaline using the soundwave app. A person I was following was listening to the album a lot and I decided to check them out. I fell in love with All I Want and was really excited for the new album to finally be released in the U.S. Some of the songs have been released on previous EPs but the new songs like All Comes Down and Big Bad World have become my favorites. Stephen Garrigan's vocals give me chills. They are currently doing a U.S. tour and the tickets were a great price so I went to see them yesterday. They sound just as good live and are very friendly guys who really seem to care about their fans. Try this album and you might really like it!
B00A285OOW|3.0|Detail is good.  This was my first Phillippa Gregory book, so I may just not be used to her style
1451626657|3.0|I'd always been fascinated to read this book, whose reputation seems to have gone before it - & whose title of course has become indelibly embedded into our language.<br /><br />It's a lengthy, experimental (for its time) & often extremely funny read - but you need an incredible amount of patience & indulgence to stay the course of this voluminous book.<br /><br />It tells the story of Yossarian - a world-weary America fighter pilot stationed on an island off the coast of Italy during WW2, & centres on his brushes with authority & ways of coping with the thought that death could easily be around the corner any day... as his superior, the cold & feckless Col Cathcart, forever increases the squadron's missions.<br /><br />For what seemed like the whole of the first half, there appeared to be no plot at all - just chapter after chapter introducing a new & increasingly bizarre & baffling array of characters who just seem to get on each others nerves in an overlong series of set-pieces.<br />But, if you can get to the second half, the book levels out & a story of sorts does emerge, along with an underlying anti-war message that resonates towards the end.<br /><br />I'm glad I've read this book (I think!) but I can't say I loved it - it obviously had a new & satirical edge when it was published in the early 1960s, but that now seems rather dated. Despite the piled-on humor, it isn't always as funny as it thinks it is either.<br />But, all in all, it's worth it if you can stay with it, & there are certainly echoes here of the claustrophobia & humor of M*A*S*H (& even classic British World War 1 comedy series Blackadder Goes Forth) to come perhaps. There are also some well-observed insights into the human condition, & into the insanity & futility of war itself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it you so should really get it because if it's Halloween or some season it will change that season·
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|A very interesting look at the superhero genre. Brandon Sanderson is a master world builder, and Steelheart is no exception. You will feel like you are right next to the rebels fighting Steelheart's forces.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was a really good read and would recommend this to anyone 13 and up. I can't wait for the second book to come out!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|If you enjoy the antics of the characters on Big Bang Theory, then you will enjoy adding this to your collection. Enjoyed every episode and the writing is as clever as always.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I got this for my husband and he loved it! You can really configure it into all cars from all 3 films. Nice quality and is exactly how it was shown on the box.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is very fun I love that it is free and that it keeps me ocuppide for a long time. This app I would recommend to everyone. I love all of the different levels and how you have to get missions completed in order to keep going and have fun. Hope that whoever gets this app next will enjoy it as much as I do.
B006MPKAOI|3.0|At first the changing timelines was confusing and distracted from the character and plot development, but about a quarter of the way through it all starts to come together cleverly. I think the OCD aspect as an onset from a traumatic event is well written. I would have liked to know more about Lee as I found his character hard to believe in parts. I would read more from this author. The ending wrapped it all up a bit too nicely.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|I watch this funny movie over and over,Matthew Broderick at his best I give this movie a A+ you will enjoy this Film
B00992CF6W|3.0|I thank there should be villagers and caves,indermen,portals and wether changes and dogs,wolf's and more solts to play on line
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My 2 yr old absolutely loves this! There are so many options for interaction with the story. The scenes and characters are adorably creepy. And the extra games outside of the story keep her interested and engaged. Very very happy with this purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun i love playing it so much 24/7<br />i tjink that it is a fun and challenging games exspesially when it comes to the myster boxes so exciting
1607066017|5.0|A modern twist on Romeo and Juliet, but also a fantasy world vs. scifi world battle.  Worth reading and makes me excited to receive volume 2.
B00B2166BS|4.0|PRO;  It works.  Faster charge than with supplied USB port/charger. My mini USB was bent a bit by constant plug in & out. This is a better way to charge.<br /><br />CONS;  Short cable,  magnet not as strong as I hoped. Sometimes it gets knocked off.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Birds with Jedi Mind powers aids in knocking down near by objects that are slightly out of reach. Great levels and just enough help where the game is not spoiled.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of the ESV as a translation, but this is certainly a good edition to have at hand, particularly for in-depth study. The notes are extensive, and there are numerous links to further information online. It's nice to see the publishers bringing God's word into the 21st century!<br /><br />The Kindle version handles well, except for one gripe: each chapter (not book) and article has an individual entry in the pop-up contents page, making it a ridiculously long-winded exercise just to scroll through hundreds of entries to navigate to another passage using the pop-up contents.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great story, better than the original series, which I loved.  The writers were really on the ball on this one
B002FOQY2M|5.0|So I bought this like 3 weeks after I bought some nights and it was like 6 months ago (weird but I bought SN on the lead singers birthday lol) I really loved some nights but this is got me really obsessed u may say I mean I'm 14 and in the fun.dom (in eng fandom) this is what charmed me in I prefer this over some nights I love them equally tho put your headphones on with out disturbance listen it thru u can relate or go on an adventure. If u r a synthiser like me (it's a disorder look it up) u will have a GREAT time listening to walking the dog( b sure to find vid) My fave album of all time in a nutshell because u can c the pure genius on Nate ruess on this album, as they say in a few interviews \\"they try to impress each other on A&I\\"
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Liked this story, loved the original series, bit this is even better than the original!!  Hope it keeps up for more movies
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Stayed on the edge of my seat through the whole thing!  I grew up on the original Star Trek so it's great to see those original characters brought back to life!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Good blends of sic-if and conventional stories.  Enjoyed the whole movie, great action shots, and consistently a good story,  keep it ip
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun to play and very entertaining. The graphics are amazing and I love the unicorns! Very fun
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great, wonderful Christian story, nothing offensive in this movie!!!!  Such a relief to watch something without offensive scenes or words
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Even though this was a freebie there wasn’t much too it unless I either bought things or<br />participated in surveys etc.  Had to cancel the game.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I can't figure out how to use this app. The interface is not user-friendly. It does do include instructions or the goals of the app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I is a really fun game to play for if your bored. It has all kinds of prizes .If want to get a new game this I s the one
0449911357|4.0|I love the movie \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" (with Mary Louise Parker, Mary Stuart Masterson, & Kathy Bates, among others) and have watched and enjoyed it numerous times, but this was the first time I read the book.<br /><br />I have to say that the book is a delightful accompaniment to the movie (I know, I should say that the book is so much better, blah, blah, but honestly I think that both are good in their own right). The movie focuses mainly on the four main female characters, while the book includes the stories of many more diverse characters. This can be both a benefit and a drawback: To some degree, the multitude of characters in the book can get a little overwhelming. However, it was interesting to read more about the perspectives of the large black community, military members and others that aren't examined as thoroughly in the excellent (but shorter) movie version.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the folksy, Southern style of writing and the detail of the characters in the novel by Fannie Flagg. I enjoyed comparing and contrasting the lives of the characters in the book to those in the movie and learning more about their backgrounds than is revealed in the movie itself. Definitely recommend, even if (or especially if) you've already seen the movie version of the story.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Lightweight 1.5 X 1 X 4 inch high quality plastic box with 4 USB 3.0 ports and a blue LED line across the top to let you know whether it's on or off, attached to a very heavy duty 1 foot cord with a durable USB 3.0 female connector to attach to your computer or other device.  I can plug it in to a port on my laptop and set it behind the monitor where I can plug all of my small devices in to recharge., or take it with me and use an Anker wall connector so that one outlet in my hotel room will charge four devices. In the same way, I can use it in the car or with my Anker external battery recharger in a pinch. I am a big fan of Anker products because they are always reasonably priced and I know I can count on the quality. AND, they make all the gadgets I want or need.  I do have a tip. If you're plugging this unit into a USB 2.0 port, the fit may be a little loose, loose enough to cause the unit to lose connection.  In a USB 3.0 port of course, there is no problem
1594489505|5.0|I could only hope that this is made a requirement for all high school students. Without revealing the plot, it teaches us compassion, love, hope, karma, atoning, and friendship. The world needs more of this.
141694737X|5.0|A great book for a toddler's library. The animal containers open to disclose the animals sent from the zoo. Great fun for both the child and the adult.
B0071QIN00|3.0|sometimes this game can be challenging. it also shuts down alot on my kindle fire. i will play this once in a while.

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love the game just as much as the video but with the one that vomit is too hard on the kindle fire because the screen too big. And the plane one doesn't work either. Other than those two thing the game is very good I love it.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|As a lover of gritty vocals, blues based rock, and excellent musicianship, you need look no further than Krokus. They still have that nasty 70's feel. Some people just don't appreciate basic rock music, and say it's prehistoric. Well if that's the case, then I'll be draggin' my knuckles 'till the day I die. Krokus just keep producing great music. I'll recommend this to people who love to rock,....
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I recommend it all the time !  My Daughter-in-law even used it in her book club.
B0087SLR2W|4.0|Good movie. Good storyline although a little over dramatic at times. I thought the effects were really good. Gives you a sense of what the Tuskegee Airman had to overcome.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|To my delight this item was sent to me at no charge because the one that came with my Kindle failed - your Customer Service is excellent.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So far it is doing a great job.  It is keeping my kindle running clean.  It is easy to use.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My wife said it was great, she loved if.  Worth every penny of its purchase price.  Would buy again.  Great.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is just like temple run only despicable me! My kids love playing it a lot&hellip;so much it gets annoying.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie has a bit of everything.  Great for the family and humorous.  It shows how the family needs to be involved together and how God can help us through when things don't quite work out like we expected.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  The acting was good and the story line was great.  Will smith and his son Jeden make a great team
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is a lot of fun, easy to lose time playing. The only thing I would change is to have different items appear on each level. Mix it up a bit I mean.
3438052229|5.0|I would recommend this book for any Hebrew student or scholar. It's light and small and easy to carry everywhere
B00594XOZU|1.0|This is the worst app I have ever downloaded. It always says it's taking too long to load, and I can't even make an account. So DO NOT waist your time downloading this awful app. It's AWFUL.<br />If I could I wouldn't even give this app any stars, that hoe AWFUL this app is.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I don't understand the harsh criticism on this movie.  It was a good no-brainer action movie.  I think expectation management was a failure on most reviewers.  I went into this movie already seeing several trailers.  I knew one; phenomenal graphics, two; cool world aliens, three; survival movie on a crazy planet.  I also knew there were few actors.  This movie was a great movie to watch with the kids.  In fact, even if you don't watch it with kids I recommend you watch it anyways!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought this book was so amazing I loved it so much! Great story! And I think that if I could rate this book I would give it 5 stars
B00E0SX118|3.0|AS THE stars show, it is ok.  Had the potential of being so much better.  The Previews made the movie look so much better than it really was.<br /><br />Good Luck America
0812983459|5.0|This book showed that we need to keep working on our relationships. Being married 40 some years is not a time to stop communicating with a partner. Each one's needs changes over time and we need to talk about those changes and why they happen.<br /><br />Our book club liked it and the discussion was very good, especially about the different characters that Harold meets on his way to see Queenie.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|So we purchased it this morning, which of course was a bunch of money due to it being a new release.  I let the kids take some time off of chores and we watched the movie together.  It was good.  Typical college campus life portrayed in an animated way.. with monsters that is..<br /><br />The kids loved the movie, John Goodman and Billy Crystal really are talented.  With many years between the 1st monster movie and this one, you would have thought, the movie to be some political showdown as most are now a days.  Yet this was not and was a great movie. I would recommend it.  Even my four year old liked it.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|The story of how life unfolds when committed to ideals, despite the odds and against popular public sentiment.  The issue of slavery required committed  people  to  speak truth to power.  Very well told, very believable acting.
B006LSZECO|1.0|the ending of this book was an enormous cop out, ruined the whole novel for me. Greatly disappointed by it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. the graphics are awesome. I love creating my town and being in charge ofnwhat happens after the Oregon trail.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't wait until the next one. It was thrilling and raw. It seems like each storyline is more interesting than the last.<br />  There is a tendency to skip the action and tell about it in flashbacks. I find this a little bothersome.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Can't imagine how a worse movie could be made. bad story line, bad if non-existent acting, horrible CG, etc. If I had seen this at the movie theater I would have demanded my money back! My wife and I wish we could give this POS less than 1 star...
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Why did you stop there needs to be more to this story please . I read all the books and when it was over it was upsetting
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I love the style of this controller; more like the Xbox model. It is extremely comfortable. I had a problem with the first one I ordered but the company learned of my difficulty and went above and beyond to make it right. I am extremely impressed with seller Kiddie World and with the Pro Elite Controller and I will be purchasing another as well. The product arrived promptly, was well protected and the representatives provided amazing customer service. I'm very impressed!
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|Everyone in the band is incredible. Richie Kotzen's Voice is phenomenal and reminiscent of Chris Cornell. With great rememberable melodies, songwriting and outstanding musicianship that could rival rush whats not to love.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Very enjoyable! The only thing I would have to say is that I was tired of her breaking up with him so often ha.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This movie is great, it is a more modern edge movie of Mary Poppins. these lil deviant kids turn out finally behaving after they get the nanny they deserve.
B0000696ID|5.0|This movie is a hit, because the love bond this child and alien have is amazing!  I love it !!!!
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Great show, with a good mix of fun, message and reality. Includes several ingredients of real live in América today

B001NLKZUA|5.0|The characters are like able. I want to see how story ends. I have next book down loaded already. My daughter and I are both reading this series. We Love talking about it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great free app. I love the ease of play and the overall feel. I would certainly recommend to anyone.
B003719G40|5.0|Excellent book. I would recommend everyone read this book. This book could save many relationships. I look forward to reading other books by Gary D Chapman
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I usually don't read books just because someone else and liked it, but this one was free and had so many good reviews I had to read it. It was one of those stories I guessed what was around the corner every time. Not that I don't like that, but it wasn't very exciting. I thought for having almost 3,000 reviews and being rated at 4 stars it would be better, but I was disappointed. I NEVER write reviews and am usually pretty generous when I do as far as rating, but unless you're really bored, don't waste your time. Sorry!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Seriously, the media and it's official movie critics are, as usual, way off. This is a great movie. Don't hesitate on sitting down for 2 hours with your favorite snack to watch this! It's GREAT. My wife wanted to pass it over just because of media movie \\"experts\\" and their stupid opinion. She liked it. Just read all the other thousands of likes on amazon.. It's a great movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get it! It is rally fun . I built a Manson in survival. You can go to the nether. Minecraft it is a really nice game. Get it now.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I really don't like to read however this is one book I actually finished. So naturally I had to watch the movie. I loved it! The characters were perfect and it lived up to the book!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Its not letting me log in and for some reason its letting use it on my sister ipod but its not working for my kindle firehd  and this glitch needs to be fixed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good game. Really addivtive though love the colourings and the world tour series very good game. Great game for kids as well .AMAZING!!!

B00594XOZU|4.0|Like every one else has said, it won't let me log on and I really enjoy this app so can you please fix this? Thank youuu
0307277887|2.0|More satisfying than the TV show. I little slower and very different in terms of story in that it's slightly more believable and unsettling.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|It does what it says it does.  Must have app for Kindle HD if you want to watch flash player based video clips on the Net.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love being able to see NetFlix and YouTube on my Chromecast. I would love to have more streaming options available to me. Works great.  There are a couple of hiccups causing me to start over when it doesn't know where to play the video, but overall this is a compact, and most efficient item. I highly recommend it.
B004LX0D36|4.0|I'm reading classics on my bucket list, and I enjoyed this book. Jane Austen's stories of course,<br />must be dealt with in the context of her era ... dating and marriage norms were very different<br />then, and her use of the English language can be a stretch because we Americans have lost<br />the art. For those two reasons I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good love story<br />(I like happy endings) and who wants to stretch their vocabulary and understanding.  Lots of<br />commonality with &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; which I also liked. I best liked buying this read fo $.99!<br />Thanks Amazon!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|A very well designed game. I'm docking a star because some of the special vehicles get on my nerves, but otherwise, great game. Check it out.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Excellent except in places it gets too technical. The story of the evolution of cancer therapy is fascinating. A little too long.
081297381X|5.0|The sub-title of this book would easily be &#34;how to make challenging subjects accessible to the general public&#34;. The thing is, an understanding of these challenging subjects is vital for us all as individual members of society, but they are generally treated as the sole preserve of academics and &#34;experts&#34;, and the general public is encouraged to &#34;trust me, I'm a banker&#34;... Well, we all know what that's worth now - but what is the alternative? Taleb provides us with the ideal one. He  adopts a discursive approach: you feel as though he is merely talking to you from the pages of the book. He follows Einstein's precept: Make everything as easy as possible; but no easier. This book is like a work-out for the mind, stretching and strengthening it, providing us with the knowledge and the arguments necessary to challenge the so-called &#34;experts&#34;, identify their vested interests, understand how we are being manipulated and resist that manipulation. This book is a vital tool for anyone living in the 21st century.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|This book is a very revealing story of the heart and psych of  the man who became the President of the United States.
0156027321|5.0|Some of the best contemporary writing around. Gripping, enthralling, puzzling; enlightening as regards the human condition. One of the best examples of post-modern writing (showing plainly that one doesn't have to be afraid of post-modernists: they can write books as engaging and absorbing as anyone else). From the purely literary point of view, the structure is perfect, a thing of beauty.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|&#34;Now You See Me&#34; works as long as you suspend yourself in disbelief, try not to overthink it, and forget about how implausible it is.  This is popcorn cinema at its finest - the kind of movie that entertains while not being overtly deep.  It's the kind of film Roland Emmerich used to make back in the heyday of 1990s blockbuster cinema.<br /><br />The movie starts with the supposed heist seen in the trailer.  As the story unfolds, Mark Ruffalo's character is trying to chase down the magicians and we are constantly trying to figure out how these feats were done, whose on whose side, and are appropriately kept on the edge of our seats while trying to do so.<br /><br />The film works because of the actors, a fun (but albeit highly implausible) screenplay, and some really tight pacing.  The over the top tricks allow for a good show and the choice of actors is great.  Jess Eisenberg and Woody Harleson are easily the most fun to watch in this.  Then there's the neat little twist in the end, which, admittedly, the film didn't need, but it works.<br /><br />I highly recommend this because it's so much fun to watch.  Just don't take it too seriously.  I miss a popcorn movie done well.  There are dozens of dumb, formulaic, repetitive popcorn films coming out nearly every week, but this one is different.  It's clever and doesn't try to be over intelligent.  You just have to watch it from that perspective, and you'll have fun.
0871164566|5.0|This book has some super designs. Lots of information and know how packed into this book. Great book to have to get you going on creative designs and your own ideas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game soo much! The only bad thing is when it updates it takes like 5 minutes to load, but totally worth it!
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|The hangover III was a very funny movie---a little dark at times,- but overall enjoyable.  Laughed hard at the end of the movie---very unexpected ending.
B0041VT6H2|5.0|This movie is wild and crazy just like the comics. Josh broken is great as hex and jimmy hayward homages spaghetti westerns and the comics well. The movie enters a sort of trashy greatness which is perfect for a hex movie. Give it a watch and then pick up the comics.
B007REV4T8|4.0|We have enjoyed all the many James Bond movies. This one was no exception. A movie with plenty of action and yes true to the Bond mentality, plenty of female action too
B00ANY94A0|5.0|The set came very soon after ordering.The set is cute.Hoping my granddaughter will like it for Christmas. Bought another set too.
0061124265|5.0|I am addicted to Paulo Coelho's books and I met this book particularly when I really needed. It made me think about who really I am, what I really want and how society wants to shape me or all of us. Great addition to my collection
B00B7VZN76|5.0|What can I say, I am a trekkie and not too much can compare to TNG. While I love/like all of the different series that they have produced so far, TNG is probably the best. Acting, directing and pretty much everything about it was good. Of course not every episode is not a 10, but overall it was a great season.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch gets better and better. Thanks Michael for continuing this series. It's also an interesting possibility that his daughter is getting setup to continue the legacy. Love that idea. Maybe Haller's daughter can join her. Wouldn't that be fun?
0143123173|5.0|Those who are viewers of the A & E television series, Longmire, will recognize the characters in “The Cold Dish” because this is the book that started it all.  This is the book that kicked off the Sheriff Walt Longmire series of mysteries.  In this book, Johnson created an unusual protagonist reminiscent of Marshal Sam McCloud from the old television series McCloud.  The difference being that Johnson did not take his hero out of his world and transplant him in the concrete jungle, instead he invites us into his world... Wyoming.  Johnson is often heard to say that he went against conventional wisdom by basing his tale in the least populated county of the least populated state.  In so doing, he brings us into a world that most of us will otherwise never see.<br /><br />Longmire is a unique blend of the old western and modern crime story.  In the process it creates a sort of “New Western” genre.  “The Cold Dish” is a genuinely enjoyable book bringing in equal parts of gritty realism and light hearted humor and overlaying it with seriously dark humor.  The character development is of a superb quality I have not seen since “Lost Boys” by Orson Scott Card.  You will very quickly find yourself captivated by the complex characters that Craig Johnson creates and the complicatedly simple world they inhabit.<br /><br />If you watch the TV series you will recognize the basic plot line of this book, but don't assume you know the full story.  This Longmire mystery will keep you guessing until the end.  It is always a joy to discover a book with a set of characters you really enjoy and know that there are another 7 or 8 books beyond the one you have just finished.  That is the case of “The Cold Dish” and the Walt Longmire world.<br /><br />Reviewed by J. Keith Jones<br />Author of In Due Time
B00992CF6W|4.0|If it wasn't for the fact that there are few servers, if not none at all, this would have been an easy five stars. Otherwise an awesome app!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Best concert I seen in years !!! I would recommend this dvd to every one she's amazing  thts why she's the Queen
1435140745|5.0|Don't let the previous review fool you. If you are buying this edition you have probably read this book already and are looking for a more ornamental edition, this serves that purpose and then some. I will review the product based on the condition of this edition, not based on my opinion of the story within.The book is sturdily bound in fine orange leather featuring ornamentation around the edges that resembles the decretive nature of a fine Quran. On the front cover, spine, and back cover feature very cool renderings of Arrakis at night, a Fremen in full desert garb, and sandworms on the dunes. The pages are thin and leafed with a silver like material which serves as another fine detail  and helps to make this edition a rather stately and handsome thing to look at on the shelf. In addition to this, there is also a gold string built into the binding that acts as a book mark so you won't have to worry about damaging the book while you pause in your reading. All and all, this book is beautiful and finally offers an affordable option to those who seek an attractive leather bound edition of this great work of science fiction. Regardless of whether you like the story itself, this is still a wonderful edition that any fan of the series would enjoy having on their shelf.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|I love the plot it has you guessing all the way, this movie is also very funny I would highly recommend it to all that like twist and turns....
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Fantastic album, loved the music want all their material to be of equal craft in the future, one of my favorite groups!!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|this movie has one of the best  villians  star trek memory movie was excellent and I highly recommend to all sci fi fan
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|We loved this movie  Great fun. Action moves quickly  I think it is a good family movie for a cold fall/winter night
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. I love the details, it makes you feel apart of the story. Great job E.L. James
B001DF68MA|5.0|The seat was easy to install and is very secure.  My daughter always asks to go bikeriding when she sees it.  She is 18 months and fits in the seat well.  Out of the package it does look small, but she has alot of room to grow in the harness.  While you do have to spread your knees out to peddle, it is not cumbersome and quickly became natural.  We both really enjoy her up front.  The balance on the bike has not changed much, though I can notice the added weight.  With the seat in place there is not enough room to easily stand up to gain leverage when going up a steep hill.  We mostly ride on bike trails, so this does not become an issue often.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The escapes were not horribly frustrating, and they were a lot of fun to play.  I wish there were more floors!
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Wanted did so badly I did the whole pre-order thing. Got it right when it was released. Love having it in my collection of French films!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved it. I read it on my flight to Fiji.<br /><br />My book club is doing it this month. would  highly recommend.
B0010T3UUM|5.0|When you stand on concrete all day, your feet and legs begin to ache way too much. These crocs have a nice cushion that makes being on your feet all day, bearable. There are several shoe styles, but unfortunately they don't make them in size 14 mens.
0345535421|5.0|Ordered this for my wife. While not my cup of tea, she loves it. An epic mid-evil soap opera. Wheee. I also have to say that I have not seen the HBO show either. She has and says it helps to read the books as well. (very true with ALL book adaptations).<br />So I guess per her, very highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book of the three that I read.  By this time one is acquainted to the characters and tends to know how the cat and mouse game is being played.  A person needs to read the first two books to understand the third.  Not written for prudes!
B00CWGLOY6|4.0|Saga.......so worth the read.  The characters, the plot, the graphics, well done.  Saga is about 2 people from warring planets, who are supposed to be enemies falling in love, getting married, and having a baby.  None of it should have been possible. Especially the baby, but now that she has been born , the parents are on the run because both sides wants them dead, and their baby alive.  I'm not sure why the planets are warring since it's been an ongoing war for as long as anyone can remember.  They don't even know.  The comic starts off with her giving birth and she feels like that she is crapping all over herself. Classic!  What a relationship between Hazel's parents.  Her mom, Alana and father, Marko, were both soldiers who have defected.  They are running to make a better life for their daughter.  They are so honest and open with one another that it was refreshing.  No games on either side.  They were tired of fighting. They are trying to get off of the planet where there wasn't anything but constant battles.  Marko and Alana encounter strife and obstacles throughout the whole series. There are some parts that make you raise your eyebrow:  The fully drawn sex scene between the prince and his princess. The whole planet of Sextillion, just pull out the first 3 letters of that word and use your most wildest imagination and that's what you get to see on some pages.  The other where you hope that the author doesn't delve too deeply is the child prostitution that happens on that planet. I'm telling you, this book has a little of everything.  Even the drawings of the killings don't get overlooked. Skulls being hacked or smashed off, icing on the cake.  What more can I say?  Great start to the series!  Can't wait to get my hands on the 2nd book.  :)<br /><br />Just as a point of clarification, there are 2 different POV's going on.  There is the actual story that is being told, then the block writing is told from Hazel's point of view as backstory.  It makes it easier tounderstand with tht tidbit of information.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Very good album.  I really like her sound. I highly recommend. When I buy am album I do not want all the songs to sound the same.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|As a neurologist, Dr. Permutter has cited many reviews of the effects on the brain.  He also includes his recommendations for tests, supplements, and many recipes for living the grain free life.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I received the product with great anticipation. However, all I get when I load the product is disc error #2. The movie does not start. I loaded it onto my computer, downloaded something, but it cannot be found on my computer. But, I guess I waited to long to get it straightened out.  WATCH FOR BAD OR BLANK COPY.  UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|it was an awesome book to read, love the plot, and love the character a lot. It was an awesome read.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|We wanted to buy these to use as &#34;thank you's&#34; when we did our road trip and were staying with friends and family.  They definitely were a hit, and we didn't have to spend an arm and a leg for a nice gift.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Not bad when you take into account that most zombie movies pretty much suck. Definitely would watch the sequel if made.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT. They shoot their way up a tower. The original Judge Dredd movie was much better. Watch something else.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Terrible movie with terrible acting . I was embarrassed just watching it. Let's hope there will be no more sequels Go Joe;(
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|An interesting subject that could have been put together in a much more readable fashion. I'll try it again sometime to see if I am more receptive
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Everything we loved from Buffy to Firefly. Witty and loveable &#34;real-people&#34; characters. We don't see Super Hero's but we know we are in a world where they exist. Just enough &#34;Future-Tech&#34; to make it Sci-fi yet it is the people, who make the show. All I need is a guest appearance by Jane.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I would recommend this book and series to anyone and everyone!!! It's a nail biter straight from the start. Hard to put down.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Just received this CD and popped it in the Bose. WHEW! Blown away! Hubby and I have been Amos Lee fans for several years now. This album is innovative and traditional at the same time-???. How? I can't explain it-you have to hear for yourself. Amos has vision and roots at the same time. I never, ever like any album on the first listen through...but I AM LOVIN' THIS ONE!!! Pure poetry mixed with that strong bluesy voice. Somewhere between southern rock and traditional blues music with lyrics that relate to the 'common man'. He put in a few pieces that seem 'fringe' for his typical style but I like the gritty edge that it provides on the CD.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|solid movie, entertaining but not over the top, good family film, something i can sit down and enjoy with my friends and family
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for everyone. It is but you'll get the hang of it after a while. When you get this game YOUR mind will be blown!
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I'll keep my review short. These girls are super talented! The music is so much fun to rock out to. They have a classic sound to them. It's a great debut album & I would also recommend checking out their live album from the iTunes Festival on iTunes! They are amazing live as well!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow, I absolutely loved this book. Not everyone is perfect, including Cecilia's husband, and it's refreshing when flawed characters are a major part of the storyline, just like in [[ASIN:B00E4VC70W Weak at the Knees]]which had me in floods of tears.  I like reading about 'real' characters and 'real' problems, beause that's what life can be like, complex and complicated. Bravo.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|This is a great way to have my photos on my Kindle Fire.  It works well and is just what I was looking for.
006224454X|3.0|This is a weird book.  I found myself wishing that the main character would hurry up and get her questions answered.  The ending was a nice surprise though.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This is a really great CD and is a very nice combination of songs put together for this album to enjoy.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Pretty cool digital feel. Not too bright in the dark. But sure about the weather application part, thinking you have to buy it. Still deciding if it is easy &quot;user friendly&quot; or not.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This program will turn anyone and any photo into a work of art. Easy to use and lots of fun.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Very fun and creative game. Me and my brother love this game! I rate it 5 stars for sure! So worth $3.00.

B004L0NGEC|2.0|Trying for days to get photos from Picasa to my Kindle Fire HD and nothing!! No hints on Amazon as to how to do this. All posts are old. This would be very helpful, if there were someway to have photos on the Kindle HD as well as in Picasa.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is great especially for visual people. it can be as easy or as difficult as you like. Games are saved even if in progress so you don't have to start over each time. Pictures are pretty and interesting.
1781162646|2.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King. I found this book disappointing. It was not interesting nor exciting, the dialogue between the kids was lacking. The ending was a fizzle.  If Stephen King's name was not on the book I would not have finished reading it; I kept expecting the old King to kick in but it did not. Already have purchased his new book, Doctor Sleep, and I am confident the old Stephen King will be found in its pages.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by this author! Read it for our book club this month! Why doin have to make this a certain amount of words? Annoying Amazon just sayin

B009YP9L7U|3.0|What girl says she doesn't want guys like this gets drunk, and marries on first meeting? This story just is not plausible. I even had to re-read it before reviewing, because it was not memorable enough to write a review. Boring.
0061537969|3.0|At first,,,,an interesting concept for a book,,,,,<br />from a dog's point of view.  But, after a while,,,,<br />it got somewhat annoying.  All of the race talk<br />as okay, but, again, kinda distracting.  Without<br />giving parts of the ending away,,,,,,,,THAT was<br />very, very realistic.  It was slightly better than okay.<br />,
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game to play download it use the pearls wisely and other stuff too I &lt;3 nemos reef but kinda pointless but fun
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|A fascinating study of what is possible. It gives hope to all sorts of people and their problem and possibilities.
1556438850|4.0|A lot of reading.  It was informative but a little long .  The book did go into information about the beginning of yoga.  I haven't finished it yet, so I can't give a complete review.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|&#34;FRINGE&#34; is like the recovering &#34;Handlyman in a junkyard&#34;. Buried deep in a university basement with a &#34;Restored Professor/Scientist &#34; tangling  the unimaginable. Unbelievable to the young detective, but so kin to the old scientist. JOAT
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Had to recharge my iPhone, kept running out of battery.<br /><br />All the video game and pop vulture references blended easily with a great story about a failed future. Great read.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|The imagination it takes for these stories is amazing. It is a good series that leads you deeper into the story with every page. Can't wait to start the next one
B00FPH6M82|4.0|The movie was good if somewhat predictable.<br /><br />I have a terrible time watching the movie.  I kept getting lost connection using my PS3 and my Sony TV.  Strangely I didn't get the problem with my PC.  This was on Friday night, I had to finish watching it on Saturday morning when there was only a single problem.  I want to blame ComCast but the Amazon application on the PS3 and Sony TV seem to have the real problem.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I finished this book in two days...I couldn't put it down.  A little dark at times, but the story was really engaging - I loved it.

B00847KFDS|5.0|A great job. Excellent CD. It's a great musician and has done a great job on this provider. Exelentes versions of great songs!.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Two fourteen-year old boys befriend a stranger (Matthew McConaughey) who has been living on their secret island in the Mississippi River.  His name is \\"Mud,\\" he's wanted for murder, and he's being followed by some very dangerous men.<br /><br />This movie is a real gem; it's smart, honest, and edge-of-your-seat exciting.  It portrays the boys' hardscrabble life in their backwater town with uncompromising violence and grit and is also filled with decency, understanding, and many forms of love.<br /><br />The two newcomers who play the boys are natural actors, both expressive and sympathetic.  McConaughey plays a tough guy who never had a break; he's an anti-hero to root for.  Reese Witherspoon has a small but important role as Mud's trampy girlfriend and Sam Shepherd and Joe Don Baker round out the excellent cast.<br /><br />All of the characters are well-developed and the audience comes to really care about them.  The story blends good bits from \\"Stand By Me,\\" \\"A Perfect World,\\" \\"Whistle Down the Wind,\\" and even \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and is still unique.  It pulls no punches and is truly enjoyable.  4.5 stars.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|A great job. Excellent CD. It's a great musician and has done a great job on this album. Exelentes and great songs!.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|I am a Shakespeare and Joss fan and iI loved this movie. They did a great job of adapting but maintained the intent of The Bard's words. Sean Maher was so great as a villain (loved when he reached for the cupcake!) and Nathan Fillion was (as usual) perfect and hilarious. Some reviewers did not like the black and white, but I didn't mind it and thought it added to the spell of this movie. Watch it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My grandson bought this game.  His favorite character is God whom he thinks is very cool.  I would have to agree.
0783226845|5.0|The title of this touching film has always managed to silently sneak into various conversations throughout my childhood and adulthood. If Al Pacino happened to be a topic of discussion, Scent of a Woman followed. If I saw a red ferrari driving down my street, my father alluded to the infamous racing scene in Scent of a Woman.<br /><br />When I stepped into my public library a few weeks I was lurking down the aisles without any intentions or expectations until I looked down. There it was, Scent of a Woman. I thought to myself, It is time.<br /><br />Charlie Simms played by (Chris O'Donnell) attends an elite prep school (Baird) in the far new England region. In order to pay for his flight back home to Oregon for the Christmas holiday he searches for temporary work during the Thanksgiving day weekend. It is here where Charlie finds temporary work to look after a retired Army Ranger Lieutenant Colonel, Frank Slade. (Al Pacino)<br /><br />When Charlie and another student, George Willis Jr (Philip Seymour Hoffman) unexpectedly become witnesses to a prank for the school's headmaster, Mr. Trask, Charlie is offered a bribe:<br /><br />Squeal on the pranksters and an open spot at Harvard awaits Charlie.<br /><br />Upon Charlie's visit to Frank's dwelling, Charlie discovers that he is a blind, short tempered and rambunctious alcoholic. After an intimidating and initial confrontation Charlie becomes hesitant to succumb to the task. However, he accepts the task after realizing how much the favor means to Frank's family. What starts out on a quite and serene landscape quickly evolves into a dramatic, touching and fun filled adventure. And in New York City no less, or according to Frank, the freak show capital of the world. The interaction between Charlie and Frank is nothing short of spectacular; Charlie, an innocent, genuine and warm-hearted young man learns how to cope and eventually embrace Frank's outgoing and sometimes inappropriate behavior. The friendship that ensues is one of deep respect and love.<br /><br />On the day of Charlie's judgment, which is in front of the entire school body including the headmaster and the disciplinary members we witness Charlie's good natured character stay intact. He cannot and will not break his code of principle that conforms to a special type of value, integrity. Frank Slade describes and explains the underlying reason for Charlie's actions in a beautiful and emotionally powerful speech that is memorable. In front of the entire school, Frank questions the type of men Baird School is breeding for leadership. He also explains the psychological and spiritual impact of the headmaster's decision. As quoted from Frank Slade, \\"there is no prosthesis for a broken spirit\\".<br /><br />The film evokes strong feelings of triumph, courage, and respect. Chris O'Donnell and Al Pacino are electrifying in every scene. The parts of New York City are filmed beautifully and contrast very nicely against the landscapes of Baird School. It is a solid film that will provoke thoughts about leadership.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very cute game plain and simple.  Just can't say enough about it.  My grandson has a hard time putting it down.

0385347774|4.0|This was an interestingly written book with a style I have never read before.  It's like reading the personal diaries of the two people involved.  Lots of unexpected plot twists that kept my interest up.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This what writing, drama and acting is all about! I can't wait for the next season and if you are prime member it is free!
B00DJ80VLS|1.0|The sound of the drums is so 80's sounding especially the snare; and this special edition lists it as W/ DVD (well, it's not a dvd) its a 5.1 audio only disc...very disappointed.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I grew up at a young age with Christopher Reeve and the John Williams theme. Reeve's performance is as classic and/or iconic as you can get in a different time period in its respected era. Now that we got that out of the way, after that debacle in 2006, 'Superman Returns', though classic is always a nice homage, I realized the Reeve's vision of Superman needed to be laid down and put to rest for good. Those classic elements just didn't seem to jive or connect with this modern world and the Superman character was stuck in quick-sand because of it. It was kind of sad to realize your favorite character of all time would forever be stuck in a time-warp and never would be takin' serious again.  Years leading up to Man of Steel, this Super-fan wanted more action. Wanted more edginess. Wanted a new direction that would force people to take Superman serious rather than a big cliche'. We got just that in Man of Steel. Not only does Man of Steel flesh out the origin of a New Krypton as we've never seen it before, but we see a brasher, more impulsive Superman told in a nonlinear way that breathes fresh, new life into a 75 year old character in serious need of an oil change. The mythology of Superman has been changed and though the older fans will forever cling on to their Superman of yesteryear, new and accepting fans alike have a chance to embrace Superman's comeback in  a way where it has only just begun. MAN OF STEEL. He's back and more powerful than a locomotive, baby!
B00E9P959O|3.0|Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some positives with this new remix, and I was very excited to get it.  The distortion and fuzz that was evident on most of the original tracks is gone, and I'll agree that the new sound is pretty clear and clean.  What saddened me, however, was that the raw power of Alex's guitar and traditional explosiveness of Neil's drum kit were seriously lacking.  As Rush fans, we are all accustomed to a beautiful and cohesive balance among the power trio's bass, guitar, and drums.  In this remix, I feel that balance is thrown off on numerous occasions.  On some of the tracks, Geddy's voice is pretty dominant, Alex's signature and expressive chord progressions were quite muted, and Neil was reduced to average sounding snares, subdued ride and crash cymbals, toms, as well as a very out of place and uncharacteristic clicky bass drum.  I can see how people would like this remix as it's been cleaned up a bit and enhanced, along with the emergence of some hidden melodies that were buried under the mastering disaster of 2002.  I personally, was more than fine with the instrument balance in the original record and was simply hoping for that same mix that exploded out of my stereo, minus the fuzz.  What we received was an entirely different project, softer and nicer, built completely from scratch.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I've heard about the show being a very good show. I purchased it because I was not up to date on it. It was available to me on<br />Video on Demand, however the censoring significantly diluted it. I wanted to watch it from its &#34;pilot&#34; as the show's producers intended it !<br /><br />it's a very good show and I am throughly enjoying it. I intend to purchase season two when done.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Happy to have this on my kindle but wish it linked with my Facebook game because I had to start at the beginning.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|they show just keeps getting better and better every year. I'm really glad I ordered the series as a whole.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It absolutely boggles my mind that some people (granted, not that many) have given this CD 1 and 2 stars.  To me, not liking their music is like not liking life. I would give it 10 stars if I could.<br /><br />I discovered The Piano Guys last year when I saw a video of them playing \\"Bring Him Home\\" from \\"Les Miz\\".  I immediately looked them up, started watching their videos and subscribing to their website.  I have been hooked every since.  I've downloaded pretty much all of their pieces and added them to the two CDs.  This is music I listen to on my iPod, on my computer, in the car--basically all the time.  It covers all emotions: I love it when I'm happy, it lifts me up when I'm a bit down, and it just makes me feel good. I'm listening to them even as I write this.<br /><br />I love the fact that they bring such emotion to their playing, and that they feel every note. You can see it in their faces and hear it in their music.  It's wonderful that the guys have made classical music so accessible, and have shown people, especially younger ones, that music can be fun.  That is very inspirational.<br /><br />I saw them in concert in  Anaheim,  California and was wondering how they would handle some of the pieces, given that there is so much visual \\"magic\\" in their videos. The concert was amazing--they played flawlessly, and cleverly interspersed the actual videos with the live playing.  It was wonderful that the packed house consisted of people of all ages--young kids, parents, and grandparents.  I have second row seats to see them in Seattle in February and cannot wait.<br /><br />Without sounding ridiculous, I have to say that these guys' music has added much to my life, and it is a true blessing that they are here. Buy their CDs, go see them in concert, support them on their website--they deserve it.  Music makes the world a better place, and the Piano Guys make music that is clever, inspirational, uplifting and just plain gorgeous.
B000002IJO|2.0|Crappy lyrics ! This sounds like my 6 year old son wrote the words and it was rushed to keep Ratts money wheel turning from invasion of your privacy's success ( Ratts best album by far) buy the first two Ratt releases and forget the rest! The people who gave this five stars must not have heard Ratts first two albums
B004SBX112|4.0|I really like this game. Great color and I like all the games but you don't get any helpers..Please add helpers to any updates.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Enjoy reading it but don't expect deep emotions like in some of his earlier work, most notable Atonement, the other with a female main character.<br />I liked the embedded stories, the probability game episode and the chance to learn something about the secret services role during the cold war.<br />The main characters did not quite convinced me, found hard to believe they were in love, didn't care much about them at the end.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|This particular film was doomsday dreary.  It was filmed under low lighting conditions.  In most scenes you could barely see the characters or locations.  Incredibly frustrating.<br /><br />I felt a sense of dread watching this film.  The villain's dark quest of Gotham mirrors much of today's world violence and the insatiable thirst of banks, corporations and legislators to inflict pain and suffering.<br /><br />There were three nice events in this film however,  1.)  Batman and Catwoman's use of the Bat Cycle (great stunts) and 2.) the Bat Craft that hovered above Matthew Modine's head when he thought he had the Batman cornered (loved it!) and 3.) the pairing up of the Batman and Catwoman at the end. (nice touch)<br /><br />I prefer the camp, 1966 \\"Pow\\" \\"Wham\\" \\"Zap\\" Batman starring Adam West and Burt Ward.  Lots of action, gadgets and zingers, \\"Holy Crap Batman!\\" without the violence.  Great music too.  Hopefully someday they'll release it on dvd.  The DC Comics animated kids version with Rino Romano is excellent too.<br /><br />On a lighter note, some of the Batman's great action moves make for excellent yoga poses.  I like to call it \\"Batman Yoga.\\"
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It simulates amazing weapons and also very awesome to make videos with it nothing else to just great just nothing.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|My husband and I both loved the book. Too much of it comes close to the truth of many marriages. Dorothea weaves a tale of married life.
B007ZH6WJY|4.0|I liked this book, it had excellent information, I thought it repeated some information. This would be a good read for anyone looking for answers about &#34;poverty&#34;.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|A fascinating cast of characters in a beautiful setting. Brings in the sights and history of Savannah that if you visit or live in Savannah you will recognize.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|The program really speeded up my Kindle Fire very quickly.  I would rate it 4 stars except I think it collects too much personal information.  But then most programs do that today anyway.

B000FBJAEG|5.0|This was a true, &#34;Can't put it down book.&#34; What a fun book. Very complicated plot and solution.  Can not wait to read the next next King and Maxwell.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George RR Martin is enormously talented.  Once I started reading his masterpiece series Song of Ice and Fire, I could not put them down.  I read his Fantasy novels at every opportunity.  I'm a few days away from finishing Dance with Dragons and it will excruciating having to wait on the final books.<br /><br />George needs to write a little faster.<br /><br />Can't wait for HBO to air Season 4 Game of Thrones which is now scheduled for Spring 2014.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I expected something a lot more polished, sophisticated and well written - I was disappointed. The writing is very poor, there is no plot, the sex scenes are boring and repetitive as are many of the things the characters do and say e.g. eye-rolling, lip biting, flushing etc, and the characters are totally unbelievable. As other reviewers have suggested it does seem to have been written by a teenager with little life experience and no writing skills.<br /><br />This is probably a bestseller simply because people got caught up in the hype and, like me, purchased the book to see what all the fuss was about. I'd be very interested to know more about the demographic that actually rates this book highly - would be pretty telling I think.<br /><br />&#34;In a class by itself&#34; says the Entertainment Weekly. It certainly is, and not one that good writers would aspire to, but no doubt it has made the author a lot of money. Suffice to say, I won't be reading the sequels.
141970642X|5.0|My grandson had read all the Wimpy Kid books. I was gald to beable to add this to his collection at such a reasonable price.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A complete ride.  Having had the shit scared out of me by reading The Shinning years ago, this is a perfect complement.  Not as scary, but a wonderfully told story.  Thank you Mr King
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I've read a number of the lean startup category books.<br /><br />In my opinion this one is the best.<br /><br />Why do I say that?<br /><br />Because when you read this book you will be able to implement virtually right away and get results right away.<br /><br />You won't be confused - you will be clear about the steps you need to take next.<br /><br />I recommend getting it if you're involved with startups in any shape or form and you're looking for clear direction.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Loved this series, now I own it.  I don't like how it was packaged, but for the cost, I guess it could have been worse.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|In ANY movie ought to make me go the other way. And I did after 20 minutes. Won't give the next one even that much time.
B006P0FIGU|5.0|Always a fan of The Three Musketeers, and it's always fun to see what kind of spin the next generation will put on it.  It was funny...and the air ships were hysterical.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I just bought it for the movies and found a small bonus inside with a little book with some pics of the models and making of the movie.

B000002KBU|5.0|When I was in high school, Joni was quite popular.  I really enjoyed her music, mostly from \\"Clouds\\" and \\"Song to a Seagull.\\"  I went to college as a music student in 1970 and stopped listening to much of the popular music I grew up with because I'd found classical and jazz, consumed by the complexities of music theory and the virtuoso musicians who played these \\"advanced\\" forms of music.<br /><br />So I missed \\"Blue,\\" and most of the subsequent albums Joni has made for the last 40 years....  My reintroduction to Joni actually began with Diana Krall's version of \\"A Case of You,\\" which is absolutely beautiful and poignant.  \\"Joni Mitchell wrote that?\\" was my initial response.  My wife and I began to explore Joni.<br /><br />I bought a bunch of her CDs on Amazon, then spent the hours I pass in my car listening to Joni.  The songs on \\"Blue\\" really jumped out at me:  California, A Case of You, Carey, etc.  Wow!  How could I have missed this for 40 years???  So melodic, so intimate--how could you fail to think you know this woman?<br /><br />IMHO, she's right up there at the top of the heap of songwriters of her generation.  \\"Blue\\" is the pinnacle of that particular phase of her musical life.  I am so glad to see young people getting it in some of these reviews.  It's hard to fathom that anybody could give \\"Blue\\" a serious listen and not fall in love with it.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is  ok I like the game slot menu people play this game and I am aficionados to this game a first I did not play it at all but now I love the game

B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app.  Is great. The weather channel right at your at  the touch of your customers hands.<br />I've been waiting  for an app like this that's simple and to the point.
B00CCKWUNG|5.0|Extraordinary exodus just looking for freedom.<br />One of my favourite films.<br />Christoph Waltz should work in all Tarantino's films, there's a terrific chemical.
B0051OZ564|5.0|I put off watching this movie for a long time due to bad reviews and feedback from friends, etc. Everybody said it was visually stunning, but that everything else was horrible.<br /><br />I didn't find that to be the case at all.<br /><br />While i suppose the multi-layered fantasy setting (there are at least 3) can be a bit confusing, I found the premise and the story to be fairly sound - considering it's mostly fantasy anyway. Maybe I'm not as hung up on reality as most people, but the \\"quest\\" scenes worked just fine for me. I could totally imagine something like that.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm sorry I waited so long to see this. If you're comfortable with fantasy and/or escapism I think it likely you'll like this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It really is my favorite game and I enjoy playing it very much.  It.s the game l play the most every day
B00DB97LRC|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it deserves it.  Good acting, good character development and good visuals.  Not cluttered with a lot of CGI.<br />I'd recommend it to anyone; especially Trekkies.
B00866H7SS|5.0|loved it!! amazing i normally dont read at all but i read this book ans the whole series within two weeks. it was amazing!!! if on sylvia would hurry up with the next books!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Use this at night to create white noise for a noisy household. Even though my preference is for the natural sounds, I like that it includes music and city noise too. The music sections are short and thus repetitive but that is why it is numbing /relaxing. I use it often. I used the focus brain waves too - not sure it wasn't just the expectation but did seem to complete more without jumping mentally between tasks.
0142405809|5.0|Read this book along with Room on the Broom to my granddaughter's class and the teacher was really impressed with the stories, the language and the children were really interested.  It's hard for me to get her interested in books not written by Julia Donaldson.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I am just reviewing to get the coins lol yeah it needs more words so just ignore this long message ok lol bye .. but the app is fun
0142407542|5.0|Was introduced to the books by my relatives in England and my granddaughter loves them.  The DVDs are such a perfect re-imaging of the book.  My granddaughter will get disinterested watching Disney movies and TV, and also PBS after about 30 minutes, But, if I put any of the Julia Donaldson book series on she will watch until the end.
B00EDR5N58|1.0|For the price I paid for this album I was expecting to receive real playable vinyl records. These are not real vinyl records, but simply decorative junk.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|good game but you have to rate it to ensure that they dont erase your progress.  really addictive and fun to play.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great to play whether you spend money or not. Graphics are great and there's an actual plot and goals to the puzzles.
B00ER23V1W|2.0|I can only think that many of the reviews are by people connected to the production. This score is not very special at all, very middle of the road and almost tedious. The violin use is typical and cliche' and the melodies are simplistic and tiring.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Not much to say here! Love TBBT and I think I always will! Can't wait to see what happens with penny and Leonard!
B00DBISUWS|5.0|if you are a fan, it is a whole experience like the other albums.  If you are new to the Frapp, this is dreamy, emotional, deep music.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the most impressive game I have EVER played in my whole entire life!!!! You did an amazing job glu!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Not worth the pixels that illuminate it.  I can't believe after decades of experience and billions of dollars, this is the kind of movie we get from our 'A-listers'.  This is a culture in decline.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like many others, I didn't know what twists and turns Wool had in store for me. But I loved every one and feared the jutting angular sharpness of the unseen stairwells ahead.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book. Way better than Twilight! Very well thought out and written. Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is just simply....BEAUTIFUL!! Lol I'm like addicted or some thin, can't stop playing it. Guess what I reached level 27 in a day!
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|I got this app on &quot;Free app of the day&quot; I wouldn't buy it. You can't do much. Might as well get the free one. Maybe add some more stuff to it. People going to pay for it. Just stick with Instagram and it's free. Look in the bright side, it works.
B004EAFQG0|4.0|In the world today everyone should be aware of what other do on the internet, a great film for staying aware, and checking the facts.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The plot has enough interesting aspects to it, with very strong visuals too, so that it is entertaining (and somewhat though-provoking).
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Wow what an eye opener about the life in the south. It was funny and sad also. I really enjoyed watching the Movie.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This is a good game for all ages. It's cute and addictive. it's about timing - once you press the button and knowing when to let go of the button so that granny can land on her feet or get her cane to hook onto the next bar or wire so she can still pass or get further ahead of the thief. IMO it's most important to get helmets for granny so she recovers from a bad landing faster. You're trying to get as many coins as possible along the way and also land high points for a great landing after she jumps. As long as you finish one scene you can move onto the next one. Right now I'm stuck on &#34;Underground&#34;. Hopefully, I can get through this one soon.

B00FPGSPQU|1.0|If I could give it 0 Stars I would. Terrible. Unbelievable comedy. Stupid. I can't believe I paid for this trash!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Wow...I could not stop reading . The way everything is explained is so in depth and easy to understand. I  look forward to implementing all the knowledge I have leaned from this outstanding book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Can be a little difficult to navigate.  Upgrade costs are not always clear.<br />fun to play but not really worth spending money for coins and such.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well written and good actors. I enjoy seeing Julianna Margulies back on TV, she was so great on ER. Looking forward to watching all 5 seasons of this show.
B00ECLU346|1.0|The movie had a couple scenes that offered a few laughs, but it was rather serious and boring. The clip during the credits was hilarious and reminiscent of the first and second hangovers, so I would hope they'd build off that clip and make a fourth one (if they were planning on doing another). This movie lacks any of the spontaneity and chemistry that the first two installments had. I easily sat through it because I like the characters, but as you watch it you no doubt will think to yourself how this movie just falls flat. If you're looking for a comedy that delivers insane laughter it isn't this movie. Oh, and I wouldn't say it gives \\"closure\\" or anything like that. It's just another sequel that leaves the door open for more films.
B0036T52NM|5.0|Excellent, unique movie.  Really cool idea that's unlike anything I've seen in this genre.  Watch this movie.  Mind bender to the max.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not put it down. My husband and I were on a long road trip and it helped the hours and miles to fly by. My heart ached for th
B000VDUWMC|5.0|It's all been said, better than I could say it. Although I do appreciate what you do. Except for the requirements!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I am formatting a book for a friend and we needed to find out some of the details on how to prepare it. This book &#34;filled in the gaps&#34;.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I love this version of the classic. It is very contemporary while staying true to the verse. The actors are all perfect in their roles. All the commentaries are a great plus!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Keyboard size is perfect. Keeping a history helps with checking long columns of figures. Couldn't be happier with my choice
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fantastic. it definitely helps with your ability to react quickly. this game is like those other run games, but with much better graphics and cooler perks. I highly recommend this app!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It will be good if it can cast local videos too , Youtube can cast on its own without chrome<br />cast
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Not as good as Rome or GOT, but well worth watching.  It takes a little too long to divorce Catherine and get on with Anne. I can't imagine how this went on for 7 years.
B003VANOFY|3.0|These are by far my favorite headphones but the current Logitech software didnt work well with my computer, a common thing for Logitech and I. If you dont have any other logitechs you're probably safe, I currently use a mouse aswel, and when the two tried to use the same program, my headset always lost.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Fsntastic. Great movie. I never ser this movie. This movie ha Great for a class. Mt zona vida this movie for a class.
3438052199|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is studying Biblical Hebrew. It seems really awesome and is just what he needed for his class.  (Okay, it was the required textbook... but I love the Bible!)
B00FN8FCO8|5.0|And with him is Korn's signature sound. This album is so much better than their last two and is somewhat akin to &#34;See You on the Other Side.&#34;<br />It starts of hard and fast with their best new song &#34;Prey for Me&#34; but continues to deliver with songs like &#34;Mass Hysteria&#34; and &#34;Punishment Time.&#34;<br />Bottom line, this one is a must buy for all Korn fans.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Amazing deal. This collection has like over 20 books in it thats less than a nickle a book. excellent deal.Excellent quality
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I didn't think he could handle these kind of music, but he excelled!  He has so much gift therefore so much to give.
B00ET2ODTE|1.0|I would like to give this movie a 1.5, but since there's no option, I have to give it a 1. This movie was entertaining, but way too preachy. This is the story of Linda Boreman, a young girl who made terrible choices and then spent the rest of her life trying to blame everybody else for those choices.<br /><br />Pros: I will give credit where it's due and say that I appreciated that they did show some nudity. I think it would have been unfitting to have a too-sanitized movie about the most famous porno ever. I will also say that Hank Azaria did a great job as the director of Deep Throat.<br /><br />The Actors: Amanda Seyfried does a good job pulling off the naive girl, but is very one-dimensional. She has the same look of bewilderment and surprise throughout the entire film. Peter Sarsgaard was the best thing about this movie; he gave off a charismatic vibe that was done very well. Though I think James Franco is often very good, he was entirely wrong for the part of Hugh Hefner. He didn't walk or talk like Hef; he was just James Franco in leisure wear. I literally thought, \\"Is that supposed to be Hugh Hefner?\\" His part in the movie made no sense and was completely irrelevant as well.<br /><br />The Writing: The story jumped around chronologically and the plot skipped over YEARS and YEARS of story that painted Linda as just a poor girl who did a porno one time and that has haunted her forever. WRONG. She did several more pornos after Deep Throat and even did Deep Throat II. However, the film shows her taking a principled stand against doing more pornography and she even states that her career in porn was only 17-days long. It was several years long. Omitting facts for the sake of storytelling is fine, but the writing was as such as to make us feel sympathy for this poor girl, when it was A) her choice, and B) a career that lasted for several years.<br /><br />The Truth: I would be remissed if I did not write about my frustrations over the \\"spin\\" and \\"liberties\\" this film took. Linda Boreman very well MAY have been pressured to do porn. But at the end of the day, it was her choice and she did it. The film worked very hard to convey a \\"nothing is her fault\\" viewpoint, but honestly, the most truthful part of the movie was when Linda's mother, ably played by Sharon Stone, told her that she was a big enough girl to get married, thus she was a big enough girl to handle the consequences on her own. We are supposed to feel that her mother was unkind and cold, but I found her to be the only dealer of harsh truths.<br /><br />The movie missed out on so much by glossing over the last 30 years of Linda's life, but perhaps that's for the best. Linda Boreman (Lovelace) was an opportunist. She was an opportunist when she was doing porn; she was an opportunist when she figured out she could make money with her clothes on. By joining the \\"anti-pornography\\" crusade, she may have even deluded herself into believing that she was a victim. The woman had sex on film with dogs; she was not a victim, she just discovered a convenient way to shift the shame onto others.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|The best of the selection is the one that became an everyday radio request - When I was your man.  There are so much introspection in most of the songs in this cd and the beat is addictive.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|If you likes how many hits were on the &#34;Believe&#34; cd, Cher has done it again with<br />numerous songs that will definitely make their way up the charts as they begin<br />to release them. I definitely recommend this cd!!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Although this was historical fiction it gave me a glimpse into a culture I know nothing about. I can imagine the situations Mr Johnson writes about are much worse than he describes. The book really affected me, kept me awake some nights. My question... how can &#34;civilized&#34; folks be so inhuman?<br />A must read for all...
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|No doubt this is the best movie of the year. It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a well thought out plot. We really liked it and do recommend it to adults as it gets pretty dark.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Bought it for myself and my grandkids and also as a XMAS gift.  Its a great feel good movie and the kids live it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This form of solitaire is both challenging and straight forward.  I'm glad it comes with instructions and an easy win choice.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|I watched twenty minutes of this movie hoping the entire time it would get better. At twenty-five minutes I shut it off and started wishing I hadn't wasted my money. This is no Sean Penn thriller. It is an artsy-fartsy film and, although I'm not adverse to watching these types of films, I just wasn't in the mood. I really wanted a movie similar to Mystic River, which is how the ad for the movie played. Don't be fooled! The only reason it gets two stars is because Sean Penn is in it.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I had just read the life of Victoria and I really enjoyed the movie, but I do wish it could have included more of her reign as queen. I also liked the movie Mrs. Brown in which she came out of mourning after prince Albert's death.  Carolyn
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|Solid album. I have never enjoyed listening to Korn until I heard Never Never on this album then I bought it and I have enjoyed every song.
B00867HDTA|4.0|Love this game and have been playing it off and on for almost a year. Great when it comes to<br />killing time on the fly. They do need to add some more content. Maybe even a multi-player type situation. Regardless... Worth the money.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I use this keyboard on my Motorola Optimus L9. I originally started looking for a new keyboard app because of an annoying glitch in the stock keyboard, but now that I am used to Swiftkey, I know it would be worth the money regardless.<br /><br />The swipe recognition is amazing. Even for long or unusual words, the keyboard usually knows what you want to type. The predictive text is also pretty good, but I don't use it often since swiping is fast enough for me.<br /><br />Also, this keyboard claims to learn from you. It will track where your fingers are on the screen when you are trying to hit certain letters. I didn't see much \\"learning,\\" but since it was so good right from the start, I don't think it could have improved much anyway.<br /><br />You will not regret purchasing this keyboard.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter but after watching her play it I took it over. it teaches a lot about caring for horses.
0399208534|5.0|Love  this book, have for always.......gave board book to my granddaughter at an early age.....she just celebrated her 2nd birthday and i bought this one for her.
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|The music is perfect for the picture, but better yet, is very enjoyable listening.  Great instrumental rock, and the CD includes almost all of the great 70's vocals.  Herr Zimmer has been a busy fellow this year.  This is a great job!
0887081770|4.0|Love this book but bought it for a friend's child, thinking it was larger......my fault, I did not check size.......it worked for a book for my granddaughter's travel bag....she has teh bigger book and loves it.....I went to B&K and got the bigger book for my friend.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|We loved Andy Whitfield, but Liam McIntyre stepped into impossible to fill sandals and did fill them.  He needs to be in major Hollywood films.  This series was perfectly done, continuing the same big budget feel and the captivating characters, keeping nicely with history and story telling.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|More than anything, I’m captivated by an author’s voice, the storytelling. I want to feel the story in my gut; I want to revel in the imagery. Gaiman’s prose in “The Ocean at the End of the Lane” captivated me from page 1 and wouldn’t let go. I was immersed in the narration. A book like this is the reason I read fantasy in the first place. I’ve added this book, along side Neverwhere and The Graveyard Book, to my list of favorites. HIGHLY recommended.
B003PIUC02|5.0|We will miss Andy Whitfield.  He created a captivating, mesmerizing character.  The series' production values are excellent, the history pretty accurate, and all the actors wonderful.
B00705GEO4|5.0|Sabaton has great vocal melody and imaginative, original sound. The vocals are strong and powerful with guitars and keyboard that leave the listener feeling overwhelmed.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Doesn't get any better than this.  Looks like a major motion picture.  Acting top notch from all characters.  Keeps with history but keeps you hoping.  Liam McIntyre is beyond wonderful.  His Spartacus is a noble king who we could use right now.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|When I got the Cromecast, it worked fine with my galaxy tablet, but it did some update and stopped working.  It still works on my laptop but has limited usage.  I hope that the community steps up and gets it works a lot better.
B0041L0Z1S|5.0|Does anyone know where I can get the FULL version of this mini-series?  The one here is missing parts, for example, there is a scene where Mr. Knightly is walking with Mrs. Weston and expressing his concerns about the friendship with Harriet Smith.  He talks about how it will play to Emma's vanity but Mrs. Weston sees no harm at all.  That's just one of several missing segments.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was wonderful to get in touch with Danny again. I guess it didn't surprise me that he was an alcoholic... Genes and life started him in that direction. But only Danny could do the rest. Thanks for bringing back such a great old friend!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun game to play with all its different things you can do they did a good job with this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of our favorite games to play on tablets. You can win so many prizes in the Mystery Boxes. And try not to hit the train.... if you do the cop will Chase you. RUN! And open different people to escape with. Play this game if you are interested. :)

B004KSQN7C|1.0|Let's get one thing straight: I've been a devoted fan of Britney's since \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" dominated the airwaves.    So it kills me to say that I can't stand any of the songs on \\"Femme Fatale.\\" I mean, where's the heart? Where's the soul? Where's the magic? Britney's music just hasn't been the same since she shaved her head, as sad as it sounds. The whole situation depresses me. I really can't believe people are saying this album is her best yet. Really, people? You think this overly electronic-sounding s*** is better than \\"Oops,\\" \\"Lucky,\\" \\"Sometimes,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,\\" \\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\\" \\"Toxic,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" \\"Anticipating,\\" \\"Lonely,\\" \\"That's Where You Take Me,\\" \\"Boys,\\" \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy,\\" or even \\"Dear Diary\\"?! If so, think again.    Oh, and the kicker: Britney can't dance anymore.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is awesome<br /> And it  was free I am just happy  my girlfriends love it too
B009LDCXNY|4.0|Received the dvds the next day in great condition. The only thing is the box and the menu set up is different from the rest but still good :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a difficult game which makes it interesting. I love it! It takes a lot of skill.those pigs are very tricky to get.
0061950726|4.0|Found this fascinating.  Didn't know anything about the trains which took children out to the Midwest.  Showed me that we haven't made too much progress in the way we treat foster children, although the laws are enforced now.  Interesting view from both sides, now and then. A piece of our history that I wasn't aware of.  Well written
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|such a journey of hope and perserverence, showing  that our search for truth often using distraction and distance, gives us our wellbeing
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything I need it to do. Installed and was using it in less than two minutes. Would definitely recommend.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Living in a rural area I find TV Weather reports only give me a general idea of what to expect. AccuWeather gives me a much more specfic & timely report.
B00138H4CK|5.0|I stumbled on this because I was looking for a rendition of My Back Pages. This album is a real treat full of unforgettable performances of Dylan's songs by other artists as well as Dylan. Stevie Wonder does an amazing rendition of Blowing in the Wind. Shawn Colvin rocks You Ain't Going Nowhere. And Tom Petty makes my least favorite song, Rainy Day Women, my favorite. Just to mention a few.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Excellent series hope another season will come. I am looking forward for a sixth season. It is a very interesting and relaxing series.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I had to watch it twice to understand it.  Very good CGI.  Difficult to contemplate the absolute post-apocalyptic deprivation in the face of superior alien technology, including the ability to clone people.  Although some may feel the ending was hopeful, I found it depressing.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Another great read by Brandon Sanderson. I've had to many late nights reading this book as it was hard to put down, just one more chapter I'd tell my self. Can't wait to read the next!
B000L53D4O|3.0|I bought this for my daughter at 6 months, she loves it, but not to learn to walk, it is too light, so when she tries to stand, she falls and pulls it down on her, also, she likes the front better with the toys, so it kind of defeats the purpose to try to train her to walk, she is 11 months now and still is not using it to help her walk, she just plays with the front toys
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I could not put it down! Some of the story was a little predictable but the end was a twist I didn't see coming. It leaves the reader wanting a little more wrap up of loose ends.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|OK.  I've just about had it with Big Fish Casino and the Blackjack game.  Several times I have either won, or bought chips for this game, and when I collect more than a million dollars in chips, and log off, I come back to less than 100 grand in chips!! Then, there's no one to call, or complain to, to get my money back! I'm SO DONE with this game.  The government rips us off enough.  I don't need it from a stupid, online game too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the  movie first and not surprisingly found it a lot more detailed character-wise etc than the movie. Nice book.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book! Could not put it down! Can't wait to read the next. Good book for kids and adults. Highly recommend
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The author should have stopped at the second book. Not a good ending to. Great series and a very sorrowfully , poor ending.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Simply put, it's a beautiful thing. All the fun of one of my favorite board games that I can play anywhere, any time? Fantastic.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Great Australian Aboriginal tidbits and a tour of select parts of the continent. As a story built around an exotic land it forgot to be worth the book buildup with people I couldn't believe and scenes out of clouded mind. Obviously the author was enamored with &#34;Shark Week.&#34;
B00EPMFZJK|5.0|It is a classic and fully justified.  It is a masterpiece for sure.  An easy read that everybody should pick up!
B0032CVAQQ|2.0|This book seems to find ways to make excuses for peoples actions rather than what the title proposes will be in the book. Read from cover to cover I was very disappointed.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've read many books on accounts of war time stories, and as a middle aged man that did not serve, I found myself immersed and in awe of the way Adam Brown overcame the hurdles in his life.  I finished the book in sadness..in fact it brought tears to my eyes and I was surprised as to why this book affected me this way.  I've never been affected emotionally just by reading a book....I remember thinking, &#34;I'd like to look up his wife and tell her how much I appreciate his ultimate sacrifice as much as her patience with him as he found his way through life&#34;, but I'm sure she's heard it so many times that yet another person saying that would be just &#34;another reminder&#34;.  I don't rate books, but this one moved me.  I found it to be more than worthwhile, though not a typical book on blood and guts, as much as it was about the &#34;GUTS&#34; of Adam Brown and how he lived his life courageously and selflessly after overcoming addiction and serving his country and his brothers in arms
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|This movie provides a truly accurate depiction of the strife that the Vietnam War  brought to American and foreign troops during the height of that war. It very accurately shows the horrendous conditions that we put our soldiers in during a time when Vietnam was building.  If you are a vet you will relate to this movie and the horrors of war. Well worth the two hours and eighteen minutes of run time.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I ordered the book \\"The Husband's Secret\\" on October 13, 2013.  It was never received on my Kindle.  It is however, being charged to my Amazon account($5.99).  Where is my e-book???
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I see people claim it's too short. I would like more but for t h e price, it was awesome.  Can't wait for The Room Two.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love this show! We watch the DVDs<br />Over and over again! We have been fans since season one and is still hilarious!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I started this series from the &#34;beginning,&#34; having been told by a friend about Drizzt.  It blew me away.  I can't get enough of the stories.  The characters' love for and loyalty to each other despite all their differences is outstanding.  More more more!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love castle and I love Beckett and I really love me some caskett! This show is great! And Nathan is just too cute for words! I hope to see more of the lighter side of them soon. I really enjoyed the birthday episode and I did catch that castle's birthday is on April fools day! Nice one guys!
1607066017|5.0|Love the art. Love the story. It's hard to portray a vast universe in 6 issues, but Vaughan does exactly that, makes it hilarious and exciting all the same. I knew from the first page I would love it. Hilariously irreverent & original I expect to revisit it over the years. Hard not to devour in one sitting, I just ordered vol 2.
0385342071|5.0|I loved this quick and easy summer read from Sophie Kinsella. Yes, this author's books may be formulaic and predictable, but they can't be beat for making me chuckle at her heroine's ridiculous antics and for keeping me entertained! I would recommend this if you have enjoyed any of Kinsella's other novels.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|This was a great read until the last few chapters and then this book almost felt like the author gave up and just did a unthought sappy ending. Will never recommend
0062255657|5.0|A beautifully-written, well-crafted story with so many complex elements to it. Yet again, Neil Gaiman has proven to me that he is a master of fantasy, suspense, and of walking the line between magic and reality. I read this book in one sitting on a long flight over the summer, and I'm so glad I did. I fell in love with this short, dark, memorable fantasy.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Season two of Downtown Abbey is only exceeded by Season 3 in its awesomeness. Even if you aren't a fan of period drama (I am with you) you will find yourself sucked into WW1 England in no time. Outstanding.
B000002JEV|5.0|bought this cd in Iceland when it came out in Europe years ago.  Lost one of the disc's.  First set was gifted, unexpectedly. so lets see how long I keep this set.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I've ever recommended a book to as many people as I have with this one. It is an incredibly creative story full of great characters contained within a claustrophobic world that is so easy to imagine. This book caused me to buy every thing else Mr Howey has written and they are all good (but Wool is the best). You won't regret it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I wanted something to replace having to always use my phone as an alarm clock when I'm not at home. This is the perfect app for me.<br /><br />Update...the alarm is quiet, so if you're one that sleeps through the alarm this isn't the app for you.<br /><br />I still love it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|The only irritating thing about this book is that it has an end. It is an outstanding fantasy novel without the usual hundreds of characters and irritating complexity. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This a kind of a hard review to write, I own a Roku HD which has rarely been touched. I wanted a internet media device which I have for the past 6 months been relying on my Wii U to preform. I like being able to watch Twitch videos, youtube, Hulu plus and Netflix videos on my tv. The Wii U has been my go to device here recently however the 35 dollar chrome cast has been a interesting replacement. For Netflix and Hulu integration, this device works great. It has no menu of its own so you must connect with it from another device. I use a Nexus 4 and a iPad for this and it works nicely, the quickest start up out of any device I have used so far. If that is important to you great but I am somewhat used to the 20 sec load up time where the quicker start up is nice but not really something I was looking for. The youtube integration is the best selling point so far, and in my world this has been a life saver. The Wii U has made youtube videos watchable but there has always been a few hangups. If you want to watch a live youtube broadcast you must share your tab on full screen as the device will not stream it. Not a big deal as I just hide the tab behind my browser. Twitch support would be the best point I wish to bring up. If you watch Twitch videos I love source media, its quicker and not converted as its other formats and the Wii U and every other device outside of my computer would not have this as a option. I need to do the same thing as a Youtube live stream when trying to watch a Twitch stream but it is so nice to watch this on my TV.<br />I have yet to find a reason to stream a webpage but it is available. If I felt like watching a flash animation from Newgrounds this would be the only real reason but if you wish to stream a webpage then here you go.<br /><br />The options available to change are limited which I guess is a good thing however there are times where I would like to change the way the video is displayed. Sometimes it looks like my TV clips the corners only so slightly but it may be my angle. You can change the video quality and the devices name and if you wish, you can even factory reset the device.<br /><br />For what this device does it works for my needs and replaces my need for the Wii U which saves a few headaches in changing settings to get the best picture for my live streams. The price makes this very attractive to me and my Roku device is now in another room as I try and figure out what to do with it.<br /><br />My only issue that I can think of that might cause some one to have a negative view would be stream lag, if you stream a twitch video for example the tv and computer will have a 1 sec delay, I just put the tab behind another tab to ignore that but some may find the non real time view annoying, I honestly don't but to each there own. I would buy this again and if I ever figure out a reason for a 2nd one I will swipe one up.nly so slightly but it may be my angle. You can change the video quality and the devices name and if you wish, you can even factory reset the device.<br /><br />For what this device does it works for my needs and replaces my need for the Wii U which saves a few headaches in changing settings to get the best picture for my live streams. The price makes this very attractive to me and my Roku device is now in another room as I try and figure out what to do with it.<br /><br />My only issue that I can think of that might cause some one to have a negative view would be stream lag, if you stream a twitch video for example the tv and computer will have a 1 sec delay, I just put the tab behind another tab to ignore that but some may find the non real time view annoying, I honestly don't but to each there own. I would buy this again and if I ever figure out a reason for a 2nd one I will swipe one up.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|There is nothing not to like about Downton Abbey UNLESS you hate outstanding acting, great writing, beautiful sets and plotlines that will likely cause you to watch the whole series in a weekend. Season three is the best one yet.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Elvis' versatility as a singer is on full display here in this collection.  He does rock, pop, soul, gospel, and country with great authority and conviction.  Some of the songs are very touching, as they reflect events that were occurring in Elvis' personal life.  Casual listeners might not enjoy this music, but the real Elvis fans will love it.  As a vocalist, these are Elvis' best recordings.  Also included is a booklet containing rare photographs from that era (early 1970's) and a very good written account of these recording sessions.  Long live the king!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Better than season one, so many twists and turns that are incredible.  It grabs you from the very first episode!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It's hard to discount someone else's telling of such an experience but then difficult to understand some of the medical reasoning for it.  It does give one some things to think about.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|To say the least I tried every experiment except the one with the wires, I will do it soon (but I don't own wire hangers). Everything worked for me like a charm, but I will also have to admit that I have been building this up for some time. And for those of you who understand how to manifest, the hardest part is not manifesting but getting out of your own head (b.s. programming that we have all carried for years).<br /><br />This book provides a guide on how to be more engaged in your manifestation. How to build up your confidence and belief in what you are capable of. Manifesting is something we already do, whether we are in; auto pilot (with all of our predisposed beliefs) and just letting random situations and opportunities happen or in manual mode where you can bring into your observation the opportunities and situations that you want to achieve what you want.<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone, because predisposed beliefs systems do not let you see what it is you are doing. It is great for people who are at the right place in their personal development.
1572814136|5.0|I love the bright colors and the back of the deck is a lot better looking to me than the standard Rider-Waite deck.  Didn't really have a problem with a smell.  It did smell a little strong when I first opened the box but I keep them in a wooden box now and have no issues with smell or them sticking together.  Nice deck.
B00DJYKFXG|4.0|THE MUSIC IS GREAT OF COURSE.THE &#34;DVD&#34; HOWEVER IS JUST A 5.1 SURROUND SOUND WITH STILL PHOTOS!!THE 2 VIDEOS ARE JUST OKAY.TERRIFIC HISTOTICAL RECORD IS TEMPERED BY WHAT ROBBIE DOESN'T TELL US ABOUT THE DVD.A BIT MISLEADING I FEEL.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I could go on and on and on about why I love this movie and argue why it is so spectacular, but I hope it suffices to say that this movie is just everything I wanted in a Superman movie. From the solid performances from Cavill's wonderfully heroic Superman and Shannon's menacing yet sympathetic Zod, to the wonderfully directing and writing that hold the movie together. The only complaints I have are that the pacing is a bit off, the shaky cam can get a little annoying (especially since I'm used to Snyder's slowmo), and there is an unnecessary action scene when Superman is fighting the world engine's tentacles. This aside, this is an amazing origin story and lays good groundwork for the tone and setting of future Justice League movies.
B00FKE3H0G|5.0|There are only a few songs I am not into. The rest is great, lots of meaning in her songs
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|I've been hearing WOTE music online for months now and decided to buy this CD - I love it! Have listened to it twice in the first day.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|addicting game that is worth being downloaded. great graphics and the action is awesome.nonce you.play it you will see. the weapons and accessories make it a game you want to master and play tip the end of the story.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun to play and not overly challenging. Very easy to catch on to. I wish there were more gun options though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Some of my friends have made fun of  the large display but I get the last laugh when I see them squinting and reaching for their reading glasses or struggling not to press several buttons at once on their tiny cell phone key boards.
B008IG5BHK|5.0|I have a 2 and 4 year old they loved the movie.  If you liked the first movie then you will like the 2nd one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was such a moving book.  The premise is interesting with death telling the story.  It was an easy read because the sections were short and he kept giving you sneak peaks at future events.  Be prepared to boo hoo at the end but to be very satisfied.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the only game I can beat my freinds at. Im good at lots of other games but I'm the best at this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I would like this book very much.  The situations could have happened in everyday life, just happy it was not mine.  You never knew what direction each would take and kept you interested from page to page.
074356619X|5.0|I lost my copy of this book. I like to listen to it periodically... it is a great reminder to stay focused and positive.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I think it may be difficult to use if you have no previous knowledge of French but it really helps improve existing skills and adds new words and expressions. My one problem with it is in the spoken phrases, perhaps it is the kindle fire HD limitations but I have difficulty hearing the phrases properly. Overall though it is well worth persevering with. Perhaps I will understand the spoken phrases better as I get used to it.
B008M721MS|5.0|This is something that I have been looking for since I purchased my Kindle. It works just like the PC version and has much the same interface.  Now you can take it anywhere and still stay in contact with family and friends...
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Saw Jaycee on TV show and had to buy her book!  Wonderful book, just sooo sad she had to write it. My 12 yr old wants to walk 1.5 miles home. I say, Hell no! I will move Heaven and Earth to make sure sure she doesn't walk home.
B001QI0FAA|1.0|If you love the old artsy B movies from decades ago this is for you. Don't expect any special effects. Extream low budget.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is the best book ever because it talks about a wimpy kid named Greg Heffley  trying to be cool
0547391005|5.0|I grew up on Curious George and the real H A Ray writings and drawings! Who wouldn't love Curious George!
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better!  I wish I had started following this years ago, now I'm playing catch up. Love the story lines and the actors.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I highly recommend this show...the story line draws you in as you get to know the family. I have re-watched all three seasons...looking forward to season 4.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Excellent show!  I can't stop watching. Very well written with great actors. I only wish I had started watching it years ago.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As with seasons 1 & 2 this is the best show...I have re-watched the first three seasons getting prepared for season 4...I have to say that I was sorry to see Matthew go...I loved Matthew and Mary as a couple. You really feel like you know the whole family. Highly recommend.
B0058SNJCA|5.0|These shoes are so cute and comfortable!  Even cuter than the picture.  Exceeded all my expectations based on the other positive reviews. I found fit true to size.  Ordered a 7 and I usually wear 7-1/2.  Found these to be extremely comfortable and versatile after having foot surgery 5 months ago.  I will look at Crocs first when buying more shoes. They feel natural on my feet, better than going barefoot.  Can't rave enough about how great they are for me and think you would love them too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome it is relaxing and enjoyable wish they would get more to breed have them all so far. Addicted to this game.
1607066017|4.0|When I heard about this story, I was excited to get into a new, innovative series. I'll buy these, then my teenage kids will pick it up and we'll enjoy them together. Not this one! It seems unnecessarily vulgar. Gratuitous sex is just plunked in there, for shock value I guess. It is kind of like watching Walking Dead and enjoying the story, and all of a sudden they feel like adding a head getting chopped off. Too bad, because the story and art are some of the best I've seen in a long time.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|i really want this app. so i've tried to download it at least 7 times.  i still haven't been able to get it to work.  &#34;it's a bad song Petey.&#34; unless they can fix this problem, this app is less then worthless, which is a shame.  because it could be amazing.
B00AA03D18|5.0|If this doesn't make you know that there is a God and a Heaven, then you must be dead.  Wonderful book and written so clear.  Everyone should read it at least twice.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I've tried it with an iPod, iPad and iPhone and it works great. A nice product to have since Apple charges obscene prices to upgrade the storage on iDevices at point of purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I played this game on another device first and liked it so I got it on my kindle. Once I started playing I just couldn't stop. One thing that I don't like is that you have buy more tokens to get more minions, all but the first three.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I had this game on my iPad for quite a while back and then it stopped working and now I am so happy that I have it on my kindle fire! I don't understand why people are complaining, this is a LONG TERM game that you play for a little while and then you put it down and continue with your LIFE and then when you are bored you come back and play some more and \\"gasp\\" your energy had been restored! I usually have no problems getting the materials I need from friends that you just add with a click and they really help A LOT!! If you have no life and you want to sit there and finish this game in a day then yes you are gonna spend money but if you do have a life and you want a time pleaser that you can enjoy and then put down once you get you little \\"me time\\" then this is perfect for you!!!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|My granddaughter told me about this game, so I got it and started playing. It's not as easy as you may think, I,m only on the third level and I have had this game for about two weeks.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Well considering its like a lot of other car games, with its usual tricks and interesting gameplay, I enjoy it. It's soundtrack is pleasing so yeah. 5.5 papayas out of six.
B008LXZEYU|4.0|anchorman the legend of ron burgundy is funny.  can not wait until anchorman part two comes out later this month.  stay classy
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This bingo game used to be fun and entertaining but now some items needed to complete rooms have been made ungiftable and they are impossible to win. It's so frustrating that I am definitely stopping playing this game.
B0051CSI0G|5.0|I love the hell out of this movie. It starts off kind of cheesy, but as the film go's on the chees fades away into something great. It has some great characters, great acting, great special effects and all in all a great film! I know I'm saying great a lot but that's all I can say about this film, its just a really well made film. The best part... no god damn sparkly vampires!<br /><br />I give it FIVE out of FIVE stars!!!<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anybody who is a fan of horror films!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book! We read it in class but I never got to finish it so I bought it on here I would definitely read it again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think think that this app is very entertaining and fun. So I love the app and hope others do too!
B008HJGPVO|1.0|I now understand why the stylus comes with three tips, because one tip doesn't last more than a couple of weeks, and you still will have two spares.  The rubber must be rotten for it to fail as quickly as it did.  The one I purchased made by Targus lasted for at least eight months.  I hope this failure of the Amazon multi-tip stylus was only a momentary lapse in quality control and not indicative Amazon products in general.  Please let me know how I may obtain a replacement.
B004UA8D2S|5.0|Good movie awesome!!! Worth save my money plus good price too Thanks very much Have a great day Keep up
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get the app my friends were so addicted and the to scare you yt? struggling to go home and the nigh to scare<br />Skydoesminecraft
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This is an all time favorite of mine.  One of the best dance movies ever produced.  (In my opinion)  So, I decided it was time to add it to my collection.  Very entertaining and such talent!!!  Highly recommend.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used to love kik but now it doesn't work on my kindle anymore it's really annoying . It would load and then say to try again later
B0086449YA|3.0|This is what's becoming a typical Mark Knopfler CD. Some good moments but otherwise an average CD. Most of the songs sound very similar to his past few CD's. Very few songs stand out. The guitar playing is taking more of a backseat to the vocals. That said, it is still pretty good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun n funny to play I got this game on my phne to this game go hard ayyee get it get I
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Lady A. is one of my favorite groups.  The thoroughly enjoyed their past CD's but this one wasn't quite up to the others as far as the songs.  But I still enjoyed listening to it and it did have a few good tracks.
0143124544|5.0|I simply could not put it down once I started. The characters feel real and they pull you. They leave you wondering what happens after the book ends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works well at the touch of my finger.  The perfect brain stimulator when I don't feel like reading at night but can't yet fall asleep.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very addictive and fun game you add coins everyday its lots of fun if you have a few mins to kill you level up pretty quick you get prizes that you can use to get more coins or save to add to your total and it takes you further into the game giving you more games to play and o open great for kids to
B00915G6MG|5.0|We watch the show every week, but it's great to have them on DVD so we can re-watch them without the annoying commercial interruptions. The product arrived at our house in a box specifically designed for DVD's rather than in a manila folder with bubble wrap inside like other companies use.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I never read The Shining. I have read over 25 of his books, but never that one. That's ok though, because you get enough background from this book, so you don't feel lost. Danny Torrance's story really grabbed me. I am referring to the sections of the book that take place while he is still a wandering drunk. King's ability to create characters worthy of our love never ceases to amaze me. Not even just Danny, but Billy, Abra, and even cranky old farts with a heart of gold, like Casey. The True Knot was fascinating. I wish we could find out more about them, and the long ages that they have been roaming. If I had one complaint, it would be that the book was nowhere near long enough. I know that 500-plus pages seems like a lot to many people, but I am always sad to finish a book, when I love it as much as I loved Doctor Sleep.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I read this book in two days....could not put it down.  Molly and Vivien are characters I want to keep following, but the book ended!  I want to know so much more.  Great writing.  Great subjects.  Great story.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell expertly weaves together stories, facts and insights to challenge assumptions about both the powerful and weak in society. Starting with the story of David and Goliath, Gladwell turns power on its head and shows how those without power often have more power than they realize. Drawing on facts and stories from medicine, war, criminal justice and education, Gladwell makes the case that even the most powerful have weaknesses and limits, and how even the weakest among us can wield great power. What makes Gladwell's book so remarkable is that it shares this insight without becoming a call to revolution or uprising, but instead makes the case for a better way that seeks understanding and forgiveness. His argument is persuasive since the path he suggests holds the promise for a better outcome for both the powerful and oppressed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is quick and easy to use, I like how you can change settings to make the screen easier on your eyes so you can read longer and I can fit all of my books in my pocket so I can read what I want
1572814748|5.0|I really like this deck! The size is perfect for carrying it around, The box is sturdy and protects the cards.<br />The colors are nice and good quality print.<br />So cute!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is one of the best things to be seen in British or American TV in many, many years!
B00EHMG358|5.0|Written in the Pendergast style this beginning is a unique opening to bring another character fully on board. Waiting for the rest.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The use of 3d is excellent and the movie still holds up as a great suspensful action film. 30 some bucks is expensive but i split it with a friend and worked out well.
B008LSVLGU|1.0|Perhaps I should have known better. The price was rock bottom. So was Disc 1 & 2. I was so disappointed I never got to the rest of them. Were talking Hammond B3 organ.<br /><br />And Jimmy is maybe the very best B3 player I've ever heard. But this set of CD's didn't do him any favors. The way it was edited left out anything of value. You might recognize a tune here or there...but you won't enjoy it. This shouldn't have been issued in my opinion.<br /><br />ron_of_orange<br />oct 12 2013
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|Good book couldn't stop reading this totally recommend it laugh out loud and I couldn't stop reading this totally recommend book
B00FOQRNLE|5.0|Gladwell challenges the status quo and makes you think. In his new book here he offers challenging insight starting with the Biblical story of David & Goliath all the way to the Huegonots of the mountains in France. In each step he teaches in his unique way how and why underdogs succeed. Thought provoking, well written and worth the read.
B005PK56TA|5.0|IT IS  SCARY AS ALL GET OUT!  I LOVED IT!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ARE A SCARY SHOW KIND OF PERSON.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm thoroughly enjoying the book and more than pleased to find that the HBO series is following it so closely.
B00F03GDGM|4.0|Kaufmann's darker tone won't be to everyone's taste in this music, but the performances are technically very fine. More importantly, he's always a passionate and stylish singer who uses words beautifully.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Different than some of the other level up games. 2 &amp;3 room puzzles to get to the next level! Challenges the brain, especially when you have to remember numbers and colors
B0027MJU00|4.0|Really really liked this book! On the edge of my seat...couldn't put it down. Some very dark stuff...intense...well written...good character development. Can't wait for Gillian Flynn's next book;)
B003G4W49C|5.0|There are so many amazing aspects of this book. It is a true science fiction novel but again it takes everything to a new level. Honestly it starts off slow like you don't know what is going to happen with this ender kid and his creepy brother peter. Once ender arrives in space the whole book changes.  It is A very accurate portrayal of human history and there are points in this book that unless you really like history or have taken a few courses in it you don't get all the references. Even I don't get all the references. It's also really sad that ender is this child, that he is forced to become an adult at the age of six. The whole idea that while ender thought he would be taken on another long journey instead he defeated the buggers without his knowledge blows my mind ... And from the point of him commanding the fleet to him bringing along the new hive is crazy.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews talked about the naked fighting scenes but really people hyped up the nakedness factor. Those fight scenes are important to Enders story and really except for the fact that ender needs a towel afterwards I completely forgot him and bonzo were naked.<br /><br />That  being said I do have some personal opinions of ender and the book. First don't read the authors note I didn't and it helped me to get into the story without the authors expectation going into it. Secondly I think that ender is likely homosexual just because of the peace be with you kisses and the fact that he doesn't crave attention from any of the girls like Petra but feels lonely when rejected or hated by the boys.<br /><br />Other than that this was an amazing book and I an totally see why it's being taught in schools and made into a movie. Imagine the fact that this book was written well before iPads ever came out yet one of the simple technologies they use are &#34;desks&#34; which have all kinds of interactive learning on them. It defiantly makes you appreciate the technologies in science fiction novels and things like Star Trek, because they won't be outlandish in 50 years.things like Star Trek, because they won't be outlandish in 50 years.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Very twisted...maybe slightly more predictable than her other two books but worth it! Makes you wonder about the secrets people keep. Highly recommend.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|I'm no military buff, math or military whiz so as an interested reader growing up in Pensacola in the 1950's with air raid sirens every Friday during school - the old desk drills - I now realize what a naïve people we were.  I (and my parents, I think) believed everything we were told in the news about the government, the military, etc - I also watched those wonderful movies such as Dr. Strangelove and thought - wow - wouldn't it be scary if that's what was going on?<br />While reading Command and Control I realized that Dr. Strangelove was not necessarily a fictional movie.  The personalities involved with keeping the U.S. in one piece are amazing - and the fact that nothing &#34;really bad&#34; happened is nothing short of a miracle.  Eric Schlosser does a great job of humanizing his book...I prayed for all of those young men who were put in danger's way just with the routine maintenance of these deadly missiles and bombs.  We are indeed lucky that we are alive today to even read about how crazy it was then and probably still is.  This sci-fi nerd thought this was a great book.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Suprised it didnt keep me on the edge of my seat. Little flat. Not exciting to me. Cgi was bad.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. This was the first book that made me sod uncontrollably. It also made be laugh and smile and at times made me want a relationship as romantic as theirs. Great book.

Or would you fight back against an unstoppable force... Calamity?<br /><br />One young man does just that.<br /><br />I haven't loved a book this much in ages and I can't wait for the sequel.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The plot thickens. With his co-workers closing in on the Bay Harbor Butcher, Dexter must deviate from his normal routine and get creative. With the help of his &#34;dark passenger&#34; of course. Bringing Deb along for the ride makes for some interesting and very disturbing decisions on both their parts.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|While I am not a hardcore Mayer fan, I have enjoyed his music for many years. I own Continuum and Battle Studies and find both of them to be excellent records, which lead me to purchase Paradise Valley also, and I think this is his best yet. The lyrics, music, composition, production, and vocals are all superb. Thematically it also works very well. There is a fine line between blues and rock and country sometimes, and Mayer toes that line and darts back and forth at times on this record, and the result is phenomenal! This has become one of my favorite albums.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I have had this product for almost a year now and it has not recharged my magic mouse greater than 75% When I first saw this item at the apple store I thought how cool, it is such an apple type of device. after a few visits to the apple store i finally was able to make the purchase. after a few days I don't think it had dawned on me that the Mobe was not fully charging my magic mouse. the charging platforms green light would go solid causing me to believe the mouse was 100% charged. I would use it as normal and occasionally by chance check the bluetooth power level on the desktop. since I had been using the mouse for a while and saw the power was around 75% I didn't think much. over the following few weeks I would sometimes neglect to return the mouse to the charging platform. since i would shut my computer down the move charger would not have usb power anyways so i did not pay much attention to the lower than full charges. after a while the computer would pop up that the bluetooth mouse was at critical battery levels and may shut off without notice. i returned the mouse to the charging platform and left the computer on over night. after this cinerio happening a few times i plugged my iPhone USB charger to the Mobee so i could charge while the computer was off. I was at my witts end because I was so frustrated the mobee platform was indicating a full charge with the green light being full and not blinking. i put two double A batteries in the mouse instead of the mobee rechargeable battery unit and the mouse would no longer work. I suspect the magic mouse has a micro switch on the battery cover or something. I seemed to have misplaced the original battery door after replacing the normal batteries with the mobee inductive rechargeable battery unit. since the fiasco I have purchased a Logitech M705 wireless mouse. I have the Magic Mouse sitting on the Mobee charger 24x7 and the battery level is still at 75% I can still use the multi touch of the magic mouse so it is not a total loss. the m705 battery life is three years. yea, three years. and it uses two regular AA batteries. i am sort of miffed about having to use the logitech dongle but i can get over it because I also got the K750 wireless solar keyboard. both use the same dongle. with the amount of batteries i will save from the landfill with the keyboard and mouse I can put the mobee and magic mouse in the landfill and not feel so bad. The keyboard uses a button battery and can last in a closet for three months before needing a new battery and the solar cells are kind of like a solar calculators so it doesn't require massive light anyways. Since having it for over a month the batter level in the keyboard is still 100%<br />[[ASIN:B005L38VRU Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 for Mac - Silver (920-003472)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003TG75EG Logitech Wireless Marathon Mouse M705 With 3-year Battery Life (910-001935)]]
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Loved the first 3 seasons, which I watched in only 1 week since I am off work temporarily post-surgery.  It was great to be whisked away into another time & country and be entertained with great actors, beautiful scenery, and superb storyline.  Never got bored!  Can't wait until season 4 begins in January on PBS!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|This season was great. It has a lot of twists and turns and kept you in edge. I loved it !

B00DWYRW3E|5.0|I picked up this book at a 4 for $1.00 sale.... this is exceptionally well written, felt as though I were actually observing the life of the characters. I was bereft when I read the final page, wanted it to keep going.  Am searching for other books by this author.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Will Smith and Jaden Smith portray futuristic travelers landing on earth after 1,000 years. An \\"I Am Legend\\" feeling of two military men battling the animal planet gone wild provide an entertaining twist on the typical space opera. I enjoyed this movie and look for more of Jaden.
B00004YZFR|5.0|The music on this CD is timeless. The Rolling Stones are fabulous musicians. I love to put this CD on when I am going for a long drive. It really makes an otherwise mundane drive an enjoyable experience.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Brad Pitt rocks as a zombie fighter struggling at the near-end of humanity. Plausibility need not apply in any zombie flic, but such permeates in this one and thrills for the duration. I'd watch this again - and again.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to the collection of the Greatest Hits of Neil Young. It makes great driving music when I go on  long drives.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|The movie game you what's missing in today's action movies....lots of action, explosions, and butt kicking....with minimal dialogue. It's  worth the watch with all the classic and new guys in there.
B00BNPWBOO|5.0|Well, well. This was my first Primal Scream album and I'm surprised with it. I have listened to it several times and find it addictive. Don't understand why people don't pay more attention to this band.<br />One of the best indie albums I have bought this year (along with Atoms for Peace, Nick Cave's Push the Sky Away, Forest Swords and Arctic Monkeys).  Definately a keeper and one I'll remember over the years. Thanks Primal Scream.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|I love this soundtrack and just about everything about Hans Zimmer. If you need some great music to study to, this is the album for you. Epic and amazing are just the tip of the iceberg for this great collection of instrumental music.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I'm 31 now, having followed Korn since high school. I 'left them' after the issues album, finding nothing I could relate too and getting swamped in all sorts of more sophisticatedor music from all kinds of other genres. I'm happy I returned though, I really like this album. Dynamically better, smarter, more cohesive. Davis has dropped most of the weird quivering voice antics and preferred a harder edged straighter delivery while the music still sounds cool (love the use of electronics). I was pleasantly surprised too to find that the music isn't predictable. It's definately more mainstream than it once was, but not in a bad way, rather a more accessible way. There are still parts that surprise. If you're 'old' like me or you haven't touched them in a while, don't hesitate to buy this one, I think you may find you'll like it. Good work from Korn.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book!  I've been studying metaphysics for 30 years and E2 may be the most simplistic description of how to materialize what you want in your life.  I looked forward to the exercises Ms. Grout provided to demonstrate how easy it is to bring intentions to fruition, although the more difficult I  thought a request from the universe was to become reality, the  less chance I had of delivering the goods!  I'm still waiting for my diamond earrings!  I want to read more from Pam Grout as I enjoy her style of writing.  She incorporates humor with information.  I'm already rereading E2.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|For those who have not read the book but see the musical it bridges the two. Acting was great. Too much criticism of the singing by purists. They do not recognize it was live not dubbed. We have seen it live on Broadway (several times), seen it performed locally, by a touring company and the movie is another version that adds to the enjoyment of the story/music.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|A Nightmare of the Nuclear Apocalypse.<br /><br />A B movie with tons of heart and characters we love.<br /><br />Sci-fi, campy laughs, a moving and effective score, action, suspense, and thrills galore -- 80's style but magically timeless.<br /><br />Now re-mastered...it looks and sounds better than ever (but definitely hold on to the 2001 Special Edition DVD for the documentary &#34;Other Voices&#34; not included on this blu-ray)<br /><br />It's not just a movie...it's a dream on celluloid...so turn the lights out and experience the dream...for years to come.<br /><br />&#34;Are you saying it's from the future?&#34;

B008Y212PI|4.0|The interface - in particular the automatic scrolling is a bit annoying. They also require a review or a fb &quot;like&quot; to unlock bonus puzzles. all in all not bad (this was the FAOTD) but not fabulous.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love this trilogy my only problem is some of the ways its written but love the book still no the less
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I chose this book because I have read &#34;The Better Brain Book&#34;  also by Dr. Permitted and I thought it was a great book, &#34;The Grain Brain&#34; is another book that I think everyone in America should read everyone everywhere should read, but especially America because we are so dependant on grains and fast food!
B005J4TLQG|5.0|For those of you who like sci-fi, the move has very low budget effects, but the movie is solid.  Pretty good acting from a bunch of mostly no-names.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This is exactly what I was expecting.  The case fits very well and the color is great. I would recommend
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The pace wasn't quite how I had hoped it would be, plus it all tied up too fast and predicted.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Could not get the hang of it. I'm glad some people love it but not me. This is why I wish that there were trial periods for some apps. Happy there are reviews to go by.
B006SVHOL8|4.0|Wonderful plot idea, but mass death just isn't that entertaining. Why skimp on the science, especially having both epidemiologists die or be taken out of action? This movie has one of the most anti-climactic endings in cinema history. Get the shot, everything goes &#34;back to normal now.&#34; Really? That's it? Wow. Could have been the new Andromeda Strain, falls short.
B008HK3S9K|4.0|I would have really been satisfied with this envelope if it had any kind of handle. Does the job though and my Kindle is easily recognizable from the other kindled in household.
B00F35BV64|4.0|The movie is entertaining, and I learned from it, because is a new experience. I did not placed five stars on rating, because I did not watched it on HD; thus, I can not say more about its quality. I recommend watching this movie for entertaining purposes to the appropriate audience.

B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My grandson loves this game and every once in a while lets me play it! It is challenging as you learn the different moves each character makes and you have several games in which to use them.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Ok so I have this pop up that tells me my version is outdated. You click on update.Then is takes you to google play right? Well recently my youtube app was outdated  too. I accidentally removed it  from my device. After 're downloaded it. It was updated. So I went to my Facebook app and removed it from my device. I 're downloaded it by going to the Appstore from Amazon. It was updated.It looks almost the same but alot faster. If you dont know how to remove a app you hold your finger down on it and dont let go until a few options comes up. After that click REMOVE FROM DEVICE. Then wait for the app to disappear.

0316204366|2.0|In contrast to previous works by this author, this effort seems worthy of what \\"Caroline Sacks\\" would have written while at the University of Maryland after she realized she was overmatched at Brown.<br /><br />I'm not as slick as Brer Rabbit, nor as honorable as the proclaimed Huguenots of Le Chambon, but I have a good sense of what is worthy of praise.  This book, but for a few interesting paragraphs, (such as those referencing Todd Clear and his insightful writings about sentencing, and the medical drama surrounding childhood leukemia, could just as easily been a collection of stories in The New Yorker magazine.

B00EXVZW6E|3.0|At first glance Hidden Objects Quest 6 has a lot of content: each of twenty-four levels has three quests that can be completed three different ways, plus a bonus quest. The trouble is that, although the quests give you different lists of items to collect, each one uses the same map and hides each object in the same place, so after you've done a couple you're going to start remembering where things are, and get bored tapping them again. Many items are also re-used in different levels, so you'll be even more familiar with (or sick of) them. And some of the items stick out from the backgrounds so thoroughly that it's barely a ~hidden~ object quest. The game tries to liven things up by giving you only object silhouettes, names of objects, scrambled names of objects, various kinds of time limit, etc., but none of this changes the gameplay enough to make each map worth doing a dozen times. Nor do a long but not very enjoyable list of achievements and extra hidden objects to find.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the design is on the cheap side. The background images and some of the objects are horror-themed but not especially spooky, and the rest of the objects (soccer balls, cows) are so not scary they would spoil the mood anyway. The menus are a bit annoying as well. After you select a set of three quests there's no way to go back and switch sets without using your device's back button, which takes you all the way out of the game. And you can't pause or re-start a level in progress. These flaws, like the hilariously tacky opening screens, reveal the cheapness that the game's apparent wealth of content is designed to disguise. If you like hidden object games a lot, enough to play the same level many times with minor variations (and many reviewers evidently do), this is worth paying for. Otherwise, grab it while it's the free app of the day, but don't bother spending money on it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Playing a little deeper into the game and experimenting with all the modes hasn't changed my opinion very much. It eats up time, but it isn't varied or difficult enough to make for real fun. The modes with a strict time limit are the best, but these still become too easy as you learn the never-changing item positions. Some items are obscure enough that there's an unexpected and unpleasant difficulty spike on levels where you just have the name. But, hey there are no penalties for just tapping at random, so you can get a perfect-ranked score even if you don't know what you're finding. (I couldn't tell you what the crank drill looks like, but I've found it twice so far.) Given the lack of a real challenge, I can't bring myself to give this more than a three-star ranking, but if what you want in a hidden-object game is simplicity, this is definitely one to pick up while it's free, or even once it's not.hasn't changed my opinion very much.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Courage and distance. Would she have written had she not read Doug's obituary and ventured into the basement to visit her mouldering Monster and it's tattered feather?<br /><br />On reflection, all of our lives' stories range from desolation to exultation. Cheryl's story of a slice of her life unfolds with an honest grace.  I finished the book with respect for the author, for the toughness of all of the women I've met on trails and off, and with the pleasure of having read a very well crafted book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|there are some tricky parts which make the game fun and challenging for all ages. alot of missions i dont have many problems it is a very fun experience.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Whether you're new to Harry, or previously had some or most of his RCA work, you can't go wrong with this collection. Absolutely everything he recorded for RCA, including many demos, out takes and rarities. Lovely packaging, recreating the original album covers.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are ok.  They often seem a little repetitive.  Some are quite challenging.  Overall, the ap is ok- not bad, but not my favorite.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have always like logic problems and was fascinated with this idea.  I started with the easiest and have worked my way to the more challenging puzzles.  The only thing I can think of to say I dislike is the hoorah you go through to unlock more puzzles; but, I don't dislike it enough to downgrade my rating.<br />I got this as a free app of the day and I'm thinking of purchasing other games of this nature.<br />I would recommend this game for anyone who likes solving puzzles and pretty artwork.
B000PMG16U|4.0|This set most of the special features from previous releases. But the only downside is the only way to truly have almost all the bonus features ever released is to buy the Complete Saga Set, buying the two trilogies individually on blu-ray only gives you the features that you would have found on DVD sets.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I remember a reviewer who wrote a very positive review of the Sci Fi film 'Soylent Green' by saying something like 'it's a fine line between campy schlock and a profound film'. Oblivion straddles this line. There's also a fine line between a film that is derivative and one that 'pays homage' to films that have come before it. Oblivion rests there too. There are also one's out there, I suspect, that are not sure what kind of film they want to be. 'Oblivion' resists easy categorization. It has romantic and fantasy elements throughout the film. The viewer never knows where the film is leading to. With Jack Harper's memories being erased, and Earth's past something we grow increasingly unsure of, the events make a good mystery. Oblivion ends up being a feel-good experience of the highest caliber. As loose ends of the film are tied up in improbably ways, the film goes more into a mode of fantasy. As the events become more unbelievable, or at least unlikely, the film becomes more dreamlike. This could seem like a cop-out on the part of the filmmakers, but I enjoyed the film perhaps even more because of it, or because of the way it was done. I've come back to this review *spoilers ahead* and I must ask, how can the film have such an upbeat ending when there's no water left on the Earth? Was the fantasy at the end meant to literally be a dream of a doomed Earthman?<br /><br />Oblivion reminds me of an old Outer Limits episode titled, 'Hearts and Minds'. An episode where human soldiers find themselves fighting an alien enemy, or at least an enemy they believe to be alien, when in reality they are fighting other humans - other humans who have been led to believe they are fighting an alien enemy. The film makers may have examined this other work of art before crafting this one. The most startling line to me in the film is when Jack Harper is getting ready to fly into the forbidden 'radiation zone' and when asked what he will find one of the humans says to the other, \\"he will find his destiny\\". This is obviously taken from the original Planet of the Apes film where one ape asks another what 'Taylor' (Charlton Heston) will find inside the forbidden zone and the ape replies, \\"he will find his destiny\\" or simply \\"His destiny\\". It's probably the second most memorable line in the film after \\"Get your paws off me you damn dirty ape\\". The line makes no sense other than 'go out and find your destiny' until the end of the film or until the second viewing where it becomes obvious that the ape knows in the forbidden zone Taylor will discover he's on planet Earth and his destiny is to be replaced by apes. There was really no need to have a 'forbidden zone' inside the Ape film except perhaps to add mystery to it? It does bring to mind, are the apes so racist they will outlaw travel to half the continent over fears apes will discover they are not the pure 'firsts'? In this film we never really learn what is inside the radiation zones for Jack Harper decides not to go into them other than flying near. One might wonder in hindsight if he would find huddled remnants of a dying humanity but we never discover what is there. For whatever reason, perhaps film length, this is a plot development that goes no where and we are treated with something else to interest us instead.<br /><br />Oblivion owes it's greatest debt to the recent invasion movie 'Skyline'. One where humans face an impersonal, and really unseen, enemy. An enemy who has us fighting ourselves, in a sense. I think the mimicry of so many of these general human themes or archetypes works out in a good way. The familiarity of the subject matter, combined with the uncertainty of where the film is going, move the audience even more. Notice the uncertain relationship between the subservient Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his female superiors, including the female head of NASA, as we are exposed to this film supposedly taking place in the future. It's a mystery for us to ponder. Then we can't help but notice the strong Southern accent of this bureau chief, even as we discover Morgan Freeman is somehow her enemy and we're not yet sure why. We only ever see this one NASA chief, 'Sally', always wondering what is behind her, something that is never really resolved even at the end of the film. Yes, obviously it is not really this NASA chief we are seeing but only a facade set before some kind of alien intelligence that is mimicking her. The most likely guess is that this may be some kind of automated enemy. Certainly a very cold one, at the least. It might be interesting to compare Sally to the computer villain 'HAL 9000' in the film '2001 A Space Odyssey'.<br /><br />I really liked this film and was moved by it. I give it 9 out of 10 stars. I liked the love affair within the movie, too. I must admit to not being an unbiased viewer.outhern accent of this bureau chief, even as we discover Morgan Freeman is somehow her enemy and we're not yet sure why.

B00DNNQNW0|5.0|I discovered Katie Melua on YouTube, singing &#34;Stardust,&#34; of all things. She is a young, talented singer and song-writer originally from Georgia (not the U.S. one) and now living in the UK. She does mostly blues and jazz. She's delivered seven albums; Ketevan (which is her Georgian name) is the latest. Unlike most of her earlier albums, this one contains all new pieces written by Katie or by her producer, Mike Batt, or his son Luke. Katie and the Messrs. Batt work so well together they might as well be triplets. If you like Norah Jones, or if you liked Anita O'Day, you'll most likely love Katie. She did a US tour in 2009. It's time we saw her here again!

0440246318|1.0|The novel builds in tension during the first half.  In fact, the part in the car trying to escape is good.  But once they head off the highway, and the suspects try to get rid of Reacher, the novel falls apart. In fact, the second half is very poor.  Once Reacher meets up with The FBI agent, Sorenson, the story gets very unbelievable.  First of all – an FBI agent would never let a stranger be armed and carry out an investigation with her or him.  Then, how the three protagonists went to take on the terrorists all by themselves was very suspect.  Two women (or even male) FBI agents and Reacher taking on a highly defended<br />terrorist camp is laughable.  And the reason was to save the undercover agent, McQueen, who had been in<br />an undercover position for months.  Why worry about him now?<br />Also, how could the terrorists (Syrians?)  take over the old massive DOD base? No one would catch on?  Where did all the people in the base come from?  Who was the leader and why?  What was the immediate danger from the terrorists if there was no active radioactivity or bombs there?  The explanation that it was a bank for terrorists was laughable!  A bank for terrorists in the middle of the prairie of Missouri?  Come on?

B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|It is rare when a new release lives up to the expectations that you have for it, and Warren Haynes has such a wide portfolio of outstanding music to measure up to. Shout has far exceeded my expectations and I have been playing almost non-stop since it arrived.<br /><br />I first heard \\"World Boss\\" and \\"Captured\\" at the Gov't Mule show at The Warfield in San Francisco in September 2012 and knew there must be a new studio album in the near future.  What I didn't expect was that this would be one of the best Mule albums ever.<br /><br />In addition to the great diversity of the songwriting on the disc, the bonus disc is nothing short of spectacular. Dr. John's vocals on \\"How Could You Stoop So Low\\", to Elvis Costello on \\"Funny Little Tragedy\\" and Steve Winwood on \\"When The World Gets Small\\" would make the framework for an outstanding musical adventure all on their own.<br /><br />\\"Shout\\" is one of the best collections of music I have had heard in quite some time.  Don't pass this one up!<br /><br />Can't wait to see Gov't Mule at the Fox Theater in Oakland on Halloween!!!!

My husband and I are convinced that this program can have very beneficial health effects, plus sustainable weight loss.

Love the whole format, graphics, ease of use, zoom, mini-games, decorating a room and each time you restart or play under a different profile, the game is never exactly the same. Just one issue that keeps me from giving it 5 stars:  the game freezes completely at level 89 and I have to either wait for it to reset and go in under another profile or re-install, either way, I have to start all over again. DEVELOPERS, PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE!!!&nbsp;Also, would be cool to add more options for decorating your room.  Other than that, great game!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing!!!!!!! We watched the entire season in 2 days!!!! A must see!!! great story line, great actors! We are ready for asylum!!!
B00F36ZHHC|2.0|I had to unload it because it kept causing my Kindle Fire to lock up.  Maybe it just isn't designed to work on my device.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My name is Ellie. This game of good. I'm always playing it and its fun. It should stay free. Bye.
B000I9YX06|5.0|Will Smith brings it home, in this sci-fi thriller. This one has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing till the very end.
B00957T6X6|4.0|No break in stories or books. Over all I enjoyed the kindle version and if you like hbo you'll win
B00138J4B4|2.0|What happened during the eighties? Im assuming its the synth, computers, and drum machines. So many great artists just coundnt get through that decade with anything worthwhile. Go get a box set from any \\"classic rock\\" artist. Jeff Beck, Crosby Stills Nash, Jethro Tull,Neil Young, etc. Start playing the tracks in order and its obvious to see when the eighties came. The songs are computer aided, lifeless, soulless crap. You can hear the fake loud drum machine kick in. The synthesizer is right there behind it. The echo effect vocals appear. Its so terrible.  I know there are some exceptions of course, but on to many occasions, its just nothing there from hugely talented artists.<br />I know this is more of a tirade against 80s music more than a review of this album, but this album finally pushed me over the edge where I had to say something.<br /><br />Dont you guys wonder how Jimi Hendrix would have sounded making a ,say, 1984 album?
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|ALOT of fun, challenging, great graphics and easy to loose alot of time playing it.  Its a good free game
B003O86FMW|5.0|Last spring I was flying to a work conference & my coworker was reading the 1st & 2nd books. On the plane ride there were a couple of others also in their late 20's reading them. My coworker said they were really good books. A month or two ago my 10 year old daughter begged to get them on our kindles. She read all 3 books in about a week I bet & just raved about them! She has been hounding me to read them, especially with the 2nd movie coming out shortly. So, about a week ago I started the 1st one & just finished the 2nd & can't wait to start the 3rd hear in just a minute!
B005MTHRAA|5.0|Maria Callas was a woman of incredible talents on the opera stage and they are now available to us on this film---even without her great singing!
B008Y212PI|4.0|i love this game but you should update your pics. I think you should try humorous. pics in the game.
0152465073|5.0|Some books are elevated into classics the very moment they are published----this is one of them.  Read it and be transported!
B000PMG16U|5.0|Great movies, great quality. Came in the mail quickly and efficiently, and I gave it to my dad as a gift for Christmas.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Casting is supreme in this over the top musical------combining love, and raunch------in an atmosphere of the seedy times of prohibitaion in Chicago!
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is pretty cool to have an endless game (as frustrating as that can be) you can just keep playing it. Other games I just keep replaying but having an endless game stops me from having to do that!
0316069884|5.0|I recommend everyone to read this book. I learned a lot about the relation between meat consumption and pollution and how we can save the earth by being vegetarian.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|Easy to use and my Grandaughter loves it.  It makes her feel like I can be there to read her a story.
0783225733|5.0|Loved this movie.  It is a great study of how we can make the best of a situation when things go wrong.  Good actors, too!
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|The best &#34;Much Ado&#34; yet. Whedon cut the text well. Though the Bard didn't always trip of the actors' tongues they more believable performances than the stage actors in the 1993 version. Amy Acker is a gift.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is addictive! Great way to pass the time, just wish I would know enough to put the Kindle Fire down instead of continuing to hut the &quot;play&quot; button. Lots of fun.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|First of all, I like Marvel, well done as always, it never feels like a let down, always entertaining. Excellent.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I read this book as a young girl and remember it differently.  Maybe I am remembering a combination of more than one book.  It could also be that I was either to young to understand this classic or the variant English used was, and is a little confusing in spite of looking up a few words.  It is an excellent story, however I feel that the modern child today would have a hard time getting into it because they would doubt the divisiveness of some of characters or even the evil doings of Heathcliff.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Sad that there are only 4 seasons. This series is one of the very best. Ranking very close to Downton Abby.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is an interesting search game. The concept is different than most other search games I've played before. So far I'm enjoying it. The graphics and quests are well done.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I saw the ads at flinders and other stations and I loved the characters. Now I can play the game, how great!
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Its awesome that I can watch and listen to the band when they aren't touring near me.  Greatest buy ever.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Just could not get interested in the book.  Did not finish it.  May go back to it later and try again.
0553381709|5.0|I love the character development in the book and the way in which the material is presented. Lots of twists and turns and a great story line.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have only finished the beginner levels, but I cannot wait to try the bigger, more challenging puzzles. The ending pictures are pretty.
B002OPZ37E|5.0|It was literally brand new besides a small (really small) crack in the front of the case. No big deal. Definitely worth the cost! Got here in a decent amount of time. 100% would recommend.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The 3D version of this film has very good punchy 3D, the only downside might be that over half of the film is filmed with rather dark scenes that don't maximize the 3D since 3D looks best in brightly lit images, however, the last 40 minutes, with the climatic battle scene, has some of the most dazzling 3D content one could hope to see in film. Another nice thing about this film is that the aspect ratio is such that it fills the whole screen of one's flat screen TV so one gets a fully enlarged image from which to enjoy the 3D.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Kline weaves a tale of two ladies who couldn't be more different from each other and we Learn just how much they have in common.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|The 3D version of this movie is not particularly amazing. The 3D is not very punchy and the 3D is mostly limited to the displacement of space behind the TV and not the space between the TV and the viewer, though even the deep space doesn't often seem magnified to any great degree. There are a few instances when shards of glass seem to blow out into the viewers space, but other than that don't expect much 3D effects in front of the screen. I found the 3D on movies like Dredd, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Resident Evil: Retribution, Prometheus, or The Avengers to be much more thrilling to watch. If one has enhancements on their TV to exaggerate the 3D then this helps somewhat but still it doesn't come close to comparing with some of the other films I've mentioned. The aspect ratio on this film is such that it does fill the whole screen so that is a plus. The movie itself is also well done, but if one already has it on blu-ray then one might not find it worth upgrading to 3D.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|Not as good as some of their previous work, but it is still an excellent Enigma CD. Haunting music and melodies. I highly recommend it for old and new fans alike!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Incredibly well written, wonderfully acted period drama. I was late jumping on the bandwagon but now I'm hooked. Season 3 has some serious twists and turns that will leave you in tears and wondering how you can possibly watch Season 4...but I will!  Highly recommend giving it a go.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is one of Enya's Best CD's. It has the classic &#34;Enya Sound&#34; with the layering of voices. Every song is a masterpiece. I highly recommend this for older or newer fans!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I'm ashamed to say that I've never watched these until now. I'm now 31 and have only watched a few episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. I've always liked a Sci-fi but I generally gravitate to more action oriented shows or movies.  That said I have been pleasantly surprised by this show.  It holds up extremely well. The video quality on an iPad with retina was quite surprising.  The storyline is very interesting in the episodes I've seen. I also like how this includes the pilot that was never actually released because it didn't fit the mold of space western.  I have not yet watched the entire season but I've been impressed with what I've seen so far.
B001NHNG64|5.0|AFTER READING TWO OF LEE CHILD NOVELS I WOULD CONSIDER HIM TO BE A 5 STAR AUTHOR.  I WOULD HAVE TO RANK HIM RIGHT UP THERE WITH DAVID BALDACCI, TOM CLANCY, AND JOHN GRISHAM!!!!  I LOOK FORWARD TO READING MANY OTHER NOVELS FROM THIS AUTHOR.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This two CD set contains just about every MJ classic tune that you could possibly think of!!! Thriller,Beat It,Man In The Mirror,Smooth Criminal,Billie Jean...they are all on here. Plus so much more! This collection is a must for every MJ fan! Highly recommend!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works properly for me so far. Helps great when I can't take my laptop with me. :) Thank you!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's okay... peeta and katniss need more romance though I love the hunger games. Team Gale yup. Gale is perfect
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great for when I don't have my laptop and it works properly for me so far! It's worth the download! :D
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|They only let you go so far and you have no choice but to spend money or you can not move past level 1
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is an absolutely amzing because you get to hunt many sorts of animals not jest feeds .anyways you should really get this game .signed tribute 2
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever to be made i really love it and i this game u need to buy it
B001YV506S|1.0|After having purchased a large number of movies from Amazon, I am very unhappy and disappointed that we cannot watch them in Australia because they have a different code...and I am not able / cannot afford to buy a new multi zone DVD player...
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book sucked . It doesn't have the words I'm looking for. I really really really really very very sucked.fudge you
B00A2DIW3C|4.0|I was surprised to learn that some of what I had considered very recent developments in stealth aircraft are decades old. A great example of how a small group of especially talented individuals overseen by a wise and charismatic leader can accomplish magnificent things in a short time.
B00A6WSTIW|5.0|Watched many many times -- always enjoyed it.  No shortage of action -- all the way through the movie.  Enjoy!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A work of speculative fiction that evokes Orwell's 1984, as well as Facebook, Google, and Scientology. There is a strange thrill to read it on a handheld device. Anyone who worries about the end of privacy will be fascinated.
0316010669|5.0|This book provides a fascinating look at how people make snap decisions.  It was given to me as part of a training course and is not something I would normally read.  That said, the book is enjoyable and does a great job of explaining complex ideas.  The author, Malcolm Gladwell, frequently ties specific topics to points made in earlier chapters.  This writing style ties the entire book together and allows the reader to obtain a holistic understanding of his theory.<br /><br />The author makes his points through both examples and tests.  For example, most people do not consider themselves to be racist.  The book, however, has the reader take a simple test that illustrates how our unconscious mind may not be as race neutral as we would think.<br /><br />Another example is the case of Amadou Diallo, an African American who was shot by several New York police officers.  During the trial, the prosecution argued that the police were racist.  The defense argued that it was an accidental and unavoidable shooting caused by the stress of the moment. The author, however, believes that the shooting was neither motivated by racism nor was it unavoidable.  Instead, the officers became temporarily autistic or \\"mind blind\\" as they escalated the situation.  In the end, they were not able to process the data in their unconscious mind which resulted in them overreacting.<br /><br />The book has numerous examples that cover everything from the Pepsi Challenge taste test to a war game in which the underdog won a surprising victory.  In all these examples, the author argues that our unconscious mind can process data faster than our conscious mind.  Sometimes we over think problems and are distracted by too much data.<br /><br />Bottom line: The author does a great job of presenting his complex theory in an easy to understand format.  This is a fascinating book that is easy to read, even for people who do not normally read these types of books.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It was wonderful follow these characters again. I am learning so much about wold history and the bravery of \\"the greatest generation.\\"
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is fun. Keeps me entertained and is somewhat educational. My son knows how to load a flame thrower!
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|The 80's redone.  Lots of very catchy songs with a dance rhythm. Highly recommended.  Female vocals are very clean and not annoying.
1594202273|3.0|The book would  have benefitted from some serious editing.  It suffers from too much irrelevant and wordy asides.  The ostensible central story, the Damascus incident, is presented in bits and pieces and stretches on as far as the eye can see. An interesting book that suffers from excessive padding.
160774418X|5.0|I love the forward and introduction to the book.  The recipes are innovative, different and not too complicated.  I can't wait to impress my family and friends.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|I began reading this book as a follow-up to the excellent Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson.  What a great book this was!  Steve Wozniak was the sole engineer who designed/invented the Apple computer, the first personal computer that worked with a keyboard and TV monitor.  If you know anything about Steve Wozniak, you know that he is a down-to-earth and very honest regular guy.  The wonderful thing about this book is that this is way the book reads and flows.  Therefore, it's a very enjoyable and quick read.<br /><br />Steve tells how his father explained engineering principles to him in such a way that he understood them completely and absorbed the information.  This became the foundation of his passion and interest in engineering.<br /><br />\\"The Woz\\" explains every step in his quest to design a personal computer, since he couldn't afford to buy one.  He always kept redesigning this computer on paper, trying to utilize as few chips as possible.  In between, we hear about his beloved job at Hewlett-Packard, building a \\"blue box\\" (device that makes free long distance phone calls), creating a dial-a-joke service, designing a game for Atari, and inventing the first universal remote.  This man is brilliant, and Steve Jobs knew it.<br /><br />Wozniak discusses the working atmosphere at Apple, his marriages, owning a movie theater, funding the US Music Festival, his love of being a father and becoming a computer teacher at his kids' school.<br /><br />This is an excellent book told in an honest and informative fashion.  In addition, it is the perfect companion to reading the Steve Jobs book.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|pretty fun game. on kindle fire though it will shut down after one hunt and you have to open the game to hunt again. would be great if this did not happen. please fix this problem and your game would be better for me
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great story.  Would make interesting conversation at a book club as the currency of today is there
B000W2W4JQ|5.0|I love this book ! It was a little hard to find the version of it that I wanted , but I'm so glad I did because it truly is a little treasure.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this several years ago for the first time and was impressed by the slow progression and digression into madness by Jack. After seeing the Kubrick film and read the book again in anticipation of Doctor Sleep, I was just as enthralled by this book and actually found the film less terrifying by comparison. Unmask!!
B00A0SICYI|5.0|This movie is a timeless family classic.  Great music and fun theme.  Dick Van Dyke is the best.  And of course, who could forget Truly Scrumptious?  Definitely a must watch!  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang our fine four fendered friend.
1423136802|5.0|I purchased this for my 11 year old son, although I started reading it first!  The humor mixed into the story really caught our attention right off.  It is a nice set, well packaged and a good price.  Great for any kid who likes fantasy literature.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of my high school students recommended this book. At first I thought it would be a coming of age story. It had so many mysteries and twists that I could not put it down. Highly magical yet quite unpredictable.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Having Blu-ray, DVD, and digital format in one package makes it worth it.  The movie is a lot of fun and continues in the same vein as the first.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I don't usually gush about movies, but this is the first movie in recent memory that I felt valued my time as a viewer. It reminded me of films that were made before the age of technology (which was sort of the point of the film). The story, and the viewer's imagination, carried the whole film. I felt that  my time was being respected, that everything I was being shown had narrative justification, and that my intelligence was also being valued. I saw this film in the theatre and put it on my &#34;to buy&#34; list right away. I was not disappointed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is very fun I play it all day as soon as I get home I grab my kindle fire and play play play all day after school I even play at soccer pratice
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Cant beat it. No one rocked better LIVE and this proves it. Download worked well and will buy more again from Amazon when I need it.
B008RYN44U|3.0|My wife was a huge No Doubt fan back in the days, so she wanted their new album. She said it was ok, not their best work, but good for the times. She listens to it every once and a while.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|I like it. Really. I do.  Especially Counting Stars. That is why I bought this album. I like all of it tho. You can hear it on the radio too.
B00DYVUBYM|1.0|I have always loved Sophia Coppola's movies. They are smart, thoughtful social commentaries. But this movie was just scene after scene of grotesque and extreme juvenile delinquency. I watched with my teenage daughter and she walked out after the first half. She said she knows of no teenagers that are that foul-mouthed, amoral, and drug/alcohol addicted. We had hoped that there was some intent for their desire for chic-ness.  We knew it was a movie about a gang of delinquent teenagers who rob celebrity homes. But in the end, the movie seemed less about that then about the continuous stream of gross language and nightclub drug scenes. Sophia seemed intent in trying to shock the viewer.  Other than the scenes in Paris Hilton's closet (the only fun part of the movie), one is left with the unanswered question of why this group of friends stole designer wear and jewelry for their own personal adornment.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the case.  It felt soft and expensive.  The ability to prop the kindle at a number of angles helps when I'm reading on the bed.  Really enjoy it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game provides fun for the whole family, especially the young ones. Time seems to fly by while playing it, especially when you're waiting in an appointment.. I highly recommended to everyone.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I actually downloaded 2 more of their tables.  Good quality tables, doesn't come off as cheap.  Someone took the time to make them look really good.  The game play is also very smooth.  I play it almost every night for a few minutes.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great tool! If only it could display more that would be nice. But I think they are working on it. Great device! Love it!
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I didn't think it was going to be good and I felt I was going to waste my money, but when I listened to it, I actually found it growing on me! If you look past - 4x4, SMS and Love Money party- It's not a bad album. I don't think she should be trying so hard to compete with Rihanna, and should find her own sound and way of music. This album is very much like a few Rihanna albums I love, songs about jerk guys, and edgy rap, with some pop. I have to say, she's very much so, left the Disney apron string behind. But, I feel this rap deal, and working with so many urban rap artists, isn't going to hold the appeal of her fans and maybe going back to doing kinda the Katy Perry, Lady Gaga thing would be better.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An amazing story about an amazing American. Hard to describe how close to home this story hits. Everyone should read this
B007A4SDCG|5.0|FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS A SWIFT KICK IN THE PANTS.... this was made for you!!!! I highly recommend this book!
B000AS4L16|5.0|I was under impression the dvds would be in English so at first I was a bit disappointed I had to read subtitles since dvds were in foreign language. But since the story is so incredible as is it really didn't matter to me that it was not in English after all... once you watch it you will never be the same.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Nice tie ins to important characters from the old series and movies.  A little cheesy at times but that's kind of what we love about Star Trek.  Nice effects.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have worn out 5 or 6 copies of this classic, and after needing something to read on a long flight, I bought the ebook version. I've read it through, and hadn't found the misspellings I've found in ither ebooks.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I love this series. These remastered disks are fantastic. If you are a Star Trek Original Series fan, then you will not be disappointed with this set.
B00EO10M54|5.0|Not album of the YEAR by any means, haha...but it doesn't suck at all!!  Please, go into this with an open mind, have low expectations, and you will probably enjoy it and have newfound respect for Miley...as hard as it is to believe...she ACTUALLY knows what she is doing.  I wasn't expecting to like it, or even BUY it, but &#34;Bangerz&#34; has been getting some great reviews in respected publications, which caught my attention (A- in EW for instance), and 2 friends of mine (males 50+) actually bought it and loved it...one even rebought &#34;Can't Be Tamed&#34; & loved it!!  Then I saw the deluxe on sale at a good price, I said &#34;what the hell&#34; and bought it...popped it on and was surprised how good it was!!  I don't buy much hiphop, BUT I do like when a pop album uses a hiphop base to build on and take the sound in multiple creative directions, and that's this album's notable achievement in my eyes...there were some visionaries behind &#34;Bangerz&#34;, most definitely, PLUS, this record has some really SNEAKY hooks, like on 1st single &#34;We Can't Stop&#34;...I hated it at first, but it was really sneaky, and I really love it now.  And before the album, I had never heard &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34; before...all I knew was that (besides the naked riding-the-wrecking-ball vidclip) it was labelled a synth ballad...NOPE!!  If anything, it's a good-to-great Katy Perry-styled catchy-as-hell pop song in bigvoiced powerballad form, and it works beautifully...no wonder: Dr Luke was behind it!!  I also enjoyed the Nelly-assted country/hiphop hybrid &#34;4X4&#34;...it reminds me of the Big & Rich/Cowboy Troy Muzik Mafia &#34;hick-hop&#34; records from 5-10 years ago, and works just as well...it seems every song, even the 3 bonus tracks, have a little creative trick up its sleeve...and the songs work together well as an album of linked songs, not singles-plus-filler...<br /><br />All in all...&#34;Bangerz&#34; could have been a serious hot mess, like her Twerk extravaganza on the VMA's, but it's genuinely one of the nicest little surprise albums of 2013...and makes me think Ms Cyrus in a whole new light...that in itself is some achievement!!a on the VMA's, but it's genuinely one of the nicest little surprise albums of 2013...and makes me think Ms Cyrus in a whole new light...that in itself is some achievement!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|So friends were all like download kik, and so i did and guess what? It's freaking busted. Keeps timing out on me, and obviously several others. Is there going to be a fix? Or are we all now just screwed????? :(
B00BMBA2CC|5.0|I know I'm guilty of throwing the word GENIUS around too much lately, but Charli really DOES deserve that title, espesh with this, her full debut album \\"True Romance\\".<br /><br />Question is why...why is this young woman a genius??  Or is this album genius??  I'd say both.  And what's great about it is the element of surprise...you don't EXPECT it to be as great as it is...or how great Charli is as a songwriter and her own artist...she is kindred spirits with her Down Under doppelganger Kimbra in that they were both featured artists on breakout hits by other artists...Kimbra on Gotye's \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" and Miss Charli on Icona Pop's \\"I Love It\\"...but their OWN debut records are better, more interesting & more distinctive than those featured artists and hits.<br /><br />What's even cooler is that Charli lets the music speaks for itself, and is not shouting down people's throats \\"HEY LOOK AT ME!!  CHECK OUT MY RECORD!!\\"...she seems confident enough to believe that people will embrace her music and take her to heart as their new favourite artist and a secret that no one else knows.  Yes, word of mouth will spread and the \\"Cult of Charli\\" will have begun...not far off from the US Cult of Marina & the Diamonds...it's a LOT bigger than you would believe (I went to see Marina at the Paramount in Huntington, Long Island last year supporting \\"Electra Heart\\" thinking it would be a sizable audience but not huge, but all of a sudden, the place was overrun by all these teenage misfit girls with tiny black hearts drawn on their cheeks, like HUH??  Where did these girls come from??)....or in bigger cases, Lorde and HAIM...don't be surprised if the \\"Cult of Charli\\" has started to spread already.<br /><br />But OK, what about the MUSIC??  Well, she catches you completely offguard and floors you with her dark catchy bold brilliance...starting with opener \\"Nuclear Seasons\\"...it's a minute-long intro which is lowkey and you have no idea what to expect (if you never heard the song before...I only heard it once in a vidclip on YouTube, knew it was great but forgot HOW great)...then it BOOM kicks in with the most enticing, lovely dark synth-based melody, and your jaw takes over and promptly hits the floor...then the fun \\"You (Ha Ha Ha)\\" where the melody is so catchy, arrangement so off-the-wall, and lyrics bold, brave and explicit...you won't hear this cool tune on the radio without bleeps all over it...but it's OK, the song is too cool for radio anyway...\\"So Far Away\\" is a lovely song, \\"You're The One\\" is another killer...all 13 cuts are so good, diverse-yet-unified...and really proclaims an amazing & fun new artist has been unveiled...<br /><br />She is just amazingly cool...a total punk but with KILLER pop hooks that just slay, and dark, complex intelligent lyrics to boot...she makes being a great pop artist not a BAD thing...you CAN be pop and not be formulaic or a slave to radio or a hit singles machine...you can be pop AND be art as well...<br /><br />AMAZING record, Charli XCX is an amazing artist, PERIOD...AND she has album #2 ready to go...a video has already been unveiled on YouTube...this Britgirl is just unstoppable!!  Can't wait for more!!  Another killer UK record on similar genius lines is the debut album \\"Body Music\\" by co-ed duo ALUNAGEORGE!!the song before...I only heard it once in a vidclip on YouTube, knew it was great but forgot HOW great)...then it BOOM kicks in with the most enticing, lovely dark synth-based melody, and your jaw takes over and promptly hits the floor...then the fun \\"You (Ha Ha Ha)\\" where the melody is so catchy, arrangement so off-the-wall, and lyrics bold, brave and explicit...you won't hear this cool tune on the radio without bleeps all over it...but it's OK, the song is too cool for radio anyway...\\"So Far Away\\" is a lovely song, \\"You're The One\\" is another killer...all 13 cuts are so good, diverse-yet-unified...and really proclaims an amazing & fun new artist has been unveiled...<br /><br />She is just amazingly cool...a total punk but with KILLER pop hooks that just slay, and dark, complex intelligent lyrics to boot...she makes being a great pop artist not a BAD thing...you CAN be pop and not be formulaic or a slave to radio or a hit singles machine...you can be pop AND be art as well...<br /><br />AMAZING record, Charli XCX is an amazing artist, PERIOD...AND she has album #2 ready to go...a video has already been unveiled on YouTube...this Britgirl is just unstoppable!!

B00CU8QB9Y|4.0|It shows the human side of the author. some times funny and a amusing. I would recommend it if you are a fan of his books
B005QN3ANK|3.0|I thought that this would be up to the same standard of music as their first two CD's, but I found myself lacking.
B00004RF9I|5.0|When I saw this movie in 1978 as a 13 year old, I found it mildly amusing. Today at 48, I realize what this movie is about, and it is shocking. Sure, it's funny and bizarre, but also sickening in that this movie is about the vultures that we are, and how we are as guilty as anybody for drinking the sewage that the networks give us. I grieve for the Howard Beale character, and that nobody helped him, but then I tell myself that it's only just a movie.... But then I stop and realize that it isn't just a movie. It's about us.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This film will take you back to the 20th century folded art period of Paris. You will feel the creative power of American lit.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wow.  Great book.  Stephen you're back in business.  Liked the flashes of the shinning and all the new characters.  The story rose then mellowed then got exciting again.  I could not put it down.  I may never see people in RV s the same way as I see them in parks or on the road.  I would love to see a picture of the hat lady to understand the tilt of her hat.  definitely a good book!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I tried loging into kik but then it said its taking longer than it should try again later and i waited days to see if it would work and it didnt i even deleted it and it still didnt help at all !!!! Im disappointed they need to fix this now
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|As an avid student of spirituality, consciousness, quantum physics, metaphysics and a host of other complex theories, I enjoyed the simplicity of this book. I greatly appreciate the stories and comparisons that were used to clarify scientific/spiritual principles. Pam communicates in a way that made me feel like she is the sister (the dear friend, the kindred spirit) that really gets me...feels me and genuinely wants to see me thrive. The exercises are fun, creative and absolutely transformational. The entire experience was really cool.
B00F9040HU|1.0|I love this game but would not have downloaded if I knew you were forced to buy if after playing for a limited time. Going forward, it would be ethical to inform players of this fact.<br />Lori Cowee  :(
B008TRH5N6|5.0|A must read for seekers of the Truth. When I started to read it, I could not stop till I finish the book. The book is practical and easy to read. Lots of scientific prayer models.

B008JFUNKU|4.0|Unless you're familiar with the actual real life event \\"Captain Phillips\\" is based on, you can really only judge the action thriller as a film and how much it entertains you rather than how accurate it actually is. As far as captivation goes, \\"Captain Phillips\\" is absolutely exhilarating at times. The film is a pretty even balance between Phillips, his crew, and preparation for a pirate attack and it even touches on why the Somali pirates do what they do. If they wanted to eat that day, they'd go out, find a ship, and hope its cargo was valuable so their bosses would shower them with reward money. When the two worlds finally collide, it's this really vigorous game of tug of war as you sympathize with Phillips and his crew as they are only trying to protect the load they're transferring along with the lives of those they work with while the group of pirates begins to crumble from within due to their unreasonable greed, stubborn attitudes, and the constant desire to find the mother load that would make them rich.<br /><br />Director Paul Greengrass has become notorious for utilizing what most refer to as the shaky camera technique, however the technique in \\"Captain Phillips\\" isn't an issue in the slightest and that's coming from someone who can't stand the craze. The camera work in \\"Captain Phillips\\" almost feels like guerrilla filmmaking as every scene makes the audience feel like they're right along with the crew of the Maersk Alabama being held hostage and fighting for their lives. The perspective that seems like the camera man is capturing the scene with his life on the line while taking cover and the way there's just the right amount of movement to feel authentic without coming off as sloppy causes the film to be mesmerizing from beginning to end.<br /><br />While Phillips' crew mostly all bleeds together, the pirates are significant thanks to their short fuses, extreme tempers, and outrageous attitudes. Nearly everyone in Muse's crew becomes wide-eyed, screams at the top of their lungs, and threatens the lives of several innocent people throughout the course of the film. They easily become memorable thanks to how exaggerated their characters are. Barkhad Abdi is the most extraordinary as Muse as he seems to be the type of man who would rather sit back and see how things play out and yet isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Muse is a man who's set in his ways and refuses to give in even when the odds are against him and Abdi portrays the character with a kind of grace that makes Muse extremely fascinating to watch. Tom Hanks delivers a masterful performance that has to be the actor's best since \\"Road to Perdition.\\" Captain Richard Phillips is obviously scared out of his mind the majority of the film, but he never stops looking for a way to slow his enemies down. His brain is always ticking away searching for a way to escape. You'll hold your breath and your heart will skip beats in the final 15-20 nerve-racking minutes of \\"Captain Phillips.\\" Hanks' performance is completely disheartening and quite astounding.<br /><br />While the film is mostly very good, there are stretches during its 134-minute duration that drag and feel longer than they probably should. \\"Captain Phillips\\" is more or less a hostage crisis that spans over two hours, so there's bound to be a little downtime. However, once the pirates turn up it seems as though the formula of the film results to the pirates making absurd demands and Phillips attempting to thwart them before succumbing to whatever they were asking for to begin with. Then it starts all over again while you watch Phillips try to overcome an even stickier situation. Rinse and repeat several times before the big climax. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it was more of a simple premise with a spectacular execution.<br /><br />\\"Captain Phillips\\" is an action thriller filled with intense, chaotic, mayhem, absolute pandemonium, and nefariously determined villains. Tom Hanks reminds everyone why he's still one of the most talented actors still working today while Paul Greengrass adds yet another expertly woven and riveting adventure to his already action packed resume.e why he's still one of the most talented actors still working today while Paul Greengrass adds yet another expertly woven and riveting adventure to his already action packed resume.
0765316978|5.0|Story is same one as in &#34;Zoe's Tale&#34; but from different point of view, an almost ninety year old man vs. a fifteen year old girl.  Book itself hard to find in hard cover, good price, great condition and arrived earlier than expected.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have no other possible way to describe pintrest other than highly addicting. You will be inspired and more than likely hooked immediately.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Leaving the first Part which is full of philosophical stuff, I would say it's a great read. Inspirational and outstanding, it shows the few unknown a world of Nicolas Tesla. So worth it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved them all. Cannot wait for the movie. Charlie Hunnam will make an awesome Christian. This is a wonderful love story.
B00457X7IQ|5.0|wow this has so much courage love and drama along with suspense and fear it really takes you to the story you really feel like youre there
B0079J28NC|5.0|I used to watch this as a kid on local TV stations. Friends would gather at and we just had a blast watching this (sometimes on a small B & W TV!). Well, the restoration and sound remix on this DVD is excellent and it was great to introduce and watch w/my son. He loves it too.
B004J713JW|5.0|This is just an incredible performance.  The disc's picture and audio quality are impeccable. Billy Joel sings as well as he did 30 years ago.  Definitely a must have in your home theater collection.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Wonderful feel good movie.<br />First saw it on TV (with commercial interruptions) and managed to enjoy it so<br />much that we wanted to add it to our collection and watch it straight through.<br />Have watched our own copy twice since then, and still love it.<br />Great movie!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|great CD - this CD is so good and &#34;vintage&#34; Elton John - the lyrics and music are GREAT!  Buy this CD!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Funny game and addicting. Can get challenging to level up. Plenty of opportunities to spend money so watch children playing.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|An amusing story, fun for those who enjoy 20th century history, and inventive in weaving together so many disparate historical events and figures. But even so, not  a great story. Not a book I would recommend except as a lark.
B001V5ADS2|5.0|I LOVE this show.  Not only because I spent 20 years in Albuquerque, but because this show is just awesome. It is, without a doubt, my favorite TV series of all time.  I love watching this with my wife and seeing who can recognize local landmarks and locations first!  So fun to do.  The only hope I have is that Breaking Bad just may be able to educate the rest of the eastern and southern United States to the fact that New Mexico is a STATE in the United States.  It sickens me when I travel to places like Arkansas, Missouri, Florida, etc, and find that people in this country, in this day and age, that still don't know this.  WE ARE NOT MEXICO.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I would have rated this higher a few days ago when it was actually working. Now all it does is load and nothing comes up because then it freezes. Please fix it! I have uninstalled it several times but it just does the same thing. :(

B004ZMXTRA|4.0|This film was much better than I expected. The trailer doesn't do it justice. My Nephew just stared High School drumline, and we watched it together. It was a good time.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|IF YOU WANT AN ANIME THATS JUST SILLY AND FUN JUST BUY THIS I PROMISE YOU WONT REGRET IT AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU MIGHT WANT TO COVER THEIR EYES FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT GO ON IN THIS ANIME AND ALL THE WOMEN ARE REALLY HOT LOL SO THATS A DECENT SELLING POINT<br /><br />GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|This game is BO-RING! Same objects, level after level. Even with the different types of gameplay, it gets old fast. There is no zoom feature, so good luck using it on a smaller phone. I have the DNA (5&quot; display) and near perfect vision and I had trouble seeing some of the items. Additionally, the objects are on pedestals on the bottom of the screen. This blocks the view of items in the lower portion of the scene. The menus are not well thought out. The whole game is a bust. I'm very glad I didn't pay for this one, and I certainly won't be looking to  purchase any other versions. Skip this FAOTD and treat yourself to a paid app.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this gave.  Simple, yet includes great ongoing challenges that you keep striving to accomplish.  I can't put it down!

B0064MGU98|5.0|Getting to know the work, philosophy of lawyers from this series is interesting.<br />I also like the aspect of emotion among people: colleagues, husband and wife, mother and children...<br />It is quite sad to see Gary changing his side.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Good book.<br />Entertaining and suspenseful.<br />You never want to put the book down.<br /> I would recommend it to a friend.
1885167776|5.0|Great product at a great price. They were as described and I am very happy with the condition. Recommend to anyone.
B0013O123Q|3.0|It is very disturbing movie. Message about sexual violence and violence in genereal did not come accross in best possible manner. Idea of presenting events backwards was stolen from Memento. The whole movie gave me a creepy  feeling . IMO director is very talented but seriously disturbed ...
0316172324|5.0|I am very very happy with this book. I have been looking for this book for quite some time and finally found it! Great price and seller! A++++++++
B0011UBDTK|3.0|The DVD book came quickly and was is pristine condition. There were only a couple of DVDs that were too scratched the watch. The rest worked fine.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Mr. Russinovich definitely has some awesome writing skills, and this novel shows it.  It has the same kind of character and technical depth that I would expect from, say, a Dan Brown novel, and keeps me every bit as riveted.  Mark has woven the storyline together with such smoothness that with each revelation I became more and more excited to see how it all ended.  I've read Mark's other 'internals' books over the years and have admired his technical skills for a long, long time, but now I see that he is an amazing novelist as well.  This was truly a great read from a brilliant man.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very entertaining to watch. Drama at its finest.  Whether you like lawyers or not, it is fun to watch them go after each other.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat isn't what it used to be. It has been so changed through deliberate mutation and breeding that yields have doubled. Unfortunately, the new wheat has new proteins that are causing the incidence of obesity and diabetes to skyrocket. These new proteins also turn out to be similar to opiates and can be addictive. Dr. Davis says that food manufacturers are aware that adding wheat to their products can cause their customers to eat more and crave their products.<br /><br />Dr. Davis makes a compelling and well documented case for eliminating wheat from our diets. It was not an easy concept for me to accept, even though I had all but eliminated wheat from my diet already. Dr. Davis' message flies in the face of all that we have been told about eating \\"healthy whole grains\\" all these years. But, for someone with diabetes, or a pad of gut fat that stubbornly remains after diets and exercise, Dr. Davis offers some real hope.<br /><br />Dr. Davis with a humorous and easily readable style that makes the book as engaging as a mystery novel. It is an enjoyable, if unsettling read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Delivered on time good morels and values that kids need to learn what really is important in life. Highly recommend this read for students and even adults!
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|it records but playback is low volume. Maybe it was my shy subject. Seven more words are required so here they are.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Excellent cable. works grate  it is made for the Kindle. they got it to me very fast .i will buy this cable again. the grandkids tend to loose them..
B007P2DQJI|5.0|This is a perfect match for the Samsung Google Nexus cell phone. Bought this as a spare to replace a cheaper one from another vendor that failed after being recharged a dozen times or more. Very satisfied.  Recommended.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is very funny and fun. You have to try and and save the little guys from their &quot;dumb ways to die&quot;. And if you get 800 points you unlock the free music video that is hilarious!!! I recommend this game to everyone, everywhere, everyday, and every time. I hope you get this hilarious game and watch the music video a lot. There is also an option for turning off the plane game, which requires you to blow into the part of the Kindle where you plug in your headphones. Get this game! PEACE OUT!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Been playing for a day or so with this game and I like it.  Could use a little better tutorial, but I am getting the hang of it.
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|The Amazon Appstore paid free app of the day for October 12, 2013 is XnRetro Pro from XnView.<br /><br />This is a nice image editing tool app used to change the colors of an existing photo or image to give it a fancy black and white effect or a different type of colors effect.  You can even crop the photo or image before you change the colors if you only want to give part of your image a different effect.  There are also different borders to add around the edges of your images to make the image look like a photo or part of a filmstrip.<br /><br />I am deducting one star because while the images on the Amazon page are nice examples of what you can use this app for, those images would have been more useful with a BEFORE image of the same image instead of just the AFTER effect images.  And a video on the Amazon page describing how the app works would have been very helpful too since the app lacks any in depth documentation.<br /><br />I am deducting a second star since this app lacks an UNDO feature as far as I can tell and you should expect these type of apps to have an UNDO feature as a standard feature since people often accidentally press the wrong button or change their minds after applying one too many changes.<br /><br />The price at $1.32 doesn't seem very Amazon Coin friendly since it would cost about 132 coins leaving you with about 50 coins left over if you have 200 coins to spend, but I am not going to deduct a star for that.  I am just suggesting that the app maker might want to change their app price to be more Amazon Coin friendly.<br /><br />Therefore I am giving XnRetro Pro a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Ok. I love this one more than the 1st one or the Disney brave versions.  Like the original it has the beloved characters the monsters are even more terrifying.  I love that you have weekly and daily challenges. I also love the mines and wooden bridges.  But I am also a fan of the series in general.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Iron man 3 is an Awesome movie. It has Lots of action and a great story line. A definite must see!

B001HN6EF4|5.0|The waterproof cards worked great on our vacation at a beach house. The cards withstood the abuse of our kids and didn't get ruined by the water and sand.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I could read this over and over again!  Its timeless and a classic and a must read for everyone!  My own daughter read it for school and she highly recommended it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game alot of fun and a good time consumers really gets your brain working haha i had a blast
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Starts out as a love story that ends tragic. William Wallace is a true folk hero. Mel Gibson's best performance to me.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Pretty good.  Great effects, and a more serious version than the original (which I preferred - others might not).  NOt the best Sci Fi movie that I have watched this year, but still enjoyable.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|This to me is the all time greatest horror story produced. Still sends chills as it did when it opened. I can remember when they staged ambulances outside theatres years ago. I usually watch it with the lights on. lol
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It is a great combination of hidden object and puzzle solving. Add in a little strategy about when to do which one and it ends up being a really good game.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I play puzzle mode almost every day over and over for hours! Its so much fun, never gets boring! Best game ever!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Not a bunch of mumbo jumbo...he speaks realistically. This book just makes so much sense!! He has a great desire to see people be happily married.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This game has many playing options. I think I will be playing this one over and over many many times. I even played the kids version, that was a lot of fun too.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|I still love the White Stripes but this is Jack White's best work to date. Blunderbuss is a must own for any fan of Jack White.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It had a great plot and kept your attention throughout the book.  Best Forsyth book in years.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I can understand why this book might not enthrall all of its readers but for me, it was brilliant. The anthropological framework certainly entertained me and the deeper themes hooked me.<br />The concept of a Speaker for the Dead and the healing properties of truth make the book a self-searching read. Perhaps the book does not glorify the catholic concept of confession, but it certainly values repentance and forgiveness while acknowledging the absurdity of the act of forgiveness. Above all, it reminds readers of our common humanity and urges each to pursue peace through understanding.<br /><br />&#34;When you really know somebody, you can't hate them...Or maybe it's just that you can't really know them until you stop hating them...Once you understand what people really want, you can't hate them anymore. You can fear them, but you can't hate them, because you can always find the same desires in your own heart.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;...she felt strangely healed, as if simply speaking her mistake were enough to purge some of the pain of it. For the first time, then, she caught a glimpse of what the power of speaking might be. It wasn't a matter of confession, penance, and absolution, like the priests offered. I was something else entirely. Telling the story of who she was, and then realizing that she was no longer the same person. That she had made a mistake, and the mistake had changed her, and now she would not make the mistake again because she had become someone else, someone less afraid, someone more compassionate.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Sickness and healing are in every heart. Death and deliverance are in every hand.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;How suddenly we find the flesh of God within us after all, when we thought that we were only made of dust.&#34;
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I really like the idea of the story were people go into sameness I think it's original in rid own way. I loved this book. Keep  wrighting :)

B00ETPLQC8|5.0|This is what I have expected from the Death Magnetic album, I don't know why these four tracks was not included in the DM album ?<br /><br />I prefer Metallica to write and perform this type of music than the St. Anger and Death Magnetic album.<br /><br />Thanks to the 'tallica boys for releasing this EP, this is what the Metal music should sound \m/
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This is a very easy and simple way to keep track with your eBay account. Bids purchases and past purchases all show up easily. Just like the full size pc version you can have notices sent to your email daily for bids and added items. Great app you will enjoy this if you like eBay.<br />Terry
B007W4OZ76|5.0|This program exceeds all my expectations. Works flawlessly with Dropbox which I use extensively. And the main reason I tried out this software. Thanks for making this program.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|A measure of the power of this book is that it made me stop and think if I should even write this review online (using my real name!), give it stars, check out my reviewer rank, helpful and not helpful ratio and so on. And this I think is the kind of thing Eggers wanted. Its timeliness is also remarkable- I had just deleted my Facebook account (with great relief) a few weeks before publication of The Circle.<br /><br />I suspect that the author self-consciously wanted to continue along the lines of the classic dystopian novel, notably Orwell's 1984 and the book that inspired 1984, Zamyatin's We (Russia, early 20's). Thus, the book, while obviously taking from these works, cannot be called derivative. To the contrary, the strong resemblances point out that totalitarianism is an ever-present menace, regardless of time or place. The continuity of the threat, at various times and in very different societies, is emphasized; in particular, the fact that the totalitarian seed is very hard to recognize when it is in your own society, and when that society masks its power hunger under the guise of revolutionary newness and salvation for all.<br /><br />As a work of fiction, I found it very accessible, practically a page-turner (or screen flipper, actually).Especially effective was the contrast between the supposedly ideal campus of The Circle and the outside world, which the protagonist Mae disdainfully thinks of as a Third World to be left behind. Whereas the scenes with her family and ex-boyfriend, and of her kayaking alone, are the only real and appealing parts of her life. With this, Eggers shows that the almost irresistible attraction of the virtual world is that it seems to banish things like failed relationships with an imperfect partner or the aging and chronic disease of her parents. This is of course impossible. In other words, the need for a virtual world is a religious need- in glaring contrast to the claims of pure rationality and logic of the technocrats.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|it is the most horrible game ever if you like it you are a a bumb but never get this game it sucks
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Great actors, but what a waste of money!!!!<br />Morgan Freeman, Mark Rufalo, and all the others actor... really too bad.
B00E8G5HDW|4.0|I'm a little depressed that as for now this looks like the final season of this entertaining series and with a decent cliff hanger too, also it was tragic that many fans of the show know we lost a talented actor Ian Abercrombie who was the voice of Chancellor Palpatine. Some people feel the CGI animation is to childish to be taken seriously but I disagree,while not the realistic CGI version we've seen with the PC Games of Star Wars:The Old Republic the animation for the series was good and the action and story was also entertaining throughout the shows run.<br /><br />Hopefully with Disney getting the rights to Star Wars we may see a continuation of the series later on though I do hope they keep it at the same level of drama and action instead of truly making it a kids series.  Still for fans of the series or just those looking fora good show here's one to try out just a suggestion for newcomers though, get the first season as some of the show's storylines will confuse on what's happening with the main story and with the characters as well.
B002F3BP8Q|5.0|LOVE (Expanded) is most excellent. If you don't have RARE CULT or don't want to wear out your vinyl EPs it's worth the purchase for the excellent leftovers from the Sanctuary single sessions and album sessions tracks that were to become the B-sides.<br /><br />The Omnibus edition is a MUST HAVE - it has the demos, which are nice to listen to, but the best is the live album, which also has 3 DREAMTIME tracks on it - and even one Death Cult track.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002GU605G Love Omnibus Edition The Cult]]
1936608898|5.0|I am halfway through my first whole30 month and I'm feeling terrific. I was a slave to diets, and between diets was addicted to Diet Coke, junk food and sugar. This book introduced me to a whole new style of eating and thinking about food. It has now been 2 weeks since I have had a Diet Coke, and I used to drink at least a 6 pack a day. I never thought I would ever be able to kick it, but it's getting easier and easier.<br /><br />The book is well laid out, informative and motivating. At first I thought there was no way I would be able to manage giving up so much. But with some careful planning, it's not as tough as you might think! You're talking to a junk food junkie here! I'm not someone who was already eating healthy and had to cut out a few extra things. I'm someone who was eating badly and feeling like crap who had to completely revamp my diet. And I'm doing it. I'm surviving. And guess what - I am actually enjoying the delicious food I've been eating!<br /><br />I'm also starting to notice positive changes in my skin, I've lost 5 pounds, and my stomach problems are starting to go away. And this is just after 2 weeks!<br /><br />Give it a shot. You can do anything for 30 days.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|You gotta get this JUST for The Ocean! One of their greatest licks ever - and one of the greatest licks in all of rock ever! Excellent live versions of Black Dog, Misty Mountain Hop. Zep at their best? Very possible. Must've been something about the early 1970s.

B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Awesome release for those that want what was to become ELECTRIC (previously released as THE MANOR SESSIONS but only as a 5 track EP). Wild Flower is considerably different. LRM has elements of several songs in it, including a guitar run that would later be used in Sun King. Aphrodisiac Jacket and Zap City, The Cult's greatest song ever, are by far the best tracks on PEACE.<br /><br />Oh and Love Trooper and Conquistador as well.

1591396190|4.0|Below are key excerpts that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- &#34;Blue oceans, in contrast, are defined by untapped market space, demand creation, and the opportunity for highly profitable growth. Although some blue oceans are created well beyond existing industry boundaries, most are created from within red oceans by expanding existing industry boundaries, as Cirque du Soleil did. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set.&#34;<br /><br />2- &#34;However, there is little practical guidance on how to create them. Without analytic frameworks to create blue oceans and principles to effectively manage risk, creating blue oceans has remained wishful thinking that is seen as too risky for managers to pursue as strategy. This book provides practical frameworks and analytics for the systematic pursuit and capture of blue oceans.&#34;<br /><br />3- &#34;Consistent with this observation, our study shows that the strategic move, and not the company or the industry, is the right unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans and sustained high performance. A strategic move is the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering.&#34;<br /><br />4- &#34;The creators of blue oceans, surprisingly, didn't use the competition as their benchmark. Instead, they followed a different strategic logic that we call value innovation. Value innovation is the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. We call it value innovation because instead of focusing on beating the competition, you focus on making the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for buyers and your company, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space.&#34;<br /><br />5- &#34;To fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of an industry, you must begin by reorienting your strategic focus from competitors to alternatives, and from customers to noncustomers of the industry.^ To pursue both value and cost, you should resist the old logic of benchmarking competitors in the existing field and choosing between differentiation and cost leadership.&#34;<br /><br />6- &#34;To reconstruct buyer value elements in crafting a new value curve, we have developed the four actions framework...Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated! Which factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard? Which factors should be raised well above the industry's standard? Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?&#34;<br /><br />7- &#34;The first principle of blue ocean strategy is to reconstruct market boundaries to break from the competition and create blue oceans...Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries...Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups Within Industries...Path 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers...Path 4: Look Across Complementary Product and Service Offerings...Path 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal to Buyers...Path 6: Look Across Time.&#34;<br /><br />8- &#34;To maximize the size of their blue oceans, companies need to take a reverse course. Instead of concentrating on customers, they need to look to noncustomers. And instead of focusing on customer differences, they need to build on powerful commonalities in what buyers value. That allows companies to reach beyond existing demand to unlock a new mass of customers that did not exist before.&#34;<br /><br />9- &#34;Companies need to build their blue ocean strategy in the sequence of buyer utility, price, cost, and adoption.&#34;<br /><br />10- &#34;Companies, like individuals, often have a tough time translating thought into action whether in red or blue oceans. But compared with red ocean strategy, blue ocean strategy represents a significant departure from the status quo. It hinges on a shift from convergence to divergence in value curves at lower costs. That raises the execution bar. Managers have assured us that the challenge is steep. They face four hurdles. One is cognitive: waking employees up to the need for a strategic shift. Red oceans may not be the paths to future profitable growth, but they feel comfortable to people and may have even served an organization well until now, so why rock the boat? The second hurdle is limited resources. The greater the shift in strategy, the greater it is assumed are the resources needed to execute it. But resources were being cut, and not raised, in many of the organizations we studied. Third is motivation. How do you motivate key players to move fast and tenaciously to carry out a break from the status quo? That will take years, and managers don't have that kind of time. The final hurdle is politics. As one manager put it, &#34;In our organization you get shot down before you stand up.&#34;&#34;<br /><br />11- &#34;Key to winning over your detractors or devils is knowing all their likely angles of attack and building up counterarguments backed by irrefutable facts and reason.&#34;<br /><br />12- &#34;To change the mass it focuses on transforming the extremes: the people, acts, and activities that exercise a disproportionate influence on performance. By transforming the extremes, tipping point leaders are able to change the core fast and at low cost to execute their new strategy.&#34;<br /><br />13- &#34;Because blue and red oceans have always coexisted however, practical reality demands that companies succeed in both oceans and master the strategies for both. But because companies already understand how to compete in red oceans, what they need to 1 learn is how to make the competition irrelevant. This book aims too help balance the scales so that formulating and executing blue ocean strategy can become as systematic and actionable as competing in the red oceans of known market space.&#34;teep.

B00F9040HU|5.0|The best game I have played recently.  The Quest for Atlantis takes you through the countries of Greece and Troy, just to name a couple because there are many other countries surrounding Greece that are involved in this match 3 game.  Each time you play, there are different items within the puzzle that must be dropped down to the bottom of the puzzle, and are then collected, thus a new puzzle is formed where the other pieces have their chance to be collected.  Finally, after all pieces are collected, the game continues on with other levels.  A very interesting and challenging game.

Almost every page has something that you can use to enhance your life. If you are able to absorb 20% of this book you'll be more interesting than 80% of the people you know.

Reading this book will turn what you know upside down and have a positive impact on your life. It's very well written and you'll fly through it in little time.

B00E89VXQY|5.0|What could be better than a 3D up close and personal concert experience with Metallica? An up close and personal concert experience with 'old school thrash metal' Metallica and some weird, apocalyptic fantasy thrown in just for kicks! I loved the movie---it was hands down the best Metallica concert I've ever seen. The band was in top form and whooping butt; the likes of which hasn't been seen since the bands' grungy, sort of ratty hair days---that was said with the utmost respect, fellas. I think their choice of music was brilliant and added just the right amount of nostalgia to a modern day movie. If you haven't seen the movie then do yourself a favor and go. In the meantime, listen to this disc which will be a feast for the ears, and bask in the glory days of thrash presented with perfection by the band who gave rise to a sub-genre of heavy metal which will influence metal music for decades to come.
B0090P0O70|5.0|The symbolism, historical allusions, and literary expertise is all here. I loved reading the book cover to cover. Word. Word.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Comparing all of the Vietnam war movies, I like this one the best. Lee Emery is at his best as the drill instructor. The film is based on the novel by Gustav Hasford and is at least partially true.<br /><br />[...]

B008ROGZUU|5.0|Between the unique Tosca of Gheorghiu and the ferocity of Terfel's Scarpia, plus the luminosity of Kaufmann, this is indeed a different experience.  The tension never lets up and the visceral intensity makes this a most compelling drama.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Top notch!  Good balance between HO games and logic puzzles.  Well worth the price.  I look forward to the next game from the people at G5.
B00BAXFDLM|4.0|3-1/2 stars. This book had me so confused in the beginning. Breq talks about everyone as a she or as being unable to discern their sex by their appearance. Then someone would specifically say a person is a he, and Breq would call that same person a she. Then in her memories everyone is described as female. Super confusing. Then Breq remembers being near her superior, at the same time she's in an alley, at the same time she's standing guard somewhere. What in the heck?! I finally figure out she was part of a (view spoiler), but it took me awhile to figure that out.<br /><br />I will tell you that if I weren't reviewing this for Netgalley, I would have have given up. However, finally at page 90 the book started becoming more interesting and it just built and built until I couldn't put it down. I'm afraid that all of the confusion and there being no explanation about why everyone is a she and how Breq could be a 10 places at the same time would have other readers moving on to another book, which would be a mistake. I don't know if there's a way to add an prologue with a brief explanation, but I think that would work wonders for this book.<br /><br />I would have given this book 4-1/2 stars if not for the beginning.
B0001WGDX0|5.0|great to listen to while states of ennui exist: car; can't sleep; listless; ready to meditate and go to sleep.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I knew this would be a good movie that I could watch with my mom who loved Brad Pitt in everything else (we live in Montana, duh A River Runs Thru It etc). But one lonely night I rented this movie & realized immediately that I had seen it already drunkenly. I LOVE the female lead, I watched all \\"The Killing\\"s available, love her. Pitt at age 50? No problem. No over-sentimentality, just what would happen which is why I live on the top floor of my industrial building with nails & spare furniture, but I should have kept my Top Ramen (I donated it to homeless shelter, where it will begin.)
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Worth getting to have the songs, though Bruno is everywhere right now.  Some day he won't be though.  Good quality

B000002GVO|3.0|If you're missing some of the Eagles classic songs and don't use Spotify or other service, this would be an ok purchase.  Not a lot of extra material with the package.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics.  So cute!!  The noises are adorable! I love it.  The characters are just like the ones in the movies!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Good quality CD with some terrific songs on it.  Bruno's hot now and won't be forever, but this is a keeper.

B00957T6X6|4.0|I was a little disappointed in the book at first. It does not have the same impact as the first four books and jumps around too much. Martin has created a vast landscape with innumerable important characters and many more lesser important characters important to the flow of the Game of Thrones. This book moves too abruptly between places events and characters for me. It loses a little of the buildup contained in the other four. Still it is Martin and his saga. I really hope he finishes his saga soon. Too much of a great thing spoils the climax.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so cool I play it all the time I sew the move<br />I thing this game is the best I have a of despicable me toys and games
B00F35BV64|4.0|Let's face it, we don't watch Star Trek for the story line! The graphics we spectacular, the dialog campy fun. If you are a Star Trek fan this was worth the time and investment.
B00873GRU4|5.0|A very unique take on survival with characters you come to care about so much you can't put the book down.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|As a lover of the book, I found this movie quite boring. Dicaprio gave a spirited performance but I thought McGuire was in over his head.  For pure enjoyment this movie was a disappointment .

B0087EVHTE|4.0|This installed easy and is working great and seem like a sweet spot for performance and money spent.  I put it in a new MB (AS Rock LGA 1155) to upgrade my old system.  The only thing still slow are my older hard drives (time to switch to SSD ones I guess).  :)
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Thank god we got to see the correct film interpretation of the Dredd character. Must see if you love Dredd and dig some good actions scenes and that unmistakable Dredd like dialogue.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|The quality is fine as is the sound.  My favorite part is seeing all of the little scratches on metal pieces and other details in the movie that are brought out with Blueray that I could never see with the ordinary DVD resolution.  It is hard to believe that the movie is so old when it looks this good.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I JUST GOT MY HUNDRETH DRAGON AND THEN IT UPDATED AND I LOST EVERY THING IF AMOZON READS THESE THINGS PLEASE FIX IT Other wise it's a good game
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I figured for the price, the Chromecast device was worth a shot.  It is significantly less expensive than any of the other popular streaming units out there (Roku, Apple TV, etc.).  I will say that for the content that it is designed, the picture is great - Netflix, Hulu, Google, Play, Youtube. While it doesn't surprise me, I wish amazon video was supported. For any non-chromecast supported content, the image is great, but I have found that the audio lags. I tried TBS's streaming channel, and it looked great on the cast, but as the content went on, the audio lagged farther and farther behind.<br />Setup is a snap - you plug it in to your HDMI slot on your video device, register your unit and connect it to your wireless network.  Chrome has a plugin that allows you to cast any content from your desktop, laptop, mobile device, etc. It's pretty awesome as it is, but it would be super awesome if they somehow snuck in an OTA digital receiver.  My guess is that they didn't want to mess around with antennae.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great price point<br />Easy setup<br />Video and audio quality is superb for applications that are paired with chromecast<br />Compact and unobtrusive<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs more content available (probably to be increased in the future)<br />Non-chromecast content quality is sketchy.<br /><br />Overall worth the investment if you have a nice TV or projector and you want to watch your Netflix, Hulu or Google Play  streaming content  on your home theater setup.
B00992CF6W|2.0|i have never played game before and can't find out what my objective is or how to play.  Blahhh blahhh
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much. Nice story and good acting. I will watch it again. Not a Hollywood extravaganza which I tend to not enjoy as much as a good story.
0374533555|4.0|I like books this author writes which got me interested in buying it. Also i love how the brain works in mysterious ways. Easy and good read. Also shipped in time and in perfect condition.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I had seen the play and did not know what to expect in a movie because usually they are not as good. This was so well done and i enjoyed it very much and will watch it many times I am sure. Hollywood did a good job with this one.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I really like this game it's a game I can play with my daughter.  The missions are challenging, but fun.  The graphics are great on my HD kindle.

B009RH9HDS|4.0|This is a nice case that I'm sure will last the life of my Kindle HD.  I like the swivel feature; it makes it easy to use when I want to follow a recipe while cooking. The only negative I find is the \\"handle\\" that you should be able to slide you hand into for holding on while reading.  It is actually awkward to do so and I find it impossible to comfortably use.  Otherwise it's a great cover that protects my kindle.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|FASRDPS please add me.  daily player. love playing this game. just need neighbors to play. has good missions to play to make money
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|I don't know who wrote all of those glowing five star reviews...But it wasn't anyone that's played many really good &quot;hidden&quot; games. In my opinion, this was little more than a basic photo with lots of small items photoshopped on top. There was no integration of the items to make them look like part of the picture, and the only thing that made the search difficult at all was the sheer numbers of the items to choose from. Do you know what a &quot;guan&quot; is? I didn't either. A quick Bing search said it was a Chinese flute. I could find nothing similar in the photo. Back to Bing...to find out that it's a species of bird. Since I have to do enough research in my day job, I find it irritating to have had to do it to play a game. I have bought a lot of supposedly hidden mystery games that are in this same format of simply placing myriad items on a background, and apparently they do have followers. For that reason I would give this three stars. But, I'm taking away another star to make up for the reviews that I believe we're less than honest to sort of even the score. Two stars. And it is deleted from my tablet.

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The best horror show made for television that I have seen in a long time. I love it!! I am definitely a fan
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars' sound stretches different musical genres and that explains his cross-over appeal!<br /><br />P.S. We went to his concert at the Staples Center last summer. The guy has the pipes, he has the moves and then he showed us all how he can play the guitar (lead and acoustic), the piano, the drums, etc. Just a true talent!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Amazingly, the ongoing series of Star Trek scripts still catches the attention of everyone. Some look at the mechanical aspects and wonder if they will be in our hands in the next decade. Considering the I-Pad and Smartphone makes me wonder if someone is inventing those rascally Tribbles! Others appreciate the global inclusion of other cultures -- even alien cultures. Still others enjoy the invented languages, or the fashions, or the unpredictable plots that bring back the dead, rescue the whales, or have to put up with Q.<br />I love Trek because it takes me to new frontiers where I shall probably never live long enough to go.<br />BJ, Florida

B0012GTZC0|5.0|Ken Follett is a master storyteller.  Each book he writes is so different.  I love all the ins and outs of his characters and what they think and how they react to life events.  This book has a wonderful ending that I didn't see coming.  Totally riveting until the final page.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Season 8 is awesome Love this show, it is so great to keep up with  the story... Can't wait to see what is up for them next Like the Wedding and then the honeymoon.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A small cast of characters invites you into their lives in rural Ireland.  The characters are well developed.  Dialogue is realistic.  It is best to enjoy the Irish language rather than scorn it.  The story has a twist which is revealed in the final pages.  This book made me laugh and cry.  I will read more books by McKenna.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|When I started the game I thought that it would be fun but then I got stuck and can't seem to get much help from the hints. Guess I'm just not smart enough.

0316322407|5.0|I downloaded this book to my phone and read it in less than 48 hours! It's truly an amazing story of a young girl whose father is years ahead of his time in terms of women's equality and doesn't even know it. He instills in young Malala a love of learning, a respect for all humans, and a sense of bravery and determination, even in the face of adversity. Most ofus will never understand the adversity this girl has been through.<br /><br />Malala, generally, has a happy childhood until the Taliban set up shop in her beloved Swat Valley. Gradually, they poison everything they touch and things become restrictive, oppressive and violent.... very quickly.  Malala's persistence and strength is illustrated through-out the book. You will cheer this young woman on with every turn of the page! Great, great book!

034580404X|4.0|I have not had time to finish reading them but so far fantastic is what think! Very highly recomended. If you haven't read it you need to.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Full of suspense, good story line with the plot well thought out, authentic, well-researched, keeps the reader engaged, definitely a page-turner
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very nice set. Bought for cheaper than just one of the movies separately. Worth every penny. Gotham needs a hero.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I'm really upset of Logitech products and wasted my money on this headset and G700 Wireless Mouse, I think Logitech products suffer of wireless technology, my headset keeps cutting every minute making me crazy, I tried every possible thing to do but with no luck till I ended throwing it in garbage, after while I noticed that my mouse is facing the same issue, while in gaming if I hold on pressing the right click it releases by itself.<br /><br />No more Logitech for me. Now I'm happy with my Creative Tactic Wireless Headset, and it never breaks, it's just not that comfy but I can work around that, but quality wise, really best wireless headset.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|Do you believe in fate?  A read full of interesting twists and turns and for those that believe in fate and romance this will delight....
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Didn't care for this book.  Too many characters and time frames to remember.  Not a very good book club book.
1465414444|5.0|I have been playing WOW for 7 years.  I have always had a fascination with the artwork. I bought two of these books.  One to seal up to put in my book collection and one to look at.  I would love to take this book to Blizzard and have the artists sign it.
B00AYB0YFQ|3.0|Here we have a moderately funny send-up on the teen slasher movies of the 1980s, that makes fun of all the cliches to fairly good effect. I have some reservations about their portrayal of gay people, but will give the benefit of the doubt and assume no malice is intended.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|It was nice to read by choice something I was forced to read as a kid (I really hate that).  It's much more exciting than I remember, although it does lag in places, just as I remembered.  I loved the excitement and plot twists more than then.<br />It's definitely worth a read, even if it is for the second time.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Enjoyable and simple game to play. I just started so I am not sure how difficult it will be to advance without spending real money but will find out.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've  always loved the super scribblenauts series.I mean who doesn't like a game where you're able to make your own ways to beat a level? It's awesome that these s has finally made it onto a tablet.yeah it's the exact same as the day version,but it's still seriously fun!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game has great challenges and great adventure. Story line could add more but okay for a I spy game.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Dont waste your money.  This thing cant even mirror from smart phones or tablets. Get a roku 3. more money but well worth it
B0000AI45P|5.0|Every year I still pull this CD out and am blown away once again by how incendiary the music is.  The most remarkable thing to me is that it's not easy to pinpoint exactly what makes this music so epic and timeless, but there's never any doubt that it is.  Of course, there's the still unparalleled interwoven guitar chemistry of Verlaine and Lloyd.  There's the bold, but tasteful rhythm section of Ficca and Smith. You've got the mysterious and poetic lyrics of Verlaine.  And there's the songs themselves, that all work individually, but create something even more than the proverbial sum of their parts as a whole.  Even still, it all doesn't have to add up to such greatness, it just does.  It's almost a certainty that if something has intrigued you to investigate this album, you will find more than you were hoping for.  The bonus tracks are as vital as the core album, even though three of them are merely alternative takes of three of it's most remarkable songs.  As highly recommendable as anything I've ever heard.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a well-written series, which I have followed from the beginning. Without dropping any spoilers, Season 3 is wonderful and devastating, and I am eagerly awaiting Season 4.
B0053HR2LK|5.0|I don't have a cassette player anymore, I haven't for years now. I can listen to this again....so many memories of the good old days. I miss having a real Winter in northern MN.
1568490119|5.0|This author endured most all degrading things possible, and made them fuel for his quite successful and meaningful life. It is also available to each of us.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great movie,  fun for the kids ( ages 2.5  and 5) but entertaining  enough for adults too. Happy  with our purchase.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great shows love the beautiful girls and bikes. Great action and wished I had a mc to protect my town!!!!
B005HEPN06|4.0|Star Trek TNG was always my favorite show from the spinoffs.<br />Interestingly, the series finale is way better than the last j.j. Abrams Star Trek movie.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Cute computer graphics, lots of fun and a good lesson in satety.  Nicely presented and good for the entire family.
B001HADE00|5.0|I was 13 yrs old when this album came out and it was an album that opened my eyes to new music.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this band is FAR more than another crap, all show, hair band.  These guys were the real deal!  This album changed the music scene in the mid-eighties.  A whole lot of junk came out in the eighties.  Most of those bands were unsuccessfully trying to be the next RATT. Unfortunately, some great bands, like Ratt have paid the price for other bands that turned the scene into a silly cartoon of what metal really was and is.  Ratt was one of the really good bands that history has lumped in with the over-the-top antics, make-up, hair spray and s***ty music of lesser bands of the era.  Ratt was a GREAT band, and in my opinion, this is their best album.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|The bright color makes it easy to find when I'm looking for it.  I like the shut-off feature when I close the cover.  The stand-up feature makes it easy to watch videos.  I really like it.  Thanks, Amazon!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|UPDATE NEEDED!<br />I have a Kindle fire latest version but the app it self does not work what so ever no search results for friend search everything is completely broken totally frustrating for some one who barely using the app! Makes me want to delete it entirely! Please update n fix this asap! Plus getting the annoying Google plus update as well!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I bought this for my son about a year ago I think, I am sorry I am a little behind in my reviews. But it was great the movie is great plays great and we love it!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The book's blurb claims \\"sophisticated world-building and characterization\\".  This is a false claim.<br />  The characters are almost rote stereotypes; hero, hero's friend, enigmatic wizard, good king, bad Prince.  \\"Game Of Thrones\\" is just one example of a story with the same rote characters, but depicted exponentially more sophisticated.<br />  I understand TGOT is written for more mature audience, but...<br />  The major problem I have is that I'm told a lot that we're not shown: the king is good and wise, the people are happy, content, prosperous.  Yet, the world we're shown is very strictly hierarchical where ....Spoiler..................you have to haul a cart of hay to the capital to get a good price, and then threaten someone with the stockades when they hitch a ride.<br /><br />Finally, I still don't know what the story is.  Harry Potter had to beat Voldemort, other stories change broken societies.  If the author is to be believed, this society is working. I guess if you like Horatio Alger in fantasyland keep reading, I don't think I can.
0792839749|5.0|I bought this for my husband as a Christmas Gift. And he loved it so much, it brought back a lot of child hood memories for him!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is amazing! The gameplay is unbelievable! But there's one thing to this that legitimately makes the whole game run itself how it does:<br /><br />When they say the only limit is your imagination, they really mean it.<br /><br />As for an example, I once made a Edible Nuke and a Hungry Nuke, and the Hungry Nuke consumed the edible one. If your imagination is practically endless (such as mine), then while you play you are never bound by limits.<br /><br />If you're someone who usually just goes for the freebies because you don't want to risk purchasing a bad app, don't worry.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I seen the movie and I knew,  I just had to have the cd. So I bought it and then the movie and they both are great. The cd is in great shape. It plays just fine!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun if you like hidden object games. I wish there were ways to trade coins or Collection pieces for crystals.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I bought this and 3 others for myself for Christmas and they will be a great tradition for our family for years to come!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Friend told me about it, so I got it.  Really enjoy the game.  It has good graphics and color. I recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love it!  Enjoy the format and clever writing.  Great character development.  Felt as though I truly knew and understood them.<br />Haven't quite finished the book. So enough of this.  I want to get back to the book!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|It doesn't look like acting. I lose myself in it. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee ARE Gus & Call. I read the books too. Rarely does a movie so honestly portray the book. The New York Times said about the book: If you only read one western in your life, read this one.  And I agree but I say that applies to this movie (TV mini series) also. I never tire of it. Every time I start watching it again I'm hooked. And it was shot in only 88 days.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Good book from a good series that left me entertained right till the end. It even tied up all the loose ends.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it. I always wondered what would have become of Danny. It is great to be able to revisit a story and its characters that I embrace d so long ago. The book kept me on the edge of my seat . And I hated to see it end.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Hello Gorgeous! This is the raw talent I enjoyed from my childhood. One of the all-time classic musicals every little girl with stars in her eyes should see.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I watched Lost for many years but as the series got older I got busier and did not watch it as much.  One of the local TV stations started running some of their reruns.  I got interested again.  I really enjoyed Season Four.  As a matter of fact, I ended up purchasing the entire 6 seasons.
B00F91H15W|4.0|Emma Watson branches out from Hermoine and becomes a brat at best.  It was interesting as this is true story.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|A local station began reruns.  I got involved and decided to watch the series again.  When it was on originally I watched the first few years but missed some as the series proceeded.  I was happy to watch the series from the beginning.  Season 5 was so good I had to get the finale.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|If you have a good ear you will here a lot of talent from this guy,I hope he sticks around ,a lot bands ask for him now for back up ,He has what it takes,hope he makes the long run,,,mike ,,,mpls',,,,,he,s coming here,don't pass on it ,,
B000MV8XPG|5.0|This was a birthday present for my three year old nephew, who is crazy about excavators. I put it together, which was quite simple,  before I gave it to him, and the look on his face when he opened it was priceless. It has gone through a summer of everyday use outdoors in the sand box. The only problem is the exhaust pipe behind the seat that keeps coming off. My nephew calmly gets his play tools and fixes it, then resumes the big dig.
0060989157|5.0|Motley crue, one of the most bad assed bands around. They did a pretty good job talking about their experience.
B000IEXVCC|1.0|If someone managed to escape from a mental institution... change their identity and become a director... then make a movie about the delusions in their head, would the film industry go for it?<br /><br />Would we all try to interpret and philosophy the meaning of the craziness they put on screen?<br /><br />... Would we call it art?
0743486285|5.0|Nikki Sixx did something amazing here. I loved reading this and it was a great thing to purchase. Glad I got to read this.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a great crime drama, and has some interesting insights into how UK law is different from US law.
B00FOQRNPA|5.0|It was a well researched book which I have read in long time I recommend strongly to any interested in ones health
B000ILZ66Y|5.0|Great book love it on my kindle it is great for reading on the beach. So happy with this purchase no issues with delivery
B004I1K430|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and this is as good.  Would recommend it to everyone.  Our friends have also enjoyed this story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book love it on my kindle it is great for reading on the beach. So happy with this purcahse
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game seems very easy at first, but looks can be decieving.  If you like challenging games, and you like to visually learn, this app is for you.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book love it on my kindle it is great for reading on the beach. So happy with this purchase. No issue with delivery
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I always wondered what happened to Danny. Well worth the wait for this hot story. I wish it was not finished already.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book love it on my kindle it is great for reading on the beach. So happy with this purchase. No issue with delivery
B007TVANDM|4.0|Pete the Cat's great attitude toward the anxiety-provoking issues of a child's life is something we can all learn from.  I bought this book, and the second of the series, not so much to read to small children, as for my own sake, because I love Pete's courage, and his positive attitude.  ...I haven't bought any of the other Pete books, though.  I kind of get the impression Pete's being overused.
B00061ZLS4|5.0|I finally found the Euro French version of Mulan. I was looking everywhere and at first it was up to at least $30. About a few weeks and months after I got Arthur Christmas, it was then cut to a lower price down to about $10. So I got that because the French on my English DVD is Quebec and I don't like Quebec French as much.
1401938906|5.0|Should be required reading.  Those of us who have always known this love to share what we know with<br />as many people as possible.  If people just try it they will see how simple life can really be.
1476733953|5.0|Let me say I will try to leave out any spoilers. Let me also say that this is the best Science Fiction book I have read in the last decade. Only J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Ring Trilogy surpasses this masterpiece by Hugh Howey and Stanger In a Strange Land barely passes it. I know that is saying a lot for this relatively new book by a relatively new author. Wool is a masterpiece of modern day literature.<br /><br />Born in a silo (not a small missile silo) but one of massive proportions, each inhabitant has his or her job and generally do them well. The consequences of no doing so can result in a slow painful death. It is also ingrained over generations to do the absolute best you can.<br /><br />Outside the silo is a soup of toxic pollutants which can eat through almost anything. This is the Earth of the future. There are two heart beats in the silo. The Mayor and Law enforcer's offices and unknown to many, IT, The office of Information Technology but only at the highest level of that office.<br /><br />Infractions of the rules are dealt with harshly. The offender is put in a somewhat toxin proof suit and expelled from the silo to clean the small window which is the citizens only right to see what is outside their walls. Did I say \\"toxin proof\\" suit? Well slightly toxin resistant is a much bet description. All who are expelled clean the window and then go as far a they can until they die in view of newly cleaned window. That is until the unthinkable happens. One person refuses and goes as far as she can. toward a legendary city in the distance.<br /><br />Well written, unique plot, and certainly a masterpiece, you will not want to miss this consistently great work by Hough Howdey. I rarely give such a high review. This is a rare exception. Read it please.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love hidden object games like this and am really enjoying it. I can tell this is a game I will enjoy for awhile!
B006PTZNSY|4.0|I liked nicki minaj when I first bought this. Honestly some of the tracks are quite good but I am kind of sick of her &#34;rap&#34; style. Sing she can but rap I am unconvinced. Her jump between doing a british accent is a little tiresome.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Will not allow me to sign up/log in.  App needs to be fixed, do not download. Wait until app is updated.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is just great - its super absorbing and it's a fresh take on dystopias.  The first novel is pretty much the best; it's a a complete story, at least, as compared to the other two.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome book I loved it from the beginning all the way to the end I can't wait to read the next one
B007J4T2G8|4.0|You know what?  This book made a lot of women have sexy thoughts, and explore parts of their sexual personas that they may not have otherwise explored.  How can I hate this book?  Go forth, all ye girlies, and be fruitful and multiply!  But if you like this book, realize that there are many MANY other sexy written syllables out there for you to consume, many MANY of them better written, with actual characters and plots and dialogue that doesn't make you want to gouge your eyes out with a spoon.  (Of course, when was any porn ever known for its dialogue...)  Just.... use this book as a gateway to the world of sexy print, not the final stop.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|The best thing about this browser, compared to others I have used, is that it takes little time to load, navigation is fast, and it is fairly dependable, operating with few hitches.  It has a very clean, uncluttered appearance, which is both a plus and a minus in that I miss having buttons, extensions, bookmarks, etc. always visible, without having to hunt for them in drop downs. It also does not seem to have as many tools or functions as some other browsers.  However, I have not been using Dolphin very long, so this will probably bother me less as I get more used to the program.  I also sometimes have problems filling boxes or clicking on links, but this may be the fault of my tablet and not the browser.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This series is just great - its super absorbing and it's a fresh take on dystopias.  The third one is different, because it turns out that Collins has been playing you for a fool all along, and it's not really been about what you thought it was about.  Which can either make you frustrated or make you read it again, your choice.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't stop reading it...and was sad when it was over. Awesome story, great characters, good ending - a perfect way to spend a weekend reading.
0380778556|3.0|I've read about this as sort of an early version of horror, but it's more &#34;psychological tension.&#34;  Feels silly to critique the writing much since it was written in such a different era where different things were expected.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I have never written a review on Amazon before, but I was so disappointed by this book that I felt the need to warn others. Cornwell's Scarpetta novels have been decreasing in quality for a while now, but this one was so spectacularly bad! I was reading and thinking okay, when is the story going to start when I realized I was 65% thru the book already. The &#34;mystery&#34; was ridiculous and the ramblings and whining of a menopausal Scarpetta had me rolling my eyes constantly. This is the last Cornwell/Scarpetta book that I will buy.
B003F1WM2K|3.0|This book was so okay, it made books that I have opinions about seem like rollercoaster rides.  Even the bad ones.  I don't think I've ever had less of an opinion about a book than this book.  If this book had a tagline, it would be &#34;These things happened.&#34;
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a fun read and I had a hard time putting it down. I was pleasantly surprised that it was so good.
0307474712|1.0|I have *NEVER* been so happy for a character to die as I was in this book.  I literally thought, &#34;Oh thank goodness, it will be over soon.&#34;  Ridiculous.  You'd think that a novel based on this premise would at least have one &#34;throwaway&#34; year, like, the one year where nothing momentous happens on that date, just to acknowledge the premise, but no, every single year something incredibly important happens on the same day and NO ONE EVER MENTIONS IT.  Couple the  the omg-so-beautiful-but-doesn't-know-it girl with the appeal-less super-jerk boy character who the girl thinks she can change (and she does!  lik dis if u cry evrytim).
B009RX7IX8|5.0|A great series, This is an early purchased gift which I am giving in Nov. for husband's B-day. I KNOW he will love it because he loves the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is just great - its super absorbing and it's a fresh take on dystopias.  The second novel is, like most seconds in a trilogy, the &#34;chase,&#34; but you can't have an end without a middle.
160059672X|4.0|hard foe me to get from pics..Im a nube.Having a hard time following. The pics dont make since. graphics for me could have been easier
8862937148|5.0|Got this as a gift but he hasn't given it back to me or begged me to return it so it must be ok.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed the different characters' stories that make up the novel.  It is a different style of writing than his other 2 novels and I really enjoyed it.  It came together very nicely at the end and I am looking forward to his next one!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book isn't about the plot, it's about the rich fantasy world that Morgenstern creates, a world I would happily pay big bucks to get into, but I will settle for a book I guess.
B0002KVULG|4.0|My favorite version of the Dracula story. Frank Langella is wonderful in the role of Dracula. Like so many I've always been appalled by the poor color of the DVD version. There is some good news,a Blue Ray disk was just released in Japan so there is hope for a U.S. release.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone else but she didn't like, complain about it or send it back, so it must be pretty good.
B00EQ30RVY|2.0|Just to make this clear, I'm not giving this a bad review because I hate Linkin Park/Chester and want Scott Weiland back.  To give some background on where I was coming from, I listened to Linkin Park when I was in Middle School-ish.  Upon entering high school and college, my music tastes matured and I got into more classic and indie rock bands.  LP doesn't appeal to me as much as they did when I was younger, but I still think they're better than STP fans will give the band credit for.  And Chester Bennington is absolutely one of the best singers of this generation.  I can't think of a better alternative singer to STP if it wasn't going to be Scott.<br /><br />I went into this album optimistically, and I feel like I have the unique perspective of being very familiar with the discography of both LP and STP.  But I was not pleased at all with the results.  All the songs here feel like very generic \\"meat and potatoes\\" hard rock.  The riffs are very uninspired, Chester's vocals feel a little imitative of Weiland, and it doesn't seem to have the idiosyncratic edge that made STP very unique in the past.  It just feels like they rushed this album out very quickly.<br /><br />While I completely understand why Scott was removed from the band, it is clear that he gave STP the more varied glam, pop, and psychedelic influences that made STP unique. You can see it in his solo albums.  I also think STP producer Brenden O'Brien played a \\"Fifth Beatle\\" role with the band, and his presence is another that can be felt missing, as it did on the self-titled album.<br /><br />I'm definitely not writing off this new incarnation of STP altogether.  This just isn't a very inspiring start.  I hope once they get a label and get really down to recording an album, we get more interesting music.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is so much fun! It is challenging, but not impossible, although sometimes it feels impossible. Just keep trying and you'll get it. I am hooked.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is my favorite board game of all time. I invite people over to play almost every week. I use the Better Settlers android app to generate random, yet balanced boards and it's always a blast.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like that you can see the weather at the top. Just got this app and look forward to using it on trips. Most other reviews show positive reactions to this app, so I decide to give it a try. I love my Kindle Fire HD!
B00D5YNQMW|4.0|Aerosmith have finally released a live dvd worth the time and effort to watch. The only don fall is, they have commentary betewen songs, when it should have been a straight live show, without any interruptions, and had the commentary and other footage unto itself. I hate it when bands do this, drives me absolutely farging crazy! Kiss is notorious for this, but their egos are out of control and they feel some uncontrollable desire to do this. I digress here, excuse me please. I love Aerosmith, always have, always will, though I wish they would rock as hard as they di back in the day, I. E., Toys, Rocks, etc.. Guitars had edge back then and they walked it, like they talked it, tougher back then. They still have it and are still one of the greatest American bands this country has ever produced. Do I recommend this, yes, it's finally a decent Aerosmith show caught on tape. Like I said, the down side to this is, the interspersed commentary between songs. Maybe if they do another one, it ill be a straight show?
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|A story that totally drew me in like a fish that swallowed a hook. Characters that you get attached to, multiple sub stories that link into and expand the main story with out confusion, and a world setting that feels genuine all combine into a truly pleasurable and enthralling read. Many thanks and compliments to the author.
B00DPH7QFM|4.0|Rainbow without RJD, isn't really Rainbow. Having said that, this is the last incarnation with Doogie White singing, touring promoting the last studio effort, Stranger In Us All, which is pretty decent album, but without the edge and power. This is the slicked down version, which to say it isn't bad, or should I say horrible, it is Ritchie Blackmore, enough said there. He plays brilliantly, the band is on. This is a must have for Rainbow fans and fans for all and everything Ritchie Blackmore. I had to have it, couldn't have gone on another day without it, but I am ate up.
B006C45MRE|2.0|Well the only positive aspect I can think of is that I did  not pay $13 to see it at the movies.  The acting was awful (never knew I would say that about Harrison Ford).  This movie almost put me to sleep.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app, works so you can read from anywhere at anytime.  It's like carrying around 5 or 6 books without the hassle.
1250029465|5.0|I read this on my Kindle and absolutely loved it.  How two living beings came together to bring hope to each other.
B004SDEP38|1.0|not very user friendly, i guess im to used to a pc program, does not interact with any Word files or e mail files

B001BKG9RQ|5.0|I don't have much Pink Floyd music so I didn't appreciate David Gilmore's talents. Just love the drama and exuberance of his playing. Saw the video of this concert and the joy of the crowd. What a celebration of an history changing event.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very handy, works great for everyday calculations. i would recommend this app for your smart S 4 phone and or kindle.
