B0031RS7EK|5.0|This is the story of Nick Stone (Why do the main characters always have cool names?) who is an ex-British commando and who currently works for the British government as a spy and field operative. Nick is sent to Washington to spy on two Irish terrorists (freedom fighters?) but a call from London tells him to cancel the mission and return home. Unexpectedly having found himself with time to kill, he decides to visit an old friend, also an ex-SAS and currently working for the DEA. When he comes to his friend's house, he finds his friend and the whole family murdered. The only survivor is his friend's seven-years-old daughter Kelly. Nick takes the girl from the house and soon finds himself hunted by mysterious government agents while his own government turns its back on him. To survive and to protect Kelly, he must investigate the mystery of his friend's murder. Along the way he and Kelly do some breaking and entering, fight Irish terrorists, get into a shootout with dirty cops on a highway, meet friendly strippers, get help from a Mafia mobster who likes to do Al Pacino impressions, get help from an ex-SAS soldier (How come there are so many of them living in Washington?) and meet the cast of Clueless, whom they rob at gunpoint.<br /><br />I know that what I just described sounds like an action movie mixed with comedy, but the book is neither and all the events and characters make perfect sense within the context of the story. In fact, the book is quite realistic. Unlike your typical action movie, I could picture all the events of Remote Control happening in real life.<br /><br />There are two parallel stories running through the book. The first one is the story of Nick's investigation into his friend's death. As he does so, he uncovers a conspiracy involving dirty cops, Irish terrorists and corrupt government officials. I will not say what the conspiracy is about because that would be a spoiler. Suffice to say that it is down to earth and realistic and not some JamesBond type of crazy plot. There is little mystery to it, however. At the beginning of the book there was a hint dropped that the conspiracy is not only American but also reaches into England. I right away made a guess who is involved and by the end of the book my suspicions proved correct. But to avoid spoilers, I will say no more.<br /><br />The second story is the relationship between Kelly and Nick. At first she is a burden that he takes with him only to protect his own skin. But then we read how he starts to grow attached to her and transforms into her adoptive father. The idea of partnering a male loner with a kid is nothing new. I've seen a dozen movies with that plot and most of them limited the interaction between the adult and the child to a few clichés and comedy moments. Most of the time the child is partnered with the loner so that funny things happen and the audience can laugh. Not so with this book. There are some clichés and funny moments, yes, but overall the relationship between Nick and Kelly is kept very serious and realistic and I did enjoy reading these parts very much.<br /><br />But I think that the book's main selling point is the author's knowledge of the subject matter. The author, Andy McNab, was himself an ex-SAS member and secret government operative. He fought in the First Gulf War and other places. The depth of knowledge about combat and spycraft given in this book is unparalleled. If anything, people who are interested in how commandoes and spies operate should read this book for nothing else but the amazing richness of information it contains.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|The acting is great. This goes along with the book very well and the casting was done quite well. Just look at all the names in it!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great series! Love the scenery and the characters are fun to follow. I can even understand 99% of the &#34;accent.&#34;
B004GTOKJS|5.0|My wife LOVED season one so much that she wanted to see this follow-on season. It did not disappoint. She loved it, too.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is my most favorite show ever!!! Awesome characters, fun and witty banter, and great characters! Never boring!! I love this show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is perfect and its free. hard to believe universal set this up but couldn't ask for a better app,  even my nieces can play with ease
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app kept my kids entertained for a good while. They actually spent time together figuring things out. A must have.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show. Watched the 1st year in one setting. Some quirky characters and great story lines. One of the best shows around.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I love the way she brings the characters to life. The richness of the details about the times that the characters are living in make this so very real.....I bought the entire series!
0312641893|5.0|I read this a couple of weeks ago , and it's a great start for a new writer. THE combination of Cinderella and science fiction is very different.There is more information in the second book about how Cinder became a cyborg. the main character is very down to earth( yes, pun intended) and her world is very realistic. The second book builds on the first one. A must read for fairy tale and science fiction fans.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My son and I both Love Om Nom and cannot leave him sad without his Tasty treats! This is a great continuation and as addictive as the original.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is a challenge but it not really hard good for kids it will keep them busy for a while.awesome game.<br />,
B00915G6WQ|4.0|Another great season of Dexter. Awesome series-changing events occur leaving you wanting more just as the season closes, just like always.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Simple and effective.  Eliminates the biggest problem in camera use. It is pricey but it is worth the extra dollars.
B00821OX98|4.0|I love shows, movies and books about alien invasions and the aftermath. This show is about how humanity attempts to survive after an alien race invades Earth and decimates most of the planet. It seems to be in a similar vein to Walking Dead but better because there are no zombies. Characters are pretty well developed and this adds to the thrill as you hope that certain characters will remain alive throughout the different episodes. All episodes were fast-paced and enjoyable.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I want information, like what the wind direction is, not just that it is going to be windy.The screens are not easy to glance at and get basic information.
B00BESIKWM|2.0|I can't remember whether I enjoyed the other Silent Hill(s) or not, but I thought I did so I decided to check this one out. After getting about halfway through the movie, I had already lost interest and just let it play as background noise while I did other things.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting journey about a neurosurgeons' experience with being in a coma.  A little self serving at times, but an easy read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I waited a while to read this trilogy and therefore had a lot of hopes for the series. It turned out to be great... just as promised
B000J159N8|3.0|I like Mel Gibson in just about anything but had trouble getting past his southern accent and the prospect of some one standing tall (Sam Elliot) during the fire fights was a little hard to believe but being a Viet Nam vet myself anything that puts that era in a positive light is welcome. I thought what was particularly well handled was the wives at home having to deal with not knowing if their husbands were ever going to come back. All in all a good movie but I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it.
B00BJA2VFW|2.0|I tried to download this app but was unable to do.  I have not played it since I can not download it.  It could be me not knowing how to do this.
B005HSL626|4.0|cutting fruit is okay play it in my free time but sometimes it gets boring just cutting fruit it's ok
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter is so crazy good....you gotta love the guy! Haven't finished them all yet,but am binge watching as fast as i can!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|it's an okay game but if you don't do the quests they won't let you go to the next level
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I wish I had read along time ago. You will want to read it. I am recommending it to you
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Wonderfully original, heartwarming, and full of laughs. Its a great watch that the entire family can enjoy, regardless of age.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Any princess girl will love this set.  My niece used it to add bling to her laptop and even used the decals to decorate her bedroom furniture.  Best part is it doesnt matter where she puts it, its harmless & can be removed easily.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Excellent perspective on success and the mindset of the successful.  I strongly recommend this material for anyone just starting out in bisiness.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|A must have for any soundtrack lover! Han Zimmer has created a master piece... Again!<br />Just phenomenal on all levels. The deluxe is the best buy with a song that is a 28 minute experiment in super hero epicness! A must have!
B009NY43NY|4.0|There was a lot of hype about the early spoilers online, but I didn't read them, because I wanted to find out for myself. Like with all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, I enjoyed reading the series finale as well. I was okay with Sookie's final love interest, and I thought the plot was entertaining, although, maybe a little complex for the bad guys' ultimate goal. I thought the series was ended nicely. My one complaint was the occasional transition from Sookie first person to third person, where we get an inside scoop of the bad guys plotting. I didn't really care for that. I think it took away from the mystery and surprise that I usually enjoy in Harris' novels. Overall, I was happy with this read. I'm still a Sookie fan, and I will eventually reread the entire series! ♥
B001W79MBI|3.0|I was really expecting more when it came to this film. It started out really good, but then in the middle it dragged on and began introducing all the characters to give them some kind of development, but not enough to make them interesting or likeable. The most arguably interesting character, the \\"villain\\", gets almost no development and ends up being another cliche. In fact, the movie is just riddled with lots of standard cliches we've seen countless times before, making it predictable and just not as good as it could have been. There's also A LOT of CG but that's kinda expected these days. In the end, it's a decent action flick but it had the potential to be great.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I used to find the weather app super useful, but now that the layout has changed so much it seems to be more about the videos and add ons. Some days you just want the forecast and it is written in tiny font squished the side. (This app also sucks the life out of your battery)
B00BF11UM0|5.0|The way the movie unrolled must have been an apt and accurate description of how our antiterror squads think and operate.  Hats off to our patriots who perform the difficult tasks, often much to their dislike.
B002RSU9PY|5.0|A must-watch movie. Second fave Hitchcock movie of mine after North by Northwest. Amazing how such a complicated story can unfold in such a small geographic space.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|If you're looking for a deep and meaningful plot with existential overtones and anything at all subtle, than this is not the film for you.  If you're looking for action and another exciting addition to the Die Hard series than look no further however!  Bruce Willis brings back John McClane as a mature father and tough middle aged cop with great success and the depiction of modern Moscow is bustling, busy, and timely.  No doubt some cultural feel for the mighty city in the east was done to bring this feel home to the film and it was done with great success.  There is one scene that is a little far fetched as John drives a stolen Range Rover over the roofs of cars in traffic, but what the heck, this isn't the only stretched reality that you will be asked to believe during the film.  I streamed this movie from Amazon Prime for a couple of bucks and truly got my moneys worth and had a great time.  To quote Adam Carolla, &#34;Bruce looks like the kind of guy who drives cars fast and shoots guns and that's why we like to see him do it on film&#34;.  Absolutely.  I would watch an action movie with Bruce any day over a bigger budget movie with a more popular leading man because Bruce brings some degree of reality to the action.  There are some great lines between father and son too, so kudos to the writing team.  I might even have to watch this one again.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This is exactly what I said above; based on a true story about an extremely ill killer of children, to be polite, - it may be upsetting to some.  It shows what one very devoted and determined mother suffers through to find out what happened to her, and to other families, missing children.  Well done and highly recommended. It is pathetic to think that this type of thing went on and this woman and our justice system treated her this poorly ~ with the exception of one man who was not afraid to do what was right.  Quite the moving story.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Instantly one of my favorites, loved it, awesome story, super writing, please read this shiny book.  Can't wait for more.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very similar to shades of Grey!  Wow! Mr. Crossfire is an incedible character! Twists and turns around each page of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS IS SIMILAR TO TEMPLE RUN AND SUBWAY RUNNER BUT HAS THE MINIONS.  VERY FUN GAME WITH GREAT DETAILS TO THE MOVIES.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I  really enjoyed this app. It is definitely worth the money because no matter how long you play it, there is still more fun stuff to do.
B00280LYIC|5.0|i was blown away. the detail was spectaculer and if loved the book ul really enjoy the movie dont forget the 2nd one is coming out soon.
B0029XFN9O|4.0|Loved the movie. Macaulay Culkin is a wonderful actor. I never get tired watching his movies, he's always a delight.
B008220C38|5.0|This film heeded advice of the Russian formalists. It was 'Make it new!'. They claimed that any piece of art or literature must create as many ripples and oddities as possible. This way our perception of the mundane reality will be altered. We will see the world in a new light, which is the purpose of art.<br /><br />The film is made in this tradition - it is one big oddity. It is unusual and sometimes feels like a theater and sometimes like a Monty Python episode. It's unlikely to appeal to those with a taste for traditional drama. But for me - as a Russian - if feels authentic and true to the spirit of the Russian art. My minor qualm is that Anna Karenina in the film is less sympathetic and more eccentric than she should be. Her \\"problem\\" was her moral integrity and the fact that she was unwilling to keep her affair secret like everyone else in the book. But the authors of the film chose to depict her as an unbalanced neurotic female. That's been said, I highly recommend it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I had wanted to read this book for awhile, and happened to catch it on special, I loved it, Tina Fey is hilarious!
B002JXK5VU|4.0|A continuing sci-fi soap opera of a town in the southwest that houses geniuses working on further-than-leading edge science, overseen by a regular-sort-a-guy sheriff.  It's mostly fun, even if the science often goes beyond sci-fi to fantasy and the characters are a little stereotyped.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins is among my favorite authors.  love his books and always learn something besides the entertainment value.  Great read, fast moving plot and great character development
B008PWUWLC|4.0|I liked the colors and style of this case overall. The grip makes it easy to stand the reader on a desk or table for hands-free reading. I found that the coloring of the stripe across the front gets dirty easily if you're commuting and throwing it into a purse or bag, as I am. The case itself is pretty rugged though.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I'm not sure what I can say that other reviewers haven't already said, but I loved this book. This is one of my favorites in the entire series, and when I got done with it, I almost started the whole series over again because I wanted to re-experience it in terms of what I learned from this book--which is who The Ghost is. And no, no spoilers here; I am not telling who it is.<br /><br />Kaleb is a great hero. I am not fond of Type A heroes who come across as controlling jerks, and Kaleb is juuuussst this side of being that type of hero. What really redeemed him in my eyes is that he clearly cares for Sahara, and listens to her and respects her. Sahara is a wonderful complement to him. She is strong but doesn't fear Kaleb's strength nor is threatened by it. If I had any nits, it would be that I thought she came out her self-imposed \\"labyrinth\\" awfully quickly after the trauma that she had been through.<br /><br />Otherwise, though, it was a fantastic addition to the series.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|questions that most of us have about death as we think it may be are not necessarily answered in totality. a good account of what possibly awaits us eventually is presented in mostly simple terms.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Truly a great experience.  This game is the total package as far as app games are concerned.  Don't even think about starting it unless you have a few hours on your hands.  It is a trap designed to render you oblivious to everything in the world around you.  The Room draws you in immediately and by the time you realize that you're in trouble it is far too late to do anything but keep playing.  Chalk up one sick-day at work.<br />For $1.99 you won't find this level of entertainment anywhere!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I thought this was a decent movie I just wish they had not called him Jack Reacher since he is nothing like the book character.
B001N474GA|5.0|It's a pleasure to watch real meat & potato actors chow down on great writing. This might be Pacino's best work in many years. The man is really working. A stunner.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great movie. I like the movie and my kid loves the movie. My wife likes it too but she runs around too much to actually enjoy a movie. She also talks during movies so it's ok if she runs around during the movie.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|very handy good photos take it with me every where in bag wipp it out point and touch it done.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This is a great movie! Lots of action and no slow moments. I would recommend the movie to anyone. Thanks.
1401311091|3.0|Since I had watched the TV show prior to reading the book, I had to reverse my mentality about the characters.  I was hoping for a little more chemistry between Nikki Heat and Rook to come across the pages, I think they slept together way too fast.  I would have liked to see a little more of Rook &#34;chasing&#34; Heat to win her over.  The storyline regarding the mystery was a little fragmented, it jumped around a little too much.  A couple times I had to go back and read a section because I lost the train of thought. I wasn't sure of the killer until the very end, which was good.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg was honest, vulnerable and incredibly insightful. I've been able to relate to many things, and some things I was not able to relate to. I worked hard and rose the ranks and was fortunate enough to be exposed to positive, supporting mentors that were men, and probably just as fortunate to be exposed to the schmuck, and the &#34;she's a woman&#34; attitude. I've learned a lot from both experiences on several intellectual and emotional levels. I especially liked the &#34;don't leave before you leave&#34; portion as that reminds you to stay focused on the task at hand and keep the foot on the pedal no matter what, until in fact you do leave. I have found that if and when you do come back, you have driven so far that its much easier to start from where you left off than from miles behind. Lessons learned here, great takeaways.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Want to watch a movie with young upcoming stars from the 90's? Here's your fix! I laughed through the whole movie and you will too. Great cast!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Really enjoyed this and the ending really makes you think.  Life on a life boat with 4 or 5 others just trying to survive is a struggle.
B001BR5NH6|5.0|It came in time. It was in excellent condition. They did a wonderful job on the the gift wrapping. The person I got it for loves the movie. I will order from this company/ person again.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|I loved it!<br /><br />It is a old movie and is very good!! Danny de Vito and Matt Damon are great actors!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have loved this game forever, so when I got my tablet I downloaded it right away.It is fun and relaxing, great game
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I had heard the critics panned this when it came out so I never saw it in the Theater but I enjoyed the cast of characters and the story.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|So everything was fine and the game was really fun, but at the first desert level, I kept spawning in off the stage! I died as soon as the level started and I had no way of moving. This made me sad because leps world 2 is my favourite app, and now I can't play it.
B001LM1456|4.0|We've been on a kick of catching up with the current super-hero movies and I enjoyed this one.  Nothing complex about it, but I liked the flash-back, Hulk-eye-view sequences and the CGI was pretty seamless.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a great thinking persons game. Finding clue items, and using them (or not), to escape the room is a great stress reliever. (Especially if you're stuck somewhere you really don't want to be). Escape!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very sexy Very emotional.  I love that Gideon and Eva are so supportive of each other and they have such devotion for helping each other with their problems.
B00DU73T08|2.0|This is one of those movies that was truly a far cry from the book. The inner voice of the lead character became irritating after a while and really ruined the most of the movie for me.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I am a huge Intel fan, Just like this chip its fast and overheating is not a problem. Just love it.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|I was going to buy the HD versions of Star Trek but read reviews that said the sound was almost inaudible at times, especially when music is playing. It is that way streamed from Amazon prime as well. Otherwise, it's beautiful. It helps that I have the episodes pretty much memorized!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|this is a great game. the only problem I can think of is that you can only play a few games at a time before you have to wait to get more coins.
B005C6NFIG|5.0|This album is so different from the other albums Incubus has released, but it is SO GOOD. The music, the lyrics, the production, the booklet - All of it. Listen for yourself. If you even only /like/ Incubus, you'll love this album. Buy it today - I mean, if not now, when??
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I recently purchased this game and I love it!! I'm doing great so far and I have alot of kibble and bling using a trick I found out!!! I didn't had to &quot;buy&quot; anything!!!! I can help anyone out if they having trouble with the game!!
B00B52F278|5.0|How long does it take to release this DVD? It came out in England in APRIL. Why do we have to wait? Shabby behavior from a DVD company I once respected. What is the delay? I guess I can watch this over and over on Starz OD, but then I'll be so sick of it I won't WANT the DVD come September.<br /><br />Good move, Anchor Bay. Strike while the iron is COLD.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|A lot of fun to play but beware of purchasing gems and coins. On two desperate occasions I purchased both but did not receive them. I contacted support who told me that the problem would be corrected and I would receive my coins/gems.  After numerous contacts with them I never received what I paid for. Still playing the game though.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Must be seen!!! It is a movie that will capture your life like you wouldn't believe. It is a movie that anyone would see it more than once.

140006922X|3.0|If this were a work of fiction like the Da Vinci Code, then it would be fine. As a work of Non-Fiction, it's lacking. I enjoyed the book for the most part, knowing what it was: someone's opinion and pure conjecture. Its like watching a period piece in a movie in that you have an insight on the period in history, but its certainly not a scholarly work or has anything to do with who Jesus really was. Portraying it as a scholarly work is what's dishonest about this book. Scholarly work needs more attributions and the ability to inspect source material to make up our own mind. Brown in The Da Vinci Code tried to portray it as based on facts & truth. It wasn't. It was an embellished book of fiction with half-facts to make a compelling story and it did a GREAT job of it. This is no different. If you actually want to learn history and truth, then you're looking in the wrong place.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Love this movie, I watched it a ton when I was younger.  Had to get a copy on DVD :)
0345803485|5.0|Thank you for the prompt delivery, it made it in time for vacation.  I was able to read it on the deck of the cruise boat, sun and fun, thanks again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game.  My kids, ages 7 &amp; 9, also enjoy it.  It's a great game for everyone in my family.
B005HED11Y|5.0|If you are a trekkie like me, you will like to go back to where it all began. The remastering in HD is just great. The young Captain Kirk, Spock, Bones all are here. The first season tells you why this futuristic show has got such a wide following.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game. It's fun and easy and is great to play if you have nothing to do. It works well, too. I'd give it an 8/10 stars.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There is no comparison with Downton Abbey. Wonderfully produced with memorable characters and a developing story. The interior scenes are simply wonderful -- worth seeing the series.
0553801473|5.0|My hubby and I are HUGE fans of The Game Of Thrones and this book was in perfect condition and has aided in our addiction of the books and show!
B008N1V11U|2.0|While the graphics and voice acting are solid,it features shallow combat, boring gameplay, a poor excuse for stealth, and a awful attempt at a mobile arkham city
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|This is a great movie to see with parents.  It has some funny moments and is short enough that it doesn't drag on.  It takes too long to develop into the plot but the acting is quality so it helps. It is good for what it is and that is a good movie to see with parents or grand parents.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|A great read, that leaves you guessing until the very end. Another great Lincoln Lawyer story. I would definitely recommend this book.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show. The characters are fantastic and likeable. The story is compelling and characters are vulnerable which makes them identifiable.
B000J2BRQU|3.0|Kind of liked the whole racing sideways thing, but still, no Paul Walker.  Are you kidding me?  What's a \\"furious\\" without Walker?  And also, that kid's southern accent was a bit too much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. awesome characters, great story line. can't wait for the next seasons.  Crushed with some of the episodes,  grab a box of Kleenex
B0018OFN2W|2.0|Bad acting, or script, or both.  Eva Mendez has done better.  And to top it all, no Vin Diesel.  Need I say more?
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Catchy and a real delight for a changed.  They are unfamiliar to people who don't get into the Music like I do.<br />Too bad because this a FUN find for people like me...ha-ha
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Just like i remembered as a child! it is a great read for kids of, all ages, my 6 year old loved it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Nice job of finishing the series [at last].  The early books were great but I found the middle ones somewhat wordy and slow.  This is very action packed and keeps your attention through out.
B000063V8S|5.0|Fantastic seller, prompt service and product in excellent condition. I love this show and this set does it the justice deserved.<br /><br />- Works on my dated media players for PC<br />- Works on DVD player<br />- Typically 4 Episodes per CD, with Episode number/name on them individually.<br />- Menu interface is well organized and very well done (i.e.options, scene selection, episodes have auto-playing mini-clips above their titles)<br /><br />I'm very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone looking to complete their collection. I took a gamble buying the full set of this version, but I found it was truly worth it. Did I mention I love this show? I tend to forget the show was filmed in the 80's and early 90's. A lot of love&talent went into this show, not just from the actors/actresses, but the sets, sfx, costumes, and the incredible writers.<br /><br />If you're new to TNG, try to find some episodes on Netflix, Hulu, or Vudu. Sci-fi, drama, comedy, period-pieces such as Sherlock Holmes themes - it's got a little bit of everything. Every episode has it's very own charm.

A lot of love&talent went into this show, not just from the actors/actresses, but the sets, sfx, costumes, and the incredible writers.<br /><br />If you're new to TNG, try to find some episodes on Netflix, Hulu, or Vudu. Sci-fi, drama, comedy, period-pieces such as Sherlock Holmes themes - it's got a little bit of everything. Every episode has it's very own charm.

B005VMSATA|3.0|worth watching. As with any superhero movie you have to enter it believing that what you are going to see can and should be happening.<br /><br />I love the GL story, so I buy in to the world.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I started reading this book. The writing and descriptions are wonderful. Coming to terms with childhood tragedy is not easy and I was rooting for the main character to find happiness and contentment. I loved the Ireland setting and the main characters. Life in rural Ireland in 1974 was very simple. I could smell the baking aromas in Rose's kitchen like I was there. I will remember The Misremembered Man for a long time.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I've been a fan of this show since day one! I love my Winchester boys!! Great season! If you're a fan of Castiel (I mean who isn't) this season is for you!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Highly developed characters, wonderful scenery and costumes, great story lines. I thought it might take awhile to get into the series, but two episodes in, I was hooked. Can't wait until Season 5!!!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Amazing in this day and age such a great script and great actors can get it done in an hour and a half.  It actually feels suddenly over, rather than dragged out way too long. For example, Alec Baldwin's famed soliloquy is actually his only appearance in the movie, and it's early on.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you enjoyed any other books by Follett, you will continue that pleasure with this one! I can't wait to get to the next book.
B00005JLYW|4.0|I don't know what the extra scenes were, but then again it's been 10 years since I saw the movie.  Anyway, it's a great entertaining flick full of fluff and suspension of reality.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Mrs. Harris could have ended this series so much better...you could really tell that she ran out of material for Sookie's story.  It was almost like Mrs. Harris just could wait to get it over with!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The Ad-Free version doesn't have any ads popping up so it's well worth the $0.99. It's fairly intuitive to use and offers lots of fun and amusement, especially if you're waiting in the doctor's office or at the airport. The sound effects are hilarious. However, one of the buttons does give you information about other games you could buy. It only shows this info if you push the button. At least it doesn't just pop up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great drama series. It will have you crying at times adn laughing at others. I would recomend this show to anyone!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This is a really good movie! It is very compelling and tells a great human story that turned a tragedy into a triumph!
B000VIPJKM|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. I would recommend it for a light-hearted but not totally frivolous evening of entertainment. This little movie actually had some depth and a message to it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|No one creates magic systems like Brandon Sanderson. I love the way he creates a whole new system in every series. This is a terrific read that I just couldn't stop until it was finished.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton is a great series.  The rotating cast and plot twists are occasionally predictable, however, never boring.  Thanks for the entertainment!
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|i think this movie was really great to watch..........can't wait to get it on bluray.......more than likly dec. (hope its before) every thing in this is big, the way that its been done, the fx department (Bravo)  Almost all of the previews are in the begining of the movie so i was not prepared for every thing that happened after.  there is a hole other movie here.  i love these kind of movies some people will say its to long but, i was just blown away by the hole thing. just like a look back at the movies of the 50's.  well done job for all who worked on this flim.  bigger dosen't even begin to discribe this movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I had to read  this book  for my going into eighth grade summer reading book. I honestly thought i wouldnt like it but i read it  in three days! It really made me want to meet august! It really is a good inspirational bullying book to prove what could happen to someone getting bullied.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My friend recommended this show, and I became instantly hooked. It is really interesting to see each character grow each episode and to see the relationships between characters.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is great to catch up and watch on my own time line. But the best is 42 minutes of program without interuptions.
B00003CXB2|5.0|And a fantastic DVD to hold it in! In the ten years since this bundle was released, the package hasn't aged a day. This is the way to watch Lawrence on the home screen.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Witty, introspective and quite humorous at parts.  I was expecting a pretty good show after all the attention it got at the Oscars, but the humor and heart in this film were a pleasant surprise
B008IJHIAA|5.0|Document is one of the greatest records of the 80's. It's already essential, but the live disc and other materials that come with this package really put it over the top. A must-have for R.E.M. or rock fans.
0385344228|5.0|A friend recommended Defending Joshua telling me that one night she had to literally hold her eyelids open in order to finish it. \\"Do not assume you know anything while you read it,\\" she warned. I had purchased the book already and it was on my shelf so that night I pulled it off the shelf and began to read. Hot Damnn!  It was so good! A mystery, a thriller, perfectly paced...my favorite kind of book.  I ripped right through it.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" reminded me a bit of Jodi Piccoult's \\"Plain Truth\\" in its exciting courtroom drama depiction. I would say better than Turow's \\"Presumed Innocent\\" in its deliberateness.  The subject is a delicate one...a son, Jacob, 15, is accused of killing a fellow student in cold blood.  His parent's, pillars of the community, are traumatized, shocked, sick - you can actually feel their pain though Landay's words. They marvel and wonder, as any parent would - Could our son have done this? That fact that Jacob's Dad is the cop assigned to the case gives the reader a unique perspective. The havoc wreaked on the marriage and all the secrets spouse chose not to share is fascinating.  Do not miss this one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched all seasons and this show keeps me coming back for more! I can't wait to see what's in store for the Crawleys.
0399159347|5.0|This is my first Liane Moriarty novel. After completing it, I immediately placed \\"What Alice Forgot\\" in my Amazon cart! \\"The Husband's Secret\\" is terrific - extremely well-written and entertaining. The lives of three major female characters are intertwined in the most imaginative way. Cecelia is your average perfect Mom \\"joiner.\\" Life is everything she wants it to be and Cecilia has it by the tail - a handsome husband, three healthy girls, a thriving business and a community presence she and her family can be proud of.<br />One day Celcilia happens upon a sealed letter in her husband's hand that proclaims, \\"only open in the case of my death.\\"  How could she not open it?  Of course she does and what ensues is unthinkable.<br /><br />Tess has her best friend/cousin and her husband ask to speak to her to proclaim that although they have not consummated their relationship, they are in love.  Can you say, every woman's nightmare? Tess abruptly leaves with her son to visit her Mom who happens to live in the same area as Cecilia.<br /><br />Lucy's son is moving soon and taking the love of her life, her grandson Jacob, with him and his \\"perfect\\" wife to America.  Lucy's daughter was murdered many years ago and she works at the grade school where she suspects her daughter's murderer works.<br /><br />Cecilia kids and Tess's son attend the same grade school where Lucy works.<br /><br />What a great set-up for a story, right?  The book does not let up on the suspense or the interesting development of characters.  I love a book that makes the reader think: What would I do if that happened to me? If introspection were not enough, Ms Moriarty turns the story on its ear with the fascinating ending!  This is a book that combines clever mystery with the intricacies of delicate relationships in a very surprising way!  Enjoy it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's great pass time I just wish the points for investment were cheaper.  Or at least the ways to earn them was bit easier
B001YV506S|1.0|this product had nothing on it for the 2nd time. All I wanted was to see this film. I paid $ 12.75, & still haven't seen the film.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Love this movie.  Heard the song the other day which made me think of the movie.  Rented it from the Library then decided I wanted one of my own to keep.  Loved it!!
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|This wasn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't great.  It felt like I was watching an average episode of some crime drama.
B003L20IHE|5.0|GReat movie the flow  of the movie made wait to see what happen next .  well tell friends and family .what a great gift anyone .
B000OBYLVO|5.0|This movie just makes my wife and I feel good, had a bad day at the office? The Holiday, burned dinner? The Holiday, had an argument earlier in the day? The Holiday, get the picture? it just makes you feel good about things.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Enjoyed the story lines and then seeing how each story went together at the end . great movie  . will watch many times
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|I love this game, can't say enough good things about it, it was worth every penny I spent on it. Playrix games are always excellent, the graphics are beautiful, the characters are cute and colorful.......Love It! I'm no where near completing the game yet and I'm already getting sad that in the next week or so I'll be at the final level.
B009AGRE5O|4.0|It's predictable but fun. You get to see how Laurie Strode deals with an encounter that has haunted her for a long time and now her teenaged son gets entangled. She gets the final word plus the original music is cool.
0062280228|3.0|I am a huge Gaiman fan and have been waiting for him to get back to adult fiction for some time. I thought Ocean at The End of The Lane was adult fiction, and disappointed to find it wasn't. It's a nice story where the witches are forces for good and the protagonist is a seven year old who thinks like a 14 year old except for the stated sexual innocence. I have read other young adult books that I liked very much, but this one wasn't thought provoking. The only lines of thought it provoked in me was to think that if I were a 12 year old, this book would give me nightmares. Other than that it was predictable--no plot twists--all problems inexplicably solved through means not described because the 7 year old protagonist is too young to understand. A nice read for an adult who doesn't expect too much, or a psychologically disturbing book if you happen to be twelve.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Movie was OK, but didn't like the sub-titles at the bottom of the picture. Could not remove the sub-titles using the program options.<br />This goes for all of the 007 Movies purchased.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|wonderfull great show reminded me of my childhood from staying up all night and watching in in the morning nenever getts old :)
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love it downloaded 529 songs great app to use  and to listen to trying to figure out how to get it to my smart phone
B004W1GCNC|5.0|had many historical facts correct.... lots of errors, but was pretty well done. Good enough for the history buff, excellent for the drama of a war time series. Great picture and sound work, not amateur or lame production. I recommend this, it was fun!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you can get beyond the first few chapters, the interwoven story lines begin to make sense. Not as great as the Kite Runner, Hosseini has written a wonderful tale of love lost and found in the most unexpected place.
1432794426|5.0|This is truly a stand out book about our guy Michael.Karen writes from the heart and truly understands all that Michael endured and how unfair this world was to him.I stand tall beside Karen in defending our King of Love.if everybody read this book, he would get the respect he was deprived from his entire life.God Bless you Dr. Karen Moriarty
B0063IH60K|4.0|Helps me pass the time while wife is touching and feeling all the produce at Safeway, CostCo, ect. The draw is one card at a time. I'm still trying to figure out how to change the game to use the typical three card draw.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Read the entire trilogy. Finished it only because I kept hoping it would get better, but I was disappointed. I'm glad it didn't cost much.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This version is faster then others I've tried. Tap a card and it will automatically to to an appropriate card or you can slide it to where you want it if there is more then one possibility.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I think The Killers are a great band.  This album is terrific and I listen to it a lot.  Great voice!!!!!
B009WUBERW|4.0|It's done in the traditional comic book way where everyone does super hero stuff and you're gazed with lots of super tech stuff on screen. Very entertaining...lots of kool action...definitely not a chick-flick.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The acting was very good. I thought the story captured the essence of the man and showed that not only was he a great leader but that he was an outstanding politician.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've seen people reading this book on the train and in salons for quite some time. I never thought anything of it - until I purchased it on my Kindle! I just want to say WOW! From the first chapter, I was caught up in this compelling story of Ana Steele and her strange dealings with the elusive Christian Grey.<br /><br />Can I just say how HOT he is?!!!!! Great story! Very addicting. I immediate the bought the sequels after finishing Book 1!!! Great read if you're looking for some steamy love scenes. I'm reading the entire series AGAIN RIGHT NOW!!!!
B004BDJS9Q|5.0|more intertaining than the first time I watched it years ago. even got my wife to sit through the entire movie.
B00BIRRDZ4|4.0|I really enjoy Dawes, and they didn't let me down with their latest album.  It has quickly become one of my favorites.  While I feel their sound evolves a bit with each album, they continue to deliver smooth music with powerful, thoughtful lyrics.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Cute, fun date night movie. I own it and Love it! Classic Paul Rudd film. Spin off story from the movie, &#34;Knocked Up&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and addictive!  You never want to put it down.  Minion's are cute!  A must game to get for tons of fun.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I haven't used it for everything, but since I installed it on my tablet, I haven't had any trouble<br />find a viewer for any files I need to look at online.  Since I can download and save them on my<br />tablet and go back and look at them later, this is great.  If I wish to edit, I just move them to my<br />PC, do the work and then move them back to mobile.  Very easy to do over wireless.<br /><br />Keep up the great work, Mobile Systems, Inc.!
B005ZD8I6K|4.0|The style is gritty and very much in the style of a comic with scene and shot choices. Good action and story.  Enjoyed it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this on my tablet as it puts the temp and current conditions easy to see on my tablet.<br />It is a no fuss app with minimal system demands.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|it does what it should and even has an option to upgrade in order to ue your own music. reliable and easy to use.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Used it steadily for all five books. Concise, complete and inexpensive.<br />Here are nine words to complete the review.as required.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|So glad that Amazon Instant Video carries the Original Star Trek Series to watch in a click! Having the HD option is especially cool too.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The story was very good, some nice surfing scenes and some good positive life advice.  I thought a couple of the characters could have been a little stronger but overall I really enjoyed it and will definitely watch it again!
0811874192|5.0|Looking for a gift for someone who is hard to buy for? This is a very unique gift that will please anyone of the female gender.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|**SPOILERS**<br />Eclipse is the end of the love triangle (as far as im concerned anyways) between Edward, Jacob and Bella. Eclipse: as usual these movies arent about any sub plots, there about  whose going to get the girl. By the end of Eclipse.. and for that matter by the end of New Moon its Very clear that Bella has only got eyes for Edward and Jacob is chasing his tail (pun intended) still trying to win her love. Sure, sure there is the side story with the &#34;newborn army&#34; but thats all it really is, just a side story, a tie in, a little more plot.  However this movie is very cool and earns 5 stars as we get back stories on Many Characters (they should have done this on BD#2) The question of who Bella will end up with is over and a new segment of this story starts (the proposal) and two more movies to show us how that new story line pans out.  Eclipse is a good movie, the story changes and there are real developments.  Yes its a little cheesy, but i cant get enuff of this cheese.. how sad is that.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loved this game, it it kept me playing for hours at a time. It is challenging and addicting at the same time!
B00001PE4D|4.0|and must have watched it 10 times in my 20's.  I re-ordered it to watch again in my 30's as i sold my last copy years ago. Its not as fantastic and riviting as i thought i remembered, although its deffinately twisted and sinister.. Its a modern re-make of Dangerous Liaisons (classic) and still a good watch.  There is some fairly serious overacting and i never picked up on that when i was younger, there is also some fantastic acting.. that i also never picked up on when i was younger.  I will re-watch it again in 10 years and see what i think of it. The soundtrack was alos very good for the time too.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Just like any micro transactions game, you'll hit a wall which, unless you've got unlimited time, you'll have to pAy to progress. Good game otherwise.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Im not going to detail this movieas im sure its been reviewed to death on here. D.D. is a classic that never truly gets old, its a great movie. Anyone that doesnt squirm in there seat a little durring some of those scenes, or cry a little durring others is either so jaded there hopeless or so young there clueless.. Im a 30 something and love this movie. classic.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I felt an  emotional connection with the characters.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I have actually completed all the levels and then started over because I liked it so much. This was awesome as a FAOTD  but I would galdly pay a fee for it. The best part is it cost nothing to download and nothing to play! Love It!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Great for the price, the foam grip feels nice and there are many options for camera and accessory placements with the moveable thumbscrews. The only thing I noticed is that the entire handle is made of (somewhat flexible) plastic and this will cause the grip to bounce if you have weight on the top and bottom of the unit.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I couldn't put this down.  Had a lot of fun playing it and am looking forward to more rooms. Hopefully they get a bit more challenging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You can get cool stuff to help you and it is fun<br />P.s you can get all of the  Minion
B009C7JS14|5.0|Got to say is that this that. I love this app. And that you can see what the temp is at the moment....
B005LAII80|5.0|When I first saw the trailer's for this movie, I didn't think much of it and I didn't think that it was worth seeing. This was largely due to the 1995 movie Judge Dredd which was godawful. However, when I finally did get around to seeing it, i regretted that I did not see it in 3d at the theaters. This movie is an amazing, badass, ultraviolent action flick that always kept me on the edge of my seat and entertained. The stunning visuals work together perfectly with the plot, which revolves around a drug that slows down the user's perception of time and enhances colors, making for some of the best use of slow motion ever in movies. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes action or is a fan of the Judge Dredd comics. Oh and have no fear, 2000 AD readers, this movie stays true to the comics, with the only difference being a slight change in costume.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Just as enjoyable as the previous Quell games. All the puzzles are challenging, so far all can solved. So far...
B002W7H3EA|4.0|Well worth rewatching. The scenery is worth the watching in and of itself, and the acting is as it should be.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Shawn Achor's concepts remind me of the research that Laurel Mellon has been doing on EBT - that we can change the signals in our brains and create new neural networks.<br /><br />When this book was recommended to me, my assumption was that it was written for the general reader, however, the Happiness Advantage is definitely more of an academic discussion.  Still very enjoyable and a fairly easy read.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|I have seen this movie maybe 5 times since it first was issued, and it still plays well. The dark humor and overacting make this one of the better American made films.
B0035S996U|5.0|Great movie. I come from the Coney Island area and love to see the history change. I've watched this movie many times and it has been years since I've seen it last. Had a craving to see it again and even watched it with my sis to reminisce. Great gang style movie and interesting on there journey. A must see, over and over again.. Check it out
B0034JKZ86|4.0|Bowling for Movies Score: 192 of 300<br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />The Princess and The Frog - We have the 1-Disc DVD - soon to be upgraded to BLU RAY<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />\\"Jazzed up\\" (literally) retelling of a classic fairytale set in the happening town of New Orleans during the golden age of jazz... standard Disney fare with plenty of story spins, new friends, exciting locations, good music, and even some tragedy.<br /><br />Overall I really liked this movie - it was set in a fun time and in a fun place (New Orleans).  The marketing campaign didn't do this movie any favors and I really didn't want to see it but my daughter got her way (and I got mine because I bought the cheapest version I could get my hands on) and I was so corrected.  I headed into this movie with a bad attitude and quickly found myself lost in the magic of the city and time and riding a rollercoaster of emotion - from happy, sad, scared, enchanted, amused, horrified, stupefied, and frankly cheerfully exuberant (and I'm a dude).  We have a running joke in this house - If it's a Disney flick - SOMEONE HAS TO DIE  - how many parents have to die for a Disney story (at least one per film, right ha!) but this film had a seriously tragic spot worthy of a rather large snot bubble and some mournful blubbering (my daughter was right there to comfort me).  This movie has more heart than, um, your average earthworm?  That sounded better in my head but you get the point.  I have few purchasing regrets and this was one of them - I went cheap when I should have gone all the way - this movie is slated for a BLU RAY UPGRADE :]<br /><br />What I loved:<br />1.  Fits right into the Disney family of movies with modern sensibilities<br />2.  Truly funny character doing funny things  - a chipped tooth has never made me laugh more<br />3.  Disney captured the essence of southern Louisiana culture from The Big Easy to the backwoods bayou<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />1.  Traditional animation with many spectacular scenes gives way to less than great segments with poor detail, no shading, and a straight to home video feel<br />2.  Very young children could be scared of the many voo-doo sequences and spooky shadow spirits<br />3.

This movie has more heart than, um, your average earthworm?  That sounded better in my head but you get the point.  I have few purchasing regrets and this was one of them - I went cheap when I should have gone all the way - this movie is slated for a BLU RAY UPGRADE :]<br /><br />What I loved:<br />1.  Fits right into the Disney family of movies with modern sensibilities<br />2.  Truly funny character doing funny things  - a chipped tooth has never made me laugh more<br />3.  Disney captured the essence of southern Louisiana culture from The Big Easy to the backwoods bayou<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />1.  Traditional animation with many spectacular scenes gives way to less than great segments with poor detail, no shading, and a straight to home video feel<br />2.

B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|really enjoy the variety of stories that being in a space station allows.  lots of good character and intriguing potential
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this page-turner of a book, set in World War 2 and in the present day. Told in alternating points of view by a former spy and her daughter, who has just discovered that her mother is not who she thought she was, it captures the relationships between mother and daughter, spy and spy handler and daughter and lovers really convincingly. Lots of accurate historical detail, plenty of suspense and a couple of red herrings keep the plot moving along. Great fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever love it get away from the police and getting lots of coins also  getting up your score awasome thank u!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!¡
140006922X|3.0|In all, I liked the tone and tenor of the book. I applaud the author's desire to take on the extensive research, translations, and heat for approaching a topic such as this. BUT - the central figure in the story's name wasn't Jesus. Jesus is a translation of the Latin, which is a transliteration of the Greek, which is a rendition of the Aramaic, which is derived from the Hebrew Yehoshua. It's little things like this ... If you're trying to chronicle the man, the it just works better to talk about Yehoshua, who had a mother and a father and a brother, as opposed the the legendary Jesus the Christ. I guess it's a problem of consistency.
0805092447|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this book.  There are exercises built into the cover and at the back of the book. Good for teaching colors and animals.
B005GIS1SY|4.0|Great movie for the whole family. My son enjoys playing angry birds Rio. So when he watched this movie he was very happy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The plot was stated early enough in the book to understand the story.  The characters were well defined with a bit of character.<br />I hesitated in reading it because I was afraid it would make me feel afraid or sad.  It was entertaining and not over the top.<br />I enjoyed it very much and recommend it for any book club as well as for individual reading.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game  definitely a great mind thinker!<br />Made me determined to figure out everything and get it right and when I did it was a huge sigh of relief
B005LJETYI|5.0|An enjoyable read. Really liked the way things played out. Was not anticipating such a good tale. Nicely put together..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome I think its really fun ooh can you  maybe send me some more free tokens that would be great.
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|Enjoyed the soundtrack. Wish they had done the whole songs, instead of just the &#34;movie&#34; lengths of them. Worth the purchase.
1781162646|5.0|''A kid on a wheelchair flying a kite on a beach'' this picture has<br />been in Stephen King's head for over 20 years, he let it grown bit by<br />bit and at last we have this story.<br /><br />Yes, there is a crime in this story, but not much blood or violence;<br />yes, there are supernatural events, but not horror or scary. Instead,<br />this story brings back many of my memories, whether sweet or sorrow,<br />and I fell into the story and hard to put it aside.<br /><br />Stephen King has a very strong talent in story telling, I didn't need<br />to use much of my imagination, readings' gone live straight in my<br />head: beautiful beach, lively amusement park, stupid funny Howie the<br />dog dancing Hokey Pokey, and so on so on.<br /><br />I have more summer readings waiting for me, but I decided I am going<br />to let this story keep going around my head for awhile, let the<br />picture of ''a kid on a wheelchair flying a kite on a beach'' burnt<br />into my memory, it's such a nice, beautiful book.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun and educational my 4 year old son and I love to play and learn about new animals and dinosaurs !! He gets so excited when it's his play time
B007FQDPL8|5.0|Great quality - very happy with the blu-ray and it comes with a digital copy of the entire season -
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked it a lot better before it changed. Now it just seems more difficult. It seems like it made it better for its looks rather than the weather part of it.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Just an all around great movie with a lot of excellent characters. Not at all historically accurate, but that doesn't make the story any less great.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|makes you think and analyze, loved it wished it had more floors, but they can always add some later that would be great
0525457585|5.0|The neverending story was the first book i ever owned , it was given to me as a gift from my uncle on my birthday. That was the day i fell in love with books .<br /> One of the most beautiful stories ever written , about a boy and a fairytale land that is in danger because people don't believe in them anymore . Although it was a very big book it was easy to read and it doesn't matter how old you are it's for all ages .<br /> I was one of the lucky ones who read the book first and then saw the movie , which was very good i might say . But the book , the book was magic , i never forgot the story or the characters .<br /> I strongly recommend this book to everyone .
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I use the batteries for a kitchen scale, a rain sensor, and car remote fobs. I have never had any problems with them and I always keep some handy for when they are needed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addictive. has kept me and my family busy for hours. amazing. a never get bored game. keep up the great work.
B009M588K8|5.0|Very nicely written account of what it takes to be a Navy Seal, and the missions they accomplish to keep America free!!  A behind the scenes look; the media doesn't tell you THIS!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing!!!!!!! It is much better than subway surfers. I play it ALL THE TIME. IT IS SO DANG AWESOME!!!!!#
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was one terrific movie. Started a little slow but once it got rolling it was a combination of side-splitting funny and insightful.<br />There was good character development. The story was cut but provided a special glimpse into mental illness.<br />Overall A+.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|My full review would be senseless.  If you don't already know this film, you are to young to watch it alone.  Find some one born before 1965 and watch it with them, you may need help understanding the style of this film era.<br />Warning: this film does not contain foul language, nudity or drug references, you have been warned.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|This disney kiddy has grown into a pretty talented young woman.  This album is going to be a big hit.  I hope she stays sane unlike a lot of other young pop stars.  Good luck to her.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Feels like your at a show- i listen to both on the way in and out from work- beautiful improvs- excellent buy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I looked at all the one star reviews and they pretty much all said it forced closes on my kindle fire. It must have been on a kindle fire HD Cuz it worked perfectly on my regular fire. the only thing I don't like is at some points during the game it glitches up so u die Cu's u cant see but I have had it for 3 days and its only done that once so... I like it
B005C9YZIM|5.0|That's what happens when you watch this. It's awesome, and a must have in everyone's DVD/BLURAY collection.<br /><br />This is a filler sentence.
B00BMT9SQA|3.0|I have always loved Barbra Streisand movies so I thought this would be worth the purchase.  Unfortunately, I don't really enjoy Seth Rogan-type dry humor.  If you do, then you'll probably like this movie a lot more than I did.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good ... just okay.
B00871C09S|5.0|Purchased this for my sis , who said this is one of her fav movies.... She was so excited when she recieved it and from what I have been told, she has watched it several times already.. thanks for having, so I could give a perfect gift.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I really enjoyed the world created in this movie.  There were surprises, and it's much of what you expect from a star studded cast
B000H5TVJY|5.0|This movie was a parody on a lot of things from the 80's with an interesting plot of homicidal fantasies weaved in. Also there is an unexpected ending. Great movie!!
B002PNH46S|3.0|This old film shows Melenie Griffth when was young and very attractive and sexy. Plot was OK, but pretty predictable.
B004FQX5D4|5.0|This movie has the best soundtrack. The movie capitalizes on the whole early ninety's rock and role feel. One of my favorites!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|excellent read!! gear up for an 80's blast. do you remember the video games, the music, the movies from the 80's?
B0016492BW|5.0|This movie has a lot of dry humor. Very low budget props but full of ridiculous antics that will keep you laughing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have read other Neil Gaiman books - I think this might be the best thus far. Loved the characters, loved the concept, loved the story.
B001992NUQ|5.0|This movie is a great modern day cult classic with Brad Pitt in one of his roles as a tough character and not the normal pretty boy role. Edward Norton is just as great as their characters duel it out to create a fantastical masterpiece.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I purchased this dvd because I thought that I had a skip in mine. Come to find out I wasn't missing anything. Still I now have a back up if mine gets really messed up. I love the message behind this movie the most. I'm not really a J.Depp fan but he does well in this movie.
B004UPAIDK|4.0|Do not take this film seriously, just have fun with it! :) Evil Dead 2 must be followed by watching Army of Dead. Just more sillyness to add to the pile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm sure that if it is without any flaws, I'll love it. I like this movie so much that I've read the 2nd & 3rd books and now just about finished with the 1st one. I can't wait until the next one comes out this November. The books of course always have more detail but still the movie was fantastic.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Well, maybe not in MY everyday life, but for those who had &#34;hired help&#34; this give new life to what goes on in the helps everyday world.  Also, you will have a whole new take on ordering or having chocolate pie! LOL
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Let me start off by saying I actually saw let me  in before reading the book or viewing  let the right one in. I loved let me in the atmosphere mood music the  performances made it one of my new favorite movies  but it seems more of a dark fairy tale about vampires who happen to be kids, I put off watching let me in figuring I would not like it as much, after getting a brief hearing of elis theme on the radio one day on a classical station on the radio peaked my interest into opening my copy of let me in on blu-ray which sat sealed for some time.  I opened and watched... I loved it mabey even a little more than the american remake,  the actrees who played eli was as good or better then the one who played abby (motez) oskar was as good as his let me in counterpart.  I thought the score was incredible for let me in and bought it after seeing the film, once again I was shocked at how the score for let the right one in was  even more memorable in parts... a toss up.  I truly loved both films and if I had to and I mean had to Id pick the swedish version over all but it would depend on my mood unlike everyone else I find them to be  complimentary to each other,  am I in the mood for owen and abby or eli and oskar.  Two movies that have had a profound effect on me.  While Im not a huge fan of the vampire craze these two are movies are  about a sad  sweet relationship mixed with horror out of the need for survival,  that happens to involve a vampie and a normal 12 year old kid (you really need to see it to understand)  buy both movies debate them,  they are not at odds with each other and both can be enjoyed and also both scores are worth owning. Incredible films incredible book. The deeper themes in let the right one in are lonliness isolation and pedophilia which are hinted at in the movie ELI never had a childhood  and her meeting with oskar gives her that chance, soem have gone to say the movie is an allegory of the horrors of pedophilia, and this may not be far off, this is the major difference between let me in and let the right one in for me let me in is a dark sweet sad fairy tale about vampire who is a child... let the right one in is a dark sweet fairy tale allegorey about a child whos not or may have never been a child and is all the more sad and heartwrenching my favorite movie and it stays with you long after u see it.is is the major difference between let me in and let the right one in for me let me in is a dark sweet sad fairy tale about vampire who is a child... let the right one in is a dark sweet fairy tale allegorey about a child whos not or may have never been a child and is all the more sad and heartwrenching my favorite movie and it stays with you long after u see it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is one of those movies that you have to watch to the end and discover for yourself what you believe and don't believe, just watch!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The only suggestion I would have is that it would be nice to have a short section on how do you score points and defeat Victor.  Cannot find any pointers on exactly how to progress beyond certain points
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Just as in the first season, the drama continues with historical results!  Of course I was not there, but can believe that the time of the &#34;married&#34; Pope's life has been close to as real as it happened.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|While Carving Desert Canyons is still my favorite album by this young quartet, The Migration holds up as a pleasantly mature exploration of Scale the Summit's signature &#34;Adventure Metal&#34; genre. Notable songs include The Olive Tree and Atlas Novus. Who says a rock band needs to have a vocalist?
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Think you were messed up growing up?  Think you were with the &#34;in crowd&#34;?  Watch and see how YOU most relate to in this telling of personal lives of all of us &#34;regular&#34; and &#34;normal&#34; in the world.  I would encourage younger ages to see, you might be surprised what you will take away from this great movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We enjoyed playing this game, there were many challenges on each and every level.<br />It was very thought provoking. Thanks
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|For all fans of early 1900s British aristocracy and great storytelling!  The estate where it is set is magnificent and is a character in itself!
B009HEJXFS|2.0|This 'franchise' has really gone downhill.  If you expect anything as good as the original(s) forget it, this is a cheap attempt at capitalizing on what WAS a good movie.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|It's Rush so it's amazing, as usual.  Love the tunes, love the artwork, love the band.  It's also nice having the digital copies available on Amazon immediately after purchasing.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|In a day and age when almost EVERY movie out there has at least 3 very graphic sex scenes, and CERTAINLY one or more stripper bar scenes, this was a refreshing change.  They did a great job with 'Paul'.  Fun times.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|It's Rush so it's amazing, as usual.  Love the tunes, love the artwork, love the band.  It's also nice having the digital copies available on Amazon immediately after purchasing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a blast. I cannot stop playing. My husband plays this same as well and he also says it can be very addicting.
B004FPZ2KY|4.0|I love Jane Austen novels and this is one of my favorites.  I watch the movie and read the books periodically for years and continue to do so.
B009P5S11G|1.0|Not only the album sound rushed, but they could at least put the radio version of \\"Pour It Out\\" on there.  Otherwise, the whole cd is garbage, bland, don't make any sense and all over the place.
B00D28TNT6|5.0|F*** Buttons' latest sounds pretty much as I thought it might, given the direction Power's has taken his solo project Blanck Mass in the interim years between Tarot Sport and Slow Focus. The noise is there, but more controlled. The layers are there, but denser and more tightly orchestrated. The electro-beats of Blanck Mass' more recent works, such as the White Mass EP, are replaced by more organic-sounding rhythms, much to my relief. In short, Slow Focus is a logical progression of sound in the F*** Buttons universe, while being neither predictable nor too far gone.<br /><br />If at first you don't get why I gave this five stars, try it again. Buy better headphones. Reduce ambient distractions. The brilliance is there, the way the song structures combine wild chaos and militant order will mesmerize you if you pay close enough attention. I get it's not for everyone, and just as Tarot Sport confounded fans of Street Horrrsing, fans of Tarot Sport may not initially appreciate the direction F*** Buttons takes us in. All I have to say is this: just roll with it. You will feel it, whether you think it is comparison-worthy or not.<br /><br />If you want an eighth track, go get The Red Wing single, which has the B-side track The Whip, an easy addition to the beautiful madness of Slow Focus.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|fits right in to my car bag small light and works well with the serrated edges very nice indeed done
B0036TGSR6|4.0|The movie was okay from what I could tell... when I first ordered this, I got a copy that wouldn't play correctly, it kept freezing up. I emailed the seller and they sent me another copy right away, but that one was defective also. At that point I asked them for a refund, which they took care of right away. I was disappointed not to get to see the movie in its entirety, but the seller provided excellent customer service.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Amazing story line; outstanding action and unequalled acting. A no nonsense bunch to say the least and testimony to how the East was truly won. Heavy duty stuff from beginning to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love it, I love it!!! Could use the update that ios got ,I'm sure it's coming. Addictive and funny
B003P2WO5E|5.0|[...]<br /><br />There really is a reason epic fantasy is called epic fantasy. Everything's elevated to a grander scale that requires a vast amount of imagination and creativity: the people, the story, and, above all, the world. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favourite fantasy writers, and, at the urging of a fantasy-loving friend, I decided it was time to journey my way through the huge tome of \\"The Way of Kings\\", the first installment in \\"The Stormlight Archive\\", which promises to be a thrilling series.<br /><br />It has been centuries since the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant left humanity to fight for itself. Only their Shardblades and Shardplates remain: mystical swords and armour that lend incredible power and near-invicibility to ordinary men. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on the ruin landscapes of the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that has lost all meaning, where ten separate armies fight a single foe, he struggles to save his men and hold onto the one thing that keeps him alive: hope.<br /><br />What makes Mr. Sanderson's novels so mind-blowing is the sheer amount of thought and creativity that goes into them. In the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", you had Allomancy, Feruchemy and Hemalurgy. In \\"The Rithmatist\\", you had, well, Rithmatics. In \\"The Way of Kings\\", Mr. Sanderson has created a whole other world of the Radiants, with skills like Soulcasting--the ability to change the matter of substances to transform them into other objects--and the Three Lashings: gravitational change, binding, and giving an object a gravitational pull. Not to mention the Shardplates, which gives the wearer some souped up superpowers, and the Shardblades, summoned by the warrior in ten heartbeats and able to kill enemies with a slice. Can you spell mastermind? You can see from a glance how much has gone into the world-building in \\"The Way of Kings\\", and, to make a long story short (and trust me, this was one heck of a long story!), everything is simply mind-blowing.<br /><br />Of course, a world isn't complete without the people to inhabit it. The novel is split into five parts, with interludes in between. Each part is told from the point of view of Kaladin, the novel's main hero, as well as from those of either Shallan, Dalinar and Adolin. What I've always admired about Mr. Sanderson's protagonists is that they're never these otherworldly, super mighty people. Instead, they're pretty ordinary in every aspect except for their strength in character. Kaladin is only nineteen-years-old, but already struggles with the guilt he feels over the deaths of those he loves, including his younger brother Tien. The way his character develops as he loses hope and rises again to fight, and learn what is the right thing to do, is so believable every step of the way, and he is truly a relatable character you can't help but admire for his strength and willpower. Shallan, Dalinar and Adolin are all admirable as well, for different reasons. I especially liked Dalinar, who's the moral beacon in the novel, all full of honour and righteousness, even if he has to face disrepute for it. There's so much more that can be said about the characters, and all I think I can squeeze anymore into the review is how subtle and believable their development is throughout the story.<br /><br />The plot of \\"The Way of Kings\\" is, of course, interesting and chock-full of intrigue and wonder. One thing that did hinder it a little was the fact that it did get a little dull in the middle--it was just too long! I think if those parts had been condensed a little more, it would've been more striking and engaging, not to mention more fast-paced and even more intense. Nonetheless, the storyline of the novel evokes action and emotion equally skillfully, while at the same time allowing the author to set up the world and introducehis characters as well. Things get especially exciting in the very last part of the novel, when humongous, world-shattering revelations are revealed and it left me with my jaws dropped and heart thumping! Talk about a cliffhanger. Now I can't wait for the second novel. And that's when you know you've read a great book.<br /><br />Overall, Brandon Sanderson's \\"The Way of Kings\\" is a spectacular first installment to what promises to be a thrilling, awesome fantasy series, with enchanting world-building, believable yet heroic characters and a clever storyline. I highly recommend this novel--and any of Mr. Sanderson's works--for any readers who are seeking a great fantasy book, and I can't thank my fantasy-loving friend enough for introducing me to his writing.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
B004SIP7PS|5.0|This film is funny, emotional, heartfelt, and vastly entertaining, with a cast that was extremely well chosen. Yes,<br />I truly would reccommend it.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is the best book u could  ever read. R.J Palacio really brings you to the book. You have to read this boof now!!!!
B0074PNCRM|2.0|Whilst I appreciate a good cry in a book or movie, I read for entertainment, pleasure and to learn more about this wonderfully crazy world. I would prefer to read a biography or a well crafted fiction piece with twisting plot and complicated characters. I would liken reading this book to visiting a desperately poor third world country, feeling shock and sympathy for the people and then flying home and getting on with my life. Does this book help anyone? Is it uplifting? Does it bring hope and love to its readers?<br />It's a best seller, but it wasn't for me.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is a must see, the adrenaline never stops. The story and performances are amazing for today's standers in movie quality.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Ok I loved the first Evil Dead, this one kind of stuck to the original and this one was WAY more gory than the first if that's hard to believe!!! Lol all in all it's ok but you can't beat the first original!!
B004EPYZT4|3.0|Between the Time when this reviewer drank more than Atlantis drank on the Day of the Gods' Wrath, and the rise of the desire to review a movie negatively... there was a Rage undreamed of.<br /><br />I purchased this DVD as a fun 'whatever' gift to a wonderful person with (presumably) good taste in other areas, who - for whatever reasons - wanted to own it.<br /><br />Possible reasons to own it may include: a view of a gratuitously bare buttoxed Conan (Jason Momoa) in the movie's obligatory 'sex in an atmospherically lit room' scene, as well as a fantastic view of the behind of leading lady Tamara's (Rachel Nichols) bedroom double. Although I'll admit I was mildly disappointed to learn that it was not actually Rachel Nichols performing nude.... still, you can't criticise THAT. I mean, look at that.<br /><br />So we'll give 'Conan 2011' a star for gratuitous shots of female and male buttocks.<br /><br />bing! *<br /><br />And I applaud the director's (Marcus Nispel) decision, knowing that his movie already had a hard R-rating for graphic violence, to show us some of Bulgaria's Most Beautiful Bosoms. Too long have American R-rated movies suffered from a dearth of breasts. I remember a time (the 1980s) when the average movie viewer could reasonably expect an R-rated film to contain at least one gratuitous full frontal shot of Jamie Lee Curtis's or Tanya Roberts' breasts. Then came the travesty that was the 90s, and Jet Li's 'Cradle 2 The Grave' - a god awful R-rated 'action' flick which contains a dance/striptease scene in which THE BARE-TORSOED ACTRESS DOES NOT EVEN TURN AROUND. I should've asked for my money back. For shame, Hollywood.<br /><br />So we'll go right ahead and give 'Conan' another star for its show of appreciation for natural, womanly beauty, and for putting the 'Right On!' back in R.<br /><br />bing! **<br /><br />And for those of you hating on Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) because he's not James Earl Jones, I give you Akhun, portrayed by 6-foot-11, 360lb Australian powerlifter and wrestler Nathan Jones (no relation).<br /><br />It is a proven fact that a giant man who roars his lines, beats his chest in fury, and wields a 'Thorgrim' war-hammer makes any sword and sorcery flick better. Nathan Jones, whose character has lines and who has never gotten his collarbone broken by Cro Cop, gets no billing at all in the main credits; but American MMA guy Bob Sapp, as Ukafa, has no lines at all, yet he gets his name printed on the DVD case AND in the end credits?!?<br /><br />So we'll give 'Conan' another star for Nathan 'RRRRGGHAAAAAGGH!' Jones, to correct this obvious oversight in the movie's credits. IMO, Nathan Jones should appear in every sword n' sorcery and sword n' sandal and Asian martial arts flick, roaring and swinging a ridiculously heavy spiked mace-hammer thing at everybody, because I say so.<br /><br />bing! ***<br /><br />Having said that, I think other reviewers nailed it when they wrote, essentially, 'Take away the name Conan and this movie could be any generic sword and sorcery story.' I don't have much to add to that.<br /><br />In most of Robert E. Howard's stories, the Conan character was almost like Blackbeard without the beard, and (mostly) without the ship. Barbarians and desert tribesmen in Howard's Hyboria followed Conan into battle, not only because Conan's fighting skills impressed them, but because he was their meal-ticket. Conan loved to fight and rarely lost a battle. He loved to steal treasure, to pillage, to captain pirate vessels, and he loved to lead hordes of ravening barbarians and/or howling desert tribesmen against armies of 'civilised' opponents. Conan was mostly amoral, but with his own barbaric code of honour, and he possessed a William Wallace-like charisma with the warrior classes. He spent his gold as fast as he got it, loved the women, loved the booze, loved to party, and it took a twist of fate during a major rebellion (with Conan strangling the despotic King of Aquilonia on hisown throne, and seizing the crown by conqueror's right) to finally settle him down to a life of responsibility.<br /><br />Conan was a criminal vagabond, a schemer, a sellsword and a hardcore killer. Howard's primary concept was pretty far from any notions of 'knightly derring-do' or 'noble savagery,' which was part of what made Howard's Conan 'yarns' so much fun: the unpredictability of Conan. Conan wasn't hampered by the laws and taboos of any nation he visited; he did absolutely whatever he could get away with.<br /><br />At its core, 'Conan 2011' is just your basic action movie. Overall, the stuntwork and the fights are well executed, but a lot of the action suffers from a lack of intensity and craziness and 'total battle chaos' that (in my opinion) ought to be the main attraction in any Robert E. Howard adaption. Some of the action here, unfortunately, feels a little too much like Stephen Sommers' remake of 'The Mummy' (1999), fortunately without the latter's corny humour.<br /><br />Then again, I'm not so sure that 'Conan 2011' was given enough of a budget to create those kinds of battle scenes, battles that could've propelled the movie into that Peter Chan's 'Warlords' or 'Braveheart' territory, which is what any Robert E. Howard adaption truly deserves. It definitely should've been budgeted for that, because why would anyone want to go see a movie based on Howard's writing, where the battle action hasn't been budgeted up to the max?<br /><br />Jason Momoa does his competent best, but all in all the storyline is too generic and the script too weak to allow him to be very 'Conan-like.' Credit is definitely due to this unknown actor (I'd never heard of Momoa before this), who pulls off some difficult Hong Kong stuntman style jumps and falls, that I've rarely seen a non-pro wrestling Westerner perform (because you can really get hurt doing such stunts). It's a wonder he didn't seriously injure himself, since he's obviously not wearing any protective gear on hisarms and torso.<br /><br />And if they ever decide to make Howard's 'A Witch Shall Be Born' into a movie, I believe Marique (Rose McGowan) could easily step into the role of Salome/Queen Taramis, and nail that character to the wall a la Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue in 'The Two Towers.' Although, sadly, I don't think such a film will ever be made, because of the many weaknesses in 2011's 'Conan the Barbarian.' It's a shame that Howard's writing rarely - if ever - gets the cinematic treatment it fully deserves.<br /><br />Final verdict: file this one under `Remakes - Missed Opportunities' and hurry up, because by the end of the 2010s, you might not find any room to file anything else in there.
B009ZQNN90|5.0|This was a wonderfully written, directed, and acted film.  A little of the plot was formulaic, but it's a terrific story.  I don't know how much of the basis in real life was translated into the film, but it's enjoyable on any level, and thought provoking.  I'd watch this one a few more times.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It truly gets to know your style of writing. From your slang, to even what punctuation mark you may use after certain words. I also use the spanish keyboard and it is perfect! Accent marks get placed at the right spot.
0345803485|4.0|Well like everyone else I was so curious to read what all the hype was about. In addition to that, I'm also very nosey. LOL. But anywho, I must say I enjoyed the book. And although a lot of people criticize it for being a light read. I love it because it was a light read. (Short, sweet, and straight to the point). Also, for the rest of the critics, Ms James wrote this story for herself and I can totally relate. I think anybody who has a good idea, should share it. So I applaud her for putting herself out there. She has encouraged me in my own writing.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave the book 4 stars is because, Anastasia was really on my nerves. I mean, some stuff she did was just down right crazy. To me, she did not stand up for herself enough. She just bowed down to whatever Christian said. Anywho, everyone has their own idea of a strong heroine and Anastasia just didn't cut it for me. Overall, I still liked it and when the movie comes out, I will be there !
B007MJSSCY|5.0|great character development, even with supporting roles, emotions realistic and believable w/the topic.  Beautifully done cinematically, marvelous location, wonderful transition between past and present.  Maggie Smith is amazing.  In total, a classic keeper, to be watched over and over..
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best app for pintrest for all those people out there who like pintrest this is the app for you don't waste your time getting on the Internet everytime you want to look at it when you can just push one button and your on but for the app to work you need a pintrest account
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|The classic game, if you love playing it on your computer, than you will probably love playing it on your tablet. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Watched with my 16 and 15 year olds and they enjoyed it too. Good special effects and decent acting. Some may need to watch before showing to smaller children, as there are scenes and suggestions of falling body parts and people getting eaten (non gory).
0545265355|5.0|Fabulous story, glad I bought them all because I sure wouldn't want to be running around to find the 2nd or 3rd book when I was needing to continue reading
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I downloaded this album based on a couple of songs.  Thigh not usually a fan of the genre,  the whole album delivers with genuinely clever and interesting lyrics.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|listened to it more than once just couldn't get into it, even though i kept a open mind when listening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. Graphics are awesome on Kindle Fire. My eleven year old daughter loves it. You train your horse for shows. You can also take pictures of your horse.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|I love any period piece.  This was okay, however, my cup of tea just doesn't extend to ghosts, so the storyline was unbelievable to me.
B00471JSR4|5.0|Excellent film with great scenes with full action, very high  future techno, remarkable visual efects. Very color full and excellent perfomance from the actors.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|son read a ton of the books,  movie was great.  Even our 9 year loved it,  after studying greek mythology in school
B00DU74U74|1.0|This movie has to be the most horrible movie I have ever seen. For me to say that about a movie made from one of my favorite books should say a lot. I honestly want my money back from the people who wrote the scene play, the special effects, and the lousy actors. I endured the first Twilight movie and still see some of its short comings almost parody like and enjoyable. This was just BAD!  I found nothing enjoyable about this film. It murdered the book! I could go into very long detail of about a thousand things wrong with it. Reading the other comments, I have seen it has already been done.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|this is the greatest Action Movie of modern  times, the movie was very thrilling and fast paced. this movie should be in every one collection that likes military history.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|I am not going to write a review. Takes too much time.<br />I do not feel this should be REQUIRED in order to rate a movie
B005544V6A|5.0|Not for everyone. It's a show you can watch on repeat. There is such much character development, and the plot and story line is always unpredictable.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|My book club chose this because of good reviews. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. It was like Groundhog Day without the humor. Parts were simply boring and repetitive, with an ending that was not surprising. I will say that, it kept you going wondering where it was going, but overall it was really a drag.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Everything works except the paper cover placement holder was tarnished and worn on the edges. Film is great and works like a charm.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I often do not have an internet connection when I like to read books.  Unfortunately, a connection is required to open this book.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Jack Reacher is what a lot of people would like to be. Always ready to help and with no ties to get in his way.  Lee Child makes these stories fascinating  and this is one of the best Jack Reacher books I have read. I could not put it down
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Bit schoolboyish and shallow.The previous two were more engaging and had better plots. I think Jeffrey Archer has done better
B001F63D66|5.0|One of the best movies ever lol, love every bit of it. Use to watch this all the time. Now I own it and can watch all the time
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I have to say I was aprehensive as to the quality of this show, but after watching the 1st seaon I was addicted. Great character development and great overall plot lines make for a great watch. Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have played this on pc and xbox but the bad thing about this is the updates come late :c
0307271080|5.0|Iam yet in the throws of this wonderful book,its captivating and interesting.I highly recommend this to anyone that's ready for a great read...
B00846REIS|5.0|I felt that it was hard to put down and i cant wait for the next one hurry up please
0345529057|5.0|I had ordered this set as a gift for my sissys birthday and it came in the day of her birthday and she was very very happy, therefore making me a happy customer !!!
B0091VTISO|3.0|Pretty good time waster for a rainy Saturday Afternoon but that is about it. There was lots of action and special effects<br /><br />; )
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Definitely one of the best thrillers that I have ever read in my life -that's saying a lot because I have read dozens of the years. This book is right up there with some of the biggest titles on the market. The story instantly hooked me in, within the first chapter I was already deep into the story and had a hard time stopping. The writing is excellent, the author does a good job of keeping up a captivating story with just the right amount of mystery to keep the reader intrigued from start to finish. I am very impressed with how well the characters fit into the story also, I feel like every one of them belongs and has their own significant part into how the story plays out - there really isn't anything I would change about this book if I had the option.<br /><br />Time Killer is the definition of a good, suspenseful thriller.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Average, Thats all I can say. I like Tom Cruise's action movies, but He is getting old. No offense Tom!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great and it basically needs nothing more. The only thing would ask is if you could get more coins for the activities and stuff.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|my kids loved the movie and the theme. it was a nice, feel good movie. I love Steve Carell's accent in the movie.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book really can capture your attention as well as impact the way you think. Greeeeaaaaaatttt rrreeeaaaddd! A biblical stand point might have improved the book though
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|On first listen I was a little disappointed because it didn't &#34;rock&#34; very hard, but this is one of very few albums (from any band) I want to listen to from start to finish. They might have individual songs that are better, but this album as a whole is great.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|If you are using a kindle fire, you can get this app for FREE. When you first get your Kindle Fire you will see it already has apps in your cloud, just not downloaded. One is an email app. Once you download it, select your email website, and put your account on it, BOOM! You get everything. The app appears in your carousel (duh!) and you just tap it and you can see your email. Amazing right? The email app your Kindle Fire comes with is way better than this junk. So DO NOT BUY.  :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is fast paced with an easy to follow story line. Characters are easy to love and hate. Mike is the one to follow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse game me and my kids love it couldnt get any better and it never frezzes
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is an enjoyable game for all ages. It is worth every cent and has alot of levels(and there are more to come.)
B008YKGQR4|1.0|it glitches out. wont let you click on what you want, it makes it seem like calibration is off. it sucks but cant find a good full version, so i only use it, well rarely.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. I CRIED AT THE END LIKE A BABY! I<br />CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH! A GREAT LOVE STORY, BUT SO EROTIC AND SEXY!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This is the best show ever made and all of the actors in this show are perfect for there role, it is so believable
B00B97SNJI|3.0|I so loved their last album (I should say, in spite of \\"A Little Bit of Everything\\") and had seen some good reviews, so I bought this one, too.  It just feels a little mealy-mouthed.  I think maybe the lyrics are the worst part.  \\"Hey Lover\\" is so grating to me, I literally cannot stand to listen to it.  None of the songs are loveable to me.  Bummer.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was a great read for me as I also recognize that you have to think outside the box and connect the dots. Whatever ideas you are totally positive about, is to give it your best shot and you might see New dots connecting you to make something better or worse... loved this!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|if your kindle says it does not have enough space deregister it and then register again. then try to download if it does not work do it again till it does its worth it
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Love is often crazy and stupid, but also wonderful when it's right. These guys finally get it right. Really like all the characters.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Not impressive  it won't even load in my own house and it takes forever  please don't buy this app it's horrible
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a very well written book. It draws you in from the first page and is a wonderful examination of people's motives and emotions. I can understand why people who were expecting another Harry Potter experience would have initially been surprised by the difference in tone, but certainly it is just as well written and I think more interesting than the HP stories. It's simply a more \\"adult\\" examination of the world.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I enjoy it more than I think I should. It's quite the guilty pleasure for me, and I generally avoid all shows on MTV. However, this show's heroine got me hooked. She's likeable and relatable. The other characters are just as interestingly weird and funny. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to watch short episodic shows.
0399162097|5.0|I'm almost afraid to say a word about this novel's plot thanks to a person who's been sending negative comments to everyone who reveals the basic concept of the book.  I will, however, warn animal lovers that you may encounter descriptive sections that will disturb you.<br /><br />The author has given us a great picture of a family with one unusual member through the eyes of Rosemary, who was the most affected by an adopted \\"sister\\".  There's a lot of humor, love, and heartbreak here and it is a book well worth your while.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|I've tried using this app but keep having issues. Every time I open the app, the pre-done lists reappear. If I delete them they come back. If I don't delete them, another copy appears EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP! How do I fix this? Otherwise this app is useless!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like temple run then you will love this game!!! It is basically the same thing!!!! I suggest it for all temple run lovers!!!!!-
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its not the best game and it slowed down my device. but it is kind of fun.<br />if you really like minions bananas and slow devices then you should download this app
B005HESLUA|5.0|Like the original, the important thing in this series is the story and not so much the science fiction.  Good moral values are hidden gems for the most part - so what if the special effects are a wee bit dated!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Completely love Pinterest! its great for getting fitness ideas and has helped me change my diet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone although it can be addictive... :)
1452101426|5.0|Lovely book and a definite for those who love to see the process and evolution of an animated film. As a bonus the book itself is excellent quality and great edition to your bookshelf. I highly recommend it.
B00BOXZAJ8|4.0|We saw the trailer and really enjoy what it showed, thankfully we weren't disappointed. Its a great Saturday night movie to cuddle up and watch
0811875555|5.0|Lovely book and a definite for those who love to see the process and evolution of an animated film. As a bonus the book itself is excellent quality and great edition to your bookshelf. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  It was a fun, quick read that kept me guessing until the end.  I definitely recommend.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Acting was great. Story was believable and had good ending. Scenery added much to the story line. Enjoyed the entire movie very much.
0553386697|5.0|> Dan Siegel and Tina Payne Dryson's book, The Whole Brain Child, is a resource you won't want to be without.  It's crammed full of information and helpful explanations of children's behavior based on how their brains work.  The book is reader friendly and translates complex neuroscience into clear understandable language.  The authors explain how children's brains are different from fully mature brains.  This is specially important for understanding young children who are right hemisphere dominate, especially during the first three years.  Emotions rule and they live in the moment.  They're unable to use logic and words to express their feelings.  This book helps us remember how important it is to help them by listening to them with our own right brain.  Tuning in to their emotions first will allow them to then be receptive to reason and logic.<br />> I recommend this book highly for not only parents, but for anyone who works with and cares about children.  It's a resource that gives you the knowledge you need to make your interactions with children more successful.  It will also allow you to help them better integrate their emotions and their intellect.  Peggy Kruger Tietz
B00BESM14U|1.0|Could be that I am not the right age to be intrigues by this movie. Could only stand content for a very short time
B007WPM4P0|5.0|Beautiful, actors, beautiful acting. I fell in love with the movie and have watched twice after watching it once, I decided I wanted to own it.......bought it!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show keeps your interest from beginning to end .  The show has enough twists and turns that you can never be sure of the ending.  I love it!
B005S9EJ46|4.0|The story brings interesting perspective to the issues faced by aging people in a world that seems to devalue them and juxtaposes it with the optimism of a rapidly changing India.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product. It's mostly eliminated my need to long cables. The streaming is flawless, and the installation is very simple. The only shortcoming is that it doesn't stream local content (files you have on your computer), but I understand that's a technically harder problem to implement.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I like the fun characters in the film. The &#34;invasion&#34; of space villians sets the stage for our unlikely heroes to find their inner mojo and save the world. The comic moments can be broad, but are always endearing.
B001FQIWSK|5.0|Cinematography was stellar.  That little girl was really cute and I hate saying the word &#34;cute&#34;.  I would watch it again.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|I prefer literary fiction. This is definitely not it. I usually force myself to finish a book, just in case I might miss something. But I stopped at 2% on my Kindle.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Renner is a great person to take the lead on the<br />Bourne movies, talented and believable actor!<br />If you havent seen it you should give it a try!
140006922X|4.0|Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth is a very interesting read. It puts the word of scripture into a historical context and provides much needed background for the stories of Christ that we hear these days. Aslan is a great writer and I urge you to check out his other books. Many are crying a foul that he mixes faith with history in this book, but he also presents Islam in a historical sense in No god but God.<br /><br />Both books are definitely worth a read, whether you believe it or not.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game, very addicting. Only issue is that it is a bit slow to load, and I don't have much on my Kindle. Recommended for those who don't mind the time suck or those who need a distraction for an hour or two. Love the minions :)
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love how easy it is to use.  It reminds me of Disk Clean up on Windows only the presentation is better for some reason.  I can't really articulate why it is better.  Probably more information on what I'm cleaning out.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Finally!!! Bought it on sale for $27 here on amazon.1 of the best trilogies I have seen in my 37 years of living. Of course The Lord of the Rings is the best of them all.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Initially I thought I had downloaded it.  When I went to my apps, it didn't show up at all.  I tried to download it again but it kept telling me I have it.  Well its not there.  Its messed up somehow.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|James Bond at its best! No more outrageous out of this earth high tech gadgets, just plain old guns, goons and beautiful girls!
1250006341|5.0|This was a gift for a friend who said that it was excellent. He is an enthusiast of this show.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It was entertaining &amp; just challenging enough to be fun without driving you crazy. Looking forward to next one. Thought it was a lil pricy but ending up with it.
B0024CEY36|5.0|I never thought that Ken Follett would ever write another book as good as &#34;Eye of the Needle&#34; but &#34;Man from St. Petersburg&#34; comes very close...........
B009MXSWI8|4.0|I recently rented Evil Dead (2013) not knowing about the original.  As a horror fan I don't know how I missed the original.  Overacted and gore and blood ahead of it's time.  A must see for any true lover of this genre.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Again, if you've actually read the trilogy, you realize this isn't quite it.  Still, this is a motion picture and as good as technology is, there are still just some things that can't be done on film that can be accomplished in one's imagination.  Yet, you've got to give them an \\"A\\" for effort, and they turned out a very nice movie.  The story goes along smoothly, though there are a lot of things that are NOT \\"by the book.\\"  I won't attempt to list them.  I'll leave that for you to do when you watch this movie.  Do I recommend this movie?  You bet your last pair of socks I do!  As I said before; Tolkien it's not quite, but it is very, very good.  It has the action and does carry the story though, as I've said and you'll learn, there has been some \\"artistic license\\" taken.  Still in all it's a great flick and I do give it five stars.  I think you might do the same.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was really fun to play this game. i played simular games but always get frustrated because they 're made to hard. this game was fun, i had to think but it was still easy enough to figure out. im really sad to be done already... i want more :)
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I think this is the best in the series. It also answered a lot of questions and explained away some &#34;coincidences&#34; that were in the first books. I highly recommend this book but not before you've read all in the series up to this point.
B004SIP86Q|5.0|loved everything about this movie.  Kate Winslet EARLY ON.  Hard to believe the craziness some people can come up with
B001KT6JPA|4.0|This is an interesting chapter in the story. It is worth the watch if you liked &#34;Silence Of The Lamb&#34;.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|I enjoyed this very much. As told from the perspective of &#34;Joey&#34;, it is light and entertaining. An easy read.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|this is by far the best documentary I have seen for food. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this film! very inspiring!
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Good movie my kids and I love the picture. The turbo car is funny and If I could say more I would.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|They've changed the program to these kiddish icons that look like something a first grader would draw. There's alot of worthless videos and some stupid points system offered. I thought I would give it a bit to see if it would grow on me but I'm starting a search for an adult version of a weather ap. The old ap was fine. Wish they hadn't changed it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great Book about a Great Person. The book has a spiritual message that we all need to hear. My heart goes out to the family of this great American.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Very addictive, nice graphics for the kindle fire hd. Sucks when I run out of money though.. the little worker doesn't go fast enough.. lol!
B008OOYALE|4.0|SUPER FUN but.... it tries to rob u by doing pop ups on new dragons to waste it gold so u gotta tap carefully other than that SUPER FUN add me my storm id is Marie1015
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was written for my generation.  If you were born in the 80's and grew up with video games, this book is for you!
B001RUXW48|5.0|Leonardo is a great actor and this movie proves it.  I watch 100 s of of movies a year and this is one of the best action movies I have ever seen.  I went into the movie blind never seeing a preview and watched it twice the first night.  I have seen it several times since.  BTW I watch either streamed or dvd.  Rarely do I goto the movies.  I like to be able to hit pause, rev etc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was the easiest purchase I've made on Amazon. I'm glad I broke down and bought the season, it was well worth it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book. A light read that constantly made me laugh. I loved her writing style and her wit.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Too bad they cancelled - we are all VERY disappointed!!  Love, love, love this show!!!!! Always entertaining-music, drama and comedy!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Wonderful , well written book. Well worth the time to read. Really will get you thinking about a a lot of possibilities.
B005VMSATA|2.0|this was not even entertaining. Quite disappointed. I would not recommend this movie unless there is nothing better to watch.
B00846REIS|3.0|Story line is just not as gripping. Guess I was looking for it to be more like Shades of Gray. If you like novels with descriptive, explicit sex though, you will probably enjoy it.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I read the Godfather again after almost two decades and found it just as scintillating the second time around. 1950's New York, the politics and the dynamics that create and foster crime are fascinating. Add to it the human drama of family and love and a dash of Hollywood and you have the perfect recipe.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Big fan of Downton Abbey. Season 3 doesn't disappoint.  I haven't recvd the DVD yet but as soon as I purchased it, it was immediately available on the Amazon Video Library. How awesome is that!
006178480X|5.0|Jim, you did another great book<br />I highly recommend this as a good read!<br /><br />Jim... Obviously you haven't flown from Asia to the USA/CA often because it takes more than 6-8 hours.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|aswome game i like it lots it is addicting you will keep on playing it for hours and hours peace out
B008UX2UIO|3.0|...yes...but...it remains stagnant in its absurdities. It did keep me reading but<br />I think it was out of curiosity as to just how insane are the characters.<br />Its like Jerry Lewis doing a prat-fall. Funny the first time but if he keeps<br />repeating the stunt it becomes a bit weary.<br />Remember that this book was rejected so many times that the author gave up on its publication possibilities...and then...it wins a Pulitizer??!! Wha?  This book is given rave reviews by many and panned by others. Very strange indeed.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I pay bills on line so its easier to have my kindle right there with a calculator, instead of trying to switch back and forth on my computer
B007THA4FI|2.0|I became tired of the story - it was slow and depressing to see people be so ridiculous and cruel in their dealings with each other.  After getting past the halfway point I decided I'd like to know how it ended, so skipped most of the rest of the book and read the last 60 pages.  It filled me in enough on what I didn't read and gave me 'closure'.  I was glad I didn't spend the time on the rest of the book.
B00BVYR6YW|5.0|This is without a doubt the best show ever. Who knew one actress could be so talented. And FELIX is my favorite person in the world.
B007N85POS|3.0|IT loses something with no pigs. The settings are darker and hard to see.. Overall Rio is  not my favorite.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice. Game is nice. Difficulty level impressive. Took some time to figure out some things. In all it is a very captivating game
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game! Def worth the money! Nice combo of point and click with HO game. Play it peeps!! Plays well on kindle fire and graphics are superb.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This was my birthday present to myself. The quality of the DVDs were very good. They do get stuck sometimes during play.
B00008G7UF|2.0|While the movie was visually perfect I had to turn my volume up to 100 in order to hear what they were saying, and no I do not have a hearing problem. I will most likely find a copy of the movie in a dept. store and try again.
B00DMM3WVM|3.0|Is an excellent game just glitchy  Pauses all the time or won't load have erased and reloaded app with same results  fix these issues an I would give 5*
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great for netflix and youtube streaming. I look forward to future added functionality. Pandora was promised to be available soon, and I would also like to see a Hulu and and HBO Go added to the list.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I think is is a very neat app so if you have goals maybe chors or going shopping it would be very helpful you should get thise app it's is really neat
0786838655|5.0|The book was in the condition that the ad described.  It was definitely worth the money.  Thank you for this book.
B0086700CM|3.0|this game is a pretty cool game but sometimes it gets old I think you should make a third temple run that has more features. thanks! :)
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|The movie started out well but really dragged on after the first little bit.  The cars were cool and the idea behind the movie was interesting.  I did like the ending however.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Another one of Nicholas Sparks movies brought to the big screen and as usual it is so good. I love his books and when they decided to make a movie from his books I knew they were going to be good to watch. I read his books over and over and now I will be watching his movies over and over. He is an excellent writer. Beautiful movie.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|I just love John Malkovich.  He never disappoints me.  Great action.  Funny.  Helen Miren is amazing and I just wish I looked half as good as she does.  Both my husband and I loved this movie and will be going to see the sequel this weekend.
B007SSF3O0|3.0|If you like Gwyneth Patrow, you'll like this. She does a great job with the accent and with carrying at least 90% of the dialog.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|When I ft this app I expected it to give me a password but it didn't just a bunch of random numbers
B000G2AHUA|5.0|Perfect Shoes as I have before. This is the third pairs I have.<br />Recommend  every one try this shoes.<br />You'll love this shoes. Trust me.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Always liked the app before. A bit hard getting used to, but now I like it even more.  Keep up the good work.
B001N8Q6V0|5.0|Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. Four Score .and seven years ago
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|When I got the app it froze.I could not even play and I had the app 3 months.<br />Trust me don't get the game.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|It's  alternative hip hop with a touch of 808s and heartbreak. I didn't really care for on sight or send it up but the rest of the album is pretty solid.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great Bingo game...a fun way to quickly pass time and I love the fact that you can play slots with this app too.
0811879542|5.0|This could make the reader seem so much more clever.  Put a little person in your lap and let the fun begin.  Even preverbal children &#34;get it&#34; .
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I love this game!! It's so addictive and you get a feeling that feels like a rocket blasting through you!! You should play this game. :)) :+)
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|My wife and I are Musicians and we really enjoyed this movie about a retirement home for retired Musicians in England.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is truly amazing I recommend it to everyone<br />I absolutely loved everything about it<br />I rated 5 stars because it is probably the most amazing book I've ever read.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|We went to Paul Anka concert in Las Vegas many years ago and later went to another concert in Houston. Both shows were extremely entertaining. He performed for at least 2 hours and gave us our money's worth. Most people don't know that he has composed many famous tunes over his 50 year career. Tunes like &#34;My Way&#34; done by Frank Sinatra and &#34;She's a Lady&#34; by Tom Jones just to name a few. On this record he sings with famous singers where Paul wrote the songs. It was fabulous. The one exception was the duet he did with Willie Nelson which was &#34;Crazy&#34;. Paul did not write that tune, WIllie did. My wife and I really love this album.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I was hesitant to rent this due to to the kiddie nature, however, I often find myself repeating corny lines to my friends. This movie is a must for all ages, especially if you are a fan of animated movies. Don't expect PIXAR quality stories / graphics / animation. That said, the voice actors are great and they expertly capture character emotion and expressions.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just Ordered this Item today.<br />No Tax,shipping and 3 months of netflix makes it a slick deal.<br />Only drawback of this piece will be any local contents cant be viewed directly onto tv.<br />But 11$ for this device...I cant be any more choosy..
B00COHIFQS|5.0|WOW!  What a great movie!  Watched this with my daughter who loves scary films and she really liked it.  She said it &#34;wasn't what she expected&#34; in a good way!  I was impressed that this film was developed from a short film of the same name.  It inspired Guillermo del Toro to produce it into a feature film.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be thrilled, but wants a good back story supporting the plotline.  The child actors in this move are beyond their years and do an amazing job!  WARNING!!  VERY SCARY ELEMENTS IN THIS FILM!  NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good. great. love. fun. hppy. excited. cool. awesome. fifteenth, but like temple run. better than temple run. ok.my first love.
B007H746AY|5.0|Such a well acted and excellent film!  Kathy Bates is phenomenal in this film, and James Caan was well cast as the tormented writer.  I always thought this movie would make a great play.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|I like these flip cover cases and this one for the HTC One from AT&T worked really well.  It adds enough protecttion without being too bulky.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|This is a great app that I use every single day to keep up with a number of blogs. I'd highly recommend it.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|For those who enjoy the shopaholic series, you will definitely like this book. It's got the cuteness and needed drama to get you through the book fast. I enjoyed the book very much and can't wait to see what Sophie Kinsella will come up with next.
B00441E2R8|2.0|This must have seemed like a good idea to its designer, but functionally, this watch is practically useless. Forget about checking the time in a low-light location. The day and date displays are so small and dark that they are almost invisible. I have reasonably good eyesight, but I had to set them using a magnifying glass under a lamp with a bright halogen bulb. If all you care about is design, then buy this watch. If you actually prefer a functional timepiece, you'd be better served looking elsewhere.
B00064ADR0|5.0|Excellent recording.  Have some of this on vinyl.  Saw Johnny Winter live with Rick Derringer in the band also at the old St Albans civic hall in 1970.  Truly great performer and a good evening of rock & roll and fast blues music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not usually into this sort of program but the story line takes precedence over the 'zombie' atmosphere.  It's interesting to watch how people might survive in extreme circumstances.  While unrealistic at times, it is very entertaining. :-)
B000008LH5|5.0|As I already had purchased the same album on vinyl in 1973 on the Chrysalis label I knew that it was good.  Having seen Ten Years After live in small clubs and at a big venue in 1969 and 1970 and on their 1989 tour at Hammersmith Apollo this album is a true reflection of their live playing. A much better live album than the one produced off of Ric Lee's (the TYA drummer,) tapes recorded at the Fillmore.  My 13 year old daughter and her friend came to see them with me at Hammersmith Apollo in 1989 and they were both astounded at what a good band and good music was like compared to the bubblegum POP they had got used to. Changed her musical tastes forever so far.  She still has her Ten Years After tee shirt.  Very sad that Alvin Lee died earlier this year. He really was the front man and the soul of the band.
B00006IU73|5.0|And definitely not my last. Came to Porcupine Tree via Steven Wilson's great 2013 album and will not stop here. Love it.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|The only thing wrong was they stop making it after it 5th season. Which I watch all 5 seasons before the request on how I would rate season 1. Enough said.
B004Q731RM|5.0|Better packaging, terribly scant liner notes, marginally better sound on the original album, amazing bonus cuts...I think it is. This version, used here on Amazon, is cheaper than I bought the original for, so I considered this one a no brainer. The album proper still sounds ethereal and quite unlike any pop album if ever heard. This just makes it that much more better.
B00A6RCSKC|2.0|I download this for my grandson and what I type is his opinion of the game.  My grandson said it was better on the computer.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|Just traded my old CD version for this remaster and it was worth it for a) the massive upgrade in sound, b) the wonderful and complete liner notes and vintage photos in the worthwhile booklet and c) the bonus tracks, which are sparse but always interesting. This has always been my favorite APP record, for sentimental reasons most likely (was the first I heard, etc), but most of the songs are still first rate in my opinion. Still retains a hint of that old prog rock, especially in the concept, and way before they went off the rails (from Ammonia Ave onwards), this is a good addition to anyone's music library.
B00CUWKHVI|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars, but the take on Cole Porter's &#34;Love For Sale&#34; is only describable as &#34;Horrific&#34;.  &#34;When I Get Famous&#34; is addictive; so have fun.
B00168HARG|5.0|Delivered in time stated.<br />New, in packaging.<br />Plays.<br /><br />This season warmed up to me pretty well. I thought it was a good show with a pretty good story. The writing was really good, as the acting and action.
B0026KX6TY|5.0|All parents want their children to be successful.  Great story of a boy with exceptional talent and compassion for others.
1449325947|4.0|I have read the whole book and it really improved my CSS skills. I learned a lot of CSS before but I still found a lot in this book and it also gave me a systematic understanding of the concepts about wed design and development. It is very theoretic and practical and it is just worth the money.<br /><br />The only thing I may complain is that the tutorials are a little too simple, but they are also useful.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I've played minecraft a lot so when I tried this demo I was expecting the same ease of controls.  There are lots more possibilities with this game. I like the more realistic appearance. But the controls were just not as free flowing and fun to use. Too bad they couldn't merge both games!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|If you love Marilyn and music,dance you will love this show. Makes you want to get up and dance and sing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great action movie, and even if you don't really care for action movies, this one is so well acted, so funny that you'll love it!
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Bob Marley at his greatest. I could listen to him all day long, his three little birds, bring one love to Mr. Brown, who keeps on moving, without fussing and fighting, in Trench Town.  He is the legend with the sun shining at the cornerstone of riding high who will always treat you right.<br />Now don't rock my boat, just buy this and become a soul rebel.<br />Jah
B002VWNICW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies to watch when I am alone. Love the story, love that it is NOT traditional.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|perfect on my several players.<br />Like new--maybe put in old case to seem like used.<br />Really,  the case was like new too.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals, love listening to the songs, as much as watching the movie, great buy!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I love science fiction. There is never enough. I saw the original Alien in AZ on a triple screen! This does not begin to touch that, but you take what you can get. It is dark, so adjust your contrast, and look out what is behind you.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I was going to see Red 2 and wanted to watch Red again to refresh the characters. Love the action!
B001202LRM|5.0|I suppose this isn't a bad thing. I think they are better musicians in general in comparision. Jonathan's a little more whiney in general and tend to focus much on child-parent experiences. While Slipknot's a bit more abstract.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed the book, as a single young woman with a strong career, it gave me insight into thinking about my position, and not feeling guilty or that I should be doing something else because of society...
B000053ZRR|5.0|CD is great!  Bon Jovi is the best and I am very please with the tracks on this CD. WONDERFUL!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I couldn't agree more with other reviewers how this went from a 5 star app to a1 star. Please revert to old format
B003M70O5O|5.0|It's hard to not watch the whole season at once.  Very very engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Game is great. Only problem I have found is the game freezes after a while. And you have to close out a couple times before it will unfreeze and work correctly again, but otherwise graphics are good and goals are not too bad
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Usually, books are better than movies, but not for this particular one. I never felt pulled into the story because the main character 'spoke' like he was a dimwit - not one who's struggling with a disorder or dysfunction.  Movie did a way better job of portraying the story.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Was a gift for my daughter who loved it. Arrived in time and in good shape. Can always depend on Amazon!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|This is a decent product but fails my test because it is only available on my android phone.  A very good (IMHO) task program allows you to see and edit tasks on a computer as well as a phone or tablet.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app does not work well at all it constantly says it has a problem so it stops. Not happy its easier to login through the web.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was just wonderful.  The author has a deep love of India and the reader feels that love on every page.  It is almost as though the main character is &#34;India.&#34;<br />The narrator is a New Zealander who has escaped from prison in Australia and who has a dubious past.  We first meet him in Bombay as a newcomer and see his progression as a person as the book continues.  He finds, as his mentor, the head of the mafia in Mumbai who is also a philosopher and a very learned man.<br />The plot is excellent, the characters most interesting, and there is a wonderful joy of living throughout the book.<br />I highly recommend Shantaram as a one of a kind novel.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This series is addictive from the very first episode.  Marvelous acting and interesting plot lines that are updated versions of the classic stories.  A must-watch.
B00006RCOB|5.0|Clint Eastwood is GREAT whether in front of the camera or behind it I would recomend this movie it's a great additional to any collection!
B00942Y0TM|5.0|Short, simple and to the point.  Another battle won against good and evil with small hints of life lessons learned.
1594203334|1.0|I am a nurse practitioner that works in pediatrics and read this book while my breastfed infant (now a breastfed toddler) was four months old. I have never written a review, but felt compelled to warm mothers that this book is full of horrible advice, especially regarding infant feeding (particularly breastfeeding). First and foremost, you can NEVER compare the sleep/wake cycles or feeding cycles of a breastfed baby to a formula-fed baby. Because french culture shuns breastfeeding (red flag number one), the french concept of \\"learning their nights\\" is not applicable to breastfed babies. Breastfed babies WILL wake up at night to feed because milk production is higher during the night.<br /><br />One positive about French parenting represented is this book is offering a variety of foods and enhancing the palettes of older infants and toddlers. This concept is something that many in the American culture could aspire to. Shockingly, one would think that the French culture would be more open to breastfeeding since the flavors in breast milk further enhance an infant's palette. There were a few other parenting pearls embedded somewhere within the pages, but not enough to waste your time wading through the author's insecure ramblings to find them!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is a fascinating book, and will appeal to males and females of all ages.  The stories of the characters will definitely touch your heart
B0089IGUP4|5.0|A great rock album the likes of which you don't hear much of any more. To me, it's like someone mixed Springsteen & The Clash. Well worth having.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Really enjoy this game.  Like the story<br />line and complexity and the fact that you can 'friend' others in the game. It is a great boredom buster.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Some of the songs are a little disappointing; I thought I would like the Michael McDonald song more than I did I've never liked &#34;Fever&#34; no matter who does it, but this is mostly a good duets album.
B004GJYROG|5.0|The DVD is exactly what I ordered and still in its original packaging and was great quality too! Shipping time was quick, I would definitley reccomend this to my friends!
0399162097|5.0|Whatever book you are reading now, put it down, close it up, and read this book.  It's excellent!  What a great author!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It keeps you thinking ahead and changing your plans. It really reminds me of a game I knew in my child hood on the first Apple. Now that my He is showing. Try it you will like it.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|The songs here are all fantastic--not just the &#34;My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark&#34; that's all over the radio.  Great purchase since it's priced right for a short cd.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Bruce still  has it in this film and shows it no matter what his age. You go Bruce! Keep making these flicks.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was enjoyable- kind of predictable- good girl meets bad boy- girl's love fixes bad boy. But the story is compelling and worth the read.
B009ZE27US|1.0|The app repeats the same ages and I knew this was going to  be a rip off but didn't think it was this bad
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I enjoyed this book- it was written a few years ago but it is a story about the government having access to our private emails, phone calls etc. It seems like it was telling the future, as that is where we are today. Dan Brown is an extremely gifted author.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Such a great show! Never seen such a great adaptation of an alien invasion. It's like Walking Dead with aliens!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A well written, sad but uplifting tale from Irish history. Hard to believe this is as recent as the 70,s.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I love this author and while all of her writing is dark and twisted, this book was especially gut wrenching. I almost couldn't get through it. Good read but be prepared.
B00A9Q70Y4|5.0|This is a GREAT show.  Lots of drama, zombie action, and apocolyptic feel.  Watch it. You will not be disappointed. In fact, i bet you'll thank me. :)
B004LROUNG|5.0|This story was refreshing in that no one was murdered.  There was the death of a child that was such a needless tragedy.<br /> If only companies  we're as compassionate as the toy company executives were in this book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to my granddaughter who became a Grisham fan at the age of 12.  She is a young lady now & hasn't had the free time to read over the years, so will tell her to get back into Grisham.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|the BEST of Grisham.  After bashing lawyers for profit he saw the light and the damage done to the profession he loves, so Grisham now writes these wonderful uplifting stories and all profits go to the Innocence Project!<br />Good job, John!  you are redeemed!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I loooooooove this CD, it took a minute to grow on me, but I love it.  This is the future of music.  &#60;3
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|My son encouraged me to read this story. It is a great story of a family that struggled with some major issues in life. A family that relied on the Christian church in the midst of its struggles. A marriage that endured in spirt of many challenges.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|I saw this movie origionally on my 13th birthday and just knew that someday I was going to meet Robert Redford (Hubble) and marry him.  A classic!
140006922X|3.0|This book is very much mainstream &#34;the real Jesus&#34; sort of book that has been published for the last 30 years. Follows Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, and The Jesus Seminar main lines of thought and writing. Also the demythologyzing was raised in the early 20th century rather completely by the German theologian Rudolph Bultmann.<br /><br />Since Reza Aslan is Muslim what this book does is present a very cogent and clear picture of the last 1,000 years teaching and tradition about Jesus from the Islamic vantage point.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for the whole family!  We absolutely love playing the Despicable Me Minion Rush game.  Action packed without the violence.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|I did not encounter any problems with this order.  It arrived promptly and my granddaughter will really enjoy it for her birthday.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|I also purchased Home DVD from Australia for $13.00 incl delivery and noticed it included reference to Climate Change<br />I am concerned that the copy from USA although an identical DVD made no reference to Climate Change but emphasized the photography.<br />In order to save the planet we need to make more people aware of the causes of climate change. Keep up your effort to provide<br />valuable information through the books and DVDS
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This funny look at teen life and love also has plenty of awkward moments, so the title is well-chosen. Well worth watching!
B008MR1PDE|4.0|I have tried many music players, and this one is very accurate in creating album art. The sound quality is good and easy UI. Keep up the good work.
B000P0J024|5.0|Absolutely the Best performance from ALL 5 Entertainers. George Harrison and  Roy Orbison's Legacy. Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne.  Best of the Best....
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A life time of fun. Keeps you captivated. Love building the reefs and acquiring new fish. Looking forward to what's next.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Makes for a great night of rest and wonderful whitenoise. Definitely a great buy totally worth the price just get it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like how the dragons look in the game compared to some other games. Also you can earn everything in the game instead of having to buy it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was such a fun game..Loved the challenge of it..my only problem was that i wish it was longer..i didn't want to stop playing..i hope they are more of these games in the future!!!
B00C2IGQEW|5.0|not only is this one of the best movies ever, but this bluray steelbook is awesome. I personally love not only movies, but the design of their packaging and this case is sweet! I strongly recommend it!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I'm a late Glee bloomer but I love the show! I was missing out over the last several years. Trying to catch up before the new season starts.
B00BB67UNW|4.0|This was a very good movie. I'm a big fan of Mark Walhberg, I love all his movies. Russell Crowe was also very good in this movie. I'm becoming a fan of his after watching this movie.
0307744434|4.0|This book pulled me in and didn't let for about the hundred pages or so. Somewhere in the middle it began to drag, and then all of a sudden it drew me in again. I really think this is a great book and hope for a sequel. By the way, the Night Circus will not tell you where they are going next. I e-mailed them.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This was a really good movie. It was better than I imagined it was going to be. I wouldn't recommend it for children to watch though. It's not the nursery rhyme I remember, it was better!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I have all the Dr Panda apps...free and paid for. This supermarket app is a lot of fun for kids ages 3-6. Kids can follow a grocery list and look for items in the market, stack boxes in puzzle form, check prices which helps with number recognition, and make coffee for fun. There's so much more to explore in this app. I don't normally opt to pay for apps for my kids. But for $1.99 it's actually a sound purchase. My kids really love this app and we actively look for more Dr Panda apps.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This movie is brilliant! It's funny, full of action, Arnold is amazing, he's very cool as well. I've watched it 2 times already and I will watch it again. I recommend this movie to all Arnold fans:)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was hooked from the first show of Season One and it hasn't let me down right through to the end of Season Three.<br /><br />I continually find myself siding with a character, and then against when the next drama erupts.  The characters run the gamut of emotions from likable to despicable and just when I think &#34;fire the monster,&#34; they do something to redeem themselves and you forgive them their iniquities.  It makes for a very 'believable' cast.<br /><br />Needless to say, &#34;Love it! Love it! Love it!  Hope it goes on for many more seasons.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|And this one is not to mine.<br /><br />Persuasion is such a beautiful book, and the 1995 adaptation so true to it in spirit, mood, rhythm and plot, that it was hard to imagine why we needed another. But of course there will always be another Austen adaptation - we have Pride and Prejudices, Emmas and Sense and Sensibilities coming out our ears.  And in another 5 or 10 years we'll have a new round, with the next generation of young actors.  So be it - Shakespeare never gets old either.<br /><br />This adaptation has all the right costumes, locations (ah Lyme, ah Bath) and superficial manners (we bow our heads politely) but that's about it. To compress the plot into 90 minutes much was left out, rearranged, or invented. Instead of the exquisite scene where Wentworth overhears Anne speaking to Harville, she tells him directly that she's not engaged to Mr. Elliot, and then (as so many have already said) chases him all around Bath.<br /><br />Rupert Penry-Jones may be a good actor, but here he's just used for his chiseled, if bland, good looks. He has two facial expressions: pained, and 'in-love'. We don't see Wentworth's humor and good spirits, his intelligence, or even much of the rapport between him and Anne as it reestablishes itself over the course of the story.<br /><br />Hawkins - just, no. Her mouth quivers and gapes, she weeps, she staggers and sighs - this is not Anne Elliot, this is not any Austen heroine. It's a stereotypical bereft maiden. The final kissing scenes were so dreadful I had to literally turn away from the screen.<br /><br />The other characters are stereotypes too, with no nuance. Elizabeth is screechy, Sir Walter is shouty, Mrs. Clay is simpery, Mary is whiny, Benwick is gloomy, and so on - everyone has one broadly drawn characteristic.<br /><br />Just one woman's opinion. (And to decide if your tastes align with mine so you can decide whether or not to take my review as guidance or with a grain of salt: Love both the 1995 and 2005 P&Ps but ADORE Matthew MacFadyen; Favorite Emma is the 2009 with Jonny Lee Miller, love Sense and Sensibility '95, and unlike almost everyone, I love Mansfield Park '99 - I think it's beautiful.)
140006922X|2.0|I, like many, have seen some video excerpts of interviews with the author and was intrigued.  However, after finding out the author is Muslim and not an expert in Christianity, my interest in the book has faded.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|I've missed this kind of app since I retired my Palm and it works great for quick notes whilexstopped at stoplights!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The USB cable that came with the Kindle was not charging my device anymore. It was loose in the port and when I could get it to start charging it was just a trickle and would take up to a day to fully charge the device. This Micro-USB cable has a slightly larger connector. And that solved the problem. Using this cable and the Kindle PowerFast, I can now fully charge a depleted Kindle battery in under 2 hours. No more having to adjust and wiggle the original USB cable trying to make a secure contact to charge.
B00AL6SM0S|3.0|Wagner dwarfs all other composers and I love the ring and see it live every year. I own about twenty complete sets and just love to listen to all of them mainly for their differences. This one lets me hear some of the past great singers. The quality, because of the age of these productions, is not good. If you are going to learn the Ring this is not the set for you. If you already have developed Wagner ears, comparing Rings is a lot of fun and educational, for Ring Nuts such as I.

B00CATSONE|5.0|I downloaded because it was free and Tesla has always interested me.  A nice surprise to find a little gem of a book with Tesla's life story quicky encapsulated within some basic encouragement and good advice.  Glad I read it and have already recommended to others.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is truly the best! It is both so REAL and yet so mystical as its characters jet to the other side of the world in Jaipur chasing a dream. There, despite their unorthodox existence, each one discovers that \\"wherever they go, there they are.\\" In discovering this for herself, Judi French leads Dev Patel to defy custom and follow his heart. I will watch this over and over, hoping to absorb more of each character and the gorgeous surrounds of The Best Exotic Hotel. An exquisite film!
0553801473|2.0|I raced through the first three books in a few weeks, loving each and looking forward to the next as Martin kept the tale spinning from high point to high point. I spent a month of on-and-off slogging to get halfway through book four (A Feast for Crows) despite the well-chronicled tedium and conspicuous absence or near absence of several favorite characters. I have given A Dance With Dragons a week of steady reading, and found myself skipping whole sections (including a trip to the near-end out of morbid curiosity), wondering why formerly minor, uninteresting characters were now major, uninteresting characters (I'm talking about you, Ser Kevan) and generally regretting my purchase. Chronology has come unhinged. Page after page details the details that only the most fervent fanboy will appreciate.<br /><br />I've recently become hooked on the HBO series and admire how deftly the show usually handles the need to consolidate story lines and characters, but the screenwriters have their work cut out for them by they time they reach this book. So for now, I'll leave the text behind, finish Season 3 of the series, wait anxiously for Season 4, and hope that Martin finds his way with the next release.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Somewhat confusing. Had to use hints often because items so small. This is a good game if you just want hidden objects only. I enjoy more of the mystery-storyline plots-minigames-hidden objects. Like Letters from Nowhere. For a beginner this could be ok for $2.99.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Really good combination, I wasn't sure what to expect when they put these two together, but it really worked great.  I could really see her as his mom.
B0012QVJXS|3.0|Saw this movie when it came out and a few times since (Superman II was my go to for Reeve-Era Superman movies). Watched it again recently and was surprised at how uneven the whole film felt. Hackman, Reeve and Kidder are a real treat to watch, especially when playing against each other. Reeve plays two roles here, and knocks 'em both out of the park. However... the movie indulges itself too much at times, veering between genres (Dark comedy, Action, Trippy Sci-fi) with abandon resulting in an uneven tone throughout. The effects are good for the time, but don't hold up as well as other effects-heavy works of the '70's (Star Wars, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, . However, some of the effects in the climax (a miniature town, Superman in lava) are just plain awful compared to the quality of the rest of the film. Again, an uneven tone.<br /><br />Overall, still a classic and a must watch for superhero fans, if only for historical awareness. Also, the superhero movies of today owe quite a bit to this film and its sequel. I doubt that any of them would have been as good had Richard Donner not showed us that drama and superheroes could exist on screen together.
B00BR1EZ3O|5.0|The transfer was excellent, the film is vintage Eastwood, I loved it. It bad universal doesn't release some of it's other great films on Blu-ray like the action film Streets of Fire.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is an incredibly powerful film. However, when I first began watching it I thought, &#34;Why did I buy this?&#34; By the time I finished watching it, I thought, &#34;Why did I wait so long to see it?&#34;<br /><br />Every now and then a film that deals with the up's and down's of real life can make you laugh one minute and cry the next. Quartet certainly fits the bill!

B0072IVGZG|4.0|It was,in my opinion,like most music from the Cult.Quirky enough to not be Mainstream ROCK ,but too Heavy to be Alternative.And that is what I LOVE about the Cult. Here's a band that never sold out to the &#34;Glam-Rockers&#34;But kept the Faith, and played the Music they were known for. I know if I don't listen to them for 10 years,and buy their newest album,It will be The CULT .PERIOD. They are like Motorhead,& Black Oak Arkansas.You got 3 separate Genre's of music there,but in this,they are the same.They stick to their guns & they Keep that Faith,because they know what their fans wanta hear! And,It Just So Happens That's what they Wanta Play!!! THE CULT ROCK ON!!!
B001RHOJSE|3.0|This  is a controversial book. I could of read it many times to understand all that the author was saying. I think she was right and wrong in her assessment of Eichmann.  The banality of evil is not a monster but an everyday person who gets caught up as a cog in a wheel of a machine. Eichmann was one of an ordinary person who was following a law and not breaking a rule. I disagree with the<br />portrayal of Eichmann in this book. He was a German Nazi who willingly took actions to murder people that did not fit \\"The Nazi Aryan Type\\". While I believe it to be true that there were many Germans that did fit \\" the banality of evil\\", Eichmann wasn't one. He knew what he was doing and took pride in his day to day duties of organizing transportation of mostly Jews to their deaths in concentration camps.

B008JFUTT0|4.0|The start of the documentary seemed disjointed and a little confusing to me. It was as if the show started with the pretense that we knew whom this artist was.  I had never heard of him for some reason.  But as the pieces started to come together I was completely drawn into the life of this hard-working artist-musician.  Now that I own each of his albums and listen to his songs weekly I cannot believe he was not accepted in America.  His voice is wonderful and his songs insightful of the times.  His &#34;belated&#34; fame abroad makes it seem like there was a little flame burning that kept him alive, albeit in foreign countries, and without his knowledge.  Although he was not embraced in the great USA makes it seem that he was perhaps not accepted for being Mexican-American (?) ... even during those early years.  His life is truly a feel good story -- that hasn't ended.  I'm so pleased he is alive and able to enjoy his justified fame, instead of being discovered long after passing away.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a beautiful story. Page be page the history of a family is revealed and the reader is swept along wanting more at every page turn. The prose is lyrical and soul touching.
B0040UEI7C|5.0|There was certainly no lack of talent in the opera world in the 1970s, and this magnificent recording stands in eloquent testimony to that fact.  Aida is often performed and often recorded, and most opera fans will have their favorite performers of this great Verdi opera.  I would be hard pressed to come up with a \\"best\\" Aida, or a \\"best\\" Rhadames.  We are just lucky that this recording features many truly first rank artists caught at the peak of their vocal powers.  And a great conductor at the outset of his distinguished career.<br /><br />Montserrat Caballe was truly at her best in the 70's, and her best has to be heard to be believed.  While many would not consider her the ideal Aida voice, she more than rises to the occasion here and reveals a lush, rich voice with power to spare, capable of spinning out Verdi's long, passionate lines with ease.  She apparently seldom had to breathe, and chooses spacious tempi which allow her to really relish every phrase.  She is great in the big arias, but perhaps even better in the ensembles, where I suspect some well chosen miking may have helped out a little.  But she's best in the many duets in this opera.  Her long scene with Amneris is stunning, as is the Nile scene with first her father, then Rhadames.  She is positively seductive when coaxing Rhadames to flee Egypt with her, and her ravishing voice simply scintillates as no other I've ever heard.  Her incredible soft singing, showing many different shades of soft from p to pp to ppp to a true pppp simply has to be heard to be believed.  And what tone she uses as she holds onto these soft notes until they seem to detach from her throat and hang suspended in mid air somewhere over her head ... like a glistening crystal bubble spinning in space.  I have never heard anyone do this before, not Muzio, not Gencer (although she came awfully close), not Milanov.  The effect of these splendid pianissimi raises the hair on the back of my neck and quite literally takes my breathaway.  I've seen Caballe do this in person, and I know that this is NOT the effect of a little over engineering.  She really could sing like this, and still be heard in the back of the house.<br /><br />Placido Domingo is also heard here to wonderful effect.  He was in superb voice and easily rises to the many challenges of this great role.  His big moment as he surrenders his sword after helping Aida and her father escape is, indeed, very big.  His voice rings out effortlessly and would have been a real showstopper in the opera house.  But perhaps his greatest achievement, and it is incredibly great, is the superb Tomb Scene that ends the opera.  This is Verdi at his finest, and in the hands of Domingo and Caballe I felt as though I was hearing this music for the first time.  Both separately and together, they are both simply amazing.  But the final phrases of \\"O terra addio\\" are simply, undeniably exquisite.  Domingo at times in this scene is singing in full voice, expressing his distress at finding Aida buried alive in the tomb with him.  Caballe answers him softly, magnificently, calming him, caressing him with her voice.  And in the final lines, unexpectedly and with great effect, Domingo suddenly softens his voice and matches Caballe's radiant tone nuance for nuance. Hearing both of them caress those final notes while Cossotto intones her prayer for peace from outside the tomb ... well, you'll have to hear what they do with this music yourself.  This is great opera at its absolute best.<br /><br />And Muti, well, he's simply inspired from start to finish.  I suspect he knew how great his singers were in the recording studio, and he gives an expansive reading of the score that allows them plenty of room to work while at the same time propelling the drama along in all the key places. The ballet music is wonderful, and the power and drama of the great Triumphal Scene with its vast cast of characters is truly compelling.  This scene is one of my favorites, givingeach character something to do as each expresses their own thoughts while all are singing together.  It's Grand Opera at its finest, and Verdi's music here is among the finest moments of opera I've ever heard. This is big, big sound, all clearly recorded and each voice clearly audible.  While I still couldn't say what recording is \\"best\\", this reading of the score is certainly one of the front runners.  I don't think you'll be disappointed with anything in this Aida.<br /><br />Cossotto is, as usual, a solid and moving Amneris.  Her voice is well known to most opera lovers, and she is in characteristic form here.  She knew this role well, and performs it admirably.  All the male roles are equally well done, although I could have asked for a bit more bite and contempt from Cappucilli in the Nile scene.  He's telling Aida she's no longer his daughter, and is just a slave of the Pharoahs.  You get some ire here, but not quite the total denouncement for which I'm looking.  I mean, he's being deliberately manipulative at his point, afraid he won't convince Aida to betray her lover. I would like just a bit of overacting and sheer DRAMA at this point.  I get just that from Caballe's response to his words, as she is very much in character throughout this entire scene.<br /><br />The recording is well engineered, and a delight to play really loudly on a good audio system.  It will give the best system a real workout, and make you glad you invested in a system which can do this dynamic performance full justice.  Whatever your preferences for Verdi opera may be, you owe it to yourself to hear this reading of Aida.  Great Verdi, great singers, great conductor, great orchestra.  It just doesn't get much better than this.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|A great bad taste comedy. If you do not like immature jokes I would stay away. If you loved Borat then you will also love this movie.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This was a great movie with lots of twists and turns.  The cast was wonderful.  I love Matt Damon as villain.

B00DU74U74|3.0|She was annoyed with parts because she read the book and movies are never what your imagination made the story to be and I never read it and was confused with some actions and dialog because it was chopped up. Decent flick but not worth a second watch.

B005ETA5K2|2.0|Going to try and leave a helpful review for potential buyers. One of the reasons this item is attractive is because of the Mac OS support it offers, when compared to other Alfa products. Another reason, the N band compatibility. And third, packet injection.<br /><br />As for the osx support, it works nicely. Although there are a few caveats.<br />1. You have to use the 4in stock antenna. Tried it with some larger ones, and reception was way worse. More importantly, shifting the antenna direction by as little as 1 degree can cause a signal drop of 20%, meaning you need to align it perfectly when connecting at range.<br />2. Low Power, stock drivers only allow it to operate at somewhere between 100-500mw range, not the full 2W which is only legal in Bolivia (strange, isn't it?)<br /><br />N band compatibility: Haven't had any luck yet. Been unable to connect to an N router in Linux, which leads me to my third point.<br /><br />Packet injection/reaver/KisMac/Linux Distro's...<br />It is not kismac compatible, but I don't use kismac. As for Reaver and Packet injection, it doesn't seem to be supported in reaver 1.4, nor be able to hold down a steady enough connection for injection/cracking. In fact, I would go so far as to say it's completely useless in BT5 r3, although there are a few drivers you can install (which isn't novice territory for those of you using YouTube videos and are unfamiliar with linux). I've heard rumors that it works out of the box in BT5, and it does. As long as the router is sitting on the same table. Add some distance, a wall or two, and you're better off with the AWUS036H (Which is NOT supported in Mac 10.7.4&#60; or able to connect to N routers).<br /><br />Final Thoughts? It's cheap.. works in latest versions of OSX... and if you point it in a perfect direction, it boosts signal although fluctuates in signal strength like crazy. Other than that, I'll be buying the AWUS036NHA for running in Linux. Might even return this one :/
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read in a VERY LONG TIME!!!  What a well written book - five stars...what more can anyone say?  I want more, more, more!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is one of a kind. It is not really a story as it is more of a life lesson. A book that makes you see the world differently is rare. The character's thoughts are so deep you can see right into their soul, and sometimes you may catch yourself thinking you are really there, or even that you ARE the character. It is not a book you can simply blow through as a time-passer, but one you have to take the time out to read; a book that is for people who enjoy reading. Many of the ideas in this book will stay with me.
0345529057|5.0|A great series, and a really nice set. If you don't like the tv tie-in, then I wouldn't purchase these, for the box has some show characters, and the covers have HBO advertised on them. I don't see why it really matters though. As long as you're enjoying the literature, it's no big deal at all. Mine came neatly packaged and still in the plastic. Excellent.

140006922X|2.0|The author makes the assertion that the Gospels were written after the Jewish revolt and subsequent destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. for a Roman audience that had become very intolerant and belligerent toward the Jews.  Therefore, Jesus' followers had to make Jesus less a zealot and less a Jew.  They hoped to attract followers by hiding the very political, angry, anti-Roman, pro-Israel Jesus behind myths, distortions and specious lies.  At least, that is Aslan's claim.<br /><br />In fact, there is no contemporary evidence that Jesus was anything other than what is claimed in the Gospels.  There is much speculation otherwise that even began as early as the time Paul was writing his epistles.  Such ideas gained wide popularity evidenced by the Gnostic writings in the second through fourth centuries.  Aslan picks up where the Gnostics left off and Mohammad began.  His theories are pure Muslim boilerplate that has been around in one form or another since Mohammad.<br /><br />If it could be proven that the Gospels were written prior to the destruction of Jerusalem Aslan's narrative disintegrates.  Consider the magnitude of the destruction of the temple to the Jewish people:  it would have been the most unthinkable, terrifying, horrifying event that a Jew could imagine. The temple was the center of the universe for Jews and the very seat of their god,Jehovah.  Its destruction would have been almost tantamount to the end of the world, and it is impossible to imagine that the writers of the Gospels and the letters of Paul and others would have failed to mention this event were they written after 70 A.D.<br />The complete absence of any reference or allusion to this destruction makes the assertions in \\"Zealot\\" precarious at best and futile at worst.

B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Shipping as expected took a few weeks, most of the time it was sitting in &#34;customs&#34; in NYNY. Less than a week to get to New York from Asia, then sat in New York at the customs warehouse, once released from customs, a few days to get to Ohio. Arrived in perfect condition, nice box, manual, warranty book and of course the watch.<br /><br />The watch seems to keep perfect time, glad I don't have to deal with batteries anymore.<br /><br />Bought the watch to replace a Seiko Men's Diver from the late 80's (quartz). I loved that watch also, but didn't like changing batteries every couple years. The SKX007K is perfect for me, slightly larger than the quartz model, better shaped bezel to protect the crystal, thicker case, larger day/date window and still has the classic watch face. My original watch I used for diving back when people actually needed a dive watch to compute repetitive dives on dive tables. I doubt I'll need that function on this one, but I'll still wear it diving without fear of destroying it.<br /><br />I have never liked the rubber wrist band of the Seiko divers, but nylon bands only run about 10 dollars. I put the rubber band from this watch and put it on my old Seiko diver and dropped it in the dresser drawer. Maybe one of my kids will wear it, but for now they call it &#34;Old people Clock&#34;...

B0068MNO4S|5.0|Of all the Elizabethian films in the past 30 yrs, this production has to rank on the very top of the list.  Of course some of it was theater ledgend, but most of it was remarkably correct.  I do not intend to cover all of these points, but let the veiwer do that for themselves.  It does give the audience a brief snap-shot of the life during what would be considered and is considered,today:  the The Golden Age of Elizabeth I.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a magical, mythical read, not to be missed.  Through the highly effective use of myth and fantasy, Gaiman draws me to a consideration of the concept of a home ever-lasting, where the spirit is saved, soothed in a time of crisis and one's hunger is simplified and satisfied with a slice of bread and butter.  Of course, there are malevolent forces to overcome and a sacrifice must be made to redeem an innocent--but isn't that what we do as we slay our daily demons and would do for our children?  If a universe may be found in a grain of sand or drop of water, then there may be an ocean at the end of the lane.  And if it's possible for an ocean to be there, home may be there, too.
140006922X|1.0|...and there's not a thing anyone can do about that. This book is another attempt to distort the intent of the original writers of the Jesus account. Whatever anyone says about the nature of the Gospels as narrative witness and whether we should accept them, there can be little question about the intent of the Four Evangelists, summed up neatly at the end of John: \\"These things are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you might have life in his name.\\" We may accept that, or we might call it nonsense. Another option is not granted us if we choose to use those documents--which constitute a bottleneck for historical research into Jesus of Nazareth--as our source.<br /><br />If you want some good sources on the Gospels, I recommend Martin Hengel's /The Four Gospels and the One Gospel of Jesus Christ/ and Richard Bauckham's /Jesus and the Eyewitnesses/--both top shelf, world class European New testament scholars.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|A dramatic, heart-rending account of the struggles resulting from 18th-century land swapping in colonial South America between the Spanish and Portugese, the behind-the-scenes politics and economics involved, and their disastrous consequences on the innocent natives in the area, who became the victims, as seen through the eyes of Jesuit missionaries who were political outsiders.  A major issue is the practice of slavery by the Portugese (openly) and Spanish (covertly) landowners, who held major influence on the European politicians, and who, for economic reasons, promulgated the view that the South American natives were not humans, but human-appearing animals, who, therefore, could be property.  The film honestly and humanely portrays the genuine humanity of those simple people and the disastrous consequences of their becoming entrapped in a greedy and powerful European economy, as well as the utter futility of the idealism of the missionaries in confronting worldly mechanisms.

B00DU74U74|4.0|The book was way better .. it was a bit slow and boring at first .. But, I stuck it out ..till it finally picked up a bit .. not sure if having read the book helped or not .. a good teen film .. not very interesting for an adult ..
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|The movie was REALLY good , but the emphasis on putting the blame on ALA was a bit of a stretch and retrospectively unfair.I did really enjoy it though and if you have been reading about the zodiac killings , this movie will bring all that to a better understanding (somewhat) .I felt it would have been a GREAT movie if it had included the other possible suspects.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and very addictive, however, it does require a tremendous amount of patience if you are not willing to shell out actual dollars. And I do mean SERIOUS PATIENCE and that is why it does not get the last start from me. But otherwise it's very good.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I always wanted to have all the saga, now i have it, and it looks awesome, BR is the best
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book is very funny and I am enjoying. I am not really a fan of Saturday Night Live but interesting to hear about the behind the scenes.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is exactly what is stated in the title: an oral history. It is made up of dozens of interviews with survivors of the fictional World War Z (for zombie).<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Zombie Survival Guide or The Remaining series, you'll probably enjoy this. It does tell a story, with a beginning, middle, and end, but does so in a slow series of steps and in so many voices that at times you can believe they were written by different people.<br /><br />If you are looking for an easy read about zombies, though, you will miss so many details here that you will be left unfulfilled. This book requires a careful read, and will reward the effort you put in.<br /><br />One last thing, referring to the Kindle version. This may be obvious to highly computer-literate people, but to others it will be a revelation. There are many superscript numbers in the book that refer to the Notes at the end. At first I made a bookmark every time I clicked for a note, then used the menu to find my bookmark to return to the text. The publisher, though, was smart enough to make the entries in the Notes hypertexts back to the text again! That means that you never need a bookmark to find your way back to where you were reading; just click the number of your Notes entry and you'll be taken right back where you were. Brilliant!!
0743270754|5.0|A well written book, using excerpts from diaries, newspapers and words of Lincoln's day, that gives us a view of Lincoln that we missed in school.<br />Lincoln is more amazing than I imagined. I was so into the story it was hard to deal with Lincoln's eventual death.
B000SGRONM|5.0|It is a great book that is awesome and funny and fantastic and super and clever and terrific. Sedaris rules!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictive game. I love the minions so I enjoy the game. The one thing I wish the most is being able to play offline. I dont't have 3G on my kindle fire and I don't always have wifi access. Otherwise it's a fun game.
B00AYB1KHW|5.0|Just a well written story filmed perfectly and acted with what is now mostly big talent.  Fun movie to watch and see how many faces you can recognize before they were well known.
B00A6VYX3I|5.0|Video and audio were great and just an all round good movie. Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah all turned in strong performances so very early in their careers
B008469DGY|5.0|It has become my go-to time filler.  Whether you are a golfer, or not this is fun.  Very challenging and intriguing.  Enjoy!
B0000CDJPQ|4.0|I have not tested it long enough to know if it will last. It looks well built and works. Macbook Pro to storage devices.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I have really enjoyed all of OneRepublic's music that I have heard so I just had to buy this album for myself.
B008ALAHA4|2.0|I've owned this product for about 4 months now and am lowering my rating.  On a 15\\" Retina MBP this adaptor gets hot.  It also doesn't seem to make a very solid connection.  Any slight pull on the cord will stop and restart the charging, and it's not a fault in the cord of my charger.<br /><br />I understand the cost savings in using existing chargers on the new magsafe 2 laptops, but the heat doesn't make me feel comfortable using this product.<br /><br />I don't see trying to save less than a hundred dollars while risking a $2k laptop.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|not really a gamer, no instructions or hints available for use.<br />waste of time and space on my kindle and in my mind
B0091W9GQM|4.0|As usual great audio and video, no feed problems and almost anything with Johnny Depp is going to be good, he was in fine form on this one.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Generally I like what ROllins writes but this title was just lacking.  I read it to the end but found it difficult to finish.  No doubt in my mind his earlier stuff is much more compelling.  Very average!
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|The best movie ever!  Brilliant dialogue disguises exposition that deepens and expands the hero's journey to a loathsome territory he thought he'd escaped from long before the actual story begins.  Corruption and wealth meet an unrelenting gumshoe, and the results make for an unforgettable movie experience.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It helps me sleep so much better I normally cant sleep because its to quiet but now its no longer too quiet
B001GJ3BPU|2.0|It was actually worse then I remembered.  The movie was very cheesy overall. Nothing like superhero movies of this decade.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Never could get the hang of how to play it, and frustration is not what I need right now.<br />Maybe another time I can try it out again.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|This is a true Die Hard movie in that there is a lot of action and some humor all throughout. However, that's really all there is to keep the movie going. I am a fan of the Die Hard movies and I did like this one, but it wasn't the best. I think they are starting to run out of things to do with Die Hard and it shows. However, the action scenes were what you'd come to expect, so I rate it good, but not great.
B00DU74U74|3.0|The movie follows the movie but leaves out many of the details that explain the Seeker's obsession with Wanderer, which leads to Wanderer's ultimate decision (won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book).  If you read the book, you will know exactly where this movie is going. The ending is a little different, although broadly the same.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|Most science fiction movies are little more than shoot 'em ups, a la Star Wars.  Real sci fi deals with bizarre ideas.  In the first Star Trek movie, the crew comes up a force built entirely on an idea -- a device sent into space to gather data and then, when it's gathered all the data in the universe it returns to earth to find its creator.  What a great premise for a science fiction movie (though it was based on an earlier TV episode).  Such a premise draws in the viewer to learn how the crew of the Enterprise must deal with this idea-gone-grand.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is so incredibly addictive and fun. Basically, the wilder your imagination is, the more fun this app will be for you. It was certainly worth every penny spent. I hate that you have to spend ANOTHER 99 cents just to get more levels, though. Other than that, this app is pretty much flawless.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|It's pretty funny, especially Fat Amy.  The lines from the commentators made me laugh.  I found the scene where the girl was lying in puke...pretty gross.  I don't think they should have added/created that part of the scene.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This show is soooo addictive.  Leads to zombie nightmares but still worth it.  My favorite other TV shows that I found to be addictive in this way are The Wire, Rome, Pride and Prejudice (BBC), Luther.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|First of all, it shows how to do a level so fast, you can't figure it out.  I really thought I was getting the game itself. Very disappointed.  I play candy crush saga on the computer but on my Kindle it's not available.  So, when will it be available?  I am sure there are other people who would like to know also.
B0055QYKQO|3.0|I built a new computer and unfortunately ordered this Gigabyte MB, and an EVGA (same company) graphics card.  First off, the physical devices are working just fine, so I can't give them a negative review.  My beef is with the customer service department, their totally non-existent help, and general apathy.  When I ordered these two devices, they were offering a rebate ($10 on this MB and $20 on the Video card) and that actually factored into my purchasing decision.  That was my first mistake.<br /><br />Rebates are generally customer hurdles that companies make very difficult to fulfill, so they can deny your claim and keep your $$.  This was exactly what happened here to me.  I very carefully, and very professionally printed what was needed, cut the appropriate UPC's from the boxes, stamped and mailed them back to EVGA/Giga.  All in all, it took about an hour to do this, so it's debatable whether it was even worth the $30.  A few weeks later, I received an email that my claims, both of them, had been denied.  There were multiple reasons, every one of them bogus.  I'm sort of a technophile, and I build myself a new computer about once a year.  I've probably used at least a dozen EVGA/Gigabyte products over the years, and I explained to them that losing me as a customer over $30 wouldn't be a wise business decision.  I honored their requirements, now honor them.  What did I get in return?  Auto reply form letter!  To make a long story short, I decided to be an annoyance about this (I'm going to cost them $30 in some way) so I started writing an email a day and calling their customer service # a few times.  They stuck to their general story, and denied my rebate claims.  Finally after getting escalated, they agreed to honor the rebates.  At this point, I'm 5-6 hours in total, so at this point it's not about the $30 anymore, it's principle.<br /><br />So...a few days later (nothing is quick with them) I got an email that ONE of my claims had been honored and I should receive my Amex Gift Card for $10 in 8-12 weeks.  Because it takes 12 weeks to mail something.  There was no mention of why one (of the two) claims had been ignored.  FML.  I hate this company, and that's that.<br /><br />TDLR: Products were actually just fine.  Just hope and pray you don't deal with their customer service departments.eceive my Amex Gift Card for $10 in 8-12 weeks.  Because it takes 12 weeks to mail something.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|A well written summary of the events leading up to the financial crisis, told through the eyes of several interesting characters who saw the train wreck coming and managed to profit from it. Lewis is an excellent storyteller whose writing keeps you engaged from beginning to end. The book tackles a complex subject that can be difficult to follow at times, but I learned enough to conclude that the right people were never held accountable and the wrong people ended up paying the bill.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This movie surpassed my expectations. It is a must see for all dads sons moms and daughters. It is very good. It gives hope to the society we live in.
0785132619|4.0|Really bloody, really naughty and really, really funny. John Romita Jr's claret-splattered artwork is perfect for Mark Millar's lean, punchy storytelling. Arguably, the film adaptation upped the ante and created yet more iconic images, but this is a short, sharp burst of brilliance that's a must-read for any self-respecting comic lover. And even un-self-respecting ones. Probably especially those.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As always Jeffrey Archer spins a great story. The way he develops each character over so many years is terrific.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a really long long time. Wow! Colleen Hoover hit this one out of the ballpark.<br />I'm still trying to recover from all the emotions this story stirred in me. There was not a dull moment in this book.<br />I was on my way to Michigan to see Pearl Jam, reading on the plane and I had to stop and change books because the emotions were too hard to hide and was threatening a really serious ugly-crying session.<br /><br />I was a little weary when I started reading, I was afraid it would be the high school love story that while sometimes nice it can also become predictable and cookie cutter.<br />Hopeless was anything but predictable or cookie cutter. The lives of Sky and Holder completely take you hostage and make you laugh, cry, want to throw the book across the room (but in a good way), and some other times you just feel like rocking in a corner<br />There was more than one time where I literally had to put the book down because I was so afraid of what was coming and though I desperately wanted to know I was also desperately afraid that my heart would break into a million pieces and not recover for days.<br /><br />Holder is just amazing, I mean he could be the ugliest boy on the block (which of course he isn't, he happens to be the hunkiest one) and it wouldn't matter because his soul is the most beautiful soul I have seen in a lead male character in a while...<br />Sky's story is one that truly can hit you hard, probably harder for some than others...it's a heartbreaking story that gets very real and makes you angry at the calamities that some people have to face in life.<br /><br />It's a story about love, friendship, loyalty, the ultimate betrayal, self-sacrifice, and more than anything... Hope... Every main character has a story and a past that haunts them and when it all comes to light it feels like someone punched the air out of you leading you to the most emotional conclusion ever.<br />This is one of those stories that will remain with me for a long time to come, until I revisit it when reading Losing Hope ...<br />I absolutely recommend this book, you will first LIVE it but then I guarantee you will LOVE it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|we enjoyed this move Reds 2 this summer yippee!!!! well since i have to make eleven more words i will say rent this movie
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Yes, this is the continuation to Fifty Shades of Grey.  Besides the storyline moving along, the relationship between Christian and Anastasia becomes pretty stagnant.  They become more &#34;in love&#34; but their love life is basically the same as it was in the first book just written a different way every time.  It's quite monotonous and was a rather boring read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is very fun but it is a little slow but still very fun I love it and recommend it.
B00783NWB6|5.0|What can I say, If you like the Underworld series why not buy it in the 3D version movie also.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I was one of the few that missed the first Downton Abbey train. I have watch season one and two and am now almost through season three. It was very convenient to be able to get a streaming video through Amazon. No complaints except I wish they would allow for month-to-month renewal. That was the only reason for four stars instead of five.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great read!! I enjoyed this book, it was hard to put down. Kate Morton is becoming one of my favorite authors! Love her stories and her characters stay with you.
1423140591|4.0|Not a bad sequel to the first novel involving Jason, Piper, and Leo.  A good read that ties in Roman and Greek mythology together in a modern sense.
B0000025D0|5.0|My review's title says it all. If you haven't heard this album, you have no idea why Springsteen has so many fans.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Get it.<br />I love it.<br />It is very fun.<br />It is the best.<br />I am a kid and I love it.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Cool gadgets, great fights, hot girls, awesome weapons and vehicles. It has  some corny lines & they killed duke! Nuff said!!
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Nice to have a Bluetooth enabled iPod with this little gadget.<br />Only problem is, as others noted, your battery will last 1/2 as long.<br />But a good compromise in my opinion.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Few people can weave a complex set of events into a suspense-filled tale which keeps one on the edge of their seat throughout. Plus, this storyteller has a superb cast in the likes of Cary Grant, James Mason and others. If intrigue and mystery are your fare, this is one we recommend. You will certainly enjoy it as much as we did.
140006922X|4.0|Like many of the reviewers, I have not yet read it. But the author presents a fascinating, well-argued, and emotionally impassioned case for his book in his interviews.<br /><br />Reading the constructive reviews, it certainly seems like it is not the most definitive historical work on Jesus out there. Indeed, that would be a tall order. I look forward to it nevertheless (as well as to checking out some of the other works on Jesus recommended here).<br /><br />A person's religious background should not exclude them for writing about other religions in a historical context. To smear Aslan as pushing an agenda is deeply saddening, unjust, and dismissive of the real and loving work he seems to have put in. It's also incredibly hateful, unreasonable, and bigoted. Maybe this book will prove a disappointment, but if so, Aslan's religion has nothing to do with it.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Good suspense. Fast ending.<br />At the end Reacher disappears quickly--so American.<br />Lee Child at the top of his game, for sure.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|super fun! so many different dragons and after you reach a certain level you can start earning gems!!!! i love how i can get any thing without having to pay a dime!!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that it syncs with all my devices. I can start a book on my phone and finish on my tablet. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A fun game where kids can have a fun time keeps them from bugging the parents. I am Julianne and I approve this message.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice is a sad but compelling book, a personal tragedy and family drama about a professor who get early Alzheimer's disease. The professor, ironically a linguist, tries to remember what class she is teaching, debates whether to reveal her condition to her family and colleagues, and struggles with herself to plan for her decline.<br /><br />Her family scrambles to cope and finds news roles, and her children ponder their own genetic inheritance. The description of the disease is touchingly real, even down to a (perhaps too predictable) scene where she asks the same penetrating question twice at a student presentation. Still Alice is a rare story that will both hold your interest and make you think about yourself. And while it is sad, the book is at the same time strangely exhilarating: how, the reader must wonder think, would I fare in such a situation?
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Then I realized I needed to be playing it on Facebook, which I don't do so it was pointless and I deleted it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|If you like to laugh this is the show for you.  Hilarious and outrageous at the same time, you can not go wrong watching this show!
B009WUBERW|4.0|I was diss appointed in the first one cause Bruce and Arnold had small parts<br />This one had some great one liners like I expected<br />Predictable story, but who cares with all the great actors?
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This is probably the 8th time that I have seen this and every  time it just gets better. Period pieces are interesting to me..<br />Love the scenery.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Because it didn't seem to serve any purpose but I feel like I was having to recharge more often.  So I took it off my Kindle.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Finally a film that truly captures the strengths and flaws of the Man of Steel. This isn't your campy Supes of the 70s. This is him modernized for our generation and made realistically. The film itself is simply amazing. It will have you entertained and on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. This is a true origin reboot, so yes there's tons of destruction as Kal-El has his first rodeo with a villain of his strength. Because of this however, you will either truly love this film or completely hate it as a lot of critics did. I, myself, loved it as the majority of people that have seen it (80% average user reviews across the board; Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Metacritic...). Can't wait for the sequels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful directing, writing, set and costume design; makes you feel like you are part of the family.  Worth watching from the start.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|After reading some really poor reviews of SC, I really didnt expect much. It is definately better than I was led to believe. That being said, it is not one of Megadeth's better albums.  There are a few songs I really enjoy. One is the title track. They really took alot of crap over this one, being that it is not very heavy. I am ok with that. A little change is good sometimes. Kingmaker is a heavier one that is probably the best on the disc. I also really like the Thin Lizzy cover, Cold Sweat. If you are a longtime fan it is worth buying. If you are a new fan looking to get into Megadeth, there are better albums to start with like Peace Sells or Rust In Peace.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got the very new update a month ago it has lots more<br />material, u should get it right away!!!!!
1936891026|5.0|This book has been so helpful to me as a songwriter. It just reminds you that you just need to sit down EVERYDAY and DO WORK, and art will come. If you find yourself unmotivated or not inspired, you need this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 4 year old and I love this game. No bugs,  cute and very entertaining. Definitely a great way to kill some time.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|since i've seen the play 8 times it was great to see the movie. although i thought the cast  was somewhat weak
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Wonderful directing, writing, set and costume design; makes you feel that you are truly living in the time of Henry VIII.  But most definitely rated R.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed this series very much. Can't wait for next season. Would enjoy more period pieces like this in the future.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Have not read it yet that I recall, however does Follet ever write a bad book, I think not, I am sure I will love it thus the five stars
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This thing is so cool, mine even came with three inflatable toys and three rings that you can toss on the toys. Seriously, this would have been worth the money even if it only lasted the day. I have spent more money at the water park buying lunch! You cannot go wrong for $35. My two year old just loves this thing. She carries the sea creatures around and sends them down the slide, plays in the water streams, and goes down the slide herself. I was worried it would be a disappointment because of some of the reviews, but for now it has stayed inflated and water tight for almost a week. It is also great for lounging in on a hot night with a beer after your little ones go to sleep!
B0011MZOEI|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater when it was released and wanted to see it again. It deals with how crippled our society would be without computers since most of our utilities, communications and emergency services plus transportation relies on this technology. It is a very good film filled with action.
0399255370|5.0|SUCH A FANTASTIC BOOK!!!  GREAT FOR LITTLE KIDS AND EVEN MY 25 YEAR OLD LOVED IT.<br />A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Like all Nicholas Sparks books, Safe Haven did not disappoint. I really enjoyed as I had not seen the movie and this book had a little surprise twist - for me anyway.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Look, most science fiction movies stink. Especially these days.  If you're a fan, you know that. Because you've watched enough duds to earn your stripes.<br /><br />And when it comes to sci fi, you can't rate movies as compared to other genres.  So I give Oblivion 4 stars - Within the universe of Sci Fi films. Not 4 stars as compared to say, Dead Man by Jarmusch or Chinatown or Bergman films..  4 stars means that if your a fan of the genre and you are dying to watch something that doesn't make you groan, watch this.<br /><br /> Much like the recent \\"Dredd\\" or \\"Pandorum\\" from '09, this one is quite enjoyable. Good effects, decent story and not complete drivel. Hollywood serves up a ton of high budget crap. This one is well above average. Despite the fact that it has Tom Cruise and Morgan freeman.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We usually don't care for British shows, especially those set that far back in history. We had heard many positive comments from friends, and were aware of the accolades and professional awards won. Finally, we saw it free on Amazon Prime, and thought why not give it a try. It took about 3 episodes the get the characters and history straight...but from then on we were hooked. We would sometimes watch more than one episode per night. The end to Season 3 was so surprising and emotional that we cannot wait for season 4!
B0050SYS5A|4.0|It works great for my daughters room. She has<br />A small room so it helps out a lot when plays games on xbox
B00CF34B2I|4.0|the free version only goes as far as the first area in the campaign and want you to put down 10 buck to keep playing the rest of the game that allows you to unlock all the cards. so unless you really enjoy the actual game and don't mind wasting 10 on digital copies of card.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started reading these back in 2002 and was amazed to see such intense character development, and an author that wasn't afraid to test the limits. To this day I still regard the Song of Ice and Fire as one of the best series to ever be written.
1476734941|5.0|The basic premise is simple but very effective way to eat in a more healthy manner. By fasting two days/week and eating mostly salads and protein, it helps me to regulate my diet the rest of the week and form more healthy eating habits. Rationale is good, menus are very helpful. Would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their eating habits and maintain a proper weight.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Good action sequences but too many heros in one place. Can't keep up with the individual movies (Iron Man, Hulk, etc.)
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Excellent inside description of the financial crises. Highly recommended if you've got the patience to drudge thru CDO, tranche, explanations other financial product explanations.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is proof positive that these guys deserve to continue as Queensryche, not Geoff Tate and his collection of hired guns. Queensryche music has always been about a feeling. This cd reaches out at you in a way no other has since empire and promised land. Geoff Tates cd makes you feel something....utter disgust. Great  job boys
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just think this is one of the best shows on TV right now.  I watch alot of TV so I should know.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game. Beware. It's very addicting. I play the game when I should be doing something else.do not take your device with you to the restroom!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I recently joined a book and was at first was reluctant to start reading the story.  But the first page just reeled me in.  I wanted to find out what happened to each character as the story unfolded.  Mr. Hosseini is a masterful story teller. I want to read his other books now.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was skeptical about this movie, as I don't like psychological movies that try to get inside your head.  That was my pre-conception of this movie.  Turns out the movie was a great story about an innocent girl in a terrible society growing up and making some tremendous decisions that change history.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator looks great on the kindle Looks like a real calculator. Easy to use and not complicated. Simplicity at its best.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Simple, quick download.  Best way to manage Kindle materials on your tablets, or other mobile devices. Try it, you'll like it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic, story line keeps you guessing, laugh and cry.  Giving your life for your sister, nothing more precious
B0081336FO|5.0|What a great show - twists on the original stories, keeps you on your toes, the character development - just engaging and addictive overall.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Trip down memory lane to hear Janis again after all this time and really love her gutsy way of singing
1451648537|3.0|Glimpses of the real guy.  Did not finish it because I lost interest and it covers the same ground more than once.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THAT YOU CAN PLAY AS YOUR  FAVORITE MINIONS LIKE THE  BABY IT IS LIKE YOU HAVE A MINION YOUR OWN.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Marvel, enough said. This is actually SO good I had to add this last sentence because all you need to say to describe this movie is too short.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very entertaining, Robert Downey Jr. is comical and Thor is hot.  I actually went back and watched Iron Man, Captain America and Thor
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a fun and awesome adventurous game that will have you addicted in the first five seconds. It truly is epic!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Must watch if you are a Downton Abbey fan. Can't wait for next season to find out what happens next.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I loved this show when it first came out in the '60's and still do. The remastered version is so much better than the original film quality that it is almost like watching the episodes for the first time again!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Cute movie! A modern take on an old western. It made me want to go watch The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Animation was wonderful. Loved the music.
B00AEBB8FQ|1.0|Just Horrible!! I had to watch another movie right after this one finished to scrub it from my memory. It made it's way to the trash can so no one else will have to endure.
1781162646|5.0|Expect Nothing - Enjoy the Ride<br /><br />That's the rules when it comes to reading a Stephen King novel.<br /><br />When I pre-ordered Joyland, I never read the synopsis I fell in love with the book cover. Plus, it's a Stephen King novel. Judging from the cover, I was prepared to read a story about a crazy carnival serial killer, but when I began reading I knew I was preparing to start another journey.<br /><br />Joyland tells the story of Devin Jones, a heartbroken college student that takes a summer job at an amusement park named Joyland.  Joyland is a low-budget version of Disneyland, but to the residents of North Carolina, it's a place of fun rides, delicious food, and oh yeah... an unsolved murder that took place years ago on one of the popular rides, House of Horrors.<br /><br />The story of Joyland was told in retrospect by the main character, Devin Jones - there were times throughout the book that I worried about Devin... then I thought... \\"Oh! That's right Devin is still alive... he's the one telling the story.\\"<br /><br />Mr. King did an excellent job of developing characters that will stay in your heart long after closing the book. I also loved the fact the story was told in retrospect, which gave the readers a look in the future lives of the characters. Even though it made the story bittersweet because you find out some of the characters didn't live happily ever after.<br /><br />Stephen King is a versatile writer.  There's no question why Stephen King is loved by millions. His style of writing can grab the attention of the reader's heart, mind, and soul.<br /><br />Joyland.... What a Beautiful Ride...
B0002DB52M|2.0|This sounded interesting to me when I ordered it, but I was very disappointed in the movie.<br />However, the packaging, etc. was excellent.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|I got this for a system I built in a shuttle brand SFF computer (also from amazon)<br /><br />it has a good speed and features for a 64 bit system, without being pricy!<br /><br />perfect for use in a good workhourse day to day system, plus it can handle the graphics and other programswe run.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I loved this movie as a young child and after seeing it available in the list i thought my children would enjoy it!!! They did!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|In a very entertaining way Ken Follet takes you to the horror and politics of the second world war. So many thing I never new about Russia's role, the German people, what happened in Pearl Harbour etc etc.<br />I truly recommend this book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Sooooooo unbelievable. Watched both season 1 and 2 in less than a week. It is absolutely addicting. Makes me reconsider my career choice.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good practice for eye hand coordination. I love racing the clock. Makes you plan ahead but watch out some of the boards can be tricky.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Introduced this movie to our thirteen year old. He enjoyed just as much and became aware of the historical significance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. My little brother has minion run but he won't let me play so I got this game instead. I like it more because it goes on tour and right now it's in Paris. You can also buy different characters and some have different outfits you can get.it is a really fun game.
6305308659|4.0|Always on the lookout for audio visual aids to assist in the programmes I facilitate. This is excellent for use in Workshops on Embracing Change if you have the skills.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Loved the game and the challenge - but once it's over - it's over.<br />You can reset the game, but the hunt is the same - it doesn't mix up any clues or steer you in a new direction.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|I heard of this album through a friend, so I decided to try it.  Have really enjoyed it- there isn't a bad track on the whole album, and some tracks are outstanding.  Just turn up the volume and rock out!
B003L16FAE|5.0|This movie looks great in HD! I got it for $7.99, which for one of the best action movies of all time is a great deal. The bonus features are great, and they did an amazing job remastering the movie. Highly recommended!
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|If you want a different perspective on the life of Jesus that is thought provoking, this is one.  But it must be acknowledged that this author's perspective is very very insular, which is based in his religion of Islam...as such, much of this perspective is predictably self-serving. If you are one looking for a reason to discount Christianity, and the tenets of its belief, well, this book is for you.  If something like this had been written about Islam, from a christian author, you have to believe the knives and threats (and riots) would be rampant.  Take it for what it is and enjoy it (or not).
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have always enjoyed this show from the beginning of the series and just got caught up in time for season 3. Never fails to please!
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I am a history buff and Lincoln gave life to the history that I know of Abraham Lincoln.  This would be an excellent movie for teacher's to show to their students.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pinterest... I can spend hours on there!!<br />Pinterest has links to everything you love  - hobbies/vacations/house remodeling/crafts/clothes/recipes/tattoos/hair/nails/jewelry.. and more and more and more.<br />The app makes it convenient on the go!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I loved the writing and the acting!!  The drama went beyond &#34;formula&#34;, and was truly original, the suspense well done!
B008MMFBQQ|5.0|The only album I missed in this collection was &#34;Changing Horses&#34;.  You don't hear music like this anymore; poetry of spiritual idealism and Western music using quarter tones.  Really wonderful to hear so much stripped down performances and blatant idea<br />Is,
0345803485|5.0|I gave the book itself a 5 star rating as I usually son't read this type of book (Romance) however this isn'y just about romance. This book includes some drama as well as moments of suspense that keeps you wanting to read more and I can't wait to buy the sequals. As far as the product itself, this book wasn't in the best of condition, from page 12-20 was loose and fell out of the book, Thank God I had already read those pages as my puppy decided to chew them into shreds as I didn't notice right away that they had fallen out...
B005544TRQ|5.0|The back and forth banter, the suspenseful legal drama, and the movie quoting to further illustrate a situation make each and every episode a joy to watch.  I was late to the party with this show, but someone recommended it and I couldn't be happier because it is now one of my favorite shows to watch.  Season 2 is already shaping up to be a great one as well....
B009AMAJPA|5.0|I was so blown away by this movie when I saw it in the theaters, that I saw it twice in the same day. I went from one theater to another immediately. (My daughter was getting ready to see it at another theater, and I wanted to share the experience with her). Colin Farrell did a superb job in his role as Victor. The other actors did an excellent job too. The movie scored in all areas; action, romance, emotion, twists, entertainment, etc. I cannot wait to see it again on DVD. I just can't say enough. Incredible movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|No problems with this app.  It works perfectly on the Kindle Fire HD and I would recommend it to anyone
B004ZNB12O|5.0|If you are a Pink Floyd fan, this is the one to get.  All the best songs.  Get the CD version, not MP3.  Sound quality is much better and you will always own the album.
B005RZ8WIA|5.0|Of course I am pleased! Its my most favorite album ever!! Nothing compares to Volbeat or amazon.com! I purchased in online and within 2 days it was at my front door =)
006016848X|3.0|I haven't read this book yet, but my husband has read it in the past and says it's a great book to read that it helped him to understand women much better and that I have to agree with sometimes I think he knows more about women than I do. HAHA The book itself was rather old as the pages were yellowed and stiff..
159463176X|5.0|The book is very well written, with the multiple interrelated stories told with emotion and humanity. If you like the other books by Khaled Hosseini, you will like or love this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always wanted my own horse and now I have 1. It is like a dream come true. I can't wait to buy another
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As usual Jeffrey Archer tells a great tale.  Once again he has left us hanging and we will have to wait until the next book in the series to find out what happened.  All in all a great read
B007IXWKUK|4.0|--what I expected.  From the hype and the rip-offs, I thought this would be centered around BDSM not a love and reasonably vanilla story.  I wish them luck.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the mental challenges of this game. It kept me occupied for hours.  Very interesting and surprisingly entertaining.'........ ........... ........
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever since the best song ever been a great job on this one that has the right thing for a few weeks of this year ago I had the same way that is a good time and energy is not responsible to a good thing about it has a few days after a great way for you and and to be able to get the best song ever seen a great deal to get to the same way
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Quiet, easy to watch, with well developed characters. You will be pulled into the stories of the everyday lives of the people of Candleford and Lark Rise.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Web content streaming is the reason I'm purchasing this ! Hope it works well with streaming movies which my Roku can't do
B002RI9HUM|3.0|This is the first time I have read any books by this author.  This book would not be a favourite of mine but I found that I couldn't seem to leave it down because I wanted to see how it ended.  I really didn't enjoy it much but would definitely try  other books by the same author
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Enjoyed this thoroughly.  I can't wait to read the next one.  So many unanswered questions.  Ready to go back to Westeros.  Who wins the game of thrones?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best book ever!!! I love the people and the plot!!! It keeps you on your toes about how it will turn out and what happens a next! My favorite books ever!!!!!!!!! :)
B009K0P10K|5.0|Didn't know how they were going to top the first series but they did and so much more! It is a must see for certain!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|We watched as a family and then I have to confess, I watched it again by myself.  Loved it as much as the orignal from years ago...maybe more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a very cool game. Very much like SimCity, though obviously with less control and detail. While money generation eventually comes to be rapid, the other items you need come slowly (unless you buy them with real money, of course). There are multiple goals to achieve, and that's a definite good. But the help section is slim...there are multiple things I would like to do, but no direction or clue as to how to do them. At least not in the help section.<br /><br />The graphics are pretty good for a tablet game, and the music is decent, though it does get repetitious after a bit.<br /><br />All in all a decent game, especially if you like the city-building genre.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I've been waiting for the Honor series to hit Kindle as my library did not carry them. It was worth the wait. I am a fan and enjoy the Safehold & Ring of Fire series. Good writing, storyline etc. I highly recommend it :-)
B000K4WPCC|5.0|Really good action packed movie full of good looking stars. highly recommend watching this movie shipping was fast and I've watched it over and over again
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|A unique, romanticized twist on the zombie genre that has become so popular these days.  Just enough gore and comedy to keep it well balanced. A little slow in spots, but what movie lately hasn't been?  All in all, totally worth watching for the nerdy, zombie-loving universe.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|One of the best suspensful series in some time! Can't wait until season 2! If you like Kevin Bacon you will love the following every episode is a cliffhanger!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Great cast and great story line.  Kept me hanging on every episode wanting more.  I would encourage anyone wanting to watch a good TV series to watch all of the Lost episodes including this season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because I don't really read fiction.  Once I started, I couldn't put it down!  It's so easy to read and it constantly tugged at my emotions!  I never thought I'd say this but I'm looking forward to reading book two!
B0050VA428|5.0|I read this book as a child, probably middle school age.  I remember how captivated I was at the time. So recommended the book for my middle school son.  I started reading it out loud to my whole family and found it just as enjoyable as it was years ago.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|A lot of people have been speaking poorly about this album because most of the songs don't have the groove of say a pantera or superjoint ritual song. This album, according to Phil Anselmo, was meant to be a very extreme metal album with songs that are very aggressive and structurally all over the place. I for one am glad Phil Anselmo didn't just release a bunch of pantera wannabe songs, instead he made an album that is full of aggressive songs that are all over the place. Keep rockin Phil, and if you are expecting to hear songs that resemble pantera or superjoint ritual, this album isn't for you.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this cover! When I'm watching a movie or show, I like &#34;widescreen&#34; view, but when it comes to books I'm old fashioned. I want it to look like a real page I can sink my nose into LOL It holds the Kindle Fire HD 7 that I have in perfect place either way. When this one wears out, I know where I'll go for a replacement!
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|handwriting is becoming a thing of the past and I really love that this app lets u handwrite notes on today's technology I like the was it was developed good job Ben Lee!
B005GRTNXC|2.0|Not here best cd.  I didn't like that she didn't have her power ballets like her other one. I love her and was dissappointed with this cd.  Listened to it twice.....not good.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I loved the show when it was on TV and can love it again on Amazon. I am currently on Series 2 now and loving it too!!
B006UG909U|5.0|How awesome it is to hear DLR sing with Van Halen again!  This CD makes me sooo freakin' happy!  I just can't get enough of it.  Looking forward to their next release.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This album is the dawn of a new era of Queensryche. Yes it is a shame that Geoff Tate and the band had to end the way they did, but even though the band lost their longtime front man, this album does not disappoint. Todd La Torre suits the band very well and he has the voice that goes along great with the music. Now that the band and Tate have parted ways, the band sounds like they have a lot more energy and creativity in their songs and that is what makes this album so addicting. The new era of Queensryche certainly looks promising.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I have loved the series since the very first show! I just love the cast, except the losing of Paget Brewster & her replacement. Her replacement to me, was/still is completely horrible. I will keep watching & just put up with the screeching in my head when the replacement is talking or on screen! But the rest of the team have become family! If Derek, Rossi, Hotch, Reed, or JJ leave, the great show will be lost. If someone asks me about the show, they get a great rundown of the show & an invite to spend a couple hours watching the show through my collection.  This show is a great way to spend an evening leaving your problems behind!
B000WN7NEQ|5.0|I really liked the dance scenes.  I think Venessa and Chayanne are great entertainers.  I liked the mosic also.  What else can I say, it is a great movie.
B000M0QMM8|5.0|Perfect movie for children or the 90s kid in your life.  The humor is innocent and the movie is just a fantastic reminder of why MJ is the best.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|For me, photography in movies is everything. Setting the entire theme and emotion. This picture followed through with that to a T.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is just as good as book 1. It makes you want to keep turning the pages. I will definitely be reading book 3. I recommend the whole series and cannot wait to see what is next for this author.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app a lot before leaving the house. I also like to know the temperature at home to protect my dogs from the heat. I use it everyday just to know what kind of day and week to expect. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I've had chargers die on quickly but I've had no issues with this charger!  The double charge option is definitely an added bonus.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. You often see musicians and think what a great life you have. You don't really know what it took for them to get to where they are at now.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Not a big Affleck fan when he's acting. He did a passable job, but the direction and supporting actors were superb!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Much better than anticipated. Slow in the beginning but quick in the end. Hopefully the next two are released closer together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's good I guess could be better but I like the competing part the best . Brianna is out of here<br /><br />B
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Just what I expected and I love listening to it all the time. Can't get songs out of my head!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Let's just say I was glad to be done with this book.  Too many artillery specs for my taste.  It was written in a strange manner, jumping all around from one country to another and one character to another.  I liked the part about how the dog were trained the most
B008JFUO4U|1.0|I LOVE SCI FI MOVIES BUT THIS WAS SO SLOW,BORING AND POINLESS. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. HOW ANYONE CAN GIVE THIS A GOOD REVIEW IS BEYOND ME.DOES ANYONE IN HOLLYWEIRD EVER BOTHER WATCHING THEIR OWN MOVIE BEFORE THEY PUT IT OUT SO THEY CAN SEE THAT IT SUCKS???
B001NHNG64|3.0|Plenty of action. Some of the detailed description gets a bit tedious. Thought he may get the girl this time. Reacher the loner rides again.
0385349947|5.0|I have bought about a dozen copies and have been giving it to all of my friends.  It is wonderfully written and incredibly researched.  I agree that the book speaks primarily to white upper class women but for this group it does an amazing job of laying where women are and how far we still have to go.
B004WR125O|5.0|This is an important addition to my Onkyo receiver. It never fail since I installed it almost a year ago.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|Picks up every other sound and you can't speak while wearing the device. When volume is turned up, the sound quality is terrible.
1451673442|5.0|This is a book everyone who is looking for motivation and inspiration in their life should read. It's a life changer!
B0039A8QVI|5.0|Easton Corbin brings you back to the days when George Straight was young. Simple songs with feel good lyrics, and occasionally a powerful ballad.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Wasn't a bad movie..in fact it was probably a well acted movie/ Just wasn't what we were expecting. A little too &#34;art&#34; movie for our tastes
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's an awesome game...I play it all the time on my phone and now I got it on my Kindle fire HD.... love love love!!! :)
B0042TV4IW|4.0|A very low key show that is great to pass the time. It is something nice to watch, but nothing extraordinary.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is a beautiful, inspiring book that changed my entire perspective on life. If you are looking to be absolutely awe-struck and inspired in hopes to turn your life around and increase the quality of your life, I would recommend this book.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time greatest game ever don't get rid of it keep it. ( :
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I think this is a great product for a great price.<br /><br />After setting up the device it's so easy for anyone around to connect and stream content. I love that.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because of the price and it's capabilities. If you want something that can allow you to watch Google Play movies or YouTube video's then this is the easiest way to do that. That's what I was looking for.<br /><br />Here is what I would like to see in the future:<br />-Amazon Video Compatibility from iPhone or Android (hopefully Amazon creates this)<br />-Better Chrome video support without the choppiness<br />-More Apps<br /><br />Also, it's worth mentioning that my Sony Bravia is HDMI-CEC compatible. What that means is that I was able to test this device's ability to turn on the TV and switch to the proper input. It worked perfectly. However it would be nice to be able to turn off the TV from my iPhone as well. There was no way to do this (that I could find). I would imagine there will be a Chromecast App available soon for the iPhone that will allow this.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|cant stop playing this game cause you wont the high score but havnt got there yet but will keep on trying
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Having read much about WWII, I was totally surprised at what I learned about what went on in the US before Pearl Harbor.  Fabulous book.  Author did wonderful research and her writing is wonderful.  She had me at her previous book, Citizens of London.  This one is just as great.
0062060562|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed reading the book. It had so many plot twists and surprises that it constantly drew me in, kept my attention, and left me breathlessly wanting more. It's very exciting for me when something happens and you don't expect it. This book will definitely be hard for any book lover, especially this particular genre, to put down. Highly recommended.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|As one gets deeper and deeper into the story, one cares less and less about the newly added characters.<br />We always want more about our favorites.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|love it - i just can't put it down.  great to compare with what i have watched with the tv show
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun I really like the fluffy unicorn that you can unlock a little like temple run
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|i was pleased with this movie.  it was good.  i enjoyed it.  i would watch it again.  the acting was good.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Nice entertaining movie. We enjoyed till the end. Great movie to watch with the kids older than 8.  . .
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Possibly one of the best parts about this album (and most of his material) is Tyler's self production. His beats stand out for the best than most in the &#34;rap game&#34; these days. The melodic chords take you on a trance. The deluxe edition is a great buy!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing it has suspense romance adventure and of course surprises I love this book and have read it multiple times and my favorite of the three books I am not going to spoil it but if you're looking for a new favorite book this is it!!!!!!
0345803485|3.0|I think what a lot of other people writing reviews on here fail to understand or have pleasure in erotic writing and fan fiction. We are coming into an age where things such as fandoms exist- its creating fans that write excessively about their fandom in their FANTASIES. So comparing this on the scale of great literature like Jane Austen or Hewingway- you just sound like an idiot. This trilogy was written in the format of a fan fiction, a fantasy of the author's with a mixture of BDSM to spice things up a bit. James creates a handsome devilish guy that swipes the character away, but the reason I like this book over twilight is that it holds more depth and strength in the main female character. The main female character doesn't just roll over because she's in love with him but she discovers this sexual desire for the first time, she chooses to have sex with him, she chooses to explore this desire she's never felt before. The separation between sex and love is a powerful one, people forget that sex ISN'T just about having babies, it can be fun and exciting and expressive. A lot of women hate this book because of that, and I'm telling you that's because the idea of a book being erotic can seem very 2D to people that think in very traditional terms. This book isn't going to be one of the great literary works of it's time but the idea of writing erotic romance novels is groundbreaking. This book sold more then the Harry Potter series, so obviously we all have a dark fantasy of our own.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Very clever. Keeps you wanting to see more. Good acting. Good plot. Storylines with a heavy criminal element would be nice.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game and the creators make another one very soon!!!!<br />I think I'm going to go crazy unless they put out another Room soon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and addicting!!!  And it's just like temple run but better!!! And you should watch the movies they r amazing
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This puzzle is pretty and the music is nice but<br />I don't get the benefit of this puzzle. It's just ok.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is so much better than the handmade I love it so much God has blessed the people with a gift of talent that brings happiness and cheer to the world
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series. Just started watching  Seasons 1 and 2 last week. Can't stop watching. I'm not usually one that would watch a zombie show, but this has so much more to it than that. Love it, love it, love it. Can't wait for season 4!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is fun to play on my kindle fire. Graphics are the best I have found! This is a must own.
140131046X|4.0|The book was well written and the feelings of the author seem to come through.  I would have enjoyed reading a little about the Jewish faith.  Perhaps he felt his approach seemed to balance out the two main characters and their accomplishments.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Those who don't like science fiction will love these books. Those who love science fiction will love these books. I believe  most people who are those who love interesting,exciting and unbelievably spellbinding stories will not be able to put this down..
B00CW665VI|5.0|Narrator Drew tells a great tale as he sweeps us along in this engaging, well-written, excellently-paced story. This book was especially enjoyable bc while the storyline itself doesn't break new ground, the male POV puts an entirely new twist on boy meets girl, boys pisses girl off, etc. Besides, Drew is fun to listen to and it was a treat following his journey from man-whore to whipped (bumps, colossal screw ups, fantastic gestures and all).
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Tremendous movie that can not fail to have in your collection. Comes in a very good book kind of really
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this book! Couldn't put it down, E L James need  to write more! She is fantastic at capturing your attention!
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This was a great book and I think they dd a pretty good job with the movie. I liked the way they portrayed the aliens in their true form.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|My fiance and I have gone to see this movie twice in 3D since it released.  The movie blew us away.  I absolutely recommend seeing it on the big screen and picking up the blu-ray.  For me, it compares to the experience of seeing Avatar or Avengers in 3D at the theatre.  Definitely blows Transformers and Cloverfield away as far as scale, action, and special effects goes.  I even picked up the soundtrack and have been working out to it for the last week and a half.  Anything that I can do to support this nerdgasm of a movie, I will do.  It is sad when a movie like Grown Ups 2 blows away Pacific Rim at the box office.  Come on America!  Support this movie!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I have been a fan of Adichie's since I ready &#34;Under Half a Yellow Sun&#34; 3 years ago.  A year ago I attended an event in which she was reading from &#34;Americanah&#34; prior to its publication.  I bought it as soon as I knew it was published.  Having lived in Nigeria at one time, and having many contacts in both the African Diasporic and African-American communities, she  captures the essence of both experiences.  Her satirization of the role of diversity training sessions in mainstream American institutions is brilliant.  Her ability to move nimbly between cultures and capture the essence of each is extraordinary.  In addition, her writing keeps one engaged -- I couldn't put it down!
1616550414|5.0|the book is the best bit of game history i have found now just read over and and over for fun!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. I was hooked from the moment I started reading! I'm ready to read what happens next!!!!
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Jaws is an all time great. Of course you have to kep in mind how long ago it was made.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was amazed at how closely the show followed the book!  That didn't make the read dull or boring, though, because it gave me more insight into how the characters were feeling.  You really get a much better feel for HOW YOUNG some of the main characters are, and the heavy, life-altering decisions they must make without the life-experience to back up those decisions. A great book - and I am looking forward to reading the rest in the series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderfully, written, acted, and directed series. The setting is a wonderful backdrop of social changes and thinking and how it affects this one upper class family. Watch it!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so good, I lost my mother my sophomore year and I felt a lot like Charlie in this book and I can just relate so much to Charlie in this book. I think High schools should assign this to students to read because it's interesting and you learn a lot from this story.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|Didn't believe most of it.  Not because her mother was an angel, but because I couldn't understand her not asking questions, or confronting either her mother or father.  For that matter , she never confided in her uncle.<br />She never mentions any other family members or close friends of her mom.<br />Most of what she writes is just not believable.
0385341008|5.0|My fabulous friend recommended that I read this book.  Once I opened the first page, I couldn't put it down.  I totally got caught up in the book, the characters, the time in history...I wanted to crawl in the book and become part of the story!!  The story is written in a series of letters and each letter drawls you into the story more and more.  If you like history, love stories, stories about survival, stories about people pulling together to survive...then this book is definitely for you.  You HAVE to read this book!  Now... I want to visit Guernsey Island myself and walk among the people and the land.  READ it...this book would be a fabulous  book for a Book Club.
B000SNW0HA|4.0|My favorite albums from Daft Punk are probably their second and third. This one sounds like a first album to me, but I don't regret picking it up at all. To me it sounds like they were trying to push things just because they were signed. Or maybe like they were trying to be less pop to make a point. Not quite sure, but I still liked it. Their albums are all a little different and I appreciate that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome it is the best one on my kindle I gave it a 5 star review and I don't give any thing a 5  star review I would even get it if it was $5.99
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|It was great. I think I'll watch it again. It's interesting that Maya made it all happen, naturally she had to fight bureaucrats.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|it is free and worth playing. play on my note 2 flawlessly.and the multiple play is better, so far the best game on my phone
0143122061|4.0|Niall Ferguson is one of the best popular historians today, certainly one of the most ubiquitous.  And for good reason.  His writing is crisp, well researched, and illuminating and appeals to both the hardcore history buff as well as to the uninitiated.  However as good as he is, he has a strong tendency to wander off topic.  This book is a showcase of the best and worst tendencies of Mr. Ferguson's work.  Starting roughly in the 1500s, Mr. Ferguson charts the rise of Western Civilization through six different innovations, or \\"killer apps,\\" that were unique to the West's success.  Like his other works,  [[ASIN:0465023290 Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power]] and [[ASIN:0143034790 Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire]], Ferguson tries to combine two different narrative structures: a topical structure, where each chapter corresponds to one of those six apps, and a chronological structure, where the narrative moves sequentially through history.  In the first three chapters (Competition, Science, and Property) this works beautifully as the development of these three apps corresponds to the period in history.  This is when Mr. Ferguson is at his best.  But things break down dramatically starting in the second half of the book.  In chapter 4, which deals with medicine, he abandons the overarching theme of what caused the West's rise to showcase some of the West's atrocities (eugenics and experiments on Africans during the 19th century colonial era).  He's already charted the moral and economic decline of the West in [[ASIN:0143112392 The War of the World: Twentieth-Century Conflict and the Descent of the West]] as well as some of his other works, so chapter 4 was rather repetitive for anyone who has read his other works.  Chapter 5 on Consumption starts to get back on track, but not wholly back on course.  Chapter 6 is where he gets back fully on course, which is absolutely fascinating, but he does seem totake a lot from Max Weber's work on the \\"Protestant Work Ethic.\\"  And his conclusion on the rise of China and the relative decline of the West is worthy of consideration.  In summation, Mr. Ferguson has written another fascinating and pertinent work, but Mr. Ferguson's bad habits hold this one back.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It's kind of boring and not really funny. Wasn't the worst thing I have seen, but I would not watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|very displeased.  it has interest for me. what a waste of time. would not recommend it to a friend or anyone.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|the game was very creative and challenging. I would love to see a part two to Enigmatis the ghosts of maple creek
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun strategy game that keeps you entertained through all the levels. It is a think-outside-the-box sort of app. I love it!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is as much a social commentary as it is a look at mental illness. Well written, brilliantly acted, and full of meaning and subtext. This is a far deeper story than many will detect. Watch it with one eye trained on mental illness and it is very different. Guys tend to like this movie because it is filled with a bunch of guys beating each other up, but that is not what the story is about at all. From the perspective of one with a psychology degree, this is a very sad story of a man with tremendous inner conflict and pain. There is much hatred, pain, self-loathing and self-harm between the lines. Fantastic movie. Do not let your kids watch it.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|There were so many stickers - my four year old had a blast putting them up.  They are reusable so if she wants to rearrange them she can.  Sjhe also loves the sparkle jems that stick on the walls too.  They do not damage the paint.  They really brighten up her room!!!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I like Bruce Willis and this movie lived up to his reputation.  It was funny with action. I would recommend this movie.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Loved the score, loved the lyrics, loved the story. Waiting impatiently to see it. Cyndi Lauper and Michael Firestein are genius. Delivery of this CD was speedy as usual.
140006922X|5.0|There are way too many prejudiced reviews from people claiming to be Christian but haven't even read the book. Their malicious reviews are hardly worth reading. They don't even represent the majority Christian opinion of the book, since I am a Christian, loved the book, and so have my other Christian friends that have read it.<br /><br />Zealot is thoroughly researched and engagingly written. It gives an in depth account of the true Jesus that walked in Palestine 2000 years ago, the Jesus that is quite different than the one I learned about in Sunday school. In Zealot you learn where Jesus lived and travelled, what people said about him, why he was crucified, and how his message spread in the early years after his death. You will find a much clearer picture of the message Jesus really preached and why he was willing to die for it.<br /><br />As good as the book itself is, the notes and bibliography at the end are just as good, with numerous references and credit given to all the sources he used throughout the book. The notes especially are well written and expand on many of the more complex issues in Zealot.<br /><br />I have been a Christian for 20 years now and this book is just what I needed to deepen and broaden my understanding of who Jesus really was. I picked it up on a Friday, and by Saturday night was done reading it!<br /><br />If you are a Chrstian, definitely consider reading this book.
B00DUIBZSK|1.0|I realize Gomez just turned 21 and the money people in the industry who manufactured her are targeting a specific audience, young teenage girls, but with that said this CD is truly an abomination for all who still view music as an art form. This is nonstop, computer generated trash. Gomez is basically a lifeless nonentity, playing the part. These are not her words, nor her voice, plastic in every sense. Compare this inane drivel to say the remarkable works of a young Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and you can plainly see the sad, soulless state of today's so-called music. I don't blame Gomez, she seems like a nice person simply taking advantage of a lucrative role offered her by the powers that be but it speaks volumes to the growing void and emptiness of a once prized medium for talented, creative young artists that had something to say and did so in a truly magical way. The world I am afraid grows more sterile by the day.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Very surprised by how good this movie actually was, wonderful cast made the most of good story, surprised to see that Dustin actually directed what seems a primarily British/European production. Highly recommend!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|We are almost through season 3, and I have to say that the writing has gotten better, and the characters more interesting and more real as the series progressed. Truly intelligent, without the phony &#34;snappy&#34; repartee that passes for intellect and wit on shows like &#34;The West Wing&#34;, it has given me some insight into the world of the law. I recognize it's a show, not a documentary, but it appears to this layman to examine the role of lawyers in various legal dilemmas and society. I find it pretty interesting and entertaining for that reason, plus the very real growth that Alicia has gone through in three seasons. And Alan Cumming as Eli Gold is a classically hilarious and well acted character. Well done, funny and insightful. A step below shows like &#34;The Wire&#34;, &#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34;, &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, &#34;Mad Men&#34; and &#34;The Sopranos&#34;, but well worth watching.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have used this app since December 2011 on my Kindle Fire.  It was very useful until the July 2013 update.  This app is now confusing and worthless. I have deleted it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I have had this mouse for a few weeks now and overall it has been a great mouse for the price.It has a lot of nice features like being able to customize the dpi from 200-8000. It has 9 programmable buttons that you can set to basically whatever you want. There are multiple LEDs in the mouse for the logo, mouse wheel, and dpi setting indicator. While you can customize the color of the logo, the rest of the LEDs are stuck blue. The only other problem I have is the mouse feels as if it was designed for a child's hand. overall I recommend the mouse.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|I love this iPhone protector because it allows me to put my driver's license, hospital insurance card, and credit card behind the phone so they're always with me and I don't need to carry a purse,
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Something just didn't work here. If this were a normal writer it wouldn't be so bad - but this is Michael Connelly.  It's not even close to his earlier books. The middle really drags. The ending is decent but it doesn't make for all the time spent wondering how much more I had to read before I was finished.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was such a unique idea, I couldn't put the book down. Riggs does a great job of reeling you in without giving anything away. Excited to read the second one!
B008MM9630|5.0|Awesome and addictive game. would recommend anyone to play it. Best part is that you do not needninternet to play it for the most part.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|Very clever plot, excellent animation. Loved the voice work. It's one we enjoy over and over. It's also good to watch it again before you go see &#34;Monsters University.&#34;
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Very good.  I didn't go to see the movie when it was in the theater because I could not think of any way you could improve on a classic fairy tale.  I was surprised when I purchased it.  The movie moved along well and kept me interested all the way through it. I recommend it to anyone just remember that this is not the fairy tale and it made a very good adult movie.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love this series!! its original and full of action. IDK who said this series was like Harry Potter but it isn't at all :)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The great tony stark is fantastic... hulk is too cool. Peper pots is awesome... and the ship is the other planet
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this very much. Very fun game.<br /><br />I can't wait for more rooms to be added. Over way too fast.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I thought this was an interesting book and really gave me something to think about. I will probably read the other books that follow.
1400067820|1.0|Too much BS!<br />I could sum it up as follows:  1) Select investment ventures that have low loss potential and high gain potential.<br />  2) Get inside or undiscovered information before risking anything.<br />  3) Learn only by your own mistakes.  History is distortedly irrelevant.<br />  4) Organized education is unnecessary and harmful to individual experimentation.<br /><br />The author is just  pseudo-intellectual showing off his ability to mix metaphors and drop names.  He' s like a Texan with a big hat and no cattle.  Rich, proud, and arrogant.  This emperor wears no clothes.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The more I read this series the happier I am .. this author knows her stuff :) shes got great character development and doesnt overwhelm her readers with boring details.. great balance :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good book I was surprised by the ending. I really enjoyed it can't wait tell I watch the movie :)
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Once you get half way, it's almost impossible to stop watching.<br /><br />The old dog was not in his house and there are oonly seven more words required.
B00AEFY4CG|5.0|A very touching and thoughtful film worth viewing more than once.  The comic nature provided by Whoopi offsetting the more sensitive issues prompts both laughs and tears.
1400052181|5.0|This book was purchased as part of a summer reading requirement for a Biology class.  It's a compelling read and one that brings a discussion of ethics in medicine to the attention of the American conscience.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Having just travelled to India this book was of special interest.  A very real and interesting depiction of life in a very foreign country.  The slums,the pollution, the way women are treated...a very interesting book.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Like so many other movies that depict what our military goes though, while deployed and when they return, this movie is even more intense considering what the EOD Unit performs.<br /><br />Brilliant acting and directing - well deserved of the Academy it won.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game but can you please add pets like cats and dogs and lever and those things that move blocks.lol.:) thanks!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Fun game with challenges.  Enjoy the graphics and cute characters. Would recommend for adults and children alike.  Working on second level.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Fabulous, couldn't put it down. Makes you believe in love all over again. There is a Victoria in all of us
B001FSDOZO|5.0|lost this cd recently. This is my favorite Nickelback Cd. I can listen to this cd over and over again.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|A great show i love the show it has action suspense and great plot twists u will love it from the 1st episode u watch
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I made lots more facebook friends playing this game. It does have a few bugs, but it is fun. I'm not so hot on the slots part, but the bingo part is fun. I really like it when I get all the awards!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This is definitely one series that I’m very sad to see end.  And, I’ll just go ahead and declare, that I’m definitely on Team Eric here.  I will withhold any spoilers for those of you who haven’t read it yet.  I’ll just say that no matter what, to me, Sookie belongs with Eric.<br /><br />That being said, I really enjoyed this book.  I happened upon some spoilers myself and I was reluctant to start the book even though I very much anticipated it.  At first, I had a hard time following what was going on, but as soon as I figured all that out, it was back to the normal vibe that this series usually carries.  There were some definite unexpected twists along the road, but in the end, I guess I’m not surprised at where it ended up.  While I can’t say much more without giving specifics away, I do recommend reading the series finale if you’ve enjoyed the others.  Regardless of who you think Sookie should be with.  These will forever be some of my favorite characters to read about!<br /><br />~Crystal~<br /><br />***This book was given free for an honest review***
B008G3N71W|1.0|It set back human dignity, male and female, by eons.  There was no real point.  I kept waiting for one, but...
B002ZG976U|5.0|I saw this movie on TV once, didn't think i would like the movie but I did. I don't buy DVD's unless its a really good movie and this one made my list.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|So after I read the first book I was really eager to start reading the second and let's say I wasn't disappointed at all. I love how I loved it ,hated it and just couldn't stop reading. The ending is a cliff hanger an I can't wait until I get to read the third. It's a great read and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a book with a real girl with real problems.
159463176X|5.0|[[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]]I love the way he (Khaled Hosseini) writes, it was an amazing adventure. Once again I was transported to a place that I don't know but that somehow it becomes familiar through his words. It gives me an understanding and a connection to a culture that is unknown to me personally.The story is so beautiful and tha way that each character is presented, connected and part of the same story it makes for great story telling. Fell in love with Nabi such a great human, so full of love and good intentions.  I also had read [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] and [[ASIN:1442364203 A Thousand Splendid Suns: A Novel]] thanks to a dear friend that told me about this amazing writer. I was so excited when I found out that he had this new novel that I couldn't wait to read it, he has this style of writing that it comforts me...looking foward to the next one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It is so fun. You have to care for your horse and you can enter in shows. Although it's nothing like owning your own horse it is a very fun app. I recommend this app for people of all ages who love horses.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is better than the movie! I can't wait to read the rest in the series. Baum had a great imagination.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Reminds me of West Wing,one of the best tv series ever. Always look forward to Tuesday nights.  Glad to see the excellent writing and acting is continuing.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Infants notoriously spit out pacifiers - it's a fact.<br />We love the Wubbanub because it positions the pacifier in such a way that my daughter can stop sucking for a moment and it does not fall out and roll away.<br />At 14 weeks old, she will now slurp on the legs, tail and head of this thing and is learning to put the pacifier back in on her own - Don't leave home without it!!! :)
1451648537|3.0|In my opinion the author goes in to too much detail on parts of Job's life I wasn't interested in reading. Takes hundreds of pages just to get to the start of Apple.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Ordered this to watch on a plane ride - decent, but not great - which is pretty much what I expected, so I wasn't disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is fun and challenging but not so hard that my kids are able to play and still have fun.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|What happens to this guy could happen to anyone nowadays. Gives you something to think about.  Read it and decide what  would YOU do?
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|What I liked most was how many characters were played by just a few actors/actresses. That was very impressive. Storyline can be challenging to follow,
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I first watched this movie on my Kindle while my husband lay next to me sick and finally asleep. I thought no harm I had seen all the forerunners. Oh was I wrong. Alone each hero was great and some hit way over the mark but together they were hilariously toxic. My only hole in the hero series had been the Hulk. My Bad. Dr Banner and his partner stole the show as far as I am concerned. How can he be so understated juxtapositioned to the Hulk. And Natasha, my heroine; I don't know about a Black Widow but when she gets moving all I see are bodies. No blood, no bad words, no overt; no I am not blind! Natsha rocks and those guys don't hurt the eyes at all most of all Samuel Jackson. Loki could use a change of head gear or maybe a string of lights, green I think.  ENJOY!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins if you are able to write a saga this good please don`t stop on three books keep them comming!
B00CRW2066|3.0|&#34;Alligator&#34; was really good, &#34;The Boxer&#34; was even better, &#34;High Violet&#34; was amazing, but &#34;Trouble Will Find Me&#34; is just okay.  It's got a handful of decent songs mixed in with what sound like B-sides.  I would have waited longer for better.  But I'm okay with a band that fails now and again.  I wouldn't call this a failure, exactly.  I listened to &#34;High Violet&#34; non stop, and still listen to it all the way through.  However, I've listend to &#34;Trouble Will Find Me&#34; only a handful of times, I can never make it through in one sitting, and I haven't listened to it since the week of it's release.  As always, judge for yourself.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|A true masterpiece in film, but more importantly, a hard story that must be told.  We must never forget the atrocities of the Holocaust, and we must make sure it never happens again, to anyone!.  Well done Mr. Spielberg.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|this movie is one of the best to come out of the 80s, arrived on time and in perfect condition. Love it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is really informative, and is really easy to navigate to get all kinds of data.  I've used it in many countries and found it to be incredibly accurate!  I don't use or need any other weather apps!  Highly recommend!
B008M721MS|2.0|....Its slow sometimes...it glitches up and also turns green but overall its good to connect with family and friends over summer and holoday breaks;)
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I would have thought they would have ran out of uniqueness for their sound but they keep finding a way to keep each album fresh.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love despicable me, and mainly for the minions! This game is like a better version of temple run, where you can go to different places from the movie, and, you can battle evil villains. The only problem i have with this is the graphics. They are cool at times, but they some times freeze and mess me up or confuse me a bit.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Dodging, weaving, swerving, while firing weapons and utilizing special attacks - this game is a lot of fun!!  Equally challenging to make upgrade decisions with limited resources.  This is a great free game that with holds no benefits for those who want to play and takee the slow route while providing economical prices for those who want to get ahead a little faster.  Needs stages within routes however so that one doesn't  keep running the same course after a main boss is beat.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have had a Logitech Gaming headset with mic for the past few years. It was time for a new one. I am extremely happy with this so far. Range is great, sound is above average and the comfortable fit is such a plus! Will stick with Logitech as long as they continue to make quality products!
B002JVWR4A|4.0|Overall a good season, was delightfully surprised by the very prompt delivery. The season was in excellent condition when arrived as well.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This is not what I was looking for.  I wanted the Candy Crush game.  I will look for another game. Thanks
B004EPZ07K|2.0|The Blu-ray come with both the theater and extended cut versions. First this is a terrific movie in all respects a very campy comic movie. The extended cut is superior to the theatrical release but about half the movie is flawed with audio sync off by 2-3 seconds. What a shame. I will try to get a replacement.
B002R88G5E|5.0|After reading &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; I wanted to read more of Hosseini's work which is situated in Afghanistan. &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; didn't disappoint, in fact, I found it to be totally engrossing.  His turn of phrase, the pace of the story and the human tragedy and triumph conveyed by his perfectly chosen words made it very difficult to put down the book when real world needs arose. The strength of characters, both dignified and wretched were very human and believable. The story allows  another small glimpse inside a culture so different to Western Culture.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|Very suspenseful! And pretty creepy. Love this show. I only wish that the second season was available for Prime members. Can't wait till it is.
B003EYVXXW|2.0|Very inaccurate depiction of early Christians. Nonfactual content as to teaching methodologies of that era. Another Hollywood divisive movie to create division in world religions and spawn hatred for Christians as well as defamation. A lawsuit against the makers would be appropriate. In a word: Subterfuge. Kohl Nidre is alive and well. Most Sincerely, Flora Rhodes, MA, DD, Phd
159463176X|1.0|This review is for the audio book production only as I have not finished the actual recording. (The book could be great, but I won't be finishing it.)<br /><br />The first narrator is acceptable, but when the second male voice joins in, his thick accent is horribly distracting. Perhaps that approach for a few lines to add depth to a character would work, but his voice/accent is simply not something you can listen to over a long period. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of audio books. This is the first time the narration was so distracting I had to give up. What a shame to spend that much money on something and only hear the first hour.<br /><br />Buy the book, but skip the audio. You'll be disappointed.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Just finished season 1 and am starting season 2, always keeps me on the edge of my seat. Check it out!

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A deeply moving account of a remarkable man and his family. I don`t have the words to adequately describe it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great character development and can hardly wait until Season 4!  It was great missing all the commercials and not having to wait week to week.
B008B3H4VQ|1.0|Their first 2 albums were great, then they just started going so soft.  Whose idea was that?? Why did they do a 180 and turned real fruity?? They use to have such a unique sound with great cuts with the blend of hip hop and rock. Now they sounds like girls. it's like they tried to go back to their roots of what brought them here and then just flamed out. I wouldn't by this piece of junk
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A magical, comic romp through a home for retired musicians.....................for any one aging ( isn't that all of us?) not tomention glorius music.
6305428050|5.0|Love the music and the story.  It is funny and an adveturous story about growing up and about a crazy babysitting gig.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I recently started watching this series. I'd heard it was great but didn't know the storyline, so we tried it one night when we had nothing else to watch. Initially he was skeptical, but we both love the series.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|My first Neil Gaiman book and I enjoyed it.  It had whimsy & horror combined in the same format.  The problem was that too many questions were left unanswered.
030758836X|5.0|I was intrigued, then frightened, next excited and worried.  An amazingly well-constructed novel.  I had to take breaks to absorb everything.

B0023SDPS6|4.0|My title pretty much says it all.  I watched the TV program, and decided to read the first book.  The author has a strange sense of humor, but most cops have that, and the main character is certainly a cop.  The character sees things a normal person might say are impossible... Perhaps, perhaps not.<br />If you like a story with twist on twist; to learn more about the TV characters, and laugh in unexpected places.  Read this.
B005BE79YA|3.0|I read the book and saw the film 40 years ago, and just re-read the book and re-saw the film. I enjoyed both the first time around. On rereading the book, I was struck by Hesse's complex and subtle reworking of the origins and meaning of Buddhism. As he said somewhere, the perspective of the book is actually closer to Taoism than to the Buddha's teaching (more harmonization of life than detachment from the world). On re-watching the film just after rereading the book, I was struck by how the closely the script kept to the book, including many key scenes and lines. Moreover, the actors are faithful to the book and the cinematography and plot are faithful in spirit. But I could not escape the feeling that the book simply could not be compressed into a film. The book itself is so concise and includes so much meditation on the meaning of things. So much is left out of the film that all the subtlety is gone. Hesse worked hard to overcome the negativity of the idea of detachment while still honoring the wisdom of Buddhism's critique of worldliness (recall that Buddhism followed \\"the middle way,\\" not the extremes of asceticism). Hesse sought a subtle dialectic between the sharp concision of the Four Noble Truths and Lao Tzu's more gentle, forgiving approach to life. All that is lost in the film, which sounds at the end too much like the cliches of the New Age would-be gurus.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|All those famous British actors in one place - lots of laughs and a glorious finale, fitted to the entire group of retired musicians - great opera!  We are not opera fans but this was terrific!
B00CXQL828|5.0|Very nice - bluesy, heavy-edge tunes, great singing, and enough virtuosity to keep it interesting. Great to see these three together being a long-time fan of each individually.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was great, I tell people about it all the time.  I am certain it will be a movie one day and am sure it will be a good movie, but like most movies it will never hold a candle to the book.  There is no way it will go into as much detail as he does on the training it takes to be a SEAL and the conditions he was in.  It’s a must read!
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Really enjoyed it, it is easy to watch and very entertaining! First season is a bit better though but both are very good.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This has made it on my favorite book list. I thought this book was going to be really boring, but it was really awesome! I like that it leaves you wondering how all of these things happen, but I seem to like books like that.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Would like to watch it again and really pay more attention to it.  it was not what i was expecting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved everything about it!  Suspense erotica romance thrill and mystery. Would love to read through Christians perspective! I highly recommend this series
B0063IH60K|5.0|Allows more options than most.  Still a challenge but more rewarding when one is successful more often. Solitaire is a singular game after all!  Thanks!
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|Love the cast Colin and the lady were great!<br />Movie was full of action and suspense great story line.<br />Highly recommend!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book keeps you guessing to the very end. Definitely a page turner and it kept me up into the wee hours of the night. I read it right after Gone Girl which I highly recommend. I am certainly hooked on Gillian Flynn and will be downloading her other book ASAP as well as everything she writes in the future. She is no one hit wonder!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Great characterization, terrific plot, beautiful writing.  The story is at once heart-breaking and inspirational in the depth and growth of the characters. An absolute must-read!
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|It's been a while since I purchased this DVD and I only watched it once.  I've since given it away.  Here's why.<br /><br />One might think that with such an 'incendiary' title, this movie might have a high energy storyline, or at least some shocking elements...  Something!  However, there is virtually nothing interesting or entertaining about this film, at least, not for me...<br /><br />After pushing around some scrawny \\"models\\" an equally scrawny David Hemmings notices something odd in one (or some) of his photos that was taken outdoors. He then proceeds to make some enlargements (or Blow Ups) of the image to get a closer look.  That's it!  That's the whole movie, sans the whimsy.  There's also some nonsense about a group of weirdos riding around in (and ON) a car, clown style (that is, 15 or 20 people packed into a small car).<br /><br />Hemmings obsessive attempts to discern just exactly what his camera has captured lead to nothing.  The question of whether or not there WAS a murder is never answered.<br /><br />The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because I enjoyed Director Brian De Palma's \\"Blow Out\\", a film that has been described as \\"inspired by\\" or \\"loosely based on\\" \\"BLOW-UP\\".  But \\"Blow Out\\" was an unrelenting shocker that had great characters and a stunning story.  Much better than this boring thing.<br /><br />BLOW UP.<br /><br />Worse than \\"American Beauty\\"<br />Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Loved the girl in this movie she had a lot of depth for such a young character.  Lots of action and not predictible which I liked.
B00A1OZBSQ|5.0|I would recommend it to all my friends though most of them will not take the time to read it.  I used it as a life changing vehicle after reaching a better understanding of my eating problems which I hope I will not fall back into. It really helped me to understand the element of addiction that was part of my eating and while it is only a short while since I read it I can say that for now I got read of this addiction...yes - sugar, fat and salt.  It is also very well written.<br /><br />Micha Karpfen
B00AJFEHAU|5.0|My granddaughter asked me to order this for her. She was thrilled with it. I gave my niece one too.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This is a movie I could watch over and over again.  The cast is amazing and does a wonderful job.  Everyone has a beautiful voice and you can feel the emotion.  I even had a guy friend watch it with me and he loved it.  This is a great movie!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|The Angry Bird games are fun to play and are usually a challenge.  Also keeps my grandchildren busy trying to see if they can beat me
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book!!  Very great read for all relationships. A lot of insight into self and relationships. Don't have to have a struggling relationship to read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love all the decorating ideas people share on here!! the DIY projects are amazing, going to try a bunch soon
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I listened to the audio book version while following along inside with the kindle version, and it was really easy to follow. The first part is given over in the form of a story. I can listen to the book every few months again, as there is so much to internalize. I strongly agree with the authors approach and recommend everyone read this book. It was worth every cent!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Detailed and honest. He talks about his struggle with birth family, dismissing faith and even admits using LSD as a youth. I have four stars only because it was a bit too technical for me in describing brain and body stuff.  But his purpose is to bring the spiritual side of people into mainstream medical validity so I understand why the in depth doctor talk. Glad I read it, gave me lots to think about and some insight too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I chose the high rating because I really felt it was excellent and enjoyed watching it. Thank you for the opportunity of allowing me to  express my enjoyment of the 3rd season.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This was so fun I just can't stop playing the game and I can't wait to see the next game that come was out.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I laughed out loud throughout the entire thing! So much funnier than Bridesmaids in my opinion! Definitely a must see!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is a very fun game. It has two very awesome things: pudding and monsters. Its very fun to slide the monsters around to make fun shapes. I do have one dislike though: It gets very hard to get earn three stars on levels. All in all its a very fun game and I enjoy it a lot.
1781162646|5.0|Couldn't put it down....what more can be said?  Great twist at the end, I didn't see it coming until later on.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|First book is very addicting. Can't stop reading. It's the second series of novels I enjoyed reading so far. Would recommend this series to anyone who loves to read romantic/ exotic/fantasy novels.
B009CFYRCG|5.0|The Coen Brothers masterpiece continues to abide almost 20 years after its initial release. Perfectly ridiculous characters full of aggression that will not stand, this film is best enjoyed with a steady stream of White Russians. Enjoy.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I was first introduced to Doctor Who by a friend. I decided to give it a try and I fell in love. I have always been sort of a nerd/geek; so this was perfect for me. I am starting the second season now and I still love it.<br /><br />(Slight Spoiler Alert) This show is about a man called The Doctor. He is an alien called a Timelord. He travels through time in a blue public call box. The setting is London England for the first episode. (The others are scattered around the universe.) The show starts with one of the main characters; Rose Tyler (Billie Piper).<br /><br />I would probably recommend this show for someone probably age 12+ Just because it is good for young audiences doesn't mean it isn't great for adults; though. Now, there is some swearing and some parts that may be inappropriate for young ages; so watch out. I would recommend this show very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|As good as the one I play on Xbox but much more portable.... haven't tried it on my kindle yet but that's next
1250006341|5.0|I have really enjoyed this gorgeous book.  I have also given a copy to a friend as a gift.  I would highly recommend this book for Downton Abbey fans.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I am satisfied and happy with this product because it accomplish with all my expectations and needs. Thanks a lot,.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I no longer remember the details, but I learned a lot about the culture of the geographical area and its people.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|best game really good I thinks it is crap it requires twenty word minimum review though other than that it is a really fun and easy game with great story line and graphics
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Great writing and character development continues!<br />They blend in new characters over time without loosing the story's bottom line theme. Still makes me laugh and cry on the roller coaster of life.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for next season.  This one certainly ended with a cliff-hanger.  I just don't do anything lame in the next season, a la American television cliff-hangers.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Wow.. There is just nothing bad to say about this game other then guns being way over priced! DEFINETLY A MUST GET!
B00571F26Y|2.0|Waste of my time and money for a theory. It drug on and on and never came to a real point and no actual proof.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the author's characterization of Amy and her \\"quirks\\".  Then there's average Nick...both great character studies.  And both characters deserved a better ending.  It didn't need an exact precise conclusive conclusion...but I don't think the story stopped at the correct spot...just frustrating.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game for all ages and it is great for wanna be horse riders. It makes you feel as if your horse is real and gives you a great experience.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I was not a Twilight fan when the movies came out. The 1st one came on tv one day & I watched it. After that I kept having to borrow friends movies so I can continue to watch. Now I have all 5 & can watch when ever I want!!
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for a baby shower. The book is clever and I am sure Daddy Darth will like it. Book arrived on time and n excellent condition. .
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This series is a combination of science fiction meets mystery all with romantic leanings.  It's addictive to see what happens next, what &#34;troubles&#34; manifest and how they are resolved.  Characters are very much like everyday people and after a few chapters become very likable.  At times lighthearted and times very bizarre.  We came in sometime at the end of season one and had to go back to start at the beginning to find the missing pieces.  Well worth it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Still enjoyable in free mode. I really like it. The pace is kind of slow though.  I will definitely try the new version.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I was not a Twiclight fan when the movies cam out. The 1st one cam on tv one day & I watched it. After that I kept having to borrow others movies that owned so I can continue to watch. Now I have all 5 & can watch when ever I want!!
B005LAIGLO|5.0|amazing good cast, mark was good as always, fighting for his life and family, the end will keept you at you eat
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love this game, but I don't like the advertisements. I'm easily entertained for HOURS because I'm stilling having a hard time advancing for a 26 yr old, it's quality.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it, hated it, and couldn't put it down!  Sick puppies, these two very co-dependent people.  Very interesting read, lots of suspense.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much it's so addictive I can't stop playing it I think its way better than subway surfers by far
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Sweet story.  At least no shooting, f bombs, car chases, etc., like most movies recently.  Great that the actual people the story was about also were actors in this movie.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This Rollins characters are great. The suspense began with the first page and continued to the end. SIGMA is headed for a adventure soon, I hope.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|restaurant story is a fun and addicting game. I cant stop playing this game. you will love playing bakery story too.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|A classic, don't even watch the re-make. I love this movie even watching it today I still enjoy the suspense and storytelling of this mystery and horror movie.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|I was excited to see this because I adore Gemma. I was not impressed with the ending (not their fault) The acting was good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! You should totally try it. It had all of the cute minions and is very close to the movie. It even includes the fluffy unicorn
1781162646|3.0|The book was pretty slow moving and only got interesting around the last 3/4 or 7/8 of the book. It didn't grab my attention as much as his other books have.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Now, I won't spoil it for you but it's a great horror movie with a great twist on the true subject matter at hand, Anyone interested in the occult should watch it, keep in mind there is some Hollywood thrown in. Great scares! And a sequel Fall 2013!
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|thank you for having this cd and easy for me to order it early and get it early and make it easy for me to get it without out having to go to the mall and I haven'nt heard it yet but I have a feeling it's good. I love her music now. she' s worth it.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A lot of fun to be had in this spy farce.  A really impressive cast that delivers action, humor, and suspense.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Started strong but just dragged. I think the narrative got caught in it's own attempts to be clever. Ended up being tiresome.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I never got into this show back when it started but all my friends did. Recently, I saw some scenes before Beauty and the Beast (its on before it starts) and I liked what I saw. So I bought the box sets 1-3, 4 comes out in September :(<br />And I have to say I LOVE this show, its my latest obsession, Team DELENA!
B008N1V11U|5.0|Well done. great graphics, easy to learn and fun to take the role of Gotham's Dark Knight.<br />I'm ready to play again.
0060853972|5.0|Great story with nice changes in POV's . Overall worth the read and if you love Neil Gaiman you're sure to love this.
B0012Y22KO|5.0|...these are truly spectacular recordings that are dynamically uncompressed (ref. the \\"Dynamic Range Database\\" at DR dot Loudness-War dot info).  As far as pop/rock discs go, the seven CDs (and one DVD-V) represented here are almost unsurpassed in quality of production and quality of mastering.  In addition, I have to say that they sound absolutely spectacular on my rather high-end sound reproduction system.<br /><br />If you are looking for ear-bud iPod music that's been squashed into oblivion, you are in the wrong place.  I'd rate all the discs--save perhaps the first couple of titles--as high 9s on a scale of 10 in terms of sound quality, and the remaining two as \\"very good\\".<br /><br />In fact, the only discs that come to mind with greater fidelity and higher dynamic range are perhaps \\"James Newton Howard and Friends\\" (...the \\"friends\\" actually are Toto backing up...) by Sheffield Labs, and perhaps a few other very select titles.<br /><br />If you like Toto, you will be thrilled with these first seven albums.  I'd rate this a \\"best buy\\".  Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very easy to  play and easy to customize app which just gives you the classic game of solitaire without complications. If you're just looking for the one game done simply and very well, this is a great one.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Why is Amazon so slow with getting apps for Kindle fire? No one wants a cheat guide. We all know how to play, we just want to play on our kindles.
B005544V6A|5.0|much better then i expected. its witty and sharp with not to much negativeity or trying to do to much or provocative. it seems these days shows try to shock you and just get weird and therefore people think its creative.  this show is straightforward...the characters are sharp the dialogue is witty.  just a great show
B000VMFDW2|5.0|A look at changing strategy and a military slow to cope on the little know fight on Peleliu. Wish I could find dozen more books this good.
B005544V6A|5.0|Those guys are a hoot!  Glad there's more than one season. It's so much better than a lot of stuff available.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Dean is my 7 1/2 yr old grandson. He loves this game on my Kindle Fire HD. Runs great! Keeps him busy & he's learning learns lot.
0765325950|5.0|This book was a great ending to an excellent series!  Could see more books being written if Jordan's wife would ok
B0084U0IEG|4.0|My motivation to read the book was the \\"MI5\\" connection. However, because most of the book was about literary matters, laced with somewhat entertaining descriptions of the heroine's emotion's, introspections, and sex life experiences, it became obvious that it be better appreciated and of more interest to others than to me. And yet, the book kept my interest mostly because of the survivor's compelling style of writing.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Man of Steel highlights just how far special effects have come since the 1978 Superman film. In Man of Steel, Superman really looks like a man suspended in flight, compared to the 1978 film, where Superman looks like he is suspended in front of a jittery screen. In addition, there are plenty of explosions, CGI-laden battles and an epic bad guy showdown--in short, everything you'd expect from a big-budget summer blockbuster. On the downside, there was a great deal of product placement in the movie. The Daily Planet is not a real newspaper, so why do the businesses need to be real? Some of the ads are downright intrusive, so much so that they momentarily stall the action. The worst ad appears toward the end of the movie, when Superman takes off into the air from a street. When this happens, the camera doesn't follow Superman's path; instead, it stays focused on the street. Now, why did the audience need to see that shot? Why didn't the camera immediately follow Superman? Obviously, the director wanted the audience to see a Sears store on the street, even though that put a temporary lull in the action. That was such a blatant product placement that some people in the audience laughed. There were also some odd scenes involving Lois Lane. What was she doing aboard a military aircraft carrying a special weapon designed to kill the bad guys? She's a reporter, not a bombardier. And when an alien small arm fell into her hands, how did she know how to fire it? Lois Lane should have played a minor role in the film, since she doesn't investigate Superman until Clark Kent is working at the Daily Planet. Overall, MOS is a flawed but entertaining movie.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|DO NOT WASTE THE TIME TO DOWNLOAD THIS APP. It crashes the moment you try to watch a video. The web version on the Fire HD has some bugs but not as many as this. It needs a fix ASAP.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this app. it kept me entertained for an evening.keep up the good work. thank you! works great on my kindle!

B00CF34B2I|4.0|played the game long time ago with actual cards. I think the digital version is a lot easier to learn and you don't need another uber nerd to play.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|I have this blu ray from amazon uk before so i brought this one for my brother. But when he receives this blu ray he ask me why thai subtitle is missing although amazon said that it included. Could you tell me what can i do and where can i find this series with thai subtitl.<br /><br />best regards,
B00BTV62KG|5.0|After you get past the first two tracks, which I am pretty sure were produced for college radio airplay with almost no improvisational moments, this CD pretty much explodes with funkiness and stellar guitar soloing from Scofield. The bass is so utterly in your face without eating up the mix of the whole record that it's really remarkable, and Avi shows why there really IS such a thing as a rhythm guitar player who is not doing it just because he's not good enough to play a solo - he's in a class by himself. I consider the original Uberjam CD to be like the modern &#34;Kind Of Blue&#34; that defined a new direction of bringing in the modern music of the culture while still being true to the spirit of jazz, so it was fantastic to get another helping that was just as good.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Delightful, from beginning to end. Well written, well crafted. LOVED the characters. It is light without being silly, intelligent without being stuffy. What can I say? This book is a standout!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|Jen and Brad did a great job, but I didn't think the movie was as great as everyone else said it was. Was a little slow, weird story plots, very weird dance scene.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I dont know why I waited so long to read this.  I have NEVER read another book like this. For me it wasn't even all about the steamy sex scenes, the story line ignited something in me that had me hooked. I couldnt put the book down. I would tell anyone to purchase this trilogy.....i intend to read it again.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a veteran teacher and the author of, [[ASIN:1432724533 Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom]], understanding what makes kids tick is my stock in trade.  Building relationships as best I can is how I manage my classroom.  Trust me, it beats screaming.  I found this book to be a great resource for understanding the introvert child.  After finishing the book, I began to rethink my emphasis on group work.  Team building and collaboration are the trend.  We preach to the kids that this is how the world works.  And it's true.  Sometimes.  Now, when assigning group work, a new job in each group is the \\"thinker.\\"  It is the thinker's job to talk less and think more.  It is the role given to introverts, usually.  Sometimes the thinker takes the information and goes off on his or her own for a while, before contributing to the group dynamics.  I have found it to be a very effective way to get these kids to participate.  Once the introvert no longer feels as if they are on stage, the filter is lowered and they sometimes contribute much more.  Too often we view participation as talking.  Once the definition is broadened, the introvert has an equal opportunity to shine.  It is also interesting to see less introverted kids want to be the thinker and begin to value quiet reflection.
B009CG25RO|5.0|There isn't anything I can say that hasnt been said before about this movie. If you havent seen it yet, you will not be disappointed.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. So clever, great art, great story, love the quick one liners.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|**WARNING**SPOILERS**<br />I am not sure how I feel about this book. On one hand, I do feel that Jodi Picoult is a talented writer and she definitely has a way of capturing a reader. But at the same time, she is very much into details and some details are just, well boring. There were some parts I just skimmed over because the details just werent important to the novel. The one thing that really bothers me about this novel tho is the fact that Emily Gold is so pathetic. Ok, she got rubbed up in a bathroom for 5 minutes by some creep. Yes that can be a very traumatic experience and no doubt she should have told someone and received some sort of therapy. But for that to be the catalyst of her suicide...give me a break. Her character was extrememly selfish, self-centered, and weak. If you truly love someone, you would not think to ask that person to do something that would ruin them emotionally, mentally, and literally for the rest of their lives. Chris was so blinded by his love and attraction for her that he didnt realize until the very end how badly Emily screwed up his life.<br />Another thing is the ending feels incomplete. I understand that endings arent always easy to write, but I feel that the book could have ended with a better epilogue, maybe showing Chris as a grown man and letting us see a snippet of how his life was effected by the events, or finding a lost letter from Emily where he finds out the \\"truth\\" of her incestuous feelings towards him and the childhood bathroom incident. Something to give him some closure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love a game that challenges you and makes you think! I was addicted to playing this right away! You'll have a lot of fun!
B000SP1SEO|4.0|This was one of those movies I watched not knowing what to expect. Needless to say I really enjoyed it and would easily watch it again.
1439163154|4.0|It was different, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you want to, definitely pick it up. Read it. You might enjoy it as much as I did.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|when they say it can fit into your pocket  it  can i though i would be able to fit my bigger knifes in there but i guess not.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Boring. Same tired old formula film. Expected more. Predictable plot and the acting was not inspiring. Would not recommend it.
B008Y76VW2|1.0|I would have been really mad if I actually paid for this movie. Did not even bother watching the whole thing....it lost me right from the start.
B0041OT9W6|2.0|This book was meh. It was detailed but im just not into this stuff. I only read it for school.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Its fun but frustrating to play.  My grandchildren play it frequently.  Not sure that I would purchase again if I would have had an chance to play before purchasing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is a great show and the actors do a great job with their roles.  Each episode has a different twist but it shows humor and the fact they usually end up doing what's best for the client.  Harvey and Mike are so much alike but complement each other.  I thoroughly enjoyed session one and session two.  It's great that I can catch up with amazon prime and roku.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I saw this advertised on TV and thought it would be interesting.  I was so delighted at how much I enjoyed it.  You will be hooked.  I've recommended it to many of my friends.  Finally, something worth watching.

B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I love Gaiman, funnily enough I discovered him through the book he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett, The Good Omen, and have been reading practically everything he has written, this book draws you in and does not let you go. I am not going to summarize it, but if you like well-written fantasy this is the book for you.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I bought two of these to build separate PCs, one windows 7 and one XP. They are really fast and stable. I couldn't ask for more for the price. Excellente!!!!

B005K17RU0|4.0|The forecasts are usually right on.  This app helps me plan my day.  I especially like how I can add locations and see the weather in different parts of the country and state.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|brutally funny, it flips traditional horror tropes onto their heads. A horror comedy well worth watching. I highly recommend it.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|that's about it.  A good movie to watch on a weeknight when nothing is on TV.  Good Luck and Have fun Watching.
1938469003|4.0|2/3rd of the book related to the history of IPA.  The receipes at the end are pretty good and I will try many, but missing Pliny the Elder clone is a problem for me.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|My kids love this game... my older sons are 20 (twins) and my younger son is 12, and they play it a lot... I even like it, it has a refreshing gameplay to it.
B004U8VWIM|1.0|I heard great things about this movie, and had high hopes. It was very predictable. The only part that was not predictable was all the sex with two women. Don't waste you time, and make sure your kids are not in the room.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Very unusual view of what happened to the original Hansel and Gretel and the way they turned out.  I am not sure of using crossbow and shotgun occurred at the same time.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|The author has definitely had an offbeat life, but because the memoir does little beyond conveying the details of that life, there are no broader lessons to be drawn.  Personally, I found the narrator self-absorbed and uninteresting, and wasn't sympathetic to her struggles.  I didn't learn much about the PCT, either.  Bill Bryson does a  better job of it with &#34;A Walk in the Woods&#34;--he's much better company, a much better writer, and much better informed about the trail he's hiking.<br /><br />If you liked &#34;Eat, Pray, Love,&#34; you might like &#34;Wild&#34;; if, like me, you found that book intolerable, steer clear--&#34;Wild&#34; is more of the same.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Great acting between the leads (Naomi and Colin) along with excellent chemistry.  Good action, the trailer is misleading but I will say its a solid B movie elevated to A by the actors! Rent it and enjoy!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Glad the movie was completely different.  The entire book, which was very long, was an interview!  Not exciting or suspenseful, just long & boring.  Thought I was never going to finish & when I did, I felt let down. Go see the movie but don't waste your time on this book.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I keep coming back to this as it is basically funny.  The people are real and believable and carry the story well.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Regarding the power, the description specifically informs that a USB power cable is included with the item.  People who believe in the impossible: read the fine print, do your research!<br /><br />I have apps on my TV, too, but they are difficult to use, and I can only use my game controller on one tv at a time.  This way I can easily move from TV to TV.  I can't wait to try it!<br /><br />Four stars because I have to buy it...
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I think Mad Men can appeal to people on both a superficial and deep level.  It's sexy, but it's also really deep.  Season One has some amazing writing, storytelling and visuals that really are brilliant.  Unfortunately, season six is not as smart.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Fast, quick read but still has a little of the suspense & magic of the old Stephen King books. I'm a fan so read all his books, not his best work, but still a good read.
B000WITSZS|5.0|I like it a lot, I can listen through the whole thing and still want more when done, and never skip a song.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I really enjoy this show...it has a great cast and is just hilarious...watch it and you'll get hooked! I know I did!
0385474547|5.0|I remember reading this book as an English major for my African Literature class and was so moved!  It's years hence, and when I read it a second time, I was equally as riveted.  Everyone should read this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Why can't I share with my friends any more  I redo the game and lost my scores AM pissed.cannot log on with Facebook
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer so that I could have enjoyed it for a longer period of time.
0978545095|5.0|Vivien was right up there with all of the famous photographers of the era - a shame that she wasn't recognized during her life time
0812973992|4.0|I bought this book for a book club assignment, and it was really interesting.  There were parts that I felt dragged on and/or were confusing.  The book club didn't help clarify my confusion.  But it is enjoyable &#34;high&#34; reading.  Not summer hammock reading.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love to play it when I'm bored and it great for the kids on long trips. if u r reading the review I advise u to download this app and the best part about it is that it is FREE!!!!
B00008RH1H|5.0|One of the most outstanding works of Japanese cinema.  This movie portrays how samurai worked, lived, and went to war.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Get ready to Google &#34;Altzheimer's disease&#34;  while you're reading this.  Engrossing story, good characters, worth the time. Glad I read it.
1400052181|5.0|I learned about this book from a former professor who had an expert come in for a &#34;talk&#34; at her school.  The expert spoke from teh scientific side, but the professor was an English professor.  This is a very interesting read from a historical, cultural and scientific standpoint.  It's a book that anyone can enjoy.
0142000655|2.0|This book was OVER USED and price is not good for the quality. It is better to buy a new one than this used one.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Sanderson had a new fan in me. I've already finished The Final Empire and on to book 2. The magic in this series is so different from any other fantasy I've read. Very cleverly done.
B00BESCJII|4.0|This is a wonderful coming of age movie with some good life lessons about the importance of being yourself.  My daughter and I enjoyed it very much and were able to talk about the themes throughout the story.  Good conversation starter for some of those difficult-to-bring-up topics.  Nice movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I would recommend anyone that is into office politics to watch Suits. Great writing and great acting. I am in love with Donna! Yea!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Fits my 17&#34; laptop perfectly, love it.  It seems like a durable bag and will hold up for a long time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I loved all the new updates with lots of dragons. I have accomplished a lot and plan to play more. I would recomed this to anyone
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Got her at a great price and my nieces love the fact that her eyes glow in the dark...By far the coolest thing ever!!!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|My husband wanted this CD so we bought it. He played it in the car and I didn't really like it at all except for Sea of Love and Graceless.<br />As I've listened to it more and especially as I've read the lyrics, I've grown to appreciate it a lot more. It's very well put together (my husband likes the driving drumming that pulses through every song) and I like that as an older artist the singer has a lot more to say about life and pain.<br />It's not a cheery album but it is very deep and touching.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I will not go into much detail here.The graphics were great,the story line was great,and the movie was awsum,\\"my opinion\\".I did not see it in the thearter,i saw it at home the day it came out in the movies. My brother works in hollywood.The day the movie is ready for release in the movies the studios have the dvd copy locked in warehouses.i recieved a legit box set (legal box set),not a pirated burn.Buy this movie,you will dot be disapointed.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you remember the 80's with fondness or lived through the evolution of games, this book is for you. A quirky love story and a brilliant underdog to root for make this book a winner.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I already have an Apple TV and have been seriously looking at getting a Roku Box to attach to the other television in the bedroom, but then I watched Google announce this little beauty. It is only 35 dollars and ultra-portable, so you could definitely buy two or three and then take one with you on trips to use in a hotel or at a friend's place while you are away. All it takes is an hdmi port (common on most HDTV's made in the last several years) and a WiFi connection and you are ready to get streaming. This piece of hardware is also unique in that you won't need to replace it with newer hardware, just upgrade the software as it becomes available! This is what Apple should have released years ago! A wonderful product and cheap enough to justify the cost for all the TV's in your house. Get ready to stream netflix, pandora, and anything you want from your Chrome Browser! A must have.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I like that this album has much more singing and vocal work than their others have. I also like the funk influence that you get in most of the songs.<br />I think &#34;Touch&#34; is the definite low point of the album (especially since it goes on forever!) but all of the other songs (except maybe the very last one) are very well rounded and fun to listen to.<br />My favorite songs are &#34;Within&#34; (I love how haunting and lovely it is) and &#34;Doin' It Right&#34; (it's just a lot of fun to listen to!).<br />I would definitely encourage anyone to buy it whether you have bought anything by them before or not!
B0018BB20W|5.0|The original version was much better than the expanded, re-recorded version on CD, with bonus tracks and more. At least run the CD like the song list suggests. Instead, they ruin &#34;the day&#34;, by inserting these bonus tracks and other songs in between &#34;the day&#34;, thus ruining the concept/theme of &#34;a day and night&#34;. This CD leaves me with the thought that I need to locate an original version on vinyl or cassette format.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I liked the Fifth Wave better. I think some of this is just a little dated as it was originally written many years ago.  However, movie is coming out so interested in that.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fantastic characters, beautiful storyline.  It was simply just too short, I read it all in one long sitting.  Well done Neil!
B006S086AM|3.0|If you are an Eisenberg and Steward fan, you will enjoy the movie. If you are not, you won't. the movie is slow in some places but overall not bad.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the characters, I love the storylines, I love everything about the show.<br />Rachel is gorgeous, Donna is very attractive with just the right amount of sassiness.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love to create things and get armour on survival i hope theres more updates because they are awesome and cool
B00DU73T08|4.0|I enjoyed the book so the movie was a fun extension. The actors were good and that helped a slower styled movie.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So pretty to look at; and fun to play. My three year old son loves to help me collect the sand dollars.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I LOVE IT. Nothing can be determined early. The characters are great . REACHER  is unabashed kick ass. The female side kick isn't a wimp . There are UK scenes well described and Reacher leaves without his woman. The universe is balanced, if not safe.
0525478817|5.0|How can you not be pulled into a book where, from the first word, you are laughing so hard you are crying? Or is that crying so hard you're laughing? Both apply here.<br /><br />At first glance...yes. Seems maudlin, maybe. And yes, so brilliant.<br /><br />This is John Greene: he will make you laugh and cry and search your soul and find corners of yourself that you did not know existed. Don't come to this table wanting the Happily Ever After bubble. There are other books for that. But they won't make you laugh as hard. Like belly-pain laughter. And they won't change the way you see the world.<br /><br />Those HEA books are safe. This is not safe. But it is infinitely more rewarding.<br /><br />Even if you've lost friends like this.<br />Especially if you've lost friends like this.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|If fighting romance and love are your thing, you'll love this book. It's an easy read and I purchased it for what it was knowing it would satisfy my need to read something along this genre. Good beach book.
B00DW36G32|4.0|IT WAS PRETTY GOOD MOVIE. YOU HAVE A RETIRED CAPTAIN THAT TOOK PART IN THE BALKAN WAR AS PART OF A NATO INTERVENTION WHEN SERBIA, STARTED TAKING OVER BOSNIA, CROATIA AS THE COUNTRY OF YUGOSLAVIA, STARTED DISOLVING AND CIVIL WAR BEGAN AS SOON AS THE STRONG MAN TITO DIED AFTER SO MANY YEARS IN POWER RULING.  YOU GET TO SEE SOME GRUSOME SCENES AT TIMES, NOT MUCH,  WHEN DE NIRO'S FLASHES BACK AND IT TAKES YOU TO THE TIME OF ETHNIC CLEANSING SERBIANS WERE DOING, BUT THEY DON'T SHOW MUCH OF IT, LIKE IN &#34;SCHINDLER'S LIST&#34; ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST!.<br />THEN YOU HAVE TRAVOLTA WHO AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF SEARCHING AFTER HE WAS HURT WHEN HE WAS PART OF A GROUP OF MEN THAT NATO SOLDIERS LINED UP TO SHOOT IN BACK OF THE HEAD AND DE NIRO WAS PART OF THEM, BUT COULD NOT GO THRU WITH IT, SO ENDS UP SHOOTING HIM, BUT NOT DEAD. TRAVOLTA SPENDS MOST OF HIS LIFE SEARCHING FOR DE NIRO AND TRAVELS TO AMERICA, WHERE HE'S LOOKING FOR REVENGE OF HIS FAMILY GETTING KILLED DURING THE WAR, SO WANTED A GAME A CAT AND MOUSE WITH DE NIRO IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE DE NIRO HAD RETIRED TO. TRAVOLTA TRIES TO DO A PRETTY GOOD ACCENT THRU THE MOVIE AND I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITH IT AS I COULD NOT REALLY TELL HOW THEY TALK ANYWAY. THERE WAS A GOOD SCRIPT AND DIRECTION AS WELL OF COURSE AS GOOD ACTING FROM THE BOTH OF THEM. NOT SO MUCH OF A BIG CAST, MOVIE IS MOSTLY THEM TWO AND SOME SUPPORTING ACTING AS DE NIRO'S SON AND HIS WIFE THAT HAD A BABY BUT DE NIRO HAD NOT YET MET, DUE TO HIS DISTANCING FROM THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND CONTINUAL REFUSAL TO SEE THEM, PART THAT WAS NOT EXPLAINED WELL ENOUGH, OTHER THAN HIS GUILT FOR BEING PART OF NATO DURING THAT WAR AND ASHAMED OF THINGS THEY ASKED HIM TO DO AND THE KILLING HE SAW ALL THOSE YEARS!  DO NOT REMEMBER THIS FILM MAKING IT TO THE VIEWING AUDIENCE IN THATRRES AND IF IT DID, IT WASN'T IN MANY CITIES. COMES OUT AT THE END OF AUGUST SOMETIMES, AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL ONLY NOW. I RECOMMENDED. (BUT THEN AGAIN, MOST ANYTHING DE NIRO IS PART OF I LIKE TO SEE! )SEE! )
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I Love all of the hard to find videos on this app. I enjoy watching videos that I couldn't find elsewhere.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I think it is a fantastic way to access quickly to your favourites videos to and to watch interesting videos
B00CXG8Z1K|5.0|If you love Nat King Cole's music and style, then this is the album for you!  No one can replace Mr. Cole, but George has done an excellent job putting together all time favorites and singing it.  I sometimes could not tell the difference between the two singers.  George has put his majic touch to the songs as only George can do.  His spin on all the songs helps introduce younger listeners to the classic Nate King Cole.
B00DM0YE9S|3.0|A RUSSIAN SUBMARINE THAT GOES ROGUE TO HAVE CHINA AND THE USA START WWIII WITHOUT THE CAPTAIN KNOWING. (ED HARRIS).  THE SCRIPT WAS A BIT WEAK AND THE STORY HAS BEEN TOLD BEFORE IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND BETTER ( NOT CHINA VS USA BUT USA VS USSR, DURING COLD WAR) &#34;HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER&#34; WITH SEAN CONNERY. ED HARRIS IS A PRETTY GOOD ACTOR AND I ACTUALLY LIKE HIS ROLES, HE DID THE BEST HE COULD I GUESS WITH THE SCRIPT HE HAD. DAVID DOCHOVNY, NOT SURE ABOUT HIM, EVERY TIME I SEE HIM, I KEEP THINKING AN ALIEN IS ABOUT TO SHOW UP OR SOMETHING, FROM THE X-FILES.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Superb acting.  Wonderful to watch.<br />Dialog is so smart.  Stories are just so interesting.<br />Gives you such a real feeling for the times.
