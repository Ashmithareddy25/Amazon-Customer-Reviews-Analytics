B003H4I4JU|4.0|I first read this as a teen. Now that I'm older I am much better equipped to enjoy the philosophical depth that the younger me just skimmed.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love this series, it is so romantic so if you need something light and entertaining I can thoroughly recommend it!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I must say that I am more pleasantly surprised by this game than I ever thought I would be.  For people who like puzzles, it works a lot like Chuzzle, but here the matches have very defined purposes.  It also appeals to the upgrade hound in me because you basically get to upgrade things and become cooler as you keep playing.  At first the graphics were crappy, but then they became retro because the old graphics hide a very good game (to the point where it feels like the old 8-bit style is intentional).  I would absolutely recommend this game!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A good &#34;coming-of-age&#34; meets &#34;time travel and horror&#34; meets &#34;suspense&#34; genre.  I thought the characters well-drawn and some of the mystery was left to the imagination.  I'm looking forward to reading the continued adventures of this group of &#34;suspended in time&#34; teens.
B00BSHVSQ4|4.0|If you are a die-hard Eagles fan I suppose so - beautiful packaging [and much larger than I was expecting] and nice prints of the band at various stages in their career so would recommend for the die-hard fan that has to have everything from the Eagles
B00992CF6W|5.0|Lots of water and arches into bays great place to build lots of ship scenes. If you need to know about minecraft pe just go to the minecraft wiki. If i told you here it would be outdated too soon cause they update the game all the time. So instead If you want to download other people's maps for this game use pocket tool and utk both are free. My favorite part about this game over other phone games is that I don't have to wait for time to pass before whatever. I am loving the interface and the controls are great.... My first seed was SLURPEE it was recommended off of You Tube by some one... anyways I had to take the battery out of my phone and i lost that world..... So I started PIRATES been there since and I put the game on my wifes kindle so she plays with me from time to time when were both stuck in a waiting room.....
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|As an aspiring author, On Writing contains valuable tips for editing and construction, all wrapped around Stephen King's own life story.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|Horrible movie, didn't enjoy it at all.  Bought for a fun girls night and we couldn't even finish it, the movie was so bad! Sorry I wasted my money!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The Rosie Project is an amusing and poignant lesson in understanding ourselves, or rather when we need to stop trying to.
0307408833|1.0|I have been waiting a while to leave this review. I wanted to make sure I really cooked my way though this cookbook. At this point I have tried almost all of the recipes (including those in the Babycakes Covers the Classics). I am totally frustrated with Erin Mckenna's cookbooks and would love my money and time back. Why would you create a cookbook that has mediocre (and often times inedible) results in comparison to those available in your store?! I have spent so much time and SO much money (these recipes have very expensive ingredients) trying to recreate the yummy, heavenly sweets you can find in the Babycakes Bakeries. I am rather appalled that Erin McKenna chose not to reveal her recipes (or maybe she never tested them out)? I am an extremely competent cook and absolutely adore making desserts and have been doing so for over 25 years. Of course over those 25 years, I came across some recipes that didn't work as well as others, but I have never been as disappointed repeatedly from one single cookbook author until now. Since I found out I had an allergy to gluten, I was absolutely thrilled to hear Babycakes was coming out with a cookbook. But, it turns out that you cannot recreate these lovely cupcakes, sweet breads, and cakes in your own home using these books. Don't waste your money on the book. Rather, spend your money on ordering some sweets directly from the Babycakes store. I would suggest getting the book Jenni's Splendid Ice Cream at Home (she has a few sorbets if you are vegan) where the recipes ARE an exact replica of the desserts you can buy in Jenni's store, and oh my goodness they are damn good!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game for my kindle fire. I have played this game every day after i got it. You can get gems every day, so you never run out. Great game for anyone.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book and there is always less in the movie than the book but the acting was very good and what was told good.  That's why I gave it five stars.  I'll watch it over and over again.  I think I'll even read the book again.  The storyline is so true to life that my feelings went into it big time.  Not just the love connection but the hate and scared connections, too.  Watch and read the book and you'll see what I mean.  Thank you Mr. Sparks for being such a good story teller.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll keep this brief, there are many reviews, almost all very positive. There is an emotional depth to this series. Howey makes the reader care for his characters. Highly recommended, even for people who aren't big fans of the genre.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Martin left the ending hanging...  too any unknowns.  What happened to Rickon, Bran, Meera, Sansa, Caitlin?  Is Arya remaining in the temple?  Jon was murdered after learning that Stannus was defeated, but there was nothing in the story that described his defeat.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very fun game for kids my age. I am ten years old and I really love this game! It's very addicting and u can't stop playing it when u start.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show! The characters are engaging and the story is historically aligned against the backdrop of Britain's involvement in the war.
B007SGM084|4.0|After reading the first book I new there was more to it than what seemed to be.  I was glad I read all three.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Awesome app, but it definitely would be way better if it had been a full feature freeby! :) tht is why I gave a 4 star review on it! I really do enjoy the app and am so glad it works with my screen off! Thanks apalon for being such a gr8 alarm clock to me! Enjoy every one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you know what is going on everything does a 180! I could not put this down even for a second! Although I loved it, I did find the ending a bit dull.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Darius has nailed it again, his soulful ballads promote so many emotions all of us can relate with.<br />5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />Thanks Darius!<br /><br />: )
B0096DZKZC|2.0|Sonic peaked with sonic CD. The only reason generations was so awesome is because it is classic sonic and sonic 3 the 3D edition. Then only games that truly innovated with sonic was the sonic rush series.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|This book would be a delight to anyone who enjoys the television series. Although the character have different names, it isn't difficult to see the television characters' faces as you read. Enjoyable light reading.
B001458MI2|3.0|Unlike most pop stars, Christina Aguilera can actually sing.  Even when the pop star loses her stardom she will always have that strong voice.  Just hope she doesn't lose her mind like Marian Carey!
B000GWE44U|5.0|What can I really say about this movie that hasn't already been said by critics and fans for decades? It is one of the greatest horror/suspense movies of all time. In my opinion, it is the masterpiece of Stanley Kubrick's career and it displays Jack Nicholson in one of his most memorable and defining roles. When you think of classic (yet still frightening by today's standards) horror movies, this is one that will pop into the mind of almost every fan of the genre.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you are starting with a word document and want to convert it to the kindle format this book makes it simple and easy. It covers everything from how to format your word document properly to how to make your chapters interactive in the table of contents. As long as you are doing books that are not image rich, this book explains the entire process and makes it easy to do. I followed the instructios to convert my short-story, Place of Refuge, and post it as a kindle book.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Discovery changed my life.  Alive made we want to end the group.  This one, RAM, is amazing and they're back!  It will not end my obsession with everything Miami Horror, but this is a groovier more funk Discovery + early Jamiroquoi with the audio technology of right now.  So highly recommend this!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would definitely recommend this series, but then again I am into these kinds of shows. The location, actors, all well done.
B005KELW26|5.0|I highly recommend this folio for a Kindle 7 inch.  It fits perfectly, not thick or heavy.  I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B00005JMX6|2.0|This should be called the REALLY CUT VERSION.  This film has absolutely no nudity of the main characters.  The Not Unrated version of this movies is full of it.  How they thought they could call this Unrated and get away with it is beyond me,  Skip this piece of junk and find yorself a copy of the original film.<br /><br />Go read the advisory on IMDB.  See all the stuff they list under Nudity, well none of that is in this movie.  It's only in the original movie.  What an incredible rip off!
B0043D2LAC|5.0|My SLR Camera and Attachments were troubling my Back.  With this System I was able to take all the weight off of my back and support it with my hips.  Note that this is system and you must purchase the Belt with the compartments that you want.  There are choices of Compartments.  The Utility Bag 100 AW held my SLR Camera, Speed Flash and 50 MM lens.  The Lowerpro Lens Case held my Nikon DX 300 Zoom and Extension Tubes. The Speed Flash is a tight fit.
0439023513|1.0|The author committed the unforgivable sin - sacrificing her plot and character consistency for the sake of promoting her agenda. I believe that every author has something they're trying to convey, but it shouldn't turn into a soapbox moment. I am not a Gale fan. Never was. But I do not believe for a moment that the portrayal of his character in this book is consistent with the previous books. And this book was so incredibly boring. It was the Katniss-Peta-Haymitch trilogy that made the first two books as powerful as they were. This book was all Katniss and it suffered terribly for it. I will not be reading anything by this author again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally read this after all the hype died down. This is a great book (I laughed, I cried, I got angry) and the movie didn't do it justice.
0375869026|5.0|I wouldn't have read this book if it hadn't been selected in my children's literature book club. I'm so glad it was! It's been a while since I read a book that made me cry like this one did. Very uplifting and endearing. Some people might not like the tied-with-a-bow ending, but for me, I needed to know that Auggie was going to be okay when I finished the book. It's not always like that in the real world; books are the place where we find hope. This book gave that to me.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app makes it even easier for me to be an Ebayoholic. it's a really easy app to use and I'm glad I found it.
B009R659L8|4.0|I am liking it very much but I have not finished reading it.  Mary Higgins Clark is an excellent writer.  Her characters come alive and the book is hard to put down.  She also has a limited amount of violence which pleases me.  So many mystery writers include a lot of violent scenes in their books.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I laughed so hard I cried! I laughed so hard I annoyed everyone else in the room with me! I'm amazed this is this author's debut book because her writing is so captivating! She claims to be an only child, but I believe she was born and raised in a frat house because she writes from the male point of view so profoundly.
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|As a neuroscientist, this book changed the way I see the brain and inspired me in the path of self-improvement
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|This is a cute app - the cat repeats what you say in a high-pitched voice.  It does a few tricks too.  My grandson liked it a lot.
B004JK61K0|3.0|Did not have the ability to archive to gmail folders, or if it did I could not easily find it
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Highly recommend for everyone in the business of learning and leading!<br />One of many take away points is the definition of Success: Achievements that have a positive impact on others!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love this game. It's alot of fun.  It's a good game for all ages.  I need some more friends.  Please add me.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Based on real life events people don't like to talk about.  But, spins a unique tale of love and hope.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|The story was great. The actors were great! Can't wait to see the next installment in this story. I recommend for everyone to see this fan or not of the books.
B004JKLBUU|5.0|It's small, but my litle one loves it anyway.  Besides, it's easy to take with you on your diaper bag.
0615782043|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It is without a doubt a must read. I can't wait to get some more books by GPA the GREATEST POET ALIVE.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I think this is one of the best Fall Out Boy albums yet. I love all of the collaborations with other artists!!!
B003XE3G0Q|4.0|These are much cuter than the classic crocs style.  The only problem is where the band attaches just to the side of my feet arch it creates a friction point that causes blisters.  Wear them around the house with socks for a few days u til they have loosened up a bit to avoid the blisters.
1451695195|4.0|A must for those who are hard to reach because of there intellect . Over the heads of some  but still thought provoking for anyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|its like temple run except you have a variety of iorn man suits to chose from and they regure stark credits most of the suits cost 7000 or more
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Just set it up very nice display. I am trying the white noise now, sounds relaxing. On to add music, will have to take on the road since it looks better than the hotel clocks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app!!! It is addictive and great competition if you connect it to your Facebook account.My friend introduced it to me and have been playing it nonstop nonviolence I got it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a strange and interesting book about love, heartbreak, friendship and mental illness. I'm so glad I read it before seeing the movie!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book totally surprised me, after book 3, I was convinced there was no way he could match the tension or events, but this book does, evenhandedly.
B00CSJYYO4|5.0|Esun libro interesante th imagination vuela.<br />Lo recomendaria mucho. Me gusto last forma en que relata last leyenda. Estupendo  facinante
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Another great story.  Makes you feel as if you are there with the characters and looking on like a fly on the wall.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Repetitive and boring.  Did the same puzzle over & over. No challenge, short lives. Don,t want to pay extra for items.
B00005JNS0|5.0|.....and cartoons, so I did come to this somewhat biased, and after having wanted to see the movie for years.  Nevertheless it was a total thrill ride (no pun intended) and I enjoyed every second.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I saw the original real story, what a wonderful dog, and for that town in Japan to put up a statue of you.<br />This re-make of that story was as much of a tear jerker as the original.  The acting of, especially that Akita Inu, called Hachi, was beautiful....make sure you have a box of tissue whaen you watch it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|More please! I wanna read this again! I am in aw!! It is new and different and just amazing! and just the opposite  of my idea of love!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This was an amazing story, what imagination went into it.  Also seeing it in 3-D was an experience.  You do not have to go to the theater to see a beautiful 3-D movie, anymore, also.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although, it is fantasy, I see some facts ,all 3 of these books keep you wanting more,It Is The Love Story Of A Life Time!!!
B006H5120E|5.0|I saw the original movie in the theater, it was great then, so  I was very curious to see it at home in 3-D.  Another movie that was remade into 3-D, that was amazing to watch.  I hope there are going to be lots more of the 3-D movies you sell.  We just got this type of TV last Chrristmas, I had my doubts about it then, but no more.  These movies are done so beautifully in 3-D..  I'd advise everyone to have this type of TV, to see the big difference in what a 3-D movie can look like on your home screen, not just in movie theaters, where they can be very expensive to watch, now.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very creative, my new obsession ,will there be more?.......I hope so!!!....never been into romance novels,But this is on fire,I could read this over and over,and I have!!!!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I had my doubts that they could do justice to it in 3-D, but I was wrong.  Some of those flying scenes kept you on the edge of your seat during the movie.  I loved the original movie, and I loved this one too.  Worth seeing.
B005HSL626|5.0|Wow, I really enjoy playing it. I got iPhone version and now I can extend my experience to Kindle Fire.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I grew up with this series and still love it. My Sunday school teacher bought each child in the class one book in the series to introduce us. I love the talking animals and the imagination allowed to be expressed when c.s.Lewis writes for children that I do not see as well expressed in his adult science fiction books.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|This is so amazing you can get almost anything you want on here. The only bad part is that on survival you have to have blocks in your inventory to edit it also you cant edit on creative. Also get APTOID and download ultimate tool kit ( off the Internet)
B007EC27QM|5.0|This a a really great thing to have on your kindle. It is easy to use, large numbers which are easy to read and so convenient. Really love it and glad I added the app. I use it all the time when balancing my checkbook and at other times as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is the best game ever .It is really fun! If I were you I would get this game
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|As always, I enjoy the sweet sounds of Andrea.  A must have for those who appreciate good, no great music.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I HAD TO BUY THE SECOND BOOK IMMEDIATELY!  I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET THE SECOND ONE DOWNLOADED AND GET IT STARTED!
B00AK77WPE|5.0|This concert was outstanding! I attended this concert and the rain didn't stop for one second, but the crowds energy was too big to let the water ruin it for us. RECOMMEND IT 100%!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I COULD NOT PUT MY KINDLE DOWN! ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! I HAVE NOT READ A BETTER BOOK IN A LONG TIME!
0812983459|5.0|This one is something different. I do not want to spoil the plot, but this is a pilgrimage both physically, as in a long trip, and a pilgrimage of the re-connection between husband and wife. It is well-written and the back story of Harold's life emerges as he walks. Read this! It is not getting nearly the attention it deserves.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I HAVE JUST STARTED THE THIRD BOOK AND SO FAR IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO! I SURE HOPE I AM NOT LET DOWN BY THE ENDING....  GREAT WORK!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't understand what all the buzz was about.  I was gifted the kindle version of this book.  I enjoyed it, to be sure.  I found it well written and the characters were well developed.  There was nothing that really exciting here; nothing that made me say \\"Wow!\\" and it certainly didn't make me want to rush back to Amazon to buy the next two books in the trilogy.  It was a fine read but that was it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very fun game to pass the time!!!<br />Love playing this game when I am bored keeps the brain working.<br />Don't feel so unproductive when times are slow.<br />Oh my gosh why do the give you a 20 word minimum for these reviews that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard if !!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is tons of fun. The potions are very useful but some have side effects that can halt game progress.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Sadly I have yet to get this feature to work for me yet . The instructions did not make it clear to me on how you set up this feature so I have yet to use it.. booooo
B000FC11A6|4.0|Excellent book.  Some of the math was over my head but didn't detract from the book.  Ends kind of abruptly but not in a bad way.  Highly recommended to any World War Two buff or mathematician.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I'm so glad my daughter turned me onto this series. It is smart, sexy, and addicting! Don't miss it! Holmes and Watson are both brilliant characters and played brilliantly.
B002KKCVR8|5.0|...without Tevas. Great amazing sandal , perfect fit , comfy cushioning.<br />i ll wear them for everything, even with Chinos and a button down shirt, for gardening and for light to medium mountain hikes.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I'm jumping on the Tangled bandwagon!  I've read several books in a row that I've really enjoyed (yay!  I'm on a roll!), but this is probably my favorite and definitely the most original.  The author really has done a great job in presenting the male POV.  The H sounds and acts like a total guy!  What's amazing is that the H is NOT my favorite type of protagonist;  I do not admire the man-wh0r.es that have become so popular.  But the author's style of writing from the H's POV - and making it  humorous, addressing the audience, and self-aware - make it work.  And I love his actions - so romantic, yet still so him!<br /><br /> This book really worked as a light-hearted, funny (without being slapstick), feel-good, romantic read.  I couldn't put it down.
B00124BNF4|5.0|A great mix of their best. All songs were ones we all remember. Received promptly and in good condition. I recommend
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is a typical Grisham story. Characters of all types that anyone can relate to with a believable plot yet twists to keep it exciting. It started a little slow but turned out as good as the rest!!
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|Both wife and I fell asleep during this movie. We were looking forward to seeing this but we were so disappointed
B000UZNSWM|4.0|This is a great book that goes beyond the war itself. It concentrates on the personalities involved on all sides. It really increased my understanding of the Korean War.<br /><br />However, the Kindle version is seriously flawed. I enjoy maps- they help me visualize the action and the battle. In the kindle version, the maps are small. When I enlarge them to full size (on my 10 inch screen) they are so blurry that they are impossible to comprehend. Every map is this way.<br /><br />So, do not buy the Kindle version. Buy only a printed version if you care at all about viewing the maps.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Help me I can't put the book down its toooooooo amazingly awesomely superbly excitingly excruciatingly awesome book I love hunger games
B00AZQ4VMC|1.0|As a huge Roxy and Ferry fan I thought this idea could really work. Musically, most of the songs do work but the sound is so bad that the end result is unlistenable. Hopefully, Ferry will see the error of his ways and re-release this in high fidelity sound. This is the worst sounding recording of all time, and that is really saying something.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It wasn't as great a book as several other Mitch Albom books I have read.  this one was not my favorite, but still a good book.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Just as described, quickly shipped.  Would buy from again, happy customer
0307477479|2.0|The one thing, it seems to me, about penning a multiple character novel is to not only make them interesting but to weave them into the plot to where it makes sense and ultimately serves a function in the outcome. This work by Jennifer Egan fails miserably on all accounts. It does have multiple characters, but by page 100, I'd challenge that the reader not only cannot keep track of them anymore, he doesn't care about them either. Burden on the reader never seemed to be a concern here and as a result, this book suffers mightily for it.<br /><br />The story seems loosely arranged around an aging record producer who once played bass guitar in a punk band and his now disaffected secretary/assistant. Neither of these warrant a connection with the reader and then we're soon inundated with peripheral characters that have even less charm. The writing is, at best, pedestrian while chapter after chapter go off on meaningless tangents...we see one former band member, now obese, planning a \\"Suicide Tour\\", but this just tails off. Another arcane segment deals with one character's older married man lover suddenly in Africa on some irrelevant trip with his children. Never do these or a host of other lines of story come to any conclusion...again I believe the author attempts to carry the narrative with flowing writing and character depth. A colossal failure.<br /><br />The most mind boggling feature about this work is that it won the Pulitzer Prize! I searched and searched for depth and meaning here but found just drivel. I will give kudos to Egan for attempting something groundbreaking, though, with a chapter laid out as a Power Point presentation but even that gets quickly overwhelming. Reminding me of the pages long rant at the end of another highly overrated novel, Atlas Shrugged (by Ayn Rand) in terms of tediousness, this is not only quickly ineffective, but exceedingly laborious to read and comprehend. Again no consideration to reader burden.<br /><br />Certainly tastes makebooks and evidently many enjoyed this work but this reviewer was very disappointed and shocked at the notion that this could even be nominated for the lofty Pulitzer, let alone win it. If I had to do it over again, I would definitely pass.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Star trek and Star is Born was unable to rate because we could not watch it. The quality was poor and film kept stopping. We were able to view the other 2 with no problem
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Requires NO additional permissions.<br /><br />SOLD!<br /><br />Also, it's pretty fun and easy to set down and pick back up again.<br /><br />The graphics make the matching game a bit hard, but I'm used to shiny diamonds and those type matching games so it may become easier with time.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Well written. Dark and urgent. Mothers and daughters, friends and lovers. Twists and turns. Murder and mayhem. All this and more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played it on my friends ipad but I want know if this has wolves and horses in this version please someone tell me.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Joshua Foer is doing what he should be doing, that is, writing.  His explainations throughout the book show his finesse and detail in giving the reader understanding of difficult situations to explain.  Aside from liking the title with its magnetic imagery, Foer's boldness and adventuring covering two continents to complete the story is unique.  I'd expected much more of an explaination of various procedures used in remembering.  In this I was disappointed, however, the journey Foer took is well worth reading, thus I give it four and not five stars.
B0085KGHI6|4.0|Very good blues because of Muddy Waters.  The Stones are present but not a large part of the show.  CD makes for good car music if you're into blues.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Answered some questions and gave me more questions to be answered (once I get to heaven)!  I disliked the technical chapter toward the end of the book ... probably because I am not a medical person but if I were one, I probably would have been greatly interested in what Dr. Alexander had to say, medicaly.  I would recommend this to anyone especially skeptics in the medical arenas.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Interesting plot, started a lil slow but jumped right into action. Ending was not expected, plenty of starts in the movie
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Not a great movie. Too fake with the special effects. I don't feel like it did the book justice at all.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Didn't think it was going to be to good, the commercials didnt do it any justice but I guess they saved the good parts for the movie
B0063M22QO|5.0|Lots of fun with various degrees of difficulty.  Good graphics easy to see  and play.  Try it to experience it for yourself.fT
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play a lot and there are a lot of glitches with error messages that you have a poor connection when in fact that is not the case, it is a program error.
B0024FADDI|5.0|This is a great horror comedy. I loved it! Such a classic!! Bruce Campbell makes this movie. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes classic horror.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|We love this movie. It is clean and fun and entertaining. I would recommend this to other families. It was delivered quickly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books get better and better. This book was the best book of the trilogy. I wish there was a book four letting us know more
B004XMMSZG|1.0|Didn't work with neither one of my iHome sound docks. Didn't work in my Honda Odyssey - primary place where I wanted to use it. So I returned it. Phone pairs OK with it, but sound just doesn't come through.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Having already played this through on the PC, I'm pleased to see it offered as a FAOTD.<br /><br />The gameplay is very similar to Puzzle Quest in that you play a matching game to gain power, attack enemies and use magic. However, the ability to add&nbsp;and mix enhancements to your skills adds a strategic element to it.<br /><br />Just as fun to play in short stretches as it is for extended periods of time.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Fast pace. Exciting. Another great Sigma Force story.  I can't wait for the next one.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes special operations stories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My family and l love this game. Very addictive, be prepared to lose track of time. Great game for building hand and eye co-ordination.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|This is a really exciting piece of military literature!  If you're looking for a perfect piece of can't-put-it-down airport fiction, then definitely read \\"The Ian Fleming Files:  Operation Armada.\\"  The pristine visuals, the thoroughly researched technology and people and places, the easy one-liners, and the action-adventure tone make it feel like -- you guessed it -- a great James Bond movie.  Which is no surprise, considering Ian Fleming based his James Bond character on his own exploits with Naval Intelligence.  The best part is, reading this, you can't help but wonder whether it's fact or fiction.  I kept running off to Wikipedia to research little details that cropped up here and there in the story.<br /><br />If you're a fan of James Bond and the novels of Clive Cussler, you will read this book in one sitting!
B003KRLKHC|5.0|This movie was brilliant! One of the best post-apocalyptic movies that I've watched more than once. I don't want to go into too much, but the ending was mind-blowing for me!
B0037AGASG|5.0|Well Justin Bieber did it again with his music and voice on this CD and better then the other I bought, though both My Worlds are great. His voice is more pronounced and stronger with smoothness vocally and the band is very good. Just a fraction even with Justin when the voice should be heard over the musicians instruments. Still I will give this CD a 5 star. I really liked it and old as I am, hay not that old, it's good to dance to for the young and for me too.<br />  I think this was one of Justin's best and now I can't wait to hear his acoustic CD I bought. Let you know how I feel about it when it comes soon, I hope. (JV)
B003QSIM30|4.0|Typical Disney princess movie! Be cautious if you have little eyes watching. My little one was no too keen on the Voodoo sequences.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|It was a good movie but it was more about the passage of the 13th amendment than President Lincoln himself.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I really like the direction Christian Bale is taking the series. It's a very dark story, not the bubblegum Batman most grew up with. Sad to see Heath pass on after the Dark Knight, because I think the storyline could have evolved into something phenomenal.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have to say, while I am not uber-satisfied at the way the series ended, I am not nearly as negative about this book as some of the other reviewers are. I actually am less frustrated than I expected to be. Yes, the earlier Sookie books were much better, but this one was an enjoyable read as well. Perhaps some plot lines were wrapped up too neatly, while others didn't seem to fit with the characters, but the more I read, the more &#34;okay&#34; I was with that.<br /><br />War & Peace it is not, but it still made for fun poolside reading. I will miss Sookie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is definitely up there in my top 5 favourite books for 2013.<br /><br />Hilarious read that had me laughing out loud so many times, which is hard to do when your husband is asleep beside you in bed and you are reading in the dark on a kindle until 1.00am.<br /><br />I loved this couple, it was so refreshing because you just never knew what was going to come out of Drew's mouth and then the inside of his mind was freaking awesome :)  Like this:<br /><br />&#34;A guy would take a cheese grater to his tongue before admitting he screwed up&#34; - Drew<br /><br />And the passion between them is so smexy hot but when they argue it is so funny:<br /><br />&#34;You are driving me crazy!&#34;, I raise my eyebrows hopefully.  &#34;Crazy?  Like you want to rip my shirt open again?&#34;  &#34;No.  Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that just won't go away.&#34;<br /><br />The one liners from Drew are legendary and I love that this whole book has been written from his perspective, giving us an insight into his mind.<br /><br />Did I mention that they are steaming hot in the bedroom, oh I did :)<br /><br />I really loved this book, not too heavy/angsty and so refreshing to read<br /><br />Five stars *****
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not much of a gamer, so don't pretend to be an expert on these games.  It was okay as games go.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|They did an excellent job on the blu-ray version.  The quality is great, sound it great, and of course the movie is great.  This was one of my favorite movies to watch as a kid, so I love having now that I'm older.
1401233791|5.0|I bought this after seeing the dark knight rises. Wanting to learn more about bane i bought this book to see his origins. It was very entertaining and well written
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Great Movie.<br />I actually use this movie in my classroom to give students the definition of a Vector! It really is a very original movie that is extremely entertaining.  It's a movie that I can watch multiple times and not get sick of it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I had pre-ordered this movie and waited anxiously for it to arrive.  Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field, along with other greats like Hal Holbrook and Tommy Lee Jones make this a must have for any historical movie buff.  Stephen Spielberg did an excellent job, and I loved the humorous Lincoln sayings.  It was both entertaining and informative.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|I'm a big HP fan, so I love this movie.  I thought they did a great job putting the Deathly Hallows book into a movie.  One of my favortie movies of the entire series.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Saw it at the theater first, loved it so much I had to buy it. Just a great performance and story spin.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|I loved the broadway musical and I thought that this movie rendition was done well.  I think that Meryl Streep was a lot of fun to watch.  This is a movie that I can put in when I'm working on other things because it doesn't require my full attention to follow.  Sometimes those movies are the best to keep around.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Bradley Cooper was excellent in his portrayal of a mixed-up man trying to get his act together after some serious setbacks in his life.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I love this movie, it's very entertaining for both adults and children.  It has a lot of re-watching potential, which is very good considering most kids will want to re-watch it many times.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Isn't this going to be released in 3D like in the theaters?? So far I haven't been able to find it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was based on a true event which lends more credibility to the story. The movie was blended through and through with video snipits from the actual events as recorded at the time it happened.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|pretty fun game. glad to see that the game is going back to the dungeon crawler. Just started the game and I already cant put it down.
1439102813|5.0|Good book, I work with Alzheimer patients.. I find it very rewarding,, interesting book..I would recommend it, to family that has a loved one with dementia or alzheimers
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was great and I fell in love with the characters. It just seemed like they never could of get enough sex.
1416583432|4.0|well written, a lot of research sounds like the author put into this book,,I would recommend it to dog lovers
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I'm a big fan of match 3 games. This one is especially good. Some of the game levels are quite challenging but the best part is watching the little people build the buildings.
B009369Z8A|4.0|I saw this movie at the theater and enjoyed it a lot. I decided to add it to my collection because my wife liked it also and she was quite surprised when it arrived as she didn't know i ordered it. Quite good..to me and the wife at least.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie again.  Tom Cruise was excellent in this movie.  Also, it had a good story.  Good way to spend a couple of hours.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I really hope this doesn't get canceled! Mads Mikkelsen portrays a lovely Hannibal and I really enjoy Hugh Dancy's character as well. It's a great show.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|She's deaf and some of her friends can't read so hoping it will make her communication better since she pushes button and it speaks what she has typed.
0800177975|5.0|This movie was sent to our son when he was out of the country and it gave many hour of enjoyment while he was away.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is full of great ideas for everyone and most occasions. I need something like this because I don't have the best imagination when it comes to decorating or creating things.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Watching this series all over again brings back good memories. Must See TV! One of the best cop shows ever.
034580404X|5.0|The others at work were reading them and I love to read so gave them a try.<br />They held my interest all the way.  Did not like Mr. Grey but that made the book even better.<br />My sister and both daughter-in-laws have read the books and enjoyed them very much.<br />I bought the books for my girl friend to read because I did not want to loan my books.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|great read, not too long. definitely kept me interested throughout the story.  she's an awesome writer overall. I really enjoy reading her books
B0018QQQK8|5.0|A great read, for all ages from 13 to 130. It really gives you a new outlook upon life. I definitely recommend it!
078322933X|1.0|I received my copy recently and it is not compatible with DVD player here in Australia. After viewing many sites that clearly stated their DVDs would not work here in oz, I found one at amazon that not only shipped DVDs here but made no mention that it may not work. I have bought many items through amazon and this is my first negative experience
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Pretty good book. I cannot write a good book review.just say i liked it and couldn,t put down. Thank you
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|So So.  Didn't seem to have a very high production value.  Story line was good, acting was decent, but sets, props and such ruined it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an awesome game  but way too short. Dunno if it was worth the money to buy it, but it was fun! I hope the creators make more, but with more levels next<br />time. Thanks either way though!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|About 3/4 through.  Not as interesting as I had hoped.  Read on the recommendation of a friend. Might refer to a friend.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Absolutely addictive and fun. I like the way it made and drawings. Also a good challenge as well. Recommended to try for everyone
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I've downloaded the app, and no matter how many times I try, the android version will not accept my kindle login and password. So I'll be deleting the app, and looking for alternatives.
B008OOYALE|4.0|My children & I enjoy this game very much. The only reasons I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's hard to invite people to be neighbors & it costs so many coins to complete quests that they build up on you.
B008P9M614|5.0|I was not a big House fan when it originally aired, likely another show captured my attention, but I had seen a few episodes. After watching the first episode I was hooked. It was alarmingly edgy and risqué...Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) never ceases to surprise me by what he says and does some positive and some negative, but nonetheless captivating, shocking, and entertaining. I highly recommend this series, but it is not for the weak and politically correct at heart. My adult children can't wait to visit to catch an episode or two as their college schedule allows and we dissect the episode for hours. Greatly entertaining and provocative.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Very well done as are her other books.  Reads as easy as a novel with plenty of facts.  On the top of my recommended list
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Updated my review! Now that I know how to delete the no-shows, that is, the players that only do a game or two..... Swipe over their name, then X the delete prompt! You'll always find another random player, ready to play! Of course, you will find some players to be anxious to continue playing. More addicting than I can stand, though! It helps if you're a good artist or like drawing. I usually have 5-10 plays to catch up with every morning.Love it!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief played beautifully with Greek mythology.  My family and I were greatly entertained.  The movie included light teen boy/girl relationship dynamics, but it was tame enough for my pre-teen.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|A fantastic and compelling story that merges history with science fiction and love. This was one of the best stories I've read in a while.
B008K8U13K|2.0|I do not like this game in America. this games will die to death. it will go to the gods.  its pour
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|On time and love to watch some movies that seem to dissappear in time . and good blue ray is great - Kudos
1439153663|5.0|Outstanding book that should be read in schools for a better idea of how women and African Americans were treated.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simply awesome.  Without a doubt its best season thus far.  Every single episode kept me on the edge of my seat.
0062014102|2.0|I purchased this book recently after a rekindling of interest in reality theories.  Sometime last year I became enthralled with reality and consciousness after a friend introduced me to the oddities of physical material at the quantum level.  I've been reading books since then that seek to find a connect between the knowable scientific and material world and the spiritual or abstract dimensions of consciousness or the \\"universe\\" so to speak.<br /><br />What I was looking for, and what I'm afraid many people may also be looking for when reading the subtitle \\"A revolutionary theory of reality that explains the latest frontiers of physics,...\\" etc. was an actual plausible theory and concrete explanation of Talbot's holographic theory, backed by some degree of scientific inquiry, or barring that, a theory backed by logical observation.<br /><br />What I got was a book that is 75 pages of moderately interesting descriptions of Talbot's vision of the Holographic \\"theory\\" with a solid few pages of concrete science followed by 225 pages of the most absolutely useless anecdotal and incidental support for it that could possibly have ever been amassed.  Faith healers, disappearing acts, acid trips, stigmata, and even Talbot's own self proclaimed ability to move objects with his enormous brain are all touted as \\"factual evidence\\" of the existence of the holographic model chapter after increasingly irrelevant chapter.  There is scarcely a drop of hard scientific information provided in the entire book, and Talbot rarely makes time to analyze one of his witch-doctor voodoo references for validity before immediately confirming it as concrete proof of his holographic universe.<br /><br />The book proposed an interesting idea that I am sincerely interested in furthering, failed to fully develop the idea into anything plausible, and never even approached the integration of science into the \\"theory\\".  If you're into tarot cards and palm reading and religions experiences brought on byhallucinogenic drugs then this really will be an entertaining book.  But if you're curious about the plausibility of different reality theories scientifically, or looking for any sort of large scale validity whatsoever in an alternate theory of consciousness and reality, save your money.  You won't find it in this book.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|This is possibly the greatest show in existence. Very tense, but also funny. The fact that there are two hot guys helps.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the rope, is one of those games that can span generations. Kids and adults both love it because om nom is adorable and gameplay can be challenging. Lots of levels, cute cartoons, well worth 99&cent;!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This one of the best mobile minecraft games i have ever played amazing i just would wish if the updates would be faster and add mods and texture packs also i would like if u add diffrent armor and buckets. Thank u :)
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|If the music from Star Trek [2009] was any indication, Michael Giacchino was set to deliver once again. When I started listening to the score, not only did he deliver, but the expectation was completely shattered. From the opening titles, to the end credits, each song conveyed emotion, action, suspense, and drama. This is not only a Star Trek score, but just awesome music all around.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was an excellent read. It did not take long to read the and was a real page turner. I would highly recommend this book.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Normal comic book movie. Enjoyed it! Wanted to see it before I saw Iron Man 3. So if you like comic book movies, you will like this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I just surfed the store for some cool battery app,and as I remember,that was the first to pop up. Downloaded,and had no regret ever since. Beautiful,informative,trustworthy,5 stars are the only logical choice here.

0307743659|5.0|The Shining is a 1977 horror novel by Stephen King. It is about a man named Jack who goes to an isolated hotel with his wife and son so he can write a novel and not get writer's block. His son Danny has a strange power and he speaks to a spirit of some sort. When they get to the hotel, Jack slowly starts going crazy as the hotel is haunted with evil spirits that are manipulating him into doing harmful things. I love both the novel and the Stanley Kubrick film, but I want to mention the differences between the two.<br /><br />Differences between the novel and the 1980 Stanley Kubrick film:<br /><br />1. The novel shows many scenes where the characters are talking in their heads.<br /><br />2. The haunted room is called room 217 in the novel, and room 237 in the film.<br /><br />3. In the novel, both of Danny's parents know about his telepathic powers.<br /><br />4. The novel is much more violent than the film. The baseball bat scene is much more gruesome. In the novel, Jack breaks Wendy's ribs with the bat, then she smashes an object on his head, knocking him out.<br /><br />5. In the novel, we get a scene where Danny sees Tony in person and is speaking to him.<br /><br />6. The film doesn't adapt any of the parts with the guy in the bondage dog costume. Including the creepy scene where the guy is covered in blood tells Danny he's gonna eat him. We do see him in one scene though where he is doing something suggestive with his master.<br /><br />7. In the film, Hallorann is killed with an axe, but in the novel, Hallorann doesn't die.<br /><br />8. The ending of the film is completely different from the ending of the novel. At the end of the novel, the hotel explodes while Jack is inside. Wendy, Danny, and Hallorann escape alive.<br /><br />So I just wanted to mention those differences. Both the novel and film are terrific.<br /><br />All in all, Stephen King's The Shining is a really good and classic horror novel that horror fans should read.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great story. I read the book several years ago and had forgotten how engaging, imaginative and touching the story is. The movie does justice to the story. And the cinematography is absolutely stunning.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out in theaters. I own it on DVD. The 3D Blueray just takes it to a whole new level. They did a wonderful conversion on this film. Breathtaking!
B004N6369Y|1.0|This is an awful book and I should have know better than to order it.Thought it was about a place I know in Paris.MWD
B00AB0Z88S|2.0|I was so disapointed. Every time a character moved or anything else for that matter it blured badly. I had the same problem with Ice Age Continental Drift and Darkest Hour. I have a LG Cinema style 3D tv with an LG 3D blueray player. I have a top dollar high speed HDMI cable running between the two. I don't have this problem with the dozens of other 3D movies I own and no problems with my DirecTV 3D programing either. Does anyone else have this problem? I can't be the only one.
0385360185|5.0|Great book, I really enjoyed listening to there entire trilogy of Fifty Shades, can't wait until E.L, James writes another.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My 3 year old wanted this since its a nemo game however its definitely meant for older kids. She still likes it however she doesn't really understand it.
1592332803|5.0|I have wowed coworkers numerous times with these great recipes! I love that when I show them the recipe, it's all NORMAL stuff that you have in your kitchen, nothing scary about vegan baking! I've shared the book with family members and a coworker whose child has an egg allergy. I love the little boxes of useful information on each page, and the introduction is thorough and thoughtful. Colleen is a great advocate for \\"vegan\\" food (it's REAL food, people!) and I'm glad she is around.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For those who've been addicted to games like those in the Myst franchise, I think you'll find this favorably comparable. What I find most enjoyable is the fact that sometimes three dimensional thinking AND viewing is required to find the solution. And at time it feels like how I'm holding my tongue makes a difference.
6305558167|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Saw it when it was new, in the theaters, and never get tired of it. Nicol Williamson steals the show as Merlin, followed closely by the heavy dramatic musical score, mostly Wagner. Gorgeous scenery, even spectacular. One of the few things you need to overlook is that knights of the era would not have had full body plate armor  - that is Medieval/Renaissance era, not immediate post-Roman. I've seen this described as surrealistic, I suppose it is, especially some of the later scenes. Very powerful imagery and some deep symbolism too, I think.<br /><br />A number of familiar faces! Patrick Stewart as one of the knights, Liam Neeson, and Clive Swift (Richard Bucket, pronounced &#34;Bouquet,&#34; from &#34;Keeping Up Appearances&#34;), as Sir Ector, young Arthur's foster father. Helen Mirren as Morgana. The unspeakably gorgeous Cheryl Lunghi as Guinivere.<br /><br />As I say, just epic. A must for any fan of legend, folklore, sword n sorcery, semi-historical epics. Oh btw, the picture on the DVD cover, at least the one I got and the one I see next to this, has NOTHING to d with this movie, but it's a nice picture.<br /><br />An&aacute;l nathrach,<br />orth’ bh&aacute;is’s bethad,<br />do ch&eacute;l d&eacute;nmha
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have made it to round 153 really simple yet hours of fun. I recommend it.WARNING HARD AT FIRST UNLOCK MORE MONKEYS. Only took two days for me to hit 153 but it moves along slowly once at round 87.
B009E3EY38|1.0|I just gave this as a gift last week and the person I gave it to says two of the disks don't work ,I would like an exchange for a set that works
B00AR83PN4|5.0|I love, love, love this highly addictive game!! Just hard enough to be challenging, but easy enough not to frustrate you. You will love it!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I now know why I read so little fiction and stick mainly to non-fiction.<br />Long, drawn out and goes no where for the first half of the book.  The ending is completely ridiculous and I'm surprised she found someone to publish this book with such a poor culmination of this story. Some parts were cleverly thought out and I will give the author her dues for that, but on the whole it was a waste of my time and money!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Simply said this is a keeper. I like the story and when I have a day ( maybe a blizzard) I'll pull this out and kill the time. This is not the kind of thing you watch just one.
B009NPK1IO|4.0|The acting is good, backdrop in NY City is always super. Only distraction is soundtrack, which is sometimes almost inaudible.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My granddaughter loves this. We got this as a Christmas gift and it did the trick. She plays this over and over again (she's 2). So we are getting use to the songs and watching her in front of the TV.<br /><br />If you get this, be ready to sing along.
0525953590|5.0|I love this book. It is a constant learning experience which is presented in an understandable and often humorous way. I now feel like I have a basic understanding of particle physics that will stick for a long time and want to learn more. Thank you Sean Carroll for writing such an engaging book.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Predictable, but good acting, and entertainment. Satire on who really has mental issues. Is it you or all the &#34;normal&#34; people around you.
B000002JKA|4.0|I am a fan of the Dream Theater. However, this is not their best album. Still, these guys throw down.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really like this game. I think that it is very entertaining. The only problem is that it is very challenging for little kids.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Of course,  there is a generic similarity to innumerable other space odysseys, but, nonetheless, this is likely to be an entertaining interlude for the average viewer, whether or not addicted to this kind of science fiction. Director and actors, with considerable help from the technical designers, make this voyage with the last  earth-people in existence, just that extra bit different to save it from the junk yard into which so many have fallen. No exciting shots of man in the universe, no dazzling displays of modern electronic eye-candy, just people within what is best described as the inside of a modern skyscraper's basement. Lots of fighting with, somehow, a Vietnamese warrior to enliven the proceedings. I suppose someone on the creative crew or among the producers was a Vietnam era draft-age protester.<br />It is a decent although not WOW movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the app read it every morning.. easy to read and navigate thru it can jump from verse to chapter quickly
B00338QENI|5.0|The book is a very enlightening about how little control we all have over the use of our genes that are mined from voluntary participation in medical experiments, or removed as part of routine hospital procedures.  It makes me think twice about &#34;donating&#34; to medical research.  I don't think we have come very far in notifying volunteers or explaining to patients of how their physical specimens may be used, since the example in this book originated in the early 50s. I saw the family in Seattle and believe they have handled this situation with dignity, despite their shabby treatment from all the institutions involved. I hope they receive some benefit from the book by acknowledging the tremendous advancement of science that their family made possible under very difficult circumstances.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game when I just need a down time relaxing game at the end of a busy day.
B0006TSSNG|5.0|Has to be one of the best WWII series ever done.  Factual, shows the good, bad, and the ugly.  Put a human face on the evil called war.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful presentation. Easily the best puzzle app offered for the Kindle. Ends too soon. I look forward to an encore.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  The stories of each of the characters are so engaging.  Though I came to dislike the author when he started killing off my favorite characters.  I should have expected that after the first two, but I was not ready to lose them.  I am looking forward to the second half of this and to the next book after that.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is really great. it is just like the Littlest  Pet Shop game i have. it is very fun but i get shut off it sometimes.i would like if you could fix that but besides that it is a great game
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|The writing was terrible ., seemed like this movie was made for severly uneducated people . I would not recoommend this
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew Evans is deliciously entertaining, impossible to resist, outrageously hilarious, and you simply can't get enough. In fact, I'm feeling a touch of the flu coming on & the only cure is more Drew. Tangled more than earns a brilliant, out-of-this-world hysterical, swoon-worthy five stars. Emma Chase has written a highly recommended story with unforgettable characters that are absolutely beyond comparison, and I cannot wait to get my hands on more of her work.<br /><br />Tangled was, by far, one of the best books I've EVER read. This is one of those books that is so amazingly good, that you can't even begin to write a review that does it justice. I just want to shout from the rooftops, READ THIS BOOK NOW, WORLD! Drew Evans is a character that will not be forgotten-ever. He's a cocky man who you simply can't help but fall for. He's sexy, charming, and downright hilarious. He tells it like it is, no holds bar. Emma Chase does an amazing job taking us into the mind of Drew Evans as he determines to make Kate his. I don't believe I've ever read a better perspective from the male POV.<br /><br />Kate was an equally charming character, fierce and feisty, while keeping Drew on his toes. She's the female character you look for in every book. Strong, confident, and ambitious, she definitely enjoys giving Drew a run for his money. I want to be her when I grow up.<br /><br />I loved their early love/hate relationship, and their playful banter had a smile on my face. Their chemistry practically radiates off of them with every encounter; you have no idea when the combustion is going to occur. Because it's going to...it's only a matter of time.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|this game is fun and enjoy the music and pretty colors. Having to purchase items is a bummer fun for a free game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very ingenious! This is not a run of the mill game and requires quite creative thinking. I look forward to the next game.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I put off seeing this movie because of the mediocre reviews when it came out.  I'm sorry I waited.  I really enjoyed watching it.  The story line was compelling and I liked that they used the names of a couple of real police figures (Parker, & Gates) to infuse some sense of reality and relevance into the story line (well, if you are a native Angelino as I am then it provides the relevance).<br /><br />The police characters are interesting and it played better for me than the Kevin Costner Untouchables movie, although, the present movie borrowed liberally from Costner's.<br /><br />There is blood and gore in this movie, so the squeamish should be warned.  But, it wasn't as vile as better known mafia movies or HBO.  Emma Stone performed her role very convincingly and Brolin was surprisingly well suited for this movie too.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|For us, the movie was a complete waste of money.  We had high hopes with Tom Hanks being one of the listed actors.  However, from the very beginning it was apparent that it was created for a very liberal audience.  Personally, we had no interest in subjecting ourselves to homosexual behaviors.  If you are a Christian or have conservative values, I do not recommend this movie.  Thanks but No Thanks!!!
B00000ITOY|5.0|Great educational toy that will hold up for years to come...Teaches shapes and colors. Many toys have each shape in a different color. This has all 4 colors in all 4 shapes. You could teach a color at a time.
B008R6MI8G|4.0|loved the video but, would have liked the picture to be brighter but realize it had to do with  the story line.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Action. Detail. I love it it's my favorite series. Since I finished this book, I've read the whole series. I hope you other readers out there love it
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Not as much happens in this book as in book 1.  Stuff does happen, but it all feels like a prelude to something bigger.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this on a whim. Loved it. Can't wait to finish the series. Won't see the movie until I've read all the books.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|Part one is a slog, but once you get through it, that's when things really start to get moving.  I couldn't stop when I began part two.  Well worth the effort!
B00C061I3K|1.0|Daft Punk is my favorite band. I was so exited when I heard a new album was coming out. I love the powerful punch they deliver physically and to the emotions. Well, it isn't here. It is slow, sounds like disco, eighties, lot of talking, rambling. I don't care about your personal life, not when I am paying for music. Wonder if this is music they put together decades ago and think someone want to hear this junk now. Last tune was ok. Guess I paid 10 bucks for one tune.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|I have only recently discovered Jo Nesbo, and have found the 3 books I have read so far excellent. Harry Hole as the central character gradually grows on you.  The plot was exciting, the charactarers fascinating, and suspense till the end.  I also found it refreshing not having the story in the US.
B000IOM0WO|5.0|My husband had this on vhs and I wanted to get it for him if it was on Blu ray and was surprised to find it.  My husband was really thrilled about getting this U2 Rattle & Hum Blu-ray.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love Love Love it.  Got one for my niece who is also a Buble fan and we both felt it was one of his best.
B0095P31L6|3.0|It started off great, but lost a bit of momentum when they took off after the thieves.  Plus, you could tell the bad guy almost immediately.  Love the snake's Gatlin gun tail, though.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|You will really enjoy this movie. The story line is so reallistic for that time in history. You will laugh your head off. So buy it and sit down for an evening of fun .  David
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great little free calculator app. Ads aren't intrusive to the functionality either.  Invaluable tool to have when you need it.
B0086900TI|5.0|This movie speaks to the condition of many people today. Victims of a wounded childhood; just wanting to fit in; to be seen; to be heard; to be loved and accepted for who they are. Either acting out to get attention or shuting down to block the pain that we are seldom ever able to put into words; haunted by our past. I truly enjoyed this movie. Adrien Brody always make his character so real, more than just a role that he is playing. I was surprised by all the other well known actors that are also in this movie.
B00BLGZDYA|5.0|this movie is completely surprising, mystifying, and beautiful at almost every turn.  if you're looking for something easy to digest it's not at all for you, but it will stick with you for days afterward.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|So many nongamers here who have no idea what they are talking about. It has progression and dungeon crawling, that makes it an RPG. Yes retro graphics is overplayed but if you ignore the fantastic gameplay because of that I don't know why you are leaving a one-star review for a GAME.<br /><br />As to why this is worth 5 stars (at least) let me just say that I owned this on the PC and was SHOCKED to see it be the FAOTD because it is such a quality, immersive and fun title (unlike 95% of the stuff that pops up as FAOTD). I have heard it was much better on touch devices than on the PC and now I can confirm that it is! Thanks for a good app for once, Amazon.
B008J34466|5.0|p!nk is amazing i love this cd, got it as a gift. it came on time; glad i ordered it here
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I found the story interesting and sometimes fast moving but it comes up a little short of the authors usual writings.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|i love this movie so much - it is my childhood. it came on time am very glad i ordered it
B00338QENI|5.0|I found it shocking, educational and entertaining. Easy to keep up with it when it moved back and forth. Easy read. Hard to put down. Made me angry at times, laugh at times and over all an eye opener
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|My granddaughter told me she didn't want to see this movie but went with some friends and this was the movie everyone else wanted to see.  She said she actually loved it and that it was really good, and encouraged me to see it.  It was on the list of video streams and I thought it was time I took a look.  It was good and I recommend it highly as super hero fun with a proud USA theme.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Good story. Had some unexpected turns.  The characters felt life like while reading.<br />Author has a good way of describing thoughts
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book has become one of my favorite novels ever. It is absolutely beautiful and I could read it again and again. Lauren Oliver is a fantastic writer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot stop watching these shows to get to the final one! Edge of my seat! Totatlly addicted to it!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I think what I enjoyed most about this book were it's characters and how real they seemed. It was also laugh out loud funny at times which helped out with the underlying sadness to their lives. Overall, a great book.
B0094KT8W8|5.0|Loved this movie. Didn't think it would be much as we never got into the original but this one is great. No language and the violence aspect, although present, is more of an animation with them breaking like ice or something to that effect. Loved the musical score as well. I'm a bad critic as I just love most movies, so add this one to my loved list.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I know there is much controversy surrounding the ending of this book/trilogy but I thought it was PERFECT. I think it's illogical to assume that Lauren Oliver would have given full closure to everyone's stories and the dystopian world at large setting. That's not going to happen in a few hundred pages. But I think it was elegantly written (as are all of Lauren's Olivers novels) and ended exactly how it should have. I will continue to read anything Lauren Oliver cranks out.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I didn't want it to end, and now there is no more. RIP Bob. Thanks for a great ride. And thanks to Sanderson for keeping it alive just long enough. Great job
B007SGM084|4.0|I admit, I fell into the hype surrounding the first book, 50 Shades of Grey. It was decent. But the rest of the trilogy was just ok. The writing style isn't that great.... she repeats similar/same phrases a lot. And the intimate portions got to be a little repetitive for me also. Kinda like &#34;same s*** different day&#34; ... so by the third book I found myself skipping over entire paragraphs where it was going on. I'm glad I read it so I could see what all the hype was about, but this wouldn't be something I would pick up and read again. Too much hype for nothing.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Balsamic is an excellent story teller and, when in a series, flawlessly transitions from one book to the next. Each e could even be a stand alone, as evidenced through the Camel Club series.  Provides just enough action to keep you going without so much that you say \\"bull bunny\\". One of my favorite authors.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I over this game I have it on Pc xbox and now here great if yore a minecraft fan grow at
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is everything I was looking for. I was looking for a game just like GTA and surprisingly gameloft did a good job with this!
B005XR3K5M|4.0|As a Zelda fan, these cards really hit home. Intricate design, great concept. Cards are even decent quality. Very pleased.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Just like grand theft auto more like saints row the best game I played on a tablet it's nice u start out with a lot of money and u beat the crap out of people so fun and addicting!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book with hypnotic storyline. Definitely leaves you wanting more. Should have bought the<br />3-pack. Warning!  Don't read this at work ;)
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Terrible and slow paced don't read it it is a terrible book it stinks the movie was much better than the book
B005HEEMGW|1.0|This was not enjoyable at all.  Very silly.  The characters act in a way that would not be expected in a situation like this.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Compared to other versions this one has a whole bunch of new birds. You get to compete with your friends and family.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Before the hype a long time ago-- the original Sherlock was actually a good read.  Read the book that has heavily influenced our culture, our storytelling and so much more.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly provides a glimpse into a nitty-gritty future, where people have real motivations, and aren't always the most altruistic person they can be.  The cast of characters on the Firefly class star ship named Serenity have all been thrust into their predicament for different reasons, each hoping to achieve their own goals, but collectively most just wanting to stay a little further than the long-armed reach of the Alliance.  Relationships and friendships are formed, while they depend on each other to get them out of many different and exciting scrapes.<br /><br />The cinematography was progressive at the time, is still some of the best in the Sci-Fi genre, and holds up pretty well outside the genre.  For example, Joss Whedon, the creator and director, made a choice to use a shaky-cam for some of his shots, where the conventional wisdom of the day was to use a steady-cam; this added to the work-load of the CG-artists, but the effect gives a perfect perception of weight and action, and you can see the effect in popular use today in Sci-Fi movies like Star Trek: Into Darkness.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about the series is that it ended so early, due to some corporate decisions.  You end up caring about the characters, wondering if they make it.  Fortunately, Joss Whedon's crew and the fans were both persistent and dedicated enough to convince the powers that be to allow them to make a movie entitled, &#34;Serenity&#34; that wraps up many of the loose threads.  Make sure you watch the series, and then when you want more of this epic universe, watch the movie; it'll make much more sense, and you'll catch a lot of those little throw-backs to the series.<br /><br />&#34;No power in the 'verse can stop me.&#34; - River Tam
B009FZFONO|5.0|You'll be caught up to Season 4 before you realize you haven't mowed your lawn for a week, and work was calling wondering if you were alright.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I love action movies -- and have no problems with plot flaws at the expense of good action. I love the Lee Child Books. So this seemed like a great option for Movie Night Saturday.<br /><br />Good lord it was awful. Stilted dialogue, slow moving, completely confusing. We turned it off after 45 minutes.<br /><br />Tom Cruise -- you are no Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Save yourself and avoid this movie.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The last book fell short. I even found myself nodding off to sleep. I've always been excited to read the next installment of Sookie's life, but this was an utterly awful attempt at a way to end the series. The storyline had no depth and no expansion as the previous books. I still finished the book because I still had some shred of hope of redemption, however, I was disappointed again. Maybe it's a good thing that the series is over, to save some dignity for the series itself and not kill it entirely.
0393343405|5.0|Listened to the book on tape and fell in love with it.  Highly recommended for all free thinkers and Epicurians!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The sex scenes aren't that hot, started skipping them halfway through the second book. They're for submissives and younger gals. I do enjoy the storyline though.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I am a huge hendrix fan  and this didnt make me say I have to listen to even one cut again. It was a tiny bit ho hum  radio one was better
B000HF6XV8|5.0|My class reads this book every year.  I finally decided to buy the movie for my classroom collection.  The children enjoy finding the differences between the book and movie (though in this movie it stays pretty true to the book compared to other movies)<br />I tell the children, &#34;Read the book before you watch the movie.&#34;
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|so far i have used it for a couple days. Its just taking some time to get used to the mouse. Been using a logitech g9x mouse for a couple years now and i loce that mouse. So far with using this one its almost the same just 3 button on the side. I like the button record feature on it. Pretty nice and high tech. Thanks again and im enjoying the use of it! =]
1400049628|5.0|In the case of such an event ever -would- happen, you can count on this book actually providing realistic and very serious guidelines for a highly unlikely, fictional scenario.<br /><br />For a fan of a zombie outbreak, this is not a bad choice of a read.
0449911357|5.0|I'm half way through the book and I love it! The movie &#34;Fried Green Tomatoes&#34; is my favorite movie, So I decided to buy the book and I'm not disappointed...Idgie's and Ruth's relationship is portrayed stronger and more affectionate than the movie. Also it has a lot of additional stuff that will help you understand some things in the movie better. I recommend!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I already downloaded all of these songs but I decided to buy the album so I could listen to it in the car, on my stereo system, and just to have it as my own .. kind of like a collectable . But you should definently buy this album . If you can't buy it then listen to him on YouTube , you won't be disappointed ! -XO
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I originally picked up this book in Ireland while on a business trip.  I had lost my own husband only a year or two prior, and reading this story absolutely touched my heart and soul.  It made me cry, made me laugh, made me remember love and loss, and stayed with me for years.  I enjoyed the movie version when it came out, but it was so different from the book that I promised myself I would read it again one day.  I finally watched the movie again recently and decided I had to buy the book and re-read it.  I am so glad I did.  This is an amazing story that touches my heart over and over again every time I read it or watch it on screen.  I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to know what true love feels like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the best book EVER!!!!!!! i would recomend it to any body except squemish people because it is very gory, but at the same time, it is romantic
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great way to make it very fun for kids and terns. Keep it up your doing great<br />on this app
B0094K1MH2|1.0|Considering the pedigree of the folks behind this film, it is truly disappointing. A real bomb. Don't waste your time on this one.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|I do not have the enhanced edition, so I am reviewing the basic CD release, which has one less track and no DVD. The 20 minute interview and live performances of older Purple songs didn't seem to me to be worth the extra 6 or 7 dollars.<br /><br />All in all, a nice CD. It takes some repeated listens to grow on you. It's not your mother's Deep Purple, but it is very good Deep Purple nonetheless. The sound/mix is superb, and there seems to be more of a leash on Steve Morse's guitar playing, i.e. more emphasis on the melodic as opposed to the the speed exercises. Don Airey does fine as we hear some good Hammond organ, and nice keys, and he gets some time to really stretch out (\\"A Simple Song\\")and shine. He is not Jon Lord, but no one else would be. He has his own sound.<br /><br />Gillan's vocals are at times thin and reedy, but the guy is in his late 60s so give him a break. Producer Bob Ezrin makes ample use of double tracking and vocal harmonies to bolster the singing, and it works. Gillan puts out a few dumb lyrics, but as Gillan said, the lyrics sometimes are there for percussive sound rather than meaning. The times that Gillan goes to his lower range, expecially on \\"All The Time In The World\\" and in the album opener \\"Simple Song,\\" his voice sounds full with nice grain and texture.<br /><br />I have read people saying it doesn't sound like \\"old\\" Deep Purple and still cry for the return of Ritchie Blackmore. Well, Ritchie hasn't been in the band for 19 years. Get over it. He's not coming back. Ever. Blackmore currently has an intense hatred of Gillan and will \\"never forgive\\" Roger Glover for the remixes he did on MACHINE HEAD. That bridge is long burned, and at age 68, Blackmore seems happy with what he is doing. Steve does fine, and his playing here is some of his best, as it seems to be, as stated earlier, a little more restrained. With Airey and Morse on board, it isn't going to sound like \\"old\\" Deep Purple.<br /><br />The songs are the best since the PERPENDICULAR album. I especially like the haunting parts of \\"A Simple Song.\\" The production shines and is clear. If anything, BANANAS and RAPTURE OF THE DEEP were muddy affairs, especially the drum sound. It is one of the best sounding records they have made. Producer Ezrin must have had some pull and influence, as he is credited as a co-writer along with the other band members.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the \\"Steve Morse\\" era of Deep Purple, you are going to like this. For the die hard Blackmore fans, probably nothing that the band does now will please you. I guess it's a matter of taste.<br /><br />Of course, this is a review of a rabid fan, who has loved all stages of this band.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|This film, a paranormal romance, was touted as the next \\"Twilight\\". Not even close.<br /><br />The main male romantic lead, played by Alden Ehrenreich, is a dufus hillbilly who speaks like Forrest Gump. He sounds and acts like a complete idiot. Whenever his character is onscreen you find yourself getting annoyed with him.<br /><br />Because of this main character, there's a campiness to the film. Either a film is camp and embraces it, like \\"Bordello of Blood\\", or it's a drama. You can't have both.<br /><br />There are a several excellent actors, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson, Margo Martindale (from \\"Justified\\") but their characters/performances are lost in this predictable mess of a film.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Well acted, great story.  Amazing how brutal we humans are back in the Middle Ages. It will make you appreciate living today.
0446572985|2.0|The Innocent is my first foray into Mr. Baldacci's books, and quite honestly, I am not terribly impressed so far.<br /><br />In support of this book, it is a fast-paced page-turner with many plot twists and surprises that kept me uncertain and guessing, and it was an entertaining read.  Unfortunately, the characters and story line came across to me as contrived, forced and implausible.  As others have commented, the writing-style is choppy and sophomoric, more akin to what I would expect from a high school student.  There is a lot of callous and seemingly superfluous killing and death dealt out in this book, and the stunted responses from the characters reminded me of a pulpy and silly made for TV series.  In the final say, The Innocent was not a terribly convincing or compelling book for me.<br /><br />I am not sure that I have given up on Baldacci, but The Innocent certainly makes me a bit skeptical of the rest of his stuff.
0385349947|5.0|This book is for everyone who has a girl or woman in your family or workplace, i.e. everyone. It is not a \\"feminist\\" book. She does not push for all women to be in the workplace, but has many suggestions that would be helpful for a woman and her partner who would like to improve the work experience of the partner or mother who wants to work. And even if a woman is staying at home to raise her family this may change her outlook on the world to the benefit of her family.<br /><br />It is not just for women or working women. This book is for every person who has any interest in the talents of women and how to maximize them. It is excellent for people to discuss the ideas with have girls in their families. It has an emphasis on how businesses and families can benefit from the presence of women in the workplace and encouraging women whether they are now working or will work or if you have women in your family old or young, senior or child. This book is about awakening awareness.<br /><br />I cannot do full justice to this book in this review, so I'll just list the chapter titles. I do want you to know that this is not simply a book of ideas and opinions. Sheryl has EXTENSIVE notes supporting or expanding upon her statements.<br /><br />She has specific observations on how women in the workplace can themselves learn to act to their advantage and how men in the workplace can improve the workplace by changing their attitudes or mentoring or just being aware of differences between men and women which can be utilized or adapted to the benefit of everyone.<br /><br />The chapters are:<br />A. Introduction: Internalizing the Revolution<br />1. The Leadership Ambition Gap: What Would You Do if You Weren't Afraid?<br />2. 2. Sit at the Table<br />3. Success and Likeability<br />4. It's a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder<br />5. Are You My Mentor?<br />6. Seek And Speak Your Truth<br />7. Don't Leave Before You Leave<br />8. Make Your Partner A Real Partner<br />9.

B005ZB91KY|2.0|That's about it. First part of movie was good then it just became action, fighting, explosions that seemed to be just filler that would only appeal to juveniles.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister and she has it constantly playing in her car. Great price!
B000ZNRBK4|3.0|It serves it's purpose, but I often remove it to use the rotating polarizing filter without getting finger marks on the filter itself.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I loved Dr. Seuss books as a kid partially because they didn't try to push any heavy agenda.  It was just silly for the sake of entertainment.  This one doesn't give you enough time to soak in the colorful visuals before the characters start yelling, squealing, and speeding through all sorts of slapstick action scenes.  There is enough material here for a terrific 24 minute tv special, but not nearly enough for a whole movie.  Kids will accept it anyway.
B0067EKYS6|3.0|First -- I enjoyed this movie.  It is well done, beautifully photgraphed with excellent costuming, but it really strays from the book to such an extent that it really isn't \\"The Great Gatsby\\" but more like a movie that was \\"suggested by\\" the book.  In this film Gatsby plays a much larger role and lacks all of the mystery that surrounds him in the book.  Tom plays a much smaller role and is much less of a cad while Wilson and Myrtle seem like an after thought. The connections between Tom, Myrtle, and Wilson are just hinted at.  Admittedly this film goes out its way to address and answer some of the questions about Gatsby's past that are hinted at in the book.  Daisy plays a much larger role here than in the book which makes the movie entertaining but really is only hinted at in the book. Perhaps the worst deviation from the book is the very end where the car isn't being driven by Tom but is driven by Daisy. I failed to see the need to do this other than to reach an ending which was very different from the book, other than death of Gatsby.  Still I liked the movie and DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire did a good job.<br /><br />I hated the sound track which pandered to contemporary music tastes but seemed out of place in the movie.  The same with the choreography which sort of hinted at the Charleston and other contemporary dances.  I gave this film three stars because it is a good movie and worth seeing but it really isn't \\"The Great Gatsby\\" as written by Fitzgerald.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|The story is good, pace is good, director is good.<br />Normally, women will keep their child not the guy.<br />One thing, he should know he arouse when meet a guy, no need to wait after first kiss.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was good, but a little dramatic.  It gave me anxiety with the things that each of them did.  The sex scenes were awesome though!
B009AMANBA|2.0|I did not watch all of the movie because the language was unnecessarily bad.  The part I watched seemed to be set on showing how votes were bought and manipulated by Lincoln to serve his agenda.  Very disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|enjoyed this book very much. My great niece told me about it. It was well written and easy to follow the story line.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Well, yes, I have Net Flix. Yes, I stream. I saw this movie on the big screen and on the small screen and I love the vocals.
B00699SDR8|5.0|On the quality of the product:<br /><br />Ok, so I was assigned to read a hard copy of this book for english class in high school. Since the number of pieces the book was in started to get hazy as pages and even chapters would go missing, I decided to invest in a kindle version of the book, so I could highlight things, make notes, and not lose parts of the book. All that jazz. The product was delivered and works in just the way I envisioned it. (success!)<br /><br />On the quality of the book:<br /><br />The story is very accessible. You can be a 12 year old and understand all of the words and logic in the book very well. The ideas present in the book are very important, that involve things all humans should think about. Spirituality, logic, divine providence, and all sorts of other philosophical discussion/contemplation topics. When I'm trying to articulate my own viewpoint, I'll reference this book or reread a chapter so I completely understand the idea, or the time period it was first invented. While its not a gripping plot by any means, its fascinating as a springboard to a wide spectrum of pondering and debate. I highly recommend it to all people interested in learning and understanding the world of philosophy.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very good book. It provides a succinct view on Nicolas Tesla a truly amazing man and story.Well worth a read.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Well made game. The controls are simple and responsive.The physics are cool and the upgrades are effective. Good mindless fun.
023076651X|5.0|Made me stop planning and start doing. All my barriers and hesitations are gone. Anyone trying to start a business should read this.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love it! Rick has done it again with \\"Mark of Athena\\". I can't wait for fall 2013 for his next book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book for the superb development of Pat' and Tiffany's personalities. Mr Matthew Quick wrote a really wonderful interaction between Pat and Tiffany.
0399165274|5.0|Forsyth came to fame in 1971 with The Day of the Jackal, a gripping thriller about the search for an anonymous contract killer who had been paid to assassinate French president Charles De Gaulle. He deserved the fame he got for the book because it really was good! That was his second book and first novel. Since then, a string of others has followed of exceptionally high quality.  So here we are , seventeen books and fourteen novels later,and here  is The Kill List, which is another knockout spy thriller by Forsyth.<br /><br />You don't read Forsyth novels for lush description or depth of the character development. Basically, you read them for plot. Forsyth is a pro at laying out exciting but credible high action narratives, based on the most recent of events and thus exceedingly relevant. He's an info wonk who knows and can explicate, without excess verbiage, the details that lend credence to his sometimes exceedingly complicated stories: in this current one, the technology of modern long distance spying, the ins and outs of politics (national and international), what to do if you forced to negotiate with Somali pirates, how to carry off a successful high risk \\"black op\\" while keeping it well below the radar screen.<br /><br />Forsyth is a bare bones, no nonsense kind of writer who tells you only as much about his protagonists as you need in order to understand what they're doing and why they did it. He's not all that interested in local color but a fair amount of it still appears in his novels any way because his plots move across colorful and often dangerous terrains.<br /><br />Kill List is about the hunt for an Arab terrorist, named the \\"Preacher,\\" who has been inciting young Muslims in the United States and Britain to commit random individual acts of terrorism. (There have been seven killings in the States and four in Great Britain.) The Preacher has learned from his predecessors, who made the mistake of letting themselves become visible and thus reachable.  As a consequence, the Preacher operates solely over the Internet with his face  masked. He has no apparent contact with disciples. He doesn't even use a cell phone because its  signal can be isolated by high flying satellite spy planes and subsequent calls traced.<br /><br />After a series of assassinations in the States, provoked by the Preacher's rantings against the West, the Preacher's name is placed on a super secret, eminently deniable Kill List, which is composed solely of enemies deemed so dangerous to our country that their deaths have been authorized ahead of time, with no questions asked. The agency responsible for dealing them bears the innocuous name of Technical Operations Support Activity (TOSA) but its operations are decidedly  lethal. The number two man in TOSA is Army colonel Kit Carson.<br /><br />Then one of the Preacher's acolytes kills Kit's father, a retired general.  Kit takes it personally. Finding and eliminating the Preacher becomes his main priority.<br /><br />Henceforth, Kit is usually referred to as \\"Tracker,\\" which is what he is and does as he moves from Washington, D. C., to London, then Kabul, with stops in Qatar and Dubai, and on to Djibouti and Mogadishu. Along the way, he's aided by a neurotic teenager who's a computer ace, operatives from Israeli intelligence, and a high-end and decidedly lethal assault team from the British forces.<br /><br />The result is fascinating, hard to put down, another sure winner from a master at crafting high tension thrillers.a consequence, the Preacher operates solely over the Internet with his face  masked.

B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|This album seems to be trying to ride off the momentum that was created with the brilliant and powerful, \\"This Is War\\". Many elements of the previous record are intact. The choir chants (ohs and whoas), heavy use of synths, and soaring vocals. Like other reviewers have stated, there is just something missing. Lyrically and thematically it seems somewhat lost. The choruses also aren't as strong or memorable on this effort. Songs like \\"kings & Queens\\", \\"Closer to the Edge\\", \\"Night of the Hunter\\", and \\"Vox Populi\\" sent chills down my spine. Those tunes had me hitting the accelerator and flying down the Freeway. I can't say so much for this one. It's a shame because \\"Up in the Air\\" is a pretty tremendous song, very much in the vain of \\"This is War\\". It's definitely worth a listen. Perhaps over time it will grow on me.
0375842209|4.0|It's a really powerful book that was enjoyable to read throughout. It offers a very interesting take on nazi Germany from the perspective of Death. It took my a while to get used to reading from Death's perspective, but it was really cool once I got into the flow of things. The only thing I didn't like is how Death sometimes spoils what's going to happen. Ah, but it was great anyhow. You'll really enjoy it.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Great read for a science lover or a physics lover read this with your family and they'll love the book
0553573411|3.0|This one has most everything one can enjoy from this type of story and I was thoroughly entertained throughout.<br /><br />The pacing is slightly off at times and Fitz doesn't really go outside of Buckeep very much at all in this story, which limits the adventure feel that most fantasy novels contain...but really, it's not that big of a deal. For what it lacks in adventure it certainly makes up for with some really cool magic, romance, action, and characters. The first half of this book is almost tooooo much of a love story, but to be fair, it was pretty-preeettty-prettyyy good and it didn't bother me much, especially considering how it prepares you to really feel for characters and scenes that show up later in the story. The magic introduced in the first book gets some awesome uses in this one and it can get pretty epic.<br /><br />Fitz' relationships with all the characters are way better developed this time around and each deliver something unique for the reader to appreciate, making Fitz a whole lot more likable in the process. Also, the antagonists in this story really step it up, delivering some dramatics and flare that were a bit lacking in the first of the series. It all leads to an extremely satisfying ending full of twists and excitement that I think any nerdy fantasy reader is sure to enjoy.<br /><br />It seems like Hobb got a way better feel for the world she created this time around and it really shows. Everything was delivered near flawlessly and the satisfaction I got from reading this one is undeniable. I've already got the order through amazon, and I'm eagerly anticipating starting the 3rd and final of the trilogy.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I hope there will be sequel. While influenced by 1970's Spaghetti Westerns, this well-written award-winning update is a must see for all action movies lovers.
0765348276|1.0|I feel like this might've been something I would have enjoyed in the 4th grade, maybe. But I'd like to think I wasn't ever reading something this dumbed down and enjoying it. This book is so incredibly unoriginal, it's painful to read at times. The story is decent enough, though it's nothing special, but what really harms the story most is how immature the prose is. Scalzi writes pretttyyy alright, I guess, but his thoughts are just so juvenile, it's embarrassing. He constantly goes off on tangents on things only a grade schooler might find entertaining, like farts. Then he seems to get a real kick out of having his characters have several sex sessions in in the span of 5 pages and it reads like it's coming from someone who may have never even kissed a girl, let alone fornicate. And oh my god, what a terrible sense of humor, his idea of funny is having all his main characters name their Brainbots (or whatever) curse words, like \\"a--hole\\" or \\"b----\\". And the characters...just think of every cheesy military movie you've ever seen and take away any bit of real personality or color the characters had and keep the most generic of traits and you might be close.<br /><br />I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he stole every word/page/idea of this book from a nerdy, pimply faced freshman in high school. And honestly, even if it was me who had written this in high school as a freshman, I would hope my friends would at least have the sense to make fun of me and crack jokes behind my back about how utterly stupid and unoriginal my book was.<br /><br />1/10.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I wanted to be able to edit the photos I took directly on my Kindle Fire, and this was the perfect app for that. I can add frames, crop, and adjust color. No complaints.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|It isn't what you'd expect from Vampire Weekend. There is a slower pace to this album and more thought put into the lyrics (I think). It isn't as fun as Contra or as new and refreshing as the first album was... But there is some incredible type of beauty to these songs that must be heard a few times to really appreciate it. Vampire weekend is one of my favorite bands right now and this just might be their best album yet.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I got the first 4 seasons on DVD from a friend, and I blazed through them in a few weeks, watching them on my laptop in the kitchen as I cook. I had to get Season 5 and 6 as soon as I finised the 4! It is a silly, zangy show with funny characters who become your friends as you watch the show.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This is interesting reading but seems like a lot of bragging himself up. I still think Carlos Hathcock was the best sniper out there.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|If you like taking notes, this is the way to go. I dislike the standard notepad app, so this one was a good option for me.
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|got me started running, very sincere and impressive, I love it, its an amazing book, I suggest it to everyone
B004EPZ07K|4.0|This movie is a comic book come to life. I think that is why the critics and viewers had a hard time with it. It is actually very true to the old Green Lantern mythos. I think people were expecting something with a bit more angst or something and not just a playful romp through the DC universe. However, I must say that my favorite part of the movie was Sinestro--that actor just mesmerized me on the screen with his acting! Too bad there won't be a Green Lantern 2. This movie deserves another chance...and a sequel.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The acting is superb.  Thoroughly captivating performances and story line.  Highly recommended for more of a male audience....definitely not your average love story!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This is a mesmerizing movie as far as the animation is concerned and the characters are all very appealing. It can be a bit formulaic and, of course, does the usual tugging-at-the-heartstrings thing but is still a fun movie. Kids will love it and most adults will too.
B004OR199G|5.0|A wonderfully written book with good houmor and great recipes.<br />Loved the author's way of expressing herself and her view of life.<br />A great read for anyone who is looking for a healthier way to eat and live.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Don't know what Tarantino was trying to accomplish with this one.  Big name actors and some funny lines but overall a pointless movie. Movie drags on at times with too much dialog.
B004ULNJIU|3.0|It as an ok movie, but I'd not buy it again. I missed this at the theaters and think most of his stuff is darn good, but this flick just didn't do it. Maybe it needs to be viewed in a theater for it to work.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|I have been a Freddy Mercury fan for years but it wasn't until I was in England visiting family that I became aware of this cd. So I ordered it and it was here when I got back. I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it many times. It was fun to read about how the whole thing came together in the accompanying literature. I am so glad that I bought it!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am continuing to enjoy the story line and looking forward to more! I find myself alternating cheers between Will and Peter, LOL
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Still the best, most engaging version of this classic tale with a cast to die for, Theysimply don't make them like this anymore.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I thought this show was going to be centered around politics but I was pleasantly surprised with the story line.  Very well done and  kept me coming back for more!
B00348K1I6|5.0|Excellent portrayal of the life of the Great Malcolm X. Denzel played an excellent role and the production by Spike Lee was perfect.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book gave me everything I needed to know to get started with my lifting routine and diet! Mike gives just the right amount of advice and coaching so as not to overwhelm you but at the same time everything you really need to know. I had my wife read his other book Thinner Leaner Stonger and she loved that book as well. I keep coming back to this book as I tweak my routine or fine tune what I have already learned. After you read this book you won't look at lifting the same way again. Thanks Mike!
B004SKJTY6|2.0|As I said, I thought this was the movie so I was disapointed. Should have paid more attention. This was not that interesting.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Enjoyable read, well written, didn't expect the ending! Chosen by my book club so not sure I would have read this on my own,  but certainly glad I did!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought the second was better than the first.  Starting the third now.  I hope it is as good or better.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|Lacking details of the basic concepts of the inception process. Viewer is asked to believe to many weakly backed ideas.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie was very informative and eye opening. I learned so much from watching this movie and now I'm on a quest to pay more attention to my food and such. Who knew that we as consumers were being lied to so much! Watch this movie! It is worth every penny because you just might end up saving your own life and even the life of others.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Truly pleased with the movie; no scratches or interruptions. Great quality. Really like the movie. It meets all of my expectations.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Omg omg omg! This was the best book I've read in awhile. I love a book with humor. But I'll say this, the sex scenes were off the hook sexy. Drew was so funny and so were his friends. I would love to know who Emma used to give her a guys point of view. Hysterical! I loved everything about this book. Emma Chase rocks!!!
B006A6EDQU|5.0|This book, written by a literary agent, deals with the pitfalls made by aspiring authors and I am one of those. The main theme is that literary agents receive thousnds of unsolicited manuscripts and they are looking for the classic errors made by amateur authors so the manuscript can be dumped on the reject pile after reading the first few pages. Of great assistance as far as I am concerned are the examples of bad writing and the exercises at the end of each chapter.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great author, great writing! Child makes it easy to understand the most complex situations and really feel what the characters are feeling. His books are substantial - definitely worth the money!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was a real nice video were it looks like things  was floating in our living room this is real<br />entertainment. and reasonable price just wish the neighbors would stay home sometime lol.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I chose two stars because while it does run on my phone, it won't update the previous version.  A second copy of this game was installed when I downloaded this via Amazon the Marketplace.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|They show a lot of different planes and such in the intro for this product but the FREE app charges to get any other plane.  I don't like apps like that, I figure if it is free, it's free!!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I plugged it into my laptop running Linux and it was recognized instantly and perfectly. I've been using it with the Foxtrot GPS app on road trips and it has been working excellently. There are several other Linux-based GPS apps that can use it but I haven't had time to try them out yet.
B000FA675C|5.0|I first saw the movie and liked it and usually the book is always better and it was.  I am reading some of the other Dan Brown books now.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|I won't spend a lot of time repeating what others have said.  But if you liked The Bourne Identity, you will love this one.  Even faster-paced than the first, and the taxi chase scene and the knife versus rolled-up magazine fight scene alone are worth the rental fee.  As in the first, Damon somehow makes us care about the fate of relentless killing machine Jason Bourne, giving the movie an emotional core generally lacking from the genre, even with the new director's more frenetic style.
B00CS65JS2|3.0|In a nutshell, I would summarize the sound of this album as retro 70s with robots and soul singers. Not what I was expecting, but at least they are not always churning out the same dance floor sounds like DeadMau5 or other electro artists.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|Sometimes with these action movie series, you can skip the first one, or watch them out of order, and not miss too much.  But seeing as the Bourne trilogy is almost as character-driven as action-driven, you really need to see the first one first.  Damon manages to make the audience emotionally invested in Bourne, a highly efficient killing machine created by a secret government operation (of course), and his get-away partner, Marie.  That emotional connection to Bourne resonates througout the series and humaizes the character, even throughout all the car chases, fist-fights, and explosions.  Highly recommend!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Awesome game<br />Works great on my kindle love the action<br />$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&amp;<br />Love it love it love it<br />Play this game you will love it
B007DIQC90|5.0|These people make really fun, catchy music. We put this on in the car and have had it as a regular choice ever since it arrived. Very eager to hear their next CD.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. IT IS GREAT. You can wake up to music, ringtones, and other things. It also sets a reminder for the next alarm. Th app is free so you don`t have to pay and regret it.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying that the movie started out great. It was gritty, disturbing, and drew me right in. The death scenes were downright sickening to watch, along with a hint of ingenuity throughout. At one point, I even told my wife that I wanted to stop watching since I was so afraid.<br />I quickly lost this about 60% of the way in as the movie began to (spoiler alert) signify a more undead or haunted aspect. Also, who hears a noise in their house in the middle of the night, and does not turn on all the lights to see what is going on? Spooky: yes. Realistic: not necessarily. Especially with children in the house.<br />The movie had great potential from the beginning. The premise was fairly original- a crime author who moves into the homes of victims to get the best feel for his new novels. The scares started shortly after with surprising scenes and loud noises that made me jump just about every time. It started to lose me over halfway through, and the ending I didn't particularly care for. Having said this, I did not suspect the actual killer was who it ended up being. Kind of a tricky, possession twist.<br />Do I recommend this movie: Sure. Try it out for a well placed thrill, some well written scenes, cheap scares, and decent acting. Do not get your expectations up for the end. I felt it built right up simply to fall kind of flat. Not disappointing; just too exemplified for what it was.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|This game sucks you cant play multiplayer it drops everytime i tried 20 30 times the triggers dont work such as starting missions so u just get stuck on the story line not able to d ok anything but fight glitched out npcs who regenerate their heath in milliseconds
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|To begin, I will say that this is alike no other Bond film yet. It starts off with a well played action scene, and holds this action and excitement for the better part of the movie.<br />The director saw fit to add in some different film styles throughout, including silhouette fights atop towers and vast character portrayals in archirval types. The villain in this movie is truly an archetype, being evil, intelligent, and foreplanning for any possible move. Javier was an excellent choice to play the villain, due to his ability to undertake extremely dark and varying roles.<br />Daniel Craig does a great job playing Bond in this film and even stretches the role a bit in parts past what any other Bond has done yet. Skyfall takes the Bond role to a different part, moving from secret missions and intelligence gatherings to a barricade in James' old house growing up and exotic islands.<br />Do I recommend this film? Absolutely. Skyfall has something for just about everyone. Bond has truly met a worthy adversary in this film, thanks to great writing.<br />The only downfall to this was the somewhat anti-climactic ending. I felt the (spoiler!) bad guy died much too quickly, excluding some type of struggle or fight to the death, characteristic of almost every Bond film in history. As I said before, this takes the Bond formula to new levels and rewrites the playbook. Check it out!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This is 40 is the hilariously drawn comedy about a couple who is steadily aging, and realizing that life is not quite what they expected. While raising children, they try to juggle their jobs and relationships all at once and cope with the fact that they are not getting any younger.<br />Paul Rudd was the great redeeming feature of this movie for me, given his natural talent for comedy and simply funny mannerisms. Had it been anyone else, I doubt I would have enjoyed this movie as much. Hi wife, played by Leslie Mann, has a natural knack for playing the b**chy woman in a relationship, as we saw from their performances together in Knocked Up.<br />I enjoyed most aspects of this movie, and took many of the comedic aspects to heart. The part with Paul Rudd using the toilet to escape family: hilarious! The realism of a couple with money troubles and spending problems: well played. His downfalls in his career and lack of sales: a good addition to the story.<br />All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes romantic comedies, and don't mind the extra intertwined drama in this movie. It is most likely the only thing stopping me from giving it a full 5 stars: the drama and yelling that played no part into the storyline, and then the sudden getting back together after no discussion. I realize this happens, but it is not my particular taste for comedies.<br />Do I recommend this movie: absolutely. Check it out for some good laughs and a fun story.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|The 1998 version with Liam Neeson was so incredibly better!!! It's a story of redemption and this version did not capture that hardly at all. It was more about the French Revolution.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I usually don't leave a review till the end but since they keep hugging me to do it while I am already frustrated with the game I'll leave a review. It's like this game doesn't realize it's on a touch screen. I have to continuously tap the screen to get it to do what I want. Which makes it real hard during the HOG. I'll. touch an item and keep touching it then it penalizes me. Then which I never do I push hint and it shows me the item I kept trying to get. I know its not my kindle messing up because I went to another game and it worked just fine. Plus so far it's way too much back and forth. It's a slow story line. It might end well I haven't got there yet. Cost is good if it worked better.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|it is so awesome I told all my friends about it I regret nothing it is the best card game ever
6305428387|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family.  Fun, light-hearted, and a little witty.  You can never go wrong getting a childhood favorite on DVD.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I enjoyed seeing the stories of these very different women and how they dealt with pregnancy/parenthood. It was great to see multiple perspectives and experiences, and I was glad to see that the girl with the unplanned pregnancy was ready to cope with it and did not even mention having an abortion. She and the guy were willing to work through the consequences of their choices, even in a self-sacfrificial way. The adoption story made me cry. And the &#34;perfect&#34; pregnancy made me laugh. Fun movie.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|A must have movie for Disney movie lovers and collectors!! A great movie!! I was raised with this movie and now my 13 month old son is going to be raised with it too!! Wonderful movie for all ages!!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I LOVE THIS CASE! I brought it underwater for the first time and got amazing results! The only thing I didn't like was that underwater, you couldn't press the picture button and that the inside always filled with air making it hard to type. BUT WORTH IT.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an awesome story!  Did you see that coming?  Cause I didn't!  Definate must read and I'm looking forward to more of Colleen Hoover's books!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Stellar cast---a remarkable accomplishment for Universal, as many of their movies are appealing only to the young set. It is religiously accurate in dialogue from the original production that I have seen on the stage twice.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Up until now I've been using the stock heatsink (Not recommended) with my FX-8120 processor. Before I used to get 40~45C while idle and 59~63C while under high load.<br /><br />Now my idle temperatures are 20~25C and high load temperatures are roughly 30~35C.<br /><br />One thing you should know before you buy this is the size. The heatsink is enormous and just barely fits in my Rosewill Destroyer case. Be sure to measure the dimensions to check if it fits.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I'm a big Archer fan. I really enjoy his other books and have read the Clifton Chronicles with interest.  I waited ~1yr for this book and pre-ordered it.  I thought that the book dragged for the first half, started to get interesting the last 100 pages then ended as abruptly as the first two.  I feel like there was a big investment in reading this one without the payoff.  I feel like Archer has created each book in this series simply to sell the next one.  I have no doubt that I'll buy and read the next in the series, but will probably not pre-order and waiting the way I was for this one.  I'll also be prepared to be left unsatisfied with the end.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Excellent, I wear it everyday and you can fit 2 cameras....Perfect, fits my lens and ipad as well. The price got me as well
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is da bestest app ever!!! I love soooooo much. I play it every day and night. I TOTALLY think u shud get dis app.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Many great scenes including the beginning with  the dragon attack. But toomany VERY long sequences, including the battle in the moutains.Actingis very good. Especially the perfornaces by Ian & the actors playing Bible & Thorin. And a unbelieavbly good performance by Kate Blancet, it so great that you can feel the chillings !
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Love it best horse movie ever made and it great for the family to watch. Could watch it a million times
B00CL50LEC|5.0|This flick is destine to be a cult classic. It has lots of inuwindows to todays society that may open or reopen your eyes to todays generation's lack of communication and understanding. Definitely stoked I purchased this one. Just my opinion.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Need I say more if you have not seen this it is a must see and you should not go to your maker without seeing it
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I think this is one of Demi's best albums ever! This album is so inspirational and many fans can relate to some of these songs.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This movie is a true work of art. But if your idea of entertainment is watching the latest Kim Kardashian reality show, then you will most assuredly NOT like it. Cloud Atlas will tug your emotions in every direction, and most importantly, it will encourage you to contemplate more than just the phony surface of our modern ego-driven existence. There are lessons here for everyone, but you must be patient enough to discover them - which will require more than one viewing. And it also helps if you turn on 'closed captioning' for at least one complete viewing, so that you can appreciate every word of the wonderful dialogue.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this game is fun decaues if you like cuting hair you should get this game and it is really fun
B009DJB8I2|2.0|Well,i bought this amazing soundtrack at 13.99$,I thought this was worth the value,but i'm wrong,you know,sometimes they send you a used one,i don't think this thing would happen myself,but when i certainly get my stuff,i realized i'm wrong.I ordered this at 20th March,and received at 20th May(Standard international shipping),kept waiting for 2 months and one of the copy is ridiculous,it seems brand new,but when i opened the CD box,guess what?I got 2 same disc of the disc 4,and the disc 1 has gone nowhere,then the most important thing is that the comic book/code were gone too.Do you think it's \\"Brand New\\"?I don't think so,whoever get this would know that it was stolen by the former people who received this copy,I really doesn't like this ridiculous mistake.<br />Guys,Just check this CAREFULLY!!!

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Thoughtfully written with beautiful descriptive passages. The friend Roses long stories and the whole genuine Irish dwell to this story was lovely. Also humor filled with certain Irish flare. The painful memories of the orphanage were so harsh though I understand the authors intent on using them. All in all I wanted more when the story ended.

0765365278|5.0|Just finished the audiobook.  First, the story written by Sanderson is absolutely phenomenal.  I finished a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about it and all the characters.  It amazes me how Sanderson can get into the mind of each character and write their thoughts, feelings and emotions so well.  The story starts off a bit slow but just keeps building upon itself into an incredible overall story.  As far as the audiobook goes, I don't think it gets nearly enough credit.  Michael Kramer did an amazing job giving each character their own voice without sounding like he's voice-acting a cartoon.  He gives subtle inflections or accents that allows you to distinguish who's speaking in a way that immerses you into the story even more.  Kate Reading also did an amazing job for the narration the female character chapters.  Overall, one of the best entertainment experiences I've ever had.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I had never heard of Kendrick Lamar when I read some raving reviews on Internet about it. I decided to give it a chance.<br />I put the songs on my IPhone along some other rap I own and let it play randomly.<br />I quickly realized that there were some excellent songs on my Iphone and more often than not when I checked, it would be Kendrick Lamar.<br />So I listened to the album from first to last and I got blown away. I am currently addicted to this album. It tells a story. The chapters are somehow not contiguous but you understand the idea of the album pretty quickly. The story in itself is fairly standard. It is about the contradictions of being a Good Kid in a Mad City. For those who may ask: MAAD stands for Made me an Angel on Angel Dust.<br />Where Kendrick shines as compared to the competion is in his delivery. He will alter his voice to give more emphasis on his points of view and the production is awesome.<br />If you like a good story, excellent rapping skills and awesome bass, give him a try. You may end up as addicted as I am.<br />Here is the track list:<br /><br />1. Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter's Daughter (Nice intro to the album, good bass, good ambiance, slow)<br />2. Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe (Groovy is not enough to describe it, excellent bass, excellent female voice)<br />3. Backseat Freestyle (Kendrick bragging about himself, as a kid would do in rap, very good rapping skills)<br />4. The Art of Peer Pressure (One of my least favorite)<br />5. Money Trees feat. Jay Rock (Another groovy title, Jay-Rock is very good on this)<br />6. Poetic Justice feat. Drake (A more pop type of rap, not my favorite style but still good)<br />7. good kid (Good Bass, not my favorite)<br />8. m.A.A.d city feat MC Eiht (The most violent track, also the best in my opinion, Kendrick shows his talent all through)<br />9. Swimming Pools (Drank) [Extended Version](One of the top tracks of this album, first one to attract my attention, Excellent production)<br />10. Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst (A more introversial rap, not my favorite style)<br />11. Real feat. Anna Wise of Sonnymoon (Another pop oriented rap but very well done)<br />12. Compton Feat. Dr. Dre (2nd contribution of Dr Dre on this album and about Compton indeed)<br />13. The Recipe feat. Dr. Dre (Very Very good anthem for LA. Excellent contribution from Dr Dre who gives one of his best rap to date)<br />14. Black Boy Fly (Good production)<br />15. Now or Never feat. Mary J. Blige (Nice cooperation)<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Do not get this album if you want to miss on the Rap revelation of 2011/2012. You have been warned!<br />Now, if you really do not like it, nothing will convince you of the contrary. Taste and colors are hard to debate...About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst (A more introversial rap, not my favorite style)<br />11. Real feat.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their personal attitude towards themselves and life In general.

I am now reading the 2nd book &#34;The Fifth Agreement&#34;
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the original movie series.  All 6 movies look great, and there are several features included for each film.  At the price of what two movies in the series can easily run, this set is the perfect way to gather the entire collection in their theatrical form.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This eating plan fits my lifestyle and it really works. Have so much energy and heightened awareness of my eating habits which used to involve huge portions. It works for me.

B00139XTG4|3.0|I like the idea of the &#34;Black Swan&#34; but the author presents very little to convince me of the validity of his point of view. I like the concept of the book, but to me the presentation of this philosophic point seems a bit weak. The approach seems a little informal and imprecise.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|If you have not had the chance to see this underated gem please add it to your must see list immediately!<br />To be honest, the first time I saw the film I didnt like it. I was also not in the right state of mind at the time<br />so most likely that was the issue. I saw it again months later and was blown away by how well made this film really<br />is. The directors attention to detail during that time period is amazing, the acting- stellar, and the story of the investigation is so interesting It's mind blowing. I was so impressed with this film that I bought the 2 disc directors cut<br />and have revisited the film 3 times already. The cool thing is i had the Zodiac book for years not knowing that the film<br />is based on the man who wrote it and how he sacrificed his job and family life to find the killers identity. Worth your time<br />trust me!

B00A2FSXHK|2.0|I wasn't prepared for  the thundering pace of the unfolding story line and I found it a bit hard to follow the details, but then I'm not a fan of action films anyway.  I watched it because a friend said it was a good model of the revolutionary theory that the modern mind aided by technology can stop crime before it happens.  The defect is we're all contaminated with a less than noble nature in need of redemption.

B00772M1F6|2.0|Very good album, a discovery for me through one of my friends. However, I decided not to buy it when I found out it was a digipak. Yes, another one of those cheap packagings that are not durable, cannot be replaced when worn out or bruised, which highly contribute to scratch your cds every time you take then out or back in, which don't fit in your cd library, etc. The industry has served them to us for far too long already! Sorry Mr. McPherson.

193700788X|1.0|I've been avoiding this because I thought some distance might make me feel better about this final effort.  Sadly, even Oklahoma wouldn't be enough distance for me to feel differently about Dead Ever After.<br /><br />First, let me preface this review with the fact that I loved this series up to and including Dead Reckoning (gave it four stars, despite the headscratching hidey-hole interaction with Bill).  I've loved the ethical issues the author presented and they way Sookie faced them, while not always head-on, with her own code of honor. I loved that the author said she intended the series to have a theme of tolerance and diversity.  I loved that an outcast in her human community could find a place where she was appreciated for who she was, despite not being the same as everyone else.  I had hoped at the end that Sookie would embrace her \\"essential spark\\" but it was not to be.<br /><br />About my disappointments.  *sigh*<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Honestly, perhaps my expectations were much too high but I know Charlaine Harris can write a hugely entertaining and satisfying book.  She's had years to think about the resolution of the series so I was expecting, and touting to others, a \\"knock it out of the ballpark\\" book.  My biggest disappointment is the feeling I had that she couldn't be bothered to write an Altogether Dead or even a Living Dead in Dallas.  She has obviously moved on.<br /><br />It also feels like she has taken the opportunity in DEA to take intentional jabs at some of her most ardent (well, those who were among her most ardent) fans.  \\"Literary fangbanger\\", what was the point of *that*?<br /><br />Sookie begins the series as someone who has been victimized and marginalized all of her life.  She ends the series back where she began.  She gives up what we heard from her in DR that she really wanted with no fight whatsoever, has sex with her best friend (not sexy sex, just sex), is going to be living right across the cemetary from the vampire who raped her and now has a legitimate purpose to continue lurking in her woods.  At the end, Sookie's just grateful to fit in with the miscreants who shunned her until she became like them herself, or at the very least appeared to be like them.  Sookie's as grateful for what she has in BT as she was for that regifted crockpot her bff (whose life she saved and who *owns* a women's boutique) gave her for her birthday.  She has no more self-esteem at the end than she did at the beginning.  I never thought I'd see Sookie as a victim despite all of her unfortunate experiences.<br /><br />Eric's gets virtually the same regifted crockpot.  He is under the thumb of a vampire queen, loses his \\"heart's desire\\", gives up what he values most (owning his life as much as he can) to protect the people he is responsible for.  He's Freyda's boy toy for a hundred years and gives up an extra hundred to try to arrange protection for Sookie and loses his children in the process.  We can feel good about though, right?  Um, no, it's not like FdC has been shown to make good on his debts...<br /><br />Sam, poor Sam.  He also gets the regifted crockpot.  Sookie's not passionate about him.  She's not even \\"in love\\" with him.  Eric's gone and he's just the next guy in line.<br /><br />Bill is a rapist.  He raped Sookie and now he's lurking in her woods until she dies or he gets staked.  I guess though he also gets the regifted crockpot.  He's not ever going to taste the sweetness of Sookie's fairy blood again . . . unless a nest of his buddies gets burned out, or he gets tortured and starved and can't help himself.  Just saying it's not beyond the realm of my imagination.  I'm sure we'll find in After Dead that he's BT's most sought after babysitter;)<br /><br />Finally, I guess my biggest disappointment is the message about diversity and tolerance this series leaves. You know, the one the author stated she intended?  I guess I thought it wasn't going to be that the vampires are too dangerous to live in human society, mainstreaming was an illusion, love for someone who is different from you is just too hard.  Sookie ends up with someone (maybe) that is most like her.  Supernatural but who looks human . . . most of the time.  In the end, does she even realize the vampires' have souls?  There seems to be some kind of religious message in this book as well, but I can't decipher what it is.  Apparently, someone needs to work on writing subtext.<br /><br />Not even going to mention continuity errors because it happens in this series and it's never been a fatal fail for me before.  Well, maybe I will mention one;)  Sookie tells Sam she can't read his mind in DEA but we know she can.  She read his mind about his trouble paying the beer distributor's bill.  She can read Bernie's (Sam's full shifter mom)in Small Town Wedding (although she prevaricates here too and tells Bernie it's hard to read shifters -- just after she's done so).  She reads Sam's detailed thoughts clearly several times in If I Had A Hammer, which Harris says is set after the end of the series.  So, either there is a huge continuity lapse here or Sookie lies to Sam like she did to his mother, to make them feel more comfortable around her I suppose.<br /><br />I've spent a huge portion of my sizeable book budget on this author's works over the past six years.  The bottom line (literal and metaphorical) is that's not ever going to happen again.  I take my disappointments seriously.<br /><br />I can't believe Penguin let her publish it as it is.o live in human society, mainstreaming was an illusion, love for someone who is different from you is just too hard.

B00AC4D5ME|5.0|Another great release by the MEN of &#34;BLUE&#34;. Every song is great and has shown off their maturity, yet, keeping with the fun that has made them a success. I could only hope for another release outside of this and the single &#34;I Can&#34;...
0062197266|5.0|More of a 4.5 stars, because this one was a bit tricky. Into the Darkest Corner is a engrossing cautionary tale of romance and obsession. It deals with loads of psychological issues in both their short and long term effects, and it was just so completely unputdownable I spent several hours in which I should have been studying for finals with my eyes stuck to Cathy Bailey's story.<br /><br />Basically, picture the following: You meet a guy, an intensely attractive and seemingly perfect guy, and ,out of some improbable conjunction of stars or rare alignment of planets, you both start dating. Your friends love him, he loves you, and it's all just red-paper hearts and champagne bottles, up until Perfect Guy starts veering a bit to the odd side. He doesn't like it when you go out with your friends without him, he has some very strong suggestions as to what you should wear, and, occasionally, the rough sex he has with you is less Fifty Shades of Gray than it is Fifthy Shades of Sore. Things get out of control and soon you find yourself beat up and traumatized, among other things, and as it manages to do once in a while, the system works and your ex goes to prison. Three years later, you're a different person, scared of people who aren't there, checking locks you know you already locked. Three years later, you might finally find happiness again. But three years later, is also when he gets out of jail, and you just know he's coming back for you.<br /><br />Into The Darkest Corner was fraught with tension and good writing, and despite veering towards the not-so-great as it neared its end, the book still had me hooked all through its 497 pages, plus it ended in a moment of ominous foreboding. I worried with Cathy, laughed with her, felt sorry for her, and was rejoiced to see her life finally make a turn for the better. As is the case with most thrillers, the ending doesn't make justice to the rest of the book, but despite that I burned through Into The Darkest Corner faster than I would most good books, and it is one of the best debuts I've read so far, along with Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects and S.J. Watson's Before I Go To Sleep.<br /><br />I don't believe this is a book for everyone, due to the heavy domestic violence it portrays, but I don't think it ought to be a issue for most, especially since Ms. Haynes manages to weave lighthearted, romantic moments perfectly with instances of either spine-tingling suspense or shocking violence. If you are looking for a thriller that will grab you by the neck and won't let go of it until all the pages are past you and you're left panting for air, Into the Darkest Corner is it.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|This CD is another reason why John Mayer is 'groovy' yet entirely prolific. I enjoy his music and the soothing, subtle emotions of his words. Favorite track...Assassins!

B005LAIHRC|5.0|This is the DVD for multiple listening, watching, enjoying and, if you are old enough, reliving. Adam Shankman did a great job to the stage musical, but, the musical and, more importantly, the MUSIC is what makes this awesome. A great follow up to his Hairspray!
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|it's very laggy on my phone. Compared to Temple Run 2, the game is not very responsive to finger swipes and gets very annoying. Not sure if anyone else has this, but if this is a bug, please fix it.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|I love this cd. Of course there are the songs that everybody knows that are great. At first there were a few songs I didn't know but once I listened a few times came to appreciate them. I never remove this cd from the player in my car!
1451695195|3.0|This book was interesting.  I totally respected the fact that it was written by a Neurosurgeon and not by by a spiritual person, who may have only &#34;imagined&#34; or &#34;hoped&#34; that this is what happened.  From that aspect, I believe it to have merit.  However, I was probably expecting a little bit more that what it delivered.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|We all believe our world to be as we see it justifiying the things as they are so we are &#34;comfortable&#34; not taking action for change. This story of courage in the face of violence from those who claimed to love and care for them should cause you to explore your own sense of how the &#34;other&#34; citizen in your town is living with the embalance of power. It should also move you to take action to be more involved in your local government, to at least vote each and every election so the all the citizens shape policy.
1451648537|5.0|I have not read any other books about Steve JOBS, his life and his work, but this book was a &#34;must read&#34; in my opinion.  For a true story, this book was a real page turner and you couldn't help but really feel for both Steve JOBS and somewhat the people who tried to please him.  After reading the book, I had a soft spot in my heart for this genius of a man, although he was a very difficult one.  I was haunted by Steve JOBS for quite a while after reading this book, and wishing that he could still be with us so that he could produce some more of his &#34;magic&#34; in the technology world.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Joss Whedon's Firefly was canceled far too soon. This colorful, deep, entertaining series deserves all the praise it has earned. Special note should be taken of Summer Glau's acting. She is quite convincing as the damaged/gifted River.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A wonderful story of a man lost at sea, his rescue, and how the experience changed his life. A must see movie. I don't want to give too many details, as I might spoil it for someone who wants to watch it.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|I never stopped smiling while reading this book (when not laughing outright) and couldn't help imaging Sheldon Cooper as the main protagonist.<br />This is a tender and insightful understanding of the thought processess of someone who is not neurotypical, but  learns that despite the differences he has beleived would preclude him from emotional attachment, love can be experienced in unexpected ways.

Book was chosen, read book in less than two weeks, which is amazing,since usually takes me two years to finish a book. Loved this book. Better than I imagined. Vivid and precise writing, parts in the arena of the Hunger Games I actually felt as if I was there. Starting second book tonight!

193700788X|3.0|I am not going to give any spoilers here, as I think there are already loads of reviews that have done that. I am not surprised at all by who Sookie ended up with, I think you could see it happening from several books back. But I will say like the others, this book does not seem like Charlaine Harris wrote it all - none if it seemed in her \\"style\\" at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed it but was a bit disappointed.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I downloaded this and thought it was awesome. Unfortunately it won't play after the first time. Every time I try opening the game, after the Marvel logo, it closes back to the Kindle Carousel. No error code or anything.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I rarely make resolutions at the start of a new year, but in 2012 I made the resolution to try and experience new things outside of my normal comfort zone.  One way I decided to do this was to select a few new CDs from artists I had never listened to whenever I went to my local library.  I had heard of the group Shinedown, but was not familiar with their music.  When I saw this CD at the library I borrowed it and was incredibly glad I did.  I rarely purchase CDs anymore.  I usually buy MP3s and only the songs I really like from an album.  Only when I find an album I truly love do I purchase the CD version. That is the case with Amaryllis.  I enjoy the entire album, but my favorite song is I'll Follow You and some other favorites are Bully, Amaryllis and Unity.  I've also checked out some other Shinedown CDs from my local library and have enjoyed those, too.  Thanks to albums like this and a few others I've discovered, I'm looking forward to the next artist I discover at my local library.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|What can I say?  Everyone's opinion on music is subjective.  I thoroughly enjoyed this soundtrack.  I originally borrowed it from my local library and enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchased the actual CD version and not just an MP3 version.  I have not seen the movie (yet) and don't know what context each song is used in during the movie, which I sometimes find can alter my opinion of music.  I was thrilled that this soundtrack was nominated for an Academy Award and disappointed when it didn't win.

0307887448|1.0|I remember telling my sister, I bet I can open this book to any page and find something from the 80's that was name-dropped.  I randomly turned to a page and found two references.  I turned to another page - three references.  I tried it again - two references.  It took three random page turns to find a page that had no references to any product from the 80's.  Half of this book was the writer basically telling us: \\"Hey, remember this cool thing from the 80's?\\".<br /><br />This book looks as though it was written by an enthusiastic high school kid that took all the great things about his favorite toys and movies, and then he ripped them off and put it in his book as an \\"homage\\".  I LITERALLY started to roll my eyes after seeing so many patronizing references to the 80's.  The book is basically a geek fantasy that offers the reader everything they could possibly desire with no real substance.  The main character is awesome at EVERYTHING, which makes none of this book at all believable.  For those who have read it, the Pac-Man scene was just ridiculous.<br /><br />To put it into perspective, I am not a book or a movie snob.  A movie does not necessarily have to challenge my way of thinking for me to enjoy it.  I love smart movies, but I also like well made \\"turn off your brain\\" movies, as well.  If this book were a movie, it would not even qualify as a well made \\"turn off your brain\\" movie.  Though, if it were a movie, it could not realistically be faithful to the novel since they would have to obtain permission from 500 different companies to feature their product in the movie.<br /><br />To put it simply:  If you found Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Date Movie, or Meet the Spartans enjoyable, then this book is right up your alley.<br /><br />I loved the 80's, but I hated this pedestrian novel.  Zero stars.<br /><br />P.S. I don't write many reviews, but I felt compelled to write a review of this book.  I feel as though I had to warn others when a book this well reviewed is actually pretty awful.

B00AB0Z88S|1.0|It took Ang Lee 4 years to make this movie and it was a total waste of time.  Four years ago, Bollywood may have been hot but not by the time it was released.  This movie was not enjoyable in so many ways as the story was not credible and the special effects were a joke.  The dialogue was from a storybook and shallow in content.  Do not waste two hours of your life watching such a bad movie.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I could watch this movie every day and not get sick of it! You really feel the characters' pain and joy. Love it!
B00005LK94|5.0|My four year old's enjoy this movie.  It shows how families can work together and enjoy each other with our wild life.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I really loved the doctor from the 2nd season and whished she would have stayed on longer in the series. She added a dynamic that the series needed. Many have complained that the re-mastering quality of the 2nd season isn't as good as the 1 st season and I agree with that assessment, but don't let that prevent you from buying it. Some scenes in certain episodes had more noise than others but it wasn't prevalent in the whole episode- it wasn't like the whole episode was terrible-  at lease there was sharpness and clarity and that's what is important to me.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|This is a good family movie.  It shows working together and how valued your family is to each of us.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, and in addition it reminded me that alcholism is a terrible disease.  At first I was angry at him and his drinking, but later during his hearing I felt sorry for him.  To be addicted to the point that other human lives do not matter is certainly repulsive, but curable.  I had to look at the flying scenes twice.  The first time it scared me, and the second time I was in awe of all that happened and how it was handled.

B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This was an excellent crime movie set in the days of notorious crime bosses.  I enjoyed this movie very much.  I really liked the idea of presenting postcard scenes as the credits ran.  I usually don't look at the credits when the movie ends, but that caught my eye, in which I watched them in entirety!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very sweet and touching- but real! Great characters, a book my 15 year old recommended!  He was right.  Kept me intrigued and wanting to keep reading.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Horrible Movie with bad streaming from Amazon makes this the worst movie experience so far. I would never recommend this movie.
B00BPXKWGS|3.0|First, let me say that this was my first R.E.M. album bought many years ago and remains one of my favorites. I was REALLY happy to have this remastered deluxe edition. That being said the remaster sounds pretty thin and doesn't sound like it's meant for play on a good sounding CD player. My stereo is awesome and I had to play with my EQ settings. The highs are too brittle, the lows are a touch too high and the bass guitar isn't even out on the forefront. It's like they took the original master and just did a U-curve on a 10-band EQ with it, with the low/high being brought up and the middle section sloping down. Where's the warmth?<br /><br />I give this three stars because I really liked the packaging. I thought the poster and cards were cool and most importantly - THE LIVE DISC! Very cool to have, awesome performance from the guys. Should have been a double live disc though and not had tracks left off to put on the Greensboro EP. That was a mistake.<br /><br />While we're on the subject, how many people went out of thier way to buy that 5 track EP, whether driving to the local record store on Record Store Day or shelling out big bucks on Ebay (like I did)? Guess what, those tracks are now available on iTunes. So essentially we paid all that extra cash and went through all the trouble for a PATCH! Thanks a lot! What's the point of a special record store day release if you're just going to put it on iTunes a month later? That's not very special.<br /><br />Will always love R.E.M., have all of thier albums. I have given them a lot of my money over the years. Buy this for the live disc, do it on iTunes so you can get the EP tracks too and have the whole show (minus the couple cover songs that weren't included).
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I play this to fill in minutes here and there even in the car. It is a great time consumer

B00BYISQTO|5.0|(Reviewed by Connie's son)<br /><br />*This review is largely subjective. Opinions may clash like socks and flip-flops.*<br /><br />\\"For the 12 years we've been making records, we've always been trying to prove something, and avoid being labeled as dad rock, or depressing,\\" Berninger says. \\"We figured out how to fight so much over the years... This time around, we didn't care.\\"<br /><br />Matt Berninger revealed in an article posted by Billboard on May 20, 2013 that the band had been trying to fight a certain label for years. On The National's new album, \\"Trouble Will Find Me,\\" the band has been alleviated of the pressure that was especially prominent during the making of their previous album, \\"High Violet.\\" In addition to having a better time making the music found on their newest album, they've also done much more experimenting. In the end, this album sounds just as good as The National has always sounded, but with a few new tricks up its collective sleeve.<br /><br />...And here comes the ridiculously long track-by-track segment.<br /><br />----SONG 1: \\"I Should Live in Salt\\"<br /><br />Written in [C Major], the song opens the album pleasantly. The song doesn't seem like much to swoon over immediately, but after multiple listens, the track unfurls and shows its structural trickery, instrumental flourishes, and lyrical quality.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: One thing stands out in the track immediately: a tricky extra beat added to the song.  The repeating progression feels like 4/4, 5/4, 4/4, 4/4. However, it isn't to extremely jarring effect, and it's certainly an interesting touch. After enough listens, it becomes very natural feeling and the listener will most likely forget that the extra beat is there (Arcade Fire's \\"Modern Man,\\" anyone?). Sufjan Stevens' synth flourishes add nicely to the song, especially at the end, where those flourishes are key. There's also a moment where a touch of accordian is used to good effect during one of the verses (not profound, but oddly memorable anyway). Perhaps the most memorable part of the song, however, is the booming chorus, which unearths the previously hidden gems of Matt Berninger's vocal range (the result of quitting smoking) and echoes in the listener's head after repeated listens. It lords over the song, like a reigning, and maybe regretful, king.<br /><br />VERDICT: It may not seem like much at a first glance, but the song is hiding a lot of qualities that deserve to be noticed. Those qualities make this song a worthy opener. Watch out for the grandiose, bathos-laden chorus.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"Learn to appreciate the void / You should know me better than that\\"<br />2.) \\"I should leave it alone but you're not right\\"<br />3.) \\"We have different enemies / You should know me better than that\\"<br /><br />----SONG 2: \\"Demons\\"<br /><br />Written in [G Major], the second song is somber (and somewhat sinister sounding) but surprisingly rattling on the first listen and an extremely bold move as the first single. The time signature completely kicks 4/4 in the face, yet once the listener becomes accustomed to it, the numbness of difference subsides and the song reveals its beauties and solidifies its position as one of the most important songs on the album. Also, the lyrics.<br /><br />ANALYSIS:  The listener's brain may be counting in 4/4 on the first listen, but before they know it, they're lost. The song blindsides the listener with 7/4 throughout, challenging their brain to follow along. After several rounds, the song grows on the listener, and the 7/4 time becomes as plain and pleasant as day. The verse chord progressions are mostly [G], [D], [G], [D], but when unexpected [C] and [Am] chords are thrown in the mix, it almost feels like the song has shifted gears, somehow. That simple change-up is arguably the most memorable part of the album, besides its surprisingly effective lyrics. The transition between the second chorus and the bridge does feel a tad strange somehow,even after multiple listens, but it serves well enough. Interesting flourishes in this song include some staccato strings on the bridge and an interesting flute section during the second verse. Arguably, The most memorable part of the song takes place on the second verse where the [C] and [Am] chords are thrown in amidst the [G] and [D] chords and Matt Berninger begins \\"Huddle with them all night long ...\\" It's so simple, but it really, really works.<br /><br />VERDICT: It's definitely not ear candy to begin with, but once the tricky 7/4 begins to feel natural and the lyrics become noticed and memorized, it's a beautiful, high-caliber song and an unexpected single (and unexpected earworm). It's an absolutely essential listen, and all things considered, it may be The National's most daring song ever.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"I can't fight it anymore / I'm going through an awkward phase\\"<br />2.) \\"All my drowning friends can see / Now there is no running from it\\"<br />3.) \\"Huddle with them all night long / The worried talk to God goes on\\"<br />4.) \\"I sincerely tried to love it / Wish that I could rise above it\\"<br />5.) \\"When I walk into a room / I do not light it up / F***\\"<br /><br />----SONG 3: \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\"<br /><br />Written in [F Major], the third song is the second single and is more immediately enjoyable than the previous song on the album. The song is a good listen every time, although it doesn't feel as wholesome as the other songs, in a way. With interesting flourishes and very clever lyrics, this song provides a fast, fun contrast to the previous and following songs (and with fantastic drumming by Bryan Devendorf).<br /><br />ANALYSIS:  There's nothing terribly fancy about the structure here: basic 4/4 time with pleasant chord progressions. Really, the song's strength lies in its flourishes and lyrical prowess. Quick, rapid-fire staccato strings grace the song throughout, giving the song a rather uplifting feel. Additionally, Sufjan Stevens' synths work well on this album, especially near the beginning. The lyrics here are some of the strongest on the album, which is saying quite a lot, taking into account the lyrical strength throughout this album (and The National's previous albums). The title itself might be a reference to Tennessee Williams who choked to death on the cap of a bottle, but the lyrics seem tell a different story, whatever it may be. Somehow, the most memorable part of the song seems to be at the beginning of the outro right after Matt Berninger sings \\"... Or Nevermind\\" at around 3:36. There's something about that part, possibly Bryan Devendorf's intensified drumming, that really sticks.<br /><br />VERDICT: Fast, immediately enjoyable, and maybe more fitting of a single than the previous song on the album, this song adds to the album nicely with sharp lyrics and fantastic flourishes throughout. Not the album's greatest song, but the album definitely wouldn't feel the same without it.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"Tiny bubbles hang above me / It's a sign that someone loves me\\"<br />2.) \\"I have only two emotions / Careful fear and dead devotion\\"<br />3.) \\"I see all the ones I wept for / All the things I had it in for\\"<br />4.) \\"When they ask what do I see / I say a bright white beautiful heaven hangin' over me\\"<br />5.) \\"I need somewhere to be / But I can't get around the river in front of me\\"<br /><br />----SONG 4: \\"Fireproof\\"<br /><br />Written in [G# Minor/Ab Minor], the fourth song and shortest song on the album isn't immediately recognizable as one of the best. When the unbelievably chilling chorus comes, however, it's immediately apparent. With absolutely spot-on, haunting flourishes, some tricky rhythms in the beginning, and fantastic arrangements all around, there's nothing like the two 2 minutes and 58 seconds this song displays.<br /><br />ANALYSIS:  In the song's intro, there's a tricky melody being played on the guitar. It's initially a little confusing tocount out, but once Matt Berninger begins to sing, things begin to align. While the instrumentation at this point is pleasant, a guitar and piano woven together, the real magic happens once the chorus hits: Right after Matt Berninger sings \\"You're fireproof,\\" Sufjan Stevens adds a low, brooding synth that completely changes a song that begins as mellow as water into something that sounds like it's about to catch fire. Lyrically, the song isn't astounding, and decidedly has the least notable lyrics on the album. However, the song is riddled with beautiful, impeccable flourishes that overshadow the lyrics by miles (the string and flute sections that keep the song from circling its prey in the abyss, for example). The most memorable part of the song is, no doubt, Sufjan Stevens' simple addition to the chorus. It's unforgettable.<br /><br />VERDICT: Short but barely sweet, this song is haunting, spellbinding, mellow, and beautiful all at once. Listening to this song feels somewhat like being hunted by sharks in an ocean (at night) or stalked by tigers in a jungle (at night). It's hard to describe, but it's a must listen.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"You're fireproof / Nothing breaks your heart\\"<br />2.) \\"You're a needle in the hay / You're the water at the door / You're a million miles away / Doesn't matter anymore\\"<br /><br />----SONG 5: \\"Sea of Love\\"<br /><br />Written in [C Major](?), the fifth song on the album is very surprising structure-wise, wonderfully bombastic, emotionally charged, and lyrically touching (and clever). The emotional highlight of the album, the song features beautiful flourishes and an overall sound that grows on the listener.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: While the song is in 4/4, it presents a structure that really makes it stand out among the other songs: the songs contains only 5 bar chord progressions and 3 bar chord progressions (rather than the usual 4 bars that most songs have). Despite the complexity, the progressions flow seamlesslyand are nearly unnoticeable. The song goes through numerous phases, increasing and dropping in intensity, ultimately building to an absolutely astonishing finish that is beautiful, powerful, and awe-inspiring. The strong, clever lyrics supplement the song wonderfully, and seem to indicate a sort of uncertain father-son relationship (possibly akin to Harry Chapin's \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\", but this is merely speculation), or possibly a bond between to friends. In this extremely diverse song, the most memorable part of the song is when the ascent to the massive finisher begins with background vocals accompanying Matt Berninger (singing \\"Hey Joe ...\\") at around 2:00. In what feels like a sad, strained song, it provides an odd feeling of consolation, like a warm embrace of sorts. Sufjan Stevens' very sublte synth flourishes also make this part extremely memorable and add a very uplifting feeling, though it may take several listens to notice them. It all comes together wonderfully.<br /><br />VERDICT: A grower, this song carries a bittersweet feel amidst the pounding of drums, the tricky chord progressions, the clever lyrics, and the massive ascent to what feels like a kind of Pyrrhic victory. It's not quite a tear-jerker of a song, but it's ultimately the most emotive, awe-inspiring, and explosive song on the album. Highly recommended.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"If I stay here trouble will find me / If I stay here I'll never leave\\"<br />2.) \\"Joe I'll always think of you / As the kind of child who knew / This was never gonna last / Joe you fell so fast\\"<br />3.) \\"Hey Joe sorry I hurt you but / They say love is a virtue / Don't they?\\"<br />4.) \\"I see you rushing down / Tell me how to reach you / I see you rushing now / What'd Harvard teach you?\\"<br />5.) \\"Can't stay here anymore / We're turning into fiends\\"<br /><br />----SONG 6: \\"Heavenfaced\\"<br /><br />Written in [C Major], the sixth song on the album is slow, fairly somber, and sounds a tad tricky, despite its relatively simple composition and decidedly sad yet hopeful lyrics. It also contains some string flourishes that give the song a unique ending that contrasts (yet mirrors) the power of the previous song.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: The song is in a breezy 3/4 time, but still, it feels oddly tricky at times. It's kind of hard to describe, but after multiple listens, it becomes natural enough. Lyrically, the song has some pretty clever moments and interesting passages worth noting. There's a lonesome feeling to this song that feels oddly akin to... martyrdom. Possibly the end of the world where everyone is waiting to die. It's odd, but the closing lyrics really drive the feeling in. The most memorable part of the song, arguably, is near the end, where inspiring and unexpected string sections help build the song up to a hopeful, though not explosive, ending, right after Berninger sings \\"Because we'll all arrive in heaven alive / we'll all arrive.\\" It feels sort of like a subtle, understated ascent into heaven itself, like martyrdom or death was achieved. It feels cathartic.<br /><br />VERDICT: A pleasant song with some clever string flourishes at the end and some nice lyrics, it's an easy-going listen that sounds like a kind of cleansing from troubles.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"I could walk out, but I won't / In my mind I am in your arms\\"<br />2.) \\"Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love\\"<br />3.) \\"Because we'll all arrive in heaven alive / We'll all arrive\\"<br /><br />----SONG 7: \\"This is the Last Time\\"<br /><br />Written in [C Dorian](?), song seven on the album has a unique, bitter feel to it. The lyrics don't jump out as much as the lyrics on several of the other songs, but the rolling feel of the drums mixed with instantly memorable melodies and arrangements make this song work nicely.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Immediately catchy and a good listen every go-round (the drumming really powers this song through its collected yet stormy feel), the songworks well with its chord progressions, its somber, orchestral qualities, and instantly enjoyable melodies. The lyrics aren't magnificent, but a few select lyrics do catch attention. They seem to indicate a story of failed love between two lovers: the man who wants his woman back despite the troubles, and the woman who doesn't reciprocate his feelings (The man seems to eventually give up in the end). The feeling of the song is very bitter and romantically miserable. The most memorable part of the song is when Annie Clark (aka St. Vincent) provides background vocals in the outro (\\"It takes a lot of rain in the cup ...\\"). The whole outro is supplemented with orchestral arrangements that seem to drown in wine, tears, and regrets, but when Annie joins in for the frictional duet, it feels like the female personality has revealed herself... and still doesn't want the male lover back. It's a sad situation amidst the beautiful arrangements.<br /><br />VERDICT: The drumming carries this song through nicely, accompanied by its subtle chamber arrangements and fair lyrics that paint a picture of a miserable duo who just couldn't make their ends meet in the end. A good addition to the album.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"Oh, but your love is such a swamp / You don't think before you jump / And I said I wouldn't get sucked in\\"<br />2.) \\"Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here / I got Tylenol and beer\\"<br />3.) \\"We were so under the brine / We were so vacant and kind\\"<br />4.) \\"Baby you gave me bad ideas / Baby you left me sad and high\\"<br /><br />----SONG 8: \\"Graceless\\"<br /><br />Written in [E Major], song eight and a fan favorite possesses strong lyrics, unrelenting force, fantastic composition and flourishes, and a fast tempo. A wildly fun listen every time, this song builds to a bombastic finale and again displays Matt Berninger's widened vocal range, just like on the first song. This song is an immediate highlight.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Granted, the National have done a lotof experimentation on this album, especially with time signatures, but this song is in a basic 4/4 with simple-but-fitting chord progressions. The way it's delivered is exceptional. The song is fast, pummeling, uplifting, and laden with fantastic and funny lyrics that seem to tell a story of a miserable or addicted man (or a man who became miserable after losing his woman and turned to medication, maybe). Beneath the party of speed and uplifting chords and melodies is Bryan Devendorf's drumming at its most vicious. The most memorable part of the song starts at around 2:11 where Berninger begins to sign \\"All my thoughts of you ...\\" (Bryan Devendorfs repeated snare hits lead up to the part which really add). The loudest or most grandiose moments of a song aren't necessarily the ones that stick the most, and that simple change-up, which in itself is barely a change-up, gives an oddly dynamic effect to the song that adds a lot to the sound.<br /><br />VERDICT: Loud, fast, ridiculously fun, heavy with wicked drumming, and with miserable and funny lyrics, this song is an explosive addition to the album. This one is worth putting on repeat.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"Graceless / Is there a powder to erase this? / Is it dissolvable and tasteless? / You can't imagine how I hate this / Graceless\\"<br />2.) \\"There's a science to walking through windows\\"<br />3.) \\"All of my thoughts of you / Bullets through rotten fruit / Come apart at the seams / Now I know what dying means\\"<br />4.) \\"I am not my rosy self / Left my roses on my shelf / Take the white ones, they're my favorites / It's the side effects that save us\\"<br />5.) Grace / Put the flowers you find in a vase / If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place / Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste / Grace<br /><br />----SONG 9: \\"Slipped\\"<br /><br />Written in [E Major], the ninth song has an easygoing, very melancholy sound, decidedly reminiscent of one of the National's earlier songs, \\"Runaway.\\" While lyrics aren't too bad and the instrumentation pretty nice, the song hides a secret: it is one of, if not the, most complex songs on the album. Pay attention to those time signatures.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Slow and steady, its swing feel compliments its instrumentation. The song is paired with some nice lyrics, although the album contains stronger ones (Whatever story is being told through them doesn't seem to point to anything terribly positive). The simplicity of it all masks the underlying complexity of the song itself, where time signatures blend together so seamlessly, it's downright brilliant. The song is mostly in 7/4, but for a few bars it switches to 4/4, THEN to a few bars of 6/4... and then brains are fried.  There may be other time signatures as well, but wherever they are, if they are, they're unbelievably well disguised. Amidst the mastery of time signature smoke and mirrors, the most memorable part of the song is around 3:25 where things begin to swell as Matt Berninger begins \\"I keep coming back here ...\\" for the final time. Admittedly, the song doesn't contain many memorable moments, but here it feels like the ascent of the hill is over and all that's left to do is overlook the stretch of land and feel the wind blow.<br /><br />VERDICT: This song, on one hand, isn't much to appreciate to begin with. On the other hand, it may be the song worth most of the listener's appreciation.  Despite fair lyrics and simple instrumentation, everything works on a level that is greater than it seems. This song deserves attention.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"I'm in the city you hated / My eyes are falling / Counting the clicks with the living dead / My eyes are red\\"<br />2.) \\"I'm having trouble inside my skin / I'll try to keep my skeletons in\\"<br />3.) \\"But I'll never be / Anything you ever want me to be\\"<br />4.) \\"I keep coming back here where everything... slipped\\"<br /><br />----SONG 10: \\"I Need My Girl\\"<br /><br />Written in [D#/Eb Major], the tenth song has very somber, somewhat haunting, single-worthy feel to it. The composition is in a slow and steady 4/4 time with sparse yet memorable instrumentation and some pretty flourishes throughout. The lyrics aren't terribly strong. However, they do feel somewhat akin to a comedy-drama.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: The song's structure and composition really make it feel like it could serve as a single. In a slow, simple 4/4, the cold, midnight rain shower song is filled with instantly memorable melodies and flourishes that bring about a very solemn feeling, despite the major key the song is written in. Amidst the pretty guitars, Sufjan Stevens' synths, and all the orchestrations is a collection of lyrics that, while not fantastic, are humorous, strange, and sad. They seem to tell a story of a man who can't be anywhere without his girl... and he's somewhere without his girl. Possibly. In a song that seems to drown in misery, the most memorable part of the song is the outro, where Sufjan Stevens' fantastic synths feel like one final, conclusive gust of wind from a cold front. It's absolutely chilling and it lingers long after the song is over. The littlest of flourishes can make a song, and this is one of them.<br /><br />VERDICT: Perhaps not the most exciting song on the album, it works well with its position on the album and is still a good listen. The ending can send chills down the listener's spine, and is the definitive moment of the song. For lovers of sad or bittersweet music, this one's a winner.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"I am good, I am grounded / Davy says that I look taller / But I can't get my head around it / I keep feeling smaller and smaller\\"<br />2.) \\"Remember when you lost your s*** and / Drove the car into the garden\\"<br />3.) \\"There's some things that I should never / Laugh about in front of family\\"<br /><br />----SONG 11: \\"Humiliation\\"<br /><br />Written in [A#/Bb Major](?), the eleventh and longest song transitions seamlessly from the somber tenth song and provides uplifting acceleration. The lyrics are decidedly the most humorous on the album, and along with some great chord and key changes (and a fantastic, bluesy ending), this song is a melancholy (yet somewhat carefree) tour-de-force that really surprises... and really sticks.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Like the third and eighth songs, this song is in 4/4. And fast. Bryan Devendorf's drumming isn't complex here, but it drives the song along, again, like songs three and eight. Above the rolling drums, piano chords and a synth pad provided by Sufjan Steven intertwine to fill the song with a very uplifting and fresh air (like a non-headache inducing mixture of perfume and cologne). It's worth noting that this song introduces brief but very interesting key changes beginning at around 1:58. The song does have some funny lyrics, and whatever story is being conveyed through them is delivered à la dark humor, and it works well. The most memorable part of the song is also the most surprising part of the song: the bluesy ending, beginning with the notes D#, E, F, G being played on the guitar, and Matt Berninger seemingly singing about a woman who decided that she just wants to have a good time (\\"She wore blue velvet ...\\"). That part sticks from the first listen on. It's completely unexpected, but it completely works. It's the part that the listener waits for every time.<br /><br />VERDICT: A definite go-to song, it's fast, simple, beautiful, funny, and wonderfully arranged with some interesting chord progressions and key changes throughout. However, the ending completely makes the song what it is: fun and addictive. This song is definitely worth a listen. Or two. Or twenty.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"I survived the dinner / And the air went thinner\\"<br />2.) \\"If I die this instant / Taken from a distance / They will probably list it down / Among other things round town\\"<br />3.) \\"In the skies over black Venice / I see eyes of a white menace\\"<br />4.)\\"All the L.A. women / Fall asleep while swimming / I got paid to fish 'em out / And then one day I lost the job<br />5.) \\"Tunnel vision lights my way / Leave a little life today\\"<br />6.) \\"Under the withering white skies of humiliation\\"<br />7.) \\"She wore blue velvet / Said she can't help it\\"<br /><br />----SONG 12: \\"Pink Rabbits\\"<br /><br />Written in [A Major], the penultimate song on the album displays the best lyrics on the entire album, no questions asked. Its lyrics paired with its simple composition give the song a curiously magical feeling that's hard to describe. This song is also the album's weed: it grows much faster than expected.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Compositionally, the song is simple and pretty enough in a pinch. It's in an easy, swung 4/4 time with a very unassuming chord progression, but it wouldn't be able to stand on its own. And it doesn't: the lyrics on this song are really the best of the thirteen songs. Once heard and remembered, the lyrics completely change the feeling of the song and instill a feeling of magic mixed with sadness. The lyrics seem to tell a bittersweet story of two off-kilter lovers (or ex-lovers who long to return to each other, maybe). Whatever the song is about, it feels akin to opposing magnetic fields in love, and it sounds absolutely wonderful. The most memorable part of the song is, again, the outro. At around 3:30 is when Matt reiterates the final lyrics of the song (\\"You said it would be painless ...\\"), accompanied by celeste notes that are really the icing on the cake. The sound is unified, nostalgic, awe-inspiring, incredible.<br /><br />VERDICT: A big surprise on the album, this song's stunning and adventurous lyrics coaxes the simple arrangements its married to out of its humble state to fly together over incredible distances and above mountainous peaks. It only gets better after each listen, and it definitely deserves the listener's attention. It also deserves to be called one of the best songs on the album.<br/><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea / I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me\\"<br />2.) \\"I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now / I was just getting used to living life without you around / I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now / You always said I held you way too high off the ground\\"<br />3.) \\"You didn't see me I was falling apart / I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park / You didn't see me I was falling apart / I was a television version of a person with a broken heart\\"<br />4.) \\"You said it would be painless / A needle in a doll / You said it would be painless / It wasn't that at all\\"<br />5.) \\"Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd / I didn't understand then / I don't understand now<br /><br />----SONG 13: \\"Hard to Find\\"<br /><br />Written in [G# Major], the closing song on the album ends the collection very solemnly and beautifully. This song has fairly nice lyrics, and like most National songs, it's a bit of a grower. This song is also the final testament that, yes, the National have done more experimenting with music than usual this time around.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: One thing isn't immediately apparent about the song: it isn't in 4/4 time. Rather, it's seamlessly composed in 5/4 time, aided by the easygoing feel throughout the song. The composition is so smooth that there's little or nothing to \\"get used to,\\" in a sense, with this time signature. Though the lyrics themselves aren't terribly stunning, there are some clever moments throughout, and even a reference to the Violent Femmes. The most memorable part of the song is, like many of the others, the outro. Beginning around 3:09, the band introduces a more present drumming pattern and a beautiful, regal brass section that sounds like a memorial to a dead, beloved king. It's subtle, yet somewhat breathtaking and bittersweet.<br /><br />VERDICT: Not immediately loveable, but after a few listens, the song reveals the qualities of its composition and overall sound. A very beautiful, mellow way to end a stunning album.<br /><br />STAND-OUT LYRICS:<br />1.) \\"They can all / Just kiss off into the air\\"<br />2.) \\"Don't know why we had to lose / The ones who took so little space / We're still waiting for the ease / To cover what we can't erase\\"<br />3.) \\"I'm not holding out for you / But I'm still watching for the signs / If I tried you'd probably be / Hard to find\\"<br /><br />In the end, no song is really a let down. Though some are definitively better than others, Each song contains things worth appreciating, whether they be tiny flourishes, fast tempos, slow tempos, fantastic lyrics, mind-frying time signatures, key changes, ideal chord progressions, or the like. The National may have traded their stress levels for wild, hidden-in-plain-sight ideas and there doesn't seem to be a real misstep. Even though some songs work really well enough alone, everything works together wonderfully in the long run. Here's to another fantastic album by The National.<br /><br />Personal favorite song: \\"Humiliation\\"

It also had a sweet story and I didn't want it to end. I cannot wait for more books in this series. It very much reminded me of Tara Sivec's &#34;Chocolate Lovers Series.&#34;

193700788X|4.0|I won't give away who Sookie ends up with, but in my opinion it is the right and believable choice. People have been watching too much TB and have that confused with the spirit of the books, and that's all I'll say. Sookie appears to have the need to move on to the next chapter of her life, and this and the last novel set up what type of life she means to have beyond the end of these novels. I would wish for a few more details in these good byes, but I'll definitely be buying Ms. Harris's future books.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This was the best Bond ever..Daniel Craig was excellent in this very fast paced film. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.

0439023513|5.0|If you enjoyed the ending of book 2 then i dont no how the actions of Katniss and the plot was any surprise. As far as the ending go i think people are missing the key point of the story. It's about war if you think soldiers in war come home smiling and having fun and not having long term effects then you just don't realize what these people deal with. Not to mention the two main characters are teenagers. This is what Ms. Collins wanted to show, so I had no problem with the way Katniss character was portrayed in the end. As far as some the other characters you came to love its war their here one minute and they can die at any second in battle that's reality. My only issue with the ending was with Katniss and Snow finally coming face to face it was short and not how you  think their last meeting would go. I guess her sister death left her so distraught she didn't care anymore but then again being she thought it was Snow that caused it you think she would react differently since she is facing the man at the time her sister's killer including everything else Snow has done overall and personally to Katniss. Could there have been an extra chapter to give more detail with the other surviving characters in the ending a little more sure. But looking big picture your dealing with two wounded soldiers dealing with getting back to normal life and finding ways to deal with what they witness and have done. My recommendation is its a must read not once but twice understand the authors mindset and you'll love the book. I can't wait to see it come to life on screen in the future.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Interesting for factual content, but little development of Tesla, cohorts or relationships.  Lacked the detail that one looks for when such a complex and important subject is being analyzed.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good graphics and good puzzles lots of cool sounds. Grewt game for people wanting a challenge. Love the mystery of the game.
B0051OZ564|4.0|I was surprised by this movie, finding it quite enjoyable. I rented it, fearing the worst after reading the reviews. It's an example of how different we all are in what we like. I thought it offered some nifty special effects and fighting scenes, a curious storyline, and more than a few excellent quotes from the Wise Man. Oh, and since I like girls a whole lot, looking at the gals was okay, too.<br /><br />Completely worth a rent. Try not to take it too seriously and you'll be fine. \\"For those who fight for it, life has a  flavor the sheltered will never know.\\"

0425263908|1.0|I gave this one star ONLY cuz it taking so long to get it. This is a book of three and I ordered two of the books at the same time from different companies and I received the second book within three days of ordering and a month plus I am still waiting the the first book, so I can't read theses books until I receive the first. Grrr
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read a review of a movie once that described the film as sweet and terrifying. These two words do not usually pair up so I was intrigued.  Although these books were not terrifying, they had their moments with the control freak, creepy boss, and kidnapping.  The books surprised me with the love story.  Overall I would rate these books with five stars.  I could not stop reading.
0425263916|5.0|I ordered this book late at night and I received the book in three day great service. I loved how it was vac packed and the book looked brand new. I will order from this company again. This book is from a series and they didn't have the first book so I had to order it from other company I am still waiting after a month.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It took a bit to get into the first book. A lot of family history and names and whatnot. But once into the meat of the story, I was HOOKED. I highly recommend this series to everyone I know..even the squeamish...excellent story!
0345803507|3.0|I expected the third book to be much better than the second. It did have it's good moments but towards the end it got dry and quite boring. Yes, there were plenty of steamy scenes but at times the story line appeared skewed.

B000001ELL|5.0|On every KISS album up to and including \\"DYNASTY\\", the fan knew before ever even giving it a listen, that they, again, were \\"witnessing\\" in what direction rock and roll music was heading! I think that with \\"DYNASTY\\" it was obvious that the band had done some \\"growing up.\\" It (DYNASTY) contained some of the bands best work of all-time. \\"Charisma\\" was a very catchy hard hitting rocker. \\"Sure Know Something\\" was KISS at it's possibly very best. My favorite cut from DYNASTY was \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" which also coined a new phrase that basically everyone was using at the time \\"KISSCO\\". It didn't matter what people wanted to call it, because it was hot, fresh and showed that KISS was a multi-talented band that had diversity to do just about everything, and do it well. Casey Kasum would count all the way up to #11 before this \\"monster hit\\" would slow down, and yes, it did get some \\"spins\\" in American Disco's (which were hotter than even KISS at this time) with it's 12 inch club version peaking at #37 on that chart! \\"Dynasty\\" brought KISS' dependable and sucessful rock and roll formula to a grinding halt, due to the fact that in the very next year, 1980, they follow up with a very \\"uneven\\" UNMASKED, their road has been \\"bumpy\\" (at best) ever since...
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|No matter how three-dimensional and complex our beloved pony friends are, there is only so much they can do, since MLP IS a kids show. As such, we don't really get a chance to see what the Mane Six would do or how they would behave in more adult situations. However, all bets are of in this film as we follow our heroines on their journey as they fight for friendship and the burdens it brings. A bittersweet tale of harmony and chaos, justice and corruption, integrity and deception, love and betrayal, this film will not only leave you begging for more, in the end it will make you ask yourself, \\"Who are my friends?Where are they?\\"<br /><br />But who am I to judge? Take a sneak-peak of one of the scenes from the film and let it speak for itself.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Rarity rested her gun, barrel pointing directly at Rainbow's chin<br /><br />Rarity: \\"Ever read The Astral Prophesies, Rainbow?\\"<br /><br />Rainbow: \\"Not regularly, no.\\"<br /><br />Rarity: \\"Well there's a passage that really captured my imagination. Starswirl 25:17. 'The path of the righteous mare is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish, and the tyranny of evil mares. Blessed is she who, in the name of harmony and friendship, shepherds the weak through the Longest Night. For she is truly her sisters friend, and the finder of wayward fillies.<br /><br />And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger, those who would attempt to poison and destroy my sisters, and you will know my name is Celestia, when I shine my justice upon you.'<br /><br />I've been mulling over those words for years, and if you ever heard it, why, a Lady would not describe what might occur. But its true meaning ever eluded me. It certainly served as a rather dramatic twist to an otherwise, and perhaps undeservedly, pragmatic and straightforward situation. But there were... events, this morning, which gave me pause for thought.<br />It could mean that you're the mean old mare, and I the righteous filly. Tom, here, he's the shepherd gallantly defending my righteous derriere through my own Longest Night. Or it could mean that you're the righteous mare, and I'm the shepherd, and all of Equestria is evil and selfish.<br /><br />I'd like that, but it just doesn't ring true. The truth is Dashie, that you're the weak, and I'm the tyranny and sighs selfishness. But I'm trying. I'm trying to be the shepherd.\\"<br /><br />Rarity lowered the gun to the table between them. Never breaking Rainbow's gaze, though a stinging tear made its ugly way down her white cheek.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I've recommended this to everyone, including all the lawyers I know.  Great plot and dialogue.  The book leads to the question of how far any parent would go to protect their children.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Excellent read. Exciting and it does not take 20 pages of boring reading to get into the story. I enjoyed it
1476715904|5.0|Very touching and moving story about loss, love and finding friendships. Yes, there is a strong romantic element to the story and the build up of not being able to be with one another. But there are heartfelt scenes of friendship and family. Being there for one another with honesty and trust. Every characters is so well developed and major players in the story even if some are &#34;secondary&#34; characters. Loved the slam poetry and references to music-The Avett Brothers. Clever, smart, fun and romantic. Ready for book 2!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am not prone to watch TV shows of this sort as I tend to stick with History channel, Natgeo and the like.  But this show is terrific.  My wife and I have worked through the series and will be lost until the new season comes out.  The acting is superb.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor and Park are two very well written and likable high school kids. But this story is not just for teens. Set in the 80s, there are many wonderful fashion/music/culture references to appreciate that time. There are some themes that are unsettling but it is handled with such honesty, humor and care. A Romeo and Juliet like story without the heartbreaking ending.

It made the experience more intimate.<br />He's never been into monogamy.<br />Makes it a rule to never sleep with a woman more than once and they're never brought to his apartment.<br />Until Kate Brooks comes into his life.<br />The chemistry between the two is undeniable.<br />She's the first woman who doesn't succumb to his charms instantly.<br />The back and forth between the two made for some wonderful angst.<br />The secondary characters are also wonderful<br />You'll especially fall for Drew's little niece Mackenzie and her curse word jar!!!<br />Emma Chase you've made me into a fan!<br />The fact that this is her debut book is pretty phenomenal.<br />Do yourselves a favor and buy this book and read it right away!!!!!!
B0050PYNO4|3.0|PROS: This is a pretty good fantasy / escapism movie... I'll watch it more than once.<br /><br />CONS: The problem is that everyone of my family and friends think this movie (( HAD )) great potential to be a five star movie...but it kept slipping up along the way...!!!<br /><br />Too bad...a little more creativity and a lot less political correctness and stereotyping along with lots of mundane Silliness and the oh so typical Hollywood Left-Wing-Anti-Christianity ...Pro-Science clap-trap stance is such a terrible waste of money and effort.... tsk tsk tsk...too bad!!!!  ))<br /><br />Well guys, maybe next time some one will get it right!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I found it to be a nice read. You could just imagine what she was seeing and feeling.  A little predictable but still enjoyable.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I had no interest in this film when it came out in theaters. It looked like a Band Slam/Glee rip-off and I'm not big on romantic comedies as a rule. But every now and then, one stands out from the rest and this one did in aa lot of ways.<br /><br />For starters, there's a lot of talent here. Every one of the main performers can sing, even the hilarious Rebel Wilson, who's chops are best when she's NOT going over the top with it. Anna Kendrick really knocked it out of the park, though. There's an unusual quality to her voice and her phrasing at times is a bit of a throw-back to pre-rock and roll 30's and 40's vocalists, even when singing current fare like 'Titanium'. And it works. It's a great foil to Brittany Snow's lovely but almost too-sweet voice.<br /><br />Though the plot is predictable, the gags, jokes and dialogue are fresh enough to be entertaining. Except the vomit. Too much vomit. In fact, it loses a star soley because the 'Vomit Angel' almost made me puke.<br /><br />I had some good laughs at the whispered one-liners of Hanna Mae-I urge you to either turn up the volume and listen close or turn on the subtitles when she speaks. If you don't, you miss some of the most off-the-wall comments in the movie.

0316187216|4.0|\\"Where I come from we got a different way of doing things.\\"<br /><br />- Lamb<br /><br />I think what separates Joe Abercrombie's characters from so many others we see in fantasy fiction (and real life, for that matter) is the incredible self awareness each character possesses, from the primary protagonists all the way down to the lowliest henchman. Abercrombie's greatest strength is creating these world-weary characters who just don't have the energy to sugarcoat things any more, and this unflinching honesty not only extends to the world and the people that surround them, but to their own faults and inadequacies.<br /><br />In RED COUNTRY, Abercrombie actually introduces two characters that, with the possible exception of the Dogman from previous novels, seem the least likely to engage in sociopathic tendencies. Shy South, a woman whose younger brother and sister have been kidnapped, has a past that includes theft and murder, but those days seem to be in her past. As we get to know her during the events covered in the novel, she's capable, but she's often shocked by the violence of her compatriots and the wasteful deaths that plague her rescue efforts.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Temple, a self-professed coward who admits to taking the easy way out whenever it's available, actually isn't that bad a person. He's cowardly, but his heart's generally in the right place. That makes him a tremendous deviation from many of the other characters Abercrombie has introduced us to over the years, especially the apparent good guys that often prove just as bad as their adversaries.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't find Shy and Temple to be as interesting as some of the other, less sane characters from previous Abercrombie novels. Fortunately, many of my favorite sociopaths return, including Caul Shivers, Friendly (possibly my favorite character in the Abercrombie-verse), Nicomo Cosca and Lamb, a nine-fingered Northman who's new name certainly won't fool readers who have read Abercrombie's previous works -- though interestingly enough, the character's real name is never actually mentioned.<br /><br />The fantasy western conceit works well with Abercrombie's strengths of playing with common tropes and utilizing the aforementioned world-weary characters. (Perhaps I like my characters slightly insane.) The plot moves a bit slowly and I didn't find these characters as gripping as I have in Abercrombie's previous books, but the POV characters' voices still provide the story with a sturdy backbone that makes it better than most everything else out there.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I thought this film succeeded on all levels. Very suspenseful at times, top notch acting, lots of drama and flawless special effects. I can't say that about the last few efforts of Denzel, I have been a fan of his since \\"Glory,\\" but to me, this was a big come back for him.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I have read all of Le Carre's books and, until his most recent efforts, I would never have imagined myself giving anything he wrote less than 5 stars.  Unfortunately his last few works, including this one, have pushed me in that previously unimagined direction.  I think his greatest skill was to take readers unfamiliar with a murky world to a level of appreciation of subtleties and nuances they would never have achieved without him.  While he still possesses exceptional writing skills, he no longer seems to be able to take a reader to that transcendent level.  The nuance and subtlety has been replaced with a smack in the face with a rolled up newspaper.  It seems like he is writing the script for a mediocre \\"made for tv\\" movie based on a \\"true story.\\"  I will probably continue to read his future works in the hope that he will reverse this trend, but this book was a very unsatisfying one.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Right up there with some of my favorite lawyer television - The Good Wife, The Guardian, etc.  It's intelligent and I find myself caring about the characters.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Believe it. Drive is the best film to come along in a very long time. Not since Pulp Fiction has there been a more passionate love letter to the Cinema. Drive is one of my favorite movies of the millennium era and it gives me hope... Cinema may not be completely dead after all.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling stars as the Driver in yet another performance that has helped to cement him as one of Hollywood's top actors. Nicolas Winding Refn directs him with ease. With Drive, Refn has proven himself as one the premier directors of his generation. Drive, along with his previous films like Bronson and the Pusher trilogy, is not necessarily a reinvention of modern cinema, but more or less a reinterpretation of the days of Cinema past. Refn is startlingly good, so good I get goosebumps just from watching his scenes take time and build up. Finally the likes of Scorsese and Cronenberg can take it easy, and Tarantino and the Coens can step aside to make way for the next great talent in film direction: Nicolas Winding Refn.<br /><br />Drive takes its lead from, quite possibly, the coolest film ever made. Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 magnum opus Le Samourai.<br /><br />Refn's creation, the character of the Driver, is cut straight from the same cloth as Le Samourai's Jef Costello. The characters share several likenesses, the least important of which being a mysterious and sordid past. The most important likeness being the almost ritualistic way both men carry out the tasks assigned to them, the lonely lives in which they traverse through a disconnected and oblivious habitat, the trust that doesn't come easy but when it does it is given to a pretty girl who seals both of their fates, and most interestingly, the eyes. Ryan Gosling must have studied Alain Delon's performance as they both seem to communicate most of the plot-points with their eyes and only their eyes. A subtle physicality that is unbelievably difficult to perpetuate freely comes naturally to the tortured stare found in bothDelon and Gosling. The Driver's real name could easily have been Jef Costello as far as I'm concerned. This is also telling of how many different ways the same film can be so influential to extremely different ends. This polarity is best explored by Drive and John Woo's 1989 The Killer. Both films are flamboyantly open about the debt each owes to the influence of Le Samourai. Where Drive is almost an arthouse action film, the Killer is the exact opposite of that. But its influence on both films is unmistakable, Le Samourai wrote the book, and Refn has memorized each and every passage. Yes, it doesn't just stop with Gosling's performance, Drive owes a great deal to Le Samourai in almost every single department. The pacing Refn embraces is classic Melville, the way he tells the story is almost formulaic of a Melville crime picture. Drive, in essence, is an American action film with 60s French sensibilities. People may seem to give Drive too much credit in the originality department, where much of the credit is Melville-deserved. But I don't hold anything against Drive for being almost a reinterpretation Le Samourai. I see Drive for what it was always meant to be, the warmest and most sincere thank you letter to classic Cinema ever filmed. Refn does no hiding when it comes to the Melville influence, its there staring you proudly in the face. Bravo, Drive, Bravo! Melville would be proud.<br /><br />What is most unique about Drive is the fact that the film is just as much a salute to the French New Wave of the sixties as it is a reimagining of the mainstream American cinema of the eighties. Surprisingly enough, in a film that boasts a very large and formidable Arthouse following, 1986's Cobra, 1985's To Live And Die In L.A., and several other nods to 80s cinema is almost interchangeable with the 60s influence. Where the 60s influence may be more subtle and, inherently, much more consistent throughout, the 80s influence is mostly on the surface. The 80s influence in Driveis of the strictly superficial variety, which is both faithful and respectful of the 80s films and techniques certain areas of the film are modeled after. Neon pink title cards, synthesizer soundtrack, mood changes, the poster art, and the occasional trademark 80s lighting. Although a caricature like Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti can in fact be found on the surface of the character of the Driver, that is only the surface, it is not the actual substance of the character. The substance of the character is Le Samourai's Jef Costello. Its almost as if the movie's true colors are of the Melville variety, but it masquerades itself as something much more accessible. Drive pretends to be an 80s American action film. But Drive is so much than that, as any semi-educated cinefile will tell you, Drive is film that wears several different masks. Its true identity is that of Melville. And I can't think of a better frame of mind than that.<br /><br />Cast-wise, yes, Albert Brooks steals the show. The character Brooks plays is also one of the only non-french influences on the film. Bernie Ross is wholly American, and that is why he is such a vicious character. Bernie Ross is an 80s action villain and he is pitted against a 60s character study. The clash is almost inevitable but the mutual respect contained therein is the most rewarding aspect of their relationship. Much the same can be said about fans of the Arthouse and of the Mainstream. There is a mutual respect there, although all too often these sects of film fans and filmmakers will clash, they are nothing without the other. That said, in theory, the rift between Bernie Ross and the Driver can be symbolic of several different things: Mainstream vs Arthouse, Excess vs Conservation, Action vs Meditation, European sensibilities vs American know-how, but most daringly it represents the Death Of Modern Cinema. All the greats are killing each other off. Film cannot survive in a climate of servitude to the past. Mainstream wounds the Arthouse, the Arthouse fights back. Both the Mainstream and the Arthouse refuse to let go of their history, therefore they are doomed to tell the same stories over and over again, and cut the other's throat when necessary. The current state of filmmaking is in a very sad state of affairs as of late, Drive is a film that pits over-used caricatures, genres, and eras, popular of modern visual storytelling, against each other, until once everything is done, destroyed, and wounded. All you are left with is the end credits and the promise of a stripped down and re-imagined future of filmmaking.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Delicious - all three books! Loved them so much I want to read them again.  Ana is a very lucky girl!!
B009AMANH4|1.0|This will be a very brief review. Steven Spielberg was obviously Oscar-hungry during the production of Lincoln. This film is a horribly wasted opportunity to shed light on one of America's most interesting presidents in one of America's most turbulent of times. Instead of showcasing something honest, gripping, or even titillating, Spielberg uses this time to cater to the already initiated ranks of the most rigidly corrupt brotherhood in all of art, The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences. I'm not sure if Spielberg ever had a brave bone in his body, but after watching Lincoln, I wonder if he even has a soul. Lincoln is a soulless film. It is very difficult to make a film that deals with all of the interesting historical events that Lincoln is centered around boring, but Spielberg seems to do that effortlessly. What's more, Daniel Day Lewis churns out a boring and half-hearted performance, as do most of the actors in the piece! Its as if Lincoln was made by a half-interested company for a built in audience that were completely uninterested in fanciful concepts like intimacy, empathy, and courage.<br /><br />Lincoln is not a film, it is an instructional video for all future hack-job directors on how to make a movie about something as multi-faceted as the presidency of Abraham Lincoln seem watered-down, hokey, and as accessible to as many people as possible. Ken Burns should have been an adviser on the film in some capacity, as he seems to know a thing or two about intimacy and courage. Spielberg never tried to give us anything more than the bare minimum the Academy required of him. He didn't even try to give us one actually fleshed out and interesting character. I know he can take a historical event and present it in a brave and intimate way, how Spielberg treated Schindler's List is a great example of what I'm talking about. Spielberg made a brave film then, not just something the Academy wanted, but something that he wanted. He didn't even try to that with Lincoln, he didn't even try...

B00C061I3K|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk. Discovery was an incredible album, and I have been patiently waiting for nearly 8 years for Random Access Memories. When I heard the first single, Get Lucky, I was a bit optimistic. It sounded pretty great aside from the inclusion of Pharrell Williams (Why?). So when the album was released, I listened to it in full. While there are 2-3 good tracks, the majority of these songs are garbage. Simple as that. The narration and monologues get in the way of the music itself (the music should be able to speak FOR them), they tainted the music by including other artists, etc. I don't mind the 70s and 80s style; I think it was a good musical direction for them. Overall though, this album just isn't that good compared to the rest of their stuff. It may be catchy, but music is much more than that; at least that's how I see it.
0679805273|5.0|This is a book that I will have the teacher for kindergarten through 12th grade record a message about my grandson each year. The pages of this book will document his education.  I plan to include his school photo as well.  The teacher will write on the book pages .  Upon HS graduation I will present this to him  ...don't want to wish my life away but I can't wait.  The book is perfect.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book reminded me of adventures I'd always imagined when I was a kid. It took me back to a great memories from my childhood. When I first started this book I couldn't tell if it was for young people or adults but it doesn't really matter because this can be enjoyed by the young or old.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great sharpener, very fairly priced and portable enough for taking camping.  I just tried it out and am very happy with the results.  BUY IT!  4/22/17.  I'm buying a second one to give as a gift, I like this sharpener that much!  Just tried out one made by another well known company and was very disappointed. It was pathetic..  The Smith's beats 'em all.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|When I say dark, I literally mean all the action happens in the shadows which blends in too much with the mood lighting of the movie. I rented from Amazon and watched on XBox, I had to turn the brightness up to about 60 to see anything, and it didn't help. Was annoyed through most of the movie, wondering what they saw in the shadows I couldn't see.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, falls in line with other lame-ass horror movies of late, plodding through dumb backstory and delivering cheap thrills, no climax, and absurd ending. Expected more from Jessica Chastain, she could easily have been given the Oscar for Zero Dark Thirty. She wasn't stretching much to play the lamest riot grrrl since Courtney Love stopped doing heroin the first time.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13, even though Amazon had it listed as R.  Swearing blood and nudity wouldn't have made it any better, but at least made it more watchable.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|A great book especially for school age young women.  A romance that is not gratuitous and stays with you as what love can be.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is an excellent period piece that depicts the lives of both the nobility and the servant class of England during the early 19th century. The characters are riveting and the actors give excellent performances. Maggie Smith is perfect as the Countess Dowager. Give it a chance, and I promise you'll love it!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This outstanding book and I highly suggest that you incourage all your children (high school) to read it.  Our boys deem this as a favorite and have re-read it as they grew older, still enjoying it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had this game for a long time and its awesome. There is no game better then this game in the world. If you are not sure that you will like this game, (your cookoo if you don't  ;) ) buy the demo first. I think it could be better though if you could actually CRAFT. That kind of the hole point of survival. And if it had wonderment slims and the nether or ather. (If you have seen the mod) and I can't want for 0.7.0!!!!!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Loved this book.  The movie was so incomplete I hope people will read this book to learn so much about Lincoln that we haven't seen before.
B00C2C637I|5.0|I loved this book. The story is so dark! Bradbury takes something so commonplace as a traveling carnival and makes it sinister. The evil carnies were so very scary!
B00C061I3K|2.0|It seems as though a lot of people love this album just because its Daft Punk.  If it was any other artist it would hardly be talked about.  It is average music at best.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|This started a little slow but once it got going it was hard to put down , a very good quick read.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Compared to other Music Videos I have seen this one does a great job delving into the ups and downs of song writing. We can't always conjure up a song. Songs like &#34;Life in the fast lane&#34;. when this inspiration occurred it almost cost one of the members lives. It doesn't say that but you can listen to the song afterwards and think &#34;WOW&#34;. The way the movie covers the decades is well documented and what more can I say except the only lyrics they missed out on was &#34;Fly Like an Eagle&#34; and then they would have been Gods indeed.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This was perfect for the game Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and much needed for all the swimming in the game. much easier on my hand!
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Excellent characters make this book a start to a great series. Clary isn't a milksop mooning over her love, she grows in strength to go after it. The family relationships are complicated and difficult- just as in life. I'm looking forward to the next book to see how things are going to evolve.

B004JYU7FG|1.0|I absolutely love MOTORHEAD... But definitely not this disc. This is a terrible disc.. I still can not believe this is an official MOTORHEAD release. Every song on this disc is just terrible. Its almost as if the band was force by their record label to put out a new disc, and this is what they created.. FYI to the record label.. do not force Lemmy to put out a disc.. hes the king .. he knows what hes doing !
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I love reading this with my babies.. it made me cry the first time I heard it being read by my daughter
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is an amazing story that everyone should know. A lot of detailed information about planes, war, and the people who are on the front lines.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|There was thought, suspense, and action combined to tell the story of a future when society was paid in time and not money.  We bought the DVD because we had seen part of the movie and wanted to see all of it and our local DVD rental store didn't have it for rent.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Ok I have waited a long time for Zen to port this over to the Amazon App Store and I Love it!  Purchased the Star Wars game and played it a lot.  I do recommend everyone read the instructions on how to play.  It walks you through all the table's modes and what you are supposed to do, without this you really have no clue what to do.  Take the 5 minutes it takes to go through it.<br /><br />As for the game it self, it runs great.  A Little slowdown here and there, but managable.  Also the graphics are great, the ablility to change camera angles is nice as well.  My only complaint is the tilt sensor is a little touchy!  I \\"get\\" into the game a little and \\"shake\\" the Kindle as I hit the flippers, hence causing me to tilt by accident! Still looking for a way to somehow adjust the tilt sensor.  The audio clues do help but when multiball is happening it is tough in keep my hands steady.<br /><br />The sound is great as well, having clips from the movie really put you into the action and having Vadar, AT-AT and Stormtroopers popping up is fun!<br /><br />It will take some time to know what you need to do when you need to do it, but once you figure it out, it is a Blast!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The author creates an interesting scenario, but ultimately falls short in terms of putting together a great set of characters, fully immersive world and truly surprising plot twists.  Some of the chapters (or sections even) dragged, spending too much time on needless descriptions rather than giving us better insight into character's heads or moving along story.<br />That being said, I appreciate the book for what it was, and thought it was fairly priced.  It was an OK read, I'd just want to caution readers from having their hopes too high as mine were due to the huge number of 5 star ratings.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This movie is not at all what most people would expect. Hasbro has long neglected its older fans, so it seemed that they were completely unaware of them. Little did they realize that this was coming out.<br /><br />Set several years after the end of the television series, My Little Pony: Fall is squarely aimed at older audiences than the main of the TV series. While you will hear about the references to Nazis in the other reviews, the imagery is contextualized - indeed, the movie probably would have gotten a PG 13 rating if it had not been for the MPAA's deep concern about children watching this movie. It isn't THAT bad.<br /><br />The movie, despite its higher rating, does indeed remain about friendship, and the story is a very central one, one that I think many older fans needed to learn: Just because your friends move away and pursue their own lives does not mean that they cannot remain your friends. The main cast, along with Spike, come back together to confront their latest challenge. The movie is gritter than the rest of the series, but it is not gratuitously so, and indeed, much of the dialogue is exactly what you have come to know and love.<br /><br />There ARE a lot of in jokes in the movie that general audiences likely won't catch, but I suspect they won't actually be hurt by their lack of understanding of them; the story does stand on its own.<br /><br />The fandom will rejoice though - Luna makes her appearance here, as does Trixie, though contrary to the posters the latter only shows up for a limited time in the movie. And while it was darker than the series in general, it still ends on a good note, I think, even if it is rather bittersweet.<br /><br />Note that it is WELL worth watching through the credits, as the movie has a fairly long stinger afterwards which wraps things up nicely.<br /><br />This movie is not for SMALL kids, but I'd say most kids over the age of 10 won't be too frightened by it. I would have been fine watching it as a kid, so useyour judgement - if your kid seeing violence on-screen would alarm them, this movie is not for them. But it isn't gorn or anything, though there is certainly blood, I think it is mostly quite tasteful, and probably no more psychologically scarring than, say, All Dogs Go to Heaven (goodness knows how THAT got a G-rating).<br /><br />And as some others have noted: both the music and animation in this are absolutely stunning. They really went all out on it.
0765325950|4.0|But it kind of leaves some things hanging out there without resolution.  Otherwise a pretty good book and answers most of the questions brought up in the previous books.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|Always enjoyable to read about another's experience in the after life.<br />It is a gift to have experience's that validate that life does go on and<br />that it is all about LOVE!
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I generally love movies based on true stories. With what I remembered from the news, I was very keen to see this and I believe this is a pretty acurate movie based on facts. Naomi Watts is awesome as always, since seeing her in this movie and in The Impossible I've become a huge fan of her. Definately one to watch if your are into figuring out how the government does behind the scenes...
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Had to add it to my collection so I can watch it whenever I want! :) Can't wait to watch it again!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|For all u people that may consider buying this app, get it you suckas it's awesome!!!! The only problem is that the shop on subway surfers is way to expensive in coin wise. You'll learn that later. Level up, get experienced,  but overall, it's a pretty darn good game. You can't call a kindle a kindle without SS.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I am a very, very, very faithful Logitech user and I have lots of Logitech products from Keyboards to presenters to Harmony remotes, etc...etc... Bottom line I made the Headphones work in 5 minutes and took me 5 hours + trying to make the LGS work (important for 7.1 surround + using the G buttons on the headsets...) I simply cannot make the LGS detect the device which in this case is the G930.<br />Sound is good / mic is average. fully charged so didn't check the battery yet (they claim 10 hrs).<br />also from what I read on the Logitech forum it's been an ongoing problem since forever - looks like Logitech either became incompetent programming wise or they just don't care to solve.<br />They do admit there are some programming that needs to be addressed (on their official forum) BUT nothings' been done for more than a year now.<br />My advice (and I always supported Logitech) - don''t buy it get something else with a robust software.<br />I will update you once I get a solution I hope.<br />Otherwise I will return to Amazon (I only buy directly from amazon forget about 3rd party sellers)<br />Cheers,<br />Roger

B00B5P37IG|2.0|Although I sold this item after using it for less than a year, The Kindle Fire was a great introduction for me into the world of tablets. However, once you've realized that it's chuck full of advertising and runs on it's own version of Android, the less atractive it becomes. Also, I have trouble reading this devices screen size, so next time I'm in the market for a tablet, I will look for a pure Android operating system and a much larger screen. Paying more for a better product makes more sense to me now.

B008QE9XD2|2.0|Love the actors, and they are all good here! BUT - the problem is that the movie does not work as either a horror or a comedy. As a horror movie, it does not have the eerie mood and atmosphere of a good horror film, that even the original series pulled off. As a comedy, there were a few comic scenes, but they were not that funny or necessary. I recommend House of Dark Shadows and Night of Dark Shadows for the gothic horror feel and sense of the original series.
B00CATSONE|2.0|This was not what I expected.  I guess I wanted more of a biography of Nikola Tesla and what I got was one of those advice books with generic advice like &#34;dare to be different,&#34; and &#34;don't give up.&#34;  I guess you get what you pay for.  (That's actually useful advice!)
B004NOH9LC|3.0|Good movie - enjoyed it a lot. Better than the run of the mill romcom. With Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton you can't go very wrong. The leads were good too. Just a bit long.
078401213X|2.0|The movie lacks action and adventure. It is grainy and rough.  The story flows as simply as the summary describes.  It was difficult to follow and left me with alot more questions than answers about the plot of the film.  The characters were not fully developed and the plot was simple.  If I could return the time it took to watch this movie to myself, I certainly would.

Fun to see skrulls and Kree in the beginning for a short time. Also a treat to see the cosmic gods of the marvel universe together. Also fun some of my favorite comic book characters together like this. With story ending in a cool way.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|one of those addictive games<br />seems well made so far<br />you match 3 or more objects in a row to earn gold, open chests, attack, or collect wood and rock<br />then you go back to the home screen to upgrade weapons and armor<br />the game is different, that's for sure
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|The movie is entertaining with a lot of action. There was too much subtitles with russians talking. I was hoping it was gonna be as good as Die Hard 4, but it was not.
B000X12QQ2|4.0|I love this CD, if you liked The Zombies &#34;then&#34; you should have this.  I bought it for one of the oldies on there, but actually my favorite tracks are some of the newer ones.  I had the good fortune to see them live in March 2013 and they are still fabulous.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had to buy a couple episodes of this show because I missed them on AMC and I AM SO INTO IT I COULDN'T WAIT.<br /><br />Cannot wait for next season.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was great.  No hidden objects,  just creative clever puzzles.  I liked the hints that were available, just a little nudge without revealing the answer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't know how this book slipped by me.  I saw the preview for the movie and I'm like, what the frack is that?  Then I picked up the book and I'm like, WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT THIS EARLIER?!<br /><br />The book is great.  It has intriguing characters, a great plot with many veins and the ending is really better than I had anticipated.  That's not the right way to say that, it's, well, I thought I'd figured it out and there were a few twists at the end that were really nicely done.<br /><br />I've not checked out the rest of the series, but I might get the one after this and see if I like where it goes.  Hopefully the movie will do it some justice.<br /><br />FYI:  This is not a kids book, like the Harry Potters, there's some adult themes in here and they are much more gorey than HP books.  So parents bewarned.  If your kid is playing HALO or something like that, then this is probably fine.  And you can read it in about 2 days if you really want to.
067101756X|5.0|The Day after Roswell put the mystery to bed for me. Lt. Col. Philip Corso was present for the event and details the coverup and ensuing reverse engineering of the technology found in the debris.  He backs up all his statements with names, dates and recorded facts. For me this is the definitive book on what really happened in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Awesome!!! On the edge of my seat the entire time. Great script.  Ben Affleck was so believable. Can't wait to see it again!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is Phenomenal Outstanding Wonderful Extrodinary Adventerous Very Addicting.I CANT STOP PLAYING.DONLOAD THIS GAME NOW OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU IM SERIOUS
B001CTDH76|5.0|It's pretty corny but I like it, It's the new Colombo, I very much like the subtle ideas, & good generally over comes evil, love conquers hate.
B003SNJYSK|5.0|Forget Jack Reacher, Harry Hole (How do you say that ? ) is an intensely interesting and sympathetic character, Chilling plots and more twists and turns than the Waioeka Gorge Road. It doesn't pay to form any early opinions, because they are bound to be wrong.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I'm a big fan of Castle and knowing that the price on Amazon was cheaper than anywhere else was the cheery on top! Also it was brand new, came protected as expected and it arrived soon than I expected. Well definitely buy from the same carrier again if its available.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I can't say enough about how awesome this book was!  I am an avid reader (as in a whole book every day and a half or so).  I love hot romances, but lately, every book I've read, the characters are so damaged or come from such a damaged background, that I just want to tell those surrounding them to RUN!!  NOW!!  I mean, it's wonderful that there are truly good hearted people out there who want to help \\"fix\\" these people's problems, but in reality, if you've ever been involved with a truly \\"damaged\\" person, there's rarely the HEA that is usually portrayed in these books.  And yes, I know that's why the majority of us read, right?, to live for just a little while in a fantasy world that doesn't have to go by the strict rules of reality?  I'm right there with you.  It's just lately, it seems every book has the same theme.  Not so with Tangled.  For once, neither character is horribly damaged from an abusive past or running from some deep, dark secret.  Ok, so Drew isn't the most stand-up guy in the beginning.....but let's face it, I've known lots of guys alot like him in real life.  This was the most fun, engaging read I've enjoyed in a long time.  And I absolutely LOVE that it's entirely from Drew's POV!  It's rare that you see an entire book that way.  Granted, it's a female author, so how accurate it is as to the \\"real\\" male thought pattern may be questionable but hey, remember this is our fantasy world right?  If only you could find a male with as much angst, emotion, and depth as Drew, I say, clone that sucker and pass 'em out like candy............I want one!!  Don't hesitate to buy this book..........it's worth every penny!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Wish I had read it 50 years ago.  Recommended it to all my friends especially those with daughters.  It is the birthday gift to my daughter-in-law.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book certainly kept me on my toes! I really enjoyed all the twists and turns.  I would  definitely recommend  it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth watching, but it was a pretty good movie. Funny, good movie to spend a Sunday afternoon.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I 'purchased' this as the app of the day here on Amazon. I'm in love with it. Way less annoying than Candy Strip Saga. And more challenging too. I'm looking forward to any other apps EightyEight Games may create for Android.
B005LAIHEA|2.0|Long story short: Tom (Jason Segel; Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jeff Who Lives At Home) and Violet (gorgeous Emily Blunt; The Devil Wears Prada, The Wolfman) are an engaged couple who's upcoming wedding day keeps getting delayed for various reasons.  Through deaths, careers, and education, family and friends begin to wonder whether or not Tom and Violet are ever going to walk down the aisle.  And, you know what, so did I.<br /><br />While the performances are great and the overall story is interesting enough, the biggest problems here are pacing and structure.  The movie is all over the place.  The story feels very episodic as, in one scene while taking care of her niece, Violet is shot in the leg with an arrow.  Obviously, Alex (Chris Pratt; Wanted, \\"Parks and Recreation\\"), Tom's best friend and father to Violet's niece, is pissed that Tom's negligence led to the accidental shooting.  Then suddenly we flash cut to Alex toasting Tom for being a great guy.  This type of editing makes you forget that you're watching a movie and not a soap opera which also helps to contribute to the overlong run time.  Through out the duration of the movie, I kept wanting to either look at the clock or found myself thinking about something else entirely.  Jokes are repeated.  \\"Don't worry, they'll live.\\"  Jump to a funeral.  \\"At least no one died\\".  Once again, another funeral and still no wedding.  Tom grows a really fake looking, Yosammitti Sam beard anc mustache.  On the sleeve is reprinted Owen Gleiberman's glowing blurb, \\"Lively, Original, and Hilarious.\\"  Did we see the same movie?  More like \\"Dead, Cliched, With Moments of Comedy.\\"  This may be good enough to watch once but I wouldn't add it to my collection.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Who wants to read just for fun, this book is for you. But if you're looking for something more sophisticated, more mentally enriching, choose an author who is more experienced.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|I gave it three stars because the unrated version unexpectedly is filled with many, many scenes better suited to a XXX porno movies. They dwell on these explicit scenes, which add little to the story, which, by the way, is an excellent drama. This is a penthouse production, so, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. I enjoyed the complex story of Caligula's progression from a normal, perverted wealthy citizen to his belief that he was a god. I would have preferred an &#34;R&#34; rated version, since it is a good story, with excellent acting a visuals.
B0015XASFS|4.0|Like it very much.  I listened to it several times before I decided if I liked it.  I would recommend it.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I enjoyed this novel, it's very contemporary and may be the perfect blend of old school and now. The use of texting and footnotes to move a story line is brilliant. The English tones add to the dual development of the plot. Enjoy!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, great for families, for adults, for anyone.  It has such a sweet storyline and I think everyone needs to see this movie.
0316113514|5.0|This is a great book!!!  Shows us why exercise is important to students as well as seniors.  I was impressed with what schools in Chicago were doing with their students to not only improve their health but to help them with their learning processes.  Every teacher, parent and student should read this.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As I read this book, it became more than a story, it was a happening. It has made me rethink a number of things.
0385349947|5.0|I've really enjoyed this book. I feel it's honest, and touches on many things I've thought about as I further my career. Things I didn't even realize I was thinking!<br />As a female business owner, it's even changed my thoughts on how I'll run my business!<br />I've referred this book to male and female friends alike, and all have also said they enjoyed reading it. The males have said it gives them a better understanding of women in the workplace.<br />It's fair and balanced and doesn't talk down to women who may choose to stay at home after having kids, which I like immensely. It's an easy path to take, and I feel like there has been a weird war between women who stay at home with the kids, and the women who go back to work.<br />I think all the negative stuff that has been tossed up by this book is not worth a second thought. Buy this book, and look at someones opinion on the matter, and see if you agree. At very least, it will give you some very interesting things to think about!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a terrific book on many levels.  I wish I had the benefit of her insights years ago.  A must read for women of all ages and men too!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|A light look at competition of young adults in groups singing without instruments. Film portrays the meaness, determination, weaknesses, infatuation, humor and talent  that competition can ignite.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Unexpected charactes and effects. The movie closely followed the book, but offered enough twists to keep me interested. I recommend this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app!  I highly recommend everyone that want's to read and get to know our precious Lord to get it and study it........
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Its such a great series! Not really a horror fan, but this one comes off as a drama or a suspense more than a horror.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very Good game just scary kuz it could happen so easily. I hope another game comes out soon or the zombie add on becomes free
B008393Q2O|2.0|I need to be able to copy text from notes which I create in this app ... to my Android device's clipboard.  I don't see any way to do this.  Developers, please add this functionality!
0393338398|1.0|This book has way too many statistics.  Read the first three chapters then just watch the movie with Brad Pitt, you won't miss anything.
B008XG1X18|5.0|These are gifts for my friends grandchildren.  They absolutely love them and carry them around with them - erverywhere!  I couldn't have found a better gift.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Program has helped me in woodworking calculations, finding multiple pieces of wood from an overall length.  Good for my grandson too.
B008AX18Y6|1.0|A few years back I tried reading the same authors Moors Last Sigh but struggled to get beyond the first few pages. Not to the type to give up I finally decided that I must read a Salman Rushdie book and got down to reading this one. The book had a promising start but then stated to get repetitive and  reached megalomaniacal proportions with the author sincerely believing that the whole world had to come to a stand still to help him survive. While as the book does give an understanding of what \\"Joseph Anton\\" must have gone through it was all about how he was right and the rest of the world whether Iranians or the British were all wrong. That is the first and last book from Salman for me.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Classic, my brother and I read this book as kids and no we I am reading to my kids.<br />LOVE the memories...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is great! It has a smooth, quality feel to it, and the puzzles are challenging without being too frustrating. I look forward to the next chapter!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! The best book out of all five. I love everyone's story, but Arya is my favorite.
1579128149|5.0|Gray's book is informative, brilliantly designed, and beautifully illustrated, displaying a real passion for the elements. Everyone interested in science should have this on the coffee table.
0307990850|2.0|Luckily for me, I didn't spend any money on this book.  I have been an ardent fan of the Reacher series from Day One, and this one comes across like it was written by someone else besides the usual author.  Child phoned this one in, forgetting to include suspense and most of the usual Reacher sarcasm and satisfying battles.  He gratuitously kills off a sympathetic charachter, and when the plot is revealed, it's a big yawn.<br /><br />I will get other Reacher books, but the next one had better be good!  As for the movie, I won't even see it.
B007TKT2SK|1.0|I have no idea why I downloaded this since my phone already has a calculator to begin with, I mean seriously I just wanted the free mp3 $1 credit added to my account.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|30 Seconds to mars its just a way of life to me... They keep changin their style on each album but never desappointed me, this album just show another masterpiece I can't be happier with the result i totally love them, thier work and this album, this is a must have item no matter if you are a true believer or not
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|i only downloaded this to get a free $1 mp3 credit and I ended up buying a queens of the stone age song for free! thanks 10000000 app!
B00479SVBU|4.0|It is easy to use and sounds fantastic.  Much better sound than I expected and better than the cheap headphones that came with the MP3 player.  I use this with an RCA MP3 with the USB cord.  It couldn't be much easier to use and I would definitely buy another one, even though it has some problems.<br />Problems:<br />- After a few minutes, the LCD view turns inside out so you look at it from the back of the text.  Weird.  But I'm driving, so I don't care.<br />- The remote is almost useless.  Sometimes you can't get the buttons to work at all.  I no longer use it and just press the button on the unit.  Easy enough in my car.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|It had a good cast, and strong acting, but some of the violence seemed gratuitous and silly. Would not watch again.
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|the subtitles on this movie are 15 to 30 seconds behind the spoken word.  This is a lot. Please fix this Amazon. Movie tries for funny. Hits some. Misses some. A little too violent to be what was intended for Americans. Understand it did very well in Europe. Actors make it worth a watch.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Need to go back to the beginning after started watching in season 3.  Just a great series to watch, smart funny and suspenseful.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a classic for me. I remember watching it on tv a long time ago when I was a kid. Now that I have my own copy, I can enjoy my childhood anytime I want to. This is an incredible anime movie with a wonder storyline.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Started watching the series at the end of season 3 and then went back to the beginning.  It is funning suspenseful and just fun to watch.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Takes me back to being a kid. I love this movie. It is exquisite in BluRay.  I could not be happier.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|You've should try this game<br />I love this game<br /><br />I Thought it was a suky game till i got use to the controls
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Bought it for my Daughters. They loved it. I cant wait to see the sequel to it, and also buy the book
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a great game to play when.your at home and have nothing to do. Even better that its free.
0307279189|5.0|First of all I never thought I would find myself reading a book about running.  I am a runner and I like running, but to read a whole book about it?!?!  How boring can you get, right?  Wrong.  This was actually very entertaining.  These guys run at a whole different level than I could ever imagine.  It's spiritual to them where for most people it's something to do to stay in shape. While, I found the book very entertaining and at times pretty exciting there were some scientific/research parts that weren't my favorite.  I did like the races and I'm amazed at how easy and effortless the author makes running appear and feel for some people.  My biggest complaint is that now I'm obsessed with obtaining that level of running and find myself researching ultra marathons.  My family thinks I'm nuts for even considering running one at my age,44.  Maybe I am.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Although written long ago, the album is excellent and timely, The son , Ragpicker's dream is the timelsess story of the Rail King riding a freight from the cold north to Florida. He and his pal drink a bottle of hooch that unloeashes the ragpicker's dream of being just like a family for Christmas, having an imaginary dinner served by a lovely girl then, still in the dream, the castaways are set upon by the reailroad cops and beaten but the Rail King  still wishes good even for the bulls.<br />Mark Knopfler is a great storytelling songster and every song on this album is a jewel. This Geordie boy did good!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My daughter recommended that I check out Downton Abbey, as she knows that I like British period pieces, so my wife and I tried it out on Netflix. The first episode (series 1) was good, but didn't really grab either of us. It was good enough, however, that we thought we'd give it another try. We're now midway through series 2 (on Amazon Prime, as Netflix only had series 1) and I must confess that we've both been drawn in.<br /><br />Downton Abbey does come across as a British soap opera, but the writing is very good, as is the acting. My one pet peeve is Elizabeth McGovern's standard &#34;head tilted slightly down with eyes raised and a smirk&#34; face that's really getting on my nerves. But that's just me. My wife and I will continue on, watching through series 3 on Amazon Prime and will probably tune in on TV when series 4 comes to the U.S. next January.<br /><br />The only other negative (sorry Amazon), is the occasionally choppy picture (HD) and frequently choppy sound we get watching via Amazon Prime on our notebook PC connected to our wide screen TV. We never had any degradation via Netflix for series 1. But that's a technical problem and has nothing to do with the fine quality of the Downton Abbey series.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Absolutely, though it is certainly a subjective matter of taste: &#34;Your mileage may vary.&#34;
0385536828|1.0|This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.  I would not have gone past the first couple of pages but it was given to me as a gift so I very painfully read to the end.  So boring and typically English.  Not my cup of tea at all!
1441419519|4.0|Bought this for my son. When I was a kid it was Hesse was THE author to read. GOt my son hooked on him too now
B0098460O4|5.0|These two are the best that I have heard in a long time! I wish the best for them and can't wait for them to appear in the U.S.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I hadn't read any reviews before I finished reading.  While I don't really disagree with a lot of the negative reviews here, I just think many people took this series too seriously. I agree that there was some really clunky storytelling, inexplicable scenes and flattening of characters to force the inevitable ending. I just never really expected more than that. (Though, considering some of the entertaining love scenes in earlier books, the final one was just... Not very good at all. (C'mon Sookie, you expect me to believe THAT was the best you've had? We both know better!) These books always had a 'there's no place like home.' arc to them. The most disappointing aspect to me was that in the end it was more about Sookie learning to 'fit in and settle down' than finding her own path and making the most of her unique gifts. Still, it was readable and entertaining, which is all it really needed to be.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I got this app because I have 14 grandchildren! These scans are something Fun to do.It even came close to my age! I Love having some fun things to do with my grandkids,not just learning.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|As a teacher, I have used all sorts of timers to time students giving presentations, for tests, etc.  Most are slightly clunky or plain annoying.  This app, however, is sleek and simple to use.  It has so many functions, keeps a log of all timing activity, has multiple alarm options,and has proven itself time and again.  I even used it to proctor standardized tests because it is consistent and easy to set.  This is so handy!
147674355X|5.0|I loved everything about this book. It had alot of things going on and I was never bored. I can't wait for the sequal.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|It was fairly entertaining not a great movie, but a good one. Story line was pretty good. Good graphics etc.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun and highly addictive.  Only drawback is not being able to use coins to lurched game credits and having to exit the game to add friends via facebook in order to complete collections.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Warning!  This game is very addictive!  The gameplay, music, and visuals are excellent.  But if you sit down to play for &quot;just a few minutes,&quot; don't be surprised to find an hour has passed instead.  You have been warned!
B0094K1K42|3.0|I like Charlize Theron so I watched it. It was an ok movie but nothing spectacular. Good if you have free time.
B00CFQN12Q|1.0|We sat down hoping to enjoy another Die Hard movie. Unfortunately, we were left still hoping. What an awful movie. Try to find something else to do. Like a wirebrush suppository, maybe. Anything will be better than this dog.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|usually game glitches are in game action bugs...this is the first game where the bug prevents you from buying it.  I guess G5 doesn't want to make money.  upon clicking unlock game some gears appear and spin and it says loading.  nothing ever happens except eventually text appears saying continue game. if you click then you are taken back to screen to unlock game...so its a fun game just realize you might not be able to finish it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I had read this book before and remembered how much I enjoyed it the first time around.  But the second time, for my book club selection, it resonated so much more for me.  This is a book you should buy in a bookstore; don't borrow it from a library, or download it to your Kindle. Just like you can't smell a digital rose that is hanging on your wall, you can't enjoy the turning of a page and the special aroma that an open book provides.  You will be glad you physically own this book for multiple reads as well as the dictionary of flower meanings at the back of the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I LOVED this game . I also played a lot of the mist type games . It was very short but the price was right. It was a wonderful break from a lot of the mindless games out right now.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Let's just say I am a big Reacher fan.  That being said, when I saw the previews I thought Tom Cruise was totally the wrong actor for the part.  Any of you that know Reacher, know what I am talking about.  If you know the character, you may enjoy this movie more than a first timer.  The acting leaves pauses where Reacher is thinking.  If you know the character, you will know what's going on and how he thinks.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.
1400049628|5.0|If your a zombie enthusiast this book has a very indepth research on different weapons and accounts of how to survive a zombie encounter thoe it's a must read
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am not a &quot;gamer&quot; so this is a perfect little game for me. Challenging, but not so difficult that I don't have fun. My 13 yr old and my 9 yr old  also enjoy playing it.
0307346617|5.0|Books great couldn't put it down no spoilers but the book full of different people's account of the Z-Apocalypse read the zombie survival hand book by the same author makes this book even better
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|I love Volbeat!  I have all of their albums, but I have to say that I definitely like their previous album compared to this one, so a little disappointed, but still enjoyed.
B00785P2QC|5.0|amazing game two thumbs up great job guys G5 is the best games that you will find in the app store GUARANTEED hands down
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Fun game but keeps freezing and closing on my Kindlefire. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but, sorry, three times and you're out! Also, too many ads.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|I like this mic very much. It sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made. I do not use it in a professional capacity though but it certainly seems well enough made to stand up to plenty of use.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|it's a fun game, good quality and decent playstyle, the problem stems from the fact that you have to download almost a half gig of extra information.    The biggest issues here are that the game is nothing but jungle runner or whatever that is, only in iron man suits, which then the movie decided not to even have you see or learn anything about, talk about a let down.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Beautiful cinematography and moving storyline of characters whose<br />destinies criss-cross each other throughout history.<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Halle Berry have wonderful chemistry as they<br />discover their intertwined fate.  The scenes where they speak<br />a futuristic language are especially compelling.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think it is gonna be a good book<br />Awesome cool and exciting can't wait<br />Gonna be awesome like a possum
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game I ridiculously awesome I have to collect eight pages it is sooo scary I can't sleep at night get it now!!!!!!
B003XDZNLW|4.0|This is the second pair of this style Crocs that I've bought. They fit just fine and are comfortable. They dry pretty fast, too.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I am finding that the new writers are not in keeping with the way that Jordan wrote. Same in some ways but I get the feeling that the men that can chanel are to much up to modern day hoodlums.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Quick comment before my review I was able to play this without internet access.<br /> (I have a firewall on my phone and blocked Fruit Ninja.  It still launched and played, I did not have the leader boards or online play but that is expected.)<br /><br />My actual review, I enjoy the game it is simple but fun, a good quick time waster. I have played the free one in the past and it has been on and off my phone for awhile.  This is not a game to immerse yourself in but rather something to play while you wait in line or need to kill a couple minutes.<br /><br />I would probably give it 4 stars but it does have permissions that are excessive for a game, so that knocks it down another star.<br />They actually appear to have less permissions for the google play paid version, they should have dropped permissions from the amazon version as well.<br />I saw no ads but that may have been because I blocked fruit ninja's network access on my phone, if there are ads in a payed app that seems like a poor choice by the developers, and probably should knock off another star, or at least a half of one.<br /><br />So I'd actually give this 2.5 stars but I can't and I am in a generous mood so I'll round up to 3.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The small ear buds don't ever stay in my ears, especially when exercising and running.  These stay put and don't take up alot of space or feel bulky.  Great product for the price.
B000001F6N|5.0|I always had heard of Peter Green's playing ability, and how he took over when Clapton left the Bluesbreakers, but I never knew of or sought out this material. What an amazing discovery. Green was a masterful player and songwriter, whose songwriting ability, at that time, was far above Eric Clapton's efforts.

B00CS65JS2|5.0|I've spent a lot of time listening to music throughout my life, but only became serious about analyzing and understanding music after reading American Psycho. I was able to satisfy myself with Yield by Pearl Jam and Red by Taylor Swift, but for Random Access Memories I stumbled upon a very thorough website: http://rapgenius.com/albums/Daft-punk/Random-access-memories<br /><br />The light funk/electronica sound of the album is definitely a Daft Punk product with their usual recursive lyrics mixed in, but an overall much softer feel than their earlier work. After 8 years since their last studio album, I interpreted \\"Get Lucky\\" as a just a comeback statement, but it turns out love is a major theme of the album-- but not as major as Daft Punk exploring the importance of their robotic personas. On the surface, I really enjoyed the groove and easy listening but if you decide to go deeper then Daft Punk has a lot of thought-provoking things to say.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I think it's all been said already.<br /><br />I love Daft Punk and have most of their albums, with the exception of the tron soundtrack.<br /><br />This is not a daft punk album.  It's freakin' incredible though.  Doubt you will find a better put together chill elctro disco dance album out there.  Pop it in the car or put on the headphones at work and melt into it.<br /><br />Not what I expected but I'd buy it again and recommend it to my friends.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Perhaps one weak track....the rest is at the same level of some his more recent works.  What struck me is the production and wonderful melodies over simplistic chord structures.  To me at least the sign of an outstanding pop songwriter.  Lyrically Bowie has stuck to what he does best, but it appears that his continued association with Visconti is paying dividends at this late stage in his career.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Jones, it's good to have you back.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Although it feels a bit truncated at times (as if it was edited down from a much longer original work), this is a beautiful movie that explores the human condition, human frailties, the resonance of our actions throughout our environment and throughout time and our struggle, through different stages of life and reincarnation, to rectify our wrongs and correct our weaknesses.  The underlying theme is that love is eternal, those important/significant to us continue to appear over and over again throughout our existence until our conflict with them is resolved or our combined purpose is fulfilled.  Lots of eastern philosophy.<br />Don't get discouraged by the seeming dissonance of the first 30 minutes....hang on and see the various relationships and sub-plots unfold.  Well worth your time.

1907523685|5.0|No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West. That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando.<br /><br />Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.<br /><br />But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.<br /><br />\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?).<br /><br />And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty. At times the sensual writing seems almost feverish, and Woolf adds an almost mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.<br /><br />And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma. He starts off the story as an elusive romantic teenager, suffers a heartbreak that matures him as an artist, and post-metamorphosis she becomes a woman of the modern world. Both in mind and body, Orlando is a very different woman at the end than the boy s/he began as.<br /><br />\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a truly spellbinding book -- Virginia Woolf's prose enthralls the senses while her main character explores the boundaries of gender. A must-read, for everyone.st mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.<br /><br />And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma.

1594746168|4.0|They say not to judge a book by its cover. But with the cover of \\"The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black,\\" what you see is what you get.<br /><br />And to be honest, the picture of a winged-humanoid skeleton, with every bone carefully catalogued, was enough to reel me into checking out this book. It's a pseudo-biography of a fictional man who devoted himself to the scientific study of ancient mythical creatures -- and while E.B. Hudspeth spins a fine fictional biography, the illustrations are what really took my breath away.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Spencer Black, a 19th-century physician whose father was a grave-robbing professor of anatomy. That fascination with anatomy carried over into Black's career -- first he became fascinated by transformation in the insect world, and then by the workings of the human body. But when he encounters the corpse of a \\"fawn-child,\\" his research took an unexpected turn.<br /><br />After that, Dr. Black came up with a shocking, controversial theory: that mythical creatures were not only real, but were ancestors of humanity. According to him, birth defects were just those ancient genetic traits trying to resurface. So he tried to create his own \\"mythical\\" creatures by grafting together body parts from different animals -- which, unsurprisingly, the scientific community was unimpressed by.<br /><br />The late 19th century is a perfect era for the fictional Dr. Black -- it was a time of massive technological advances and strange new pseudosciences. Just think of the Fiji Mermaid. So while \\"The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black\\" is an entirely fictional work, EB Hudspeth manages to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality -- you can almost believe it is a biography of a real person.<br /><br />He also does an excellent job writing a pseudo-biography, exploring the events in Black's life (failed surgery, death of his children) that fueled his obsessions. Hudspeth even writes letters to/from Black, as well as a journal entry from his brother Bernard about his first, horrifying \\"graft.\\"<br /><br />But the most fascinating part of the book is not the fictional biography, but the \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia.\\" In this, we can see beautifully detailed drawings of sphinxes, harpies, fluttering multi-finned mermaids, dragons (serpentine and regular), pegasi, and countless other mythical creatures. Not only are these the most realistic depictions of mythical creatures I have ever seen, but they are the most scientifically plausible.<br /><br />Hudspeth achieves this by examining these creatures down the muscles, organs and bones, which are catalogued in painstaking detail. He even catalogues them by different orders and fictional families -- for instance, the Siren Oceanus is a member of the family Sirenidae and the genus Siren, with internal lungs covered in gills.<br /><br />\\"The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black\\" is an exquisite piece of work -- a solid, sometimes horrifying pseudo-biography, followed by exquisitely realistic depictions of mythic creatures. If nothing else, read this for Hudspeth's beautiful illustrations.to/from Black, as well as a journal entry from his brother Bernard about his first, horrifying \\"graft.\\"<br /><br />But the most fascinating part of the book is not the fictional biography, but the \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia.\\" In this, we can see beautifully detailed drawings of sphinxes, harpies, fluttering multi-finned mermaids, dragons (serpentine and regular), pegasi, and countless other mythical creatures.

B008220DGE|2.0|The Master<br /><br />This has got to be one of the more disgusting films I have seen in modern times.<br /><br />We're introduced to Freddie Quill, a guy on the beach (apparently these are at the closing days of WWII) and he is humping and fingering a sand sculpture of a woman.  Doesn't say much for the morale of Navy officers.  I'm sure it will offend a few Navy folks, but I digress.<br /><br />After some drunken brawls and a fight at a department store where he roughs up his patrons (one of which is the \\"Master\\" who does not remember him as they happen to meet later in the film) he runs away and sneaks aboard a yacht run by the Master and his crew.<br /><br />The parody of Dianetics is obvious and so the controversy in some media circles about the film.  Some user reports erroneously called the film an expose on Scientology which is completely not true.<br /><br />The film uses sex and violence to build its case regarding the relationship between Quill and Drummond (the Master).  It builds its case with the people who practically worship Drummond but Drummond seems relieved that someone just sees him as a man with some family issues and major drinking problems.<br /><br />The scene at the jail with these two trading invectives and later on where Quill sees ugly old naked women is particularly off putting.  What was the point being made?  Where was the drama?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This film is purported to be loosely based on Dianetics but seems more a parody.  The comedic elements are swamped by the images of sex, drugs and alcohol and violence and how even those who think they have all the answers can crash and burn.  The ending was insufficient, and left more questions than answers.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is wonderful! I bought it about ten weeks ago, it took me about two days to get used to the 4000 dpi setting and then 3 more to get used to the 8000 dpi setting on windows, the dpi settings are decent for in game, I keep it at 2000 - 4000 for most uses and then 8000 mostly for windows. I have used this mouse on an iMac and can say it works fine but the button mapping for the side buttons will be the default only as there is no customization for them, though maybe you can set button 4 in the mac settings, I did not try.<br /><br />The input on this mouse has no lag, even through the usb1.1 port on my Reclusa keyboard, the mouse also requires little power, I was initially afraid I would not be able to use it plugged into my keyboard becauseit does not have enough juice running through its' ports to power a dualshock 3 or a Razer naga (molten edition).<br />This mouse has two profile settings, I only need two, one for games and one for windows, I mapped  L alt, L control, and R to the side buttons for the game profle, for windows I have mapped forward, back, and mute to the side buttons for my windows profile. The button to switch profiles is on the bottom and out of the way, whether that is a good thing or bad thing is up the user, personally I am fine with it as I don't accidently switch out the mode I want to be in.<br /><br />The cord on this mouse is braided and does not cause it to move to much on it's own once it has loosened up a bit which only took a few times wrapping it back up to take somewhere and then unwrapping to use and vice versa. I have a slight worry about where the cord meets the mouse though. The \\"dock\\" ( I cannot think of the proper term for where the cord mounts onto a device) for the cord seems cheap, while I doubt it will fall apart it could use improvement in this area.<br /><br />The feel of the mouse is good. My only qualm is how all my fingers fit on it but my pinky could use a little more support, a small wing would be perfectthe perfect solution, or maybe even some buttons added in that area could help. This is not a deal breaker, just something to get used to.<br /><br />The weight system seems cheap but does work. It required more force then I anticipated to open the weight compartment. The weights one by one can make all the difference in the world, though it is tough to notice. I personally thought it was too light at first, so I added 2 weights at a time and decided all but one was perfect.<br /><br />The LED customization was fun to play with but only changes the palm logo, not an issue as I consume a lot of media and have my hands off the mose often and can revel in it's glorious breathing light.<br /><br />The scroll wheel is responsive, and while it doesn't click you can easily feel when it has gone up or down. The middle button is tight at first but loosens up with minimal use.<br /><br />I do not use the macro record feature, it maps only mouse buttons. The macro programmer however allows you to map keyboard keys.<br /><br />The software is non-intrusive and easy to use, I do not need to use it often andd it just sits there on my taskbar's hidden icons not bothering me.<br /><br />The bottom line is: I love this mouse, it's price, and it's functionality! If you want a great mouse that has amazing dpi, looks cool, performs flawlessly, and is incredibly accurate, buy this and save your wallet from the unnecessary expenditure that the big name mice have.<br /><br />Thank you Anker for creating this mouse, I look forward to a keyboard or second gaming mouse from you guys.

B00168HARG|4.0|I should note that I'm a huge fan of the franchise, even of extensions that others don't like (such as the third film, or the games). As such I'm more open-minded than most, and I've noticed more than a few things about this series that others have been missing.<br /><br />First off the premise, and the descriptions given by others, can be very misleading. This series is by no means a 'true sequel to T2', nor does it replace or ignore T3. This series is really a sequel to the established story. It alters the timeline from a previous point and causes the entire story to scew into something completely new. If you really want to get the most out of this series, watch it after viewing the films (and if you want, playing the games).<br /><br />Secondly, the series itself does have some flaws that could be deal breakers to some. For one thing, you'd best be a fan of modern 'indy' filming. The series will barrage you with a series of split second shots and unsteady camera work. Most of the time you won't really be able to tell what's going on. Some people like the energy this style has, others find it confusing and even annoying.<br /><br />The acting is solid all around, but the writing can be so-so. The series bounces between action sci-fi with a well developed plot and a soap opera for teens. It quickly becomes clear that the reason they set the series in modern day and violated the timeline was so they could focus on John's struggle with puberty. As such there will be times that Sara and Co. will be fleeing and fighting various Cyborg death machines and uncovering conspiracies, and other times we watch as John goes to school, feels awkward, and tries to get friends (mostly to get laid). It does have the spirit of the films, but it also has a strong vein of 90210, Beverly Hills, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />It's still a great show, especially by modern standards. But it is by no means perfect, nor is it set between T2 and T3.

B008BU75IQ|1.0|I could barely wait for this to be released as I had truly enjoyed the first two books of the Clifton Chronicles.  Reading this book was like reading several drawn out chapters of an unfinished novel.  No point, stereotype characters with little to make you care about what happens to them...good or bad. Each character was a shell with little humanity and only there to move the shabby plot along its inevitable path.  Having enjoyed many of Jeffrey Archer's books in the past, I even questioned if he actually wrote this one.  Boring, predictable and a total waste of time.

'trouble' has found me and it will not be leaving my stereo system for months to come; yes, it's that good.  great.  reserved.  heartbreaking.  heartwarming.  annoying.  brittle.  classic.

0399165274|5.0|An enraged ultra Jihadist terrorist has taken to internet airwaves to encourage fellow male Muslims in America and England to shave their body except for their beards, wear traditional Muslim white clothing, select a prominent American or English person, and kill him for Allah. People call this fanatic The Preacher. Although quite bold and persuasive on screen, The Preacher hides by not revealing his name and by covering the bottom part of his face. He is so successful in persuading diaspora Muslims in the US and England to murder prominent citizens that the US president has added The Preacher to his \\"kill list.\\" Agencies are encouraged to identify, find, and kill him. One of the US's secret agencies has a group of such killers, and among them is the best, Lieutenant Kit Carson, no relation to the famed hero of the west, but a hero in his own right. Carson received training in a host of skills, including fighting he learned in Iraq, tracking skills acquired in NCIS, languages including Arabic, and has been successful in bringing many men to justice. So successful in fact that he is called The Tracker. He is tasked to find The Preacher's identity, locate and kill him. This is the plot of this chase thriller by Frederick Forsyth.<br /><br />The Tracker is helped by unusual people and this enhances interest in the novel. Among others there is a teen-age boy with Asperger's syndrome and agoraphobia, who is afraid of leaving a part of his house but is more expert in the use of computers than any government agent. There is an Israeli agents imbedded in Somalia. We are introduced to the inner workings of the CIA, FBI, MI5, MI6, Mossad, the use of drones, and surprisingly Somalia pirates and the way they negotiate with the owners of the ships they hijack. Forsyth is well-known for his best-sellers The Day of the Jackal and The Odessa File and this suspenseful thriller will in all likelihood be a best-seller as well.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|When I first listen to Get Lucky, I thought, \\"THISISNOTDAFTPUNK,WHATDIDTHEYDO\\" and so I stopped listening to it a day later. I also thought of this when I heard the album off of itunes. But then something occurred to me--I typically don't like the sounds and music of today, like those top 40s on the radio and such. So, while in the car, I put in the CD for Random Access Memories. I then thought, this is great, great in the sense that it's so different from everything else, and these retro yet fresh sounds are what I really needed.<br /><br />Although to be fair, there are some songs which I'd rather skip (I'm looking at you, 'Touch') but overall, I had one criteria that to me, defined Daft Punk. I could get into the music, whereas with the music of today, I could only analysis it. I couldn't appreciate it for what it was; like \\"why and how did that rapper appear?\\" or \\"why is there a dubstep solo?\\" And with the past and present Daft Punk I could get lost in the music, and that's what, to me, really matters.

B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I am very impressed at the accuracy and eliability of this app. I highly recommend this to those who need a good and dependable clock.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Star Trek in Blu Ray. Need I say more. Can't wait to sit and watch them all back to back.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What a joy! No wonder Dickens had a smash hit on his hands when this came out. Among other things it has probably the happiest of happy endings ever written. Look at the final section where Scrooge discovers that it's Christmas morning and he has another chance. It's Dickens at his greatest. Read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" to discover it or re-read it for the tenth time -- it will delight your heart and enrich your day.
6305511055|5.0|If you like spy movies this is a classic to have; RR is great as always and the story keeps you captivated throughout.  I was very happy to get it sooner than expected and it came on a Friday so it was just right for Friday night movie night :). I would recommend this vendor.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I was quite surprised at how silly this movie was.<br /><br />The silliest of the intertwined plots involved Hugh Grant as the prime minister, who falls in love with a worker in his household. Hugh looked as embarrassed as I felt watching it, when he suddenly loses it, seeing the sleazy US president (played by Billy Bob Thornton) making a pass at his lady love. This gives him the gumption to tell off the US in front of everyone in a press conference. And then, (ha ha), the Prime Minister stumbles backstage of a school Christmas play, and noshes with the girl, as the curtains open, exposing the two love birds to the entire audience-- Ho, ho, those daffy prime ministers are just more lovable when they get into hijinks like this. If only all politicians and world leaders would spend their time falling in love, instead of all that state business nonsense, it would be a better world!)
B0009HLD0K|5.0|I have a bike trainer that I use indoors and this movie really gets you going and its very entertaining as well.  As a cyclist this movie is a classic; I remember seeing at the theaters when it came out because it was a cycling movie....I think they should make more. The DVD is flawless and I would recommend this vendor for sure.
B000FC130E|5.0|Everything you've come to expect from Neil Gaiman is in this book. Very entertaining and definitely worth multiple reads! I loved it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Maybe you've seen the movie, maybe you haven't. You will be surprised around every turn! This is one of the best series of books I've ever read! People always say that the sequels are never as good as the original, but Suzanne Collins proves that wrong! Catching Fire and Mockingjay are even better than Hunger Games!
B003KGBIRK|5.0|I had the DVD copy of this movie, but this edition blows the DVD out of the water on picture quality. Much nicer and pleasant to enjoy. It is a bit of a price difference between this and the DVD, but worth the extra bucks in my opinion.
1400069742|5.0|Those Angry Days covers the two years leading up to the U.S. involvement in the Second World War. The fact that it comes after seven decades simply confirms that several generations must pass before many important details surface either from private or government sources. Historian Olson appears to have culled every available source to bring the story into focus. The late distinguished historian, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., once noted \\"History is indeed an argument without end.\\" Indeed it is, but Those Angry Days is about as close to an \\"end\\" of the \\"battle\\" over our involvement in the Second World War: Should America, just emerging from the Great Depression, aid Great Britain with treasure and/or blood as Nazi Germany stood poised to vanquish the island nation? Angry words--and often blunt threats to life and limb- flew between those determined to keep us out of the European conflict and those equally determined to thrust us in. Those \\"angry days\\" ended with the attack on Pearl Harbor followed shortly by Germany's declaration of war on the U.S.<br />  This most certainly should be assigned reading to students as an introduction to the Second World War. Two powerful groups clashed over what would be in the best interests of the nation. But when war came there was but one goal: Victory.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works well always opens.  Has all the functions I need. Like the font size.  The only one that I need.<br />Especially liked that it was free.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Only have time for a quick review.<br /><br />Deliciously tense and despairing, with a small inkling of hope only to be dashed ever so quickly and stirring the cycle again.<br /><br />Life and death are so very capricious in Wool... and I wouldn't have it any other way. I definitely recommend it, with the caveat that the overall mythos conspiracy needs better resolving. Here's hoping Howey delivers it in time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I first played this game on my dad's phone and I was hooked. I found it on my I pod but it did not have the 4x4 or the semi. I just found it hear on my kindle and now this is all I do is play hill climb.<br /><br />it is loads of fun, but be careful it is very addictive.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love the game a lot!!! Awsome ,fun, can not stop playing. Need more levels. Thank you for a lot of fun time.

B00AKKTDJY|1.0|For what is supposed to be a 'pay' app you are in reality only getting a part of the game. After completing the first set of levels I was prompted with an advertisement to buy another restaurant for $4. In app purchases within an application you have to buy in the first place is not acceptable. This is the stuff you expect to find in free games. Sorry PlayFirst, but double dipping is not allowed.<br /><br />In addition at the completion of every single level the game throws up and advertisement for another game in the &#34;Dash&#34; series. There is no &#34;stop showing me this&#34; button, nor is there an option to turn them off. If you want to pitch your other games, put a button on the main screen for those interested in finding them. Don't interrupt the game every level, all it does is annoy.<br /><br />Initial responsiveness on the main menu is pretty bad, even on the Nexus 4, however once you get going in the game it's fine. On phones without physical buttons you need to be extremely cautious touching near the lower right corner, because if you accidentally tap the back button on the screen it kicks you back to the main menu without a confirmation screen and you will lose your progress on that level.<br /><br />To conclude, this game needs to either be offered free, or the in app purchases must be removed to get a higher rating. In addition, removal of the ads every level and a confirmation screen on the back button would get it up to the full 5 stars.
B00A7KKPDK|4.0|on the cover of the book, there seem to be traces of some sort of adhesive that doesn't come off. there's not alot but i'd like it better if the book was completely clean. the inside is fine though so i can't complain.
B00BZOD63S|5.0|Great suspense that needed no campy gore to keep me interested! My friends and I all enjoyed this movie & have it stored for my kindle for later uses. I Loved it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am sorry to see it end.  I knew it would have to someday.  And of course, it ended with Sookie up to her neck in trouble again!  But bless her heart, she manages to get out of it pretty much unharmed and wins in the end.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The only thing that I don't like is they only let you visit two friends a day. Cool game. Habit forming. Lol
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Tarantino never disappoints.  Bit bloody and some scenes are very difficult to watch.  Old spaghetti Western music at beginning rolling credits is great and gets you in the mood.  Horrendous how the slaves were treated and Tarantino shows this.  Most historic themed movies ignore the sadistic side of slavery and the helplessness of the slaves.  This pretty much covers that....and it is probably tame.<br /><br />Leo is really good...switching from Southern charm to manic evil in seconds and...he is so easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Jamie makes the switch from slave to knowledgeable bounty hunter a bit too quickly...but he had motivation and I am willing to overlook this glaring lapse in the story line.  When he reads a wanted poster...he goes right through it and gets caught up on a few simple words.  Where did he learn to read?  The majority of slaves weren't literate.  That would have been a good bit to include.<br /><br />Olivia Pope, aka actress Kerry Washington, underplays her role to perfection.  She is boisterous and self confident in TV's Scandal, but here, her hair isn't straightened and she adopts a humbler attitude.  Good acting.<br /><br />Christopher Waltz deserved the Oscar for his portrayal.  He is magnetic on the screen.  And...please...does Samuel Jackson HAVE to be in every single high-profile movie?  His role is interesting, however.  Almost an equal to Leo....his advisor...and that relationship is not exactly fleshed out.<br /><br />So many older stars in cameo appearances.  Made it fun to pick them out.  All in all....a really good movie, but a bit bloody.  Wonder if there will be a sequel...like Kill Bill to Pulp Fiction.  I'd watch it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is the best app ever.  it ls absoulutly awesome there is so many different kinds of cars and levels witch makes it awesome. I would highly recomend this app.
B0023P1D8S|5.0|One of my favorite Sabbath albums. I also own the Sanctuary remasters of Vol 4, Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage. I found that those remasters give you MORE sonic/mix improvement. Master of Reality re-master is not much different from the original. The bonus disc is ok- the Weevil Woman tune is cool(never heard it before), the rest of are mostly identical instrumental versions- nothing earth shattering. So the record is great as everyone knows but the package as a whole(expensive) probably not really worth the $.,
B0089LOG02|5.0|My favorite part of this book was the format:  two girls, generations apart, yet uniquely connected by their experiences as orphans.  The author expertly weaves these narratives together and gives the reader a glimpse into the world of the child with no family, emphasizing how little  has changed in the past century. Coupled with believable characters, vivid descriptions, and two tales that one just can't abandon until the last page, this novel has classic staying power that will keep it in the hands of readers for generations to come.
B0063M22QO|5.0|So far it has been fun! I liked all the options you could have such as picking different background etc.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie; the plot, the characters, the acting, it was all very good. I notice it received some poor reviews due to the fact that it did not quite follow the book; a lot was left out. If you like movies like this and you did not read the book, I believe you will truly enjoy this movie.

B008BU75IQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in the series, but there was nothing to this one.  Shallow character development and storyline.  It didn't have the detail you would expect for Archer.  Seemed like he just called this one in.  Just filler to add another book to the series.

B009CRJLHU|5.0|This is a multilevel tale of a college romance between a good girl and a bad boy; it's a compulsive tragedy of the generational cycle of violence, gambling and alcoholism being repeated by two intelligent young people even as we watch. The principal characters have a presence which makes them jump off the page.<br />Travis Maddox is a walking disaster area who earns money in secret fights in the basement of Eastern University, where promoters and students bet on brutal no-rules bare-knuckle fights. Abby Abernathy is brought along by her best friend America, who is going out with Shepley, Travis's cousin. Travis gets blood on Abby's pretty cardigan and gets interested in seeing her again. She's not keen, because now she knows about the gaudy tattoos under his shirt. His nickname 'Mad Dog' isn't encouraging. Not to mention the string of cheap one-night-stands he's famous for.<br />However since Travis rooms with Shepley, America and Abby discover that he cleans up well, can hold a conversation and is a straight A student majoring in criminal law. He got a scholarship for half his tuition and fight fees pay the rest. Abby is good at math but not biology and Travis offers to coach her, nicknaming her Pigeon. She decides that they can be friends but no more. Naturally she's the object of cafeteria gossip and Travis's daunting presence ensures that other boys don't try to chat Abby up, apart from the braver Parker Hayes who dates her and gives her a diamond bracelet, earning Travis's undying enmity.<br />The amoral Travis makes a bet with Abby that if he is hit once in his next fight, he will be celibate for a month, but if he avoids getting hit she has to live with him for a month. He wins and Abby - later we find that her father is addicted to gambling, a past she is trying to escape - feels has to move in with him and Shepley. Refusing to sleep on the couch where Travis has his encounters with women Abby ends up 'having' to share his bed. She could have bought a sleeping bag and chosen the floor. Two weeks later the two are obsessed each other but Abby, even as she watches moody, jealous Travis improve the behaviour he learnt in a dysfunctional family, is terrified of getting trapped with the same drinking, violent and gambling marriage as her mother endured.<br />BEAUTIFUL DISASTER is a catalogue of irresponsible behaviour from driving drunk to causing actual bodily harm in the cafeteria without anyone complaining to the police or university. To the author's credit, there is at least one voice of reason telling a girl that it is suicidal to bet she can drink fifteen shots of tequila, and the aftermath is anything but pleasant. When Travis and Abby eventually become lovers he has nothing going for him but vigour, pleasing the lady never having been his priority; at least he was savvy enough always to use protection. I was disappointed that intelligent young people couldn't come up with entertainments that don't involve heavy drinking, but the girls are warned that drinks can be spiked. And Abby's pathetic father showing up sponging thousands of dollars from her warns of the consequences of gambling.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire has written an intense, enjoyable drama which grips from the start. As she strives for an elevated standard of English I won't hesitate to niggle; people do not shrug, nod or wink words, any more than they throw them, while a few times she uses \\"America and I\\" where \\"America and me\\" would be correct. This book deserves to be read but I would not recommend it to readers under 18, even if they had fake IDs.ng bag and chosen the floor.

B008S8PPPG|1.0|The Bass is so prominent, the listener can hardly bear to turn up the volume enough to enjoy Jesse Ware.  It's a shame the soundboard tech failed to balance the performance. Very disappointed!
B0085MK2KI|5.0|Gould delivers. Gould is always necessary in any repertoire he recorded, in my opinion. Even if he does not, with his often, eh, eccentric choices in interpretation deliver the most pleasing all around performance he helps the listener \\"hear\\" the pieces anew. That means when you go back and listen to another performance more on the \\"normal\\" side you will hear things with a fresh approach.

B00BPA6XUK|3.0|Parts of this compilation reminded me of Babylon 5, the tv series of which I have several cds. This music imho has little to no imagination, not to mention hardly any musicality. Oh well, imagine I'll enjoy the flic better. When I previewed this cd in total on utube, sounded like something I'd enjoy, unfortunately didn't turn out that way after getting it lol. Sooo... after a few weeks, listened to it again & thoroughly enjoyed it, guess rerunning Audyssey had something (or not) to do with my perception of this piece. Really liked the last track, especially the horns!

B00A8MGLAI|2.0|I love Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. I saw the preview for this film and I was thrilled. After watching it I can honestly say that it was hard to sit there and finish the movie. I get all the past-lives intertwined, we are all connected, etc. but does it have to be so boring. The Matrix was complex yet entertaining. This was just a choppy mess of ideas, some good. Anyone who can honestly say they liked this film is a fan of the ideas that it presents, not the actual production. Waste of good talent and ideas. I am very dissapointed.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I see a lot of folks complaining about the 70's groove it has going on, but I love it. Sure, it lacks the sound of electrons gratuitously pounding your senses into oblivion but there is a lot to appreciate here. Personally, I couldn't be happier.

I've seldom, if ever, learned so much from one series and particularly appreciate the insight into personalities and the undercurrents of the times.  I know we will watch this again and again, learning more each time and enjoying many evenings along the way.

1451696191|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, published February 1st, 1999, is a well-written, excellent novel that cleverly tells the exhilarating journey of growing up. The novel is written in letter format enabling the reader to observe how Charlie, the protagonist, develops as a character through his letters to an unknown reader. The components of this novel are both interesting and moving; it conveys critical messages that the reader can interpret and relate to. The journey of Charlie's freshman year at high school is fascinating with surprises at every turn. Chbosky writes in the casual yet meaningful style of a teenage boy, dealing with issues from getting a date to dances to abusive relationships; The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one story that won't be put down until the very end.<br />  The Perks of Being a Wallflower has a remarkable plot line, describing the ups and downs of high school, friends, family, and life itself. The story begins with Charlie writing a letter, \\"I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with people even if they could have. I need to know that these people exist.\\"(2) It isn't important that the person he is writing to is never revealed; it makes the actual story much more important. The reader sees how a socially awkward freshman makes his first friends, and loses some, while battling problems at home. He meets his best friends Sam and Patrick, and Bill his inspirational English teacher: three people who support, love, and truly understand him. These people help Charlie grow up. He learns to drive, improve in school, and finally kiss Sam. At the end of the novel there is a plot twist explaining in part why he struggles so much to act \\"normal\\". The complex content of this story, including drugs, romance, problems at home, and some pure joy, creates the captivating novel which keeps the reader's eyes glued to the page.<br />  A significant reason for this novel's success is the way the reader can relate to the book. From the Rocky Horror Picture Show and song lyrics to drugs, sex, and the idea that \\"We accept the love we think we deserve\\" (24) this story speaks to a multitude of people. Throughout the story Charlie reads books including To Kill a Mockingbird; which not only relate to aspects in his life, but also draw the reader's attention to recurring themes of human relationships. Chbosky craftily incorporates everyday occurrences while conveying important messages. It is these reading between the line moments, that truly create the perfect story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best ever. The best on my tablet. I was playing with my friend and it was perfect. But one thing though, what is the purpose of the Neather Core Reactor? Is there really a use for it? Other than that I love it. I wish that you could mods into it though...

B000001Y5X|5.0|I really love this cd because it was raw and it was before MM became so caught up in what he thought people wanted to hear. It was heavy but without all of the anti-God lyrics weighing it down. This album and Mechanical Animals are my two favorite albums by this band.

B00BR0SGN0|5.0|What do say about Now What??? Well, it is simply a masterpiece and possibly (in the least, one of their best) their best work since Machine Head. Definitely a more fulfilled recording than Perfect Strangers. Maybe I am being sacrilegious, oh well. I can't thing of another rock and roll recording—in years, if not decades—that is near this awesome, this inspired—this full of passion. In production and sound alone it is Deep Purple's best recording hands down. These dudes jam like it's the seventies all over. I am filled with joy by this cd. I dare anyone to name one band from the grand &#34;old days&#34; of hard rock and heavy metal that has come within light years of making a recording anywhere close to Now What. Buy it, open your mind, and be prepared to be blown away.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|What does it say about an app when the free version is rated higher than the paid version. I guess the expression &quot;get your money up front&quot; was really taken to heart. I am not sure I can add anything more than what has already been commented on by others. Do yourself a favor and do some reading.
B000007492|5.0|Blast from the past... absolutely love this, as I did &#34;back in the day&#34;!  If you liked it then, you'll love it now
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I liked the first angry birds game, and it was free.  I bought the star wars version of angry birds for my partner on our Kindle Fire, and he loves it enough to play 2 hours at a time.  The game is HUGE.  we will be playing this game for years
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|i like it because it is a challenge and you can really enjoy playing it even though sometimes its hard to play. my cousin taught me how to play this game. lool
B00BWGISB4|4.0|This cd is wonderful. Enjoying alot. The first two songs got me hooked. I will listen to more when I get back home but guys you still got it.

B007GE2H3G|5.0|My grand children were recently visiting and we had the opportunity to share this film through Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Great story - true to the popular print series. Full of adventure, &#34;scary parts&#34; and outright laughs.<br /><br />Great visual experience - the detail, clarity, and format add up to an experience to be enjoyed over and over.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next episode!
0385535147|4.0|This is/was definitely one of (if not) the most suspenseful Grisham stories. I couldn't and didn't want to put it down. It was, however, a bit unreal. It's an interesting plot and story but one that really could not have been played out. The protagonist's plan was too detailed and unbelievable to have actually been carried out. That said, it's definitely worth checking out at your local library. I'm glad I didn't spend the $20+ to buy it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Ok would recommend this book to Sheldon Staley my bff from shamrock I love it to death it Is awesome
B007ZXK08C|4.0|First the book was predictable.  I figured out pretty soon she had not been murdered. I was surprisingly sad that Greta and Jeff stole her money.  I actually felt sorry for Amy.  At the end of the novel, my thoughts ....  &#34;These two people, especially Nick are absolutely ..... up&#34;.  Amy has an excuse, she is mad.  Nick is quite sane and making crappy unsafe decisions.
B00BMUVUZG|5.0|I have loved the Theodore Boone books that John Grisham has written.  The kid \\"Theodore Boone\\" is growing up with two lawyer parents who encourage his strong interest in law.  His school friends confide in him and sometimes ask for his advice.  There are times that he has to go to his parents for additional help as was the case with this book.  Great books!  John Grisham, please keep writing your wonderful books!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just like the usual solitaire.  Nothing special but always fun to play! Would suggest for any card lover lr just need to pass time.
0679746323|5.0|A round little fellow swimming in the yellow river, and teenagers all over the world having faith in him, that was what I remembered. That he was leading a country with starving people was sad, but was it really his fault. Well, if your not sure, read this book and you will understand how little information we get by watching the news. Read it to understand how a long war can cause death and chaos for generations to come.
0152023984|5.0|Read this for the first time in French class in 1970---still one of my favorites (as was the French teacher). The secret of the fox:<br />It is only with the heart that one can see rightly---what is essential is invisible to the eye&#34;.
B00BU18U82|1.0|this game wont even download! I really want to play this game but everytime it wont freaking download! fix this
B000FA675C|5.0|I love the main character, although sometimes it can get to descriptive of the surrounding, the story just keeps you on an edge and you just want to keep reading until the end.<br />If you watched the movie it has some similarities, but just about it, some details change the whole context
B00B3HJLX6|4.0|Recorded well but not quite as well as their originals.  Very creative versions of some of the songs and very faithful versions of others.  Overall, much better than most covers albums.  A wonderfully talented group.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It continues the story from the first book, although sometimes i just want to hit Lena overall its a great story
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|Born again was the one album that featured Ian Gillen (Deep Purple) on vocals. While this album is often overshadowed by the Ozzy and Dio era albums in Sabbath's library, it contains some cult classics like, &#34;Zero The Hero&#34; and &#34;Digital Bitch&#34;. Ian Gillen's trademark scream fits in surprisingly well with the doomy atmosphere of the music. This remastered/expanded edition does sound better than the original version, which suffered from a strange murky production. The real treat for fans is the bonus disc which contains one unreleased track from the original album session and a good selection of live cuts featuring Ian on vocals. There is a nice selection of both older Sabbath classics and songs that come from the Born Again era. I personally do not know of any other &#34;official&#34; live recordings of Sabbath from this time period, so it's a welcome addition for true fans. Overall, if you dig Sabbath and you dig Deep Purple, picking up this reissue is a no brainer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Loved it on pc now my kindle! Mojang, you did great. When I got it I expected that the controls would be hard but no it's great!
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|The music in this version is so much better.  I cannot stand rap music and I don't understand why they would include rap in a movie adaptation about a book that takes place in the 20's.  This one is so much more true to the book.  I rewatched this only a few days ago and am still thinking about it.  Mia Farrow is what I would have thought Daisy to be like.  Not Mulligan who is playing Daisy in the current movie. If you are going to see The Great Gatsby, see this version and skip the one in the theatres.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|In my opinion, the mono collection is the way to go for headphones. I feel like if you want to listen to the stereo mixes, you need to listen to them on a stereo. Listening to a stereo mix on headphones, more specifically old stereo mixes, it feels so unbalanced. Having vocals, drums, or even a bass coming from speaker and not both, just seems so unnatural. Now listening to a stereo mix on a stereo is a whole other experience. The best example i can think of off the top of my head is &#34;I Don't Want To Spoil The Party&#34; from the &#34;Beatles For Sale&#34; LP. The stereo mix helps bring out the taps on the acoustic guitar during the chorus and gives it such a powerful feeling. However, this is somewhat lost in the mono mixes.<br /><br />I would honestly say that this collection is something (if your a die hard audiophile) your going to want both Mono & Stereo mixes. Each has there highs and each has their lows.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I choose this rating to this Movie due to the effect it dealt on me and others that watch it with me. It allows us to see that no matter what you do there are people that would just do what they do to hurt you for nothing, but still they are others that have best interest at heart for you and are willing to sacrifice to embrace that which is good in you.<br />I could recommend this DVD to anyone who is still stuck in their prejudice or stereotypical mentality of all colors and gender.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is definitely recommended to everybody at about 5 and up. I love this book to the max! It is very heart-warming and requires you to think about others more than yourself. To think about how others are feeling!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Our kids thought boots was funny in shrek so we got this for a surprise on our next road trip and the kids loved it.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie really touches your soul. One of the finest films I have ever seen. Pulls the heart strings a &#34;10&#34;
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Don't bother to watch this move, not his best work.  It was a waste of time, and the storyline was terrible.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Wonderful concert. A concentrate of the best music of 80s. Audio and video quality at best. But...I live in Italy (area 2) and this DVD has still the area code 1 of U.S.A. Pay attention to this otherwise you have to rip it or you must have a DVD player that accept all codes.
B0000TB014|5.0|I bougth it to remember a great pub artist , family and friends love it , specially my kids love it great product .
B00CL68NOG|5.0|great movie, I loved it...I enjoyed it very much laughed and cried...Barbra Streisand was hysterical and I surely identified as a parent...wonderful.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun, captivating, challenging and enjoyable game. I like games that keeps my attention. I think you will enjoy playing too.
B00BYISQTO|3.0|I've been a big fan of The National from the get-go, but I must admit that though I love the vocals on this album, the music is just too low energy for my tastes.
B008BM9L72|3.0|First was good, second was ok, third was s***! If I was to rate the last one it would not get a single star..
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I don't understand why a file explorer isn't included with an Android phone. I am glad to have found this one. It works well and does the job. I am glad that I discovered it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After waiting and being on the waiting list for the Kindle version of this book, I am sorely disappointed.  Maybe it's just me or maybe one must be borderline psycho to really get into this book.  After about 150 pages, I wanted to just close it and say, &#34;good riddance&#34; until someone at the local library encouraged me to give it a little more time.  There were a few times, when it was a page turner, but it was short-lived.  The book seemed unrealistic and extremely far fetched,and the ending---a major deduction in my rating.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great period piece with authentic backdrops, costumes and activities. Interesting to watch the female characters navigate the restrictions of the time in an effort to find fulfillment; not an easy task.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This book will &#34;grab&#34; you right from the beginning!!!! Definitely &#34;Stephen King&#34; ish!!! I would recommend this book to anyone. Great short story!
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|I grew up in the 80's. The music I remember most from that time are what my parents played around the house. A lot of Jackson Browne, Tom Petty, and Eagles. Stories Don't End have hints of all those artists. Very good vibes listening to this album.
B001YV5068|5.0|My husband caught part of this on TV & gushed to me how he had loved it in the theater years ago. It was unk to me so I 'Amazoned' it, ordered it (cheap!) & got it in 2 days, in time for his birthday!  He was surprised & happy.  Thank you so much!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This game starts out awesome.  The graphics are beautiful and the quests are fun.  HOWEVER, after you reach a certain point you have to pay to keep doing anything but basic actions.  (Have to have pearls to purchase items to complete tasks.)  There is a way to earn these but it is extremely slow...1 pearl per 5 days!  Items cost from 2-10 pearls!  This takes fun out of it...it would be nice to be able to earn these pearls or purchase with game money.  I won't spend $ on any game and it is about to that point where I uninstall.  If the game could be played without requiring $ I would have rated 5 stars.
B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|This one is their weakest release , but it does have a lot of great songs. It was maligned at the time in spite of great songs like 'wild child' and 'touch me&#34; a number one hit in 1982! and a top 5 hit in 69/ this has bonus tracks on it which are pretty cool. the b side 'who scared you' and the unreleased 'push push' are highlights in that regard. The cd is a mix of pop rock and rock and it's interesting but not as good as what came later.  There's a lot of horns and such in this one.  But those songs are only half the songs on here!  &#34;tell all the people' should have been a am hit single too. Morrison was of course drinking himself silly at this time and that didn't help either.  Still the cd is worth owning if you like pop rock and rock. Although some doors fans may not need this one if they don't like pop. It's the least of their efforts but it's still a very good release from the boys.
0688156819|5.0|tim burton is a great writer and artist. this book was a great read. very funny book with great illustrations
B006UG90RM|5.0|This one is filled with great metal songs that are well sung and played.  I was lucky enough to see them tour last year before , they split up again. Which is a shame because they could have made a even better cd than this one the next time around. The songs are solid , but the naysayers will point out that none of them are on the level of 'jump' or whatever.  Well that sucks for them I guess. But for me I really enjoyed this one and found these to be really good rockin songs. So if you enjoy melodic metal , which is the best kind then grab this cd. But don't expect a copy of music from 1982. It's hard and good though.
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time!  It's a must buy and must see! The best comedy
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I usually don't read this type of fiction, but I found it very engaging, which I credit to the writing. I think I finished the book in a couple of days! Quite a good read.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Totally Loved this movie. A Zombie horror film set just around the time of the ending of the Civil War. A Great story line and excellent make-up and FX. You almost feel like you're there in some scenes and feel the inetnse sorrows felt by the characters, in the movie as they have put loved ones out of their miseries and try to carry on to find an end to this epidemic. And an end to a Insane General and his troops that try to end the epidemic in his own twisted way that gets horendez results. Will the dead ever stay dead or will they just keep coming? AAA+++
B00821OX98|4.0|Great series can't wait for next season! So glad I took the time to check it out, I was hooked from episode one
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Malcolm McDowell is very impressive as the twisted Caligula Caesar. He is so very talented. This film takes you on the tyranny ride that Caligula put his people through for his entire short lived rise and fall of power. It shows how truly arrogant and brutal one person can be and what it takes to put that person in power of an entire empire and how his fall can be just a brutal, but a well deserved fall it was. A Classic Film that never gets old, just better with age. AAA+++
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek 2 was awesome and spectacular, but close to its original of Star Trek (2009).<br /><br />The cast especially Cumberbatch as Khan, was awesome, funny and brutally serious.<br /><br />Action is fun to watch, it always makes sure humor and emotion is involved<br />during any course of action.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get my hands on this Blu-ray whenever it comes out probably after<br />the summer. Too bad my wife does not like Science Fiction, but hey I love<br />the younger version of Star Trek!! it works like a charm, even though the old<br />Star Trek movies weren't all that bad......<br /><br />Live long and prosper!! Highly recommended to watch AND own this wonderful<br />piece of filmmaking history!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The Expendables 2 is Chuck (Norris) Full Of Action and Over the Top Fun yes we even get a couple apperances from The Lone Wolf himself. Everything you could want in a Guys Action Film Fights, Battles, Big Guns, and Even Bigger Ego Action Stars. Gotta Love These Shows and Can't Wait for #3.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|Useful in so many contexts, from romantic relationships, to work, to political struggles, and even to relating to yourself.  Highly recommended!
B0088X7YMS|4.0|I myself prefer the live action Starship Trooper movies but this CG version didn't let me down. There is a lot of cool action that would be almost impossible to do with live action characters and some pretty intense scenes and of course you can't forget those Damn Alien Bugs. The Mercs Continue The Fight to irradicate the bug invasion.
B008J34466|5.0|My Cd was here in just a few days plus I could download it listen to it right away. Thanks for great service
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It has been a long time coming but this team up is finally here. Captian America, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Black Widow, and Shield team up to take on Loki and some almost unstoppable alien forces. Special FX are Amazing!!! The actors portaied that Heroes and Villans like they really were these Heroes and Villians very believable as the characters. With Two Great Ending Spoilers. Leaves you over excited knowing that the sequil is already in the talks and in in the works can't hardly wait for 2014. Bring on any and every vilian out there and The Avengers with show them who is boss and put them in their place. AAA+++
B005IQZB14|4.0|Terrific read detailing journal memoirs of author's, solo 1100+ mile trek along the Pacific Crest Trail at the age of 22...the things she saw, people she met, fears she faced, hardships she overcame, decisions she made and the effects these had on her life, emotions and view of self. She started an unprepared young girl who had just lost her mother and emerged a self confident, self sufficient and self satisfied adult. This is one of the best books I've read this year. And one I will likely read again. Unlike other highly rated and recognized books I've read recently, I feel this one delivered on the high ratings and deserved all of the recognition and awards it received.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|A Great Batman film with a couple of twists you just don't plan on until it is already happening. A good ending to an awesome trilogy,........ Or is it? It is left with an open ending which could go a few different ways I guess only time will tell. AAA+++
B005URRCUY|3.0|There is only 2 good songs on it the rest is horrible , i would not reccomend for others to buy if you want the only 2 songs by the mp3 version...
B001MEJY8W|5.0|A story of horror, terror, torture and torment that makes you feel like you are right there with these girls. Vengance and retribution is what they are after until they find out that it was much more than they thought and thats when it all goes crazy. A very well done foriegn style horror film, a must see. But beware it is very graphic. AAA+++
B009OYSFDM|3.0|Plot and story line are just okay.  I mean come on, the main character uses a bow and arrow to fight and kill gun toting criminals and assassins.  If you've watched everything else and are bored then give this a look, or better yet go read a book or get some exercise. I don't see this being more than a two, maybe three season series, because it has good moments but it also has really bad ones as well.  The actress who plays the Jewish computer savvy sidekick is my favorite character, she rocks.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|KISS may have the new line up but with this album they did a good job of reverting their sound back to the glory days. A lot of Monster has a late 70s and very early 80s sound to it which I Totally Love. I am a Pretty Big KISS Fan and there will never be music like it was in the 70s when KISS was still showing where they were coming from but this cd really tried to make it back in a musical time machine. Definitely worth checking out whether you are a KISS Fan at Heart or not. AAA+++
B009R659L8|4.0|This is an intriguing family drama about sisters raised by their father after their mother, uncle and several others were killed in a boating accident.  Their father is a reckless, spendthrift who is running out of money as the family business of reproducing fine antique furniture is going downhill.  The older sister is injured in an explosion at the family warehouse and the whodunit starts from there. There are several mysteries swirling around the family and their employees and one big twist that is kind of easy to see coming but a good one nonetheless.  The writing is standard Mary H. Clark,  the characters are interesting and well drawn, the plotting keeps the reader's interest by adding new possibilities, twists, crimes and victims at every turn.  Fans of this author will enjoy this story as I did, she's not breaking new ground but can still be depended upon for a good, solid, entertaining story.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Yes this is another remastered version of KISS' Destroyer album but it was done with some Awesome Class. The sound is Amazing but what they did with the inserts and art work is work the money just to pick it up. The label on the cd itself is the old Cassablanca Style Label the disc is a black cd which in itself is pretty cool making it look even more like a small record lp, and the artwork and new photos are excellent. Takes you back to the days of the 70s when music had feeling and the artwork of the album was just as important as the music. A Major AAA+++ on this release and hoping they release more of the old KISS albums like this. Again AAA+++
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In what can only be described as a sumptuous nod to the BBC series &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; that captivated audiences and stole ratings in the early '70's (1971 to be exact), Dowton Abbey is a vivid, lush, beautifully rendered portrait of a bygone era: of men and women of substance and means, and of whom we will not see the like again. Breathtakingly beautiful, every frame reminds one of the works of portrait artist, John Singer Sargent, indeed, his works may prove to have been the inspiration for the careful art direction. Downton Abby isn't simply a window on the wealth and society of old monied England, and peripherally, America, but it is an honest representation of all that was decent and fine in these Lords and Ladies whoes privalege was never taken for granted, and whoes sense of responsibility bade them care for their fortunes for the fortunes of so many others depended upon their kind and faithful stewardship. In this series, destined to be an instant classic, no stone is left unturned in every minute detail of costume, furnishing, language, wit and scathing criticism. Though lofty, the gentry are human and, if pressed, quite kind. What is fascinating is how disapproving the majority of well-to-do become around, what we would consider to be, the vulgarities of 'new money', or, in this case, newly aquired old money. Downton Abbey is a must see, as it reminds the viewer that, far from stuck-up elitists, these men and women were the substance of the bond that held the Empire together. Insightful, riviting, suspensful and peopled with well-rounded brilliantly crafted characters, Downton Abbey is sure to make it into your DVD library.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|I rate this one of the finest films I have ever seen,  Yes ever!  And I have been around a long time.  Prior to seeing The Reader, I always felt that Kate Winslet was just an average actor (hated her in Titanic).  With this film she ranks with the best.  The film takes many twists and turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  The first half of the film is sensitive and beautiful with cheerfulness and fun.  The second half blows your mind, it almost is a different film and is very emotional with many excellent actors and the writing is marvelous.  You will watch this film over and over.  I have!
B000YHG72E|5.0|I gave this to my nephew and he loved it! I took him to the play that was traveling to my area and surprised  him with this movie to make it a theme gift!
B0008ENIAC|4.0|The original Mildred Pierce is truly a classic.  Even if you are young but love movies you will feel the tension and anger between Mother and daughter.  This film grips you from beginning to end and you are not sure what direction it going to take.  Joan was a &#34;DIVA&#34; of an era, long gone.  This movie is the finest of its time and class, and Joan Crawford was the best (along with Bette Davis).
B008HK3XYK|4.0|It is awesome. It allows me to handle my Kindle easier. It protects the device and is attractive. I give it four hallelujah stars.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|When accidently getting in on the first episode of Season 3, I was so captivated with the story and the characters that I immediately ordered Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD to catch up on the story. I also order the DVD \\"Secrets of Highclere Castle\\" with current owners George and Fiona Herbert, a.k.a. Lord and Lady Carnarvon, where this PBS special presents a virtual tour of the actual castle where the series is filmed. After quite a number of my friends saw one of my DVD episodes, they then had to order their own sets since watching them over is as great as the first time. We have unofficially become a \\"Downton Abbey\\" friends club of our own where we enjoy discussing EVERY little detail and nuance of the show as well as each of us love to predict the next crisis or dramatic event. Hope this series runs for a record time on TV. I (of course) have pre-ordered the Season 4. IF POSSIBLE, I WOULD GIVE IT 20 STARS. LOVE IT.
B00CITOS4A|5.0|(I bought this book as soon as it appeared and the initial release had some problems with the text in hint and tip boxes being displayed black on black.  As at 19 June 2013, this has been fixed - and one of the joys of the Kindle system is that the updates arrive automatically on your device.  Very happy!)<br /><br />Scott explains his approach early on:  \\"The idea is simple: You and I are out on a photo shoot.  While we're out shooting, you have lots of questions, and I'm going to answer them here in the book just like I would in real life - straight and to the point, without teaching you all the technical aspects and behind-the-scenes technology of digital photography.\\"<br /><br />In other words, it's like a giant FAQ.  If you want an in-depth explanation of the exposure triangle, this is not for you.  But if you want a great, easy-to-use, amusing to read reference that you can consume in bite-sized chunks, this is for you.<br /><br />Great stuff!
159420411X|1.0|Very one-sided take on the global warming debate.  Why did the author not interview some of the scientists and statisticians who question the work of Michael Mann, Gavin Schmidt, and James Hansen?  Steven McIntyre would have been a good place to start.  McIntyre would have actually talked about statistics, the presumed subject of this book, not \\"street fights\\".
B001KZVQJI|3.0|I am writing this review about the HD Blu-Ray DVD.  This is not a review of the movie itself.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one of the best action films of all time with some scenes that are downright epic in their scale, imagination, and heart-pounding action.<br /><br />I truly love this movie.<br /><br />That said, I was slightly disappointed with the Blu-Ray.<br /><br />***** Slight Spoiler Alert *********<br /><br />The humans in this movie interact with a variety of creatures and some of the most dramatic scenes involve the danger presented by the creatures on Skull Island.  In the theater, the CGI was completely believable.  It looked real.<br />On the HD Blu-Ray this is not the case.  At times it's like watching the old movies when the characters drive and it's obvious the cars moving behind them are on a screen.  The dramatic effect is severely lessened by the fact that the actors and the creatures appear to be on two separate planes and the creatures look clearly \\"drawn.\\"<br /><br />I am not sure if the standard definition DVD would eliminate this problem and recreate the experience that audiences had in the theater.  I haven't seen it.  I'd be curious if someone else has seen it and could comment.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough but I am hesitant to recommend the HD Blu-Ray.  I'd want anyone who sees this movie to have the same amazing experience that I did when I saw the movie for the first time.  Perhaps look to the standard definition DVD for that.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|Great movie for ESL high school students.  Funny, motivational film.  Great for literary analysis of character development.  It never gets old!
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|Once you get past the secret about the singer, you appreciate everything about the songs, the lyrics and the arrangements. They sound like.... well they sometimes sound like a number of different singers or groups but I find that it's better not to compare. Just listen and enjoy.
034580404X|4.0|Definitely a naughty read...good buy. Had heard many mixed feelings about the 1st novel, but you have to be in the moment to read and enjoy...not in a &#34;bubble.&#34;  Wakes your inner sexual goddess.
B000HIVO64|5.0|If you really like Odelay but find the disruptions somewhat annoying, this may become your favorite Beck album yet. All the songs are good & the genius apparent in that earlier album shines here yet more clearly & developed - and without the adolescent audio, mind-screw jokes.  Also includes a DVD with videos of all the songs. The mature Beck at his best!
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Great characters, follows somewhat the story of Nicholas Flamel.  Can't stop reading until you have finished the book, could not wait for the next book.  Bought the new book same day as I finished this book.
B008D37J6O|1.0|Keep crashing on kindle fire hd 7inches, and lagging a lot when playing normal video clip .mp4. Pls fix it.
0451169514|4.0|Thorough enjoyment from the book but I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it just as much at half the length.  King seems to have pulled all stops to maximise the number of words between the covers.
030758836X|1.0|This novel starts well with a premise that is suspenseful.<br />But by the end, I was completely snorting and guffawing at<br />how absurd the whole thing is and what a moron I was for<br />falling for it.<br />Sure, much of the writing is tight and just swell.<br />But the manipulation of the reader is unforgivable, and<br />the number of reviews this book got! Someone either has a TON<br />of friends or a lot of time on her hands for this many positive reviews<br />for a mediocre novel.<br />Don't read Sharp Objects. By chapter four an astute reader will yearn to<br />use sharp objects on herself.
B005FPT51K|4.0|I was interested in purchasing this monitor because my previous monitors were bad. This one is ok but still lacks some features that are important for this type of product. The microphone is weak so you cannot hear well what is happening with your baby and you cannot speak to him because there is no built in speaker. Besides that is ok.
1594744769|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading 'Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children', right up to the last page...then I felt lost.  I don't like the trend of some fiction authors who leave their readers with so many loose ends at the end of a book. Such stories should have a warning label that reads: \\"Caution! This story is part of a multi-book series yet to be written.\\" I found Mr. Riggs' style quirky and intelligent, but the ending was vapid.  The characters literally disappeared into a fog.  I had hoped that he would write a sequel, but so far, like other readers, I am left to imagine the story's continuation on my own.  I am reading for pleasure, not for a book report grade.  So, finish the story, please!
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Nice documentary about bodybuilding in Arnolds earlier years.  I think the film was set up but It doesn't take away from the information.  Poor Mike Katz He is not that silly of a person.  This was a vehicle to promote Arnold more or less at Lou Ferrigno expense.  I recommend it if ur interested in historical bodybuilding.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I really like this app mainly because i can sync it to my phone,computer,and kindle its easy to use. can be set up to pull up your daily to list and appt ect. must have app
B005S9ELY4|4.0|Great cast although a small part for Emma but the real story was about the men!  I would recommend this to other if you like violence with a story.  Sean Penn plays a great gangster.  He has gotten better as he has gotten older.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book isn't about burning bras or foregoing dresses. It is a motivational book with real stories and helpful perspectives
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Here a movie were a women beats the living daylights out of her A=list cast.<br />she is a real mix-martial artist so not much acting.  But she fun to watch and the pacing is fast & furious. I recommend it.  Especially to women who like men getting the( blank) kick out of them.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I read this book in just a few days. I thought that it would be a nice easy read, before I settled in for the evening. But it turned out to have more content and substance. It was not just your typical love story. It had the love story aspect, suspense and thriller, a real page turner! highly recommend this book. One of my favorites by Nicholas Sparks!
B005LAIGLO|5.0|Very good movie.  Retired bad boy is brought back into a life he gave up.  ( which he was very good at)  Movie moves along and is enjoyable to follow and watch .Kate is his beautiful & mother to his boys.  I recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game. Love the grunting noises the characters make. My daughter loves to play this. Not much skill needed to play.
B00C061I3K|5.0|When I first heard Daft Punk I wasn't that interested. But after trying out more of their music I became a fan. I really liked how they could switch up their sound with different albums. Homework was about making music out of nothing. Discovery was about human emotion in music. Human After All was about robotic emotion in music. Random Access Memories is no different. Daft Punk is constantly changing the music world. In this new album they bring fresh, funky grooves and live studio performances. They mix these performance with electronic elements in a very tasteful manner, and the whole album just amazes me. On the track Giorgio by Moroder, a veteran in the music industry talks about his experiences and what music is. I was a little skeptical of a \\"talking song\\" but when the synth line hit me and the orchestra chimed in, I realized that Daft Punk knows what they are doing. While listening to Random Access Memories I felt many different things. Each song was a new story, a new flavor, a new world. This album is full of well written lyrics and moving music. When I read some negative reviews I wasn't surprised, but in my opinion you can't base a review of music on other songs or past music produced by a musical group. You need to listen and feel what the musicians want you to feel. And all of the songs on R.A.M. make me feel what I have wanted to feel and hear what I have wanted to hear. Thank you Daft Punk.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love the game It is awesome and fun to play and good management<br /> And it feels like your actually the mayor of the city
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It seems like the doc expounded only slightly on the metaphysical topics I mainly bought this book to read about.  I originally reserved this book at the library, and should have stuck with that decision.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Very interesting set, consists of 4 different blocks formed by small and very small parts. Plus 2 little figures of Steve and creeper. My son (he is 7) likes it very much.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Written from the heart, sharing of fears and determination to change the direction of her life without really having the answer.
0262731541|2.0|The writing style is not accessible for the non-scientist or everyday cyclist.  I like the charts and diagrams, but I was looking for something more applicable to my riding technique and its improvement.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I hate when I buy apps and then they become the free app of the day...great game though...keep these gems coming; the last good FAOTD was A Sleepwalkers Journey....I open the amazon app store once a day to see exactly what the free app of the day is and every once in a while you get an awesome game like this...enjoy it its very fun
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved each one of them.  Anxious to see the next movie!  Interesting to see how they portray events from the book!
146920231X|3.0|The reader sounds like a computerized production. The content of the book is thin: lots of stories, little actual teaching. Redundant.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|I was looking forward to this movie, but was a bit disappointed.  Watched it on a long plane trip, so I was glad I had it, but not one of Goslings best.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Possibly the best cameo ever by an actor. The scene with Bill Murray is the best, too funny. This movie has laugh's throughout it! I've watched a bunch of times and still love it!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Animation is incredible, story was \\"good\\", and overall this was a worthwhile film. Would be a good one for kids.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What a great release, the remastered films are fantastic to watch again. The extras a good but the movies are what this is about.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I first seen this Film at the Movies.  I seen it again on HBO on demand.  It is a movie that my son's and I love to watch on the weekends when there is nothing going on. Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman are great but it took everyone to pull it together and make it go over the top.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I love Mayer Hawthorne's music. Can listen to this CD over and over. Soulful music that I am happy to listen to again and again.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Great movie, seen it at the Movies and knew I had to have it for my DVD collection. This is the kind of Movie you can watch over and over again
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Love Mayer Hawthorne's music. First saw him on Infinity and was so impressed I bought this CD. I was not disappointed. Love groovin' to these soulful songs!
B000002UUX|5.0|i liked this album and i recommend it to any one who is interested in buying this album.its awesome and it rocks
B001NKI60W|5.0|It was a fun and exciting movie with just enough romance. The movie make you laugh and has a lot of high energy. I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.
B00C061HZY|5.0|This album has a mellow vibe reminiscent to the funky disco textures of the 70's/80's, but comprised in a rich, contemporary electronic experience.  This album is excellent from start to finish and listening to it on vinyl is epic; you really catch all the detail and dynamics in the recordings.  With this album, Daft Punk shifts from the intensity that was Tron: Legacy to fluid rhythms and tightly nestled textures and melodies.  Really dig the vocal tracks, too.  Favorite track: \\"Fragments of Time\\" with Todd Edwards -- the use of pedal steel on this track is exquisite.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Draws you in right from the start. Easy to read hard to put down found myself hoping for the silver lining for both pat and tiffany  very good ending  give you a glimpse into the world of mental illness
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I kinda agree on the add thing. And you get a really good background that you don't get on the free one. So I'm not really sure.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a story that is very well told without resorting to Hollywood 'flash' to make it more dramatic.  The story itself is compelling and certainly had me on the edge of my seat while I was watching it.  Ben Affleck deserves credit for pulling this together in an intelligent film.
193700788X|1.0|The series was brilliant in the beginning,sadly Ms. Harris ran out of story to tell and still dragged it on. Now here it is, a very dissapointing end of the series. The only good thing about the book is: it's over.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Thanks for an account of this mission.  Pray for the safety of all our soldiers.  Interesting and compelling work.  Worth the time.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Even since I found out that Daft Punk were making a new album, I've been pretty excited to hear it. I pre-ordered the CD and it arrived on time and all was well. After listening to the album all I can say is WOW. Really nice blend of music from DP. Super chill tracks mixed with electronic infusions give this album character and make listening to it very enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed this album and I would definitely recommend it to people. Daft Punk did not disappoint, this really is a great album to listen to. BUY IT.
B009RRIP86|5.0|This case is something that is unique and different from your every day run of the mill case. First and formost i did tons of research before buying one of these cases, and i can honestly say i am on my third computer build, and i have rebought this case every time. My customers love them, and i also use it for my person computer. It has the perfect amount of room for hard drives. fits my two 4 TB drives, and my 1 SSD perfectly. the layout is just spot on. The cooling is superb. I've never had dust problems in any of these. the circulation of air you get is more then enough to keep all your parts looking new. Its very sturdy compared to what i thought it would be. It fits perfectly on a my desk. Nothing hangs over what so ever. Even though some parts are plastic they feel very high quality. The estedic it gives to any office is just out standing. I get compliments every time someone sees it. At first theyre not sure what they're looking at until i prop it open and reveal the 2 GTX titans. This thing is a beast and i will continue to buy them. Don't let any negative reviews fool you. This case is perfect. &lt;--I upgraded from 800obsedian D<br /><br />The only cons to this case is, if you have a lower quality PSU, or Corsair PSU you may need extensions. My higher quality OCZ red led 1000 watt was more then long enough.<br />the only other downside is the lid will not close all the way. if you have a very high end video card. my GTX 690 makes it so there's an inch between the door and bottom of the case. It does not close completely. But overall a great looking case, and gets compliments everywhere
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This product will surely keep your Kindle protected, but all that added goodness does make it much more bulky. This particular case is much thicker than what I am used to from older models, but it also has more functionality. The only major drawback is my Kindle would not fit in my purse when this case is on, but that isn't a huge issue for me. It seems very well made.
0670026557|4.0|It's refreshing for an author to offer professional success advice that's based on the idea of giving instead of rising to the top through selfish ambition. Even better is that this view is backed by research from a guy who is, by any definition, successful. This is a dense book, but Grant has a writing style that flows, almost conversationally, and weaves together studies and information into one big fascinating story of some of the most successful people in numerous fields.<br /><br />Chapters include:<br /><br />* The Dangers and Rewards of Giving More Than You Get<br />* How Givers, Takers, and Matchers Build Networks<br />* Collaboration and the Dynamics of Giving and Taking Credit<br />* The Fact and Fiction of Recognizing Potential<br />* How to Be Modest and Influence People<br />* Why Some Givers Burn Out but Others Are On Fire<br />* Overcoming the Doormat Effect<br />* Why a Soccer Team, a Fingerprint, and a Name Can Tilt Us in the Other Direction
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Worth it. I am waiting for the email response, but even if it doesn't come, this was a great purchase.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The detail of his characters, settings in time and involvement with the characters was done superbly. This book was difficult to put down. I am looking forward to &#34;Sleep Doctor&#34; when it is released in late summer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you have the characters all figured out - everything changes!  I loved the twists and turns but felt the ending weak. Still, overall, I really enjoyed the story. Don't start reading unless you have some time to read awhile. You won't want to put it down.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I got this to compare with another weather app to get a more accurate picture for my husband. He's in construction and the weather really matters. This app gives lots of details and everything is right up front- easy to find. So far its been really accurate.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I paid almost five dollars for this off amazon,  and it was painful to watch,  impossible to keep up with plot,  didn't even bother to watch the last 10 minutes,  by that time I didnt care how it ended
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a typical hidden objects game. I like that there is a story in it. It's not as good as some other G5 games though. Several times the objects were hidden in dark places and impossible to see.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the second novel better. The sexual episodes were less graphic, which doesn't usually bother me. For some reason, the 1st book was just too much for me. I nearly didn't read the 2nd novel because of this. But, it drew me in. I needed to find out what happened with their relationship. Now I can't wait to read novel #3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The boys love playing this game.  They play this more than any other game.  We spend a lot of time on the road and this occupies them for hours.
B0063M22QO|4.0|After finally understanding how Mahjong works, I began to really enjoy the challange. I tend to find it stressful trying to beat my own time. Good mind exercise.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  Funny and touching.<br />My experience with streaming from Amazon is hit or miss, it often gets hung up, you can't go back a scene.  Grrrr...really wish they would work on that or charge less until they've worked out the kinks.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|My first experience with Bukowski. I was not disappointed. An awesome story about a bitter, rebellious kid that holds nothing sacred and isn't sure why. I likened it to a darker, mature themed &#34;Sandlot&#34;. The protagonist is relatable and represents what every boy strives/fears to be. Excellent read.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|I reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in being healthy without having to constantly count calories!  I found the research and science behind the theory compelling and I find the Fast Diet regime easy to adhere to.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|This movie was action-packed and cleanly set up for the third movie without being pointless. I recommend it to comic movie lovers and non-comic movie lovers alike.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|expected more but still a good book. can be a relatable book for a lot of people. was hoping  for a plot twist
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great time killer and really fun too. You totally vet caught up in the game. the graphics are really cool too.
B008MM9630|4.0|i absolutely love this game. it keeps me busy and its fun. i love how its real time. i recommend this game to all.
0316187216|1.0|I confess, this book probably deserves 2 stars, but I just couldn't pass up on being the first 1 star review. Its difficult to judge the actual quality of this book, because really I'm just comparing it to all his others, which set the bar pretty high for me. I'm a huge Joe Abercrombie fan. I won't say this is a bad book necessarily, I will say it was a HUGE let down. Joe is way better than this. If this had been the first novel of his I had read, I wouldn't have read another.<br /><br />First of all, the western thing just doesn't work, and bothered me from start to finish. Joe just kind of dismisses the 500 year time differential between medieval and western periods, which would have been fine, had he not awkwardly placed characters from the other books into this one. Characters that we know and love, who lived in a medieval setting, suddenly find themselves wearing trench coats and cowboy hats, driving wagons across the plains, and having duels in the muddy streets of saloon towns. Picture Aragorn and Legolas carrying six shooters, and wearing spurs, and you'll feel what I felt while reading this book.<br /><br />Second, Joe adheres to the Western genre discipline of shallow character development, at the cost of losing some of the best original qualities of his writing that REALLY set his books apart from most others. (If you don't want to know what characters have returned, skip this paragraph). For instance, instead of characters being complicated, human, and unpredictable, they are know iconic versions of their former selves. Logen is Clint Eastwood now. He stares death in the face and takes on armies at a time, with a grin on his face. He holds grown men off the ground with one arm, goes into Hulk mode on command, and stares into a lot of sunsets. Shivers is about his equal, holding men hostage with one hand, while eating scrambled eggs with the other, all while delivering quick witted one liners. I miss the days when Shivers and Logan knew that even a weak looking beggar in an alley could be a force to be reckoned with in disguise, because looks could be deceiving, etc. I miss the caution, and the fear, and the human emotions of these characters. I miss them NOT thinking that they are invincible. It really just made for a lot of eye rolling on my part. And sadly, or maybe for the better in this book, we don't get the first person view from Shivers or Logen. They both take a back seat as supporting characters.<br /><br />Third, the book is just plain boring. I mean really boring. The characters spend the first half of the book traveling with a wagon caravan across the plains (headed west to find gold no less), trying to avoid Indian attacks. Yes, you heard me right, whooping, arrow shooting, face painting, plains Indians. Except for some reason they are Ginger? Short of a single Indian raid, which yields a few stray arrows and a death or two, and a high noon brawl, I don't recall any real action until the stack of pages in my right hand was getting pretty thin. And when it finally came, it was less than suspenseful. Also, Joe seems to commit most of his energy to describing how dirty everything is, almost like he's trying to convince us that we really are now in the American West! The towns are muddy. The wooden buildings are covered in dirt. Dirt caked on faces. Dirt under fingernails. Dirt clouds hovering in the air. Dirt, dirt, dirt. I get it! You're in Arizona! Less dirt, more blood please!<br /><br />Lastly, the book is painfully predictable. Everything that happens you see coming. Every line that's spoken is witty, cutting, and defiant. Every character is a John Wayne version of their former selves. Good guys win, bad guys lose, blah blah blah. This is true western, in all the worst ways.<br /><br />I caught myself sighing often, either from disappointment or sheer boredom. I even caught myself skimming at some points. I NEVER skim Abercrombie. I knocked out his other books in as little as 5 days, this book took me almost 3 months. I couldn't subject myself to more than one or two boring chapters at a time. I pressed on, because I was hoping Joe would pull through, or maybe I just felt I owed it to him for writing such incredible stuff in the past. Either way, this book was work. After finally finishing, I immediately picked up The Heroes, to flush my head of this experience, and remind myself why I love this author. I almost forgot..e almost 3 months.

B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This is a great album! Their sound has grown along with the \\"kids\\" (being men now). They seem more talented now than ever. They sound great and their songs are definitely up to date. I expected to hear maybe two or three songs that were good, but I love ALL of them! Any of them could have radio airplay and would have today's sound! SO GLAD THEY ARE BACK!!!
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|Great movie with an excellent story!! It really points out the hardships the submariners endured on both sides of WW II.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Whether you are an introvert or not, this book is well worth reading. It highlights the introverted skills that all of us need to develop. Our society already is clear that we all need extroverted skills!<br /><br />And an absolute must read for anyone with a child who is introverted.
0062059963|5.0|The Good: I adored The Selection, but was wary that The Elite would fall into the same trap as most YA dystopian trilogies where the characters escape the confines of the society we experienced in the first book and the second book is filler that takes space as we await the epic conclusion. The Selection was the complete opposite of everything I feared. The society remains, and while there is distention and turmoil in the world obviously leading to a showdown, the contest for princess continues unhindered. As America starts taking the contest more seriously, you start to like her all the more. And feel for her, because she's finally in the position the other girls were always in - caring and not knowing how Maxon ultimately feels about her.<br /><br />The Bad: The risks America takes with Aspen are ludicrous. That they continue after seeing what could happen if her actions were revealed is even more insane. It's the one point in this whole trilogy that I just can't wrap my head around.
B008602KQI|4.0|This was an entertaining and thought provoking movie.  Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrison were terrific, as were several new young actors.
B003VANOFY|5.0|They are gret, super confortable, a little tight but that makes them really confi, clean sound, good reach on the wireless, good battery, exc headset
B009VMN3RA|4.0|good story. shows how messed up all these movie stars and their kids are. I have read many books and they are mostly messed up. But interesting book.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|At least the cover has two great actors who usually make wonderful films.  This is not one of those wonderful films.  If you enjoy jumping back and forth between five different timelines then this may be the movie for you.  I was drawn to the movie by the trailer but as I now know the trailer is all I should have watched.  Even the best make a flop every now and again.  I figured after the Matrix trilogy the Wachowski Bros had something special going on.  They did, it's called the Matrix trilogy.  Sorry Wachowski Bros, I mean Lana and Andy, or whatever you call yourselves these days.  Terrible movie.
0812983459|5.0|Reading this book gives you belief in humanity ... which is exactly what Harold Fry gets when he he is unexpectedly driven by some unknown force to take a trek to visit a woman who gave him kindness many years ago.  I love the way the book just springs forth on you ... just like the trek did for Harold Fry.  It also teaches us that it's never too late to take control of your life again ... to breath new life into yourself as well as others.  I totally enjoyed this book ... and would highly recommend it to others.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is what I expected. I had used it before, but for some reason it doesn't play on my DVD player? I put it in a computer drive and it plays just fine there. I received it in the original shrinkwrap so I don't know what's wrong with it.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I really liked the second half of this movie.  I had a hard time getting into the movie in the beginning; and think I did other things for about the first half hour or so of the movie.  However, when the story line started to focus on Bradley and Jennifer, I started to get into the movie.  By the end, I was deeply immersed in the movie.  I came to care about the characters, and (spoiler alert) jumped up and cheered at the end.  I took off one star because of the slow start, but it is a good movie.  This is a movie that I may see again just for the sheer pleasure of the acting.  I can see why Jennifer won the Oscar; she is an amazing actress.  I don't think I'd purchase the movie (I rented it), but I would definitely watch it again on cable.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It is okay for a free game but on 99 cents more you can have Mahjong that has better puzzles.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this in high school and was entranced. I have reread it several times and still see its validity.  Forget the movie...read this book. I am ambivalent about the rest of the series but this volume still has power.
0307887448|4.0|Note: No spoilers, but there is discussion of themes in general terms.<br /><br />Wade Watt's lives a life of poverty and despair, like most people in Cline's 2044 America. His escape: The OASIS, a virtual reality where he \\"attends\\" school and as the title might suggest plays video games.  The novel, however, is hardly about video gaming or the contest Wade competes in. Sure it's in the title and central to the outer plot, but not really what makes this book tick.<br /><br />Where the novel shines is it's tackling of more consequential themes.  The novel deals with the omnipresent coming of age story. However, it put's it in a completely new shell: Wade must navigate the divide between reality and virtual. It's a theme not tackled before, and for that credit is due. It also takes on, through the course of its 372 pages, the issue of dystopia, though more specifically corporate power and it being a substitute for government power.<br /><br />While not set in the 1980s, the real life references and allusions Cline inserts nearly all come from that decade. While readers who are versed in 1980s culture may enjoy some sentimentality, Ready Player One is such that no prerequisite is required. Cline provides enough to give the reader a foothold on the world Wade lives in. It should be cautioned, however, those who cringe at constant references to gaming should probably avoid this book. Those who are inclined or neutral should take on this work for it's other offerings.<br /><br />Ready Player One's problems are for the most part stylistic. The novel is not going to give you any literary gymnastics, and it's hardly groundbreaking in its structure. Also its pacing at times can be slow.<br /><br />While Ready Player One will probably never become a seminal work like Catcher in the Rye, it is worth a read and you don't need to hail from the 80s to enjoy it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|A highly recommended game for an American patriot or anyone that enjoys a good military game.<br />They are always adding new buildings and units.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show, everything about it is great. I started watching season 1 a few days ago. Only downside is I am going to bed very because I can't stop watching this show. Yes its that good.
B004AOECUG|5.0|Do not think twice about buying this great BluRay. It's full of bonus features and has some actual footage. Buy it!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love playing this game it different levels and you get to build up the different<br /> Section of the adventure parts
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This a very nice game for the Kindle it's a first person shooter and it has awesome graphics for what I paid for.
157421327X|1.0|I am severely disappointed with this book. There is no reason for this random compilation of words about zentangling to have been published. I expected ideas for zentangling, &#34;how-to's&#34;, explanations, or anything useful and none of these things were present in this book.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I also bought this for my new Kindle Fire HD 7\\" and it is absolutely perfect in every way, not to mention beautiful.  I don't understand why they say it doesn't fit.  I love it because it is exactly what I want, a nice functional cover, not a cover that turns into a stand.  It is also very comfortable to hold and read.
B00ALYY6ZA|2.0|Dont waste your money. You can find recipes on-line, and the scientific data is either lacking or dubious.  Watch you-tube and get ideas from real people.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I only caught the shield in it's third year. I am now watching it from the beginning and find every episode as riveting<br />as the later ones. It explains a lot of the friction between Mackey and Aceveda and how Mackey came to become more corrupt and evil as he tried to avoid being caught.<br /><br />For anyone who is into suspense filled action crime dramas, I strongly recommend this show. For those turned off by gratuitous violence, I'd say to find something else.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Fascinating from start to finish. It is hard to describe the emotions this book brings.  It is a documentary to the evil and the humanity ingrained in humans.  You MUST READ this book!
B00A1AD6ZU|3.0|I love Rollins' books!  This was good read but was too long and lost my interest so I started flipping pages. Otherwise I would have given four stars.  I love long novels but not when they feel padded and start dragging out.<br />The characters were great, fully developed.  The science and history was fascinating.
B0063M22QO|5.0|GThis is a terrific app. I have been a fan of this game for several years. I have bought .a few of  your other manning apps also. They are more challenging. Maybe I,'ll  Be an expert  when. I,m done...;)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is so fun.You have to try to control the brake and gas at the same time.You just have to focus and get it just right.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very well written, about an unusual subject. Thought provoking. Though I don't agree with all that happened I appreciated the author's meticulous, unusual characters and how they developed. Great, gripping, emotional read.
0670026603|5.0|I laughed, cried, debated and sighed throughout this book. Haven't read a story that has moved me like this in a very long time. I keep going back and re-reading sections. Thank you for such a heartbreakingly beautiful story.
0765325950|5.0|I've been waiting for years to finally finish this series. I was not disappointed at all! I'm going to have my husband read the series so he'll know why I love it so much!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|great price
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I couldn't stop watching it, I love this show and hope they have another season. Serial killer shows are the best.
1470056496|5.0|Mansfield Park, one of Austen's later novels, though not popular with all, perfectly satisfies me as another of Jane Austen's wonderfully written stories.  Here is a summary of the plot, with a word of warning: I have left nothing out, it will spoil all surprises.<br /><br />Fanny Price, ten years old, timid and lonely, has been sent to live with her aunt and uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram, at their extensive estate, Mansfield Park.  Her cousins ignore her, and Lady Bertram's sister, her aunt Norris, never fails to remind her that she is \\"The lowest and the last\\".  Only Edmund, her older cousin, is kind and attentive.<br /><br />Eight years later, Sir Thomas and his eldest son go abroad on business, and when the son Tom returns early, he brings a friend, Mr. Yates along.  Shortly after this, Maria Bertram becomes engaged to a Mr. Rushworth.  Mr. Yates has a passion for acting, and persuades the Bertrams and the newly arrived Crawfords to put on and act in a play at Mansfield Park.  Edmund and Fanny disapprove of the scheme, and also the play of their choice, Lovers Vows; however, the aspiring performers refuse to give it up, regardless of the impropriety of their actions.  Shortly before the final rehearsal, Sir Thomas returns and puts an end to any future attempts at their play.<br /><br />Edmund is captivated by Mary Crawford, and any romantic feelings between him and Fanny seem now hopeless.  Also, Fanny has a new, albeit unwelcome, admirer in Henry Crawford.  When asked by him for her hand in marriage, she firmly refuses, but Crawford is not one to give up easily.  When she goes to visit her family in Portsmouth, he follows, and tries to ingratiate himself with her, to no avail.  Fanny is eager to be back home at Mansfield when her two month visit merges into three; however, the letter she receives, instead of inviting her back, informs her that Maria, now Mrs. Rushworth and living in London, had left her husband for Mr. Crawford, and the two had fled.  Latter, Edmund writes that his sister Julia had eloped with Mr. Yates, and they had gone to Scotland.<br /><br />Soon after, Fanny returns to Mansfield Park, and Edmund, disappointed in the lax manner that Mary Crawford treats her brother's infamy, has broken ties with her forever.  Mrs. Norris, not wanting to be separated from her still dear Maria, relocates from Mansfield, to everyone's mutual satisfaction.  Edmund realizes how important Fanny has become to him, and they are soon united in marriage.<br /><br />Many have criticized this book as not being as good as Austen's other works, and though the heroine may not have the same traits of the others, that shouldn't make the story any less enjoyable.<br /><br />Some complain that Fanny is \\"priggish\\" or \\"too timid\\" or \\"not human enough\\".  Personally, I do not see Fanny as priggish, only very upright in all her doings.  True, she is timid, but she rises above that and by the end of the book, seems much more outspoken. I really don't see how Fanny could be deemed not human enough, she seems very human to me; perhaps it is because she refuses to lower her moral standards that she is termed such; to me, this only raised my opinion of her.<br /><br />Mansfield Park is now one of my favorite books by Jane Austen, why it has not enjoyed as much popularity as her other novels is beyond me. Hope you enjoy it!
B00BZODDYU|4.0|I love scary movies and this was a good one.  I ordered it on my kindle and didn't have any trouble watching it at that small kindle size on an airplane.
B00C061I3K|1.0|This album is just very bad. I used to be a big fan, but no more, too disappointed.<br />I lost 10 bucks.
0553382152|5.0|If one were to read the past comments w/ discernment, it is easy to see that the people who do not like this book or rate it poorly are those that believe in the paranormal, the abstract, and simply are not able to accept certain \\"Truths\\" in their hearts. Christ knows this. He knows the hearts that will accept Him and knows those that won't.<br /><br />To me, this book answered a lot of questions I had from Holy Scripture. Still, Scripture is my buttress, the only Truth, that is. I just recommended this book to someone in my Life, who lost a husband, who said \\"I don't know that there is a God\\". This is a good step to learning the Truth and providing framework to begin studying God's Word, if it is God's will that you will BELIEVE. BTW, I don't believe in organized religion....I believe it is all man made and we are living in the Apostasy, where no Truth (other than the Word of God) can be found on Earth.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Works great and as described.  I highly recommend this product and would by another anytime.  It is just as described.
