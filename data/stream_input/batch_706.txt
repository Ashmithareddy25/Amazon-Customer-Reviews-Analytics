B000SM7QUC|5.0|The Heroin Diaries is what's missing from modern rock music. James' voice, DJ Ashaba's guitar and Nikki's lyrics & bass really make this album come to life. In ways it reminds me of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The opener, X-Mas in Hell is really strong, as is Life is Beautiful. The whole album is very ambitious and progressive. I wish more bands today had this kind of sound.     The Amazon.com review criticizes the album for not sounding like Motley Crue. That's because...guess what..this band is not Motley Crue. And anyway I wonder how the reviewer would have gone about making hard-hitting anthemic rock songs for an album called \\"The Heroin Diaries.\\" Imagine these kind of lyrics put to the music of \\"Kickstart my Heart\\" or something. It wouldn't work. For an album about heroin addiction, you need a sound like this or else the message is lost. You've clearly missed the point, sir.     Overall, a wonderful album with a great sound. 5 Stars.

Playing the Keanu-esque foil to McConaughey's Swayze, Christian Bale returns every hardened stare, lets no machismo go unanswered, no muscle flex go un-flexed back at, and he'll be damned if he puts a shirt on either.

1559409002|4.0|Like Edgar G. Ulmer's \\"Detour\\" and the original \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" Herk Harvey's \\"Carnival of Souls\\" manages to be much better than the sum of its parts. Much of the camerawork looks cheesy, much of the acting is amateurish, and the basic logic of what's happening to church organist Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) makes no more sense than in most B-grade, on-the-cheap horror flicks. Nevertheless, Harvey (an educational and industrial filmmaker whose only theatrical film this was) shows a flair bordering on genius for poetically creepy cinematic imagery, and Hilligoss (who bears more than a passing resemblance both to \\"Living Dead's\\" Judith O'Dea and \\"Young Frankenstein's\\" Teri Garr) is extremely effective as Mary, an uptight and neurotic soul who suddenly finds herself beset by white-faced zombies no one else can see. So what if Hilligoss does a lousy job of faking her organ-playing? The image of the ghouls waltzing at double-speed to the wheezing, stinging organ music is one worthy of Murnau or James Whale. A word of caution: I saw the Rhino Video DVD of \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" and it is execrable--the print is scratched and pitted, with massive skips and gaps. If you care enough about this movie to buy the DVD, I'm certain the Criterion Collection version is the one to buy, no matter that it costs several times more than the other available versions.
0743496728|5.0|I've always enjoyed Jodi Picoult books, especially My Sister's Keeper and Plain Truth. I found Nineteen Minutes to be incredible and heartbreaking. I could not stop reading it. And when I was done reading the story I could not stop thinking about the characters. The characters were very likable, and the description was adequate, not overdone. The story seems mostly a rehash of the Columbine incident, many situation mirror things that happened there almost exactly. I don't want to spoil the ending but I will say it came to a quick end. It left out a lot of important information and didn't make sense. Overall, it was a very enjoyable read. Highly recommend.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|We are about to delve into the mind of someone who is in a life or death struggle and must make some very important spot decisions if she is to survive. Perhaps she has been drugged beforehand; perhaps she must do something unspeakable and degrading to protect someone very important to her; but she is in great danger. She must muster all of her strength. Part of her is terrified. How does she do it? How does she survive?     Lynch likes to ask this question: \\"How does he/she do it?\\" He is fascinated by the states of mind that allow individuals to behave in certain extraordinary ways in unusual situations. He wants to understand. He is very empathetic. In earlier pics, he has tried on the criminal mind: \\"How can a man brutally disembowel his wife and still look at himself in the mirror?\\" (Lost Highway); or \\"How does a woman who has taken a hit out on her lover cope with the guilt?\\" (Mulholland Drive). He gets right into the heads of these characters, to see, to show us. Now Lynch considers the victim's perspective. How does she do it? How does she survive?     The trauma is very disassociative for our heroine, like an out-of-body experience. She is frightened enough that whatever happens, whatever she does, it is almost as though she is watching someone else have these experiences. She is just with it enough to focus on certain details that might help her should she survive - what does he look like...what is he wearing...green...a green coat...the hotel room...must remember that number...where does he keep the gun...     How does she do it? Part of her just walls itself off. It is almost infantile, this part, but she will keep all of her goodness and hope and love in this place -in her \\"Lost Girl\\" -  safe from that SOB.      Part of her feels guilty and dirty. This part tells her that she is \\"bad\\" and that perhaps she deserves whatever her tormentor has planned for her. Perhaps something happened to her long ago, something she has never confronted directly, somethingthat was not her fault but that she blames herself for nonetheless.   This is her \\"Sue\\", who is also a movie character played by the actress \\"Nicki\\".    But our heroine is strong. She will overcome these feelings of guilt and shame. There is an actress she adores and admires and who always seems to pull through at the end. What would she do? What did she do in her different films, in these various roles? What has she done to hold together in her personal life as an aging starlet? What would she do in this situation?  What would Nicki do?    So scary for our heroine. Maybe it'll all end just like that grisly story, the one that scared her so much as a girl.....but she can imagine herself as her idol and maybe just get through it. And so, to cope, she casts herself as her idol Nicki.    Lynch digs right down into this character's head. Her mind races yet time seems as though it is molasses. Themes, plans, stories, fears, dreams, desires flood into and through her psyche, and Lynch imgaines them for us exactly as he senses she would, in the same seemingly incoherant order and with the same distorted sense of time and place. That he is able to do so with such astonishing empathy and in ways that touch on so many other themes - well, welcome to the world of David Lynch.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is one of those Oscar-winning tour-de-forces portraying a disabled person with honesty and empathy.  The narrator, Christopher Boone, never identifies his specific disability, though the book jacket says Asperger's Syndrome.  The British teenager sets out to write a mystery story, because that's the kind of book he enjoys reading.  The story begins with the mysterious violent death of a neighbor's standard poodle.  Chris decides to investigate the crime.  At first the objections of his father and the dog's owner seem like the understandable response to hearing that the eccentric boy is knocking on neighbors' doors.  Some novels start out being one thing and then turn into another, but this manages to be two things at once.  It's about Chris's personal growth outside his comfort zone and his ability to achieve things neither he nor his parents believed possible.  It's also about the mystery of the dog, which turns out to be a crime of passion.  Although the story is told by Chris, who explains very logically why brown and yellow foods are bad, but red foods are good, and about how sequences of red cars can forecast his day, the author does a fantastic job showing both Chris's world and how others in his world respond to him.  Having a son who gets so overwhelmed in a store that he has to lie down and scream to make the world go away, and who can't and won't be hugged for reassurance is hell.<br /><br />This would be a great book group book, a great book for young adult readers, for adults, or for anyone who wants to see the world through very foreign eyes.

0743455967|5.0|Most would agree that Stephen King has an amazing gift for cranking out popular stories, even if you're not one of his numerous fans.  Although a rare non-fiction work, this book is penned in the same no nonsense and matter of fact tone that make his novels so easy to read.  More importantly to the budding writer, it's filled with tips and suggestions as well as inspiration for the struggle of the craft.<br /><br />Broken into two distinct parts, the first half of the book is autobiographical, detailing the path that led King from childhood reader to the best-selling author he has become.  Although he drops little pearls of wisdom in this section, the second half deals with the mechanics and the craft itself.  Like a stern but loving father, he refuses to coddle and tell you it's going to be easy, yet still encourages the reader by laying out all the pitfalls and hazards he's faced and still come out on top.<br /><br />Will his methods work for everyone who reads this book?  Probably not, but it can certainly help you to find the method that's right for you.  I highly recommend this book, and keep it on my writing desk at all times as a sort of reference.  Just make sure you have room for it on your own desk!
B000QQFKYE|4.0|In an 1817 letter, John Keats coined the term negative capability, referring to \\"when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.\\" David Lynch's films have always espoused this idea--part of what makes his work distinctive is that it always leaves something to the imagination of the audience--but not since 1977's Eraserhead has one of his films embodied it so fully. At the end of its epic three hour running time, INLAND EMPIRE will either leave one in complete awe or utterly confused, depending on the viewer's particular temperament.    The first hour of the film centers around an actress named Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), who's just landed a role opposite hearthrob Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) in what director Kingsly (Jeremy Irons) assures them will be a star-maker. Things begin to go awry when Kingsly's assistant Freddy (Harry Dean Stanton) discovers that their film is a remake of a Polish production that was never finished--its leads were brutally murdered as part of a curse on the story's origins in gypsy folklore. As filming progresses, lines blur further and further between Nikki herself and Sue, the unfaithful woman she plays, until all hold on reality is lost and Nikki (along with the audience) is plunged into a nightmarish multiple reality. Throw in some anthropomorphic rabbits, a gaggle of prostitutes, a group of circus performers, and a man with mysterious hypnotic powers, and one starts to get an idea of how far this is from conventional cinema.    In many ways, IE seems a kind of evil twin to its predecessor, 2001's Mulholland Drive; both films center on troubled actresses, shifting identities and the fractured nature of the Hollywood dream machine. However, the approach between the two is starkly different. MD's dreamlike world is a function of its puzzle-box mystery plotline, intricately designed to unlock itself once the viewer uncovers the correct keys. IE, on the other hand, stands asmore of a web of vignettes interconnected by characters and themes and operating on a more instinctual rather than intellectual level to reveal itself. This contrast is largely a function of the way the two films present themselves; MD explored the lush, stylized flavor of noir filmmaking, where IE, with its handheld camera movements, lower-quality digital video and jumpy sound design (this movie plays the quiet-loud game very effectively) delves into the grittier, more visceral aspects of the genre.    Lynch's flights of style are balanced out by Laura Dern's performance, which helps anchor the vague dreaminess of the film. She embodies at least three different characters, or different identities of the same character perhaps, with masterful ability, flowing from naive to horrified to vicious (among many other modes) with an unrivaled smoothness. Even if one can't get past the director's oddities, it's not hard to understand why he campaigned (with a cow, no less) for an Oscar nomination for his lead actress. Although none of the other actors have the range or screen time she's afforded here, the rest of the cast tackles their roles with aplomb also, eg: Irons's slightly smug undertone beneath his character's enthusiastic affability, or the low-key brattiness Theroux invests into his character(s) perfectly.    Of course, that all still leaves open the question of whether or not INLAND EMPIRE is a good movie. Reviews and reactions have been clearly divisive--this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" movie if there ever was one--however, I would have to answer yes. I'm comfortable saying that for two main reasons. First, because of the arresting imagery; the transposed face on the mysterious phantom, or the jealous \\"Smithy's\\" burning blue eyes in the dark (just two of many examples) are some of the most disturbing and vivid moments in 21st century cinema. Second, because IE walks a fine line by requiring something from the audience while still giving back a certain amount of credit. There's enough within the film that it does hold together in an abstract way, rather than being a pointless exercise in avant-garde elitism, yet it's also a challenging, often frustrating endeavor, with gaps left to be filled in by the viewer's reactions, emotions and questions.    If one is comfortable with that negative space, IE comes highly recommended. If not, there's never a dearth of more mainstream, approachable films out there.

0753820250|4.0|I read The Shadow of the Wind in one sitting span on a long flight back from Europe.  I am glad that I read the book in this manner since it would be hard to pick up every few days and be able to remember the names and backgrounds of the characters.  I would liken this novel to a major symphony in a minor key. Death and a mysterious pall surrounds the characters as the novel progresses over the years.  For instance, the weather is never sunny and hot as we all know that Barcelona can be for most of the year.  It is either raining or snowing, cold and windy in almost every scene.  Mansions are crumbling and other buildings are derelict. The scenes in the hospice are straight out of Dante's Inferno.  The character development on the whole was very good especially the more villinous the person such as the police thug Fumero.  But I really never understood the allure of Beatriz, except that she really looked good in tight dresses to her paramour Daniel.  Intellectually, the novel is not in the same league as Club Dumas or Foucalt's Pendulum but there is enough literary references to make it very interesting.  It is Gothic in the best sense of the term and the plot is plausible and believable although the coincidences are at times contrived.  In several scenes and at the end of the book, the author alludes to the decline of reading books that started in the fifties with the advent of television.  As I finished the novel and looked up to the video screen I saw the image of Shrek.  I understood all too well the point that the author was making; 90% of the airplane watching Shrek and only 10% reading.  The love of books and reading is one of the central motifs of the novel.  Take my word for it, despite some of the flaws mentioned, you'll never watch a better story than you can read in this novel.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I'm not a Tom Cruise fan by any means, but I did like him in Collateral.  The teaming of Cruise and Jaime Foxx in this movie was true inspiration.  Cruise is totally convincing and effective in his role as murderous Vincent and Foxx does an equally good turn in his role as Max the taxi driver.  The two men exchange barbs and attempt to analyze one another as Max drives Vincent thru LA on his killing assignments.      The mood of the movie is intense, the soundtrack is complimentary -- in fact I bought the cd.  Anyone familiar with the work of director Michael Mann will immediately detect his artful style in this film.      This movie is suspenseful, violent, dramatic.  It also has elements of dark comedy interspersed throughout.  I highly recommend it.

B00003W8NM|5.0|When i first saw this movie, i was inspired by the scenes of the vultures torturing the young monkeys. The fact that honey mustard was used for their baptism was somewhat freightening, but the movie redeems itself when Brad Pitt (also known as Mr. Stromboli) inherits two million pounds of green roses.   An interesting oak tree once spoke to me. He held my hand. Gently. Ever so gently. And he told me that everything would be okay. Maybe it was his courage that led me to bring him into bed with me. That was painful. But his gentle caress took me to deep oceans of heavenly chocolate. The morning after was awkward. I made him scrambled eggs with turkey bacon, but he did not have a mouth. So i polished his leaves instead. Or maybe it was that he was actually a woman at heart. A purple woman.

0439813786|4.0|I was initially drawn to The Invention of Hugo Cabret by its incredibly beautiful cover, and after checking inside, I realized it was quite a wonder of a children's book. Hugo Cabret is a celebration of a variety of artistic media, with the author infusing his writing with charcoal drawings and some very interesting still pictures taken in the early part of the 20th century. It is a lovely book to look at and hold, and we read Hugo Cabret as a family, enjoying the drawings that oftentimes told the story without any words at all; however, the actual story of Hugo Cabret seemed a bit hackneyed. The story is of a young boy living alone in a train station after his parents have died. It conjures images (and there are the drawings to support it) of a young Dickensian orphan and his hijinks, which include stealing, sneaking food and being the master of evasion. The author adds his twists to the story, incorporating shady figures, chase scenes and mysterious robot-like machines, but the story falls a bit flat, and suspenseful episodes dead-end, leaving the reader unfulfilled and wanting more. The ending is sort of anticlimactic, and although Brian Selznick's heart was in the right place conjuring up this story, the story itself is the least compelling part of the book. The drawings and photos and the way they are cast throughout the story are what redeem the book. The charcoal drawings are magnificent, yet if there had been no illustrations or images at all, the storyline of Hugo Cabret would have fizzled out and would not have been engaging enough to finish. It is fun to read out loud, and children really appreciate the images; however, it's not for every child, as very young children may be a bit frightened by some of the creepy charcoal drawings and odd photos from a time long gone. I honor Brian Selznick for his creativity in creating Hugo Cabret, and we appreciated it for its grand effort and uniqueness, but I recommend it with a few reservations.

B00080ZG10|4.0|This portrait of Hughes shows him both as a forward looking genius who took tremendous chances that ended in great success and as a reclusive eccentric with mental problems.  Is it accurate?  I don't know.  I have two problems with this movie.  First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio was not convincing as Howard Hughes.  He tried very hard, but it just doesn't quite succeed.  I think he is still too young and inexperienced to really pull it off.  It's not a terrible job of acting, but nothing spectacular either.  Perhaps a very difficult role to do.  The second problem was the ending.  The movie just stopped without any real conclusion.  I guess after almost 3 hours, they had to end it at some point.  I was disappointed that they didn't follow the story on a little further and make it more of a full biography.  It would have been too long then, but some scenes could have been cut and the movie could have completed Hughes life within 3 hours.  If nothing else, the movie inspired me to want to read more about Hughes and find out how many liberties they took in the film.  Did Hughes really drink only milk from a sealed bottle?  Was he a cleanliness freak?  Did his mental illness cause him to repeat something over and over again?  How much that went on between TWA and Pan Am in the movie actually occurred?  Was Hughes a big ladies man and did he and Kate Hepburn have a relationship for quite some time, as the movies suggests?  The movie held my interest from start to finish, so for that I give it 4 stars.  Is it really a 4-star movie?  Perhaps not, but it was very entertaining and that's what movies are supposed to do--entertain you.  Hughes was such an interesting man, a true documentary biography might have been actually more far more enjoyable than this fictionalized account.
B00003BDXG|5.0|The NYTimes said this film was the \\"most radical film released by a major studio since A Clockwork Orange\\", and they were right.  This one is actually more radical, especially in the way the story is told.  While A Clockwork Orange is brilliant (and better than this film), its story was told in a rather straightforward manner.  Here Oliver Stone goes crazy with 35mm, 16mm, video, and even animation to comment on America's love of violence, and the media's obsession of it.  The film has some of the most intense editing ever, and it becomes completely surreal in the final third where it stops making logical sense and becomes something you can only experience (there was a guy who said \\"what the f***\\" very loudly in the theater during this last third).  The film is rather ugly (it was based on a script by Tarantino), but Stone makes the most of it, making it much more interesting (the sitcom parody with Rodney Dangerfield is a brilliant bit of casting) and memorable than if Quentin had done it.  There are some really stupid scenes (when Mickie and Mallory feel sad after killing a Native American, but feel no remorse towards any of the other killings), and there are times Stone overindulges himself, but it's definitely worth watching for the great performances (Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Rodney Dangerfield (my favorite standup by the way), Robert Downey Jr. as an Aussie tabloid reporter, and Tommy Lee Jones) and the hallucinatory frenzy of it all...
0743496728|4.0|Perhaps if everyone read this book, the world might be a better place?? it is impossible not to empathize with each of the characters in the book. The only reason I am giving it a four is because it is a bit slow in parts and because of the subject matter. Otherwise a wonderful book with superb writing and recommended to anyone!
B00006JIA4|5.0|I love Freddie Mercury's voice..and think he's one of the best rock band front man ever, so I bought this. There are some pleasant surprises in this collection. Along with all the classics, I was happy to hear George Michael's rendition of \\"Somebody to Love\\" from the Freddie Mercury tribute concert..widely believed to be one of the best versions of that song ever done. It's a great collection with some songs you won't find anywhere else on CD.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I can guarantee you this will be THE demo of the year, next to the PIXAR Shorts on Blu-ray.  The DVD was reference and this version will be a direct from the digital source porting at 1920x1080p with the original 24 bit audio master!      Yes, it will also be in 2.35:1 as it was in the theaters.      The heck with Paramount and their greed-based decision to go to the lesser HD-DVD, at least for a while.  Disney and other Blu-ray studios are delivering the goods.  24 bit uncompressed PCM audio on HD-DVD with high bitrate video?? HA! I think not.

0345494997|2.0|I was ready for a great read when I bought this book. I hadn't even read all the rave reviews, it just seemed so intriguing that there was this huge Frank Lloyd Wright scandal I had never even heard of. But I was truly disappointed.     This novel is trite and full of purple prose. For me, Horan never brought this love affair to life, despite pages devoted to predictable exchanges between Mamah and Frank. I wish, I wish Horan would have allowed Mamah one vice -- maybe in real life this intriguing woman was arrogant or rude or even an exhibitionist who enjoyed shocking her turn of the century neighbors. Instead, Horan's Mamah is a cardboard saint set up only to feel guilty about her children when she isn't grappling with one after another of FLW's well known shortcomings. It's a very wearisome literary device but the only real information Horan had to go on since Mamah Cheney was swept under the rug by the Victorian society she rebelled against.     For the critics, I would like to remind them that repeating the events in a novel does not amount to a review and that just because a book purports to be about intellectuals, doesn't make it too \\"intellectual\\" to criticize. The question is: How did the book make you feel? Except for the final chapters, which did have tragedy and drama, this book bored me. But then, I started it the day after I finished a really wonderful book, also about love and hate. It was The Book Thief. If you are looking for a well-written novel you won't be able to put down, read that instead.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Over the years, I've become a huge Joss Whedon fan, for his thoughtfully and intelligently written shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, each filled with gut-busting humor, smart and clever dialogue, involving character development and careful, calculated plotting.  Simply put: the man is a master storyteller.<br /><br />To maximize your enjoyment of Serenity, it is best that you watch [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]] first.  Thanks to a brilliantly written introduction, this film is accessible to everyone, but everything is enhanced if you know more about the characters' background and motivation.  Take my advice: if you're thinking about dabbling in this universe, watch the pilot episode of Firefly first.  If you watch it all in order, you will be rewarded handsomely.  With that said, if this advice applies to you and you wish to follow it, please read no further.  The less you know, the better.<br /><br />Serenity takes place about three months after the final episode of Firefly.  Mal is still taking odd jobs, honest or not, in order to keep his crew fed and flying.  The Alliance Parliament desperately wishes to retrieve River once and for all, and so they send an Operative--a cold, intelligent and fearsome warrior, devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do.<br /><br />So many story elements meant to give us more time with each character and to flesh out the story more were cut out for the purpose of making a better movie that flowed more naturally.  This movie would've been far more entertaining had it been played out longer the way it was meant to: on TV.  But all that means is that the most entertaining movie of the year could've been better if it was 18 hours long.  A lot of scenes that were cut, you can watch on this edition as well as the previous single-disc DVD.<br /><br />This movie has something for everyone.  It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's unpredictable, it even has a little romance.  What I really love in a story is the ability to surprise me, catching me completely off guard; this movie has that too.  When I first saw it, this major reveal had my jaw on the theater floor when I realized what had happened.<br /><br />Universal should've released this 2-disc set originally instead of what was released before.  While the original DVD was fine and had plenty of extras and very insightful commentary by Joss Whedon, there was still a sense that there could've been more extras.  There isn't a lot of additional features in this set, so I would have to say this set isn't really warranted.  They should've packed on a little more and it gives me pause before giving the set the 5 stars it deserves.  Alone, it deserves it, but as a second set, it should lose one or two.<br /><br />The original features are entertaining to watch again.  The Fruity Oaty Bars bit has been upgraded from easter egg to regular extra.  I get the sense that not a lot of time was spent on producing this set.  They even reuse the same music and graphics for the menus.  The box is nice and shiny, though.  It looks more like it could hold four discs inside.  That would be very, very nice.  It's still a nice set at a reasonable price that fans will buy no matter what and is a good stocking stuffer for someoene who's been wanting to own Serenity.<br /><br />Someone else mentioned that the new features are also found on an Australian 2-disc edition.  What I know is not on that version is the new commentary recorded March 2007 featuring Joss, Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Ron Glass and Summer Glau.  Normally, a cast commentary leaves you with little other than a feeling that your friends are talking over a movie you like, but Joss keeps most of them grounded and there's plenty of laughs and interesting info.  Ron is mostly quiet and Summer is adorably shy, but put on the spot by Joss often enough to get her out of her shell.<br /><br />Here's a quick synopsis of the other new features:<br />A Filmmaker's Journey - Lots of behindthe scenes bits.<br />The Green Clan - A short shout out to Jack Green, the brilliant cinematographer of the film, and the involvement of his sons and daughter with shooting and assisting.<br />Extended Scenes - You get the feeling that, if you had the previous disc, you've seen these before.  When you watch them, though, you realize that they're all new.  They aren't stuffed back into the movie, but are a separate feature, as they should be.<br />Take A Walk on Serenity - A cool short with Joss and the cast talking about the new Serenity set and the little differences between the film and the show.<br />Sci-Fi Inside: Serenity - This is just a special that aired on Sci-Fi Channel to promote Serenity before its release in theaters.  The clip of the film at the end has the sound out of sync for some reason.<br />Session 416 - Amazon says these were \\"internet pieces\\", but I've never seen them before.  They're pieced together and feel like a short film featuring Summer Glau.  Probably the best feature, showing River's sudden transformation from a bright young girl to what we know her as now.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie just kicks @ss.......plain and simple. Each line Butler gives is better than the last, the action is brilliant, there is honor, bravery, loss, courage, revenge, betrayal.......Butlers voice can be kind of stereotypical after a while. A buddy of mine has been poking fun at it with sayings like \\"SPARTANS, BE SURE TO WASH BEHIND THE EARS!!!!!!\\" But wow, what a ride this movie is. One of my all time fav's.
B000V39KDO|1.0|This movie is just pointless violence...kinda like the war in Iraq.  If you love war content with a poor plot then this is your movie.  If you love death and mayhem with no purpose then join the military and jump on the next flight to Baghdad.

B000SO7OMA|5.0|*The folowing is a description taken from Ms. McKennitt's website.     Nights from the Alhambra is an enchanting musical performance, set beneath the stars in the breathtaking Moorish heart of medieval Spain. Captured live in September 2006, singer/composer Loreena McKennitt - in her first in-concert television special - leads viewers through the multi-textured landscapes of her catalogue, from traditional Celtic ballads to literary narratives and highlights from her most recent recording, An Ancient Muse.     From August 2007, Nights from the Alhambra will be available in stores worldwide as a deluxe three-disc set comprising a 139-minute DVD and two companion CDs with a combined running time of 94 minutes. Both the DVD and the audio-only CDs present performances of 18 of Loreena's best-loved songs, including \\"The Mummers' Dance\\", \\"Caravanserai\\", \\"The Mystic's Dream\\" and \\"The Lady Of Shalott\\", performed by Loreena and a host of musical colleagues.     The live concert performances captured in Nights from the Alhambra were first seen in the TV special of the same name in PBS's \\"Great Performances\\" series. This programme began airing in the United States in March 2007.     In the spring of 2007, a version of the DVD/CD set Nights from the Alhambra was sold exclusively during Loreena McKennitt's European and North American tours. This \\"tour exclusive\\" version of Nights from the Alhambra featured different artwork on the outer packaging, but it included the same content as the later commercial release.     (I have seen Ms. McKennitt perform several times, including this The Ancient Muse tour, and this is not to be missed. If you were unable to see her during this tour, or have never seen her perform live, you will not be disappointed by this DVD/CD collection. The music and setting is breathtakingly beautiful, the musicianship is unparalleled, and Loreena is such a warm and gracious performer. I would give it ten stars, if they let me. Highly recommended.)
B000OVLBGC|5.0|My wife & I saw this on the recommendation of the ticket seller at a small theater that we go to for out of the way movies & we were just thrilled that we saw what we consider the best movie we have seen in years.  Even it being in German, with English sub-titles does not take away from the enjoyment and total involvement we experienced.  This movie makes you fully understand what it would be like to live in a society where your freedoms are basically at the whim of the government.  The wonderful thing about this movie is that you become involved in the lives of all the characters, to the point of where you really care about them.  Even the supposed \\"bad guys\\" are completely sympathetic & believable.  What was fascinating was how the main characters never meet until the very end, even though their lives are completley changed by their interaction.  In some ways it is a tragic story, but at the same time the nature of the way they finally come to grips with the system and the way it affects them, is so wonderfully uplifting.  I am probably saying more than I should say if you haven't seen this, and I don't want to give anything away.  I am not a movie expert by any stretch of the imagination and this is the first time I have written anything about a movie, but that should tell you how much I loved this movie.  Do yourself a favor, see it.  You won't be sorry.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I am loving the Arcade Fire's 'Neon Bible'<br /><br />I don't know that they or the disk have anything revolutionary to say - but how they say it is pretty impressive. Yeah - their lyrics could be deeper and less repetitive, but because of the music and vocal arrangements along with the production, those things are minor flaws.<br /><br />It can be argued they pull from many influences- and they do - but guess what? It works!! The influences are so varied and the arrangements so well put together that the disk is still extremely cohesive.<br /><br />Sure, I have favourites, like \\"Intervention\\". How is this not ELO meets the Tragically Hip? (yes, you read that right!)The pipe organ is a nice and unexpected touch. During the first five seconds I want to break into the first line of the Alarm's \\"Strength\\". But even when the rest of the instruments kick in, the organ remains a subtle, yet strong presence. But the background vocals are pretty good too.<br /><br />\\"No Cars Go\\" is Ultravox meets Big Country. \\"Ocean of Noise\\" uses the lower register of a piano and bass beautifully. It also contains a great vocal arrangement that includes \\"now who here among us/still believes in choice/not I.\\"<br /><br />The Montreal-based band (but mostly the vocalist) channels their best Nebraska-era Springsteen, albeit fleshed out, with both and \\"Antichrist Television Blues\\" and \\"Windowsills\\" (in which the last 40-50 seconds just repeats `I don't wanna see it on my windowsill' over and over - and yet it I do not find it annoying).<br /><br />They close out with \\"My Body is a Cage\\". Again with the pipe organ. I really enjoy this - where it might have been done by Beck, Arcade Fire does nicely on it, The song starts off so minimally and then becomes not quite bombastic, but could border on the overwhelming. But you have to play it loud - that's my opinion.<br /><br />Granted the entire disk is not great. I'm still struggling with the title track and \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\". But only two marginal songs off an entire disk is nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />I've played the album quite a lot and still really like it. I can't say it's a sing-a-long disk, but one could do it. Maybe it is just me, but it is great for a night time drive.at.    I've played the album quite a lot and still really like it. I can't say it's a sing-a-long disk, but one could do it. Maybe it is just me, but it is great for a night time drive.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Delightful, wonderful, enchanting, captivating.    I was surprised to see so many so-so reviews of this movie.  Maybe I was just in the right mood for it and maybe the fun I was having watching it blinded me to any shortcomings, but even though it was predictable, I still thought it was charming, enjoyable entertainment.
1594489505|5.0|I enjoyed the initial charachter development of \\"The Kite Runner\\" more.  However, about half way through this book I began to really identify with these women.  I could barely put the book down from that point to the end.  Mr. Hosseini is a wonderful storyteller, able to transport the lives of those who live so far away and make them real to the reader in an everyday sense.  My son enjoyed \\"The Kite Runner\\" and I know my daughters will want to read this book.  Can't wait for more.

B000BHN7DE|5.0|If you even like Anastacia, you really should add this 2 disc CD to your collection.  The first CD is classic and the 2nd has those wonderful remixes that are great for putting in your MP3 player and going for a great brisk walk or just playing outloud at home to dance your butt off.      Enjoy!!

B000024D4R|5.0|A prediction: In time--well isn't that time already here?-- all of Pink Floyd's other work will be divided up and bits of this will be packaged with pieces of that and then repackaged and then re-repackaged. . .      This will stay whole.       A challenge: put Animals on a player now. You won't be able to take it off.
0316168815|2.0|I'm sorry to say it... I really wanted to like this book... but I didn't! In fact, I was quite stunned to discover how disappointing and unproductive this book is, considering the number of people who have read it.  I read it on a recommendation from a friend whose book recommendations I usually agree with.  Unfortunately, I wish I had gone with my gut instinct and put the book down after getting nowhere in the first 100 pages.  Instead, I kept reading just to get through it.  I really disliked this book!  I'm not a book snob, but I like a book to be somewhat believable if the author is attempting to depict a real life scenario ie: a family's coping with the death of thier murdered child.  The whole thing, start to finish, was so contained, so picture-perfect, so annoying!!!      It's funny, the person who recommended the book to me said the hardest part of the book was the first chapter because of the grisly details of poor Susie's death.  I disagree.  Though I am not a fan of horror or even CSI shows... I at least found the first chapters suspenseful and engaging... I cannot say that for the rest of the novel!       The concept of the narrator being in heaven is definitely an interesting one, but the story she tells is so contrived and meandering and really uninspired that her perspective hardly seems special.    I think this novel has the ability to be interesting or possibly helpful to someone who has had to deal with the death of a close family member because it so plainly shows that a family falls apart around such a loss and that this is sort of a natural process.  But beyond that situation... I'm sorry, I would not recommend this book.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I rented this at Hollywood and watched it three times in five days.  I NEVER do that!  This film clicks!  As pointed out by several of the previous commentators, this film has a few flaws (Yes, that dog WOULD have been deaf!) such as when the FBI agent was viewing the video in his office, he heard the rifle shot when it hit it's target.  No Way! 4-5 second delay from that distance.<br /><br />Non-stop action and a good plot makes for a great flick.  Those sniper shots on the glacier look very close to the sniper footage you find on the web from Afghanistan.  REAL! (well, almost...)<br /><br />I also enjoyed his attitude.  Bitter for the lies.  How many will have that from this mess in Iraq?<br /><br />One last closing comment.  Wahlberg missed a great opportunity when he nailed Glover.  \\"I live...you Die!\\" would have been a great comeback for Glover's trash talk.  Oh well, I'll do it right when I direct MY film!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|An absolute Gem !!  It is extremely funny and colourful.  Have seen it now many times and I still love it.  Great for a comfortable or romantic evening at home with friends and loved ones !!
B000000P11|4.0|I don't like this album quite as much as Script of the Bridge, which grabs you and never lets go.  The Chameleons tone down the driving rock for some slower numbers here, and they're not my favorites.  HOWEVER, balancing that out are the two BEST Chameleons songs ever:  Soul in Isolation and Swamp Thing!      There are 6 bonus tracks that make an entire play-through a little unwieldy, but two of them are great:  Paradiso and they really put their stamp on Tomorrow Never Knows.
B000002JAX|5.0|....has been fulfilled....but not nearly as much as we'd like. When this fabulous album came out in 1996, it looked like we had our next great jazz star; Madeleine covered the music of Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, and Patsy Cline with style and grace...she also proved that she can sing in either English or French with equal felicity.....<br /><br />....alas, it was to be eight years; Madeleine has given us two more albums of equally beautiful covers, plus one very limited release with her then boyfriend William Galison. Madeline's personal problems have taken their toll on quantity, if not quality. The business with Galison was really sad; some things made it into the press that I wouldn't tell anybody, even in private. Further, Madeleine appears to be one of those unfortunates who do better work in the studio than in live performance.<br /><br />Forget the problems; this album is a 100% joy. I'll mention two specifics...Patsy Cline's \\"Walkin' After Midnight\\" does full justice to the original, and \\"Was I?\\" is hilarious...really catchy. You'll love this album, and, like me, you'll wish there was more.
0060578793|5.0|If you ever watch any of the survival shows on the discovery channel,  lot of whats in this book will seem familiar to you.  At the very least it should give you a better strategy then running through the woods screaming and waiting to get eaten by a bear.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|I've been a fan since I was a kid and that goes way back to the beginning.  But even new fans will get a kick out of this film, kids and adults alike.  The animation is spectacular, giving the scenes an almost real feel to them, especially the rooftop scene in the rain.  You won't see better animation.  The plot was driving and humorous and though you won't recognize the voice-over actors that did the turtles, you'll enjoy hearing them over and over again.  Chris Evans and Sarah Michelle Gellar throw in their vocal talent for Casey Jones and April O'Neil.  Patrick Stewart is delightful as Winters and I wouldn't mind hearing him do more voice-over work.    Overall, I give this film a huge thumbs up.  A must buy.
0671027344|4.0|For some reason I decided to check out the audio book for a mild distraction.  As a woman in her 30's, I was moved how the author did a wonderful job capturing the feelings of lonliness, anger, happiness, despair and the basic need of being love and loving others that most of us experience.     In my opinion, it almost takes someone with some life experiences to really see just how fragile we can be, whether it was yesterday or almost twenty years ago.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I am a 57-year-old woman who doesn't particularly like country music. But I love Taylor Swift! This album is like a book of stories that grab your heart, make you laugh, make you cry, make you say, \\"Darlin', I couldn't have said it better!\\" I don't have to relate to a story to read it, and I don't have to be 17 to recognize the sweet truth of a 17-year-old's life in these cunningly written verses. Taylor and Liz have a huge talent at the turn of phrase that captures the unspeakable bittersweetness of life. I like it that Taylor's voice is not smooth and polished, but lets the girl in the girl come through. It's all that much more believable. There are only a few CDs about which you can say, \\"I love every cut on it.\\" This is one.   Favorite cut? \\"Tim McGraw\\" is great, but I like just as much \\"Stay Beautiful\\" and \\"Cold As You\\" and \\"Tears on My Guitar\\" -- wait a minute, I could name all of them! Thanks, Taylor, for takin' me back to . . . those days.
1586217194|2.0|My sister recommended I get this product and I generally take her advice, so I jumped on this without thinking.  I am easy to please, a good story or meaningful self help idea is always appreciated.     Having said that, I would not recommend this product.  It felt to me as if the author was writing a PhD dissertation with this audio.  He went into such colorful detail on tangential themes in order to attempt to relay his points that it became difficult even in the car to sit and listen to.  His points were not that difficult to relay, but one got the idea that he had to fill space/time, and a lot of it.  That is exactly what he did.     Unfortunately, I can't even say that his ideas were very creative.  It was a serious chore to listen to the 6 or so CDs, I NEVER would have sat and read this material.     For those people that prefer to get to the meat of a subject and do not have the luxury of having immense amounts of time needlessly wasted, I cannot recommend this product.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins sets out to convince the reader that the god hypothesis is highly unlikely. Whether many readers are persuaded is in doubt. Most, like me, probably came to the book as atheists or deists of some sort anyway. The arguments seem well-aimed to convince the reader with an unformed opinion, but in all honesty that's a bit hard for me to judge.<br /><br />As a nonscientist I found the first four chapters where Dawkins explains a bit about natural selection and a dash of physics to be useful, instructive, and supportive of his 'god is very unlikely' hypothesis. He does a fine job undermining any scientific basis for intelligent design. He quotes a description of intelligent design as 'creationism in a cheap tuxedo' - although I don't know how the tuxedo people feel about that.<br /><br />Dawkins then wanders off into an unconvincing discussion of the Darwinian roots of religion, but ends strongly in examining the ills that religion brings to humans. Dawkins also provides an appropriate modicum of footnoting and a useful bibliography.<br /><br />Dawkins' enthusiasm, while refreshing, leads to an unfortunate pedantic style. If it didn't open up a big can of epistemological worms I might even he says he's preachy! High literary value is notable by its absence, but nonetheless, Dawkins does make his topic accessible and fun at times for the general reader and it is a most important one.

B000002549|1.0|I was thrilled to discover a previously unfamiliar album in the local used music store.  The price was right (I had thought), and Barbara is such a classic example of a lovely voice, she must have pushed herself into the reaches of he musical ability to sing these beautiful arias.<br /><br />Well, the music is even worse than Barbara's hair on the cover!  Each song sounds as if no thought was put into it.  My ears wanted to spew their horror as I switched from song to song.  I don't think I made it through a single piece.<br /><br />She sings these arias like they are lounge songs.  But unlike Renee Fleming in her Haunted Heart [[ASIN:B0007Z9QUS Haunted Heart]] album, she gives no thought to the appropriateness of the syle.  The harsh, heavy sound on the songs destroys the easy line.  And did I mention that every song sounds the same?<br /><br />Quite honestly, I am flabergasted at this album's high rating!  The fact that so many people can unashamedly sing the praises (only hopefully their song is much more melodic than Ms. Streisand's), only shows me that the ear is only tuned to the preferred voice, and not to the intent of the music.<br /><br />Barbara has NO business ever touching classical music again!

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends - The Complete Series Collection is defintely one to add to your collection. I never get sick of watching Monica, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey act like complete dummies. I think the show was at its best during seasons 1-6, but all 10 seasons are worth the price. You gotta get this collection if you can't get enough of your \\"friends\\" as well.
B00008MZ0N|2.0|This film seems to be very high in a glossy, shiny image but it really lacks in acting and believability.  Paul Walker almost seems like he is a robot when reciting his lines in many scenes, and his ability to strain a look of concern makes my head hurt all the more.  Vin Diesel is really no better, and even though he played a great villain in the movie \\"Pitch Black\\", his try at being a rebel without a cause/but with a cool car is stagnant.  What the film is really good at are chase and race scenes, but the story involving an undercover agent and gangs who seem invincible is shallow, hollow and downright ludicrous.  This film probably appeals to middle school kids who dream of having a souped up Honda with a fancy paintjob.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Secretary is a movie you will really like or really loathe. I am somewhere in the middle. The story of a girl who cuts herself and finds happiness in a sadomachism relationship with her pompous boss could turn most people off and I have to admit some of the scenes are pretty risque but Maggie Gyenhaal wins over the audience with her dark optimism and self-deprecting attitude. She falls in love with Edward played by James Spader, it's an unusual kind of love but it works for her, she is used to hurting herself and now she finds pleaure in Edward releasing that same pain on her. This movie is not for everyone but it is worth a viewing or two. Enjoy!
B00005R5G9|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since I was in elementary school.  Now as a young adult the story is still funny, the characters are developed very well (Hollywood and those sunglasses!), and the plot moves from start to finish.      MUST SEE!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|It's taken me two days to figure out what to type(I just left this window up) because there is almost no words to describe how great this show is. It has the COOLEST(for lack of a better word) plot line ever. From the supernatural beings to Sam and Dean's relationship, this show excels where many could not. If you like great acting, captivating plot lines, and two outrageously gorgeous men, then watch this show.  And of course, if you like seeing those two brothers kicking some butt, then buy this show because I promise you that you won't be disappointed.     My personal favorite episodes would have to be episode 6 \\"Skin,\\" episode 14 \\"Nightmare,\\" episode 19 \\"Provenance,\\" episode 20 \\"Dead Man's Blood,\\" and the finale \\"Devil's Trap.\\" And it helps that this dvd has bloopers(which are hilarious) and this segment called \\"A Day in the Life of Jared and Jensen\\" which is also pretty funny and worth a couple dozen watches.
3551551685|5.0|I needed a book in German that would motivate me to keep at it, so that I could increase my understanding and use of German.  This book was perfect.  The story was so good, I relied on context more and more, rather than compulsively looking up each new word in a dictionary.  This is how I learned as a child, and it's still a good way to learn.
0743454537|5.0|I wasn't expecting such a good read out of this book.  I thought I had read a similar book to it and so I thought it would be a nice read, but I was not prepared for what a great story this was.  Some of the story can be expected during the read, but other than that it is a good story about family, the justice and medical community with a bit of a love story intertwined.  Definitely recommend it!
0743289412|1.0|Unless the story picks up tremendously after the first one fourth of the book...I just couldn't keep going.  It's sad too, I am a Stephen King fan.
B00005JPLW|5.0|300 was everything I anticiptated it to be.  I am not a man of many words but I will say this, the movie is orientated towards both the male and female gender.  Even though it is about a war between ancient superpowers I believe every man of the 300 have 6packs which is the female attraction.  The women are hot but the various battles which take place throughout the film get increasingly better and somewhat astounding. I wont ruin it for you though, but I suggest you add this movie to your all favourites collection!!! Excellent +++++
0385341067|5.0|This novel is narrated by a black girl named Matilda who is reflecting on her time growing up in an island's small village on the fringes of war-torn Papua New Guinea. The village regularly receives news and gossip about the ongoing conflict between the perceived \\"red-skin invading government\\" and the black rebels made up of many young men from local villages. They hear about the vandalism and destruction of communities as well as the gruesome murder of many innocent civilians caught in the civil war. However, Matilda is only vaguely aware of this happening in the back ground. At first, she's more concerned with the daily details of life with her protective mother (her father left them some time ago to do business in Australia), playing with her friends and wondering about the local oddity - Mr. Watts (or Pop Eye as the children call him), the only white man in the village, who is occasionally found pulling his mysterious black wife in a cart while wearing a red clown nose. When the children are left with no teacher, Mr. Watts surprisingly comes forward to educate all the local children. However, with no formal teaching skills, he spends the majority of class time reading aloud to them from the novel Great Expectations. Matilda is enraptured by the story and comes to think of its characters as her friends, finding common themes between Pip's life and her own. However, her strict Christian mother is less than pleased about the way Mr. Watts is influencing her daughter. When the fighters come to Matilda's small village, the girl's adoration for the character Pip inadvertently causes a conflict which throws the village into chaos and threatens their peaceful existence.<br /><br />Jones masterfully re-creates life within this small village using straight-forward, beautifully-wrought prose. He describes the way in which storytelling can powerfully affect people, letting their thoughts and experience meld with the tales to make them wholly personal and unique. The author also manages to subtly make original and profound statements about racial differences. When scenes of horrific violence appear they are delivered with heart-breaking simplicity rather than artistic flourishes. Jones shows the slow painful destruction which war brings, exhausting and maiming the fighters, creating upheaval and chaos in the lives of ordinary citizens and tarnishing the future of the innocents. This is what makes Mister Pip a truly universal tale accessible to anyone. The thing which is shown to survive, beyond all the villagers' physical possessions, is their imagination and memory. They are what allow Matilda to reconnect with her past and rebuild her identity out of the ashes. She eventually discovers Mr. Watts has hidden stories of his own as does her beloved author Mr. Dickens. Though she endures a painful amount of hardship, it feels like a kind of victory that Matilda's own story can survive despite her childhood world being erased by the march of history.<br /><br />This is only the first of New Zealand author Lloyd Jones' numerous novels to be published in the UK and US. Hopefully, his back catalogue will become available to the west soon.nages to subtly make original and profound statements about racial differences.

B000BCE918|4.0|Well, Well, Well!!! Jurassic Park 1,2 & 3.  I have saw all of these movies on numerous occassions, however I decided to buy the boxset so I may watch them at my leisure.  Jurassic Park ( all 3) deserve a 5star rating but I have a reason for giving them a 4star in this review which I will explain in a moment. Jurassic Park is the result of a brilliant mind combined with modern day technology and special effects.  Its results are realistic dinosaurs in modern day and mans ability to get up close and personal with these critters. Tricerotops, brachiosaurs, T-Rex and an even more dangerous dinosaur than T-Rex whose name escapes me appears in the third.  An ingenious idea of re-awakening a long extinct species comes true which I believe may have formed the basis of many a youngsters dream! In fact, it is the youngsters that cause me to give this review a 4star.  The movies are geared towards all ages.  What is needed is a realistic approach to what a dinosaur would do when the kids are NOT watching. Please, Please, Please make a Jurassic Park with an over 18's certificate.  I bet the two kids would not escape the kitchen with the 3 raptors if it were for viewing only by an older audience!!! Even though such a movie may only exist in my dreams, for now JP 1,2&3 still amaze me. Thank you Stephen Spielberg, I cant wait to see what you come up with next!!!
0743289412|5.0|I loved this book.  It scared me, yes, especially \\"The Long Boy,\\" though I won't mention what that is.  I can say this is the best King book since [[ASIN:0451184963 Insomnia]} and almost as good of a romance as in [[ASIN:067102423X Bag of Bones]].  King himself says it is the best book he has ever written.  I think some of his earlier work is better, but I do think this is the best book written since the accident, including the Dark Tower books.  My recommendation to you:  read it slowly, at night, savor it like a good piece of chocolate cake that, when eaten at night, will most certainly give you nightmares.  Note, also, that this book is connected to the first Gunslinger book: [[ASIN:0670032549 The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)]], by the word \\"bool,\\" which is uttered in the Gunslinger by the bad guy during a bar scene.  I also think \\"The Long Boy\\" is a representation of either Flagg or the Crimson King, but scarier than either.
B00000273P|5.0|In a career that span three decades, Prefab Sprout has an extraordinary number of breathtaking beautiful songs.  Even against the backdrop of so much great music, \\"Jordan: The Comeback\\" is very likely Paddy McAloon's masterpiece.  90 years of American pop music are condensed into 19 memorable tracks, reputedly inspired by McAloon's twin obsessions of Jesse James and Elvis Presley.  At the same time, McAloon observes and comments upon the American obsession with the cult of celebrity.  And it works because all (well, nearly all) of the 19 tracks are great stand-alone pop songs.<br /><br />Thomas Dolby's production work provides just the right amount of polish.  Given that this followed the overly-smoothed, too-cute \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\" (the immediate predecessor in terms of when the records were recorded, not in order of release), that lighter touch was something that couldn't have been taken for granted.<br /><br />The party-jazz of \\"Carnival 2000\\" is good fun.  \\"Machine Gun Ibiza\\" employs a spare funk sound that is so effective that it could have come directly from Queen's \\"The Game.\\"  (Yes, Queen is not American band, but \\"The Game,\\" with tracks showing disparate influences such as Chic and rockabilly, was far and away Queen's most \\"American\\" sounding record.)  \\"Wedding March\\" is a clever bit of flapper-era pop.  The cult of celebrity is best explored in the back-to-back \\"Jesse James Symphony\\"/\\"Jesse James Bolero.\\"  The two most obviously Elvis-inspired numbers, \\"Jordan: the Comeback\\" and \\"Moon Dog,\\" also make for great listening.<br /><br />However, I could have done without the maudlin hymn \\"One of the Broken,\\" a schmaltzy appeal to help the less fortunate.  One clunker in 19 tracks is a pretty good batting average, though.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I liked this movie; good family movie that the whole family can watch. If you like \\"muppets\\",you'll like this one.
0767802659|3.0|This film may in the end prove to be almost as controversial as the novel on which it was based.   Robert Heinlein's novel, written in 1959, has been reviled as fascist propaganda, with its glorification of militarism.   While Heinlein denied this, the world he depicts - a military elite holds political power, and wages war against enemies viewed as sub-human - bears an uncanny resemblance to Nazi Germany.   The film sides with the novel's critics.  Earth is portrayed as authoritarian, although not entirely totalitarian, while military leaders are portrayed as thugs.  In contrast to the novel, war is depicted as brutal.  The brave young soldiers who are inspired by civic duty do not achieve glory, but rather die in droves and end up as decomposing corpses.  All in all, the film is a subtle satire of the novel.
B000PY52EU|3.0|Black Snake Moan was a decent film overall.  I can see where there are those who may delve deeply into the core of a message that may or may not be there.  It was a movie that I could take it or leave it.  I guess it's a movie that you either love it or hate it.  I'm stuck in the middle, undecided.  Aspects of it pulled me in. Although it was difficult to really grasp what, who, and where the characters were and where they were going.      It was not a waste of time to watch this.  However, I've seen better.
B00005ATQD|3.0|I find this movie very average.  The acting is uninspiring and the plot is pathetic to say the least.  It has the potential to be interesting, but it takes so many useless loops that in the end you don't care about the plot at all.    What makes me call this movie one of my favorites, besides the scenes of a half-nude Nicole Kidman and the steamy orgy scene, is how edgy this film is.  It has a semi-porn movie feel to it, yet you know that you are watching A-list actors like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  The movie is raw and edgy and very appealing.  If you want to buy this movie for a great viewing experience, simply pass on it.  However, if you would like to watch something original and edgy for once, then this movie would be a great addition to your collection.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This movie was Realy Good.  If I had to compare it to anything else i've seen, it would be the movie, \\"Crash\\".  Which I loved tremendously as well.  Hey, it's a great film with a full circle ending.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Ok....   so its been about a decade or so that the metal scene has been crying out for a band like this.  A lot of hype sourounded ivan and co for months before the release of the \\"5 Finger Death Punch\\" debut album.  -It dosnt disapoint!!  From track 1 through to the end of the C.D. you will mesmorised by a brutal, yet musicaly sound album!!!    This band has been true to their fans from day 1.  And the album reflects that.  A 'must buy' for any serious fan of metal!!!!!!
0385333846|4.0|To be honest, I have no idea why I picked that quote to be the title of this review.  It just kind of grabbed me.  Yet if you are even moderately familiar with SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, you probably know that any title would work just about as well as any other.  SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, after all, does cover a lot of ground.    The book follows Billy Pilgrim, a survivor of the bombing of Dresden, through his life as he ruminates about life, death, time travel and the knowledge he received from the alien race of Tralfamadorians.  Billy has accepted the Tralfamadorian concept that all things exist at some point forever.  Even death is not what it seems, as the dead person is still alive at some time and that time is perpetually occurring.  Accordingly, there is no psychological stance to take on events other than acceptance.  Things will happen as they always have happened and there is nothing to be done about it.    Of course, everyone else thinks Billy is a lunatic.  The story unfolds in an extremely nonlinear manner, with Billy hopping from one time to another, sometimes in midparagraph.  Indeed, he has become \\"unstuck in time,\\" so that he lives the main episodes of his life in a random and illogical order.  Vonnegut deserves the credit he received for pulling this off without making it confusing to the reader.    Although light in tone, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE does address some deeper issues.  Fate, free will, cruelty and the absurdity of human nature are all here.  Comic relief is present throughout the book, with a dry fatalism providing an undercurrent to the events of Billy's life.  Vonnegut is not everyone's cup of tea, but there is no denying the talent it takes to pack major issues into such a strange literary structure and still make it readable for the audience.
B000QUCNP4|1.0|Not One Special Feature-NADA--Nuttin---In fact---it contains a preview  for the \\"director's cut \\" dvd that will be out in 2008--that one will have a plethora of special features including directors commentory.    I would give this DVD \\"zero\\" stars but one is the bare minimum on amazon.    I have not even seen the movie yet--i bought the dvd becuae i was intrigued by the zodiac case and expected to find great special features --especially from a great director like fincher---    i was so upset that this dvd contains NO Special features but has the gall to advertise the 2008 DVD release of this same movie--that i posted this review to vent and warn other potential buyers.     Why spend over $20 on a dvd with no special features when u can watch movie on pay perview for $5 and wait for the \\"real\\"  dvd of this film in 2008    I expected better from David Fincher--Take your Fans for granted and they will turn on you.  Absolutely No point buying this current worthless DVD--    My rant being over --i will now watch the movie and will comment on merits actual film later:  stay tunned
1594489505|5.0|A realistic tale of lives caught in the maelstrom of war in Afghanistan. The author's familiarity with the details of cruelty, helplessness, and resignation make this story feel very real. Its ending seems a bit optimistic given new developments in Afganistan, and the photographic lens is not as closely focused on life in Kabul as Hosseini's The Kite Runner, but it is a touching story. It made me ask again, why are we creating another war in Iraq?
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for this on dvd. It doesn't disappoint. The changes made by the director that differ from the book are a little odd, but not terrible. Still a great story even with the odd moments.
B000LE0TGA|5.0|ELO's ambitious \\"Out of the Blue\\" remains the standard by which all other ELO records would be judged. This is no doubt ELO's finest moment, a whopping double album of well crafted songs, each with a mini symphony of its own. It boggles the mind how so many good songs were written in such a short amount of time with such good production values. Many of the songs have a Broadway-like quality to them; For example, listen to \\"Wild West Hero\\", you will see what I mean.     There are also the radio staples: \\"Turn to Stone\\" and  \\"Sweet Talkin' Woman\\", no strangers to heavy rotation on the FM airwaves to this day. However, the underrated star of side one is \\"Across the Border\\", a sweet mixture of Beatles, Symphony Orchestra and Aculpulco. This is Jeff Lynne on top of the world, doing what he does best...Beatles inspired rock and roll with an experimental twist.     Side three gives us the \\"Concerto for a Rainy Day\\"..a mini record unto its own. \\"Big Wheels\\" and \\"Summer and Lightning\\" are timeless.    In short, if there were one ELO collection to get, this is the one.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|I thought with Freeman, Cusack, and the wilderness as ingredients,this movie had to be a winner. It was just so made-for-TV, B-movie kinda quality. Then there's the bizarre political message involving stem cell research. Three stars is actually probably generous of me.
B0000035E7|3.0|Nirvana's first record is underground, yo. I mean, who produced this album? Someone who was clearly not very experienced at producing records. You know how the keyboard player from the Kingsmen (they did \\"Louie, Louie\\") produced the Stooges' Fun House? I think he pulled a repeat performance here. The only song with anything that even resembles polish is the catchy, Beatleesque single \\"About a Girl\\" - it's also my favorite song on the album. Anyway, if you think Nirvana is just a bunch of noise, that's exactly how I'd describe this album: loud, crude cathartic punk with poor production and several solid songs: \\"Floyd the Barber\\" (almost poppy in a bizarre way), the forceful \\"Blew\\", darkly humorous \\"School\\", just plain dark \\"Scoff\\", hyperactive \\"Downer\\" and heavy rocker \\"Big Cheese\\". Now, the whole thing is primitive, sometimes obnoxiously so (\\"Mr. Moustache\\"; \\"Love Buzz\\"; \\"Negative Creep\\"; the awful guitar solo on \\"Swap Meet\\"), and the demented semi-power ballad \\"Sifting\\" just bugs the crap out of me. And other than \\"About a Girl\\", the lyrics are mostly awful. There's a lot of promise on this album, but the next two studio discs and Unplugged in New York are much better buys.
1881273156|5.0|I really liked this book, a good friend gave it to me for my wedding. I find the author's insights very true and helpful to keep a marriage alive and well for years to come, after the initial excitement has given way for the daily routine. I have given this book away for a recent wedding of my good friend. It is easy to read and understand and will make your relationship better if you follow the author's straight advice and adapt it to your specific situation. His gives many examples of real life stories that make this even more comprehendible. Very nice.
B000002UVZ|4.0|This is a very good album. Some people think it's the group's best, and indeed it's up there - for my part, I prefer the damn sellout (Yeah, Exhuming McCarthey's a commercial song, all right) Document. However, this is probably their second-best album. It pounds even the most acclaimed of the group's '90s work into the ground, too. I mean, Out of Time? A glorified single release for Losing My Religion? Get outta town! And Automatic for the People? A bunch of really good singles and absolutely wretched album tracks? It doesn't have a chance! And as for Around the Sun...<br /><br />Come on, do you need anyone here to tell you that this is better than Around the Sun?<br /><br />Anyway, let's get down to business here. The fog that was Fables of the Reconstruction had lifted, and in its place was an album that actually (gasp!) had some electric guitar, (no way!) lyrics with meaning, and (oh my god!) discernable vocals. For R.E.M. in 1986, this was as weird as weird could get - especially compared to Fables of the Reconstruction, which had little of the first and second and none of the third. The rockers are all pretty good, too: Begin the Begin, These Days, Hyena, Just a Touch, I Believe, and (my favorite on the record) their cover of Superman, sung by Mike Mills, all can be considered among the best of early R.E.M. (which basically means \\"The best of R.E.M.\\"). Now there are still folk songs: the Fairport Convention-like Swan Swan H, and the twin enivronmentalist songs Fall on Me (\\"Please don't... FAAAAALL ON MEEEEE! FAAAALL ON MEEEE!\\") and Cuyahoga, and those are great too! All of those songs could've made this the group's best album, but they have to ruin it with three tracks I haven't brought up yet, because they suck and I don't like songs that suck. There's an instrumental (Underneath the Bunker), and R.E.M.'s not a group known for being brilliant musicians. There's a faux-Latin thing (The Flowers of Guatemala) that turned out to be a total flop, and a poor, shoddy folk-rocker, What if We Gave It Away. It's still a great album in spite of those three, so pick it up if you like the group.hat if We Gave It Away. It's still a great album in spite of those three, so pick it up if you like the group.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Having been a teenager when the Stones music was new, I have the perspective of that exciting time in British rock music.  I love their early stuff, and this is an excellent compilation of great hits and less well-known great songs.  I recommend it without reservation to anyone of my vintage.  Cleary, this is not a technical, detailed review, just my brief, subjective impression.  Note, I am reviewing the DSD CD, not the Hybrid SACD.  I am not even sure Amazon has the latter - they sent me the wrong thing twice, so I gave up.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Highly recommended for R & B, dancehall... lovers. This is her definitive album. Jay Z is a Midas putting the final touches to the record and the track \\"Under My Umbrella\\" an all time gem.
B000JCETC4|5.0|I'm sure I'm not alone when I say give it up on the David / Roger feud.  Both are excellent in their field. Comparing this mini DVD to the \\"IN THE FLESH\\" full out concert is ridiculous. A more comparision would be with PULSE and DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER. Both mind blowing concerts.  At least David is putting out some film lately.  Anyway, the point of this post is to ask that everyone go to David \\"and\\" Roger's websites and ask for more video footage.  Plead with David to release DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER.   Let's face it, age is a factor and we need more live footage for keepsake.  Release anything. We'll buy it.   We need more to archive for when the day comes that the infamous Pink Floyd is no more. So please contact David, Pink Floyd, Roger and ask for more of their legacy to be put on film so that we have much to enjoy and pass on to future generations. Check their websites or any way you can contact them.  Thanks  Anon4
B000J103PC|2.0|Warning: This review contains my own skewed sense of humor full of slang and more.<br /><br />The story of frumpy, ugly girl from Ohio goes to the big city (aka Manhattan) in search of \\"the\\" dream job has been done TOO many times!<br /><br />And we've seen it all before.  Frumpy, ugly girl goes through complete transition and becomes classy, pretty girl after landing the job \\"a million other girls want.\\"<br /><br />Of course, frumpy girl has frumpy boyfriend who does not transition with her and, in the end, makes for a strained relationship.<br /><br />If you've watched just one of these movies, I don't have to tell you the outcome...you know it already.<br /><br />Frankly, you have your coming of age movies for your teens (and many of their movies are better than this one) and this you have this movie:  a single-just-out-of-college movie.<br /><br />It's been done...and done to death.  Come on, try a little originality!<br /><br />P.S.  Am I the only one who thought Meryl Streep looked too much like Cruella from 101 Dalmations? Add a black streak to that gray and there ya have it! :)
B00005U8EM|5.0|I'd seen only bits and pieces of \\"Groundhog Day\\", and hadn't cared for it. Then I sat down yesterday and watched the whole thing.<br /><br />I was flabbergasted. This is a movie about the way we piss away our lives, day by day, never improving our own lives or the lives of those around us.<br /><br />Unhesitatingly recommended.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I found the soundtrack for the movie Once on the Amazon website and ordered it.  This was my first experience ordering from Amazon.  The CD is wonderful and it arrived within a couple of days.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I can't say I'm a huge Leonardo DeCapprio fan but he really does a fine job in this portrayal of the young Howard Hughes. He gets a lot of support from a great cast and the screenplay is very witty and engaging. A really good movie. It took me a while to get to this one but I'm glad I finally did.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|For fans of Loreena McKennitt, this is the concert video that we have all been waiting for... it is just stunning!<br /><br />There is a possible point of confusion here, as there are TWO versions of the same performance offered on Amazon. The ONLY difference is the packaging, both contain 3 disks (2 cd's and one DVD). This set is packaged as a jewel box set, and the other is packaged in a DVD sized container. At first, I ordered both, thinking that one set was a DVD video and the other was a CD audio version. After I realized my mistake, I canceled this jewel box order and got the DVD sized package (which was cheaper at the time).<br /><br />Whichever version you buy, I am sure you will be captivated by this magnificent performance, recorded in a magnificent setting!
B000P2A24W|5.0|Lost Highway is a pleasant surprise.  I wasn't sure what to expect after hearing that it had a twist of country sound, but I LOVE it!  I bought it at the beginning of the summer and listened to it on my MP3 while traveling all over Europe.  It felt good to have a piece of home with me any time I wanted it. Right from the title song, Lost Highway, the rhythm and lyrics grab you.  Jon Bon Jovi's voice still has his characteristic strong edge, but crafted in a haunting way to make the songs stick in your mind. Make a Memory, Seat Next to You, Everybody's Broken, and Stranger with Leanne Rimes are unforgettable!  We Got It Going On and I Love This Town bring back the sounds of Bon Jovi from the 80's.    I enjoy this CD!  It's well rounded, matured yet full of excitement!
B0000CABBW|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I couldn't help but become emotionally invested into the characters, especially Pai(Keisha Castle-Hughes). Her portrayal of the character, and also the relationship between her and the grandfather, was absolutely amazing. I loved seeing such a strong young girl as the lead character. It's a good example of how one person (even a child) can change things for the better.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|They did a great job on this special edition from the box to the commentary with the cast members.  The commentary tells us that there was much more to the movie that Joss had to edit out to keep the movie under two hours, which is a real shame!  The commentary is a lot of fun, and it is clear that the actors really enjoyed playing these roles.  The section on Serenity Fans is fine but it doesn't compared to [[ASIN:B000IJFJDG Done The Impossible: The Fans' Tale of Firefly & Serenity]].  If you like Han Solo (But wanted better dialog) in Star Wars, Serenity/Firefly is for you.    Definitely buy this, and buy the series on DVD [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] (If you don't already own it), you will not regret it.

B000G1ALRK|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing Two Pink Lines on the radio.  I liked his first single, How Bout You, but grew a little tired of it from the radio.      I don't think there is one song I don't like on this album.  I usually hate it when people on here say that every song is great and love them all, but that's the case for me here.  Two Pink Lines, Guys Like Me, How Bout You, Livin' Pat of Life, Pledge . . .Hag, Before She Does are all fun, loud speaker songs.  Sinners like me, The Hard Way, Can't Take It With You, These Boots, What i Almost Was, they are great lyrical, softer songs.  I'm a big, burly, beer drinkin' guy, but my jaw dropped when I heard Lightning.  That song sends chills down my spine.      The best part is that he wrote/co wrote every song on the album.  He's not like Kenny Chesney or some of those guys who are a puppet with a plastic cowboy hat on, holding a guitar.  Church is a musician.  Maybe needs a haircut, but that's my only gripe . . .    You should have already bought this album.  If not, go buy it now and never take it out of your CD player.
0345409671|5.0|\\"Memnoch the Devil\\" is my favorite Chronicle to this day. I just finished all of the Vampire Chronicles, and Memnoch holds true to its placement. I don't believe in God or the Devil, but this is an exciting journey which Lestat guides us through. This book didn't make me believe in God or even question the existence. It was just a fun book. And I think it has the best ending I have ever read or seen in any movie.<br />Rice maintains her wonderful descriptions of life through a vampire's everlasting eyes and deep philosophical sentences that keep you awake at night, pondering how she can think of such bravura sentences. In her words \\"Maybe that's what hell is. You go mad, and all your demon's come and get you just as fast as you can think them up.\\"
B000PFUA9G|4.0|My favorite CD of his has been Mud on the Tires and I was a little disappointed by his last one.  It was alright, but not as good as the other one.      But this CD is better than his last one and almost as good as Mud on the Tires.  Some of the songs are very funny, something which isn't new for him.  But he has his serious love songs, and religious songs.  I kinda agree with some of the other reviews, there is a lot of non-music on it, but that's kinda his thing.  I don't like it when I have my windows down in my truck and the Kung Pao Buckaroos come on.  They're funny, but I don't listen to them more than once.  I also don't like the police siren on Mr. Policeman, it scares me when I'm driving and it comes on.    I was tired of Ticks from the radio by the time I got the album.  But it is a great song, along with Online, I'm Still a Guy, Letter to Me, actually they're all pretty dang good!    I saw Brad in concert a few years ago and he is a class act.  The concert area got 8 inches of rain the night before and they couldn't get all the equipment on stage.  So we just got Brad, a stool, and his guitar and it was great.  This was a little after I'm Gonna Miss Her came out.  Two young boys had a sign that said 'Take us fishin'\\"  He brought them up on stage and gave them free hats and t-shirts.      Buy the album!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|A western that will never be dated, this is one of the best American movies ever made -- existential, funny, with writing and a score that make it perpetually modern. Where are our new Paul Newmans and Robert Redfords? Young lions of Hollywood, please take a cue from these guys as both actors and men. Please.
0440238609|4.0|A great book to just sit and read.  I have only finished the first book and am anticipating the movie.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I was skeptical about a Pumpkins album done without James and Darcy, but this  rocks. It's in heavy rotation on my CD player (both in the house and in the car, and that's saying something - my other CDs sit in one place). As for the band, I caught one of their Fillmore shows in SF - they were tight and strong on both old and new material, and even played some songs better than the original group, especially tracks from Machina (Heavy Metal Machine was amazing in concert). Billy Corgan still has it as a singer/guitarist/songwriter, and Jimmy Chamberlin is one of rock's best drummers. Buy this album, you'll enjoy it.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|This release had me hooked from the start and gave me the impression that there was a very creative vibe surrounding it.  After watching the companion DVD's \\"making of\\" documentary, it was reaffirmed that this project seemed to pour out of the band during the writing/recording process.  Watching the tidbits of creative epiphanies in the studio makes me appreciate this CD even more.  This album is a very cohesive project that I think reflects a rare occurrence in the music industry where a band can have such longevity and still find it in themselves to be excited by their own music and find inspiration in each other's contributions to the music.  I have not had a CD grow on me like this in some time where I find myself playing it in my head when not listening to it.  It's hard not to be caught up in the band's enthusiasm for this release.  Seeing the band perform live recently capped the experience.
B0000242BH|5.0|This CD transcends ordinary beauty. I can almost imagine basing a religion around it.     The only thing I can say is that it is what it is supposed to be; a musical instrument played alone, by a master, and sounding for all the world like a human voice, breathing, speaking, crying, searching. Unbelievable until you hear it.
B00004STPT|5.0|Does anyone feel that some of the vamps from the fight scenes sound awfully similar to those in Pirates of the Caribbean?
B00005NTJK|5.0|The first handful of Jethro Tull albums were remastered back in 2002. I have read a lot of complaints about the job done on them, except for this one. I would like to point out that the reason the first two albums sound pretty muddled, is because that was how they sounded in the first place. Album three: BENEFIT, was a beautifully recorded album in the first place, with layers of sound on every track. Making this remaster, probably the best of the lot.<br /><br />Benefit is probably my favorite TULL disc anyway. Seems to me like this was the one where the band really clicked entirely during the production. The sound is great, atmospherical and hard rockin when it needs to be. It sounds like a band in the groove. Sure Aqualung gets way more acclaim, but I'm not sure if it is overall as good of an album as this one. Just had more hits... but listen to any of these tracks, my favorites being WITH YOU THERE TO HELP ME, and NOTHING TO SAY leading it off... but every track is classic Tull at it's best. Cynical rocking with lots of great trippy effects and probably some of Andersons best songwriting. If you are a fan of Jethro Tull you gotta check this one out...
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Passion is no substitute for reason . An Inconvenient Truth is riddled with one sided , misleading , exaggerated and speculative statements statements as well as those which are just plain wrong . Combined with IPCC spurious statistics and conjectural worst cases it leads to economic agendas which will halt growth and all it has done to alleviate global poverty and misery in its tracks . Underpinning the phony and alarmist pseudo science is Al Gore's often expressed visceral hatred of modern society . We should not let his personal agenda ride rough shod over the livelihood of billions .
B000NA77YO|5.0|Ok, personally, I think this is cool. Dio was a great frontman for Sabbath, and I don't see why there shouldn't be a greatest hits compilation of his years with the band. Cooler is the fact that the 1992 line-up of Dio Sabbath (thats Vinny Appice on drums not Bill Ward) are back on reunion, and have included three new tracks to the mix. I like all three (slow one, medium one, and a fast one... quoted)...<br /><br />I was once an Ozzy-Sabbath purist, but that was years ago. Dio Sabbath is a whole different sound for the most part (some of the songs sound very Ozzy-era from Mob Rules, band wise, I think... any time you hear a version of say War Pigs though, with Dio on vocals, run away...) ....but, it's a different style of music. Dio has a completely different charisma than old school Ozzy did, so if you are strictly an Ozzy years type of person, you may not like this stuff.<br /><br />Dio has altered his style a little over the years (that little Troll has been performing since the mid sixties, he must be 120 years old by now, but thats only like 30 maybe in Hobbit years) and you can see the difference between the sound from the '81 incarnation, to the '92 one and to the one presented here. But they all rock out in their own ways ('92 stuff is really solid- the Dehuminizer album was a blast! Maybe my favorite of them all) Dio is a little corny at times, but I think he always fit right in with Sabbath.<br /><br />One Issue. There were only three Dio fronted Sab albums, and then the live one from '82, which was garbage in my ears. And of course, one of those tracks had to be awkwardly placed into this collection. Easily another great track could have been taken from any one of the other three albums (like, even the studio version of Children Of The Sea... however Time Machine would have been the best bet, it was in Waynes World for christ sake) Still an excellent sampler of the less popular Dio fronted Sabbath. Ozz purists, maybe give it a spin, before you judge... Sabbath really turned up the volume when Ozzy left.he volume when Ozzy left.
0800141660|5.0|We love this movie.  The acting in it is great and you'll come to love each character like an old friend.  It is a movie we watch over an over again, enjoying it everytime.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It's great the first time you see it and every time after that. You can also just put it on while you're doing work, chores, etc and let it play in the background.
B000096I9G|5.0|I'm with Mr Brady on this (hi Jeff).  This DVD is by far & away the best live recording officially available from the Cure.  Flawless! Fact!    Let's all hope that the Cure see sense & dain to issue the last Wembley concert from 1989 on DVD, as I see that is the only thing that would better this.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|I have to say I was quite disappointed with this film.   It was very, very different to the book.    It was quite shallow and didn't go into any of the prophecies with any degree of depth.   If you hadn't read the book you couldn't possibly understand the message.   Overall, very disappointing.     Some lovely scenery at times though.
B00005MP58|5.0|I was pleased with the timely manner I recieved the movie and the price I recieved.  I got this on the bonus buy.  I enjoyed the movie and it is of good quality.  No complaints. Thanks.
B000O75VSU|5.0|After listing to the album a couple of times I realized that it is one of, if not the greatest, album After Forever has released. The album has a lot of energy. The music is powerful and the vocals are amazing. Floor continually shows that she is the greatest female singer in her genre. With every new release, she seems to improve.  I always find myself saying, \\" This is her pinnacle,\\" but she continues to improve. If you are new to the band, this is a great album to start with. You will find that they will quickly become one of your favorite bands.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review.
B00005JPFE|3.0|I saw this movie with my daughter last week based on recommendations from several people. The start was really nasty with a maniacal lady going crazy and shooting at some rats and anything else that moved with a shotgun. The vindictive maniac then chased the rats outside her house still shooting. Of course no nice police came along to take her to a nice padded cell. Things got better and a plot actually unfolded. There was one more scene of gratuitous violence where two lovers do some more shooting before making up. After that the movie picks up a half decent plot which was entertaining enough to keep us in the theater. The lessons were alright with the usual things about misfits finding a place if they work hard enough. Nevertheless, I would have given this movie a 4.5 rounded up to a 5, was it not for the shooting scenes. As is, it is more like a 3.5 rounded down to 3. It seems that Hollywood in its current depraved state is unable to make any movie even one for little kids that is free of unnecessary gun violence. It is a real shame and a terrible reflection on our society. No wonder we have so much violence in our schools.
1582701709|1.0|The secret is that they sold this book and got rich off of the people looking for the secret.
0684857219|5.0|I've read through several books from Amazon and downloadable off the internet and this is one is by far the best one for the money.  The only one that comes close to this one is the Men's Heath Home Workout Workbook (no longer in print).  You can buy 17 different muscle books and get 17 different and conflicting instructions sets (and that holds true if you bought 17 different Men's Health books).    This book doesn't have all the information on every aspect of bodybuilding but it has a good base on pretty much every aspect.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The Don Killuminati is without a doubt a must have for any die-hard hip-hop fan. An instant classic and thriller with an extremely dark overtone that grabs hold of you from the beginning and never lets go until the very end. What makes it so great is you get the feeling that 2Pac could've recorded this high on weed and adrenaline while being incarcerated in a windowless foreign prison cell. It's raw, grimy, and devoid of the over-polished production that plagued many of the tracks on \\"All Eyez On Me\\". This is 2Pac at his best, in all of his walking contradiction, yet supreme authoritative style that every fan has grown to appreciate over the years. I first bought this the week it was released while I was still in high school. Recently decided to re-purchase after losing the old one and not having listened to it for a while. What can you say --- over ten years later and it's still holds up nicely when compared to today's not as great/weak hip-hop scene. This album is still banging. Still relevant. And still, 2Pac is deeply missed.
B000FA57RG|5.0|The documentary updates \\"Truth or Dare.\\"  Like it's predecessor, behind-the scenes footage appears in black-and-white, while concert segments vibrantly come alive in color.  DVD comes with a CD containing live performances of most of the songs on the tour.
B00009XITQ|5.0|this is definately a must see if u like comedies and of course the pretty Amanda Bynes! she's just so cool and talented. this movie is greattt
B000GY729M|4.0|I say mad props to The Killers for their tribute to America. Sam's Town is a much better whole than Hot Fuss which sounded like a mash of singles. It has the \\"concept album listen through all the way without skipping tracks\\" feel. Some of the tracks are completely forgettable though. My List, Uncle Jonny, and This River Is Wild will slip your mind as fast as they play through your speakers. However just as there are cons on this record there are pros. Read My Mind, Bling (Confession Of A King), Bones, and When You Were Young are all smashing icons of the year that was 2006. The Killers are wonderful lyricists and writers and their next effort may be flawless. I definitely recommend this for purchase but DO Not expect another Mr. Brightside :) This is the mature real deal from the quartet. I have one problem though with Brandon and his \\"god complex\\". He stated in Blender magazine that he would put Sam's Town up against Achtung Baby and Ok Computer. Mr. Flowers, I don't believe you have the privelege of making that statement. Only time can say. Whether you agree or disagree thanks for reading.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|...this is a powerful masterpiece, but a little underrated, from a incredible band. In my opinion, the second DT best album.  Stay Heavy!
0316067598|5.0|Since getting my first copy of LONE SURVIVOR I have bought six more. I am sending it to selected young people who I believe will be as enamored by Marcus Luttrell, and his comrades, as I am. First, Marcus Luttrell is a MAN, a real MAN. His actions epitomize the definition of what a MAN should be. He was taught how to be a MAN by his parents, others who influenced his early life, and the MEN he trained with and suffered with. Above all things, his understanding of what comrades are, taught to him by Navy SEAL indoctrination, carried him through one of the most grueling tests of courage any human being has had to face.You MUST read this book!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|My wife and I saw Grindhouse opening day.  Three days later I took more friends to see it.  It is THAT good.  For me, Grindhouse was opening trailers followed by Planet Terror followed by trailers and concluding with Death Proof.  Thats the movie - this DVD release is half of Grindhouse.  As much as I love Death Proof (and am certainly interested in see the uncut version) the films really really work well together in the double feature format.  I don't see why we couldn't have a set with the theatrical double and then both uncut films.  Ah well, one can hope.  In the meantime I'm sure I'll purchase Death Proof and Planet Terror as seperate releases - its better than nothing after all.    As to the movie itself, Death Proof is fantastic.  Its a fascinating combination of Tarantino dialogue and unbelievable car chases.  Plus, it has Kurt Russell in his best role since Escape from NY.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|GRINDHOUSE was a movie experience and should be released as one movie on DVD.  Obviously since it tanked at the box office the studio is trying to make money by releasing the two portions of Grindhouse as seperate films.<br /><br />That's too bad because DEATH-PROOF is by far the weaker half of Grindhouse.<br /><br />This is the first movie where I felt the Tarantino formula didn't work.  Normally his dialogue is catchy, repeatable, and fun to listen to.  In this movie the women have nothing fun or memorable to discuss.  Furthermore they don't even talk like women when they debate about the finer points of a vintage car...sorry I didn't accept this for one second as anything plausible.<br /><br />Deathproof does end on a strong note with a stellar car chase sequence, but unfortunately there's nothing before this scene to give the movie any additional gravity or to make the movie hold together.  I'm sure the Tarantino die-hard fans will buy this DVD and then buy the entire Grindhouse when it is inevitably RE-released.  Thus the entire marketing ploy by the studios.<br /><br />Don't be a sheep.  Rent this do NOT buy it and request that the studio just release GRINDHOUSE as it was meant to be, a B-quality DOUBLE FEATURE.
0618871713|5.0|This memoir could have been called \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" but that title is taken.  Nevertheless, that is the most apt description for Fun Home that I can think of.  Alison Bechdel's spare prose and simple, black-and-white line drawings convey an emotional complexity that will push buttons for many, if not all, readers because in one way or another most of us suffered childhoods that tested our abilities to make sense of the senseless.<br /><br />My own childhood was nothing like Bechdel's, yet at the same time it was exactly like hers.  All of the details are different, while all of the feelings are the same.  I would say that at the heart of Fun Home lies Bechdel's need to justify to herself the love she felt (and continues to feel) for a father who was too wrapped up in his own identity conflicts to even acknowledge, much less help address, his child's.  And who was too weak even to live out his full two score and seven, taking his life sometime in his 40s when Bechdel was just out of college.<br /><br />Bechdel's contempt for her father is apparent, as is her love.  She is at once angry and admiring, cynical about his motives and proud of his accomplishments.  Her ambivalence is nearly overwhelming, and something that I suspect many of us share in relation to our parents.  In the end, I believe, the lucky ones among us come to some inner accommodation wherein we are able to forgive our parents for their lapses, even those that are quite literally sinful, and honor the things they were able to do that live on in our hearts and minds after they are gone.<br /><br />Fun Home is a beautiful book whose drawings aid the reader's imagination in fleshing out details of an early life that was deeply felt and well lived.  I highly recommend it.
B000001XN2|4.0|I agree with the reviewers who have praised all the principals. I would put Price's exquisite Leonora at the top of a very strong list of leads -- her highs are incredibly liquid and golden-toned, and her vocal quality throughout her range is beautiful to listen to. Corelli's power and emotion are fabulous (he's probably my favorite tenor), and I consider him the definitive Manrico. However, I wish that he would have sung the parts along with the chorus right before the end of \\"Di Quella Pira\\" (as he does in his studio recordings). Simionato is a compelling Azucena and I disagree with reviews that called her voice \\"ugly\\" - I would say dramatic and in character. Bastianini is strong and villanous, though his voice sometimes gets lost in the mix in ensembles -- it sounds like he moved downstage.    The pace is breathtaking, though at the cost of precision (singers and orchestra out of sync occasionally, not surprisingly for a live performance). It's the imperfect orchestral/vocal balance, mono, and occasional raggedness of ensemble that makes it less than a 5 for me. Though I weight the singing a 5, the sound is only a 2 compared to modern recordings, thus my overall rating of 4.
0671027344|4.0|I wish I'd discovered \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" when I was still in high school. The main character is stunningly real and gives an authentic literary voice for millions of young adults. He goes through typical youthful indiscretions without the gloss of so many other stories featuring teens. Its short enough to finish in one read and powerful for readers of all ages.
B000002KAT|5.0|PERFECTION!.... I used to sit back in a rocking chair and meditate to this album. It is still the best, but I love almost all of his music. Moondance hooked me but this album made me collect every van cd I could find. I love his music, even albums I did not like at first I listen to again and hear new things. Seeing him in The Last Waltz is the ultimate! Van is the Man, the Belfast Cowboy, his voice is an instrument unto itself. Moondance is stll my all time favorite song but this album is the best.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I first heard her on Myspace and loved her music.  I had to get the CD.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002G6J|5.0|It's kind of easy listening. The sort of music you hear in shopping malls, restaurants and such. But if you stop savoring your lobster with cocktail sauce and take the time to listen to this music, maybe you'll hear an unexpected instrumental break. It could also happen that you hear a particular tune you heard over and over for the last twenty years but all of a sudden that tune becomes surprising because the piano starts improvising in a jazzy way.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Dialogo\\" and \\"Lamento\\" remind you of the fact that the Portuguese, even in South-America, are prone to 'Saudade': a feeling of longing and melancholy.<br />It's a pity that the CD has only 30 minutes of music.
0792839749|5.0|A wonderful movie with a delightful cast, great movie for kids to watch, and written by Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond.
0385751060|1.0|I must confess the book was recommended to me by a colleague who either did not know (or if she did, did not care) that I am Jewish.  The content of the book has shocked me, disgusted me and I have had nightmares for two weeks, during which time I have been taking anti-anxiety pills.    All of this reflects on two things: the quality of the writing is evidently excellent;  the subject matter is, to my mind, totally tasteless.    Mr. Boyne has a lot of talent, and I fervently wish for him to continue writing, but I'd love for him to close the WWII chapter.
B000TQ9RHW|5.0|Somewhere In Time stirred deep emotions in both my wife and myself.  It is a powerfully nostalgic story of a man who fell in love with a woman from the past.  The movie theme tune \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is taken from Rachmaninoff's Rapsody On A Theme Of Paganini.
075640407X|5.0|I don't have much to add to what's already been said except to say that it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  I can't say it's completely \\"perfect\\" in my own personal opinion, mostly with the occasional minor pacing issues,  but seriously I loved the heck out of it.  As the first effort from a new author, it's staggering.  I'm left yearning for the remaining parts of the trilogy.    If you've any doubts as to whether you should go ahead and purchase this book, put them out of your mind and order it.  You will not be sorry.
B00005JPLW|5.0|300 is a movie unlike any other I have ever seen. It has a modern resonance that is beyond what entertainment is. I believe there are only 3 movies that are perfectly made in the history of films which are, Gone with the Wind, Lord of the Rings and 300.<br /><br />In overall perspective and theme of the movie, this film just totally rocks and is a hardcore excellent film.<br /><br />1. The script is spectacularly amazing, effective and full of impact. It not only is true to the original comic but it captures effectively the characters, the mood, the theme.<br /><br />2. The visuals are fantastic... the film is enhanced with the digital, artsy-comic style embedded in the movie. I am not a big fan of fully CGI movies, but this one SHOULDN'T be made NOT digital. The look of the movie is stunning in itself, surrealistic (as it should be) and very modern.<br /><br />3. The direction by Zack Snyder was amazing and I was in all honesty blown away by his style. Very unique, very effective, just astoundingly above the standards of hollywood directors. He perfects commercialism combined with artful discretion. It is perfection. A single scene even without dialogue speaks more about the background of Spartans, whatever that scene needed to tell than a movie full of words.<br /><br />4. Cheorography is not to be underestimated. Unlike most action war battle scenes in most commercial movies, the fight scenes in 300 are not chaotic, effortlessly (or so it would seem to the audience) beautiful and effectively captures the strength, the weakness, the inevitable force of the film.<br /><br />5. THERE ARE FEW WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THIS MOVIE HAS RAISED THE BAR IN HOLLYWOOD FILMS, and those words I cannot find the most fitting for 300, because this movie is just sooo overwhelming beautiful and perfected in a way that a small budget film (that it is) can ever achieve. We will be hard pressed to find a movie to match this one.<br /><br />WATCH IT, BUY IT and you will NOT have regrets!<br /><br />The second disc contains many featurettes, deleted scenes and behind the scenes although honestly i couldnt get enough of them.scenes and behind the scenes although honestly i couldnt get enough of them.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|What more can I say about this film that nobody else has said. This film is an ultimate masterpiece! This was the 2nd one of Kurosawa's work that I saw, RAN being the first and both are just spectacular. This is an epic film that has a little bit of everything to offer. The thing that makes Kurosawa so gret is that he's a master storyteller. This film is over 3 hours in length but it moves at a brisk pace. The first half builds the charachters and sets the situation while the 2nd half is pure action. This movie is so detailed and there's alot of small notes that end up paying off in a huge way. Some of my favorite scenes are by Toshiro Mifune as I instanly had to see anything he was in especially work by Kurosawa. I love films and this is my favorite of alltime. Forget about the black and white, forget that it's over 40 years old, forget about the 3 plus hours. Even if you're not into foreign films I highly reccomend viewing this masterpiece at least once. This is how films were meant to be because it takes you through all the emotions without being over the top. Take into perspective that there's no special effects and that's a huge plus. There's actually a scene where a man gets trampled by a horse, there's the beautifuly shot duel between the master swordsman, and there's the raw emotion by Mifune! All in all, this is a good as movie can get. There are wonderful extras on this disc as it comes in a 3 disc package. Tons of extra insight behind the man, the legend. Thanks for your time!
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's words are truly incredible.  This is the first in a long long of phenomenal works by him.  The Power of Now definitely sets a foundation--not only for the works to come--but for peace in your life and in your mind. In the years of seeking for truth from others, Eckhart is one of the few that has kept me coming back, that seems to keep his integrity throughout time and who really guides us to effortless positive change in our lives.

0385338902|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as much as I had expected to.  I love reading stories about dysfunctional families, but somehow these characters did not seem believable to me.  His work has been compared to Tom Perrotta and Nick Hornsby, authors whom I love.  I don't feel that he comes close to matching their complexity, richness, or depth. To be fair, perhaps a twenty-five year old male might appreciate the book more than I did.

0143039601|5.0|As Kerouac notes in the introductory chapter, he met Gary Snyder, a.k.a. Japhy Ryder in 1955, just before Snyder went off to Japan to immerse himself in Zen Buddhism.  What follows is a free-wheeling account of their time together in perhaps Kerouac's most appealling and certainly most postive book.  Dharma Bums is a celebration of American Buddhism, which was budding in San Francisco at the time, with a number of Beat poets reading their haikus and free-verse poems at the Six Gallery in San Francisco.  Once again, Kerouac revels in changing names, but among the many prominent faces presented in this autobiographical novel are Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Rexroth and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.  Snyder was the rising star, a Buddhist scholar and translator of books of Japanese and Chinese poetry while studying at Berkley.  Snyder, like Kerouac, had working class roots and the two hit it off from the start, exulting in each other's state of being.<br /><br />Kerouac devotes Dharma Bums to Snyder in the same way he did On the Road to Neal Cassady.  It was one of Kerouac's more happy times, as he was heavy into Buddhism, and sought out Snyder as a soulmate and mentor.  Kerouac sets the stage wonderfully, coming across a hobo reading from St. Theresa on a train bound for LA, coming back from Mexico.  He then hops the \\"Zipper\\" up to San Francisco, which whirled along at 80 miles an hour on the California coastline.  Kerouac hangs out at Ginsberg's cabin in the Berkley hills, but it is Snyder's spartan cabin that draws his attention.  Snyder had already chosen to live the life of an aesthete, giving up most of his worldly possessions, except for his famous rucksack and orange crates of books, mostly of poetry.  Kerouac captures some wonderful moments as they all gathered around drinking wine and engaging in yab yum with a girl who went by the name of Princess.<br /><br />The heart of the story revolves around Jack's and Gary's hike to the Matterhorn in the Sierra Nevada, in which the two form a strong bond that propells Kerouac on other adventures, including a summer at Desolation Peak in the northern Cascades that would become the subject of his next book, Desolation Angels.  Kerouac's writing shines in this book, as he is able to maintain such an ecstatic high throughout the narrative, almost seeming to touch the sky.  Of course, having such a positive person like Gary Snyder to wrap the book around gave Kerouac the impelling force he needed, as on his own Kerouac often sank into melancholy and despair, which characterized his later years.  One marvels at the free and easy nature of this pair as they search out their respective enlightenment, drawing on nature and their sense of the eternal cosmos.<br /><br />One doesn't have to be well versed in Buddhism to appreciate this book, although allusions and references are many and may confuse some readers.  Just let yourself go and enjoy the free flow of the narrative, which is Kerouac at his best.rong bond that propells Kerouac on other adventures, including a summer at Desolation Peak in the northern Cascades that would become the subject of his next book, Desolation Angels.

0061139378|4.0|If Coraline is a children's book, it's only because of the length at 26 years old I was completely drawn into the story and and coudn't put it down. the summer holiday's are getting boring for Coraline. she and her parents have recently moved to the country, to one of the flats in an old renovated house. observing the neighbors and exploring everything in sight has been interesting, but it's getting old, and Coraline's parents; who both work at home aren't doing much to entertain her. In fact she's quite annoyed with them. Coraline craves adventure, and by stepping through a mysterious door in her apartment, she's about to discover that some adventures a better left alone.<br /><br />Despite the scare factor or maybe due to it, this book has some powerful positive messages, and the scary bits are so well crafted that their full impact didn't hit me right a way. Who new black button eyes could be so cringe worthy. My over all impression of Caraline is that it play's out like a very Tim Burtonesque silent movie, I highly recomend the Coraline experience.<br /><br />Caroline goes to the movies. Oct. '08
037582913X|5.0|This was one of my sisters and my favorite books as a child.  I looked at local bookstores for awhile before finding it for my own kids.  It was also a favorite of my husband's as a child.  I have to say almost every adult I've talked to about it, loved it as a child also!  It became an instant favorite for my kids.  We read it over & over again just like I did with my parents.  You won't be disappointed!
B000093OU8|5.0|A great album from start to finish, and IMO Gary's last great hard rock album (After The War is good, but one could sense that his heart wasn't into this genre anymore). Gary was huge in '87, with (at least) 3 big singles in the title track, Over The Hills, and Friday On My Mind. Be sure to check out the Live At Isstadion video as well (not sure if it's out on dvd yet), which includes an amazing (and long!) version of The Loner.
6301966562|5.0|Where is the DVD?  Have you seen some of the other crap that has come out on DVD from the 80's?  This one is a no brainer, it should have been released on disc years ago.  Hurry up !!
B000EZIJKO|5.0|One of my favorite books as a child. I would lock myself in my room and read it in one afternoon.  Truly a classic. The new movie with Johnny Depp doesn't do the book justice like the Original movie with Gene Wilder and Jack Albert.  They just don't write books like this anymore.
B00005NIL9|3.0|While I'm not the biggest fan of Free's mid-tempo style (in the early days almost every one of their songs had the same plodding tempo- ugh!) I do believe Fire and Water is a quality hard rock release.  I never liked \\"All Right Now\\" at ALL, but the title song makes up for that little slip up without a doubt.  The first side of this album is much better than the second in terms of songwriting.  A blues/hard rock album is what's in store for you.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I was thoroughly charmed by Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor in this movie.  Zellweger's role as the beleaguered Beatrix who must deal with an overbearing and critical mother and a weak father was beautifully acted and quite engaging.  McGregor was appealing as the suitor in love, and the authenticity of the sets and costumes enabled the viewer to feel a part of the era.  The movie hinted that Beatrix might have a touch of insanity, with animated paintings and her occasional appearance of confusion, but this is never brought out definitively.  I knew nothing of Beatrix Potter's life before watching the movie, but I came away with respect for her tenacity and courage, as well as compassion for the pain she suffered.  This is a movie well worth watching, and both Zellweger and McGregor bring a vitality and depth to it that make it compelling.  The real Beatrix Potter's delightful paintings are featured prominently to great effect, and all told the movie provides  a great viewing experience.

072325804X|5.0|I purchased this single book collection of Beatrix Potter stories because our oldest, aged four, loves Peter Rabbit. We had planned to read one story per evening before bed but the great writing style and pictures of Ms. Potter so grabbed our four year old's attention that we ended up reading one at bed, at rising in the morning and before nap time. Even my husband would drop what he was busy with to come and listen to storytime! The adventures and the names Ms Potter came up with are charming and fun to say. One does have to know some Engligh terms and be able to explain those vocabulary on the quick but it sure is fun to hear your child increase his vocabulary with the neighbor kids! We have certainly gotten a hoot out of the appropriate word usage he has picked up from these stories and then will explain to his friends to help \\"teach\\" them. We've read through this book many times to our delight.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|300 is a spectacular motion picture, especially on Blu-ray.  The picture is incredible and to be expected being in HD.  What I was truly surprised by was the magnificent sound using the uncompressed PCM 5.1 sound track.  It will rock your house.  Fantastic movie all around.  I would recommend it to anyone.

0385504209|4.0|I really liked this book when I read it. Then I bought another book of his...Angels and Demons...and it was even better than this one.
B00005JMAH|4.0|My favorite BOOK of the series and my LEAST favorite movie of the series so far.  I know movies can't always follow the books they're based on EXACTLY-- however, this movie left out some pretty important stuff.  Not only that, but things were added to the movie that were not in the book.  So here's the good, the bad and the ugly about \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\"...   First-- the good:  It's not a bad movie.  The acting's good overall.  There's a lot of action and a good storyline with a couple of twists and turns toward the end.  The scenery is beautiful and you see a lot more of the grounds surrounding Hogwarts than in previous movies...and there's a beautiful scene of Harry's ride on the hippogriff.  If you've not read the books but you've seen movies 1 and 2 (or at least know the Harry Potter basics), I think you'll enjoy yourself even if you don't know what the heck is going on all the time.  (It IS the third of a series so you DO need to know something of the first two to really know what's going on.)   Now-- the bad:  If you really liked the first 2 movies, there are some major changes in this one that are hard to get used to.  First, many of the sets are completely different.  Now Hagrid's hut is far away from the castle across a long bridge and down a steep hill... and the Whomping Willow (that nearly destroyed the Weasleys' car in movie 2) is out in the forest-- not near the school.  (These sets are also used in movies 4 and 5.)  Also, many of the faces of other students you're used to seeing in the background (like Susan Bones, Lee Jordan, Oliver Wood) have been replaced by new unfamiliar actors-- some with speaking parts but you can't identify them with characters in the book.  (Neville, Dean, and Sean are there, but there's a strange unidentified boy running around with Draco.)  Then there's Dumbledore...  When Mr. Harris died, they understandably had to find a relacement.  But Mr. Gambon plays a much different Dumbledore than Mr. Harris did.  He's not bad--just different.  He looks different, dresses differently, moves around quicker and just doesn't have that powerful calm presence that is associated with the character and which Mr. Harris achieved so well.  Also, it's a little weird that Professor Flitwick, who was portrayed in the last movies as an old grey haired wizard, is now much younger with short black hair and a moustache!  Some people enjoyed the \\"new look\\" of the movie... others (including myself) didn't.   Okay-- now for the ugly:  For those who've read and enjoyed Book 3, I think you'll be anywhere from 'somewhat' to 'severely' disappointed.  There are (of course) a lot of nitpicky things I could mention (like Lupin's moustache, or dementors flying instead of floating above the ground, etc.), but there are some major problems. First, there are things that are not in the book but came right out of the director's head:   1. Talking shrunken heads (with Jamaican accents for some reason) that seem to be everywhere.   2. Tom, who tends the Leaky Cauldron and is described as stooped and toothless in the book, is now bald with a hump and a limp and acts like some freakish Igor in an old Frankenstein movie.   3. Then there's the infamous first seconds of the movie where Harry is using his wand to practice magic at the Dursley's-- which I don't have to tell anyone who's familiar with the books OR the previous movies is a BIG no-no!  Considering the penalty Harry receives in Book 5 for using his wand outside of school... well, let's just say that a little research would have gone a long way.   4. Then there's the \\"Fat Lady\\"... It isn't the film time that was wasted having the Fat Lady refuse the students entrance to the Gryffindor common room until she could break a wine glass with her voice that's the problem... it's the fact that the SECRET entrance to Gryffindor Tower is (according to Cuaron) right off the main staircase where everyone can see it!!   5. And even though the hippogriff in the movie is as it's described in the book, the other important magical beast towards the end of the movie is absolutely NOTHING like JKR described him (and it would have been a lot scarier if he he had been)!    And now it gets REAL ugly:  Without giving away the ending or twists in the story-- key important bits of information that are revealed in Book 3 are left out!  For instance, the Marauder's Map is given to Harry, but its origin and inventors are never mentioned.  Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban, but how he was able to do it is never revealed.  No mention is made of what James Potter (Harry's dad) and his friends were doing while at Hogwarts or why.  The reason for the Shrieking Shack and the Whomping Willow is never explained.  Why Harry's patronus manifests as a stag is also never explained (even though it does appear as such in the movie).  Such information would have given this movie more depth and is one of the reasons the book is so popular.  It gave a peek into the life of Harry's dad and broadened Harry's world a little.  Without James Potter and his friends doing what they did all those years ago, all the events in Book 3 never would have happened and Harry's third year at Hogwarts would have been as boring as my 8th grade year in Junior High.  Why none of this was included is beyond me.  Had it been, it would have been a much better movie.  **My recommendations:  If you want depth and explanation and a good background story that ties everything together... get the book and read it.  If you just want a good action/adventure movie that you can watch with the kids and not be completely bored out of your mind... get the DVD.  **Parental note:  This movie is rated PG for violence (monsters and ghouly dementors and such) and may be a bit too scary for the little ones.
1401211909|5.0|I first read this book from the library (paperback edition), then I bought one, stood in a long line at the National Book Festival in Washington, DC to have Mr. Gaiman graciously sign to give as a gift to my (then) boyfriend. [Neil's great attitude has made me a bigger fan of his work than I would have otherwise been, and he's since become one of my favorite contemporary authors] Not being able to make it out to see the movie version in theaters has made me very sad, so I thought I would treat myself to this re-issued hardcover. It is beautiful - the entire thing from the cover to the story and the great illustrations, works so well as a finished product - and I only wish I had been able to buy it earlier to have it signed for myself!
B000MV8AE0|5.0|This movie focuses on the last 3 years of Beethoven's life (1824-1827).  While it is likely to be compared to the great film [[ASIN:B00000K3TN Immortal Beloved]], their agendas are different.  Both movies cover Beethoven's triumph of the premiere of his 9th symphony.  This film, however, goes beyond the 9th and focuses on this late string quartets - most of which were rejected by the musical audience of his day.<br /><br />Diane Kruger portrays a fictional character who interacts with Ludwig.  She is his musical copyist who has ambitions to write music in her own right.  While she is technically gifted in music theory and being a copyist, she is missing the Master's innovative touch when it comes to composition.<br /><br />The relationship between the two becomes the center-of-gravity of the film.  Somewhat surprisingly, the movie does not water itself down to becoming some cheesy love story.  Granted, there are a few moments in the film that could be called erotic in nature, but it is a very muted eroticism.<br /><br />There is a slight, oblique parallel with [[ASIN:6304712936 Amadeus]].  Instead of Salieri being buried in the shadow of Mozart, Beethoven belittles a person who belongs to another art:  architecture.  In this case, Beethoven points out that the guy is a not-so-good bridge builder.  That was a curious segment.<br /><br />Ed Harris is every bit as obnoxious, pompous, volatile, ill-mannered, rude and bigger-than-life as we would expect from someone playing the Great Composer.  I have always been a big fan of Ed Harris, and this movie is likely to convert others to admiring Harris' acting prowess as well.  In the special features, Harris reveals that he read up on Beethoven's life and constanly listened to his music in preparation for the role.  It shows!  Diane Kruger is terrific as the young woman who gains Beethoven's friendship.  The fact that she was born in Germany adds to the lustre of the film.<br /><br />This is not a typical biographical film as it pinpoints a particular juncture of the composer's life.  There are only references to other epoch's of his life.  As is always the case with movies that deal with composers, the film has a nice built-in soundtrack!  As a sidenote, people may want to see [[ASIN:B00006L92U State of Grace]] as well.  Little did anyone know when SOG was made that both Ed Harris and Gary Oldman would go on to play the immortal musician - and both do a fine job thereof!ture of the composer's life.

B000QXDED6|2.0|I went to this film expecting a pretty blood bath; I ended up with a pretty film with limited blood and more slow motion scene then a Michael Bay film.  Leaving me bored and waiting for the epic battle in the end, which turns out to be just another cop out.<br /><br />Visually this moves stunning, truly capturing the comic book, the only problem is that it captures it so much that it forgets that it's a film as well and films are time based, that the audience has to watch and wait for every shot not like in a comic book where you can move thought images giving the comic your passing.  Also because the film using only slow-motion for the fight scene it start to be overly apparent that non of the actors can actually fight because the chorography is simply for that one ever so slow swing of the sword leaving digital blood spraying out.<br /><br />The battles though there pretty, are in most situations different from shot to shot, the amount of people change as the director tries to match the comic forgetting again that it's a movie and the people in the back ground need to stay in their places from shot to shot or the characters will be lost in a void.<br /><br />Then that brings me to the character development, I'm not even going to say it's lacking, is just not there.  The characters have nothing to them besides a few \\"witty line\\" that are mostly man lines, and when a character that I'm showed that I should care about dies in slow motion I'm usually waiting for him to hit the ground so I can get on to the next slow shot.  But I do have to give credit to the female character in the film.  She's actually interesting and well worked, why there no slow shots to give her emotion they actually wrote her lines and situation that have emotional backing behind them.  But I do know that these were added in as well and not in the comic again showing that the comic is pretty but isn't a movie.<br /><br />And the true kicker for me was that this film wasn't just boring, it also had a very underlying racist feeling behind it.  Here are the Spartans, our heroes fighting for freedom from the eastern invaders. Spartans are Caucasians and the eastern enemy is everything dark.  Hollywood must have put out a casting call and made two lines, darks and lights.  But if you look at people from those areas the Spartans come from on earth you'll notice that they are actually of darker skin and not Caucasian as a Norwegian. So here I am watch this film getting borage with images of dark people are evil and light skins are heroes and manly men.  But I'm also left thinking but these manly men are no better then their attackers they throw their defective babies away, and are known to be in the slave trade.  But the film say, not do not think of this, remember it is fine to do these horrible things as long as you have something to fight for.  So they fight the dark skins.<br /><br />All this made a film that is racist and boring.  Giving support to a nation of savages simply because they are of light skin and hating the ones that come of darker skin.  Yes the darker ones are attacking but they do give the option of surrender and besides a large tax they would live under the regime quite free.  The only reason I give this film 2 stars is because how pretty it is.t feeling behind it.  Here are the Spartans, our heroes fighting for freedom from the eastern invaders.

B00000ILDE|5.0|One of my all time favorites that I first saw in a theater and have watched on VCR and DVD many times since. Glad to see the restored intro scene where Newt's family rediscovers the aliens (the hard way), because I always enjoy Carrie Henn's scenes. (I know Newt irritates the hell out of some people, but I like the character.)<br /><br />She got her share of quotable (cliched? no, quotable) dialogue, too:<br />\\"I guess we're not leaving, right?\\" (as alien infested shuttle crashes and burns)<br />\\"Why do they tell little kids that?\\" (that there are no real monsters)<br />\\"Can I dream?\\" (closing lines)<br />\\"Aiiieeeeee!\\" (whenever confronted by aliens)
B00005JPMZ|4.0|When I was a kid I was a huge fan of the Turtles watched the live action movies over and over.  But of late pretty much any movie that I liked as a kid is being remade or re-mastered and destroyed in the process.  This new TMNT is one of the first that feels like its being made by a fan.  Written and directed by Kevin Munroe, which shows with the story and action flowing together in most cases seamlessly.<br /><br />The story of the brothers is strong, Leonardo and Raphael hate and love for each other comes off strong leading up to their epic fight.  The rest of the Turtles aren't explored so in deathly but knowing that it's a series and that there will be more, it gives me hope for the writer to explore Donatello and Michelangelo giving them something more then just jokes on their own creation.  With Michelangelo lying on the couch talking while he sleeps, saying \\"dude, dude, dude...\\" and Donatello working Help lines for computers.  Though I find this funny and well written I wish it would go further into their story but I'll wait and hope it comes to that in the next installment of the TMNT.<br /><br />And it comes to the voice action, I found that the Turtles are done with respect, as well as giving these lifeless CGI models life. Even April and Casey done by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans, is done well.  The character that is lost with the voice is splinter (Mako), Mako also does the uncle in Avatar The Last Air Bender and is superb, having the ability to sound spacey but on point at all times.  The only problem is that is not the character of Splinter and when he is demanded to be serious, his voice comes off stale.  Leaving me wanting any scene that Splinter's in to end.<br /><br />Then it comes to the design, I found that at first I was worried not the biggest fan of CGI and a traditional animator myself.  But I found the CGI to be nice stylized with traditional animation technique giving the characters a fluid flow. The Turtles are skinny but seem to make sense to their bodies. But I have to say splinter again look horrible, like a rat put through a washing machine with a Asian looking cloth placed over him.  Along with splinter there are the human, which as skinny, looking as if you punched them in the face they would snap in half with the b bottom half still standing.<br /><br />And the thing that made me excited about it being animated was that the Turtles could actually use their weapons, because though the live action movies are amazing they lack one thing and that's a great weapon fight scene. It's just to hard in the suits, but this movie has them and has them strong, with Leo and Raph about to kill each other.<br /><br />All and all I'm glad that it wasn't just another live action take off, but still gave the character depth.  Their anger and strength come through them as they prepare to fight.  I'm just left disappointed because Splinter isn't the father figure he was in the live action films, he's more of the distant teacher that just shows up.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to any fan and any kid. And to those adults that can go to it as a film that's meant to entertain. 4 stars.r bodies.

B000F7CMRM|2.0|This movie is entertaining. It really is a good thing to watch, but only if you keep in mind that it is a movie. It is not a newscast, not a documentary, its just a movie. I am sympathetic to those who don't want to attack our use of oil for fear of upsetting the economy. But they are taking things too far by claiming its propaganda. Its not, its just a decent movie. That's all. So watch this one and enjoy.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|The latest offering from Nikki Sixx's penchant for doing small solo projects is a testament to not only his talent as a songwriter, but also his range as a musician.  That's not to discount the efforts of guitarist DJ Ashba and singer James Michael (who also mixed the songs).  Nikki has stated explicitly in interviews that this CD was a collaborative effort, and the three men together have put together a great album.  The disc, which is unique for being the first soundtrack for a book I have ever heard of, touts 13 innovative and wonderfully arranged and performed tracks.      The first, seventh and last tracks are spoken entries from what we can assume will be from the book (with accompanying instrumentals).  Judging from the scanned pages included as a CD extra (put this thing in your computer, people!), \\"X-Mas in Hell\\" has been worded slightly differently to make it more sensical out of the book's context.  Its accompanying rock rendition of \\"Carol of the Bells\\" is appropriate and well done.  \\"Intermission\\" with its accompanying music seems somewhat inspired by circus music (and vaguely reminds of Motley Crue's recent Carnival of Sins tour, but maybe that's just me).  \\"Life After Death,\\" wraps up the overall message (drugs can ruin you, but there is always a chance for redemption if you survive) nicely.      Many of the other songs have this element of spoken word as well.  Nikki doesn't sing, so getting to hear his voice is always like a bonus for me, and he's all over this CD.  We hear him to some degree on just about every track, either at the beginning, like with the previously mentioned tracks, or at the end, like in \\"Girl With Golden Eyes,\\" where he reads through the first ten days of his detox with increasing fervor (fantastically, I might add).  Previous to this, my only option for Nikki audio sources was in \\"El Paso\\" on his 58, [[ASIN:B00004T0N4 Diet for a New America]] CD (which I also recommend).        I sampled each of the tracks here on Amazon weeksbefore I got my hands on the CD, and I have to say each sample does absolutely no justice to the full song, which play in order magnificently.  They truly feel like you could be listening to them in the background while reading the book: like a movie score.  \\"Courtesy Call\\" in particular, with it's haunting steady beat, feels like it should be playing on a loop as I read whatever section of the book it is presumably inspired by (and when I find it, I'll do just that).      On the whole, all of the songs seem to be not only themed after parts of the book, but also each set a unique mood or present a particular complicated emotion: \\"Tomorrow\\" is forwarning; \\"Accidents Can Happen\\" is consoling; \\"Heart Failure\\" is ominous; \\"Girl with Golden Eyes\\" is solemn.      The CD is all over the place in terms of style and energy as well.  Not only between songs, but also within them.  \\"Van Nuys\\" starts out awkwardly, but kicks into something that feels completely different: forshadowing, in a way, to the trainwreck we are about to be witness to.   \\"Dead Man's Ballet\\" and \\"Permission\\" (which begins like a country ballad) had this almost gospel feel to them in the chorus parts, particularly towards the ends.  I could seriously picture an all-male gospel chorus in the background, and can only hope to see one if these guys ever decided to take this thing on the road (something we can probably only dream of).     The lyrics seem almost too blunt at times (the furthest metaphor is \\"girl with golden eyes\\" easily substituted for heroin), a fact that often puts me off on music (and a point which might be why the samples do no justice to the songs), but they work fabulously here.  What of the Diaries I have read now, it is just as blunt, and Nikki himself is just as blunt.  They are utterly appropriate and complete the feel of the CD when listened to as a whole.      The singles are also well-chosen.  \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" has actually gotten serious radio airplay (here, at least), and withgood reason!  The song is moving, powerful, and most importantly for a single's success, catchy.  I haven't heard a new Motley song on the radio in years (and incidentally, you don't need to even be a Motley Crue fan to enjoy this CD).  You get the old hits, sure, but the new stuff is always ignored.  It might be because people regard them as an \\"old band that's had all the hits they're ever going to have, so why bother considering anything new,\\" but it might more reasonably be because their style lacks the kind of edge and range that is in vogue now (\\"hair metal\\" out; \\"nu metal\\" in).  Of course, when they've tried to challenge that assumption, they've been railed against by their base as straying too far from who they are, so they're kind of stuck.  Nikki Sixx learned that lesson hard with the '94 album (without Vince) and has avoided doing his edgier work within the confines of the band ever since.  Nikki's former project (before Brides of Destruction), 58, with its fantastically dark, funny, funky style, is the closest to this we've seen from him, though that project didn't have enough radio appeal to make it a hit.  At this point, with this CD, I wouldn't be surprised if the other single, \\"Pray For Me\\" were heard around.      In all, I'd say if you like Motley Crue, particularly Nikki Sixx (and any of his other side projects), you're going to like this CD.  If you like the single, \\"Life is Beautiful,\\" you'll probably like a lot of the other songs on this disc, even though that song is the only one of its kind (high energy/power song; perfect for a radio single).  There's something here for every taste (unless you hate rock music) and, though the language and subject matter can get heavy, the message is a noble one (drug'll kill ya; life is good).      The CD comes with extras: the music video for \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" and a \\"sneak peek\\" of the book, and this isn't any snippet either; for your money you not only get 13 fantastic tracks and a music video, you alsoget 32 full (color) pages scanned from the book.  I'd say money well spent.
B000AP04NI|3.0|I am watching most of the Rodger's and Hammerstein musicals for the first time and I started with \\"The King And I\\" which I really liked. \\"Oklahoma\\" was my second choice and I didn't like it as much. I hate to say it,but there was too much singing in this movie! I know it is a musical,but it seemed like a minute didn't go by without someone bursting into song. I also didn't think most of the songs were all that great! It was nice to see a young Shirley Jones in this beautiful looking film, but it just wasn't for me. If you are a fan I think this 50th anniversay edition is an excellent value with a very good transfer and many extras.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Absolutely loved this film and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of anime.  The choice of voice-over actors was a wise call and the level of animation was second to none.  Highly recommended!
B000E1MTYU|5.0|I already had the standard DVD version. I rate this movie a classic that is Schwarzengger's last Terminator movie & potentially his last movie overall. I also rate Terminator 3 a cut above Terminators 1 & 2. Few movies achieve bringing a mix of humour with action as this movie does not to mention an extremely beautiful woman in addition (that matches Schwarzie \\"blow for blow\\").
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Iam going to make my review short and sweet: This CD is one of the best I have heard. Buy it; you will love it!
0553260111|4.0|Read it on a whim. There is so much more going on than they could portray on film. Don't get me wrong - the movies rock. But the book fills in so much rich background!
B0000931OG|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this CD since I had only heard one of the songs \\"Out of Time\\".  I found it to be exceptionally innovative, and a giant leap forward from clips of other CDs of theirs I heard that were more pop oriented. Creative music on the edge as is U.N.K.L.E and Radiohead.  Check it out.
B000P0J024|4.0|A lost gem brought back to CD life for all of us who remember the brief flowering of this most magical and unexpected of \\"supergroups\\".  Disc 1 is an absolute classic, with Roy Orbison's unique vocals offset by the most expensive band in the world.  Unlike many collaborations Harrison, Dylan, Petty and Lynne have not just given us songs that didn't quite make it to their own albums.  These songs, especially Disc 1 stand up to any in their cannon.  The stand out track is, of course, Handle with Care, but also look for Dylan's Tweeter and the Monkey Man and Harrison's End of the Line.  For copyright reasons all songs are said to be written by The Wilburys.  Disc 3 (there is no Disc 2) isn't quite so stand out, thus the overall rating of 4 stars.  Orbison is missed for the unique quality of his voice.  In places Disc 3 almost sounds like a regular Dylan album, and nothing wrong with that.  For pure fun try The Wilbury Twist, I bet you can't sit down to it.  This record is fun.
1419550969|5.0|I first bought the regular Kaplan GMAT 2007 study guide and it helped me get a general overview of the GMAT questions, format, and some basic practice. But I found that it lacked the most difficult questions (especially in the Quantitative section), and although I got 96% of those right on the practice exams they were far easier than the ones I faced on the real GMAT. So I ended up with a 630 (78th percentile) and was disappointed. I then went out and bought this GMAT 800 book for more practice and \\"the toughest questions,\\" and found it really very useful. It does away with the lengthy text about strategies and gets down to the questions themselves, focusing on different types of tricky questions that the GMAT test makers love to pose. I suppose it worked, since I just took the GMAT again (about 6 weeks later, having only used this book to study for about a week) and scored 750 (98th percentile)!! I highly recommend this, although you need to at least skim through the other one (or a similar guide) first to get the hang of the GMAT format and different question types before using this book.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|You know what to expect from Jack and Meg and this album doesn't disappoint.  It is a return to the form we heard on Elephant.  Get it and play it load.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Simply amazing, this is why they made HD-DVD.  Watch this beautiful series and you will be in awe of all it's splendor. If you own a HD-DVD player this should be the first thing you buy and watch on it. [[ASIN:B000MRAAJW Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD]]]
B000QQH4YS|5.0|It's hard to believe that it's been 20 years since the original Robocop stormed theaters, but here we are.  And now, the classic sci-fi/action film gets the proper Special Edition treatment it so richly deserves (the out of print Criterion Collection DVD is actually superior, but good luck finding it).  As far as the movie goes, we all know by now what happens: Peter Weller plays the slain cop turned police cyborg that seeks to avenge his death against the criminals (both street and corporate level) responsible.  The DVD itself features both the R-rated theatrical cut of the film, as well as the \\"extended\\" uncut edition of the film (also available on the Criterion DVD) which originally received an X-rating in 1987.  There isn't much difference between both cuts; only a few more seconds of bloody splatter, but it's the features which make this DVD set worth owning.  Featurettes on the making of and history of the film with interviews with director Paul Verhoeven, producer Jon Davison, and stars Weller, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and more; as well as looks at the special effects, and the Criterion commentary from Verhoeven, Davison, and writer Ed Neumeier.  All in all, this is one DVD that is worth buying over again if you already own the bare bones edition disc, and it's good to see that the film finally gets the mass DVD treatment it so rightfully deserves.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Great video that brought back memories of a wonderful concert.  Buble is a talent that will be around for a long time.  Good rapport with the audience while belting out some classics.  I was a long time Sinatra fan...with all due respect to Frank, I find Michael Buble very satisfying.
B000UR9T7I|2.0|Despite what the glowing five star review above states, this film is mess.  There are three dance sequences (mary jane making eggs, peter walking streets, and jazz club) there are also two musical numbers (both mary jane). This is just silly and not needed.  The jazz club scene with Peter dancing and playing piano is so close as a nod to Anchorman its awe inspiring, in a bad way.  \\"Dark Spiderman\\" is a waste as well.  The only change is color, emo hairstyle, and pushing a cute russian girl to make him cookies....OOHHH!! During his ONE fight sequence as \\"dark\\" there is no change in spideys abilities or approach.  He might be slightly more aggressive, but thats it.  He states that the \\"power\\" of the suit feels great, but what diffrence did it make.  Spidey doesnt do ANYTHING out of the ordinary than what he did in the first two films strength and ability wise.  Sandman has the best scene of the film when the \\"birth\\" of sandman is displayed.  Outside of that, who cares? He may have a dozen lines througout the whole film.  Raimi said publicly he doesnt like Venom, and it shows.  The character is boring and undeveloped.  And the most ridiculous aspect is the ever growing demasking of everyone who has a \\"secret\\" identity.  In the final fight I couldnt count the amount of times everyone is revealed to the huge number of reporters and cameras below at street level.  And yes, they can see their faces despite the height.  They show a camera  zooming in within a foot of MJs face in the beginning of the scene.  How is it that the enitre world doesnt know who everyone really is?? And what was with the terrible news reporter giving us updates on the fight? My god people, we know whats going on, we paid ten plus bucks for the ticket!! I love the first two films, but this is a mess of obscene proportions.
0761145613|5.0|We've used this calendar for 4 years now to organize activities for working parents and two teen/preteen kids involved in lots of activities. It's easy to see who's activity it is even with multiple events per day.<br /><br />This is the only calendar I've been able to find with this format, one column for each member of the family. Others have a line for each person but you have to fill it out for each week of the month rather than once a month. This one also has more space for each person.<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to get this format with other designs - we like Boynton's silliness but some variety would be nice especially as the kids get older.<br /><br />Last year's calendar included a pocket on the back cover that was a very handy and logical place to store schedule-related info like invitations with directions, tickets to future events, etc. Didn't find one like that this year, I think I'll do a little duct-tape grafting of the pocket onto my new one - publisher, please bring back the pocket!
0312323867|5.0|I loved every second of \\"Something Borrowed.\\" However, if it is possible, Emily Giffin impressed me even more with \\"Something Blue.\\" It was a fantastic story, not just about the love that grows between two people, but moreso about the love you have for yourself. It's about growing, maturing, and becoming an individual. What's great is that you create this love/hate relationship with the main character. Half the time you don't know whether you want to scold her, cry for her, or hug her.     It's truly a fantastic novel that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great book in this genre. There is something so natural, emotional, and simple about the way that Emily Giffin writes. It's really an enjoyable read. I quite literlly couldn't put it down, and now I'm bummed that it is over. I look forward to reading Emily's novel \\"Baby Proof\\" as well as many more novels to come!!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I guess for fans sometimes its hard to accept bands change, although sometimes its for worst, some are for best, if it's bad for a band to put in more effort in a record by singing more than screaming, hitting high notes, great if not drumming at its best, the guitars speak for themselves, this is a record well written as well as developed, how it shows?? on charts, i guess that when you do well in sales it means people like your product, it's easy.<br />when you get to hit on mtv, win awards, it shows that your talent evolves. But sometimes people are hard to convince and expect the band to sound exactly the same as 30 years ago, I'm a Musician myself and honestly as you grow up, you get different perspectives on things, Avenged shows us that concept. I give this record both hands up (with devil horns also)<br />Its great music<br />Can't wait for their new album to hit stores- CAUSE THATS WHEN CHARTS AND SALES GIVE THE RATING, by selling.<br />This is a top notch band. great music, gets you pumped up!! Buy It!!!!!
B000002INR|5.0|Skid Row was probably famous for the lead singer's beautiful blonde hair.  Way to go, Sebastian.  Of course, my hair is blonde, though wavy.  And don't get me wrong - I'm not into dudes - but watchin' S.B. sing as well as he did with that hair (sans Aqua Net), well, it felt real, man.<br /><br />This was the lead singer who wore a shirt that said, \\"AIDS kills fags dead\\" when they played Wimbledon in London, England.  Of course, they banned Skid Row after that, but it made me realize that Skid Row wasn't about to suck up (no pun, please) to the politically correct music industry trying to corral kids into that hippie culture.  These guys were rockers, man, and they rocked it.  Made me proud to love rock AND Reagan.<br /><br />Their debut album, named after the band, rocked in so many ways.  We talked about Sebastian's doo, now to say a bit about the music.  Well, they did what lots of metal bands of the 80s did - they diversified the tracks to show that they were true musicians, not just headbangers.  Each song has lyrics that rock with the tunes, and Rachel Bolen was a fantastic writer.  (Dude had a nose ring connected to his ear by a chain.)<br /><br />The slow songs and the fast songs - each one is anthem to me.  I was proud to be a fan of this band because they were honest and they hit it hard where they needed to, even on the ballads.  And with all those glam rockers (loved their music, but not their style) out there, it was nice to have some real rockers for a change.  (Metallica is my favorite band from the 80s, but they were of course a different breed all together.)<br /><br />If you think you don't know Skid Row, you might be surprised when you buy this album - they got at least 3 songs you should know almost by heart, even if you didn't know it was Skid Row playin' 'em.<br /><br />And if you think you know 80s metal and rock, then you should already have this album.
B00005YUNY|5.0|There have been a lot of reviews on this-mostly positive, apart from one twit who obviously was on another planet. Yes fans will need no further prompting to get this- it's the PERFECT gig, showing Yes music in all it's glory and how the symphonic palette lends itself so admirably to the genre.  So Rick isn't on stage with the band, which is a shame (Rick was on one of his regular 'I want to do something else for a while' trips, and that's fine) but session player Tom Brislin acquits himself admirably, the rest of the band are the musical titans that we all know and love and the material is timeless and classic. Yes, even the new stuff, which I love! I know that 'Don't go' (with it's Beatle-ish vibe) is supposed to have gone down like a lead brick, but I think it's an unackowledged classic, likewise 'In the presence of'. (if you're still complaining, how many other bands have a library of classic tracks of the calibre of Yes? Even at their 'worst', they're better than most bands at their best).  The orchestra are having a ball, and quite right too. As a player myself I know how disheartening it can be to have musos who are 'just doing their job' and going through the motions. The guys and gals here are right into the music, having a ball , and participating in a piece of musical history.  Every time I view this, it reduces me to tears to joy. This is everything a music DVD should be, and then some.  Classic music from THE classic band of all time!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Dexter is a great show that is just so fresh and witty.  It keeps a good pace for analyzing the show while you watch it.  It will leave you thinking about it the next day.  However,  is this a show you need on DVD.  If you like collecting great DVD shows or are a person that loves to watch television series over and over, then yes, this is a good series to buy.  If you are like me though, you will check it out at the local movie rental joint and move on to next season.
B000A59PMO|5.0|The season starts off with Veronica Mars' best friend Lily Kane is murdered. Veronica decides to become a dective to find out who did it.    I love Veronica's personality because she doesn't care what other people think of her and shes not afraid to speak her mind. She always has to crack a joke about everything.    I gave it 5 stars because it's a funny, interesting, laugh out loud tv series. It will make you want to watch show after show to disc after disc.
074356619X|3.0|I believe this product is great for motivation however, their were certain things that I didn't agree with such as; the universe is like a catalog or a genie in a bottle and it can give you endless things! What it's talking about is \\"the law of attraction\\"; meaning that if your desires are strong or powerful enough that you can reach your dreams and goals. To a certain extent it's true; what ever you believe in, can come true in terms of career/goals, material things etc. You have to act upon it and take the appropiate action in order to achieve those dreams and goals. I do agree that if you believe in something so strong that you can make it happen, of course within reason. You take in or receive the good and leave out what you don't agree with what's on the CD, or apply your interpretation. The botton line is to be positive in your thinking instead of having a negative mind.  I believe it's a good listening to keep you motivated but, truely the universe can't give you anything! I don't believe in self healing either.  Theologically/religiously speaking well, this is New Age stuff which you have to be careful how you interpret this CD, DVD or the book. It does have good insight about having a positive mind but their are some speakers that give their own New Age oppinion which are not in line with the Bible scriptures. I can go on explaining but I don't have the time to do so, the bottom line it's all right to get you to have positive thinking! The CD is great for listening in the car while you're stuck in traffic; believe me it can get pretty negative during rush hour.  It will keep you positive during that rush hour time and when you get home with a positive attitude everyone in your household will smile and appreciate you more!

0743496728|5.0|My 16 year old son's English teacher read this book aloud to the class and my son loved it.  It took them four months to finish it but no complaints from him.  He recommended that I read it and I couldn't put it down.  It should be required reading for all high school students.  I realize some may not be able to handle the emotional subject but it would make a lot of them stop and think about the bullying that goes on in school.  I just loved this book and I think Jodi Picoult is the best author in the world!

1401359418|4.0|I bought this book because I heard an interview with Dr. Wiseman on my local National Public Radio station, and I was fascinated with just the idea that luck can be looked at in a scientific study.  And he came across as clever, articulate and funny.  So, what's not to like, right?<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent book and a quick read.  Although it is written colloquially with a self-help focus, he does seem to have done real scientific studies. I was left with a few nagging doubts, however, about how statistically significant really were the differences between those self-defined as lucky and unlucky. And, in one of the early examples he gave contrasting the behavior of a lucky man and an unlucky woman, I wondered if he could account for possible confounding factors that also could explain some behavior differences (like gender).<br /><br />On the plus side, I was reminded of studies done a few decades ago by Pauline Bart (See [[ASIN:0807762121 Stopping Rape: Successful Survival Strategies (Athene Series)]]).  One of her findings was that women who successfully fought off potential rapists tended to have very proactive, problem-solving attitudes.  Likewise, Wiseman found that self-described lucky folks had that same approach to solving their problems.  As a self-defense instructor, I would likely consider recommending some of Wiseman's exercises for some of my students to help themselves change their attitude about \\"luck.\\"
B000A32KJQ|5.0|I was totally blown away by this CD. The compositions are incredible Jan Garbarek's playing is amazing as well as the pianist on the date and Manu's not bad either. I'm really shocked and saddened by other folks who have compared it to smooth jazz. This music has nothing to do with Kenny G, Boney James and the like. But it is melodic, contemporary (and I mean that in the best possible way), jazz done by great improvisers who I think are developing a new language of jazz. I'm an old time ECM listener having bought Eberhard Weber, Jarett, Rypdal, Abercrombie, Towner etc. etc. in the 70' & 80's. And while I've spent the last 15 years listening to other types of music from electronica to neo soul this cd yanked me back to the jazz world because it feels like it acknowledges in a way (not incorporates)all these influences and creates something different. A music that doesn't pander like all those smooth jazz but still manages to challenge while pulling you into incredibly gorgeous compositions.  Check out Rose, November 99, and Number one if you don't believe me. Enjoy!
B00006LSM3|4.0|Much has been made about the fact that Brianwashed was completed by George's son Dhani. Actually Jeff Lynn, long-time Harrison producer, collaborator and fellow Wilbury had more to do with completing the project than Dhani Harrison. None-the-less, the finished product speaks for itself and in my opinion stands alongside other outstanding Harrison albums such as \\"Livng In The Material World\\", \\"33 & 1/3\\", and \\"Extra Texture\\".     \\"Any Road\\" is a minor George Harrison masterpiece, written as only he could have, expressing how life's twists and turns take you on unexpected journeys and adventures. It's the type of song that very easily could have been performed by The Wilburys and is indelibly stamped by Jeff Lynns stalworth rockablliy production style. The title track Brainwashed, like \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Sue Me Sue You Blues\\" represents George at his satirical and synical best. While \\"Devil & The Deep Blue Sea\\" is a light hearted romp evoking a kind of English Music-Hall nostalgia. George loved to play the ukealale and here he gets an opportunity to showcase his affection and prowess on the uke.    Other reviewers have been harsh in their critisim of Brianwashed. Many feel it sounds \\"unfinished\\" and is not up to Georges' high standards. I disagree. Much of the warmth and deep spirtualality that were tradmarks of Harrison's finest works are evident throughout. While it may fall short when compared to \\"All Things Must Pass\\", Brainwashed is hardly a throw-away and deserves to be part of the \\"Quiet Beatle's\\" amazing legacy.
B000O179A4|5.0|It was simply GREAT, FANTASTIC!!!!  Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy was simply delightful and magnificent in their roles.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head have created a masterpiece. This how Thrash Metal should sound like. I can not get enough of The Blackening. All aspects of this CD are awesome Guitars, Bass , Drums and Vocals are perfect. I have listened to more than 10,000 Metal CD/Records. This has to be in my top 10. Let the Blackening Begin \m/!
B00005JPFC|5.0|This year's Pixar film Ratatouille is a much needed improvement over last year's Cars. Unlike Cars, this movie was energetic, exciting, and funny. Remy the rat is a likeable character with a dream of becoming a big time chef. His moment comes when he is separated from his family and is led to Chef Gusteau's once Five Star resturaunt. He then meets Linguini, and that's where the fun begins. This movie was amazing and a thrill to watch. If i had had time, i would have seen it again. This movie is the bomb!
B000OLGCHA|3.0|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a great soundtrack.  But this one was not.  It rambled all over the map.   Did not follow any kind of order.  I've enjoyed all the soundtracks, continuing to replaying them over and over.  This one had some good tracks but nothing outstanding.  I was so looking forward to it and to be let down so disgusted me.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|I hesitated to listen to Unearth for awhile for some reason, but I regret that after hearing this CD.  I found that this is quality work.  Although this band is categorized as metalcore, they have a definite melodic death metal influence as well, especially on tracks like Black Hearts Now Reign and most obviously on Zombie Autopilot, which sounds extremely similar to In Flames.    The negatives?  I personally prefer more clean vocals and more coherent screams, but this is just me, and the Rage Against the Machine-esque chants that appear in just about every track don't seem to fit in well to this style of music.  Overall, a must have for any metalcore or melodeath fan.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Is this an accurate depiction of Frida's life?  I have no idea, and I don't care.  This movie is an intelligent, interesting, and beautiful piece of art in its own right.
032147404X|5.0|One of the other reviews complained about the guy's sense of humour.  I must admit in the introduction chapter he lays it on thick and it has nothing to do with the idea of the book at all.  Just flick through that and get to the detail.    Personally I really liked this book.  It breaks into practical chapters (taking pictures at weddings, taking landscape pictures, taking portraits, taking sports pictures)  the exact things that people like me are interested in taking better pictures of.  That is what it does, it tells you tricks to get better pictures.  He suggest some essential items, some straight forward tips, helps you understand why sometimes you're not getting the pictures you want.    This is for a beginner to SLR photography.  Not for an experienced photograper.  But it's easy to use, easy to read, broken into small sections with a few tips.  You will get better pictures after using this book.      He leans a little heavily on Photoshop, but if you really want to take this serious then I guess Photoshop is going to become your best friend anyway!    Now i'm ready for a more advanced book, but this was a great starting point for me.
B000000WF0|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but to those who claim their is only one hit on this cd ..well you need to get your ears checked!  This album is quite possibly one of the best ever released during the 90's for this genre. I consider myself quite picky when it comes to purchasing music and this is one of my all time favorites.  Ashcroft's voice sounds surreal and hallucinatory as if his voice were one of the instruments.  Buy this cd, hit play, close your eyes and prepare for a musical journey like no other.  Do yourself a favor and buy this cd ...NOW!
B000RJO58M|5.0|Loved this movie in theaters, so when it came to DVD in the HD DVD/DVD combo pack I had to get it so I could play it in HD DVD and my sister could borrow it for her regular player.  Sound and picture are gorgeous and the movie itself is as funny as I remember.  Also enjoyed the look at Nick's notebook and the outtakes bonus features.  Haven't had a chance to go through all the extras, but will at some point.  I heartily recommend this movie for a new British twist on the old American buddy-cop shoot-em-up genre (with a little Godzilla thrown in).
B000KP62MA|5.0|This cd/dvd edition of \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is over all my all time favorite album. The dvd has all the extras that fulfill your needs in appreciating their award winning video \\"The Kill\\". The video, making of the video, live footage, trailers, and and the mind blowing cd is a great buy.

B0000009SG|5.0|As promised in the title I will keep this review short and sweet (much like this album).  A lot of reviewers are going on about how this album showcases all facets of Zappa's musical genius.  I disagree.  This is hardly Zappa's deepest album musically or lyrically.  A lot of people have said this album includes examples of Frank's \\"jazz\\" prowess - which isn't accurate, in my opinion.    This album is Frank's most commercial, to the point, rock/pop album ever released.  This album does NOT showcase Frank's most complex arrangements, his jazz majesty or the depth of his varied musical influence.......etc., etc.  This is a straight forward rock/pop Zappa album.  But there is no shame in that.  It is a great Zappa album,.....full of well written songs, mean guitar solo's, humor, satire, catchy riffs and tight musicianship.  It is a great listen and very accessible to the new Zappa listener (maybe the most accessible album for a newbie Zappa listener).  It doesn't have the jazz prowess or complex arrangements of Hots Rats, Waka Jawaka or The Grand Wazoo,....nor does it have the lyrical brilliance of Joe's Garage or You Are What You Is.  But what this album does have is 7 catchy rock/pop songs that feature high end musicianship and humorous lyrical content.  This and Apostrophe are the perfect starter set for the new Zappa listener.  This album is an essential part of any Zappa collection,.....or any rock music collection for that matter. If you love great rock music and top notch musicianship, then this album should already be in your collection.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As a documentary, Planet Earth may not be perfect but it comes close. As a spectacle, its simply spectacular. More importantly, you don't mind its sleight-of-hand and occasional vagueness in the commentary because you are almost constantly overwhelmed with the quality of the image, the novelty of the presentation and the technical wizardry associated with various time-lapse sequences, for example.    And even if the commentary sometimes has the weakness of most nature documentaries (serious but long discussions essentially setting the stage for the money shot, typically a top predator making minced meat out of fluffy), it still manages to interest consistently, not just with sights of almost extinct animals but also with rarely seen, beautiful footage (swimming monkeys, blooming baobabs at night, water returning to the parched savanna...).    So what if you hear one time more than necessary about the greatest migration ever (fill in appropriate species), the percentage of the earth covered by the geographic topic-du-jour or the fact that the animal on screen is invariably a (fill in appropriate moniker)-specialist ?    You will see a lot that is not banal, not seen before, and certainly not like this.     In addition, this Blu-Ray transfer honors the new high definition format. When you purchase a Blu-Ray drive -and I imagine an HD-DVD too- it does not take long to realize that many commercial discs have a quality barely better, if at all, than regular DVD. In particular, if you own a now relatively standard DVD with up-conversion, your standard DVD discs will look very good. In many cases, a good standard DVD, upconverted, will look as good or better than a so-so BD.    Not so with Planet Earth on Blu-Ray. To put it simply, if you are new to high-definition, you have never seen this before. This is not a feeling you will automatically have with all BD releases. And once the technical magic has sunk in, you are still left with a lot of new images, and food for yourthought.
1401211909|3.0|A charming book.  Not very deep, but a nice quick read.  A small English town  borders a magical gateway into the land of Faerie.  A young man, half of this world, and half of that, falls in love with a fallen star (which turns out to be a girl).  The two adventure a bit together and finally they live happily ever after.  One more thing - the movie is actually better than the book.  That doesn't happen to frequently, but I actually enjoyed the movie more.
0689835604|3.0|My daughter is always amazed by lift the flap books. This series covers the topics toddlers and preschoolers are discovering. My daughter has to look under each flap and could be happy owning every single book in this series. I recommend this series as a gift to new moms and a child's birthday. Boys and girls will enjoy them.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I love how they mixed up alot of the songs and gave them a new spin. I first heard Strawberry Fields Forever played on the radio and thought this was a special version. Luckily the DJ said it was from the LOVE CD, so I found it online and ordered it. I was hoping the DVD that came with it was a video DVD, but it's only audio, so next time I would just buy the CD. If you love the Beatles you should add this to your collection.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|One of the best movies around, but too unknown.  Joss Whedon did a great job taking you on a roller coaster ride.
B000RJO578|4.0|Hot Fuzz is the second comedy collaboration featuring actors Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Writer/Director Edger Wright.  There First collaboration, Shaun of the Dead was revered as one of the smartest comedic horror movie of it's time and has a huge cult following.  I remember stumbling on the film in the theater and thought the movie looked kind of interesting and saw it by myself at a midnight showing I walked out of the theater at 2am wanting to run back and watch it again. The smartest comedy, not written by the Coen brothers, maybe ever.  Hot Fuzz has a lot to live up to.  \\"Shaun\\" was one of those unique comedies that gets funnier after every viewing and it appears that Hot Fuzz has that same attribute.<br /><br />This is a nice follow up to a genius piece of work and although it falls short of the Shaun of the Dead type brilliance (any follow up would fall short) it still is quick, witty, funny and to my surprise, gory!  This film is just a lot of fun, director Edger Wright just has such a style and charisma to his films that just resonates in me.  His style really fits this type of movie.  Simon Peg and Nick Frost are the new comedy due that play wonderfully off one another.  It's hard to imagine one without the other.  I'm sure I won't fully appreciate this film till I view it another 3 or 4 times but as of now it's a great comedy that everyone should run out and buy.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I have enjoyed this new CD of Michael's.  I think the order of songs seems strange to me, like it doesn't flow from one song to another well.  But the songs themselves, all familiar, are very nice.  He has a couple of twists on old favorites that are preferable to the old ones for me.  His voice is so smooth and even and he can really belt it out.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Ok, the first question you must ask yourself is, \\"Do you like the Coen Brothers?\\"  Raising Arizona, Fargo, O' Brother where art thou, Do you like these movies.  Well if you like their unique take of life and colorful characters then you also like this one.  This has a lot of the same actors that are in most Coen Bros stuff and all of them are played to utter perfection.  There is not a miscue to be found in these performances.  The biggest problem this film had when it was realized is it was the Coen's follow up film to their Oscar winning Fargo.  Many people who loved that movie were not Coen fans, went and saw this one, and didn't have the same appreciation for what this movie was suppose to be.  This is one of the funniest movies you will ever see and is only equaled by other Coen movies. It's unlike Fargo is this is a niche film that will only be liked by a select few that \\"get\\" what it's about.<br /><br />\\"The Dude\\" played by Jeff Bridges is an aging old California hippie that just wants to bowl and smoke pot but finds himself caught up in a complex kidnapping plot of Someone's wife that shares his last name.  John Goodman plays the \\"dudes\\" best friend and is one of the funniest characters in the film.  This is one to watch over and over.  Like many smart comedies the jokes in this film are muti-layered and found only funny after a second or third viewing.  Sometime it goes right over your head.<br /><br />The Dude is such a great character you can't help but love him.  Don't we all wish we could walk though life as clueless as the Dude...I know at times I wish I could.  At first viewing I didn't get a lot of it's \\"jokes\\".  I've seen this film about 10 times and feel like it's a truly remarkable character study due to the writing and brilliant acting. I can't watch it without having to stop it because I'm just laughing my ass off at the subtle brilliance displayed by these characters. The Dude abides.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I have enjoyed Norah's new CD and would recommend it.  I will say that it is slower than her former CD's and tends to make me sleepy, which is either good or bad depending on when I listen to it.  And it isn't just mellow like her others, but slower.  But her familiar melodies are there, and her smooth voice.
B00005JPCF|2.0|The movie was an environmental film that tried hard to get in a message with little story being the result.  I gave it 2 stars just because the \\"latino penguins\\" added a small bit of much needed humor.  Basically a penguin gets exiled by the leading \\"pastor penguin\\" because he dances and in his journey he discovers how mankind are destroying the planet.  He then dances for the humans and their hearts begin to open to the fact that they should stop fishing and stealing all the penguins fish.    And that's about it.
0143038419|4.0|A WONDERFUL INSIGHT TO A WOMANS HEART AND SOUL.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  SOMETIMES A LITTLE REDUNDANT, ESPECIALLY IN INDIA....BUT IT TRULY WAS A JOURNEY.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Das Leben der Anderen (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.<br /><br />It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he - who sadly died in July 2007 of stomach cancer) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christa-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Stasi plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Wiesler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Wiesler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.<br /><br />The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored by Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 07he artists' venture.

B000RW3VD4|5.0|\\"Wall Street\\" is a movie that seems to spark much debate. Basically, it is the working out of a moral struggle within young Wall Street trader Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) between the values with which he was raised of hard work and success through actual creation, versus those of his mentor Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) who succeeds through corporate raiding and \\"creative destruction\\". From Bud's viewpoint his dad's (Martin Sheen) roadmap for success and happiness seems old-fashioned to the point of being prehistoric compared to Gekko's, until Gekko sets his sights and his wrecking ball on his father's company, and Bud is forced to choose. Many people associate this with a liberal versus conservative viewpoint on business, a wild-west economy versus a planned economy and relegate this film to 1980's era nostalgia, like the now humorously giant cell phone Gekko is talking on as he walks along the beach. It is said that neither extreme works and that we've gradually settled towards something in the middle. However, the Gekkos of this world are smarter than that, and over the past 20 years have set up an economic system that serves them well. What we now have is a situation where the haves and have-mores have a planned - almost Soviet - system in which the rules stratify them at the top. I cite the changes in bankruptcy law as exhibit A. The labor force that serves them, however, are in the wild-west economy that was once advocated for everyone. Some will rise to the stratified top in this situation, but the vast majority will remain at the bottom shooting it out with each other - for scarce good jobs, good health care, education, etc. Thus, to me, Wall Street is just an opening chapter in the saga of how economic forces and attitudes toward them have changed, not the portrait of a 20 year-old fad that has come and gone.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|The story is extremely interesting. A writer is selected like so many to be investigated were because he has run against a high party official who wants his girlfriend. While under investigation he turns out that he is engaging in some subversive activities. It is at this point to me the story started to seem unbelievable that a secret policeman in Eastern Germany would get so involved with this writer and his girlfriend that he would cover up for him and that he could as it is not like those secret policeman were trusted by the state either. They had people looking over them too. Still it is a movie.    The characters are well developed and come across well.  I particularly liked the suicide scene. The acting is good.     The filming is good enough.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Gave this movie 5 stars for being so original from the copy cat contemporary movies we see today.  This movie is totally mind expanding imaginary twilight zoneage to say the least.  Great story line, awesome images, disturbing special effects and good acting.  To all morons who gave this movie less stars then it deserves, let's see you jerk offs create your own original movie, you no talent critical jealous bums. It seems some people can only feel good about themselves by tearing down others, so they can build themselves up.  To all people who gave this one star, I give you -10 stars for being jealous, hateful, self-centered, moronic, small minded, egostical twerps. (GET A LIFE PEOPLE).  This movie is one of my all time favorite horror classics, for originality.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|This 1993 movie was suggested to me by my Amazon friend, C. Christopher Blackshere.  He was so right! This film has just become one of my all time favorites!  If you like \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" and \\"Alien\\", then this is definitely for you.  It has one twist though---it is based on a true story of an alien abduction that happened on November 5, 1975.  A group of loggers headed by Mike (Robert Patrick), were working on a government contract clearing out part of the forest in the White Mountains (near Snowflake, Arizona).  They had to finish the job within a short time, so they worked into the night.  While returning to their small town, the 6 men saw a \\"fire in the sky\\".  They thought it maybe a forest fire and realized that the road they were on was the only one in or out of the forest.  Mike pulled the truck over to get a better look.  Travis (D.B. Sweeney), got out of the truck and ran to the \\"fire\\" despite the other guys trying to persuade him to stay in the truck.  It turned out to be this incredibly large UFO.  Travis was looking at it while the other guys are just screaming at him to get back in the truck.  The UFO \\"zaps\\" him and they figured he was dead.  Mike returned a short time later to look for his body, but didn't find one.  They told their story to the local police and an investigator (James Garner).  The remaining 5 guys were being interviewed on a murder charge, as no everyone believed their story.  They all agreed to take a lie detector test which they all passed.  Travis returned five days later without having any food or water and was severely dehydrated and was taken to the hospital.  The last part of the movie, deals with his ordeal of being kidnapped, taken away and having medical experiments done to him by aliens.  This movie kept me on edge the entire time!  I NEVER was bored!  The last 10 minutes of this movie terrified me more than any horror film I ever saw.  It is the best thrill ride you could ever be on, at the expense of Travis Walton.  Buy it and watch it, I highly recommend it!ravis Walton.  Buy it and watch it, I highly recommend it!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Renee Zellweger hits all the right notes as Beatrix Potter, a single woman from an upper-class family who flaunts the customs of her day by publishing children's books and falling in love with her editor.  The beginning of the movie is told by flashbacks which show that Beatrix was a precocious painter and storyteller during her childhood.  As an adult, she chooses not to marry and instead she writes and illustrates children's books.  Her mother never acknowledges her success, but instead worries about proprieties and social standing.  When Beatrix falls in love with her editor, her parents object to the match because they deem their daughter's fiance to be beneath her socially.  Much of the film is shot in England's Lake District which makes a breathtaking background for the film.  Whether it is historically accurate or not, the film is charming and is highly recommended for anyone who loves Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter's other books.
1594489505|5.0|I could not put this book down.  In addition to the historical aspect, I thought the introspection concerning the relationships that exist between women was very profound.

0790729350|4.0|I was so enthusiastic when I finally had the privilege to see this, the Director's Cut of WOODSTOCK, a loveletter to the famous concert that took place in 1969  at Max Yasgur's 600 acre (2.4 km²) dairy farm in the rural town of Bethel, New York from August 15 to August 18, 1969.  What a generous man Mr. Yasgur was, and what lucky music fans we are, all of these years later, to have the highlights of that concert documented through film footage.  All of the great musicians of that time are featured here (and then some).  They include Richie Havens, Ravi Shankar, Melanie, Janis Joplin, Carlos Santana, Canned Heat, Janis Joplin, Jo Cocker and Jimi Hendrix.  Of course, this concert is synonymous with the incomparable rendition of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" that Hendrix played, perhaps ironically as an ode to war, destruction and social injustice in the wake of war and destruction, with great gusto and expression on his guitar.<br /><br />What is particularly intriguing and notable, for me, is the distinctive use of \\"side-by-side\\" shots to depict set-up and the technical \\"behind the scenes\\" aspects of what was involved on the production side of Woodstock, along with footage of the musicians who were featured there.  I won't lie to you.  There were segments that dragged for me--it may have been the way in which it was shot, or, just that some of the numbers didn't grab me (though, I am sure there are many die hard Woodstock fans who would argue with me to the grave on this one).  We also experience (if vicariously) what attendees experienced while at the festival at their height (complete with footage of recreational drug use, nudity, and the bond that grew between those who all came together to be a part of musical history, during three unforgettable days).  I definitely reccomend WOODSTOCK because it's an incomparable time capsule and depicts a time in history rich in cultural expression, as well as social unrest.
0385341067|5.0|I have been reading avidly for over 40 years and this is the first book I have ever finished and turned immediately back to the beginning to start again. The other reviewers have covered plot and content - all of which are excellent, my enthusiasm is with the writing - if writing can be called 'gorgeous' this is. I want to eat this book. Thank you so much Mr Jones. A fantastic, intelligent, thought provoking, funny, treatise of our complicated humanity.
B000002U9L|5.0|This is an electrical and fantastic soundtrack of the wonderful fantasy movie of 1986, starring Jennifer Connoly and DAvid Bowie, Labyrinth.<br /><br />From start to finish it is electrical and rich in fantasty rock and some electronic instrumental music too.<br />This album includes the beautiful song of loneliness and hope, Underground, the catchy and super Magic Dance, the fun and cheeky Chilly Down, the gentle As The Wall Falls Down and the romantic Within You.<br />This album was proof that Bowie was still one of the greatest talents of the musical world by 1986, and had lost none of his ability to create beautiful and enchanting music.<br />David Bowie is a living legend.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This may very well be Pixar's best film and that's no small feat.   I can't believe they could come up with such and incredible movie based on quiet a disgusting subject matter but there is no question the people at Pixar have pulled it off.  Ratatouille and the Toy Story movies are the only computer animated movies I can remmember in which I've found myself smiling from begging to end. My favorite scene was probably Remy cooking two omelettes, a large one for his friend, a small one for himself.  I love the fact that, unlike every other animated movie today, Pixar's have no current pop references and also unlike them, they will stand the test of time.   To learn the insipid Shrek 3 made more money than Ratatouille is frankly puzzling and I for one can not find any explanation whatshoever.
B000T433L0|5.0|************* Spoiler may hit you **********  I wonder if Martin is a psychologist. Mind-blowing acting by De Niro. Slow motion camera at its best. Travels deep into the mind of lonely man and his dangerous transition into sociopath. The camera and motifs are enough to do this job. Full of motifs - Empty hallway and 'You talking to me'. Depressing story of a lonely man who finds self-esteem in rescuing a underage teenager and by killing a aspiring political leader. However the movie doesn't tell why this young man becomes psychopath in the end. May his war past ? The violence in the end is disturbing ! The guy has Sczhiotypal personality traits and some type of paranoid delusions (other are out there to get others) possibly.    Hats of Martin scorsese for his amazing direction (and acting in his short role in the film. Maybe he triggers the malevolent side of Taxi driver in the movie !)        Don't miss this master piece
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|Why do people talk a big game on this pile of puke. I'd call this garbage, but that would be an insult to real garbage. The music is basically written in the generic \\"Look we have passion and real emotion\\" but that really means that we tried to write an album but we just can't escape the generic lyrics our fans want to get shoved down their throats. I have looked at the lyrics to this album and really find it amusing that people think they have talent(which they really don't) and they can play better than many bands. \\"But they have solos now\\" they add, but they are not too impressive and basically novice like. Overall, I hope emo fades soon, but the good thing I'm starting yo see a decline in the popularity of emo and soon it will all end.

0743298020|4.0|just the name gets you! but as you get near the center of this spider's web, the hold you feel is much stronger then one might expect. Especially as you sense the story's beginning might come back and haunt the end.<br /><br />~ bradley
B00005JO20|3.0|Even after suspending disbelief to get into this movie's world, you have to keep on going.  How she keeps from breaking her neck, or even getting whiplash, is amazing.  Why can't Kong get around the wall with all of his amazing abilities?  What do the natives do for a living -- that is, when they aren't offering people who drop by as sacrifices to Kong?  Farm?  Do embroidery?  (And the scenes with them doing a sort of drugged dance was really worth a chuckle.)  All that said, it's entertaining.  And most of the unbelievable (in the movie's own world) stuff is in a way fun to see.  So I gave it 3 stars.  It's worth about $5 to see.  (I'm very glad Peter Jackson was much more careful with The Lord of the Rings movies.)
1552091090|1.0|I bought this book because so many people raved about it. That should've been a sign, I guess. I read it once to my son, and half way through the story he says: \\"That mother is scary. I don't like her.\\" I agreed 100% with him. It's unnerving and creepy. I know what kind of message the author was trying to convey, but I don't agree with the way he approached it. I'm out in left field with this one. I don't understand what all the raving is about.
075640407X|3.0|I liked it, but it wasn't exactly as good as I was expecting.  Every few chapters I got kind of irritated with the lack of anything actually HAPPENING.
B000OVLBGC|1.0|I rented the film, with much anticipation. After a few minutes of viewing, I realized that there was no way to understand what was going on due to the offensive way Sony has subtitled the movie. One word every minute, with no particular criteria. So, if you don't speak German, save yourself a big frustration. I can see films in Spanish, French, Italian and English. But German, unfortunately, no. I will wait for a new edition, possibly Criterion.  Carlo Chiarenza
B000089RV6|1.0|I really don't get it, Why do people give Foreigner, Metallica, Dire Straits, Van Halen and many others 1 star and give the awful bands like ACDC, The Rolling Stones, U2, The Doors, and Queen 5 stars? That really isn't true. To this album now, it is horrible. The lead singer screams a lot and the words are disturbing ''YOW!!'' BAH IA M BA A A A HA A AK BA CK IN BLA CK.\\"\\"\\" Why do people like this CD so much??? This is the most overrated CD of all time and I think this CD should go die!! If you are considering purchasing this awful s#$t, you should read the 1 star reviewers. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A MUCH BETTER CD, GET METALLICA, ZZ TOP, GEORGE THOROGOOD, VAN HALEN, DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, AND JOE SATRIANI AS THEN YOU WILL BE HAPPY. Thanks for listening, For Whom the Bell Tolls

B0007OCG4W|3.0|Wow, what an exhausting movie about some really f**ked up people.  Just when you started to root for a character they would do something so base and digusting you would just sit there in shock.  The dialoge is great, thanks to this being an acclaimed stage production, the performances are good, Clive Owen the stand out, he was exceptional.  Im really not sure id recommend this movie, it's so depressing, and what it says about these four losers is not pretty, but on the other hand the performances are good, the dialoge well written and i liked the fact is is shot on location in London...really up to you, but be prepared to be very frustated, these four are idiots of the highest order and deserve each other, I really hate to think that anyone could be as horrible as any of these four.
0553588486|5.0|There isnt much more to say that hasnt already been said about this fantastic series.  The only point I'll make is when I decided to read this series the first three books were on the market with the remaining books still unwritten or not published yet.  I typically don't like to start reading multi-book sagas that are unfinished because I hate the thought of investing time in something that has no end yet because a) the author may get distracted by other projects and never finish the series b) the series will finish on a disappointing note leaving the faithful readers with an unsatisfied conclusion or c) the series will be completed but it will take eons for it to be written and published.  Some readers may actually enjoy the uncertainty and the wait and I respect that.  For example, Harry Potter fans have stuck with the series book by book but it seems to me that those books were written and published on a regular interval and has recently concluded with much fanfare.  This series is a bit different in that no one has any idea when the next installment will be released and the end is not in sight.  Having said that I still decided to pick up the first three books based on the rave reviews and read each one with great dedication. My thinking was that as I read the first three books, the fourth will be published and the fifth would follow shortly thereafter.  Now I'm regretting my decision because its been a few years since I finished Book 3.  Book 4 is out now and has gotten mixed reviews (see b above).  The series has expanded to a 6th book and there is no target date in the near or distant future for them(see a and c above).  So before you decide to spend your time reading these books think about whether your ok with the three scenarios mentioned earlier.  If you are then go for it and enjoy as it is certainly one of the finer fantasy reads out there (for the first three books).  If not, then I would think twice before diving in.<br /><br />UPDATE (Sept 2008) - Nothing has changed.  Still waiting for Book 5 and no one (including the author according to his webite) has any inkling when it will ever be finished.  Of course, when or if the book is ever completed thats not even the end of the series.  There's still another book that has to be written!  I'll check back in a few years...maybe by then Book 5 will have been released and then everyone will be playing the waiting game for Book 6.<br /><br />UPDATE (Nov 2009) - Out of morbid curiousity I decided to check in to see if Book 5 had been released yet or if there was an anticipated release date.  I am not surprised that the answer is NO and there is no hope in sight.  The good news is that the Fire and Ice books which I read a long time ago are a distant memory meaning that I really don't remember much about the storylines, plots or characters anymore and consequently I'm happy to say I have no attachment to this series anymore.  Even if Book 5 came out next week and got rave reviews (highly unlikely) I would not read it because I would be setting myself up for another long, drawn out wait for the next installment.  No thanks, I'll pass.has changed.  Still waiting for Book 5 and no one (including the author according to his webite) has any inkling when it will ever be finished.

B0002I831S|4.0|There are more erudite and expertise opinions in the other reviews about the detail of each of the episodes in Season One. Suffice it to say, I bought this set for my wife, a long-time trekkie, and we have all (including 2 x teenage sons, who had not seen these - being Voyager/Next Generation fans) thoroughly enjoyed the episodes. Great re-mastering (quite astonishing video quality actually considering the age of the episodes), 5.1 sound, and well put together. And at the current Amazon price, an absolute bargain. Highly recommended.
0374105235|5.0|A great first book and one from the heart of Ishmael.  Not only is war bloody and distructive, but look at the effects on the child soldiers of Sierre Leone.  They become inhuman, living, taking drugs, and killing.  Ishmael describes both being the recipient of this behavior and also doing it to others.  He talks about slitting a person's throat in a contest, shooting rebels in combat and captivity, and then having some prisoners buried alive.  This is nasty stuff and shows the inhumanity of the people who performed this behavior.  The child soldiers can be blamed for some of this, but the real leaders (like former Liberian president Charles Taylor) and RUF must also be blamed.  They instituted this genocide.<br /><br />This is one man's journey from childhood to inhumanity to humanity.  These child soldiers need love and nourishment, and not the torment of bad leaders.  This story depicts man's inhumanity to man.
B000RJO578|5.0|Overall its a great film, there are plenty of extras, and all on one disc. I don't just mean extras separate to the movie, there are lots of in jokes, which may be a little bit of the problem with some people not finding some things funny. One thing I found not funny after purchasing the DVD, was the partially confirmed rumour that HOT FUZZ is coming out on a multi-disc version later this year, one reference can be found in the current commentary on this release where Simon Pegg refers to the \\"other commentary\\", well there is only one.And I completed a survey which refers to a Multi disc version coming out on a specific date.  Anyways, its clear that the guys are experimenting with development, since a bigger budget allows this, as well as getting Edward Woodward, although I did not spot Edward until I read the credits went back and saw who Tom Weaver was... seems like Edward is the Frenetic star you have when you just want a damn fine actor. And the other key point is that they have some of Britains finest Thespians.  The Movie, the Comentary, the Text info track, and etc all mean many hours of repeat watchings.  ENJOY
1400032717|5.0|This story is told throught the eyes of Christoper, a 15-year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome, and as such it breaks all the rules of how a good book is supposed to be written.  The thoughts run on and the story wanders off on constant tangents where Christopher describes events and settings in excruciating detail.  But by doing so, it gives a clear picture into the workings of the protagonist's mind.  He lives in a world where other people are to be avoided and feared, touching is an agony, and any little change in routine is profoundly unsettling.  His world is all trees and no forest -- actually, all branches and leaves and twigs; detail devoid of context, where every little thing has exactly the same level of priority.      There is absolutely no nuance in this boy's life ... and yet the book is profoundly nuanced, and that is what captivated me.  For the story is not just about the boy himself.  It's also about the havoc his condition wreaks on the lives those around him, particularly his parents, who love him deeply but usually don't know what to do with him.  Caring for him is difficult - he wanders off, hits anyone who touches him, and melts down completely when he is overwhelmed, which is frequently.  Shopping trips and family vacations are obstacle courses.  And yet, for all their devotion, his parents never get back what most of us would consider the rewards of parenthood, because he never shows affection, gratitude, or joy.      Even though we only see the parents through Christopher's dispassionate, or sometimes fearful, reporting, I was deeply moved by the portrayal of a boy trying to cope with a world that seems completely strange to him, and by the people who love him trying to cope with him.  This book is a rare and wonderful accomplishment.
055358894X|3.0|I enjoyed the last quarter of the book better than the first three quarters.  The first half was a mix of back story and slow pace storyline.  The back story could have been better had the author had some point to its vast detail but there wasn't.  It even missed stuff like the love of Locke's life, Sabetha who is eluded to many times but you never actually see her ever.  It lengthened the book but did nothing for the storyline.  He didn't even seem to have fun with it.  But the last quarter is where its most tense and moves fastest.  For the last quarter  I will buy the next one because I hope we got all the backstory done although I doubt it.  He couldn't hold intensity in the book at all and it was a bit of a chore to read it until it got good.  If you want a better book that will hold you through read Mistborn.  Locke is a great character but the editing of scenes could have been much better.
B000EGCITG|5.0|OK... I have to admit up front that, prior to this CD, I never listened to Pink.  I just assumed that she was another one of the gaggle of brainless, talentless \\"musicians\\" that somehow garner the airplay and the money while truly talented singer/songwriters go unnoticed and unappreciated.  It wasn't until I happened to catch the video for \\"Stupid Girls\\" and appreciated the irony and the attitude that I even gave her a chance and got this CD.    I am totally blown away!    \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is reason enough to buy this.  It's a beautiful song, Pink sounds great accompanied by The Indigo Girls, and lyrically... as many reviewers have previously pointed out... it is one of the most pointed and intelligent critiques of the Bush administration that I have heard in any medium.  I have to imagine that Michael Moore has this on his iPod.    The whole CD is just amazing.  Pink manages to come off as intelligent while irreverent, confident yet self-depricating, sporting a major attitude and yet being completely grounded and possessing utter humility.  While the lyrics aren't always poetry, they always make a point, and the listener is never left wondering what she had on her mind at the time.    I give Pink the utmost credit for being her own person, making her own music and not looking to apologize for sharing what's on her mind.    But then, she has no reason to.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wasn't really a \\"fan\\" of this series while it was on the air. I looked forward to seeing it, and was sorry (but not surprised) when it was canceled; mostly because, for some, it would seem too slow paced. I bought the series after seeing the movie \\"Serenity\\", and came to appreciate how truly good it was. I'm not a fan of Buffy, and maybe saw most of an episode of Angle; I'm still not particularly impressed with either. But Josh Whedon and crew hit a homer with this series. It has interesting, engaging and well developed characters, as well as well developed stories.     As far as comparing the movie Serenity with the TV series, it depends on what you like. The movie is fast paced and geared toward \\"flash.\\" The show took more time to develop a plot. After seeing both a few times, I find I like the series better. As some reviewers have pointed out, it has more heart. Both are above par.
B000A2XC1C|1.0|I don't know how this movie got under my Dudley Moore radar. I am a fan of all His work going back to \\"Beyond The Fringe\\", and I never saw this movie until now. I'm not so much disappointed in Dudley Moore, but the writer and director. What an embarassment to this great comedic actor! Why they couldn't have written a better part for this man is the question[why Dudley accepted the role is another]. My guess is that He was too nice of a guy-which Dudley was-to walk off the project. Ridiculous[and UN-FUNNY]lines they have Him say and His supporting cast is the worst[or at least their parts were written/directed terribly also]. This looks like a role that the younger Dudley Moore may have had, like his role in Alice in wonderland-20 years earlier, but not after Dudley had risen to the heights he had[\\"Foul Play\\",\\"10\\", \\"Arthur\\",etc.]. I truly wish I had not seen this film. I found it to be degrading to a comedic actor of Dudley Moore's caliber. God Bless Him for being a nice guy and agreeing to be part of this lame and WEIRD version of the Santa Clause story. To me, it would be like an Ex-President being asked to take a job as a small town Mayor-BENEATH HIM. My young niece and nephew DID NOT enjoy it either. They called it \\"weird\\" and \\"boring\\". Not for adults or children and certainly not for people only wanting to see Dudley Moore. They will be disappointed, as I was.  R.I.P. Dudley Moore and Thanks for the laughs[in other movies]!
0316067598|4.0|This is truly impressive account of bravery under fire, endurance and heroism, in the vein of tales like Bravo Two-Zero and We Die Alone.  However, the tone and the caliber of the writing were off-putting.  Luttrell often comes across as flat-out arrogant, not just cocky like one would expect from any elite warrior.  Despite claiming to be apolitical early in the book, there were seemingly endless jabs at \\"liberals\\" and the national media, many related to his justifiable frustration with the rules of engagement.  His finger-pointing is difficult to reconcile with the reality of the civilian, executive branch chain of command under which he has served, which was clearly conservative.    Having said that, I found this book hard to put down.  The intensity of the underlying story is truly gripping.      Based on my own military background, I can't resist pointing out that this book is another fine contribution to the growing body of literature in which Army Rangers have come to the rescue of Navy Seals in Afghanistan (Not a Good Day to Die, Roberts Ridge, etc).  Seriously though, hats off to Luttrell and his comrades...
B00009L1TA|1.0|Roger Ebert wrote an interesting review of this movie, calling it a \\"Jerk-around-movie\\". It's full of twists and turns but in the end, it doesn't make any sense. perhaps if one would watch it over and over again, one could find the logic in it, but \\"Basic\\" isn't worth re-watching. In fact, it's not even worth watching even once. The script is dreadful, trying desperate to be clever, but succeeding only to bore the viewer. Samuel L. Jackson's and Giovanni Ribisi's performances feel like parodies of their performances in better movies.     \\"Basic\\" may just be one of the worst big budget movies to come out of Hollyood in recent years and there is no need to waste time or money to see it.
0385720920|5.0|This is one of Palahnuik's finest and in my opinion best since Fight Club. I would deffinately reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of great satire.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|If you like good SiFi, and don't have a copy of Serenity, you may as well get this one.   If you already have a copy, unless you can't get enough, this version doesn't offer much new.  Plus it's in cinema wide screen, so if you have a 4 X 3 aspect ratio TV, the picture is narrow.      The \\"Collector's Addition\\" offers a second movie commentary, new promo-piece, an expanded production-piece (high on the \\"love fest\\" index) and a piece that shows River's deterioration at the \\"academy.\\"  The second commentary is the major difference between the Standard and Collector's Addition.  It's very much dominated by Joss Whedon (writer & producer) and Nathan Fallion (Mal) (no surprise there) and is an utterly missed opportunity to explore characters and provide back story.  But in fairness to Nathan Fallion, he does ask others to comment.      Ron Glass's (Book's) question about his character's background is not answered by Whedon.   Here's my take - Book was an officer (probably upper level) in an elite anti-crime or CIA like unit, something happened he didn't like, so he left to become a preacher; this was hypothesized from the TV series, which was the basis for the movie.  At one point Whedon describes Simon's devotion to his sister (River) as a fantasy, that this level of devotion couldn't exist.  Well I hope Josh gets to know more of Life; it does exist; and it's not even that uncommon among some groups.       Also, if you were hoping to get to know Summer Glau (River) better, except for some stuff in the expanded production section, you may be disappointed.  She says very little throughout the 2 hour commentary.  Nevertheless, Serenity's premise makes for excellent SiFi, and it is a  fun movie.  The question that can't help but surface is, if Joss had such tremendous success with the series DVD sales, why did he abandon plot depth for flash?  The series really sold on substance, not flash.     Again, Serenity is good SiFi and a fun ride.  If you can't get enough, then theCollector's Addition is a good idea; on the other hand, if you're not a die-hard fan with a \\"regular\\" TV,  I'd recommend getting the standard full-screen version.  The Collector's Addition is worth every penny of the $18; and, overall, I was glad to contribute to the effort.
038533348X|3.0|Cats Cradle was a book I had to read over my summer break for my high school honors english class, and orgionaly, I was really reluctant to read it. But, after the first 100 pages, it started to grab my attention.      Cat' Cradle is a story of a man that wishes to write a book about the father of the Atom bomb(it's a fictonal person) and ends up finding out about some of his 'other' inventions(not some mutant freak). Like I said origonaly, the first half or so of the book loses me. I only got interested in it when the protagonist got on the plane midway through the book.     In some ways, people could find this novel contrivesal, because the main religon(Bokonon) mimics the eairly Christians death by the cross, and that man is going to far with science that is harful to us, but only if your trying to see that like I was. It's a fine book all in all, but it's somewhat boring at first, and his humor isent really that great, in fact, I only saw it once or twice. But then agian, I'm just a high school sophmore trying to disect it to find 'the inner meaning' so, in another 10 years I'll probably enjoy reading it.
0307277887|5.0|Dexter is a serial killer.  Dexter is the hero of the story.  You will like Dexter, and you will wonder why.  There is the brilliance of Jeff Lindsay.  In reading this book, you find yourself siding with the protagonist, only to have to catch yourself and remember that he is just as bad as the people he is killing, but for the code that his stepfather taught him to live by.  Dexter is a truly empathetic character who has no empathy.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but don't waste your time reading what I have written.  The time would be better spent reading this book!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|been watching Dexter this past week and it is a very Compelling show about a Vigilante Cop who takes care of the Bad guys in his own way. the show reminds of Nip tuck with the way he handles his business and then also elements of the Incredible Hulk with the split personalitys and a few other shows. but having said that there is a freshness about this show that you just don't see anywhere else. very compelling and interesting show. the main character has a emptyness that you end up feeling for and yet the double life is amazing. His Sister is incredible on her job as well. Blood lab work and sighting characteristics in other human beings and solving crimes. a must watch show.
B00004YA66|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters, and I remember literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I promised myself I'd buy it the minute it because available.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2007, and I finally got around to buying it in July. It's as good as I remembered! From the vivid imagery to the soul-stirring music, this film pulls you in from the start.<br /><br />I know it's one I'll be watching again!
6304712936|4.0|What it is:   1.  Fascinating story of talent, \\"you think that all men are created equal?\\", classical music, history, interesting character actors (especially M Abraham), my exwife effectively introduced our children to an appreciation of classical music through this film.   What it does not do:   Somehow, the mixture of Americana with European story and themes just does not seem to work for me in a credible way.  There are elements over the top.  It is difficult for me to really understand either of the two historical characters through this film, but perhaps that is what Hollywood sacrifies for the sake of a film with mass appeal?   That being said, definately worth seeing.
B00005JPQR|3.0|I'll be perfectly honest; I don't think this franchise needed a third act.  I feel like Supremacy had already left the character in an intruiging position.  He had redeemed himself in the eyes of his former handlers, righted some wrongs, avenged his lost loved one, and despite STRONG adversity, demonstrated once and for all that he was a better person than his adversaries.  Besides that, he now knew his real name and by all appearances, was now free to finally, patiently take a look at his past and maybe visit his old high school or something.  So if, for some irrational reason, the producers felt compelled to make another sequel, atleast the character no longer needed to be portrayed as one man against the evil CIA/Military Industrial Complex.  He could go in another, less violent, equally interesting direction.  So when I heard they were going to make the inevitable threequel, that's the direction I assumed the filmmakers were going to go in.  But instead, what we got is another hour and a half of Jason Bourne very skillfully kicking the crap out've nearly everybody with US government security clearance, this time, so he can reveal to the world how evil the framers of Treadstone really are.  Meh.  The thing is, it was mostly all done before.      On the plus side, the action is extremely well choreographed, the stunts are frigging amazing, and plot holes aside, this film avoids the vast majority of pitfalls that make most second sequels completely suck.  The movie also looks very good and the color scheme is more akin to the first Bourne movie than the second one, which used more grimy colors.  So in that sense, the film was more enjoyable for this reviewer.  And Matt Damon and the rest of the cast give consistent, generally engaging performances.      But the thing is, that's about all there is going for it.  Ultimately, the movie just leaves the character where he appeared to be at the end of the last one.  And while it resembles Identity a little more than itsdirect predecessor, it lacks the innocent, hip charm that Doug Liman seemed to infuse into the first film.  Much like the original's score, the story for that film was less consistent and while everyone else on Earth seems to consider that a shortcoming, this reviewer disagrees by arguing that that reflected the pacing of real life more authentically, making it feel much more accessible to an average nobody who can still appreciate how intimidating the big bad world can be.  Paralleling this, Jason Bourne is no longer the bewildered-looking guy who could pass as your innocent college professor.  He's, as one reviewer deftly put it, \\"an SAS-ninja-jedi,\\" who we know probably won't die.  Or will he...? :-)    So in summary, see this movie if you like good acting and enjoy above-averagedly intelligent entries in the spy genre.  But you may be a little dissapointed if you're expecting a revelation about the Bourne character.
0385493622|5.0|Once upon a time, two roads diverged into a yellow wood and I elected to pursue the path of an English and literature major.  Along the neglected wayside lay a path toward mathematics, a discipline in which I was more academically proficient (not that I was bad at the other) but the purpose and pleasure of which had somehow escaped me.  Though math had always been relatively easy for me, I believed -- perhaps through the way it had been taught and presented -- that it had never been \\"fun.\\"  Somehow its beauty had lain hidden beneath the drudgery of pedagogy.  It was only years later that I discovered G. H. Hardy's \\"A Mathematician's Apology\\" and E. T. Bell's \\"Men of Mathematics\\" and learned to appreciate the joy of mathematics and its symmetry (ironically, the same appreciation that fires my love for Jane Austen).  Though I will never become a professional mathematician, it is through books like \\"Fermat's Enigma\\" that I can share in the mathematician's joy of discovery that is the holy grail of every intellectual pursuit.<br /><br />To ignore or to shy from this book because of a fear of math is to place unnecessary limits on your understanding of the world.  Simon Singh does a masterful job of making accessible the story of an impenetrable math problem and telling it through the history of the mathematics that surround it and through the personalities of the mathematicians who pitted themselves against it and who ultimately led to its solution.  There are no threatening equations here that are not solved for you -- only the challenge to get your mind around ideas that perhaps are new.<br /><br />There is tremendous human drama along the way -- from the struggles of Sophie Germaine, who disguised herself as a man to study under the great mathematician Carl Gauss, to Evariste Galois, the brilliant young mathematician who died at the age of twenty in a dual he felt powerless to avoid, to Yutaka Tanyama, the brilliant Japanese mathematician whose conjecture pointed theway to Andrew Wiles' ultimate solution but who tragically took his own life before he was to ever see the proof, to the elation and doubts of Wiles himself when his much-heralded proof was found eventually to contain a fatal error.  The story is not just a thumbnail history of the purest of sciences, but a story of human redemption as we see Wiles' struggles to correct his proof beneath the uncomfortable gaze of an anxious academic community.<br /><br />Give yourself a chance on this one.  I have read it time and again (and again) and have never failed to be moved by Wiles' ultimate triumph -- or in how articulately he uses metaphor to state his problem or the honesty with which he addresses his failures and shares his joy.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits has touched my life like no other artist.  I feel as though my life would not be complete had I not discovered is absolutely captivating and encapsulating/enveloping music.    I am so impressed and awed with this mans talent that I am completely blown away each and every time I listen to his music.  Each time is better than the last and it hauntingly attaches itself to ones soul and spirit.  It is if I can feel the pain of his life and the beauty of his creativity all at the same time.  The highs and the lows.      I discovered Tom Waits by accident while residing in NYC attempting to be a struggling starving actor, and really doing great with the struggling and starving part of my goal.  Tom Waits made me understand that art is not about achieving financial success or even achieving understanding from others.  It is about complete pure honest expression and no one has been more true to their medium than Tom Waits.      I pray one day I get to shake this mans hand and tell him what a hero he is to me.  I wish more people would be like Tom Waits.  The world would be a much more pure better place.    Thank you Tom Waits for being such a powerhouse in the art world and such a beacon for all of humanity in the beyond.    -Keegan Reid

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Many were surprised that David Lynch would direct such a moving, simple (though not simplistic), and gentle story about a man driving across the country.  I am not surprised.  Lynch is one of our great filmmakers, and to see him branch out with this film (and succeed magnificently) is phenomenal.  In the hands of a lesser director, this film would have been awful.  It would have been overly sentimental with a bombastic music score.  With Lynch, it becomes incredibly moving and tender.  Richard Farnsworth should have won an Oscar for his performance here.  Why he didn't is another one of those Oscar mysteries that will never be solved.  Sissy Spacek, who Lynch has known since his Eraserhead days, gives a great performance as well.  The supporting cast is excellent here, too, and the small town folk are portrayed with dignity and humanity, a far cry from Lynch's Blue Velvet, where they were portrayed as pervertted and ugly.  But then, not all small town people can be deranged, now can they?  Lynch saw all sides of them, like the true artist that he is.  This is a wonderful film.  It came out in 1999, a fantastic year for films, and this was one of the best ones.  Thank you, David.

1594489505|5.0|I'm an avid reader of comtemporary fiction and loved The Kite Runner.  I expected to be disappointed by the second book, but it was fabulous!  An unusual story that draws you in and makes you aware of the lives of women in Afghanistan before and after the Taliban.  Be glad to live in the USA!

B0000025T6|5.0|As I write this, there are already well over 100 reviews about this classic Springsteen record, so what I will add comes from my heart and no where else. I was only 4 years old when this album initially came out, so let's say I didn't hear it then. Now a few decades later, being very familiar with the Boss' discography, Nebraska may be his most powerful and personal collection of tunes, (outside of The Rising which still blows me away.) There is something about his voice only accompanied by the guitar and harmonica that I find particularly compelling. When I first bought this disc a few years ago, I was out of work and feeling, as Bruce sings on the song Atlantic City, \\"tired of coming out on the losing end.\\" This album, like many of his records, gives a voice to working folk who fall on hard times, and never seem to get a break. I felt this album had been written just for me... now that's the sign of a really special songwriter.       Just like Springsteen's other records, this album tells some very troubling stories, from a Vietnam vet who loses his house and job and goes ballistic with a shotgun, to the state cop who faces the challenge of arresting his own dear brother...\\"nothing feels better than blood on blood.\\" But perhaps the best tracks on the album are the last two. There's \\"My Father's House\\", the haunting tale of a man drifting back to his traumatic childhood in body and soul. Depressing as this album is at certain moments, the last track, Reason to Believe, reminds us that now matter what life throws at us, people are incredibly resilient and manage to maintain a faith or hope in life itself no matter what happens to them. Speaking from experience, this is a life-changing album that anybody who thinks of themselves as a Springsteen disciple cannot live without.
1594489505|5.0|if you read and enjoyed the Kite Runner, buy this book today. If you haven't, buy both and read them both. History is intricately entwined with fiction to enchant the reader. The characters are so real that one believes you could travel to Afghanistan and meet them.
B000E41MS6|5.0|A few years ago if anyone told me that the next sci-fi series I'd latch on to after Stargate SG-1 was cancelled would be Dr. Who, I would have laughed and laughed.  That is until I saw this new, high budget and well written adaptation of the series.<br /><br />I'm traditionally into American \\"hard sci-fi\\" like Star Trek and Stargate franchises, and traditionally not into the British stuff, but this series made me cross the pond and pay attention to what's going on over there in Britian.  I'm very impressed with the actors, the writing, the stories, and the whole series in general.<br /><br />You get action, adventure, top-notch effects, character development, morality plays, and sarcastic pop-culture referential humor all in one.  And, speaking as an American, the English accents and expressions just make it all the more fun.<br /><br />This DVD set also contains a number of special features that both cater to the Dr. Who fan who wants more insight into the series and to the person new to the Dr. Who universe.  All in all a great deal of great sci-fi.  Bravo!!
B000VF0MJ8|5.0|I've always been surprised from the first time I heard it at the outrage MMM generates; I mean I understand the 70's fan expecting another Sally Can't Dance being let down.  But anyone who dug Lou Reed could see from the first it wasn't a Pop album & knew to expect miracles.<br />Which is what MMM was & is: That the original got released at all ~ WOW!  That anyone could TRANSCRIBE the music, as Zeitkratzer has done here.  That it could be so incredibly beautiful, original & unique still after all this time.  I'm blown away.  The present rendition tops anything in the entire Kronos Quartet output & makes the music they choose seem predictable & conventional, which if you add quite boring is how I find Kronos.<br />MM has always reminded me of Swastika Girls by Eno & Fripp, but as a much more purpose driven creation.  There's something inescapably elusive (I'm trying to convey an intangible) about this musical atmosphere.  Give it enough listens to grow on you.  This music is Avant Guard as can be;  including the most important aspect of experimentation to me: Successful results.  While I expected it, many will find this sound surprisingly listenable.<br />Hear it & be pleased with the results, I say. 5 STAR originality at it's Finest!  Bravo!<br />Zeitkratzer includes a DVD video of the performance of this music.  The DVD also features a discussion with Lou reed. who plays guitar on Part III of the present outing.  It all seems to come as quite a surprise (& a good one, for once) to Reed himself.
B00069YE0W|5.0|A great, strike that, a perfect album from the most famous guy no one knows the name of.  Being the guitarist of the worlds biggest current band you would think that John Frusciante's solo works would be more well known.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  Here is a man churning out better albums than his main band and yet remains well in the underground.  Those fortunate enough to hear Curtains knows how great an album Frusciante can make.  From the light feel good song \\"The Past Recedes\\" to the closing weeping \\"Leap You're Bar\\" there is no down fall on the album.  It is the most acoustic of all of John's albums and has an overall relaxed feel but when he wants to move you John can toy with emotions perfectly.  Standouts include \\"The Past Recedes\\", \\"Control\\", and \\"Time Tonight\\".

There were parts that were left out of course but all in all a very good movie,still the book was much better and left me wanting more.<br /><br />Too bad there cannot be a sequel since both characters are now deceased.<br /><br />The only part I did not like was the beginning where her children found the story of her love story. I hated the actions of the son or maybe it was the actor.

0375703861|5.0|\\"White Teeth\\" came highly recommended by a trusted reader and I've finally gotten around to reading it.  The story revolves around three families, three cultures, three religions (Chalfenism among them) and three histories.  Is it good things or bad things that come in threes?  Set in London yet rooted in Jamaica and Bangladesh, \\"White Teeth\\" is a convergence of class, history, and culture.  The Jones' are an interracial English/Jamaican couple brought together by their individual need to flee.  Archibal fleeing the chaos of a marriage seized by mental illness; Clara escaping the grip of the Jehovah Witness religion that threatens to permeate all aspects of her life.  The Iqbals' are an arranged marriage, brought together by cultural and religious history.  Samad conflicted by a history he fears will be erased by the present; Alsana, strong and willful, yet unable to absorb aspects of western culture that are foreign to her religious beliefs.  The Chalfens are an agnostic English couple brought together by the desire to further a tradition of intellectual and liberal empire.  Marcus, a scientist from a long line of intellectuals, is engaged in research that could alter the genetic makeup of humanity in ways that could eliminate the randomness of genetic mishaps and malfunctions (the very randomness that is seen by some as the will of God); Joyce a horticulturalist and essayist with an overbearing need to nurture and cultivate everything and everyone around her.<br /><br />Although the interactions of the parental units creatively and humorously explore the historical affects of colonization on the colonized and the colonizer, it is the lives of the next generation of Iqbals, Jones and Chalfens that allow the author to explore issues of cultural, religious and class differences between the western and eastern hemisphere.  Irie, the biracial daughter of the Jones', is burdened not only with the trials of adolescence within the pop culture of a modernized England but also with the history of colonized Jamaica and the salvation sought by her grandmother through the doctrine of the Jehovah Witness faith.  Millat and Magid, the Cain and Able offspring of the Iqbals' are challenged with questions of identify in the face of an Islamic tradition that seems at constant odds with the more liberal communities within which they live.  Joshua, the Chalfens' progeny is also trying to navigate the choppy waters of puberty as he realizes that the lineage he's inherited may be at stark contrast to the person he's becoming.<br /><br />\\"White Teeth\\" is a spectacular debut novel.  Smith has unleashed a level of creativity typically found in seasoned writers.  She has created memorable, lively characters each with a unique voice that highlights the diversity of London while simultaneously calling attention to the commonality of experience inherent in the legacy of oppression.  I particularly enjoyed the cleaver way in which Smith uses teeth as a metaphor throughout the novel.  For certainly history is deeply rooted in who we are as individuals, a people, a nation.  While there are times when we must extract ourselves from our history to forge a path that allows us to live up to our full potential,  our history will always be the pulp at the center of who we are and invariably impacts our future.  This is great text for group discussion.  Highly Recommended!the history of colonized Jamaica and the salvation sought by her grandmother through the doctrine of the Jehovah Witness faith.

B000H7JCG4|5.0|All I have to say is that Beverly Hills, 90210 - The Complete First Season was the first t.v. drama I fell so head over heels in love with as a little girl. Maybe this show was a little to wild for me but by today's standards, this little gem seems pretty tame now. I love Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth, they play such close friends on the show, that it was such a surrpise to me that they hated each other in real life. Rest in peace Aaron Spelling, and thanks to Darren Starr for creating one of the most important and spellbinding shows of the '90s. Anyone who was ever a fan of this show, should get season one as soon as possible. So sit back and take a trip down memory lane with Brandon, Brenda, Kelly, Steve, Andrea, Dylan, Donna, and David, and that weirdo that accidentally shot himself in season two. Enjoy!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|[***SPOILER WARNING***]    This film is not only brilliant, and probably Lynch's best, but it is completely comprehensible. One key bit of insight brings meaning to the entire film. I'm not going to dissect this film in detail, but I'll give you enough of a clue to get you started.    Nikki's neighbor (the old woman who lives \\"just down the way\\", played by Grace Zabriskie) is the real main character in this story. Nikki, and most of the other characters in this film, are manifestations of the old woman's multiple personality disorder. The old woman worked as a prostitute in Poland when she was young (and married). She became pregnant by another man (her husband could not father children), but lost the baby. These and other traumas in her life shattered her psyche.    The film is mostly about the woman's struggle to re-integrate her multiple personalities with the help of her therapist, which she accomplishes in the end. I'll let you work out the rest of the story for yourself. It's well worth the effort!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Grindhouse is without a doubt one of the best, most crazy enjoyable movies of this year and several previous years and a few before that.  And I can't wait to get it on DVD.  But apparently I'll have to.    The people who release DVDs -- not just this travesty but every last one of them -- have finally crossed the line here.  I've been scr%w%d over repeatedly by a film coming out and then three months later coming out again and six more versions the following year and then the definitive version and then the next definitive version and on and on and on ...    And no more.    I'm not calling for a boycott of this pathetic release.  I'm calling for a boycott of the whole flippin industry.  Don't buy DVDs when they come out.  Don't do it.  Force these people to stop r@ping their customers.  They only understand cash money.  Take it away from them.    When Grindhouse is finally actually released on DVD -- and it will be, after the studio has soaked whatever suckers they can with this half-film nonsense -- I still won't buy it.    Know why?    Because six months later there will be another version with the complete movie plus these b@st@rdized versions plus the extras.    And even then I still won't buy it.    Know why?    Because after that, there will be yet another release with special packaging (maybe a Cherry Darling action figure), and perhaps a documentary on the DVD release controversy.    It never ends.  Save your money.
B000002WPI|5.0|The Wu-Tang Clan bulldozed its way onto the music scene in 1993 with their debut smash Enter the Wu Tang: 36 Chambers. The album is simply outstanding due to excellent writing, production and lyricism from their 9 highly skilled lyricists. They set the bar extremely high for posse cuts with \\"Protect Ya Neck,\\" one of the best hip hop songs of all time. Incredible job by the Wu-Tang.
0385733577|4.0|On the whole, I liked this book; not as much as I hoped to, but enough.  It sure didn't waste much time getting going, and once it did it was clever and inventive.    There were a few minor things that just irked me though.  For example, I know it will seem nit-picky, but it bothered me that the main character, Nicholas Flamel, was constantly referred to by his full name, such as:  \\"The wind blew hard at Nicholas Flamel as he stood there.\\"  All of the other characters are usually referred to by just their first name, but for some reason Flamel isn't.    The other thing that bothered me was the repeated use of odd phrases, like \\"he licked dry lips,\\" and \\"his tongue was too big for his mouth.\\"    So I do recommend this book but not extremely highly.  I'm guessing the sequel will be better though.

B000001GX8|4.0|This Figaro is recommendable primarily for the contribution of the women in the cast. Gundula Janowitz is a beautiful, aristocratic Countess and Edith Mathis a very good Susanna indeed. The late Tatiana Troyanos is excellent as Cherubino and Patricia Johnson an unusually good Marcellina. Of the men, I'm less convinced. Hermann Prey's Figaro is engaging but misses the repressed anger of the character. Fisher-Dieskau's Count is boldly presented, but substitutes snarling for singing in too many instances. The rest of the men are OK, but they are outclassed by other recorded exponents.     My major problem with this set is that many of the cast members just don't sing the Italian language very well (the Germanic 'dunkveh' for 'dunque' for example). The conversational quality that should inform the recitatives isn't present. In this most quicksilver of Mozart's operas, that's a signicant flaw. For what it's worth, the recording is complete with Marcellina's and Basilio's fourth act arias.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Johnny Depp, need I say more? Okay for those of you who arn't a fan of his, there is more, more indeed.       This movie is a recipe with all the right amounts. Suspense, romance, humor, depth, characters with layers.      This movie isn't simply about one of the most loved desserts of all time but what it represents. This movie is about prejudice, desire, temptation, religion, secrets, determination, and what happens when you are under the microscope.     Things are not what they always appear, are they? Well you'll have to watch to find out.      I found this movie very sensual. Johnny Depp I could devour him, he's so delicious and the chemistry with Juliet Binoche is on key. All of the elements add up to a treat sure to please, again and again.     a side note... I found the music enjoyable
0061122416|5.0|I found this life changing book most fortuitously at just the right time. It validated some of the experiences I had, about which I had wavering faith.  I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and my life is permeated with doubt.    For me, the bottom line is that every moment I have the choice to pay attention to God's messages, that speak to my heart, and stay present. To the extent that I make that choice, grounded in faith, I can live my life in the present, available to myself and to others.
B00008OE4W|5.0|If you have not seen Sneakers, where have you been hiding?    Robert Redford leads this all star cast, an emsemble that blends effortlessly for so much talent in one room.    Sneakers combines good character with interesting plot, suspense, humor, and romance.     I never get tired of watching this movie again and again, it's just a great movie!
B000NA77YO|5.0|What a cool name, DIO. It actually means God in italian. Dio also invented the devil horn hand sign that most hard rock and metal fans use.    Well this CD is awesome. It is filled with doom and gloom metal by none other than BLACK SABBATH.  That is right, but no more Ozzy. This is Dio screaching dramatically over demolishing and ear splitting metal riffs.      Dio era Black Sabbath features out of this world lyrics about the end of the world, voodoo, magical children of the sea, the devil, mystical crosses, shadows, and gothic themes that would elicit any true METAL fan's interest.    This is highly recommended and please expect CLASSIC METAL. Do NOT expect the likes of System of a Down or Hatebreed. This is true classic metal at its baddest.

B00077F948|5.0|This is a masterpiece of a recording by one of the greatest guitarists in the world of the work of Barrios, an unappreciated composer. I recommend this highly for anyone that loves the classical guitar, student or professional. Williams brings great sensitivity to the nuances of these compositions and tremendous skill to these emotionally complex pieces. My only concern is that this is also packaged as \\"From the jungles of Paraguay\\"   giving the impression that this are two different recording when they are exactly the same. I believe this CD is the original package.
B000089QEN|4.0|The story is well done. The music is excruciating: either public dirge, or bad beerhall. Perhaps the makers thought the music for the series should have a martial theme: lots of brass, especially tuba, none muted. Be prepared to mute the horns yourself during many scenes without dialogue. Painful.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I have to use the old saying but the best word to describes this movie is Amazing (with a capital \\"A\\" get it). Superman II is just an overall amazing movie and still hasn't aged after all of these years. The script is so well written, that it is hard to describe in words. It is just a fan boys dream come true and a movie that fans can watch over and over and never get tired of seeing it.<br /><br />There is just so much emotion that is put into this film, especially between Jor-El and Kal-El. The acting and choice of cast is once again perfect, and Gene Hackman still hasn't lost his touch as Lex (Not so bald in the early films) Luthor. This movie also has the second coolest villain in all super hero movies, Zod. There just so many catchy quotes that come from and are about him. Superman II is a must have movie, you will love it and what Richard Donner has added makes it all the sweeter
B000P2A24W|5.0|It is weird.  Most of the time when you hear a good song you pick up the album and, if you are lucky, find one other song you like.  If you are lucky.  However, Bon Jovi has always been a good gamble to find a couple of songs that I like.    So imagine my surprise when I've been listening to this album the last few hours and there are no songs that I want to skip over.  Of course, I've given some extra attention to the hit on this album \\"Let's Make a Memory,\\" but I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of all the other songs as well.    Another odd thing is that I'm not a big fan of country and I like this album despite the obvious country influence in most of the songs.    Being a kid in the 80's I still think I like his previous works a little bit better, but a lot of that old rock band made its influence felt in this album and it was like audibly visiting an old friend.    However, whether a kid of the 80's, 90's, or this millennium I think you'll find that you like this album and would highly recommend picking up the entire album as opposed to picking up just the single of the hit songs.  You won't regret it.
B000J10EQU|5.0|At first, I didn't care for the film at all. Now that I own the DVD and have seen it again, I don't know what I was thinking before because I ended up loving it! The entire film isn't slow, but the problem is that the first thirty minutes are. After it hits the thirty minute mark, it really picks up with a really interesting story and great special effects.<br /><br />It really is amazing where technology has brought us in the special effects department. They are truly breath-taking in the film, but some of the most beautiful scenes are the ones that you miss if you don't really pay attention. Such as the scene towards the end of the film when Superman falls to Earth unconscious. Not to give anything away, but just how it looks like a small dot but you realize that it isn't is just great. Overall, the movie is great and I feel bad that I didn't like it my first time seeing it. This does deserve your viewing for a second time if you have only seen it once. I am one of the converted and am actually looking forward to the next movie in the series
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I've got a HD DVD player but there has only been one album that I've bought for my collection (Batman Begins).  Everything else has been rental through Netflix and the local Blockbuster.    Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series has become the second HD DVD to be added.  And despite its $100 retail price, it is worth every single penny.    I did originally rent this from Netflix and had read all the reviews on this product and was anxious for it to arrive.  Unfortunately I ran into two problems.    The first was that there is a patch that is required in order to make this run on my HD DVD player that is attached to my XBox 360.  There were some user comments on this web site on how to patch the XBox 360 if you don't have XBox Live so if you are having the same problem, check out the comments.  The patch fixed things right away.  (Thanks, Amazon!).    The second problem was that my family wasn't interested in watching it with me.  \\"We don't want to watch some nature program,\\" they said.  Well, I basically forced them to watch it with me anyways.  After the first episode was finished my family was in love with it as much as me.  In fact, my son said, \\"We should watch an episode every night until we finish it.  Maybe even two episodes.\\"    Not only have we enjoyed watching this movie almost every night but we have shown it to several of our neighbors and watched a few episodes with many of the kids in our neighborhood.  I've yet to run into somebody who loves this series.    There are so many good things about this album I'm not sure where to begin.  Probably just how beautiful it this video is, especially since everything is in crystal clear high definition.  After all, the planet earth is not too exciting in regular television so in high definition it makes you feel like you are there.  High definition is also very bright and colorful which makes everybody sit there oo-ing and awe-ing the entire time.    Also, it is very interesting and fascinating.  This isn't yourstandard nature show, you actually get to see things that you've never heard of or seen before.  Monkey's who swim for food, bears who live high in the mountaintops searching under rocks for moths to eat, and a bird who actually cleans up his area and does the wildest and funny dance for his potential mates (that was our favorite part).    This covers everything from pole to pole, to the highest mountains to the lowest valleys and caves in the earth.  You'll laugh, you'll probably even cry when you see some animals fall victim to their predators, you'll be amazed as what is out there on our planet, and you'll want to watch each episode over and over again.    Most of my reviews end with who would like a certain product and possibly who wouldn't like the product.  This is a rare one... I recommend this to EVERYBODY and can't think of anybody who would not find this a fun and wonderful video.  David Attenborough is a wonderful guide as you experience planet earth in a way you never have before.
B000ILYYJE|3.0|The Doors happens to be one of my favorite musical groups of all time. Their music is endless. No one before or since has ever sounded quite like them. I however wanted to wait before I purchased all 6 of their studio lp's on cd. I had all of them on vinyl lp's for years, and had the 2 cd greatest hits package. But all of their studio lp's are musts to own on cd. I originally heard that the sound quality was not top par on the cd's until they were reissued only a few years ago. Still, something told me to wait. When I heard that all of the lp's were going to be completely restored and in 5.1 Dolby Digital AND DTS audio, I said to myself it was time to take the plunge and get this set. I do have pros and cons about this set and I will address them one at a time.<br />1. I am a huge fan of music in surround sound, this is one of the main reasons that I purchased this set. As far as the surround sound goes, I could'nt be more pleased. All 6 lp's sound simply fantastic. With the exception of the 1st lp which doesn't really use the surrounds except for some ambiance and echo effects. From Strange Days to L A Woman you feel like you're right in the studio with the group as they play. One note, these songs are played in Advance Stereo and Advance Surround sound and may not play on all standard dvd players. A++ on the surround.<br />2. The 6 lps as mentioned before have been fully restored to their intended brilliance. The debut lp has been slightly speeded up. For the past 40 years (according to their producer Bruce Botnick) the debut lp on vinyl and cd form which have been in circulation were issued at a slightly slower speed. Due to a technical glich or something. Why this wasn't corrected in all that time is a mystery. I happened to be used to the slower version because I have been listening to it for many years. So when I first heard the speeded up (slightly) new version I was a little surprised. I don't really mind it and I suppose I will get used to it after a few more listenings. You now also get the uncensored version. When Jim Morrison sang \\"She Get High\\" on \\"Break On Through\\" Elektra records took out the word \\"High\\" due to drug references. It has now been reinserted. Also for the last song on the album called \\"The End\\" Morrison used the F word quite a few times, and that was also edited out. It has now also been put back in. On the other 5 lp's you will hear extra notes, dialog before and after tunes, and many other surprises. An A for nicely restoring the lps.<br />3.You also get over 20 unreleased bonus songs, alternate takes, some unreleased tunes like the \\"Work In Progress\\" version of the Lizard King song that was supposed to be on the \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" lp, and one or 2 brand new Doors songs. Not bad. B+<br />4. You also get video clips. Unfortunately, they are very poor quality, and most if not all of them are available on other Doors dvds. It would have been nice to include brand new never available before clips, (and for the price of this set 20-30 of them). C on the videos. A real shame.<br />5.The cd's are all cased in a huge door like box with a small peephole in which you can look in and see some b+w photos of the group. When you open up the box you see a hugh amount of wasted empty space. This is a real waste of paper or cardboard if you prefer. Fortunately, all 6 lp's album covers have been fully reproduced to their original brilliance, and each jacket includes a small booklet containing new notes by producer Botnick, all lyrics to all the songs, and some nice unreleased color and b+w photos. C on the packaging.<br />6.This relates to the price of this set and I believe it's very important. Now, if you are a huge Doors fan and it does not bother you to have these lp's in surround sound, then this set is not necessary. Although this set includes the lp's in Stereo as well as surround, it's just not worth the high price tag for this set. All of the 6 lps may be purchased separately at a much lower price. If you break it down, the set includes both stereo and surround versions of the same lp. Each of the 6 lp's included in this set have 2 discs each. A cd and dvd. If you figure one cd cost's $8 or $9 and multiply times 2 that's about $20. Multiply that times 6 lp's and that's $120. Add that to the 30 or so extra bonus audio and video selections, and you've got the roughly $140-$150 price tag that goes for this set. B- on the price.<br />So that's my take on this set. I shelled out quite a bit of money for these lp's, and I won't be too happy when my credit card bill arrives, but I wanted to get the best quality of the Doors music and that's what really matters to me. I watched the videos once and I'll probubly never watch them again. The bonus songs are interesting, and I will definitely listen to them again (for the record, they are also in surround sound). In the long run I wish they could have been sold individually, but that's water under the bridge now. And if you really couldn't care less about the music in surround sound, then skip this set completely. I still recommend this set. Overall B.set includes both stereo and surround versions of the same lp. Each of the 6 lp's included in this set have 2 discs each. A cd and dvd.

B000NQR7NO|4.0|What a scorching followup album from the lads. There is alot to like on this album.
B000002VE7|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Stereotomy, released in 1985, marked a further and better inclinnation into echoing rock with a brand new synthesized style, combined with the best natured modern arrengements. Released after the pop-like, mellow Vulture Culture, Stereotomy kept a strong synth rock based structure, although it was the album which breaked their \\"trillogy of best sold albums\\" mainly because of the more difficult sound and because of Woolfson small vocal contribution, as Woolfson voice was very commercial.<br /><br />Stereotomy is mainly a futuristic, synth rock album, being mainly structured with modern synthesized mellodies and a rock basis, its styles differ from synth rock, prog and power ballads. Its thoughtful, personal and critisizing lyrics assume one of their most strong and questioned compositions, just as another reviewer mentioned, if you listen carefuly to the album and compare it with the band's later destine, it really sounds like deja-vu writings, almost with a subliminal message of the band's fate. Stereotomy possesses catchy, electronic, powerful, aggressive, urban, modern and futuristic moods. Even though it stays as a much more aggressive album, its awkward use of modern keyboards, the much lesser impact of the album, the poor sales, its lack of evocative material and its uninspired cohersion makes Stereotomy the worst of TAPP albums, but still is a nice work.<br /><br />Some of the songs make it a memorable album, still the cohersion in the whole album stays awkward, but still there is a group of songs that keep Stereotomy a fine work: the title track Stereotomy gives to the album a great potential and hope, its echoing performance, plus its imaginative and serious lyrics are fantastic; although the song is sang by John Miles, it possesses Eric Woolfson only vocal feature. Then comes the famous, beautiful, sentimental and recognizable power ballad Limelight, sang by Procol Harum's Gary Brooker, it has a sincere touch of the dream and comfort of every artist in rising fame, its the second best song in the album, while the electric, futuristic and catchy instrumental Where's The Walrus? is a valueable and memorable song. Then comes Light Of The World, while not having a powerful style or too much of fantastic mellodies, its the only song where Parsons bring back his classic style, being an emotionally powerful and light, uncompromising, unexagerated arrengements and mellodies, it remains as a mixture between I Robot's Breakdown and The Turn Of A Friendly Card's Nothing Left To Loose, certainly being the most recommendable song in the album. The other tracks are also good but not as impressive as the others, like the light, funny and catchy Beaujolais, the interpretations of both the smooth and stressful side of the city in Urbania, the rocker In The Real World, the slight ambient effort of Chinese Whispers, which connects with the fierce but unnecessary Stereotomy Two. Track Pick: Stereotomy, Limelight, Where's The Walrus?, Light Of The World.<br /><br />The artists performance is also great but Alan Parsons' keyboard usage at one point gets stressful, while Eric Woolfson only sang one fragment of a song, and this kind of dissapoints me because he is one of my favourite vocalists. Andrew Powell's orchestral arrengement is the most poor of all of his arrengements, I only noticed a slight string performance at some point of Where's The Walrus?. The vocalists in the album include Chris Rainbow, Gary Brooker, John Miles and Graham Dye.<br /><br />In conclussion I regard Stereotomy as their worst album, although its still well crafted and with a serious/somber composition, it finds its way to appreciation though, just like they say, as music isn't written in words, sometimes the message can't be correctly comprehended.ising fame, its the second best song in the album, while the electric, futuristic and catchy instrumental Where's The Walrus? is a valueable and memorable song.

I doesn't just tell you that you should do something to better your life, but it tells you how to do it as well. Excellent Read!!! I recommend this book to anyone who wants a change in their life for the better.

B000QXDED6|4.0|This film recreates the events that led up to the battle at Thermopylae, the battle itself, and its aftermath. It tells the story of how King Leonidas of Sparta  with 300 of Sparta's best trained warriors fought a battle to the death, fending of a horde of thousands of soldiers lead by the Persian King Xerxes, who was intent on conquering all the Greeks, literally heading them off at the pass at Thermopylae. Greece, at the time of the battle, was not a single entity but, rather, a compilation of city states. Spartans were known for their highly developed physical attributes and their well trained phalanx of fighting men. The Athenians, on the other hand, tended to be the scholars and philosophers.<br /><br />The general story is well told, and the cast is superlative, giving excellent performances. Special kudos go to Gerald Butler for his portrayal of King Leonidas, a man for whom duty and honor is everything. Also noteworthy is the beautifully nuanced performance of Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, wife to King Leonidas. In her hands,  the queen comes alive as a vibrant, intelligent, helpmate to the king, unafraid of voicing her opinion and capable of doing what is necessary to ensure that the King is well-served. Lest anyone think that contemporary norms are what drive her portrayal, one need know that Spartan woman held a position of respect in their culture.<br /><br />What I found distracting about the film were the special effects, as it had a somewhat jarring effect. At times, I felt as if I were watching one of my son's video games, as that is what it resembled, especially during the battle scenes. It was somewhat cartoonish and, I felt, diminished the film. Of course, the film is based upon the graphic novel, \\"300\\", by Frank Miller, which is pretty much a hardcover comic book, and it appears that the director of the film stayed to true to the source of his inspiration.<br /><br />The battle at Thermopylae, however, is one of history's great stories, and it is a shame that it had to be reduced to something simulating an arcade experience. I venture to say, however, that that is one of the attributes of the film that others may really enjoy. It is simply a matter of different strokes for different folks, and viewers will probably divide on this issue along generational lines. No matter which side of the divide in which one may find oneself, one will, undoubtedly, enjoy this well-acted film.

006441034X|4.0|This YA fantasy novel moves at a breakneck speed, and some of the action scenes would be better suited to a faithful movie adaptation than the printed word.  It was too hyper for my tastes, with too many important side characters, but I was eager to see what happened.  It is very different from the movie of the same name, [[ASIN:B000CDGVOE Howl's Moving Castle]], which shares only the title, the moving castle setting, and some character names; the tone, plot, and most of the characters in the movie are vastly different from those of the book.  I found the book better suited to the younger audience; the dark political message of the movie was unsettling even to me as an adult.  But if you like this book, be sure to check out Terry Pratchett's [[ASIN:0060012382 The Wee Free Men]] for a similarly spunky young heroine.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Bon Jovi proves yet again an incredible talent for writing and musical composition for which there is no comparison. \\"Lost Highway\\" is arguably the best Bon Jovi album ever. It is incredibly rich with the high energy tunes like \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"We Got It Going On\\" or the softer ballads like \\"Make A Memory\\",  \\"We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" and \\"Seat Next To You\\". Every offering recorded offers something different and unique. Songs you'll likely hear on the radio in addition to 'Memory' are \\"Whole Lot Of Leaving\\", \\"The Last Night\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"I Love This Town\\".  Lost Highway will not disappoint. The album delivers the goods in a big way!

0307277887|3.0|I watched the first 12 episodes of the Showtime series before reading this book.  Although the book is a worthwhile read, the television writers were able to greatly improve on the manuscript.  The characters and story line seems to have a lack of depth compared to the tv series.  While it is a fantastic premise, the story falls short of being a meaty read.

B00005JPQR|5.0|Jason Bourne is here for a third time and the cinematic trilogy is in the books. Comparing The Bourne Ultimatum to the previous two films, this third installment is just as good as the first, and slightly better than the second. Letting this third film stand alone, it is a fantastic action thriller. With all the third installments of movie trilogies of late (Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-Man, Oceans, Shrek), The Bourne Ultimatum ranks among the best, if not the best.<br /><br />Jason Bourne continues to chase after his identity while being chased and hunted down by the people who implemented him in a secretive operation. The story is suspenseful, intense, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. While the door is somewhat left open for a continuance, the Ultimatum trilogy ends with closure and satisfaction.

B000P0J024|5.0|This collaboration of guys with nothing left to prove musically is pure genius on the part of Harrison and company. The first CD, with hits like \\"Handle Me with Care\\" and \\"The End of the Line\\" is more catchy and commercial; yet the second CD holds a few gems as well. The untimely loss of Roy Orbison obviously had a major impact on the second CD.   With fun songs like \\"Rattled\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Dirty World,\\" the first CD has completely memorable music. Tom Petty's \\"Last Night\\" is a rock and roll song with country lyrics, warning of the perils of picking up a girl at a bar.   This three-part set is definitely a bargain and a must-have for Harrison, Orbison, Petty and Lynne fans.

Khaled Hosseini paints a very vivid picture of life in Afghanistan for women, before, during and after the Taliban regime. It is heartbreaking to read, but well worth it. My husband is currently serving his 2nd tour in Afghanistan and this book made me feel even more proud of him and the other soldiers over there. I recommend this book for anyone, but if you are a military spouse, it is a must. Everyone I know that has read this book loved it and couldn't put it down.
B000063UR1|5.0|Silent Running is one of those quirky films (The Wicker Man, Cul de Sac, Johnny Guitar, Oh Lucky Man for example) that once seen are never quite forgotton. Whatever flaws they may have in script or performance that stops them being true masterpieces of cinema thay nevertheless are like nothing else in the canon. Seeing Silent Running again for the first time in ages I was definitely not disappointed by it. The effects stand up well for 1971 (there's definitely an echo of SR in Gerry Anderson's Space 1999, and to my eye the model work seems to anticipate George Lucas too). The Valley Forge has a real feeling of vastness and industrial grit; even now a rarity in SF sets where the use of low lighting and general gloom is a way around tight budgets (see Danny Boyle's recent Sunshine, a film which I think quite consciously references SR). I'm afraid I'd forgotton just what an intense performance Bruce Dern gives. I like it but he's a strange presence on screen. Is it unfair to say that at no time and in no country could Bruce Dern have become a major star other than the United States in the early 1970s. Athletic and rangy like a period tennis ace but also kinda goofy with a sort of whiny Woody Allen voice that seems to belong to a quite different sort of body. I know, I know I'm being terribly unfair to him and again I repeat I like his performance here (it's his movie, really) but he does add to the slight oddness of the whole. As does the presence of Joan Baez...but the score is fantastic and really makes a contribution to the mood; jangling and hippy dippy but also ecstatic and trippy (\\"in the sun\\"). It's a real product of The Age of Aquarius; that brief and vaguely optimistic moment that stretched sometime from around the first moon landings in '69 to the oil shock. Tiny, magical details: one of the drones touches the other with its foot to attract its attention when Lovell approaches when it appears to be having a doze, or the way they sneakily show their card handsto each other during the poker scene. Finally, above all, is its precience. Not all that many years after Silent Spring when it was made. Ecological Disaster...I wonder what happened to that?

B000002J03|5.0|I ask for this as a birthday present and didn't quite know what to expect, but I was pleasently surprised. I cut off all the lights and hit play ready for what was about to come...      1. Whole Lotta Love- This is a zeppelin classic with an amazing solo and a very weird pause in the middle featuring feedback and radio whaves. 5/5     2. What Is And What Should Never Be- This is a slow down from the hard rockin ways of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", but it dosen't take you anywhere your not ready to go. It's a ballad but an odd one with a dark feel to it. 4.5/5    3. The Lemon Song- I'm gonna be straght up, they ripped Hendrix's style so much but they tried no to make it to obvious. It's a cool song but it runs kind of long, and it gets boring. 4/5    4. Thank You- Probably my least favorite song on the entire album, it a ballad, a very sappy ballad, that leads into a mediocere solo by Jimmy. Not the best song but it's not terrible. 3.5/5    5. Heartbreaker- Legendary riff, legendary solo, legendary song. This is a nice change of pace, the rock is back and it's gonna get ya! When I heard the music stop I thought the CD had skipped but then the guitar came in and the solo blew my mind!!! 5/5    6. Living Loving Maid(She's Just A Woman)- Short, sweet, and to the point is what this song is, if you haven't heard this then you don't listen to classic rock stations. It's a nice song with a fun riff. 5/5    7. Ramble On- Everybody comes down hard on this song, but it's not a bad song just no very rockin'. But I still like it. 4.5/5    8. Mody Dick- The riff on this song is out of control, Jimmy gets a couple of minutes to show off his skills and than it's just Bonzo. He starts out playing tripplets with his hands, then he uses the sticks again. Possibly the best drum solo ever, possibly. 5/5    9. Bring It On Home- It starts out with Robert singing in a weird muffled voice, it speed up and then the real song begins. It's really just a blues song, a pretty good way to end the album. 4.5/5    So that's my experience with Led Zeppelin 2, I hope this review help you, cheers!- Chuck

0765348276|5.0|I literally read this book in one (long evening).  I could barely put it down .  It's just a fantastic universe that Scalzi has dreamed up.  A very exciting military sci-fi adventure, in the same vein as Heinlein's Starship Troopers (and the underrated movie version).  Just excellent.  But you don't have to take my word for it!!
0451169514|3.0|It started out strong. I was hooked and expected another great book, and suddenly and rather quickly, it became really wordy and overly detailed with some rather useless action. It was drudgery to get through. Like someone reviewed before, I questioned if It was edited. The book could truly be brought down to an easy 700 pages, not the 1093 that is turned out to be.<br /><br />I love Stephen King, and he is at his best when he is concise, curt, and short (Carrie, Cujo, The Girl who loved Tom Gordon) but in It he took a potentionally great story and burdened it with his/a lengthy prose that was endless. And the misogynistic element of the story can not be overlooked. It rears its ugly and senseless head in the last hundred pages, where something happens that not only makes me cringe (because of its oddness in the story), but it didn't build the plot at all. It made no sense.<br /><br />\\"It\\" is scattered and lengthy. My regret is that I started it this summer and ended up forcing myself to finish it, when I could've just put it down.
B000009VOL|3.0|Ms. Marshall always seemed to get an undue amount of credit as an indie female songwriter, when in fact she is usually guilty of just highly embellishing numbingly simple songs. On rare occasions her attempts at a haunting minimalism by way of undereducated musician do work, and with this being one of her earliest discs we do have a few seamless tracks. Roughly half of the album however retains her signature trickery of which yields little more then boring songs dragged thru her lo-fi production in attempts at rawness.
0757302661|5.0|This book was very helpful to me tho I feel it could have been titled differently. What I found most useful in it was how it assured me my body was made for childbirth and I had to stick up for myself when I did not want to do things the doctors and nurses wanted me to do for no other reason than it made things convenient to THEM. If you have even thought of buying it, go through with the purchase it's worth every penny!
0316067598|5.0|I won't repeat the points of the many positive comments.  I agree with most.        Many comments about problems with our ROE in Afghanistan.  Read this book.  I won't spoil the story, but ROE are fundamental to the SEAL's mission gone bad.  That said, the author implies that they were constrained by ROE.  Actually, had they been carrying a few feet of rope or even a few simple zip-ties, these heroic SEALs might have bought themselves many hours of lead time to get off the mountain.  ROE alone didn't cause the mission to go bad.  Read the book and make your own decision.      In anycase, these SEALs are American heroes.  This is a good book.  No need to buy fiction when you can read stories like these.
B00005JPUL|1.0|Where do I begin with this preachy, dumb film? Should I focus on the terrible acting? How about the lame dialog?  What about the pointless pontification at every level?  Or about the ridiculous \\"tied up in a ribbon\\" ending that defies belief?  The Invasion is the worst thing I've seen in a \\"serious film\\" since the dreadful remake of The Wicker Man. In fact, it's worse.  I was tempted almost continuously to leave the theater and demand my money back, but it was almost 90 degrees and humid outside. Stay for the air conditioning if you must, but not for this cinematic tripe.

B0002KPHXS|5.0|This film packs a wallop of romance! Starring Leslie Howard (Gone With the Wind) and Ingrid Bergman(Casablanca).  Howard plays a sensitive violinist who falls in love with Ingrid Bergman- the only problem is that he is married and she is his daughter's music teacher. Despite these \\"complications,\\" there love of music and each other prevail. His wife never really undertsood him and despite her desperately wanting to bridge the gap between them, there is a part of him that he could never really share. He found his soul's refuge in Bergman's arms and leaves his wife and two small children to be with her. Bergman undertsood him completely because, in many ways, they were two sides of the same coin with same outlook on life, love, and music. They tour the country together and end up living in Europe as lovers.<br /><br />Dilemma arises when Bergman is offered a prestigous scholarship to further her musical study and Howard's divorce papers arrive from his wife. Are they willing to cast all else aside in order to be together? Is Howard ready to sever ties with his family and is Bergman going to give up the chance of a lifetime?<br /><br />The film is a romantic journey through the perils and pitfalls of loving the wrong people. Sometimes love comes in as an \\"intermezzo\\" to reality, but whether or not it endures is hardly the point. The point is that it happened- and you remember.

B000000QFV|5.0|Most of this album's detractors really knock it because this doesn't sound like the older Ozzy era stuff. Even if they liked Dio or other Sabbath replacements, this really is an album that stands on its own musically and is unique in the Sabbath catalog.    One good way to sort out people who just want to head bang from the rest of the people who like good musical execution and writing is to consider the similarities of good heavy metal musicians and virtuosos from the romantic, classical, and baroque periods such as Mozart, Bach and Franz Liszt. I believe this album would have had musical appeal to many of the great composers and musicians (religious affiliations aside as this album deals with Norse Mythology). Sure, this isn't all \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"War Pigs\\", but to be honest it does have a greater appeal in musical technique than some of the band's early offerings.    As I hinted at previously, this isn't a simple \\"turn up and head bang\\" album, the attraction here goes much deeper into technical musicianship than that and I believe this is where most of those who criticize get lost on it. It certainly may have received more of a fair chance if it did not bear the Sabbath name and have to answer for itself in the face of past Sabbath albums.

B000000OMB|2.0|I remember when this cd was released in the 80's...the supergroup made of some great musicians of prog music....this album got immediate success, everybody liked it.  Now listen to this cd again and realize how this was a poor cd.  I did and I can say that this album is really poor and I won't listen to it for the rest of my life, this is the kind of pop prog for the mass and has nothing to do with real prog music.  Instead, look for what these guys has made in the 70's with their respective bands and you'll see the difference....
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Wow, this is one angry review page. I, too, will lament the absence of special features, so there's no disagreement from me there, but for the purposes of this writing, I just want to focus on the actual movie. And, as we all seem to agree, it's an absolute classic.<br /><br />POLTERGEIST is one of the best horror films ever made, period. For those of you who've never seen it, here's the setup:<br /><br />An all-American family, headed by Craig Nelson and JoBeth Williams as post-hippie-now-yuppie parents, move into a new house in scenic, idyllic Cuesta Verda, along with three kids and a dog. Nelson is an up and coming real estate agent who's been left in the dark about the VERY hinky circumstances regarding this particular suburban housing project.<br /><br />Very soon, the house is beseiged by ghosts of the past, monsters that seem to be cut from white mist, gargantuan garden trees, and, well ... an exploding steak. The youngest child, Carol Ann, is kidnapped by the ghosts and kept in a parallel, electronic dimension hidden somewhere behind the screen of their television set. I ask you, how's THAT for originality?<br /><br />The performances are top notch, the writing is witty and real, and--strangely--the 1982 special effects still hold up wonderfully. Also, it made the PG rating, so your kids can watch it (if they're not subject to night terrors, that is).<br /><br />There are a lot of rumors about behind-the-scenes difficulties and dramas--some of them decidedly paranormal--that really would have been worth an extra disc of special features. I want that. But the movie is five-star entertainment, in any format.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
B000NVL9KG|4.0|When it comes to Emerson Lake & Palmer, one of two pieces is usually voted the band's pinnacle of achievement: \\"Karn Evil 9\\" from 1973's BRAIN SALAD SURGERY or the titular suite from 1971's TARKUS. And if \\"Karn Evil 9\\" is one of my top candidates for Best Prog Work Ever, \\"Tarkus\\" is a monolithic achievement nevertheless, one of the first sidelong epics in the annals of progressive rock, and one of its greatest.    Flying high on Keith Emerson's savage keyboards, grounded by Carl Palmer's seismic drumming, embroidered with Greg Lake's dour vocals and complementary bass licks, \\"Tarkus\\" alternates peaks of the loftiest beauty with storms of the basest profanity. There's a plot in Lake's overblown lyrics somewhere - I think it has to do with war, and the armadillo-tank on the LP cover, and something about a manticore as well - but lyrics have never been all that important in prog. They sound profound, and that's all that matters. The suite is partitioned into seven movements, but it's often difficult, amidst the hail of screaming organ solos and percussive whiplash, to discern where one ends and another begins. Besides, I listen to \\"Tarkus\\" as a whole, a mammoth example of everything good (and bad) about prog rock, so it's rather pointless to focus on the individual parts. It's a monster, to be sure, some of the most intricate, bloodthirstily confrontational music of the rock era.    Two prog workouts (\\"Bitches Crystal\\", \\"A Time & a Place\\"), a pair of goofy throwaways (\\"Jeremy Bender\\", \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\"), and a bipartite mini-epic (\\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\"/\\"Infinite Space(Conclusion)\\") flesh out the remainder of the disc. After a behemothic opening like the title cut, the rest of TARKUS should be an anticlimax, and in many ways it is. But if it doesn't achieve the demented grandeur of Side I, Side II allows the band to calm down, stretch out, and defuse their self-conscious pomposity a bit. \\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\"/\\"Infinite Space (Conclusion)\\" in particular is great, featuring ecclesiastical organ, blazing bass figures, and a couple melodies \\"borrowed\\" from Bach.    If 70s prog ever needed a \\"poster band\\", there would be few acts better qualified to fill that role than ELP. By the same token, TARKUS plays about as near a 70s prog \\"poster album\\" as any album possibly could.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Better direction highlights THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, an all too rare case of a sequel actually outdoing a fine original.<br /><br />Jason Bourne is on the run again--and, just as in the original, the pursuers are assassins, the CIA, and his own past. It seems that settling down for the quiet life just isn't in the cards for our put-upon hero; indeed, as so much of the last movie built towards him finding peace with his new girlfriend, it's more than a little jarring to watch her get wasted mere minutes after the opening credits. Oh, well. It's the LETHAL WEAPON 2 syndrome all over again--you can't have a pesky relationship get in the way of all the intrigue, betrayals, butt-whuppin', and car chasin' that has to be squeezed into a two hour action flick.<br /><br />It could have been different. Bourne could have quietly disappeared, you see, if it weren't for those downright inconvenient CIA bigwigs framing him for knocking off government field agents. And, of course, it's not even that simple. Things get very complicated and clever in this second installment of the Bourne trilogy, and the disciplined hand of Paul Greengrass is an upgrade in the direction of the tale.<br /><br />I could tell you more, but then I'd have to ... oh, you get the idea ...<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")
B000002J2B|4.0|WIND & WUTHERING, released in 1976, would be Genesis' final album with guitarist Steve Hackett, and the band sees him off in classy fashion. Kicking off with \\"The Eleventh Earl of Mar\\", a mock-epic about an ineffectual nobleman placed in command of a battle not because of his skill but because of his bloodline (sound familiar?), the record maintains a consistent level of quality throughout. In keeping with its autumnal cover art, the tone of WIND & WUTHERING is more sombre than that of its predecessor, A TRICK OF THE TAIL, with Tony Banks' reverb-soaked keyboards driving the band's sound. His ten-minute epic \\"One for the Vine\\" is my favourite track here, a multi-sectional satire of organized religion with some brilliant time, tempo, and dynamic changes.    The three-track medley that ends the LP is also magnificent. The first movement, the atmospheric \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers...\\" segues (appropriately enough) into the storming, group-composed \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\", which features some of the finest drumming I've ever heard from Phil Collins - brilliant stuff. The medley concludes with another Tony Banks number: \\"Afterglow\\", which to this day remains a fan favourite. Other highlights include the very English sociopolitical satire \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" and Mike Rutherford's first solo composition for the group, \\"Your Own Special Way\\", which became their second \\"hit\\" (after \\"I Know What I Like (in Your Wardrobe)\\").    Following Steve Hackett's departure Genesis would progress steadily toward a more commercial sound - actually, Hackett's defection ended up having a much greater impact on the band's direction than Peter Gabriel's had two years previous. So many fans consider WIND & WUTHERING a \\"last hurrah\\" of sorts for Genesis, the prog giants, before the emergence of Genesis, the pop superstars. Either way, it's an excellent addition to the collection of a listener who's a fan of both bands.
B0002HMQUS|4.0|I ordered this to shoot indoor sports with a 70-200 f/2.8 zoom lens.  It worked really well.  The top section of the monopod is covered in some sturdy-feeling foam.

It just fell off somewhere.  Not good.
B00005NB8K|2.0|I have watched other Oliver Stone movies before and liked them.  I don't know what he or anyone else was thinking when they made this movie.  It was a mess.  Maybe I need to be drunk or stoned to appreciate it.      This movie was very poorly written.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that it makes Jim Morrison look like a drunken jerk.  It was either way too long or way too slow.  Either way, it did not hold my interest.  Meg Ryan was a doll in other movies of hers.  But in here?  She just could not live up to the material.  She was definitely a poor casting choice in this movie.    If you like The Doors, I am sure that there are better choices out there than this garbage.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|A stunning operatic DVD!<br /><br />This DVD was recorded live at the open air Waldbuhne  amphitheater in Berlin on July 7, 2006. It features Placido Domingo, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon with Marco Armiliato conducting the Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin. The program featured a medley of cherished operatic staples.<br /><br />20,000 people got to witness one superb performance after another on this pleasant summer's evening; what thrill it must have been to have actually been there. Domingo, looking grayer and somewhat older, has lost none of his voice over the years nor any of his passion; he seemed a comfortable fit for the rising stars of Netrebko and Villazon.<br /><br />Highlight of the disc:<br />So many to choose from, so obviously a subjective choice; but I'd have to pick  Netrobko and Villazon (as Mimi and Rodolfo) singing the love duet ' O soave fanciulla ' from Puccini's \\"La Boheme\\". Being a sentimentalist, this piece has always had a emotional effect on me, but none much stronger than rendition performed here. Stirring to watch.<br /><br />And finally, and I guess it goes without saying, but you really need a decent stereo system to appreciate this disc; I initially played this DVD through a friend's TV speakers and the quality (sound) was disappointing to say the least. However on a home theater system the full, rich quality of the music was evident.  5 Stars, more if I could.<br /><br />R. Nicholson

B000FWHVKA|5.0|I listen to a decent amount of heavily-electronic artists, but wow!, when I appropriated Silent Shout into my rotation, I'd not the faintest idea how quickly it would rise to the top and remain there.  It is going to take an utter masterpiece to even come close to touching the third release of The Knife.  This, like many others have asserted, is not for your casual listener.  I know from several of my friends' reactions that this music is addicting but can be quite macabre at times.  Not that it makes much difference, but until I read that Olaf lays down no vocals on this album, I myself was more fearful of it.  I guess the discovery that Karin does all the vocals (even the terrifying chants of \\"One Hit\\") brings the album down to reality: that this is a human being, whose voice is tweaked further than most artists would ever fathom, not some monster providing vocals; although, incidentally, the song is sung from the perspective of a monster of sorts: a misogynistic one.  This album is avant-garde mainly because it does what most other electronic albums don't; it simultaneously sounds like it was produced with a computer but not pre-programmed.  When I listen to many electronic albums I get the impression that the artist is simply laying down vocals on beats that came with their machine, rather than creating anything remotely interesting, worthwhile or unique.  No matter how dancy Silent Shout gets there is an omnipresent and insidious gloom lurking about in each song.  Take the album as a whole, give it a few listens and check out the title track, \\"Neverland\\", \\"We Share Our Mother's Health\\", \\"Marble House\\" and \\"Like A Pen\\" if you are skeptical.  Although their previous two releases are better than most electronic albums, The Knife, like wine and some cheeses, get better with age.
0553278223|5.0|I love this best of all Bradbury's books. At times eerie, sometimes ironic, always captivating, this collection of short stories forged into a single novel tells science fiction as it should be, colored by the non-cynical hopes for the future still in full bloom during its Golden Age.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|*possible spoilers*<br /><br />It seems somehow appropriate that \\"The Lives of Others\\" should be set in 1984, since it takes us to a world where George Orwell's fictional Big Brother has become an all-too-real fact of everyday life.  The place is East Germany, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, where not just every action but virtually every thought can be surveyed and monitored by the secret police agency known as STASI.  As self-appointed \\"voices of the people,\\" artists suffer an even more intense level of scrutiny than the average, everyday citizen.  As a result, many of them have either fled the country, committed suicide, or compromised their artistic vision in exchange for security and safety.  Georg Dreyman, a successful writer and dramatist, has chosen the latter course of action, towing the party line in his works better than most of his fellow artists.  Nevertheless, Wiesler, a security agent with STASI, suspects that Dreyman may not be quite the ideological purist Wiesler's fellow officers believe him to be (Wiesler may also be motivated by the fact that he is attracted to Dreyman`s beautiful girlfriend, a well-known stage actress named Christa-Marie Sieland, and, thus, has reasons of his own for wanting Dreyman out of the picture).  To confirm his suspicions, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment bugged so that he and Sieland can be kept under surveillance twenty-four hours a day.  After awhile, however, Wiesler begins to soften in his stance towards Dreyman and, before long, he is betraying his own vows to the state by whitewashing his official reports on the writer.<br /><br />Within this historical context, \\"The Lives of Others\\" provides a chilling portrait of what life is like under a totalitarian regime.  It shows the dehumanization that occurs when freedom of thought and expression become anathema to a society, and the untenable paranoia that develops when one must live in constant fear of betrayal from stranger, acquaintance and loved-one alike.<br /><br />Interestingly, the two main characters in the film share very little screen time together, yet they are intricately linked in their roles of the observer and the observed.  Dreyman is a man willing to go along with a system he knows to be wrong, partly out of fear, but partly too out of a sincere belief that nothing he can do, even as an artist, will ever really change things.  It isn't until a close friend of his, a \\"blacklisted\\" theater director, decides to take his own life rather than to live with the oppression that Dreyman wakes up from his lethargy and takes a proactive stance against injustice.<br /><br />Wiesler has a less clearly defined moment of epiphany, and this strikes me as being one of the very few weaknesses of this otherwise extraordinarily fine film.  If Wiesler has a literary antecedent, it would have to be Guy Montag, the fire-starting protagonist in Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\"  Like Montag, Wiesler is a gung-ho advocate of a regressive regime, eagerly performing his duty of stamping out what he believes to be seditious and subversive elements that threaten the stability of the society.  But whereas Montag has his unmistakably paradigm-shifting moment while reading \\"David Copperfield,\\" Wiesler has no comparable event to explain his 180-degree turnabout in outlook.  He just suddenly goes from being Dreyman's bitterest antagonist to his greatest protector and champion without a whole lot of explanatory detail to go along with the change.  It's difficult for us to accept the fact that a man would suddenly turn his back on everything he's dedicated his life to without at least a vaguely articulated reason for doing so.<br /><br />As Wiesler, the late great actor, Ulrich Muhe, leaves an indelible mark in his portrayal of a man whose cold, emotionless surface may be more the product of his environment than a reflection of the true man at the core of his being.  In a largely nonverbal role, Muhe is forced to convey much of his character's thoughts, feelings and emotions through his piercing eyes and tightly pursed lips.  Sebastian Koch brings a remarkable subtlety to the role of the writer, while Martina Gedeck as his girlfriend, and Ulrich Tukur as Wiesler's hardnosed superior deliver excellent performances as well.<br /><br />In her filmmaking debut, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings both a stunning attention to detail and a strong sense of atmosphere to her work.  Given the repressive environment she is portraying, Donnersmarck wisely holds back on delivering grand sentimental gestures for most of the film - which makes the climactic moments all the more heart-wrenching and devastating when they finally arrive.<br /><br />In this age of ramped-up fear and paranoia - and the increased scrutiny and surveillance that come along with them - \\"The Lives of Others\\" serves as a stark reminder of the things we lose when we give up our freedoms.d emotions through his piercing eyes and tightly pursed lips.

B000M341QE|5.0|\\"The Departed\\" is an excellent cop thriller revolving around Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and his inside man, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is embedded within the police force. Sullivan gives the impression of heading up the Costello investigation, when in reality he's secretly feeding Frank enough information to keep his buddy one step ahead of the police. Meanwhile, disgraced police cadet William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is pressured into going undercover as one of Costello's newest soldiers. Costigan attempts to help the police bring down Costello and identify the leak within the Boston P.D.<br /><br />This film is fast-paced and very exciting throughout. There are many multiple subplots that involve Sullivan and Costigan searching for each other and simultaneously romancing the same woman (Vera Farmiga). The film also contains excellent supporting roles played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, who deliver powerful (and at times hilarious) performances. \\"The Departed\\" never loses momentum, and it's full of surprising twists and turns right up until the final scene. The cast is excellent and everyone delivers outstanding performances. I think the only gripe I have about the movie is that Damon's Boston accent tends to fade in and out from scene to scene, which becomes pretty annoying after a while. Still, it was great to see Damon play a slimy character for once, and watching Damon, DiCaprio and Nicholson interact onscreen was wonderful: They're all excellent actors, and every scene was fabulous.<br /><br />I'll probably purchase \\"The Departed\\" on DVD, as it's one of those movies I'll be able to enjoy again and again. It is also quite possibly the best cop movie ever. I'm so glad that Martin Scorsese won an Oscar for it.

055358894X|5.0|Locke Lamora is not your typical epic fantasy protagonist. He's not broad of chest. He does not wield astounding magical abilities. He's not good with a sword, or particularly heroic. In fact, he doesn't excel at most of what one might consider typical heroic activities. What he does excel at is the art of the con. He's a conman extraordinaire, and along with his gang of Gentleman Bastards, he robs from the rich, but before you go comparing him to Robin Hood, note that instead of giving the loot to the poor, he keeps it for himself. (Though if you do want to compare him to Robin Hood, it's fair to say that Locke does have his roguish charm.)<br /><br />Although Locke was naturally drawn to thieving as a youth, his thieving was too much even for Camorr's thiefmaker, so Locke is sold to Father Chains, the Eyeless Priest of Perelandro; the thiefmaker says it was either that, or slit the boys throat and throw him in the bay. Thankfully for Locke (and the reader), Chains takes the boy in, and teaches him to steal in a more productive way: by conning people. If that might seem an odd thing for a priest to do, consider first that Chains is not really eyeless at all. The Temple of Perelandro is really nothing more than a front for criminal activities. The god is real enough to Camorr's citizens, though he is a sort of outsider god--the thirteenth member of a pantheon of twelve--and he is the patron of thieves and beggars.<br /><br />The city of Camorr, which is said to have been built of \\"Elderglass\\" by a long forgotten race, is a vast, sprawling metropolis, riddled with canals and crime, quite reminiscent of ancient Venice, if ancient Venice were overrun by gangs and run by royalty, merchants, and criminals (actually, perhaps it's not so different). On the surface, Camorr appears to be ruled by a Duke, but in reality it is run by the crime boss, Capa Barsavi. But there's someone stalking the city--a man calling himself The Gray King--who thinks it's time for a regime change. Through a series of events, Locke finds himself matched against this man, who has been murdering Barsavi's garristas (or captains, if you're familiar with mob-parlance). And if Locke has any hope of coming out of his encounter with the Gray King alive, he's going to have make the most out of all his wits and cunning, for the Gray King is no easy mark.<br /><br />Above I mentioned how Locke Lamora is not your typical epic fantasy protagonist. Well, in many ways, the novel itself is not your typical epic fantasy. The entire story takes place within the city of Camorr, and the entire world is not threatened by some evil malefactor. Also, there is very little in the novel, aside from its secondary world setting, that is actually fantastic. In fact, the first third of the novel or so is almost entirely devoid of fantasy elements, leaving aside mention of gods (which the people believe in, but don't manifest themselves in any way) and the use of various medicinal tinctures. The first third is also almost entirely character-driven, and it isn't until then that the plot truly gets moving. Once the plot begins in earnest, fantasy elements enter the story--a wicked Bondsmage in the employ of the Gray King wields some magic--but even then, the fantasy elements mostly stay in the background. Which is not to say that any of this is a flaw, quite the contrary; the minimal use of fantasy elements allows Lynch to focus on making his world seem like a very real place, and allows him to make his characters remain at the forefront of the novel, rather than relegating them as subservient to showy pyrotechnics (though of those, there are some).<br /><br />The book starts with Locke as a young boy, still learning the ropes from Father Chains, and once Lynch shifts to Locke as an adult, he continues to weave in a series of interludes in which the reader gets to see more of Locke's past. And here's why the fact that the plot doesn't really get started until a third of the way through isnot a flaw; I found most enjoyable the parts of the book detailing Locke's youth, and relished getting to each interlude to continue reading about him. Adult Locke is a lot of fun too, and he continues to be a compelling character, but there's something special about Locke's younger days. I can only hope that we continue to see more of these interludes in future installments in this series.<br /><br />But that's not the only element of the book that can be further explored. Lynch's worldbuilding is truly outstanding, and even though he paints quite a vivid picture, there remain enough subtle hints and mentions throughout the book that leave him room to explore the world more fully as the series continues. For instance, the fact that Camorr is said to have been built of \\"Elderglass\\" by a long forgotten race is interesting, but who they are or where they've gone is never really covered. It's touches like this that lends the world an air of mystique, and fills the reader with curiosity for what will come next.<br /><br />And speaking of future installments, it's worth pointing out that although The Lies of Locke Lamora is book one in a projected seven-book cycle, the novel stands alone remarkably well. There is a definite and complete story arc from first page to last. But here's where Lynch pulls off a extraordinary feat: although the book came to a satisfying conclusion, I found myself wanting to pick up book two immediately.<br /><br />Many of Lynch's influences are clear--the first and obvious debt Locke Lamora owes is to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories--but despite the fact that much of the style and tone of the novel is reminiscent of prior works, Lynch borrows (or perhaps pilfers would be a better term, considering the protagonist) with deft skill, taking inspirational bits from a variety of sources and melding them together into something that feels wholly original.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is a vibrant, engaging epic fantasy of the highest order. And to hear that coming from me is really saying something, because of all of the subgenres I read in, epic fantasy is perhaps the hardest to sell me on. Move over Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind--here's a big fat fantasy that'll actually make you glad it's epic-length.ble the parts of the book detailing Locke's youth, and relished getting to each interlude to continue reading about him. Adult Locke is a lot of fun too, and he continues to be a compelling character, but there's something special about Locke's younger days.

Many of Lynch's influences are clear--the first and obvious debt Locke Lamora owes is to Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories--but despite the fact that much of the style and tone of the novel is reminiscent of prior works, Lynch borrows (or perhaps pilfers would be a better term, considering the protagonist) with deft skill, taking inspirational bits from a variety of sources and melding them together into something that feels wholly original.    The Lies of Locke Lamora is a vibrant, engaging epic fantasy of the highest order. And to hear that coming from me is really saying something, because of all of the subgenres I read in, epic fantasy is perhaps the hardest to sell me on. Move over Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind--here's a big fat fantasy that'll actually make you glad it's epic-length.

B00005JPMZ|4.0|I grew up with the original cartoon, read the comics, played the games, so I was pretty excited when this new movie was announced.<br /><br />Despite its low ratings on [...], TMNT fans will love this. Yeah, it's not Kurosawa or John Ford, but what many critics failed to see was that it was a great, fun moving action adventure cartoon with a lot more depth than most other cartoons.<br /><br />The story itself is pretty complicated and cherry picks from the previous 3 movies, the new cartoon and the original comic. It seems to mostly take off of the new cartoon, but not always.

B000001FQQ|4.0|I have the Kissology II 3 DVD set and it has an incredible drum solo on it by Eric Carr in the section for the Hot In The Shade tour and what I'd like to know is if he had the cancer the night he did that particular show? Because if he did then I don't see how he did that if he was tired from the cancer in his heart. It is a very sad thing that he died. Very Very Unfair as Paul Stanley put it in the liner notes. Also what other bands was he in before he joined Kiss.<br /><br /> laughingpig1@yahoo.com
B000MM1F5A|5.0|I had heard of Mariza by chance from a fellow fan of Amalia Rodrigues and rented the DVD of the Lisboa concert.  That was it, I was hooked and had to have this music.  Mariza is not \\"the new Amalia\\", she is Mariza, and she is a great fado singer in her own right. I have listened to nothing but this CD for the past 2 or 3 weeks...Mariza is addictive!  The music is so emotional & moving and you don't have to speak Portuguese to love it.  Also, the bonus CD (which is in English) has a lot of good information about the history of fado, and good ambience footage of Lisbon. An excellent buy.
B00005J6UP|5.0|My kids loved this movie when they were children, and now they love it all over again. I was going to save this movie for a stocking stuffer but they found out and wanted to see it right now. So I gave in. They all sat with popcorn and raved about how good it was. Thanks for bring us all together. My kids are 17,19,21.25,27. Even I watched it. Then my little great nephew came over he loved it too.
B000UR9TPK|3.0|Try Amazon UK to get the Blu-Ray version now. It was available as of 1-2-08:<br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/Led-Zeppelin-Song-Remains-Blu-ray/dp/B000WGUPTI/ref=pd_sbs_d_h__title_3<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br /><br />Old Review:<br />I am a big fan of Led Zeppelin having seen them live in 1977 a year after this film was released. We'll have to wait and see what the final audio on these Discs contain, but if it only has a regular Dolby Digital 5.1 mix as what has been widely reported, then Led Zep has blown it again IMO. I still own the original VHS, Betamax and DVD versions, and those are stereo, certainly Not the great discrete aggressive surround sound mix I remember hearing in 1976 at the theater. I remember in the theatrical version with the proper speaker set-up Jimmy Page's guitar feedback bouncing back and forth throughout the front and rear speakers along with Robert Plant's vocals on \\"Dazed And Confused.\\" Totally awesome. That original theatrical mix is one of the \\"holy grail\\" Quad/surround mixes from the 1970's and it looks like we're never going to be able to hear it again.

B000000132|5.0|1974's \\"Turn Of The Cards\\" was the fifth Renaissance album, and once again, it's a masterpiece of classical/prog rock. Once more, the band's music is magically lush, sweeping and magnificent, with Annie Haslam's goddess-like voice leading the way. All six songs, \\"Running Hard,\\" \\"I Think Of You,\\" \\"Things I Don't Understand,\\" \\"Black Flame,\\" \\"Cold Is Being,\\" and \\"Mother Russia\\" are outstanding, played and sung to perfection by Haslam, guitarist Michael Dunford, keyboardist John Tout, bassist Jon Camp, and drummer Terry Sullivan. I'll say it again: Renaissance were---and are---a phenomenal band who deserved a much bigger worldwide audience then what they had. Their music is that good. \\"Turn Of The Cards\\" is another brilliant album from Renaissance.

1400079179|5.0|What a page-turner! But even more than that, the book gets the reader to question the unquestionable.  Not to give anything away,even though half the world has either read the book or seen the not very good movie (which was a shame),  but I had no idea where the book wwas headed when I read it on the recommendation of a friend while  it was still only available in  hardcover. I not only found the book hard to put down, but when I was forced to deal with the more mundane aspects of life (like my job and showing up for meals), I couldn't wait to get back to it. Granted, the use of Langdon and Sophie and the others where necessary to move the reader along to the Big Mystery at the novel's core, I was swept along in their search right from page one. And when I discovered the Secret, I was blown away.  Like most others, I had accepted  most of the precepts called into question; to have all that set on its ear was not only a great read, it was a revelation. Now, I hope I haven't given anything away for the 5 people out there who haven't come in contact with this book. It's a great read; it's a great mysery dealing with the greatest mystery of them all.  It may even shake your foundation.

067158037X|5.0|I listened to the Recorded Books Unabridged version of this on tape--narrated by the author.  What a treat!  I'm sure it must have been better than reading it myself.  I cried and sometimes I giggled and belly laughed.  Many have reviewed the book and most were riveted to it as I was.  How I wished I could have scooped up those kids and given them a good life.

B000ETRCMQ|4.0|This is the sort of movie I'd watch again easily. I thoroughly enjoyed Felicity Huffman's performance as a transgender who discovers she has a son from a teenage one night stand. The movie has many memorable moments including some funny scenes. This was not a mainstream film, and I think that is probably due to the theme, but it really is very good. Felicity is a brilliant actor as is the young actor who plays her son.  I am glad to own this movie, and will watch it again sometime soon. THe only negative I have is that it is a bit choppy in parts, perhaps the editing could have been done a little better.  That aside, a great film!
B00005JO20|2.0|It's strange, but looking at the reviews this movie seems to be a love/hate movie. I can't imagine what makes it so polarizing. I found it cringe-worthy.    My biggest gripes: nearly every action scene is cartoonish. A stampeding horde of brontosauruses not only can't outrun humans... it runs with them, over top them, without stepping on anyone. For several minutes. The same problem happens with the rest of the crazy dinosaur/island creatures... they don't seem to adhere to any principle of physics and motion, but gnash and crash and fall down all over the place while magically avoiding the main characters.     Another problem is the love story. Why would a woman care about a freaking monkey? One that has eaten human sacrifices for decades, and that destroys everything whenever he feels like cutting lose. She doesn't recognize that part of him, just that he's a big sweet monkey who has love in his heart too. Aw[...] Not only that she doesn't just seem to like him as a friend. She seems to want to marry him. A 30 foot tall, man eating monkey. Of course, that's the original story, but they failed to help explain it any better.    One more gripe: Jack Black. Great guy, very funny. He screws up this movie because it's not a comedy. Sorry Jack but you don't belong in a dramatic action movie where everyone's waiting for you to crack jokes. He doesn't crack any, by the way, but there's the problem. He's not one of those guys who acts well outside his comedy, and as an important personality in this film it's almost embarrassing to watch him have no dramatic presence.    The one good thing is the visuals (for the most part, sometimes the CG feels disconnected from the actors), there's a lot of beauty shoved into some scenes.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|when I started collecting Bartoli's album I first got \\"A Portrait\\", which is great for the Bartoli beginner. You can hear how she started and progressed through Mozart and Donizetti. However, I believe that she shines when it comes to baroque music. She is great Rossini singer but her passion really comes through in Baroque music and on this album. From the vocal fireworks to the passionate pianissimos, this is an album to show that pre-classical music is wonderful to listen to. Minkowski wonderfully backs her up. If I may say, another album to hear his group is on \\"Anne Sofie Von Otter sings Offenbach.\\" However back to Opera Proibita, this is a great album to appreciate Bartoli's flexibility and musicality.
B0002IQFLI|5.0|I was looking for new movies for my daughter for Christmas and I couldn't beat the price of this 2 pack! She loves cat in the hat movies!
B000M341QE|3.0|While I'm a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio as an actor, the main story of the Departed was pretty uninteresting overall (not to mention confusing).  I wasn't sure what was even happening half the time because of how clumsy the story rolled along with quick snapshots of storyline immediately leading into other short scenes.  The whole movie was created this way, almost appearing as a documentary.      Furthermore, the Irish accents made it hard to understand what some of the people were even saying.  You have to know the Irish to understand some of the sentences and expressions that were used in this film.  I believe understanding the Irish way of life is extremely important in order to get what the movie is about.  If the story was maybe more focused instead of just going into the same confusing pattern of frequent short scenes all attached together in an attempt to make a BIG story, maybe I would have enjoyed the movie more.  Again, I can't say enough about Leonardo Dicaprio's performance.  He was excellent.  Unfortunately the story wasn't good or presented in an easy to understand manner to keep me interested.
B000LC3ID8|3.0|I am not usually attracted to this type of film...slasher/horror flicks, that is. I find most of them a waste of money and time, to be honest. This is why I was genuinely shocked at how I truly loved the first two \\"Saw\\" films, realizing they exercised absolutely brilliant examples of film-making, acting, and special effects. Both films had a genuinely awesome screenplay with well-written, realistically portrayed dialogue...and of course, forgetting the almost-too-intense amounts of suspense both films lavished upon its viewers would be criminal. Some of the scenes in those films brought on the nail-biting suspense I hadn't felt since Ridley Scott's \\"Alien.\\" I remember being sick with jealousy after watching the first film that novice filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell could create such a brilliant, intricate, breathtaking horror film that had just the right amounts of blood & guts mixed with a truckload of otherworldly suspense. I remember after watching the second film that Darren Lynn Bousman seriously has got a future on his hands with an exquisitely directed \\"Saw II.\\" So, naturally, I felt more than compelled to view the third installation of the \\"Saw\\" franchise before the fourth film hit theaters. Described as \\"staggeringly violent\\" and \\"sadistically horrific,\\" along with the true incidents of audience members vomiting and fainting in the theater, I felt less and less excited about the third Saw film, and began thinking it was nothing more than a Halloween horror film face-off between Saw III and Hostel to see which film could possibly be more sickeningly violent. In addition, I began to think \\"How could a third film possibly live up to the caliber of the first two?\\" After viewing the third film, I really wasn't sure what to think of the theory of the film being violent just to be violent. But here's what I generally thought of the third installation to the brilliant \\"Saw\\" franchise. The interlocking two-part story deals with a fatally ill Jigsaw capturinga doctor who must keep him alive for however long it takes for a man, who is psychologically insane with his lust for revenge for the drunk driver who killed his son, to maneuver through a series of Jigsaw's infamous \\"traps.\\" Jeff, the man, is not actually in the traps, though--it's the people who he's been vengeful towards regarding the death of his son--for instance, the judge who locked away the killer for only a short period of time, and witnesses who didn't do anything. Jeff has the power to stop these traps--find it within himself to forgive them. Either that, or watch them get slaughtered in ways too shocking to write about in this review.    That said, Saw III is definitely a step up when it comes to the gore meter compared to the first two films. Some of the traps are so sickening you feel compelled to turn away from the screen. People vomiting in theaters, though, is a gross overreaction. I ate pizza while watching and I wasn't really nauseated or anything. Don't let that fool you, though--Saw III is extremely violent and the violence in the first two films is pale compared to it. There are plenty of moments where I cringed and thought to myself, \\"Holy crap, that's just wrong.\\" While a part of me wants to condemn the film for being so excruciatingly violent, I can't help but think the violence was a necessary aspect to the story. You'd really have to see the film to know what I'm talking about here, but anyway, Saw III might've competed with Hostel for \\"most violent award\\" but the gore wasn't extremely over-the-top or too intense to watch.    Which brings me into my next point--the storyline. As I said in the first paragraph, the story lines for the first two film blew me out of the damn water with their brilliance. This is where the third film declines--and steeply, at that. The development of new characters is handled extremely poorly and in the end, you really don't give a flying crap who dies and who is left living (extremely unlike the second film).The acting is both up and down at different times. Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are absolutely top notch, as always. Smith's performance, especially towards the end of the film, sent chills down my spine and Bell never fails to disappoint. Yet, literally every single other actor/actress in the film didn't deliver, and that for me was major point loss.    I liked the directing, editing, and cinematography. Especially the cinematography, which reminded me immensely of the 2004 Denzel Washington action flick \\"Man On Fire,\\" also dealing with the human spirit's lust for revenge at the loss of another. Fortunately, Darren Lynn Bousman's above-average skills as a film director manage to balance a close-to-falling Saw III and keep it shakily on its feet. Again, I blame this on the weak story. Yet, it is hardly fair for me to completely condemn the story. The screenwriters did a very good job incorporating flashbacks into the film, and explaining elements from the first two films that may have been considered plot holes in the past. This aspect to Saw 3 was immensely enjoyable and made for a good film.    Though, the ending was also very poor, in my opinion. It is very depressing, unhealthy, and unsatisfying like a Big Mac. You almost feel at a complete loss--the events building up from the beginning of the film (and, for that matter, the other two films as well) end up--like this? Bleh. Been there, done that. There also is no shocker at the end, unlike the first two films which each had shockers that pretty much blew the brains out of your ears and left you speechless and unable to move.    Still, though, Saw 3 is a decent film. But it should be understood that unless you are EXTREME fans of the first two films, as I am, you should stay away from this movie. You'll be revolted and disappointed, to say the least. But for hardcore Saw fans, it should be rather pleasing. I don't think \\"Saw 3\\" was a great film, But it certainly is decent and I've seen FAR worse. I have hopes for the fourth film that it may redeem the third film and restore the hopes of me and a million others that a great movie--turned into just a decent one--can be brought back to greatness.    3-Stars
0375507256|4.0|Truly original works of fiction are hard to find these days. David Mitchell has given us such a work. Most of what's out there is like candy, fun to take in and soon forgotten. Mitchell doesn't take such a low view of the reader. This is an extremely challenging work which will reward the reader willing to open his mind and take in the story on a deeper level than what's on the surface.    The book is structured like a Russian nesting doll. Each story is somehow interrelated with the story after it. There are six stories total here. Mitchell ends stories one through five abruptly, and then tells all of story six, and tells the ends of the rest of the stories five to one. It's a very unique structure, and it says something about Mitchell's abilities that he's able to make it work.    Each story is also totally different in terms of style. We begin with a Melvillean tale of the sea, proceed to an English rogue's story, then a hardboiled 70s pulp mystery, then the story of a contemporary degenerate English book publisher, forwarded to a dystopian scifi tale set in the near future, and finally a halting, odd narrative of a man living in a post apocalyptic Hawaii. Each story has a distinct narrative style and has little in common with the preceding story, save the link.    This book gets the reader thinking about many themes. The main theme is breaking free of the shackles life puts on us. Each narrator is somehow constrained, either by society or the government. It also explores the effect rules for the society have on the individual. There are a few other minor themes, but you really should read the book to find out what they are.    My only quibble with this was the sixth story. The narration was so stilted and disjointed that I found it tough to finish it. I ultimately did not, because it was so tough to get through. This is my own failing, and I will have to read it at some point in the near future. It's one of the many challenges Mitchell puts to the reader.    This is a masterful work, which is sure to reveal new truths with each reading.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|This movie was a huge waste of time. The story was pointless; it was simply of little value. What good thing could be said of this movie? Nada.  I was hoping for something more from this fabulously overhyped piece of junk. It's a bad movie because these people simply have no redeeming features about them. As a result, the movie seems overly contrived and without direction. Avoid this one like the plague; you'll be better off saving a few books.
B000J10ERO|5.0|SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE OUTTA THIS WORLD, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR 5 LONG YEARS FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT. IF YOU'RE SUPERMAN FAN WAS WORTH THE WAIT. BRANDON ROUTH PLAYED CLARK KENT/SUPERMAN SO GREAT THAT I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST MOVIE BY FAR AS SUPERMAN'S MOVIES.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I have to say that I have watched a lot of movies, probably like everyone else on this page. However, I consider myself to be sort-of a film buff and I think 8 1/2 is one of the best movies ever made. I can completely understand why some people do not like the film, or feel that others who do are trying to be stuck up, superior, artsy fartsy jerks. But, make no mistake, 8 1/2 is an amazing movie; and, even though you may not understand everything, that does not make the film \\"bad\\". Some movies take patience, maybe even some research, and sometimes a few more viewings, before the viewer can fully appreciate what the director is trying to accomplish. Some of my favorite movies I hated the first time I watched them. Yet, I gave those movies another try because I thought that I must have overlooked something,  that for some reason I was not glimpsing the true vision of the Director.   Most people want to see movies that they have already seen. Many movies are just repeat plot tricks, with the same characters and heros and anti-heros. Doesn't anyone want to see a movie that attempts to unveil a part of the soul, not one that simply aims at that base desire to be entertained. Just give 8 1/2 a try, I don't think It could hurt!

B00005NC66|5.0|This film is the best of the French New Wave of films. It is continually entertaining and keeps the viewer involved. I love the candid shots films on Paris streets. While Truffaut is the most human of the New Wave directors, Godard is easily the most challenging and inventive.

B0000248VB|5.0|I have been ordering Mancini cds lately because his music brings back a feeling when I was young.  My parents had Mancini music on during their dinner parties, cocktail parties and of course everyone was smoking away.....mom and dad had those sterling silver cigarette boxes filled just like they filled the ice bucket!  Ha!  Remember those times?  Anyway, this music puts me back in a time when I was cared for, safe and protected.  What's funny is when our 26 year old son came home recently and heard the music for the first time he stopped, listened and said, \\"I like this music, makes the house feel happy.\\"  Yep, that just about sums it up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This has probably been one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi series. While it was okay, I was never much of a Buffy fan. I did watch Angel and enjoyed the humor of it. So it's not that I think Joss Weedon can do no wrong.<br /><br />I've watched everything from the original and new Treks, to Star Wars, to Stargate, Soylent Green, Highlander, etc.<br /><br />But Firefly was something fresh that I connected to personally. I'm sorry I missed out when it aired and was only a fan after someone loaned me the DVD collection. I watched the first episode \\"Serenity\\" and thought it was okay. By the time I got to the end of the first DVD I was hooked, couldn't stop watching it.<br /><br />If you're unsure about the series, find a friend to borrow it and then buy. Everyone I've loaned it to has loved it and gotten a copy.

B000RGSOR8|5.0|For a full length debut CD I found this one to be surprisingly polished.  This performer is serious about her art.  She has drawn freely from diverse music styles and influences and created a sophisticated, wide ranging style that suits her considerable talents well.  If you're looking for upbeat dance music, this CD is probably not for you.  This one is best applied to thoughtful moods and evening interludes.  St. Vincent has commanded my respect as  an artist to watch.  I can't wait for her next release.
B00008F5RX|5.0|Longtime Yes fans know about the civil war that erupted between the two factions of Yes in the late '80s-1990.  The \\"West\\" lineup owned the name, so the \\"East\\" lot had to use a lawyer's office byline.  It was still Yes as far as fans were concerned, given the endless turnover throughout the years.  (Let's just call a spade a shovel!)<br />This concert was recorded and filmed on 9 September 1989 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountainview, CA (outside San Jos&eacute;, as Jon Anderson mentioned, around where he lives now).  Session players filled out the rest of the band (Stick-master Tony Levin was on sick leave).<br />Tracks from the sole studio album and old Yes chestnuts are featured.  I have the original EU indie release from 1993, and \\"Starship Trooper\\" is omitted.  It was on the 1994 US edition on Herald/Caroline I used to have (real fans would buy some imports).<br />There are some typos.  The biggest is \\"Gone But Not Forgotten\\", a poignant Rick Wakeman instrumental from 1983, which isn't here, but \\"Madrigal\\" from 1978's \\"Tormato\\", is instead used in his solo medley.  \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" is performed acoustically in Anderson's solo allotment, as the others may not have wanted to touch that one (they would on the \\"Union\\" and other later tours, however).<br />Not wanting to leave out Bill Bruford, his drumming is stronger than before, where he had a more of a jazz fusion approach, which he still uses, I suppose.<br />This was recently reissued by leading UK independent Voiceprint, who have a number of solo and side releases in the Yes and Asia family.
B000RJO578|3.0|while it was funny and action packed, it took a couple of tries to not fall asleep through it.  While it is slow out of the gate, it finishes like the 2005 rose bowl.  The extra features are ok, if youre into outtakes and what not.

B000M341QE|5.0|I have been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan and he has been one of my favorite actors for years but I didn't really want to admit that to people because he is Leo DiCaprio. But since his work in this movie and Blood Diamond I feel like he has proven he is more than a pretty boy and can more than hold his own. Great acting by everyone. Mickey Rourke was orignally rumored to be wanted for Mark Wahlberg's part so it would've been intresting to see how that would've made things different but all the same great.
1559409002|3.0|Carnival of Souls did not feel like an older movie, it felt like a movie from today that was made in black and white trying to look old, like the beginning of Night of the Creeps, but nothing in this movie is at it seems.    At the beginning there is a tragic car accident that you don't really see coming and it grabs you, one of the girls from the car Mary Henry suddenly appears on the shore of the lake where the car went into.  We don't know what  Mary was like before the accident but after it she leaves town to play organ for a church in Utah, which is just a job to her and business only.  On her way late at night a freaky face of a man appears out her passenger side window, freaky at first but after you've seen him a bunch of times it becomes repetitive.  She also notices a n abandoned carnival that looks like architecture from Moscow.      Mary moves into a rooming house with a landlady and a slimy pushy idiot of  guy who is constantly trying to get with her.  Mary mostly wants no part of him nor any man at all for that matter.    Throughout the 83mins of the directors cut Mary sees hallucinations and has episodes when nobody can see or hear her, is she dreaming?  Is she going crazy?  At times Mary reminded me of Catherine Deneuve's character in Roman Polanski's [[ASIN:B0007GAG42 Repulsion]] although Catherine Deneuve was more effective, that is if she is in fact going crazy.    So, to recap, the beginning grabs you with a shocking accident you don't see coming, then quickly after we get some good atmosphere and creepy apparitions or hallucinations that lose there effectiveness as the movie goes on, and at 83mins I kept finding myself looking at how much time was left.  I'm not impatient I was into every minute of Lawrence of Arabia's 5 hours this just didn't keep me personally into it.      **Spoiler alert**    At the end we see the car from the beginning being towed out of the lake with her and her friends still in it and there dead.  So then the movie couldn't have been her dream or her going crazy.  My far fetched guess that I was thinking maybe Mary is trapped between Heaven and Hell.  The zombies at the carnival and her being drawn to it could be some kind of devils trying to take her to hell and the Priest where she plays the organ could be trying to help her as he encourages her to have faith, or I'm totally wrong.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|I loved the premise of this movie. Great people behind as well as infront of the camera! I felt that Jessica Biel couldn't quiet hold her own against some of the acting greats here but that may come with time, I think she's only 22. And I did feel she was out of place being in the story they grew up together but she's obviously 10 years younger or more. Other than that almost completely seemless work! Great movie.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This is considered by many Blind Guardian fans as their \\"Magnum Opus\\". I love this CD! To put simple it's very catch, and is a must have for any metal fan in general.
0792844890|3.0|I have seen this movie a number of times, and while it has some funny scenes, it is not at the genius level of other Mel Brooks movies (The Producers and Blazing Saddles come to mind).  The acting seems ordinary, without great delivery or presence. Mel Brooks has 2 major roles, giving a much-needed boost to the movie.
B00000IP3S|5.0|This is my favorite Blind Guardian CD of all time as well as one of the all time favorite power metal albums. I don't find a single track in this record bad, all of it its an awsome musics! I really recommend this along with all the other BG CDs the most though!
B000MCH5P4|3.0|This movie is definitely one of the stranger ones that I have seen.  It has a lot of good scenes (especially in Morocco, with the 2 boys and the tour bus shooting).  While I understand the close connection between the Morocco situation and the California/Mexico situation, with a married couple and their children, I was thrown off by the constant shifting to Japan.  The only connection between Japan and the other situations was that a Japanese guy sold a hunting rifle to a Moroccan man who then sold it to another Moroccan man who gave it to his sons, who then fired on the tour bus. However, this connection is so indirect that it becomes a little absurd to include it.  The whole Mexico situation was a little disturbing, to put it nicely.
B000GNOM78|5.0|I used to hate kung fu movies as a kid, but years later after having never seen this film, I must say I was thoroughly entertained! The story really drives this film (in it's originality) and the actors are all truly amazing; great heroes, great villains and a deadly tournament!<br /><br />The extras on this disc are numerous and make for quite a tribute to Mr. Lee, and the Lee legacy. The transfer is astonishing for its age (I love how grand it feels as the airplane flies overhead in the opening - as only HD can present) the soundtrack is very nice...a little action, a little orient and a little funk!<br /><br />Mr. Hans hands are a bit cheesy and unmenacing, but I imagine that if they were aware of what a masterpiece they were creating they surely would have put forth a little more effort in some of these minor details, but in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't matter.<br /><br />\\"Enter the Dragon\\" on HD DVD is an excellent way to take a look at the past when you're feeling nostalgic with all of its outdoor imagery from a variety of locations - this film has some wonderful shots. It's also a nice way to just have a good time when you're in the mood for a classic action movie!<br /><br />I love this film and have viewed it multiple times. I can't say enough good things about it, and it truly is a shame that Mr. Lee didn't live long enough to add a few more of these gems to Hollywood history - he really was an amazing talent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.
B000P0J024|5.0|I had owned this as a cassette when it was first released. I bought the CD and was in love with it again.  Great music from great musicians.
B000R8YC3G|5.0|I loved this movie: a little bit of gore, a little bit of heartbreak...they do their best to survive.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" brings good humour to this \\"romantic comedy with zombies\\" which comes to HD DVD with a fantastic HD picture and excellent DD+ 5.1 audio.<br /><br />The local zombies are great...I liked the female Winchester regular, she made a nice creepy zombie, as did the [chubby] black one, and Mary grows on you even more through the second viewing...they all did a really great job! They do well to give several zombies more familiarity through character development.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras on this HD DVD as well including deleted scenes, commentary, a gallery...it even follows up on a couple of happenings not shown in the film.<br /><br />This is an extremely fun movie, and I highly recommend it.

B000NA2BEU|2.0|While the first season of Veronica Mars will always be one of my favorite seasons of any show, the latter years just cannot compete.  I found the second season too convoluted, and I thought Veronica's likability was starting to fade.  The third season, however, is much too simplified.  And the worst offense?  Veronica Mars, the title character, becomes a complete Mary-Sue.  Her sleuthing skills are nowhere near the vicinity of season one, yet everyone falls in love with her and superior \\"gift.\\"  Her college professor wants to vouch for her for an FBI internship, and the college dean writes a glowing letter of recommendation.  She's able to stay on top of her college grades while working cases and cooking dinner for her father, and she requires no time or adjustment to do so.  And not only does she have Logan Echolls madly in love with her and willing to do anything to protect her, but now we have the annoying character of Piz (Wallace's college roomie) following after her.    Veronica has always been an attractive and smart character, but these things continue to happen despite her coldness, her smugness, her arrogance.  You wait and wait, expecting her to be set up for a fall so she can see the error of her ways, but it never happens.  It's obvious that the creator of the show is head-over-heels for his character, and it feels like he's lost the necessary objectiveness.  Veronica is right, you're wrong.  Even if you're a member of the audience.    This would be more bearable if there wasn't SO MUCH Veronica this year.  The first two seasons did a much better job of balancing screentime, so even though it's a show with a title character, it felt like an ensemble cast.  But this year, the amazing talent from the rest of the actors was wasted.  Logan had no real storyline outside of Veronica, Wallace all but disappears for episodes at a time, and Weevil is hardly ever on-screen.  The utter waste of Jason Dohring (Logan) hurts the most, as Logan is transformed into the\\"boyfriend\\" character, and his sickle wit dies with his screen-time.  In the end, it's just too much Veronica and not enough everyone else, coupled with a dumb-downed version of a once very smart show.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|It was awsome and better than the first. Friends sticking together no matter what the problem is. Everyone trying something new.
B000LZ54FU|5.0|This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Black Sabbath album is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality remastered to perfection.   This  2007 Universal/Strange Days reissue is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging, great songs! A must have in any CD collector's library.
B00070DK1E|5.0|I really like the mix between electronic and acoustic instruments. There is a wide variety of dynamic ranges here. I think it was ahead of it's time as far as songwriting style and production goes. This record could be released anytime. This a nice album to listen to while working out, doing chores around the house, or taking a nice long drive.
B000P0I4O4|1.0|This film is extremly crappy. i thought that it would be good since it had Morgan Freeman in it and I haven't seen a film that he's been bad in yet, but this movie just proves that wrong. The movie is just really bad, it makes no sense,  there is no real action in it, and for the most part I really didn't understand it. It was poorly done. I can't believe Morgan Freeman was in a movie like this. the movie itself was probably about an hour and credits ran for maybe 30 minutes because it also seemed rather short. i would not waste money to buy this. you will be rather upset.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|I am a big fan of the Bourne movies. Seeing them in HD makes them even more enjoyable to watch. If you are Bourne fan you really need to check these movies out on HD-DVD. Can't wait for Ultimatum to come on HD-DVD.
B000R4SMD6|4.0|I would say this was a really good movie. I would recommend to watch. i don't know about buy though. It was kind of predictable if you actually look at all the clues , think about what's going on, and know something about law. Than it probably wont be as interesting in the end, but it was still a good movie.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is Madonna's work of art. And this CD is the very best collection of any music she has ever produced since \\"Erotica.\\" Madonna's lyrics are beautiful and strong because even after 9 years it still stands the test of time. It's completely impossible for this CD to be dated; with the electronica feel to it and fast moving dance numbers, such as the title-track this CD was way ahead of its time. Even in the double-00's \\"Ray of Light\\" is still very important as both a dance record and a record of reflection and interpersonal renewal.     Besides the song, \\"Ray of Light,\\" I also adore \\"Frozen.\\" This was the perfect song to be the lead-single because it mixed both the old and new Madonna into one. \\"Frozen\\" also helped resonate a steady flow of continuity.     I also love the song \\"Shanti/Ashtangi.\\" In this song Madonna sings a very pretty melody in Sanskrit that is both unique and uplifting. I don't know what she's saying but I do know that I want to keep listening. I wish she would have done an entire CD like this (although she did release a similar song, \\"Music's\\" B-side, \\"Cyberraga\\" in 2000.)     Some of the other truly magical tracks on this CD are: \\"Swim\\" \\"Skin\\" and \\"Sky Fits Heaven.\\" These songs are like pieces to an intricate quilt that come perfectly together. \\"Ray of Light\\" is almost like one big tune because all the songs on this CD live as one in perfect harmony.     Why is this CD so perfect? Because it mixes the old with the new. It includes a very young sound that still sounds familiar and welcoming. \\"Ray of Light\\" totally reminds me of Madonna's two other greatest masterpieces, \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Like A Prayer.\\"     This is the Madonna that I truly love because this CD was so unique and artistic. She took a huge gamble with \\"Ray of Light\\" because she hadn't had a hit record in years and boy did it pay off. You cannot deny \\"Ray of Light\\" its place in music history as one of the greatest popular dance records of the 90's.    A reporter in Europe once asked Madonna what she liked the most about the \\"old Madonna\\" and she said something to the effect of, \\"both the old Madonna and new Madonna have a sense of humor about these sort of questions.\\" I suppose she didn't want to spend her time talking about the \\"old Madonna.\\" Instead she was more interested in the present. And that's what \\"Ray of Light\\" is about. It's like a day at the beach with someone you love. It's a reminder that even after the dark there is some light. It's like a sunny day when everything turns out great. In this crazy world, \\"Ray of Light\\" gives me hope that there is still some optimism out there. You are home with \\"Ray of Light.\\"

B000PFU7OO|5.0|When you love a movie, you may be moved to buy the soundtrack for the good feelings it'll bring back, and with repetition you'll probably have several songs that become favorites.  But this was an amazingly different experience - we had never heard any of the music before we saw this movie, but we both had the same reaction to it - \\"We MUST get the soundtrack!\\"  True, we loved the movie, but it was the music that blew us away. Unless you're a hard core head banger, you're going to feel the same.    We were immediately fans of each very individual song, even though there are many types of music and moods represented - soft, loud, romantic, funny, rock, folk.  The stars of the movie, Glen Hansard (leader of the hot Irish group, The Frames) and Marketa Irglova (a young musician/songwriter from Prague), have wonderful chemistry together as musicians and as actors. I hope they continue to work together - it's to the music lover's advantage.

0671015206|4.0|\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" is an oldie but goodie. Although the market changes, some things about wealth builders stay the same. This book compares the attitudes and spending habits of those with \\"High Networth\\" i.e. the wealthy with the attitudes/habits of those with \\"High Consumption.\\"<br /><br />The basic message of the book is that High Networth Individuals work for their money/financial freedom by being frugal--i.e. spending wisely. Whereas High Consumption individuals--work for stuff and and an outwardly appearance of high status.<br /><br />The message is a good one--although after a couple hundred pages it becomes a bit redundant. Although, considering the outrageous spending habits and debt of Americans perhaps the redundancy is necessry.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This CD was even better than I expected. I had already heard that it was a great CD, from friends.  Gavin is an exceptional songwriter, and vocalist.  Hope to see more from him.

B00005JPLW|5.0|This is the best example of CGI, I've ever seen.  The historical interest of the film, is fascinating.  The way in which scenes are filmed are incredible.  Normally, 2 disc dvd's, are a waste of money.  This one isn't. The 2nd disc, is worth watching.
6304645635|2.0|Anytime a movie is made from a classic, the people who have no taste of their own but want to appear as if they do, praise the movie to the skies.      The fact is that at one-and-a-half hours, this could have been an okay, three-star movie.  At two-and-a-half hours, it is excruciating, like sitting through a sermon that drones on and on, making the same point over and over again.      In spite of the suggestion of grand houses, this gives every indication of being a very low-budget production: close-ups of the same few rooms, none of the sweep and pagentry of other period movies, minimal music, adequate but not great photography.  The location shots of the moors (few in number) are the visual highlight of this WGBH effort.      Bottom line: if you're still curious, talk your local library into getting it, then borrow it free.

0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins writes that persons of high intelligence are more likely to be atheists. If that be the case, then he's preaching to the choir with this book, basically a long sermon in support of atheism written at an above average level of reading difficulty. Not quite as in-your-face inflammatory as Hitchens' god is Not Great, The God Delusion reads like something out of a required reading list for a college-level course; however, the information is thought-provoking and the book itself is set up in an organized manner. Although it is classified as non-fiction, asterisks are scattered here and there, sometimes with anecdotes that give the feel that the author is having a (one-sided) conversation with the reader (Pp 92, 145, 211). Going so far as to explain the difference between the his two definitions of agnosticism (p 47), Temporary and Permanent (Agnosticism in Principle); providing a one (strong theist) to seven (strong atheist) scale of religiosity (p 50); and summarizing points made in certain chapters when especially confusing, as in Why There Certainly Is No God (p 156); he is \\"intrigued and mystified by the disproportionate privileging of religion in our otherwise secularized society [p 27].\\" Dawson attempts to dispel misconceptions about statements made by certain famous people, routinely used to \\"prove\\" that said people were theists; provides detailed examples about especially violent acts found in the bible; and tries to explain why religion: makes no sense; is unnecessary; and at times, is downright bad. But, as with most works on this subject, only fence sitters leaning towards atheism are likely to be converted solely through his words. A quote from a speech made by Douglas Adams (p 20) is apropos, \\"'Here is an idea or a notion that you are not allowed to say anything bad about; you're just not. Why not? Because you're not.'\\" Atheists will rejoice, agnostics will ponder, and theists will likely feel that the delusion is all his. The information included in the book is excellent; however, the presentation of it is excessively scholarly. Similarly interesting: god is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens and, (though an even tougher read) The Closing of the Western Mind by Charles Freeman.luded in the book is excellent; however, the presentation of it is excessively scholarly.

B00006RU5B|4.0|I am not going to bore you or try to make you believe I am some kind of musical genius or anything.    I just want to post the claim (with confidence I might add) that this is shaping up to be the best/signature album of the decade.  I know that there is still a couple of years left; but I am reasonably confident that Britney Spears or anyone out of American Idol are pretty much incapable of producing anything of greater impact than this.    Alls I can say, is that the world is somewhere in between \\"Can You Light my way?\\" and \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" these days...

0385486804|4.0|A lot of the posts here are actually judgments concerning the character, fate, and person of Christopher McCandless, rather than reviews of the book and what the author, Jon Krakauer, attempts and accomplishes in it.  Certainly, emotional reactions by readers are inevitable with a book such as this, but I prefer to reserve my feelings about Christopher McCandless and focus on the text, which I found to be alternately exhilarating and clunky.    Throughout much of Into the Wild, Krakauer writes with a fluid exuberance.  His sentence structures are compact and chunky, replete with grandiose adjectives and metaphors and an excitement for the subject that Krakauer is barely able to contain.  While the first half of the book reads like a chronicling and contextualizing of the travels of Christopher McCandless - the young man who spent two years roaming the western United States, northern Mexico, and finally concluding his travels in Alaska - the book is really about Krakauer himself.  It's clear that Krakauer feels a profound personal connection to McCandless.  McCandless' journey and feelings about nature, and man's place in it, largely mirror Krakauer's.  Thus, when he states in the author's note, \\"I won't claim to be an impartial biographer,\\" the reader should take him at his word.  On the back cover of the paperback edition, the publisher appropriately stamps Into the Wild a \\"Travel Essay\\" rather than straight \\"Nonfiction.\\"    While the book is easy and pleasing to read, it has an intricate structure that Krakauer is only partially successful in employing.  He uses flashbacks (excerpts from novels, wilderness tracts, and past true-life tragedies in the wild), flash-forwards (for example, the reader knows about McCandless' death at the beginning and finds out how he likely died at the end of the book), and flash-sideways (by \\"sideways\\" I mean interviews with McCandless' family and friends, the author's reflections, and other references to McCandless' contemporaries) -all of which map a circuitous route.  Mimicking a worldly traveler, the essay meanders and strays off course only to find itself again and continue on down the path.  Because it wanders, the essay isn't always consistent.  Krakauer's use of maps, for example, frustrated me because important stops along McCandless' journey aren't labeled.  Later in the book, Krakauer abandons providing maps altogether.  I find this ironic given the fact that McCandless' lack of a map contributed greatly to his death.    Because the book retraces paths and wanders into the wilds of the past, present, and future, there is a lot of repetition.  It's a strange kind of repetition: Krakauer gets sidetracked easily, and because his digressions are as rich as the main storyline, the reader forgets the main and becomes engrossed in tangents and tributaries.  And so Krakauer must repeat himself often.  If he had written a straightforward essay, the book would have been half as long, and it probably would have been less fun to read and less genuine.  Krakauer needs his readers to be as excited as he is about his subject, and to be willing to follow him and his sometimes schizophrenic and recursive style of writing.    I give Into the Wild high marks mostly because I found Jon Krakauer to be honest about his feelings regarding Christopher McCandless, the author's own time surviving the various wildernesses of his youth, his accurate and nuanced observations about the disposition and hormones that drive young men to take tremendous risks, and the intensity of his writing.  Whether or not you agree with Krakauer's assessment of McCandless - which is biased but not altogether unbalanced - I think most people will appreciate what he's written here.

B000000OR9|4.0|Blue Murder was the \\"solo\\" project Jon Sykes put together after he was summarily fired from Whitesnake by David Coverdale.  All of the guitar work on \\"Slide It In\\" and \\"Whitesnake\\" was done by Jon Sykes.  Prior to Whitesnake he was also in the final version of Thin Lizzy (\\"Thunder and Lightning\\") and in a band called Tygers of Pan Tang which was part of the NWOBHM along with Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Saxon, Girlschool, etc.    With that kind of pedigree, expectations should be high.  Jon put together a great band with Carmine Appice on drums and Tony Franklin (The Firm) on bass.  What they put out in 1990 was a hard rock epic in \\"Valley of The Kings\\" and a seemingly made for MTV blues ballad in \\"Jelly Roll\\".  The rest of it was not particularly memorable, but it wasn't crap either.  If you like \\"guitar rock\\", \\"classic rock\\", or even \\"hair bands\\" you'll probably like this.
B000MV9026|2.0|Overall, this movie was okay.  It didn't get even the least bit interesting until the final half of the movie.  Although not as bad as Surf's Up, I think it is not as good as some of the other animated movies.
B000NA77YO|4.0|I might be a rarity among fans of Black Sabbath, but I have no particular loyalty to any one era.  In fact, when I first started getting into heavier music, Ozzy had already left Black Sabbath.  Ronnie James Dio brought a new feeling to the band, and in my opinion the two studio albums he originally did with the band are some of their best work over the entire span of their existence.  However, for me the one glaring flaw is the omission of the studio version of Children of The Sea.    This compliation is great for anyone trying to learn the musical history of the Godfathers of Heavy Metal, or for anyone wanting a sample of some of Sabbath's best material.
B000F48CD8|5.0|As an unabashed Jack White (more specifically, White Stripes)superfan, I generally find it hard to criticize anything he does....Well, the same goes for this Raconteurs debut album. Clocking in at a mere 34 minutes, they are among the most enjoyable ever on a single CD....Broken Boy Soldiers is hard to categorize , as it covers many genres of popular music, including 70s inspired rock, blues, and contemporary pop....highlights include Level, by far the best song on the album - be sure to check out the video of this song on youtube - IMO the better version of this song, as well as Mr White's virtuoso work on the \\"Triple Jet\\"....honorable mention goes to the title track,a hauntingly melodic tune not soon forgotten....Two other great tracks include \\"Blue Veins\\" and the touching \\"Together\\"....Brendan Benson,the other Jack, Mr Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler, all longtime associates of Jack White's, contribute heartily to an incredible debut...    A few words about Jack White: I've been a fan of The White Stripes since the debut of Elephant in 2003. However, upon viewing some youtube clips and seeing them live at Madison Square Garden on 7/24/07, I now fully realize the brilliance of this guy...At my age, I often lament that I was too young to see Jimmy Page in his prime....I've seen video of Page, and in my opinion, history will recognize Jack White as a better performer,producer (Van Lear Rose et al), and, dare i write this, guitar innovator - don't take my word for it though....you folks on the west coast, Alaska,some other selected venues, and UK (where The Whites Stripes genius was uncovered by the legendary John Peel)still have the chance to see the Stripes live. Maybe,albeit unfortunately, for the last time ...the good news is that the Raconteurs are set to release their new rcording sometime in 2008, supported I'm sure by some tour dates...By the way,if by circumstance you are unable or unwilling to see the Stripes live, buy \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\", their authorized concert DVD - you wont believe your eyes what is captured on film...those of you who know the legend of Robert Johnson at the crossroads will think Mr White had made a similar deal...    That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.....
067003830X|5.0|If you're like me - a rank amateur in the field of brain science - you'll find that Dr. Doidge has authored an interesting and compelling text to explain the science of neuroplasticity.  More importantly, you'll discover the implications of the \\"new\\" discoveries that show that the human brain is malleable throughout our lifetime.    While I sometimes got lost in the details, Dr. Doidge provided enough easy to understand nuggets to allow me to grasp that the science of neuroplasticity has life altering applicability to all human beings. The text provides many stories of personal triumph that could be seen as unimaginable miracles to those who have no background in this exciting science. The stories have not only been useful in my own life, they have shown themselves to be useful to others as I share these exciting discoveries with friends who have children who struggle with similar stories as those depicted in the text.    I would not classify this text in the self-help genre. It is a detailed exploration of the brains ability to change itself and it prepares the reader with sufficient knowledge and encouragement to seek solutions that just a few years ago were thought to be the stuff of miracles.
0060899220|5.0|I first ran across Tony Bourdain as a guest judge on the hopelessly addictive Bravo show \\"Top Chef\\" then saw his excellent \\"No Reservations\\" show on the Travel Channel.  He looked like an interesting dude so I decided to check out his book to see what made him what he is. The book is a great read. The first half of the book was filled with stories on how he became a top chef. Crazy characters check in and out in every chapter. You learn what days NOT to eat fish. (Seriously you will think about this the next time you eat fish.) You will learn the life of a chef from the inside. I used to think I would like to be a chef. Not anymore. It is a very difficult life.  You will read about people who you will not forget. Interestingly the last chapter even foreshadows his future career path. The entire book reads like Tony is telling you stories over a couple of cold beers in a pub.  If you like food and you like wacky characters buy this book. Cheers!
B0000844IT|5.0|If you want Army of Darkness - this is the edition to get. It has it all: the director's cut and the theatrical cut (each with different endings). It also has the hilarious (and award winning) commentry with Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi - which is as funny as the film itself.    It would be nice if they had a later edition with the director's cut remastered, but until then this is a worthy purchase - and you won't regret it. This is one of my favorite movies, and I'm glad I have the choice of watching both versions since they are very different(I enjoy both).
0812550706|4.0|I really liked ender's Game, a lot. As with all book I read, there is a certain sense of skepticism involved. I asked the questions 'What is this Book about?' 'Where is it going?' and 'what does it have to offer me?' and with Ender all those questions were answered with positive results!    The book is about Ender Wiggin, it starts off when he is 6, only a child, a genius, and follows his progress through a training program as higher authoristies prepare him to command the war agains an alien race known as the buggers! The training program takes place in the 'Battle Room' a training room which is null G (no gravity) and teaches the soldiers to fend off attackes from all angles. Naturally Ender excells, but not without drawing enemies from all sides.    It is brillaint sci-fi, the characters and action and suspense are top notch, and only recieves a 4/5 because I spoilt the ending for myself coz I was thinking about it too much, only 3 pages before it was revealed... and the last chapter was a bit obscure to me, but overall deserves it place at the top.    Cheers!

B000PHX4VA|3.0|I guess I'm lucky as I got the Made In Singapore version which also came with a very nifty free Police tee-shirt which truth be told went a long way in my decision to get this yet another Police greatest hits compilation.  I was also impressed by the unique jewel case design and the cd booklet actually opens up into a poster which I thought was cool.<br /><br />Speaking as a fan from the very beginning though I can safely tell you that the tracks on this baby do not even remotely represent their best work.  I have been able over the years to filter their songs into what is truly The Police's 20 greatest songs and they are listed below:<br /><br />1. Roxanne<br />2. Can't Stand Losing You<br />3. Message In a Bottle<br />4. Walking On the Moon<br />5. Don't Stand So Close To Me<br />6. Driven To Tears (brilliant lyrics)<br />7. Canary In a Coalmine<br />8. De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da<br />9. Behind My Camel (Grammy award winner btw)<br />10.Spirits In the Material World<br />11.Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic<br />12.Invisible Sun<br />13.Omegaman (a masterpiece of guitaring excellence)<br />14.Secret Journey<br />15.Darkness (my all-time favourite Police track, simply a work of art)<br />16.Synchronicity II<br />17.Every Breath You Take<br />18.King of Pain<br />19.Wrapped Around Your Finger<br />20.Tea In the Sahara<br /><br />Thankfully with the advent of the MP3, I have been able to compile on my own what is truly the best work this great band has ever done.  If you already have all the albums save yourself the money and instead of getting this album, why don't you compile your own favourite tracks the way I did?
B000VECAEO|5.0|Season nine starts where we left off the previous season, with George recovering from injuries he took down a flight of stairs, thus interrupting the \\"Summer of George\\" he was planning to enjoy with  his generous severance check from the New York Yankees. George quickly finds another job, but his potential new boss has misunderstood his cane, and before George can explain the boss tells George about all of the benefits he will enjoy as a handicapped employee. George decides to go along with the ruse when he discovers he will have his own specially outfitted bathroom to suit his handicap - a perk George cannot resist.  When George is found out by his employer and even offered another generous severance package to leave, he decides to dig in and the whole situation turns into a humorous seige. George never fails to offend and infuriate people, so later in the season when an acquaintance is working on step nine of the AA program by going around and apologizing for past transgressions George is unhappy that he is never apologized to. He agitates the acquaintance about this so badly that he does eventually get the apology. However, unfortunately now the poor fellow has an anger management problem on top of his alcoholism due to George and must enroll in still another support group.<br /><br />Elaine is in a longer relationship than usual, continuing her romance with ace auto mechanic David Puddy. The mismatched couple have as tortured a relationship as you would expect and in the opening episode are bickering during a plane ride all the way back from Europe where they have been vacationing. They break up but end up sleeping together every time they see each other. This works out for Jerry and for Puddy since Jerry keeps betting Elaine that she can't stay away from Puddy - and winning - and it turns out that Puddy likes not having to stick around to cuddle with Elaine afterwards.<br /><br />Although I have no idea how Kramer manages to live in Manhattan without any visible means of support, at least we finally discover why he has been unemployed. He's been waiting for the strike to end at H&H Bagels for 12 years. The strike ends when the minimum wage finally reaches what the union demanded in the first place. Of course, Kramer is the only one of the strikers who has actually been faithfully striking all these years. When he decides to celebrate George's father's version of Christmas - Festivus - he wants the day off. When H&H refuses Kramer goes back on strike because his religious beliefs are not being honored, thus ending Kramer's brief venture into the world of work.<br /><br />Jerry has numerous romantic misadventures this season including a girlfriend that looks either beautiful or hideous depending on what the lighting is, another girlfriend who likes to wander around sans clothing yet still manages to annoy Jerry when he discovers there is such a thing as \\"bad naked\\", and yet another girlfriend whom Jerry throws over for the sound of his own voice imitating the noises that the girl's stomach makes.<br /><br />This year has Newman making quite a few appearances, most notably in \\"The Butter Shave\\" where he discovers that he is strangely attracted to Kramer in a culinary way after Kramer uses butter as a tanning lotion and then falls asleep in the sun. That all-over butter smell is just too much for Newman to resist ending in a hilarious chase scene through the middle of Jerry's stand-up routine. Newman and Kramer are also featured in a satire of the X-Files when Kramer starts to complain about his junk mail to the post office and goes there to declare he no longer wants his mail delivered.<br /><br />The last four episodes - Puerto Rican Day, the two clip shows, and the finale were a bit of a let-down to me. Puerto Rican Day didn't seem to have the same level of ensemble humor I was accustomed to seeing, the clip shows are just bits and pieces taken from prior shows that were shown on the night the finale was broadcast, and thefinale just didn't live up to my expectations. But then it would be hard to wrap up in one hour a show that spent nine years focused on the minutia of life as experienced by four self-involved people and somehow managed to never disappoint.

B000EZ88FK|4.0|I have heard many, many cds over the course of my almost 4 decades as a fan of music and I have to say that this is the best cd I've ever heard with regards the quality of the sound: Awesome! is all I can say about the remastering job that our friends from Japan have done on this baby!  I used to have this album on cassette many years ago but listening to this now is like listening to a different album.  This is by far the best version of this album this is currently out there by a mile.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is the way the mlps is put together. Having an insert that has all the lyrics in both English and Japanese is nice but the quality of the cardboard used is thin and poor unlike some of the better designs that I've seen that is out there. To get an idea of how good mlps designs can get, just take a look at the mlps releases of any of the Hall & Oates albums or the Sly and the Family Stone \\"Greatest Hits\\" or the Patti Smith \\"Horses\\" albums and you'll see what I mean about this version looking cheap and shoddy in comparison.<br /><br />Still, content-wise, this is still that brilliant breakthrough album that we know and love and with brilliant remastering makes this still come highly recommended.
B000TYWAUA|2.0|Several years ago I bought[[ASIN:055338368X Gates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae]] This book was history in a real way, and it was most enjoyable to learn about the Spartan life. And then to read of the planning for the battle, its execution and results. Wonderful!    Now, out comes a DVD named '300' which is so off the mark, so Hollywood and so unbelieveable that I would not buy it again or reccomend it to anyone. The DVD does insult to the Spartans who fought the Persians and in doing so, preserved democracy.
B000GALF7G|4.0|Gino Vannelli has always been one of my favourite singer-songwriters and he must be along with Rupert Holmes among the best ever Canadian contributors to pop music.  Gino was one of the first to use the synthesiser predominantly in his music and this album represents among the best of his works.  The complexity of tracks from the intricate rhythms fused with jazz stylings reminds me a lot of the work of Steely Dan although Gino's sound is unique to him alone.<br /><br />My favourite track is the AOR hit \\"I Just Wanna Stop\\" but all the tracks from \\"Appaloosa\\" to \\"People I Belong To\\" make for compelling listening and do not represent filler even remotely.  The sound quality of this remastered version of the album is also very, very good.  The only gripe I have is the way the mlps is put together. Having an insert that has all the lyrics in both English and Japanese is nice but the quality of the cardboard used is thin and poor unlike some of the better designs that I've seen that is out there. To get an idea of how good mlps designs can get, just take a look at the mlps releases of any of the Hall & Oates albums or the Sly and the Family Stone \\"Greatest Hits\\" or the Patti Smith \\"Horses\\" albums and you'll see what I mean about this version looking cheap and shoddy in comparison.<br /><br />Still, you would be hard pressed to find a better sounding remaster of this album and so at least for now, this is the best version of Gino's best known and perhaps best ever album that is currently out there.<br /><br />Recommended.
0446614459|3.0|I enjoy increasing my vocabulary as I read. This book didn't challenge me in that aspect. I like following plots, deciphering clue, guessing the ending. Baldacci drops enough hints yet the ending seems believable only if one is as demented as the arch villain. The story maintains a high level of suspense throughout. At times the agents follow dead ends or scant clues but that is life in the FBI and Secret Service at times. Baldacci uses too much dialog which doesn't develop enough depth for some of the characters. Overall, a good choice if you want an exciting read where you don't need to engage your brain. Just enjoy the plot, don't try to figure it out.
B000GG4ZSG|4.0|Lou Reed's influence on rock music cannot be overestimated.  Whether it's his work with the Velvet Underground or his solo work, Reed has been influencing giants in the music world and will probably continue to do so for decades to come.  This is by far Reed's best solo album and indeed, to call this an album of all his greatest tracks wouldn't be too far off.  No filler or weak tracks on this baby.  My favourite track is \\"Perfect Day\\"; you can almost feel the heartache and despair in Reed's voice when he sings the sarcastic lyrics making this one of my all time favourite songs.  It never fails to move me whenever I listen to it.<br /><br />This version of the album includes a 16-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and the sound quality has been very well remastered for an excellent sound quality.  The only gripe I have about this is the way the mlps is put together. The quality of the cardboard used is thin and poor unlike some of the better designs that I've seen that is out there. To get an idea of how good mlps designs can get, just take a look at the mlps releases of any of the Hall & Oates albums or the Sly and the Family Stone \\"Greatest Hits\\" or the Patti Smith \\"Horses\\" albums and you'll see what I mean about this version looking cheap and shoddy in comparison.<br /><br />Still, sound-wise, this is probably the best version of the album that is out there and if you don't mind the quality or rather lack of quality of the sleeve design then this is a good buy.
B000N6U0E2|2.0|The title of this film is a total misnomer, since the character played by Will Smith is committed from the beginning to ruining what few chances for happiness in life he already had - a wife and young son. He loses his wife, who is simply being sensible and giving up on a husband who obviously cannot do anything right. Living from hand to mouth as he does, from whence did he figure out that the only job he could contemplate (aside from selling worthless pseudo-x-ray machines to uninterested doctors) was at Dean Witter? What on earth gave him the idea, as he stood before the Dean Witter building and watched the minions of Witter exiting to the street, that stock brokers are a happy-go-lucky bunch of people? What he puts his young son through probably traumatized him for life - his mother abandons him, he loses all his belongings, he has to sleep in public restrooms and in homeless shelters. And all just so dear old dad can have his dream of being a pinchey stock broker.    Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't buy it. The happy ending - which was a total given - failed utterly to wash the nasty taste of the foregoing 100 minutes out of my mind. This film is \\"based on a true story\\" but rings every false note imaginable.
B00074C6DS|1.0|It's a crying shame when one of the great classics of 70's rock is treated so shabbily like this.  This mlps version should really have been an improvement over the previous releases; instead, we get poor quality cardboard shoddily put together albeit with an insert containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  There are 6 bonus tracks of alternative versions of the main tracks but what's the point when the sound quality is so very desperately poor?  If you are going to pay so much more for an album to get you to \\"upgrade\\" from your present copy, I'd demand a much better product that what we have here.  I guess I could forgive the sub-standand mini-lp replica sleeve design but I definitely cannot forgive the very poor sound quality for the kind of price these guys are asking for.  My advice is to wait for a much better remastered version to come out and to give this one a wide berth.<br /><br />Content-wise, these tracks represent some of the best work ever done from the early 70s.  When you have both Paul McCartney and George Harrison taking an interest in your work let alone Todd Rundgren producing as well, it's safe to say that you're on to something big and that's exactly what this album represents.  From the brilliant slide guitar work of Harrison on my favourite album track \\"Day After Day\\" to the soulful and beautiful opening track \\"Take It All\\" you get track after track of simply good songwriting.  No fillers on this baby at all and it still sounds as enjoyable today as it did all those years ago.<br /><br />Let's hope the powers that be get their act together and head back to the drawing board to bring us an mlps version that is worthy of the album.  I wait with bated breath....

B0009P42S2|4.0|As far as Anime goes, Katsuhiro Ôtomo is a heavy hitter.  This movie is not as grand and ambitions as anything he's done that I've seen, ok I'm comparing it to Akira.  I enjoyed Steam boy, the story was fun and very interesting and the setting (1866 England) was very well done and added a certain depth and intrigue to the storyline and characters.  I think this film does't have the \\"teeth\\" that Akira did but I'm not sure it need them or is trying to be that.  This film is not depressing or sinical but up lifting and spited.  Like many Amine's of recent memory the plot is very evolved and looses you in points of the film.  All in all you know what's going on most of the time.  This film has its flaws and some annoying character with some pacing problems. The action lags on at times but it's a good little movie for anime fans.  Is it Spirited away or Princess Monake (sp?) not at all but it's good to see Otomo back in the saddle.
0316067598|5.0|It was four men against 100 plus Taliban supporters, but the mission was to take out the terrorist responsible for inventing the IEDs that have claimed the lives of thousands of Americans and our allies.  He was well protected, or was he?<br /><br />I heard about this book on christian radio one day as I drove to work.  I listen mostly to the songs and sometimes I tune out in the mornings when they mostly talk which was what they were doing the morning they were interviewing Marcus Luttrell who was one of the 4 Navy Seals involved in this mission upon the mountain, but this time I kept the radio going.  Wow, what a story, I thought, and boy did I want to read it.  The book was hard to get from the public library because all the copies were checked out.  So, I finally got a copy and it was another personal reading record for me.  This book was very hard to put down.<br /><br />You don't get to this story until the last half of the book, only after you can understand the training and sacrifice that the men go through that become SEALS.  And after learning the week of hell Marcus lived through in and around the mountain at the Afghani border to Pakistan, can you begin to understand the hell week the SEALS must go through before they pass muster.  The SEALS were told to get wet and sandy during boot camp, never to get dry and smelly like they got in Afghanistan.  I recently asked an army officer who was off duty temporarily and had been sent to Afghanistan what it was like over there.  One of his first replies was that it was smelly.  He didn't explain why, just that he'd been to a lot more interesting places in his 10 plus years of service.  No doubt he must have accidentally stumbled into the communal latrines or open pits that are directly adjacent to their dwelling places that Marcus had the misfortune of falling into.  I laughed at what Marcus told one of his instructors, who came to see him when he was first rescued.  His instructor who had no doubt screamed and shot fake bullets at him during hell week, asked him what he could do for him.  That whatever he wanted, or needed, he would do it for him.  Marcus replied \\"I want a cheeseburger\\", and then started sobbing for the first time since his friends were killed.  (I've backpacked before in a strange country for 2 weeks and afterwards was craving the taste of a regular coca cola, not diet like I usually get.  So I could kind of relate.)  It's superhuman though what those guys achieve and put themselves through, seems they give it 2000 per cent.<br /><br />Marcus explains also in the book how close the SEALS work as a team and how close the men get as a result.  Of course, that amplifies a thousandfold the hurt and loss they feel when their buddies die on the field.  This book I just can't recommend enough.  It will make you want to exercise, love your country, love the guys who are fighting the terrorists who attacked us and who still want to hurt us, love our troops, and make you appreciate President Bush for his love of our troops and how he sincerely wants to defend our country from lawless attackers.  I can't believe I just said that, but I mean every word of it.  I've never been a Bush fan, but lately the Democrats have been greatly disappointing me.  But I'll have to save that ammo for another review...<br /><br />The story of the villagers protecting Marcus made me really begin to understand the Afghanis' predicament.  They're muslim and their village gets overrun by these Taliban thugs who know perfectly well the terrain there is a great hideout.  Poor Afghanis.  Imagine how they live their, on average, 43 years of existence.  \\"Taliban, taliban, run Marcus\\".  How could he, if you understand how shot up he was.  Or it could be,  \\"The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming, run comrade, run\\", 30 years ago having many of their limbs blown off their bodies.<br /><br />I have to say that being a christian and reading this true story is inspirational in that it seemsthat G-d was at work in this messy situation as Marcus and the other SEALS practically jumped off the mountain dodging the sudden onslaught of RPGs, and AK47's from the Taliban.  His rifle stayed with him the whole time, and the protection the Afghanis gave him was miraculous in so many ways, and all that time he was presumed dead by his family, people were at his home, praying for him, for many, many days.  \\"Hands lifted up\\", I've told you before in another review, \\"smash more battalions than hands that strike\\".  (Patton quoting Bosuet).<br /><br />Great book for a book club, my sister's thinking of getting her book club to read this.  It's really, really good stuff.<br /><br />Yes, Marcus, \\"G-d bless Texas\\"!situation as Marcus and the other SEALS practically jumped off the mountain dodging the sudden onslaught of RPGs, and AK47's from the Taliban.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|... maybe the fake trailers aren't listed as special features because the production company considers them part of the movie? I remember Tarantino and Rodriguez being sooo excited about the fake trailers before the movie came out. And at least in my theater, the trailers had as much impact on the audience as the full features. I'd be shocked if they weren't included.    And if they ARE included, what's the problem with buying the movies separately and watching them back to back? You'll have to get up off your couch once, which may be an effort for some of you, but I'd imagine the quality of the picture would suffer if they put the entire 4-hour experience (with extended footage) on one disc anyways. Sure, this is going to cost we the consumers more in the long run, but considering the movie bombed in theaters we shouldn't be surprised they're doing it this way.    Having said that, if the rumors are true and the fake trailers aren't included, I'm down with the boycott - everyone knows a version with the fake trailers will be released eventually.

0345347951|5.0|Does this book remind you of anything?  As a huge fan of Clive Staples Lewis, and a Christian, it does remind me of many Biblical teachings:  Powers and Principalities as part of God's plan for humanity for one. We are told that God so loved the world that through His Son we are commanded not to be just nice, but new persons- this was expressed and illustrated by Lewis in many places in his oeuvre.    In the book by CSL, _Beyond Personality_, the final chapter in this book is \\"The New Men\\".  Lewis used the evolutionary idea of the \\"Next Step: in a Christian sense to mean the change that God's creature undergo to become part of the family of God.  It seems to me that Clarke has described in this fictional sci-fi Childhood's End a way in which to look at how this change may occur. In Clarke's book the Overmind is silent and unknowable, while the Christian is brought to life in God through His Son Jesus Christ who is fully God and fully man.    In the C. S. Lewis Reader's Encyclopedia Ed. Jeffrey D. Schultz and John G. West, Jr., under the heading Arthur C. Clarke is this quote from Clarke: \\"I only met Lewis once, but I had an extensive correspondence with him, which is now in the Bodleian Library.  And I used to see Joy Greesham almost every week.\\"  The two authors' books, Clarke's Chaldhood's End and Lewis' Perelandra came out about the same time.  One must also read Lewis' Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.  But it is the Malacandrian utopia in Lewis' Perelandra which resonates most with Childhood's End.  Childhood End, like Perelandra and Lewis' Out of the Silent Planet, are must reads for all who would think on what it is that humanity is ultimately destined for.  Clarke and Lewis disagreed on theology, but they both had vision that this world on Earth may not be the not be humankind's last dwelling place.
B000EQH2QK|3.0|After putting out many albums, one would hope that an artist would grow and become better at their art. Well, don't look here for that. There were a few OK songs, one or two good songs, and that's it. The remainder of this album was boring beyond compare, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This CD is great if you are a real Neil Young fan.  This will bring back a lot of memories of the past. This CD shows that he is still number one and that his music is just as strong as it was back then.  It was strange watching this because I went to see him in Chicago in 1971. I loved this CD and so will you.  You will not be disappointed.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|First, let me say that the review by the Amazon reviewer is absolutely embarrassing and he is clueless about what this album should and should not be.  He should be banned from any more reviews. How in the world can this guy think that this musical effort is lacking because it is missing Motley Crue type rock anthems?  The lyrics and subject matter are intense and require a mature approach to telling the story through songs that should NOT be wrapped in the party hardy Crue style.  And to call the songs \\"pop\\" is ridiculous.  N'Sync is \\"pop\\"; Kelly Clarkson is \\"pop\\"; Yellowcard is \\"pop\\" rock, this music is anything but \\"pop\\". What you have are songs that are raw, intense and creatively different than anything Nikki Sixx has done.  From acoustic, to rock, to anthem choruses to circus type music, to an altered Christmas Carol, to voice overs used to tell the story and build the music's intensity, the songs ride the wave of musical styles.  And yet all these styles end up in a cohesive flow that tells the story of Sixx's heroin struggles.     I am not a Crue fan, so I was stunned at the musical depth of this album.  I bought the cd at the urging of friends who were raving about it.  I urge anyone who is looking for something great in lyric content, strong song writing and great singing in the current mundane music environment to pick up a copy.  These three guys deserve any award that may come their way over the next year for a great recording effort and the financial benefits they rightly deserve.  After this effort, I am not sure how Nikki Sixx can go back to playing songs like \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" when he has shown there is so much more musically he can offer the public.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This film is known for two things - the most violent rape ever shown on film and for its world-class cinematography. I had a hard time watching it myself - but the second time through I was able to look past the horrific rape, and retribution scene to consider the emotional and artistic aspects which are vast. I have been working with women concerned about domestic violence. A certain group of counselors should watch this filim - because it shows better than anything I have seen how truly evil rape is.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I am never in a rush to watch movies so i tend to wait for most of the films i wish to see on blu-ray for the extra picture and audio quality for a better veiwing experience.  As expected on blu-ray all round quality was very good both picture and audio, and as for the film itself i thought was excellent with a great story line and lots of cool action with big battle scenes and lots of slow-mow matrix stlye action.  It places numbers into perspective, showing 300 elite trained spartans \\"best of the best\\" battling with thousands and thousands of persians.  Lots of blood spashing everywhere, lots of clever tactics 300 men working as an immense force!  Ok this will give you a taste of what your in for, enjoy and look out for the \\"WALL\\" you will know what i mean when you watch it!
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Looking at all of the reviews its easy to tell this album has gotten mixed reviews, either you love it or hate it it appears. Im sorta somewhere in the middle. A few of the tracks are my most favorite pumpkin songs ever such as tarantula, thats the way, united states (pretty bad ass track sorta sounds like tool)and others are just skippable or best as background music. Nothing really is awful on here but other than those mentioned tracks to me nothing truly stands out like wow this is freaking awesome like siamese dream did when you first heard that album or like melon collie did. Maybe its me as well but the vocal production on here sounds really bad. I dont know how to explain but it doesnt sound like past albums and they have Billy too loud or something. I know that really doesnt help explain what I mean. To close overall if your a diehard pumpkins fan that has liked all of their albums and not just the above mentioned classics you might want to check this out as I said in the title it is a solid album but otherwise you might just want to download above mentioned tracks and sample some of the others. I hope they release another classic album in the future and they dont close out a wonderful career with this.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|It's a crying shame more people didn't see this flick in the theaters. It is still one of my top 5 movies of the year. Who would have thought Markie Mark would turn into an acting powerhouse.
B000003TA4|4.0|This is not the greatest album ever made, and Kurt Cobain is not the greatest songwriter ever.  However, this is a very good album, one that I can still listen to.  It may be technically \\"grunge\\", but to me it's just damn good music.  Cobain was one of the few Gen Xers who was a real artist.  This album has many great songs, including Smells like Teen Spirit, Lithium, Come as You Are, and Breed (which is underrated in my opinion).  In Utero is Nirvana's (and Kurt's) masterpiece, but this is still good.  Those trashing Cobain are mistaken, but those who act like this album is the Gen X equivalent of Sgt. Pepper are sadly mistaken.  So, chill out on this thread, and realise that Kurt was a great artist and musician and should be respected, but he isn't akin to God (and he would probably have said that himself)...

It exists close to Washington, D.C., has no power as such. The goal of the members is to find the \\"truth\\" behind their country's actions.    The aging leader of the group has no known past (recorded that is) and has taken the name \\"Oliver Stone.\\" Day and night this group of four study wild conspiracy theories, current events and the machinations of the government of the day, hoping to discover  some truth that will hold America's politicians accountable to its citizens and after witnessing a shocking murder the Club is drawn headfirst into a  plot that threatens the very security of the nation . . .    In the Camel Club the author paints a picture of the world that could be all too true in the future, with a few powerful people having the opportunity to stop the chaos.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is one of the best action movies in the last few years.  The fact that its a farce only makes it the better.
0375505091|2.0|... no more no less.  Do not expect to see more than an \\"allowed invasion\\" on her life in B&W.  Self promotion, just it. But who didn't, right?  If you can take some lessons \\"through her personal eyes\\", good for you.   I believe from everything you can take something good.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|This is a comedy, well directed by Ridley Scott, and well acted by Russell Crowe and Marion Cotillard, which brings a quiet pleasure to the viewer. The whole cast is truly superb and the ambience of the French Provence is beautiful.  LIke a fine glass of wine.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I knew when i saw this film in theatres that i had to have it on HD-DVD or Blu-Ray DVD.  Looks great, the blue/green screen and extras were actually worth taking the time to watch.  Just wish i had more time to explore the HD-DVD.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This is my second set of these headphones. I had the fist set over two years but some fluid got into one of the ear pieces so I purchased another set. I use these all the time while exercising at the gym. I like the fact that they never fall out of your ear like individual earbuds do from time to time if you work up a good sweat.
0790733226|5.0|This is a very well made film.  It is one of my favorites of all time!
B000QQFKYE|1.0|.........and produce another film like this one. As usual, you think you are following along with the film (despite the rabbits in the room scene) and, all of a sudden, it degenerates in a long winded, confusing, boring series of unrelated and unconnected drivel.  The movie was billed as a horror in the International Film Festival I saw it in. The only horror part in the movie was when I suddenly had this scary thought that it would never end.  I should have been warned off when I saw the 2 clues \\"David Lynch\\" and \\"Surreal\\" but no, I thought, \\"nothing could be as bad as Mulholland Drive\\"  One could make better use of 3 hours by staring blankly at nothing.
B000255LIY|5.0|I have long been a fan of the original version with Katherine Hepburn but I am sorry to say that Glen Close is amazing in the role.  She is rivoting on the screen.  Strongly recommend!
B000PMGS8G|4.0|I just end watching the film and it totally transported myself to my childhood back on 1980 when I was a 7 years old kid. I Know this movie is kind of cheesy and has this theatrical, over-acted old-style movie look. But it is very entertaining, so much fun to see and you don't get bored at any moment. The lines are so golden-age comic-styled and the production design is totally based on the 1930's original art concepts.  Its a must have movie for the fans.   Positive points: You can have the pic now. The quality is acceptable. You can watch the first 1936's Flash Gordon chapter, totally new for me! The packaging is so collective and deluxe. Its always nice to hear Queen's soundtrack.  Negative points: Some errors in lipsynch. A booklet would have been nice.    In general terms:  am so happy with this product. I recommend it if you watched this film as a child and now you want to enjoy some time feeling the way you felt back in 1980.
B000K7VHLY|4.0|I hadn't watched since the 90's. Forgot how the movie started off. Once it gets goin, this is an interesting if not completely over the top rendition of the Bard's classic.<br />The music edition's extras were mostly lost on me, but one of these days I'll give them a watch.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is a very well made film. It is one of my favorites.  Anyone with an interest in Ham Radio needs to see this. It is like a very well written  Twilight Zone.
B000VASG3M|4.0|This Blu-Ray version of [[ASIN:B000VAPZM2 \\"High School Musical 2\\"]] is a widescreen (1.78:1) presentation of the TV-movie, with 5.1 48 kHz, 24-bit uncompressed audio.<br /><br /> Like on the standard DVD, an additional music scene has been integrated into the film: the musical number Troy and Sharpay rehearse. The scene features Sharpay playing a pineapple princess looking for her \\"fresh fish prince\\" in the Polynesian fantasy  \\"Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a.\\" The bonus features will be identical to the standard DVD: a sing-along feature, rehearsal footage and music videos.<br /><br />As for the film itself, this sequel to [[ASIN:B000F2BNW2 \\"High School Musical\\"]] features the same stars and nearly the same plot. Once again, high school hunk Troy (Zac Efron) ponders whether he should stick to the stuff he knows (in this case, the sweet Gabriella), the conniving Sharpay wants him there beside her, and eventually everyone learns that they're all in this together. If you loved the first movie you'd like this one -- it has the same feel-good bounce -- but I bet you won't be watching it as often.<br /><br />So why four stars? The music. It's better, and sounds fantastic in this Blu-ray release. \\"You Are The Music In Me\\" is a catchy duet by Gabriella and Troy (Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron) that uses a gospel chorus to rise above nearly everything cranked out by today's dime-a-dozen pop tarts. \\"Everyday\\" (also Gabriella and Troy) is in the same vein, an early-Britney bouncer with a finale straight out of a black church. \\"I Don't Dance\\" boogies along like an old big-band number with choreography inspired from [[ASIN:B00008972S West Side Story]], while the staccato boy-band rocker \\"Bet On It\\" (Troy) recalls the best of Michael Jackson. Finally, \\"All for One\\" is a hand-clapping, surf-guitar shout-out that hints, a little, at Sheryl Crow's \\"Soak in the Sun.\\"
B000NDIAWY|4.0|I had never listened to Brandi Carlile before seeing her open for the Indigo Girls in Seattle. I highly recommend her--- she's quite talented with a rock/occassionally folksy tone.
B000002LAC|5.0|When these ladies bring their prodigious talents together, the result is nothing short of an extraordinary experience.  Each brings her own brand of musical expression, which is quite different from those of the others; one would think that they would have to stay separate -- au contraire!!  What a treat is this offering - that really cannot be copycatted (pardon the pun).  I heartily recommend this for anyone who likes the country and bluegrass and western and country-western varieties of music.
0385720920|3.0|This is the first book I have read by this author. He defintiely knows how to make an impact.  I enjoyed the book but found it to be too contrived.  The author seems to written this book by first coming up with the moral of the story (which he clearly states just so you will not miss it) and then in order to prove the moral, populated the story with an odd assortment of emotional train wrecks engaging in a series of odd (in some cases very odd)  obsessive complusive behaviors.  Victor Mancini the main character is one such emotional train wreck, derailed (in true Freudian fashion) by his mother.  He wants to be good and wants to be bad.  He wants to fit in and does not. He hates his childhood and yet wants to understand more about it.  And all the past events (whether real or imaginary) are the direct influence on his present actions, either conciously or unconciously.  Victor's enablers and counselors in this story are those he meets in his mother's nursing home and a variety of sex addicts (some from group meetings and some not) and those heroes created by Victor by saving Victor from \\"choking\\" at a variety of restaurants.  The \\"choking\\" is, of course, a scam carried out by Victor for money, love, attention and control. These conflicts and schemes  come to a head in an outrageous ending and Mr. Palahniuk does get his point across.  The reason why this book gets three stars is because while I thought about this book afterwards, trying to decipher its bits and parts, I did not enjoy its execution.  I did not find it funny so much as clever and at times a bit too clever for my liking. I do not want to say  more about the plot because there are some nice plot twists.  Suffice it to say, if you liked the movie \\"Fight Club\\", then this book is worth reading.  If you did not, then do not bother.  I have no doubt I will read another of Mr. Palahniuk's books (not immediately however), but I cannot fully recommend this book unless you are a fan.
B000N3ST8O|4.0|The CD is good for Stevie's own music. And it is worth what I paid here. She can write and sing with the best of them. But honestly I like Fleetwood mac and both of them together.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|This movie is 2.5 hours...but I was glued to the story TOTALLY from beginning to end!  This is the best movie of the year (as of August 2007) as far as I'm concerned!    But the DVD Sucks!  There are no extras, no commentaries, no documentaries.  This is the reason why I don't buy movies anymore, I rent them.    Last time I got burned was when I bought Sin City...and the extended version came out 3 months later!  Had I known, I would've waited.    The only DVD's I buy now are TV series...the movies I rent.  If, after renting it, I decide I want a copy I will wait awhile before purchasing to see if a better version comes out.    This technique doesn't always work though:  I bought Passion of the Christ in 2004...a better version was released over 2 years later.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great movie.  I never got into the series on TV because I never heard about it but my brother told me to watch this movie and I am hooked.  The writing is fantastic and the chemistry between all of the characters is so comfortable that you really care about everyone of them.  Funny, exciting, just plain fun to watch. Even if you aren't a big Science Fiction fan you will love this movie.  WATCH IT!
0743277457|5.0|This book was uniquely both inspiring and enlightening. I am an avid chess player as well as a former professional martial artist. So this book was simply stunning for me!
0593047974|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. I finished it in a day because I couldn't put it down. I own the hardcover and when I finished it I bought all of Dennis Lehane's other books and was equally impressed. This guy has talent.
0743496728|5.0|I remember being a high school student and not being in the popular clique. I was not treated like Peter but it still hurt to be an outsider.     Peter is not just an outsider, he is a constant victim of pranks, insults, punches, shoves, etc. The fact that he did not go on this shooting spree earlier is the amazing part. The part that angered me is that during these years, nobody tried to help Peter. Not one teacher, helped him. Mr. McCabe, the math teacher, tried to connect with him and help him. However, it almost seemed like it was too late to help Peter.     Every school in the US has a zero tolerance policy against violence. This started after Columbine. However, Sterling High School had this policy and athletes and other popular students got away with such bad behavior. The thought of having to endure the torture that Peter had to go through really upset me. While this is a fictional story, Jodi Picoult wrote it so well that it grated against my nerve endings. This book is realistic.     There are a few surprises that are revealed that I am not going to mention.     Lacy Houghton (Peter's mom) babied him and always pitted him against his brother. Peter could never be as \\"perfect\\" as his older brother, Joey. She embarrassed him by giving him a Superman binder when he is in the 6th grade. She also tried to toughen him up by saying that she would punish him if he did not stand up for himself. The punishment was no playing with Josie Cormier for a month.    The characters intertwine but you will discover this while reading the book. Lacy and Alex Cormier (mother of Josie and Judge) were actually friends. Lacy helped to deliver Alex's baby. Josie and Peter used to be best friends. She would rescue Peter all the time from bullies. He never learned to stand up for himself. After an incident with a rifle that was in Lacy's basement, the two children were never allowed to play with one another. This started the dominoes falling. Peter missed her. Josie went on to become friendly with the popular kids. She felt that she was fake and that if they discover who she really is that they won't like her. She goes along with the cruel jokes that they pulled on Peter. Things never revert back to the prior days of friendship.     As Josie said, \\"Popular kids don't make friends, they make alliances.\\" This is so true because they need one another to make themselves feel good. They cannot be popular without any person and to pick on someone else. She let her so called \\"boyfriend\\" treat her like dirt. He hit her and broke her leg but she stuck with him because he said he loved her.     I love how this novel makes you question everything you think about acts of violence. This is not a feel good novel but a thought provoking one. Who made this child this way, his parents or the bullies or both? How do you teach children to stand up to bullies? How do you make it right for them when they are the outsiders and you are just a parent? It happens to all children at some point in their lives. It is almost like a rite of passage. Children can be so cruel. However, when does it go too far? How is it dealt with by adults? At one point, does the child assume responsiblity for his actions? Bullying and cliques are cyclical; every generation goes through these experiences. This is one message that Picoult is trying to convey.    This is my first novel of hers that I have read. It will not be my last! I am going to read some of her previous novels. I love her style!
B00009P1MP|5.0|Soeur Souris posted that this cannot be ripped \\"for fair use\\". Not so, at least with the disk I received. I made a great backup with Exact Audio Copy (Windows OS), converted the .wav files to .flac, and they play just fine anywhere I can play .flac files. I also burned the ripped .wav files to a cd (using EAC with a .cue sheet), getting a copy that is an exact duplicate of the original. It plays flawlessly on every cd player I have (in a car, three computers, home stereo and a Sony Discman). I doubt one needs EAC to accomplish this - EAC isn't designed to get around Sony's scheme; I used it solely because I am familiar with it, and it is great for making lossless (and lossy) compressed audio files.  I suspect rather that Soeur had a hardware/software issue that has nothing to do with this disc.<br /><br />My advice: don't give credence to his statement, at least for the product shipping nowadays, though he certainly has my sympathy.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Then this movie is definitely for you. It's been one of my all time favorites since I was a child. I've seen it countless times over the last 15 years and each time is just as funny and entertaining as the first time.
B000QXDED6|4.0|Gerald Butler was the RIGHT choice for the lead role. The actor who portrayed Xerxes (sic) was too feminine, and that voice was ridiculous.     I enjoyed the acting, none the less. The imagery was great, the effects were a lot of fun. The action was a sight to behold.     I never did read the graphic novels, but did not feel \\"out of the loop\\" or at a loss for what was happening in the movie with out that.     This movie was purchased for my 18 year old son, who, I watched the movie in the theater with. He really loved it, and I bought it for him as a Birthday present.
074356619X|5.0|Fantastic, makes sense, life changing. A must read if you want to improve your life.
0670034711|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert writes extraordinarily well, and it is so easy to be with her in the places she describes and into the people she writes about.  It is a vacation in and of itself without ever having to leave home.
B000H5U832|5.0|A wonderful movie for the whole family. A great movie to put in to calm and quiet little boys with....
630469654X|5.0|From the director of \\"The Omen\\" and \\"Superman: The Movie,\\" Richard Donner crafts a tale of lavish fantasy and true romance in medieval France (never named as such, but the name of \\"The Mouse\\" and several other characters make it clear that the story is set in France). Teen idol Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer (in a rare appearance as a good guy) and the always lovely Michelle Pfeiffer star in this expertly written fantasy from a story by Edward Khmara (who also co-wrote the script with Michael Thomas and Tom Mankewicz, who also served as consultant on this film and<br />\\"Superman: The Movie\\"). The music in the opening credits is amazing. I've always been a huge fan of period/fantasy films, plus the all-star cast (which includes Tony winner John Wood) and director (Donner) intrigued me to see it. Made in the same decade as the so-so \\"Labyrinth\\" (the story needed more work) and the even better fantasy-adventure-romance-comedy<br />\\"The Princess Bride,\\" the film uses synthesized musical pieces which clash with the period setting, but it is no matter. In fact, the music makes the film even more enjoyable. Great job from everyone involved. My only minor complaint is that the climactic sword fight could have been better choreographed. Minor, but worth noting. Rated PG for some violence.
B000P0J024|5.0|I have been searching used book/music stores for several years trying to find this CD!  Mine went missing soon after I bought it in the late 80's.  Happy to have this great music back in my library!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Even though Firefly didn't get to finish its first season, the fan base was large enough for a movie to be made. Firefly and Serenity are both great \\"Science Fiction\\" movies for people that hate ridiculous space aliens, beaming up, and all of that. Both the show and the movie are basically a space western with the same great characters (this movie takes place after the show).<br /><br />I saw Serenity first and then went back and watched the show. It was so disappointing watching the show toward the end knowing how good the show was and how it was cancelled. The show is better but this movie is great! You don't have to watch the show to enjoy Serenity.<br /><br />It's so great to see the entire cast together. They all play off each other and each have their own interesting dynamics. I smiled the entire time the movie was playing when I saw it in the theater. Without a doubt, Firefly and Serenity are my favorite show/movie of all time.
0896760278|3.0|Very good book showing how the dresses were made.   However I found that the clothing that were shown were for the higher class of people than what I was looking for.   I was interested in the regular day to day clothing of the average woman, home or working.
0316067598|4.0|Too much time initially spent on Afgan history and culture. The last two thirds of the book were riveting and I could not put the book down.
0316067598|5.0|A great chronicle of real heroes. No Hollywood hype here. Just a heartfelt tribute to fallen comrades in arms told by another hero who really cares.
0450011844|5.0|One of the all time great sf novels. The story of a boy who becomes a man, while both the women around him try to manipulate him, and the political and economic powers try to do away with him.    Cleverly manipulating religion on Arrakis, and using his own gifts from being the end of a long breeding program to produce a superhuman, Paul Atreides refuses to be cowed, and takes the fight to his enemies, changing the galaxy forever.
1594489505|5.0|Again, Hosseini has produced a book so good it defies description.  I thought THE KITE RUNNER was fantastic; it was the best book I read a year ago.  But A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is even better.  Perhaps I feel this way because I'm a woman and this is a book about women, but I don't think so.  I simply think Hosseini has hit his stride and will continue to get better and better.  He writes with empathy, compassion, and an understanding of the human heart that few ever attain.  One wonders if he ever studied writing.  Somehow I doubt it, although there's not one wrong note in the entire book.  Before reading him, I knew less than nothing about Afghanistan, and the truth was, I didn't care.  Now I do.  Thank you, Dr. Hosseini.  I can hardly wait for your next book.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0765340798|3.0|A little bit of an improvement on the last book in this series. I suppose some people may like these more than the denser Frank Herbert works. Maybe someone from Dimension X, or a Martian algae-beast. Again, interesting for the details, but that is probably about that, as we finally see explained what actually happened here. Corrin itself is of course referenced in the main series many times.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|The Capt. had to review this new release....it was touted as a sexy thriller etc....  It began very interesting, although the nudity was very tame...and the sex did not exhist.  The ending was insane, even by the Capt's tolerant standards for erotic farces....  I don't know what to make of this strange film....if you never rent or see it, you are not missing much...

B000SM7QUC|5.0|3 Cheers to Nikki Sixx for doing something outside of the box again! Nikki comes out of his closet with his skeletons and demons and shares an obviously devasting time in his life.  Heroin Diaries Soundtrack is an inspirational and very gutsy work of art. It was written from the heart with no stereotypes or intentions of airplay.  Kudos to Sixx for 1) Just sharing his life with his fans -- even the dark corners of it. 2) For his work with Running Wild in the Night giving hope to homeless kids. 3) For doing things that other rockstars don't -- Get Real & Be Honest!
B000QUCNOU|4.0|I have always been into dark and edgy films and this movie is one of the best i have seen in a long time.It's about the Zodiac killer,a man that murdered people in the Northern California area in the 1960's and was never caught.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith,a man that drew cartoons for a newspaper in the Northern California area in the 1960's while the Zodiac killer was commiting his murders.Graysmith becomes obsessed with the Zodiac killer and gets involved with the case by contacting police and getting info about who the suspects are.This obsession takes a toll on Graysmiths family,work and personal life and he gets very close to finding out who the killer is but never has quite enough evidence to close the case.This movie also stars Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., Ruffalo plays the head detective on the Zodiac case and Downey plays one of the newspaper writers covering the Killings.Downey brings some more light hearted moments to this mostly dark movie and he plays well off of Gyllenhaals semi-nerdy persona.This is overall a good movie that stays close to the facts of the real Zodiac case but this super attention to detail also makes the movie a little too long(2 and a half hours).There are more than a few scenes that easily could have been cut from the film to give it a more viewer friendly length,such as one scene where one of the detectives on the case tells Ruffalo that he is requesting to be taken off the case for family reasons.A few boaring scenes aside,this movie will keep you interested throughout the whole thing.This is almost a perfect film,it has a solid plot,a great cast,good music,stays true to the real Zodiac case and has murder scenes that are not over the top.This is a must see.
1400063515|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. I particularly liked his sense of humor and cantankerous approach to conventional ideas of probability and their (mis)application in areas like economics. It's refreshing to have the forecasting performance of so many social sciences, especially economics, so completely trashed, and it's a fascinating explanation of why forecasting has been such a failure. My only beef is that Taleb could have gotten his arguments across in 100 fewer pages without losing much substance. And his arguments are not always sewn together very tightly. But that's OK ... it's still easy to read, even if you're not sure you got it all. Read it and enjoy someone taking a shot at the intellectual establishment. It's fun!
074356619X|5.0|I may not go along with all of it, but I really liked listening to it.  The cd's in my car help me keep a positive attitude and keep trying to be a positive person.  Yes I have read it all before, but a different take is good.  Alot of our life experiences are exactly as we think they will be.  So why not think them to be wonderful? In my 70 years of life I continue to look for the good and try to extend it to others.  So thanks Rhonda Byrne and friends for extending it to me.

B000O178BY|3.0|i've listened to this album many times now and i think my evalution for the most part is an objective one.  i was not impressed with Year Zero upon first listen, but it grew on me a bit after a few more.   it borrows a lot from previous NIN material, but it's not enough for it to sound like a complete rehash.  there are plenty of great things going on musically, and sonically it is exceptional-- which is to be expected from NIN.  it also bears evidence that Trent has become a better lyricist over the years, and is definitely his most ambitious album conceptually as well.  the cryptic online campaign, whether completely commercial or artistic or both, was also very creative.   there's a great message hidden-- or maybe not so hidden-- within the whole concept and story.  unfortunately, as an album, it is lacking something which is difficult for me to zero in on.  maybe the album is just too long?  not nearly as long as the Fragile, of course, but some songs could have been cut (from both records actually).  regardless, i respect Trent for doing what he feels is right musically.  Year Zero is a slight disappointment for me as a fan, but it's not a bad album at all...  just sort of mediocre.  overall it is my least favorite studio album from Nine Inch Nails.  i'm hoping that Year One (or whatever the next album is titled) will be better.
B000LC55F2|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but I found the movie oonfusing and unwatchable. I'd rather not work hard to keep track of time frames and where the characters are supposed to be, or even if they should be.

B000NWWOQ8|5.0|A twisted soul, a childhood witness to a yet unspoken tragedy. Dexter's step father, a Miami beat cop with astute character perception recognizes something isn't quite right with the new addition to his family. Something he's seen many, many times before on the job.    But father knows best, grooming Dexter in the ways and means to satisfy his hunger- but only on those that deserve it. And methods to avoid detection, avoiding capture, to continue doing his good works.    Dexter works for the Miami Police, in the crime lab. In the entire department of detectives, only one has even a hint of what lies beneath the surface of the quiet lab tech.    Brilliant plot, appropriately dark, and full of twisted humor as well- if you can find a copy, grab it. Very worthwhile and entertaining. But some of the events and imagary are definietly not for the squeamish.
1591841666|3.0|Normally I like the books that Seth Godin puts out.  They're confrontational, off-beat, and they make you look at your current surroundings in a different light.  In his latest book, The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick), he attempts to explain the difference between when it's right to quit and when it's right to keep on slogging in order to separate yourself from others.  While I agree with his basic premise, this seems to be one of those \\"hindsight is 20/20\\" issues.<br /><br />The book is short..  as in a whopping 80 pages.  So regardless of whether you agree or disagree with him, the time investment here is minimal.  It's worth spending the hour or so to get his take on this.  The basic message as I saw it was that there's a \\"dip\\" in the process of going from beginner to expert, from starting out to dominating a market.  These dips are where things are not easy any more, not much fun any more, and it seems as if you've hit a brick wall.  But these barriers to excellence are what keeps the scarcity level up when it comes to being an expert in any given field.  Your goal is to understand whether you're in a dip (and whether you should push on) or whether you're in a cul-de-sac (where you'll never rise beyond what you are at that point).  Quitting in a dip is OK, if you determine that you can better utilize your time and talents in other areas where you are willing to push through the pain points.  Quitting in the dip is *not* OK if you're just too lazy and tired to spend the time and effort it takes to become an expert.  But for those who *are* willing to push past the dip, the rewards are high as few people are willing to put in that effort.  You could likely come up with a few other messages from the book, but that seems to be the overriding one.<br /><br />The problem I see here is that there's little to go on when it comes to picking out a dip vs. a cul-de-sac.  In hindsight, it's easy to tell when someone succeeded vs. when someone should have known there was no chance to win.  But when you're in the midst of a dip, you don't have the benefit of knowing how it's all going to turn out.  You may see that there's a chance to win, while everyone else sees a cul-de-sac.  It's easy to point out examples from the past, but how often do we know or point out stories of someone who continued to persevere and ended up dying a slow, quiet death anyway?  You really can't, and as such it makes it somewhat difficult to apply this book to the here and now.<br /><br />The basic message about dips and pushing through is important, and it's well worth examining your efforts in that light.  But if you're expecting a cut-and-dried formula to differentiate between dips and cul-de-sacs, as well as assurance as to how it will all turn out, you'll be highly disappointed.

0316168815|1.0|I couldn't finish reading this book after getting about 150 pages in.  This turned out to be a fortunate decision.  My wife tells me it got worse and worse.  I'm shocked at how well-recieved it was...  The writing is sloppy, we're given no descriptions of the characters, and the storyline makes you groan with its cliches.  What really annoyed me were the incredibly strained metaphors tossed around, dice in a Yatzee game of literature, spinning like Disneyland teapots in the cosmos of ludicrousness.  This was one gem: \\"leaden weights had been tied by anesthesia to the four corners of his consciousness\\".

B000065NOS|1.0|I guess it boosted five-foot tall simian Ben Stiller's ego to play a male fashion model.  Plus he got to hire his father Ben Stiller as the manager and his mother Ann Meara in the crowd scenes.  An utter waste of two hours and whatever it cost to produce this turkey.  The premise is retarded:  Male models are superstars.  Can anyone name a male model?  Oh, Ben Stiller is soooo hot when he pouts.  Jokes?  Story?  Hundreds of good stories out there, dozens of funny comedians, talented directors, beautiful actors and actresses, and THIS is what Hollywood churns out.  Crap from beginning to end.

B0002B15WE|5.0|I'm not your stereotypical guy. I don't drink, I don't watch football, I don't chase girls, and I certainly don't work out. I also don't like a lot of action movies- I mean, they can be fun, but there's only so many times I can watch some muscle bound uber man fire a machine gun while spewing out a string of four-letter words in the middle of a room where everything is exploding for some reason. It gets a bit old.    But Die Hard (along with a few other action flicks) is an exception. A huge exception. See, here's the thing; this movie rules. Few things get my testosterone surging as much as watching Bruce Willis take out an entire room of angry terrorists, or crawling through a ventilator shaft using wisecracks to vent his barely contained man-rage. Because when you get right down to it, Bruce is the freaking MAN. I mean, seriously, I practically grow an extra Y chromosome every time I watch him.  Remember all those Chuck Norris jokes that were popular a couple years ago? Bruce Willis has done all of that. Six times.     In all seriousness, Willis' performance is truly fantastic, nervy flurry of raw, unadorned masculinity. His character, John McClane, is one of the great tough-guy action heroes, thanks to his sharp one-liners (of course they're groaners, but in a good way), way-cool fightin' skills, and feral intelligence. Alan Rickman is also fantastic as the film's slick, coldly detached, and deliciously evil main villain, Hans Gruber. Throw in a loveable sidekick (Al Powell, who isn't nearly as one-dimensional as the \\"loveable sidekick\\" label might make him seem, played wonderfully by Reginald VelJohnson) and a love interest who manages to be waaaaaaaay more than your typical damsel in distress (kudos to actress Bonnie Bedelia, who pulls of the role of McClane's estranged wife with plenty of intelligence and panache), and you've got yourself an exciting, engaging, blood-pumping action classic.

B000002KNU|4.0|Although the Talking Heads' style would continue to shift and evolve throughout their career, the group's 1977 debut has the seeds of just about every element of their ever-changing sound; it's a scintillating combination of punk, art-rock, and funk, with chunks of pop (relatively speaking) and world music (a term I hate, but it seems to fit here) thrown in for good measure. The music is characterized by spiky rhythms, jittering guitars, and lead singer David Byrne's yelping, high-strung vocals. It's a sound that's full of nervous energy and excitable discomfort, a weirdly likeable mixture of catchiness and weirdness. The words are just as wonderfully offbeat. Full of subtle humor, unexpected insight, strange tension, goofball innocence, and nervous paranoia, the group's lyrics draw a wonderfully warped portrait of love and life in the modern world.<br /><br />The best songs on this album make it an excellent debut. \\"Uh Oh, Love Comes To Town\\" kicks off the proceedings with an intoxicating rush of Tropical-tinged weirdo-pop, with its swinging rhythms and spastic vocals. The lyrics are by turns funny and touching, as they relate the tale of an uptight workaholic who finds himself falling straight into love. There's something so wonderfully irresistible in Byrne's rapturous cry of \\"Jet pilot goin' out of control/ Ship captain on the ground/ Stock broker make a bad investment/ When love has come to town!\\" Other highlights include the leen, skittery funk-punk of \\"New Feeling,\\" which simulates a rush of unfamiliar emotions with hyperactive glee. I also love \\"Happy Day,\\" which builds tension in its brooding main verse before releasing it in a downright orgasmic chorus (seriously). \\"No Compassion\\" adds some cruel feedback and a darker lyrical bent to the mix, while \\"Don't Worry About The Government\\" is a fluttering, dreamy number with some intentionally naïve lyrics that defy you to figure out weather or not Byrne's being sarcastic. Of course, there's also the classic \\"Psycho Killer,\\" a darkly funny portrait of insanity and obsession, set to an unnerving rhythm. The record goes out on \\"Pulled Up,\\" a hyperactive rush that'll get your blood pumping and feet moving.<br /><br />But it isn't perfect; I could do without the somewhat dull, repetitive \\"Tentative Decisions,\\" or the stiff, generic pseudo-funk of \\"Who Is It?\\" \\"The Book I read\\" and \\"First Week/ Last Week... Carefree\\" are similarly unimpressive (although the former does have a certain hypnotic charm).<br /><br />But really, with songs as good as this album's highlights, there's very little to complain about. Great stuff from a band that would get even better.cho Killer,\\" a darkly funny portrait of insanity and obsession, set to an unnerving rhythm.

B000UNYJV8|5.0|I'm so glad this film saw some theater time in the states. Even in Pittsburgh of all places! Saw it at the first showing, having waiting several months to see it.  Wasn't disapointed.<br /><br />A lot of people are going to inevitably slag on this because there's never going to be a film depicting skins that's going to please everyone (some fresshies are going to inform us that not all skins... blah blah blah).<br /><br />This is doubtlessly the most honest take on skins, and the writing comes off as realistic, as do the characters which has everything to do with stellar performances.  And Graham who plays Combo... this guy is crazy, off the charts talented.  Its a good movie even if you're not interested specifically in the subculture it depicts.  If you've got a chance to, I say don't miss it.<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD to come to the States. I'm going to track down Dead Man's Shoes next.
0316067598|5.0|I loved this book.  I bought the audiobook, which was excellent.  The reader was fantastic.  What a great storyteller -- very emotional.
0307346609|4.0|I will spare you the details of the story.  In short, it is a good book about what happens when a zombie virus infects the human race.  It is a collection of stories from different people around the world about the Zombie War and its aftermath.  Lots of fighting, zombies trying to eat people and governments and military trying to combat the threat.  Most zombie tales involve a small group of people (typically in a farmhouse or something) but this book is the entire world.  It tracks the spread of the zombie virus, government reaction (like trying to hide or contain it) and how people fought back.  If you like end-of-the-world type books, this is great.  If you like blood and gore, it is OK as the book is more about the the war than the horror.
0380715430|5.0|If so, this is the book for you.  Bryson takes you on a humorous and fascinating journey through the history of English, and explains the sources of many idiosyncrasies of the language, including odd spellings, irregular verbs, plural nouns like mouse/mice, and more.  If you have ever felt stupid because you couldn't remember whether to spell something with ie or ei, this is the book for you -- your self-esteem will improve after reading this book: It isn't your fault, it's this crazy language!
B000SO7OMA|5.0|For fans of Loreena McKennitt, this is the concert video that we have all been waiting for... it is just stunning!<br /><br />There is a possible point of confusion here, as there are TWO versions of the same performance offered on Amazon. The ONLY difference is the packaging, both contain 3 disks (2 cd's and one DVD). This set is packaged in a DVD sized container, and the other is packaged as a jewel box set. At first, I ordered both, thinking that one set was a DVD video and the other was a CD audio version. After I realized my mistake, I canceled the jewel box order and kept this DVD sized package (which was cheaper at the time).<br /><br />Don't get \\"suckered in\\" like I did, for awhile Amazon listed the two versions as a buy BOTH together deal, but this has now been changed to a more realistic offer.<br /><br />Whichever version you buy, I am sure you will be captivated by this magnificent performance, recorded in a magnificent setting!
B000FG5Q1W|4.0|this band is a gas. on the opener \\"country girl,\\" you can feel the grit between the notes. it's a raucous grinding out of dirty chords. a great rock anthem. the next number, \\"nitty gritty,\\" is a fantastic rolling stonesy rocker with a groove that moves into your bloodstream. there then ensues eight more greasy gems; most notable among them, the slide guitar frenzy called \\"the 99th floor,\\" and the glam-rock strut titled \\"dolls.\\" on the latter track i encourage you to listen to what is going on behind the music. that's the world back there. everyone carrying on with their lives, but this song has taken over and nobody even knows it. far out! and the fun-loving countrified stomp \\"hell's coming down\\" is a hoot, too. my final judgement: inpolite, cocky music. buy it and enjoy.

B000003N7R|4.0|ah, ellington and coltrane. two of my favorites. here they produced a very fine set of jazz, indeed. this disc has a bit more bite than the ellington and johnny hodges duo albums, but the bite is tame by coltrane's usual standards. coltrane is more restrained here than is usual, but that tone remains a spellbinder. while this is not amongst the very best work that either of these gentlemen have done, it is an album that any jazz fan would do well to acquire.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Not only is the HD video quality amazingly sharp and detailed, the sound is also great.  The action from this movie may be a little slow at first, but as soon as the battle starts, there's no stopping.    The great thing about HD DVD is the ability to have PiP to watch the whole movie in blue screen while the actual movie is playing.  From that you can see how the movie was made, and the different affects and CGs that were added to it.  I really enjoyed seeing what was \\"real\\" vs. what was \\"computer generated\\" for this movie.  I haven't tried the web-enabled feature yet, but from what I've seen so far, I highly doubt I would be dissapointed.    (And for a few dollars more, the Combo disc is so worth it.  I can watch it on my HD DVD player, or I can lend it to my friend and let them watch the DVD side.  Or, I can go to another room and enjoy the DVD side.  Great flexibility).
B000GIXEIG|5.0|The cinematography of this movie, shot in Iceland, is breathtaking.  The movie seems to capture the dreariness of the \\"indoor life\\" as I imagine it was while carrying us along an amazing viking adventure at the same time.  This is a movie I have watched several times, purchased for my library and endlessly recommend to friends.
B00007LTIA|5.0|I've been listening to this album on and off for about 25 years.  After reading a number of the reviews, I can see that there's a large number of people who appreaciate the work.  I just want to vent on a few points.  First of all as to Jon Anderson's lyrics.  Since my philosophical and religious perspective comes from one of traditional Christianity, I clearly do not agree with Anderson's spiritual  views.  Nevertheles, they are not nonsense.  Let me try to say this as kindly as possible.  Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it is nonsense, comprende?  I swear if I hear another person complain about Anderson's lyrics I'm going to scream.  Have any of you ever read any decent poetry?  It gives you feelings, and points you in a thought's direction, but it does not slap you in the face with meaning.    Secondly, I have no idea what these debates about prog rock are.  I don't even know what prog rock is, nor do I care to.  Yes is a completely unique group of individuals and comparing them to the likes of ELP or King Crimson(neither of which I care for) is just plain dumb.    Third, what is all this business about Bruford?  I know I'm going to step on a lot of toes here, but don't you all know that the drummer is the most replaceable member of any band?  Yes is Anderson Howe Squire/Wakeman drummer in that order.  I'm sorry all you drummers, get over it.    Lastly, this is a GREAT album.  I do not rate it the tops because I believe Close To The Edge holds that place.  But tales is the pinnacle of the Yes journey.  No one has ever done what they did, before or after, and their work speaks for itself.  End of rant.
B000BCE918|5.0|All three movies in one convenient box!  I purchased this set to replace my combination of VHS and DVD singles that made up my personal copies.  The prints are excellent and well worth the price and convenience of having them as a stand alone set.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|This movie is great. High drama, generally amazing effects and a fantastic back story.  I knew that they had used filters to make the picture look a bit grainy as if it were a comic book but I did find it very distracting in HD because you could really see it.  I thought that there was a problem with the BD initially but a friend had the same thing and it was there as well.  BD is a great product and this is a great movie on BD but I think I may have enjoyed it more on regular DVD where the effects were more subtle.
B000QQFKYE|2.0|I've seen all of Lynch's films, but I think there is a fine line between intrigue and boredom. I GET IT! Surreal, dream-like, abstract, absurd, think for yourself--I GOT IT ALREADY! It still doesn't change the fact that Lynch never intended for this to be a feature film. Instead, it was supposed to be a string of unrelated pre-written scenes. People say this is a great film because you can make any connection you wish between the unrelated scenes. Greaaaaaaaaat. Whoopee. The bottom line is they were originally unrelated scenes. \\"Inland Empire\\" along with \\"Eraserhead\\" are bottom of the barrel Lynch. Excruciatingly boring, but atmospheric and well filmed. That's what \\"Inland Empire\\" has in its favor--cinematography, lighting, atmosphere. Three hours is self-indulgent for no story. I can watch grass grow too, but I'd rather see something of more substance. I liked \\"Mulholland Drive\\", and it wasn't exactly linear, but it was more coherent than \\"Inland Empire\\". Now I can see the Lynch devotee loving this film or arrogant, narcissistic (artistic), egocentric individuals also loving this film, but I watch with a critical eye. Just because you're David Lynch doesn't mean you're God. Lynch made \\"Lost Highway\\" a less-than-stellar film, thus he's merely human and prone to human indulgence like finding a digital camera and going hog wild with it, disregarding storyline and storytelling. Let's hope the failure of \\"Inland Empire\\" will result in a better Lynch film next time.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|the woman is just so real. when she is talking about the videos at times she is funnier than any comedian and i dont think she even realizes it. i really wish we would have some new music by stevie as i wasn't crazy about another greatest hits collection but this one is truly special.
B000OY8NII|4.0|Very good box set for anyone who enjoyed the Series.  I just wish they had put in a little more Deleted scenes and other stuff.  Though it was nice to be able to listen to all the podcasts.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|No, it is Gothika with a K not a C.  Well it does not matter how the spelling goes it only is about what the future shows.  Berry is sexy in scary delight and watch this to realize what happens in plight.  Things in this movie are not what they seem but I would imagine it would help with a little Jim Beam.  In the end she is right and the goodness prevails, the real question is are you satisfied with this tale?
B00005JPLW|5.0|If you like big time action movies, I think you will absolutely love this film for its pure entertainment value. If you view this film expecting a history lesson, you are probably going to be disappointed. The film does more or less follow the storyline of the Battle at Thermopolaye as told by Herodotus, but Frank Miller uses a great deal of artistic license as he tells one of history's most famous military tales where a small, well-trained force valiantly holds its own against oppressive numbers. He presents both the Greeks and Persians as grossly exaggerated caricatures of good and evil - the Spartans presented as the perfect male warriors, chisled with long flowing hair, fighting for truth, justice and the Spartan way, while the Persians as the monsterously predatory attackers, seeking to assimilate everything in its path while decimating any resistance. Therein lies some of the artistic license.    The actors give solid perfromances and the action is incredible. While it is gory, much of the savagry is implied rather than exploited. The film style provides an ancient feel as well.    I have read a great deal of criticism of the film for its historical inaccuracies, and certainly there are probably many. But, in general, Herodotus describes a tale of a small band of exceptionally trained soldiers holding off a vast army for several days at the pass of Thermopolaye in 480 B.C. The film delivers that story in incredible fashion.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|This movie Inland Empire is a horrible embarassment to the great legacy of David Lynch.  This movie is at the same amature level as Eraser Head.  Eraser Head was an avantgarde near silent film from the late 70s which we accepted as shocking art rather than an entertaining film which it was not.     Inland Empire is hardly art or artistic.  This movie has no vision. It is cold, bitter, monotone, and without any plot.  The actual filming is crystaline and well done and sure, there are a few scenes that look interesting and artistic similar to that of Lynch's other movies.  But we've already seen this before in other films.     Inland Empire can best be compared to that of The Lost Highway but much much worse and not really worth the rent unless you plan to be bored and annoyed out of your head.    Another problem is that David Lynch casted old has beens in this film.  Laura Dern may be a good actress but she is much older now and long durated close ups of her face is not interesting and thought provoking at all, it is tedius and unappealing. This movie created a feeling in me of apathy and dislike towards each character.     There is no plot. This is not a twisted bizarre movie like Twin Peaks or even Mulholland Drive.      This is NOT recommended.  Watch Dune instead that movie looks great compared to this.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|David Lynch is truly one of the few directors working today who approaches the very core of what cinema is and what makes it interesting.. He knows the ingredients and the elements and how to use them together to make a painting.. Like most paintings Lynch's movies require some work and investigation from the audience.. They contain structure and yet there is a spontaneous touch that brings life and possibilities to his work.. Some people will be frustrated.. just as some people are frustrated when they look at a picasso or a jackson pollock.. but the images stay in their minds.. it is an experience that no one really forgets... It is like probing into a part of your brain that is normally subconcious or unconcious..<br />Inland empire is made of a gorgeous fabric.. It is a perfect melding of space and time.. It has a peculiar narrative structure which will for a time confuse you and will make you wonder which story you are watching.. but in the end it comes together beautifully... I do not like giving away things - but i would recommend that the viewer pay close attention to Laura dern's 'self image'..<br />The photographic techniques in this film are interesting as Lynch is working with a new medium.. it is like no home video you have ever seen.. This movie truly presents new possibilities to anyone who is interested in making movies...<br />It is hard to compare two works of art - but i would say this is really up there with mulholland drive on Lynch's list of best films...
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Yes, this album isn't as progressive as some of theaters other albums.  It's different.  And not in a metallica - Load Reload kind of way.  I havge most of theaters other albums, so I know what I'm talking about.  I don't see why change can't be good sometimes.      With tracks like this dying soul, Endless sacrifice, Honor thy father, and In the name of god, (A briliant song by the way) Dream theater took a step in another direction with this album.  Instead of forcing their progressive sound once again, this decided to simplify (Albeit not too much) and maybe this is why people don't like this album.      But all the songs on the album are great in their own right, and Dream theater is about stepping over boundaries.  That's what makes them such a great band.  Having a unique album like this one only makes them better....not worse.  I can understand why people might not like it's lack of progressiveness, but get over it...it's a great metal record, and it's a great Dream theater record.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I never understood the lure of \\"Phantom.\\" Friends who'd seen the stage version all raved about it, but when I saw it I was left with that awe they'd all had.<br /><br />Until I saw this movie...

B000V4UFZK|5.0|I can't really review this release since it hasn't come out yet, but if I understand correctly it's not going to have a 2-disc special feature? I was involved with one of the investigations that is suppose to be part of the special features and we were told that it was going to be a 2-disc special with one whole disc of features. It's disappointing to learn that this is not the case. But I'm sure it will be interesting nonetheless...I know they got at least one evp at our location and the other locations investigated are all very haunted. I can't wait for it to come out!

B000KX0IOA|5.0|I was born many decades after the Mahatma's passing, and was privileged to see this picture when it premiered in our town in India. I bought the DVD so my children could learn of the man who played a central role in setting India free.    It is in some sense, entirely befitting that the movie was made by a Britisher, and an actor of British/Indian origin in the lead role. Other reviwers have complained of a bias -- I see none, except perhaps a bias towards the deification of Gandhi. I would have liked to see more of the human side of the Mahatma in the movie.     The DVD has been beautifully mastered, and plays very well on an HDTV. It definitely has a place in the library of anyone else interested in the impact of Gandhi's principles on history.
B0000041WV|5.0|If you are intellectually compelled by the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Berlioz (and Brahms too), then Dvorak will become one of your favorites.<br /><br />Dvorak gets ignored or dismissed by some people as a second or even third-rate composer. This is extremely unfair, since his inspiration level was extraordinary, more than above average. Furthermore, many of their comments and arguments are merely reinforcements of already-made opinions, such as those by George Bernard Shaw. These folks have been reading, and not listening.<br />If you buy this set, I ask you to do a few things: throw away the notion that Wagner somehow plays an extremely influential role in Dvorak's music. Many people say that Dvorak's early symphonies are Wagnerian, and that they are naïve.<br />Naïve, maybe. More accurate is: healthy. Wagnerian? Hardly. Unless you have been obsessively reading G.B. Shaw's opinions on Dvorak, you are not likely to make a very big Dvorak-Wagner connection, even if the young Dvorak WAS a big Wagnerite. Instead you are going to think Dvorak-Beethoven, or even Dvorak-Mozart. Those two seem a far more prominent influence on Dvorak, in my opinion--especially in the long-term. Dvorak had a gift for Mozartian lyricism that I find unsurpassed in the music of his time, and he successfully combined it -more often than not- with a Beethovenian strength. Substantive is another good word to describe his symphonies. His third symphony is a perfect example: themes are developed very finely and boldly, augmented by the right structure (speaking on my experience aurally, NOT technically).<br />Dvorak's symphonies are for those who enjoy Beethoven and Mozart type symphonies, for they're the kind that don't depend on an outer, extra-musical, source for direction. It is often said that Dvorak was inspired by his Czech homeland. Don't let this confuse you to think that his symphonies are about landscapes. Nor are they merely music for music's sake.<br />You shouldn't worry about whether Dvorak was influenced by Wagner, Brahms, Beethoven, Mozart, or Satan himself...because in the end Dvorak is Dvorak.<br /><br />Symphonies Nos.1 & 2:<br />This is pretty early Dvorak, he was unknown to the world as a composer. He thought big at this time: probably the only significant Wagnerian influence, largesse. As the booklet notes, these two symphonies are very long, and they are not perfect structurally, and they are a bit repetitious in spots. No doubt Dvorak WOULD have edited them and refined them if he hadn't lost them. Still, you can enjoy these...the last movement to Symphony No.1 in particular.<br /><br />Symphony No.3:<br />This is what I consider the best Dvorak symphony of them all. I can't begin to describe how much I love the opening movement. This symphony is epic without all the cymbals and drums that other composers seem to lean on, and lyrical on an incredibly original scale. What I can say cohesively about this symphony is this: you can listen to so many (certainly not all) symphonies after Beethoven that can't keep up the thread of inspiration without breaking into some not-too-great mid-climax. This symphony is such a wonderful relief from those. It defies the notion that great symphonies after Ludwig can't be written in the traditional way, with a purely musically aesthetic direction. I urge you to listen to Beethoven's symphonies, then to this one.<br /><br />Symphony No.4:<br />The third movement is what will propel you to listening to this entire symphony. Out of all the symphonies not counting the first two, this one can seem a little tired. Certainly not as well argued as the third. But nevertheless, you will find it a great listen if you take the time.<br /><br />Symphony No.5:<br />Next to the third, this is my favorite Dvorak symphony. Like that one, the thread of inspiration is continuous: this is music that will stick in your head the way the \\"Ode to Joy\\" theme will... (that is NOT a comparison of the themes). The finale movement will have you convinced that Dvorak is one of the greatest composers of all time (that doesn't have to be true, but you might feel that way.) What amazes me about this last movement is that Dvorak can pull off a bring-down-the-house climax without bringing it down on himself. As I mentioned before, he doesn't need all those exotic percussions to convince you that he is great...lovable though those cymbals et al may be.<br /><br />Symphony No.6:<br />Sometimes you are allowed to hear that this is an underrated symphony. Most people wouldn't know anyhow, since Symphonies 7, 8, and 9 are the most marketed. And this is a great symphony, though not as powerfully argued than the third or fifth. It is a little more what we think of as `Dvorakian'. Composing strong finales was something Dvorak seems to have been good at, and this is no exception. Once again, the symphony is a consistent and continuous thread of inspiration: all the movements fit together. It is exciting and lyrical. Underrated yes, but not nearly as underrated as the 3rd and 5th.<br /><br />Symphony No.7:<br />This is the most un-Dvorakian symphony that Dvorak wrote: here it can be said that Dvorak really was under some other composer's unfluence: Brahms. The result is not as interesting as it may sound. Not to me anyhow.<br />Nevertheless, what we have here is wonderfully original music. In the one movement that Dvorak sounds like himself, the third movement, we hear what is probably his best movement in the entire canon. It is very arresting music aurally: this is music that makea you feel that it was MEANT to be written. When I listen to this movement, it opens with what to me sounds like a kind of `swimming' music, something in the water pushing around. Something that propels: sometimes strongly, sometimes softly. This is yet another example of how amazing Dvorak's inspiration was: beautiful and lyrical, but also propelling and powerful.<br /><br />Symphony No.8:<br />Some rate this far higher than the New World Symphony. Partly this is because they've grown tired Dvorak's last symphony, and partly because it IS better. This symphony is to Dvorak what the Seventh is to Beethoven, top-tier, but not recognized by the general public (perhaps not true anymore). This symphony is joyous, and pure joy.<br /><br />Symphony No.9:<br />In some ways I wish I had come to this symphony last, but like most people it was my first Dvorak. I now know this symphony like the back of my hand, and I'm still in love with it, even though I sometimes give it a more `passive' listen. But for newcomers to Dvorak, this is truly the best. A grand-scale symphony that is SO inspired you may not get it out of your head for months.<br />Slow movement: this was the first slow movement of any symphony that I enjoyed. Afterwards I was actually able to listen to the Adagio from that other Great Ninth: Beethoven's.<br />Fast movements: I suppose you're allowed to say that this is kind of a `program' symphony, but it is not written like one, and the story of Hiawatha -considered to be the inspiration--was an afterthought in any case (a big debacle too!)<br />In any case, Dvorak unloads the full adventurous spirit on us...this is symphonic meat indeed, full-blooded pedigree.<br />In some ways, you need to listen to this symphony first to get hold of the Dvorak idiom. And after you traverse from No.1 back to No.9, you can find yourself appreciating it once again.<br /><br />Dvorak isn't one of those composers whom I feel sorry for because he gets beaten up verbally so much by his detractors...he can hold his own ground without my help. It's his critics I feel sorry for, for beating themselves up trying to convince themselves that Dvorak was a bad composer on the grounds that he didn't break new `ground'. Just remember who was thought to be old-fashioned in HIS day: none other than J.S. Bach himself. His own sons were embarrassed by his reputation for old-fashionedness. But Bach has more than held his own high seat in the history of music, and I believe it will be the case with Dvorak as well.<br /><br />Amen.higher than the New World Symphony.

B00004VVNB|1.0|Sorry, but since \\"Logan's Run\\" is one of my all-time favorite books, I was really disappointed in this rendition of it. Certainly you can't expect filmmakers to \\"film the book,\\" but when a book is this special, you want the movie to be so, too. Michael York is just too old and Jenny Agutter, though a wonderful actress, just didn't fit in Jessica's skin. Though I saw the film back in the '70s and now have a copy of it, try as I might, I just can't seem to get past how it botches my vision of this fabulous book. Read the book! An extraordinary, visionary tale!
1594489505|4.0|As a huge fan of this author's THE KITE RUNNER, I was looking forward to his next book.  Here, he has created memorable female characters and a vivid story that is unforgettable. I liked the fact that the women represented a broad spectrum of women in Afghanistan, even if the male characters are somewhat limited.    It's not quite as good as KR, in my opinion, because he inserts alot of political history in a somewhat clunky manner.  However, anyone who has read both of these books will really have a much better sense of daily life in Afghanistan and how the country and people have been affected by recent history.
6305558167|5.0|The screen darkens and words appear referring to a time long gone by...ominous music from Richard Wagner's \\"Gotterdammerung\\" begins to swell... suddenly there are towering flames in the night and amongst the trees armored knights spill over a ridge in mortal combat... Welcome to the story of Excalibur and the king who will wield it. From those opening moments I was completely hooked, so it came as a surprise to me that some film critics complained that it wasn't realistic (actual armor was so heavy that knights could not walk around in it) and the dialog too melodramatic (not faithful to the serious tone of Thomas Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" upon which this film is mostly based). But they missed the point here-this is a film constructed solely of myth and legend, of wizards and sorcery, peopled with larger than life characters and so grandly filmed that it won an Academy Award for best cinematography. The sound track is credited to Trevor Jones, but he also makes use of stirring passages from the world of classical music at key points in the film (portions of Wagner's operatic \\"Ring\\" cycle and choral music from Carl Orff's \\"Carmina Burana\\"). Add into this heady mix a few images from Norse sagas (such as the body of a dead hero transported out to sea on a Viking ship) and you end up with what I've always enjoyed about this film-a magical and bold interpretation of the day's of King Arthur aimed at an adult audience. (There are violent battle sequences and nudity-I don't mean to mislead anyone here.)     If at this point you're still hesitating as to whether to buy this DVD or not, I'll leave you with one of my favorite moments: Merlin stands by the water's edge, and as Wagnerian music begins to soar around you Excalibur dramatically bursts through the liquid surface and rises forth in the hand of The Lady of the Lake. (An indelible image that still gives me a thrill each time I see it.)    Motion Picture Sidenote: Appearing here are several stars before they became famous-Patrick Stewart (Star Trek's Capt. Picard), Liam Neeson (\\"Schindler's List\\"), and Helen Mirren (recent Academy Award winner for Best Actress in \\"The Queen\\").

0307277887|4.0|Dexter Morgan works as a police blood spatter analyst. He's handsome, charming, witty, and well liked. He has a boat that he takes out in the bay. A girlfriend with two very lovely children. He also has a sister Deborah Morgan who is a cop and works in vice but desperately wants to be in homicide. He seems like a normal human with a normal life. But the problem is Dexter is a fake. He has no emotions at all and mimics his human behavior and every now and then Dexter's Dark Passenger takes over and Dexter kills someone--brutally and with no remorse.    From the first chapter you know that Dexter, the narrator of the story, is a serial killer. He prides himself on his neatness and the fact that all his victims truly deserve to die. You see, Dexter only kills other serial killers and he does a lot of research to be sure that he has the right person before he dismembers them and wraps the parts in nice, neat packages. But in spite of this, you find yourself liking Dexter. He is witty and charming and his observations on the human species, a species he doesn't consider himself belonging to, are outrageous and nearly always spot on. Similar to Boondock Saints, you find yourself routing for Dexter even knowing that he's not a truly nice person or one you'd want to meet in a dark alley or a well lit street for that matter.    The writing is tight and draws you in. Lindsay pulls you into the story and makes you like someone that we all know we should find reprehensible from the get go. Yet there we are, hoping he will help his sister and catches the killer who shares his M.O. But life isn't simple or easy and some novels leave you wondering what your true beliefs are and just where black turns to grey.

0385473788|1.0|My encounter with Anne Frank has been powerful enough--and my disgust with the liberties taken with this English translation--that I wonder whether I ought to brush up on my German/Dutch and pick up the real definitive edition (with the complete original versions) so that I can find out what Anne really wanted us to know. Red flags went off constantly as I read this English translation: the register is incredibly high-flung, broad, and literary, and not at all typical of what any early adolescent might ever want to produce. While I didn't have the original versions to compare, I did finally find the silver bullet in the entry dated November 17, 1943 where the expression \\"Der Mann hat einen grossen Geist / Und ist so klein von Taten!\\" is translated by Susan Massotty as follows: \\"The spirit of the man is great, / How puny are his deeds.\\" How dare the translator take such liberties, and how did she get away with doing so? Another problem with this \\"definitive\\" edition is that none of Mirjam Pressler's editing intrusions are identified or explained; we're simply told that this edition includes much of the B-version of Anne's diary. This translation is a horrifying insult to Anne and all English-speaking readers deserve better.

B00005JPMZ|4.0|I was just a little too old when \\"Turtlemania\\" hit the world. Still, I saw the first Turtle movie in the theaters with my folks whilst on Spring Break. Leaving the cinema, my dad taught me the phrase, \\"You couldn't pay me to do that again.\\"    Two years late my friend Seth and I saw the second one. My reaction was one of ambivalence. What difference a year of high school makes. Two years after that I started watching the third one on TV. I barely made it in 15 minutes.     Half a lifetime later, the Turtles are making a comeback, and I see why. This installment carries enough gravitas to appeal to all the old Turtle fans, and entertain the kids watching now.    It begins in the middle of the story. The Turtles have recently defeated the Shredder, but the team has sundered. A morose Leonardo has travelled to Central America to learn to be a better leader. How exactly doing this would make him a better leader isn't explained. The others aren't doing much better, Donatello's stuck in tech-support world. Michaelangelo, always the party animal, is a children's party dummy. And Rapheal, the short fuse, has taken up vigilantism.     Meanwhile, Captain Picard is gathering up his old army of immortal stone warriors and the 13 monsters he brought into the world 3,000 years earlier. He's got both April O'Neil and Casey Jones (man, was I glad to see him in this!), and the Foot Clan working for him.     Great voice talent drove the otherwise hackneyed plot and its deus ex machina ending along. The animation was also superb, probably the best there is. The scene with Leo and Raph was a masterpiece of animation.     Enjoy the Turtles once again. I'm certain more's coming!
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Let there be no doubt, Anthony Hopkins plays a very good \\"bad guy\\".  Obviously, his best role was in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" where he was evil personified.  However, in \\"Fracture\\", he is also excellent as the alleged killer of his philandering wife.<br /><br />In brief, \\"Fracture\\" is a court room drama.  Hopkins plays the part of Ted Crawford who has chosen to murder his wife in cold blood.  The crime is to be prosecuted by Ryan Gosling playing the role of Willy Beachum.  To Beachum, the case is a \\"slam dunk\\".  Apparently, there is a signed confession, a murder weapon and a motive.  However, as we soon learn, the case is far more complicated than it appears to be a first glance.  Ted Crawford is a clever man who has left no tracks.  Indeed, he is acquitted.  But hubris then takes hold.  If only he had chosen not to continue to press the envelope.<br /><br />On small criticism I have of the movie is that the gun was never traced by its serial number.  When you see the movie, this point will make sense.  It's a clear weakness in the plot.  If not, the police department involved was monumentally incompetent.<br /><br />In spite of my criticism, the movie is worth seeing.  Not great, but certainly good.

B000NDIAWY|4.0|Brandi Carlile's CD was a birthday present from my daughter who thought I would like her music.  I had never heard of her.  I popped her into the changer in June.  Her music is excellent.  T-Bone Burnett's production does a good job of varying the sounds on each song; each stands out as unique.  \\"Turpentine\\" is soft and sounds like a classic jewel from a previous decade, \\"It's six AM & I'm all messed up; I didn't mean to waste your time so I'll fall back in line, but I'm warning you we're growing up.\\"  \\"Wasted\\" is a sweet track that builds strongly with Carlile's vocals sounding wise and reflective with Tim Hanseroth's electric guitar flaring at the perfect moment.  The Indigo Girls lend backup vocals on the mellow folk song \\"Cannonball,\\" \\"Bright light like white lightning.\\"  The set closer \\"Again Today\\" is a tear jerker that explodes into a guitar storm with Carlile's vocals hitting both the sadness & the fire.  Of my two very favorites, the opener \\"Late Morning Lullaby\\" soothes as Brandi's voice breaks into the higher notes on \\"Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming.\\"  \\"Have You Ever\\" echoes classic folk with Carlile's vocals sparking the melody, \\"Have you ever been out walking in the snow?  Tried to get back where you were before; You always end up not knowing where to go.\\"  \\"The Story\\" is an excellent set.  Enjoy!

You all came to this page for different reasons, and I am going to ask more from you than maybe what you came for.  When you can't walk anymore, you crawl....and when you can't do that, you find someone to carry you....and if you can't do something smart, do something right.  Everyone who came here is passionate about Firefly and/or Serenity, in one way or t'other, so I am asking you to use your voice, email, snail mail and any other venue or ear and eye available to you to NOT let Serenity be the conclusion of Firefly -- on the small screen or the big screen, don't much matter.  Whether you think Firefly/Serenity is genius and all things good, or if you think it's a compromise or that it's been pillaged -- you all watched with interest (purchasing is better).  If you love it, there will be more for you to love.  If you didn't, you watched with hope anyway and the continuation of the series or the movie can keep that hope alive.....where Joss actually gets the freedom and money he deserves to do this Verse the justice it deserves.       So call, write, email and simply badger the bibbledy out of NBC (who owns Universal & Sci-Fi network), ABC, CBS, the CW, USA, TNT...and let's not forget the big Cable pillars - Showtime & HBO.  Since Fox screwed the whole thing up in the first place, they can kiss Mal's shiny hat when he is King of all Londinum.      SPOILERS:  I know in my heart that Wash LIVES!!...and so does Shepherd Book.  It was all simply a bad dream sequence, right??!!

B00005JPQR|4.0|The Jason Bourne series is nothing if not consistent (I've given each of the films exactly four stars), and you've got to give a franchise credit for that. Most trilogies have their ups and downs--most start up, then go down, then go down even further, but in ULTIMATUM, we finish a trifecta of action spy flicks that's fun from front to back.<br /><br />Here's why it doesn't get that fifth star, for me: 1) the revelation at the end is kind of what we've thought all along, and merely adds names and faces to the bad guys we knew were there; 2) if you actually are able to suspend your disbelief for this film, then you must believe that Jason Bourne is the only smart person to ever work for the CIA. I mean, these guys fall for everything, you know? 3) The fistfights consist of a degree of damage that would kill most of us, but when the pretty girl takes a fist sandwich twice to the mouth, she emerges looking like a Revlon ad.<br /><br />Here's why ULTIMATUM deserves all four of the other stars: fun, fun,  and more fun. Not just for the action, which rockets with the speed of a shooting star and crunches and smashes with all the ferocity of highlights from THE ROAD WARRIOR. No, it's fun (if implausible) to watch Bourne trick the keystone CIA cops at every turn, and he usually does it in a way I never see coming--a good reason for me not to be in the CIA, I can't help but think.<br /><br />Greengrass is in top form again, too, cutting scenes from the end of SUPREMACY into the beginning and the end of this movie in a way that illuminates (as opposed to replicates). And nobody--I mean nobody--manages the pace of action flicks like this guy. Even the dialogue is kinetic: people move and do things, all to adrenaline-laced soundtrack, while they talk.<br /><br />I don't see them making a fourth film (THE BOURNE VISECTOMY, or maybe THE BOURNE LOBOTOMY, or perhaps JASON BOURNE FORGETS ALL OVER AGAIN!!), and I think that's all to the good. Let the series finish on top and not suffer the same ignomious fate that has befallen so many other good, original films.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")has befallen so many other good, original films.

B00009UW0N|5.0|Here's one of the seminal entries in my own personal \\"You can't go through life without seeing this movie\\" cadre. HALLOWEEN stands right up there with THE EXORCIST as one of the finest horror films ever made. Unlike THE EXORCIST, however, HALLOWEEN is a film of absolute, horrifying simplicity.<br /><br />You're familiar with the setup already, probably, even if you have not see it. HALLOWEEN was the first of its kind, but there have been many imitators. Still, for the uninitiated, here it is:<br /><br />Fifteen years ago, six year old Michael Myers killed his older sister (who had been frolicking with another teenager only moments before). He hasn't spoken a word since. His doctor, overplayed with cheezy brilliance by the one and only Donald Pleasance, has given up trying to help him. All he wants to do is keep him locked up.<br /><br />So, naturally, Michael escapes. Back to the town of Haddonfield, the scene of his first murder. You see, in the words of Dr. Loomis, Michael has been \\"waiting for a secret, silent alarm to trigger him off.\\" And THAT means that Laurie, a teenage babysitter played by a very young scream queen we now know as Jamie Lee Curtis, is about to have a VERY bad night. Still, it'll be even worse for her decidedly more promiscuous, and kill-able, friends.<br /><br />That's all, by the way. No deep meaning, no explanation, no accounting for why Michael can't be stopped, even after taking a hanger in the eye, a knife in the gut, six shots from a .38 at point blank range, and a plunge off a balcony. He's the boogeyman, and that's all we ever need to know. He walks, never runs, to get you. And he always knows where you are.<br /><br />Sound familiar? It should. But this was the first and best of its kind, shot with shadow, style, and simplicity. It also has the creepiest soundtrack in the history of horror, played on nothing more than a single piano with a few synthesizer effects. John Carpenter, who also directed this masterwork and prototype of the modern slasher, probably recorded it on his own piano at home--I have no way of knowing this, but since he's the composer, I've always liked to imagine it.<br /><br />If you liked any of the FRIDAY the 13TH movies, or SCREAM, or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, or any of their endless stream of sequels (which, sad to say, HALLOWEEN has had a few too many of, too), then you would do well to go back to the only one directed by John Carpenter, the father of the genre.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")his own piano at home--I have no way of knowing this, but since he's the composer, I've always liked to imagine it.

B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Getting acquainted with this album was such a happy joyous experience for me (particularly because the last of George's solo albums I'd heard prior to this one was the awful 'Extra Texture'), and it turned into one of those albums which I find myself loving more and more with each and every listen.  Everything about this album just seems so great and perfect, even right down to the eponymous title.  Normally I'm not really keen on self-titled albums, esp. if they're not debut albums, but in this instance it just seems so right, like any other title would be a mistake.  Like the songs on it, it was the statement of a man very much at peace in his life, going through some really happy and fulfilling experiences, like getting married for the second time and finally becoming a daddy.  And knowing how happy and peaceful he felt during the album's creation in turn makes me feel happy and peaceful when listening to the album.  Happiness never decreases when we share it with others.  In addition to reflecting a mood of happiness, contentment, peace, and joy, many of the songs also have a very optimistic thread to them, with the message that if you keep your chin up, don't lose hope, and keep smiling, eventually such good things will come to you too, even if you feel as though life and love are passing you by and happen to everyone but you.  And for being put out in 1979 (the year of my birth), it doesn't really have a really obvious stamp of the era on it.  Most people associate the late Seventies with arena rock, disco, and early New Wave, whereas these songs have more of a timeless feel to them.<br /><br />The album starts off with the very catchy, joyous, and optimistic \\"Love Comes to Everyone,\\" which really sets the mood for the entire album.  There couldn't have been a more perfect opening track chosen.  \\"Not Guilty,\\" though a leftover from over 10 years ago, is quite good and fits in very well with the other songs.  It's hard to believe it was rejected as a White Album track considering some of the tracks that were left on, such as \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\\"  \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" is obviously a sequel to \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" and while not quite as perfect as that, still conveys a really mystical dreamlike playful mood.  It's one song sequel that actually works.  \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" is really fun and laidback, and finding out it was inspired by an experience in Maui with psychedelic mushrooms really helps to explain the rather strange lyrics.  It's followed by the album's big hit \\"Blow Away,\\" with its downright catchy, cheerful, and optimistic lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Faster,\\" inspired by and dedicated to the Formula One racing circus, is another fun catchy number, full of great hooks and musical energy.  \\"Dark Sweet Lady,\\" inspired by George's new wife Olivia, might not be at the same masterful level as a love song like \\"Something,\\" but it's very genuine, heartfelt, and sweet.  It kind of reminds me of his earlier song \\"If Not for You.\\"  \\"Your Love Is Forever,\\" one of my favorite songs on the album, is also very heartfelt and beautiful, the perfect musical picture of just how happy and fulfilled he was with his new family.  \\"Soft Touch,\\" about his new son Dhani, is yet another sweet heartfelt song about the joys he had in his domestic life.  What new father wouldn't feel his heart melting when looking at his new baby, particularly when he'd had to wait till the age of 35 to have kids?  After waiting that long, you tend to love and appreciate that new special bond between parent and child even more than if you'd had kids at a younger age.  \\"If You Believe\\" is the perfect album closer, really summing up the mood of joyful optimism and good things coming to good people if they just keep up hope and wait long enough.<br /><br />Obviously nothing could ever compare to ATMP, but I'd say that apart from that unique album in a class all by itself, this is definitely one of George's strongest and best solo albums.considering some of the tracks that were left on, such as \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\\"  \\"Here Comes the Moon\\" is obviously a sequel to \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" and while not quite as perfect as that, still conveys a really mystical dreamlike playful mood.

B0000524CY|5.0|Movies do a lot of things to scare people these days, most of which involve quick, loud music, something coming out of the dark corner unexpectedly, and then finishing with torrents of spraying, splattering blood. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But here's how horror movies never start: a sandswept mideastern wasteland, an old pill-popping priest, and an inexplicably creepy statue silhouetted against a dusky sun with dogs fighting in the foreground.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST is frightening in ways movies had never been before and have never been since, although many have tried to duplicate its inimitable horror.<br /><br />The setup works like this: a twelve year old girl (played by Linda Blair in one of the most brilliant and controversial performances in horror movie history), estranged from her father, lives instead in Georgetown with her actress mother. And they're happy--until Satan possess the child, which kind of ruins everything ... Enter the priests: one young, one old; one an educated but disillusioned psychiatrist, the other an old warrior of exorcism. Add a homicide cop. And hold onto your [...] for the scariest movie ever made.<br /><br />If you've seen it, you don't need anyone to rehash the details, and if you haven't, then you would not want me to ruin it. So I won't. But let me just add this note to today's horror movie makers--you can spring out at your audience with a hockey-masked man and a chainsaw, hoping to make your audience scream, but you'll never achieve that split second of soul-rending, into-the-abyss-staring moment of terror Friedkin impaled on his moviegoers when he flashed the not-quite-subliminal face of the devil into the random dream images of Father Karras. Thanks for trying, though.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")

All I can say is that this book was just as good and it was well worth the read. It's breathes life into a country that is very remote from the USA, both in distance and culture. The characters in this book were fully drawn out and richly developed. I found myself caring about them and wondering as the story moved on just what might happen to them. In summary I enjoyed the story and I thought it was just a wonderful novel.

Behind me an elderly lady begins to cry into her sleeve and I am over come. I too begin to sob. Huge racking waves of hysteria flood out of my body and my cheeks are wet from thick torrents of hot tears.<br />Here is where you need to pay attention and understand...<br />I am crying because this was the most ridiculous, useless, pointless, unemotional, waste of time and space, movie I have ever seen.<br />I am not going to tell you play by play of why, or what could have been done... or maybe it was an editing thing.

In order to be successful, each soldier would have to kill 3,333 and 1/3 of another warrior to win. I particularly like this movie because of how crazy you would have to be to defy Xerxe's army. I wish I could say, \\"I would rather die than be a slave.\\" But, I can't because I'm a slave in this world and this statement is quite opposite. I would rather become a slave than die.

But what is more amazing is the brutally honest self-discovery that she shares which coincides with her travels.  At times this book is laugh-out-loud funny and and other times it is heart breaking.  My only complaint is that at times she will go on for pages about the history or factual information that reads more like an encyclopedia or history book.  Not that the history is not interesting, but I found the real meat of the book to be her personal thoughts and dialogue with the many characters that she meets.

0753820250|5.0|The \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" follows a young boy, Daniel Sempere, on his captivating journey through life. The novel begins just at the end of the Spanish Civil War. Zafon instantly let's the reader inside Daniel's head to let the audience know what he is thinking. Daniel is worried because he cannot remember what his deceased mother looked like. Seeing Daniel's anguish, his father decides to take him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, in efforts to cheer him up. Whoever enters this place is required to take one book from it, and protect that book for as long as the protector may live. Upon entering the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, Daniel wanders around looking for the book that will be his. Upon seeing Julian Carax's \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", Daniel knows he has found his book. However, Daniel does not know what he has gotten himself into, the novel and author he has chosen has a lot of history behind it. Throughout the rest of the novel Daniel discovers the dangerous history behind the book he has chosen, and sworn to protect. Along the way Daniel picks up a homeless man that becomes his best friend, and a beautiful older girl who is engaged to a soldier. Both of Daniel's new friends not only help him discover the mystery behind his book, but also add to it.<br /> Although it is a long book, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a quick read due to its captivating plot and the author's ability to make the reader want to keep reading. The author takes advantage of using what was socially accepted back in the 1940s as a catalyst for the story. Also, Zafon does a good job with both of Daniel's love interests throughout the story.<br /> While I highly recommend this novel, like everything else it has its flaws. For one, the author is so descriptive and the novel is so long that it is hard to keep track of all the characters and their characteristics. Some characters may not be mentioned for 300 pages and by the time you read about them again it is hard to remember who they are. My biggest regret is having to stop reading and searching through the book to see when a character was introduced just so I can re-familiarize myself with him or her. I feel as if the book would have served its purpose better if it had been around a 300-400 page novel. Also, I would have been more satisfied if my favorite sub-plot, like between Daniel and his love interest Bea and Daniel and his homeless companion Fermin were explored further.<br /> However, overall \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a novel I strongly suggest for all readers.st regret is having to stop reading and searching through the book to see when a character was introduced just so I can re-familiarize myself with him or her.

I'll be very, very, very much more simple like them: 300  deserves five stars, even a sixth, because it's an spectacular MOVIE. It's more than obvious that the production is one of the best-invested made in the History of cinema. There's a lot of movies which have been more expensive and they are awful movies. 300 is a great piece in any movie collection. You won't loose your money.

But, scandals lead him to isolation, to public ridicule or upbraiding, which led him to sequester himself to his 200-bedroom hermitage-castle.

That book does a good job tracing the history of this brand of metaphysical thinking back to the 19th century. It is a compelling look at what science has to do with what Toile is talking about as well. The LOA, metaphysics, it really all comes from the same roots - and taken the same route.
B00005JPLW|5.0|First, I loved the movie in the theatre so much I saw it twice, so I wanted the DVD to see the behind-the-scenes commentaries and featurettes.  This DVD did not disappoint.  It was full of actor interviews and special features on how the whole production came together which deserves Academy Award recognition for creativity at the very least.  I was amazed at the Frank Miller's amazing vision and how he created this cinema production and CGI effects which tricks our eyes into seeing a much greater scope of bigger-than-life action and scenery.  I adore Gerard Butler's expressive voice and eyes and how he commands the story with his convincing role as King Leonidas.  Plus, all the actors/Spartans warriors' physiques are the real deal!  Watch the special feature on the bodybuilding and how the actors had to learn real fighting techniques and over 6 months of grueling physical training to get into those little leather loincloths--of course, well worth the result when you watch the fight sequences.  Of course, the movie has its legend bending qualities, but the point of entertainment is to leave some of that skeptical sense of Discovery Channel accuracy/fact checking at the door and sit down and just enjoy the show.  So just do it.  It's worth the money and then some!!
B00005JLCI|5.0|Everything about this film adaptation of Hamlet is superb. Everything.<br /><br />I cannot add much to the glowing reviews already posted here, but the sets, casting, and cinematography are all of the highest order. The cast is deep and the performances are nearly flawless. Some have taken issue with Branagh's interpretation of the lead character, expressing annoyance at his \\"over acting\\" and \\"over the top\\" performance. True, his is not an ordinary Hamlet. He broods and is often shown as a slave to his explosive passions and bouts of ill-natured silliness. His, I believe, is an honest portrayal of a deeply affected man--one who has eschewed dignity as an unnecessary appendage in pursuit of revenge and his idea of justice.<br /><br />The film is four hours long, but it is a quick four hours. It never drags and every scene is so well produced and acted that it seems essential--as if the plot hinges on that small piece of dialogue or confrontation.<br /><br />Some of the casting may leave some scratching their heads. Robin Williams as Osric? Billy Crystal as the grave digger? Rest assured, they play their roles well, Crystal in particular. His is one of the most enjoyable scenes in the film and his interaction with Branagh is a highlight.<br /><br />Aside from the fine performances, this is a beautiful film. While I was watching the DVD, my wife walked in and immediately said (direct quote) \\"Wow, this is a high quality movie.\\" This is from someone who couldn't care less about SD vs. HD or any video quality issues whatsoever. The excellent 70mm cinematography makes this film shine.<br /><br />I simply cannot recommend any movie or DVD more highly than this.

The young man finally convinces her to go on an evening picnic and they see a shooting star, Tristan promises to retrieve the shooting star for her as a birthday gift the following week. If he delivers, she must marry him instead. She is intrigued and agrees to wait. Tristan sets off and prepares to cross the wall into the next county, but the wall is a barrier into a different world and he soon finds himself in a strange village called Stormhold. Arriving at the site of the falling star, he finds Yvaine (Claire Danes). An old witch, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her two sisters spot the falling star as well; a falling star can help them retain their beauty and youth, prompting Lamia to search Yvaine out. The King of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole) is dying and summons his remaining living sons. The sons are so greedy, they are happy to kill of their brothers to become king. Soon, it is a battle between Septimus (Mark Strong) and Primus (Jason Flemyng). But they are also looking for Yvaine, as she has a piece of jewelry that the king must have in order to rule the land. Along the way, Tristan and Yvaine meet Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro) the captain of a flying ship, with the requisite cast of pirates, who agrees to help them.<br /><br />Who decided Matthew Vaughn (\\"LayerCake\\") would be a good choice to direct this strange and unusual fantasy film? I would like to congratulate them. Vaughn, who has also been the producer on some Guy Ritchie films, seems a very odd choice for this material, but he proves to be a great choice, taking the various recognizable fantasy elements and combining them together in a strange and unusual way. \\"Stardust\\" almost never goes where you might expect, and if it does occasionally go to an expected place, it takes a circuitous route to get there or does something unusual once it is there. The director and screenwriters receive a lot of credit for adapting the original work written by Neil Gaiman and creating something a little bit wonderful, unusual and interesting, providing a surprise for the summer.<br /><br />The look of the film is also enchanting. It looks like a picture book about faeries and witches come to life. There are a lot of special effects throughout, there would have to be to create this strange world and all of the inhabitants, but they seem to blend better than many recent CGI extravaganzas. The kingdom of Stormhold is the most telling example of the use of special effects, but even this is remarkably well done. Any time a huge structure rises out of a mountain, your mind immediately says special effect. But this structure is interesting and there are elements added to it that make it seem more lifelike. For instance, as the camera pans across the length of the tower, we occasionally see people in the windows.<br /><br />The use of magic, the site of a falling star, the transformation of beasts are all handled well and serve to further pull us into this mystical world.<br /><br />I have never been a huge fan of Claire Danes. I just have never seen what the big thrill is about her; yes she's pretty, but she seems to be fairly one note when she is acting on screen. Make that three note; she has three facial expressions, blank, happy and sad. Nothing in between. The blank facial expression seems to stand in for a lot of other facial expressions. But it just makes her a boring actress. In \\"Stardust\\", this seems to work for her a little. Yvaine is a fallen star, so she is naturally a little awkward and unsure of how to act on Earth and her lack of expression lends itself well to this creature finding her way in a new world.<br /><br />Charlie Cox is very charming as Tristan, the young man who is guided by his emotions. Throughout the film, his character has the greatest arc and shows the most change. He is very tentative at first, shy around the village beauty, but he soon realizes he has to act for her love, or will lose her forever. This realization causes him to promise her the fallen star and he begins a journey changing him into a dashing hero.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer is the real standout in the film. She plays Lamia, a 400-year-old witch. When she and her sisters spot the falling star, they hatch a plan. If they can capture the falling star, and sacrifice it, they will become young and beautiful again. Lamia uses the little magic they have left and transforms herself into a young, beautiful woman and sets out to capture Yvaine. Throughout, we get glimpses of the desperation and vanity leading this witch on the hunt.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro is also good as Captain Shakespeare, the captain of a flying pirate ship. Full of bravado, he takes Yvaine and Tristan on his ship, and tries to help them. He realizes they are kind and feels ready to share a secret with them. This is a nice, funny moment leading to another nice, funny moment with the rest of his crew.<br /><br />Ricky Gervais has a small role as a con man and he is amusing. But the role is too brief and doesn't really add to the overall fabric of the film.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole has a small, but memorable role as the King of Stormhold. As soon as he dies, his sons set about trying to take over the throne. How do they do this? By killing each other off and the King seems to relish in lending a hand. As soon as one dies, they become a ghost and join the rest of the brothers, forming a sort of Greek chorus. Rupert Everett plays one of the sons, who quickly meets his maker, and joins the other dead heirs. Then it becomes a battle between Septimus (Mark Strong) and Primus (Jason Flemyng) as they search out Yvaine, all the while trying to battle each other.<br /><br />There is, of course, a big battle when Tristan must save Yvaine from Lamia and various other characters. Even during this scene, director Vaughn throws some other characters into the mix and adds some interesting elements. I am making it seem fairly haphazard, but everything connects and works well together.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is a surprising, enchanting film. It is also flopping at the box office.

B000IJ79WU|2.0|CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS NECESSARY TO COMPARE/CONTRAST TWO VERSIONS     When considering the value of The Donner Cut, when compared to [[ASIN:B000IJ79V6 Superman II (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], two major issues arise.     Issue A: the controversial decisions behind the movie's production...i.e. the change of director, dissent among cast and crew, cutting Brando, script re-writes, etc.     Issue B: the end results of said decisions, which was initially the theatrical version but now includes this alternative...i.e. which movie tells which part of the story more effectively.     I see little sense in mixing these issues, since an objective view of the two versions (Issue B) becomes clouded when considering the facts (and speculations) of the movie's production (Issue A). In other words, I believe it is more important to look at the two movies for what they actually are, both strengths and weaknesses - NOT what anyone might claim 'could've been/should've been,' based on the differing accounts of the troubled production.     Full disclosure: I am an unapologetic fan of the theatrical release of \\"Superman II.\\" I loved it as a kid, and I still consider it my favorite Superman movie to this day. Over the years, through repeat viewings, I have come to see some flaws in the storytelling but nothing that significantly altered my appreciation of the movie. Of course, I also became aware of the backstory of the making of the film and was intrigued by the personnel changes (key among them, of course, the firing of Donner).     I have to admit I was hesistant to even watch this so-called Donner Cut. There seems to be an awful lot of group-think regarding \\"Superman II.\\" Many of the supposed flaws of the theatrical cut - often attributed to Richard Lester - have never made much sense to me. Along with the Salkinds, Lester has obviously become vilified as a bumbling hack by a large portion of the fanbase, while Donner has been elevated to something approaching visionary genious. An objective look at their filmographies reveals Lester as the more influential and distinguished filmmaker, while Donner is more a director-for-hire without any discernable style. Take that for what it's worth, as it doesn't necessarily make either director's vision of \\"Superman\\" more valid. I only mention it as a rebuttal for those who are under the impression that a 'great artist' was replaced by a 'talentless automaton.' If Richard Donner is, as seems to be a frequent claim, a great visionary - where in his catalog of films is this apparent (other than, arguably, \\"Superman: The Movie\\")?     Having listened to Donner's commentary on the Donner Cut, as well as the Salkind/Spengler commentary on the theatrical version, I see no reason to 'choose sides' over the change-in-directors decision. True, Donner did an excellent job with the first film and doesn't seem to be any apparent reason his sequel wouldn't have been excellent as well. True, Donner seems unwilling to admit any wrongdoing regarding his behavior and working relationships on the production. But it is just as true that the producers feel justified in the decision to replace him. The point is, we'll never know who was \\"right\\" - that type of 'truth' is usually so subjective that even the parties directly involved aren't necessarily right or wrong. Filmmaking is a collaborative business, and the money-men are going to say who continues to work on a given project and who does not. Maybe Donner was hell to work with, maybe he wasn't - we, the viewers, are not privy to what actually transpired. That is all part of the aforementioned Issue A...     ...bringing me to Issue B: which version is better? The one clear benefit of the Donner Cut is the inclusion of the Brando scenes - it is stronger than the theatrical version's Susannah York scenes. I think that Kal-El interacting with Jor-El makes more sense in the context of the first film than having him talk to his mother. Seeing how Kal-El's powers are restored is better storytelling than having him simply reappear in Metropolis at full-strength, as he does in the thearical version. This is the biggest problem with the theatrical version. Of course, going back to Issue A momentarily, it should be understood that Richard Lester did not choose to remove Brando - the producers did. Why? Certainly not to sabotage Donner's work, but rather they were doing exactly what good producer's do: maximize profits. Paying Brando was going to cost millions of dollars, yet the producers realized that the movie's success was pretty much a given with or without him. But back to Issue B, finishing the Jor-El story arc makes more sense than having him MIA while Superman works things out with his mother. The strength of the Brando footage is the only clear-cut example of the Donner Cut trumping the theatrical cut.     That's largely because the Donner Cut is not a finished movie. There is a fairly considerable amount of Lester-directed footage still present, since the story couldn't be told without the inclusion of at least some of the theatrical cut. I happen to like seeing more of the villians in East Houston, Idaho - much of which has been edited out. I much prefer the Niagara Falls scenes - including Lois in the river, as well as the hand-in-the-fire reveal - to what is found in the Donner Cut. Why would I want to watch early test footage that looks like it came from an entirely different movie? Sure, there wasn't anything else available (for reasons pertaining to Issue A) but the bottom line is that it doesn't look good nor does it play well. Reeve and Kidder hadn't fully arrived at their characterizations as would be seen in the actual movie. From a visual standpoint, it is perfunctorily staged (at best) as it wasn't meant to be included in a final movie. The theatrical version, on the other hand, presents a much better realized scene. And I know I'm skipping around at this point, but losing the Eiffel Tower sequence is shows a major weaknessin the original conception. Freeing the villians as a result of the bomb from the first movie isn't exciting - we're watching rehashed flashback footage from the first film as the villians are released. The theatrical version presents an entirely reimagined - and infinitely more engaging - set of circumstances that allows us to see Superman in action much earlier in the film, while providing the same reason for the villians' release.     As explained in the supplementary materials, Superman turning back time was originally planned as the ending for \\"Superman II.\\" It was used, of course, as the ending of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" - so re-using it in the Donner Cut is simply a way inserting something because no ending had been conceived by Donner and Co. There's no ending to the Donner Cut because the \\"ending\\" we see would have never been used even if Donner had been allowed to finish the movie. There's no reason to even speculate how Donner's finished \\"Superman II\\" would have ended, since it has never existed. Watching the Donner Cut - even as a stand-alone movie - results in terrible disappointment, because turning back time to the very beginning of the movie renders everything we just watched meaningless. It's a variation on the old grade school creative writing cliche \\"it was all just a dream.\\" In order to make Lois forget that Clark is Superman, the clock is turned back and the whole story we watched was erased. It's a cheat, and it's simply bad storytelling. It also underlines in bold-face that what we have watched is merely a collection of alternate scenes strung together with segments from an actual finished film spliced in to approximate the experience of watching a full movie. The alternate footage is interesting, but ultimately doesn't come close to supplanting the theatrical release.
B00005JPUN|2.0|\\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\".... Er, \\"The Invasion\\", the second remake of the popular, iconic Science Fiction film, is not a bad film. It is just a very familiar film. It does manage to create some good thrills and it sets the story against the backdrop of our current political climate in an unusual way, giving it a little more interest than the tired material has any right to generate.<br /><br />A shuttle burns up upon reentry causing debris to land across a wide swath of the United States. Tucker Kaufman (Jeremy Northam), a member of the CDC, visits one of the crash sites and gets a cut on his hand. Dr. Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman) notices people starting to act strange and turns to her best friend, Dr. Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig). He takes a small sample of the material to a friend of his, Dr. Stephen Galeano (Jeffrey Wright) and they soon learn the substance is not of this Earth. Carol's son, Oliver (Jackson Bond) is also having nightmares and Carol thinks it is because he is about to start spending time with his father, Tucker, who has recently returned from Atlanta. But Tucker is one of the first infected and starts acting weird, showing little emotion. One of Carol's patients (Veronica Cartwright, who appeared in the 1978 version of the film) complains that her husband is acting differently; they no longer fight and she claims he is no longer her husband. As she begins to voice these concerns, Carol begins to notice other strange things; people are staring at her as she walks by, no one shows any emotion when a car hits a woman. Carol soon realizes she must stay awake, find her son, and join her two friends as they try to get to Fort Dix and work on an antidote.<br /><br />Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel (\\"Downfall\\"), with an apparent assist from the Wachowski Brothers (\\"The Matrix\\" trilogy, more on that later), \\"The Invasion\\" does a fairly good job of setting up the story; the shuttle explosion allows the wreckage to land in a wide area covering approximately 200 miles, exposing millions to the infection. The alien material is on the pieces of the shuttle and as soon as someone touches a piece of the wreckage, they become infected. Naturally, they then infect others. And so on and so forth. As these infected people become more prominent, they become bolder and take less precaution in the next stages of their plans. When they become more prominent, become the majority, they have no reason to try to cover up and simply start grabbing people off the street.<br /><br />The director does a good job of setting up Carol's universe and using that as an indicator of the state of the Invasion. One day, as Carol walks into her office building, she notices certain things, the next day, they are different. But we get the idea that she is used to the things she noticed in the first way, so when they are different, even though they don't appear that different, she notices. And they seem strange to her, startling her, causing her to start to look at everything with new, critical eyes.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion\\" borrows many of the key elements that made the first two films so successful. And they continue to work in this new version. In order to move among the infected undetected, Carol learns she must show no emotion. So, as she walks through large crowds, and they watch a couple commit suicide, a woman standing near Carol screams at the sight. As Carol moves away, the infected round up the emotional woman and prepare to convert her.<br /><br />There are nice touches included throughout. As Carol learns specific things about the invasion, these elements are used to create little moments of suspense only the audience knows about. Because we are in on the information, when the character in question is not, we feel a bigger part of the action. It is an old idea that Hitchcock perfected. Hirschbegel is no Hitchcock, but he gives it a game try.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion\\" is a film that should not have been released in the summer. Expectations are too high during this period and if any release doesn't make at least $50 million in its opening weekend, it is a flop, which is a crazy illustration of how excessive this industry has become. Apparently, someone decided the film was a little too low key for their liking and producer Joel Silver called in the Wachowski Brothers to do a rewrite and reshoot some scenes. From what I understand, they redid the car chases in the film. And they are impressively shot, but they don't really need to be that impressive for this film. \\"The Invasion\\" would be a much more successful film if it stuck to the task of building tension rather than orchestrating car chases. If \\"The Invasion\\" were released in the fall, it would probably have been able to maintain the original feel and tone. It might have been a much better film for it.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays the Kevin McCarthy/ Donald Sutherland role. As psychiatrist Dr. Carol Bennell, she is a bit aloof and emotionally unattached to the rest of the characters. She is the type of mother who, because of her job, tries to interpret her son's nightmares. She also can't get too attached to Ben, because she can't lose her best friend. Really, she doesn't want to have the emotional attachment, and deal with the possibility of losing that. As she becomes enmeshed in the crisis, she makes smart decisions and stays just slightly ahead of the infected.<br /><br />I find it odd that Nicole Kidman has almost made a career of playing emotionally unattached women. Every role she plays, with a few exceptions, is emotionally aloof, manipulative or conniving, or simply crazy and can't show any genuine emotion. In some of her films, this type of thing works. In others, it doesn't. This type of performance doesn't serve her particularly well in \\"The Invasion\\"; it would be nice to see her show some emotion to offset those moments when she is unable to do so, trying to fly under the radar of the aliens.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a bit one-dimensional, little more than a sidekick to Carol. When she needs muscle, he provides it. When she needs something, he is there to provide it. He is even unable to provide her with the medical information she needs; he has to take that to a friend of his, for analysis. It seems strange that they didn't make him a different type of doctor and allow him to provide this important piece of the puzzle. As it is, he is simply Carol's frustrated boy toy.<br /><br />Jeffrey Wright plays the doctor with the information about the infectious agent and Jeremy Northam plays Carol's ex-husband and the man who is largely responsible for spreading the invasion throughout the United States. And then the world. Both are good, but unspectacular and not very memorable.<br /><br />Set in \\"Present Day\\", \\"The Invasion\\" shows the effect of the aliens taking over our minds and bodies giving the story a unique, timely slant. It is a nice touch, giving the film just a touch of political conscience and giving us just a bit of a political message.<br /><br />\\"The Invasion\\" has enough going for it that it would definitely make a suitable DVD rental. But it is such a familiar story and executed in a familiar way that you will not have enough surprises to warrant the time and money of a trip to the local multiplex.any release doesn't make at least $50 million in its opening weekend, it is a flop, which is a crazy illustration of how excessive this industry has become.

The other criticisms were of the tedious recounting of the intense training required to become a Navy Seal.  The book explains how the rigors of their training narrowed them down to a select few.  That training proved itself in their unbelievable courage and tenacity on Murphy's Ridge.  If this book were fiction, you would not believe it.  These men did things and performed acts of heroism most of us can only dream about.  Throughout the book Marcus discusses his ethos - Duty, Honor, Country.  The reason the detractors belittle this is they have no such belief system themselves and are unable to comprehend those who do.  I do believe Marcus was spared to share this incredible story with us to reinforce our faith in our people and to bolster our resolve.  This book should be required reading of every American.  God bless Marcus and his fellow comrades.
B00005JPRZ|3.0|\\"Death at a Funeral\\", the new film from director Frank Oz (\\"In and Out\\", Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\\") is a pretty good tribute to the British comedies we used to see with more consistency. A droll, black sense of humor, characters who are as wacky as others are steadfast and the use of a setting we are all familiar with used in an unfamiliar way all help to give this film a whacked out sensibility. But it isn't above moments of crass, bathroom humor and these bring it down.<br /><br />Daniel (Matthew McFadyen, TV's \\"MI:5\\", \\"Pride & Prejudice\\") and his wife, Jane (Keely Hawes, TV's \\"MI:5\\") are living at home with his father and mother when his father dies. They await the arrival of the rest of the family for the funeral. Soon, the house is filled and they have to deal with all of the craziness in everyone's life. Daniel's brother, John (Rupert Graves), a published writer, flies in from New York, first class, and claims he doesn't have any money to help out with the funeral costs. Martha (Daisy Donovan), Daniel's cousin, and her fianc&eacute;e, Simon (Alan Tudyk) stop by to pick up her brother, Troy (Kris Marshall, \\"Love Actually\\"). Simon is a wreck, because Martha's father has never liked him, so Martha decides to give him a Valium she finds in Troy's apartment. The only problem is that Troy is a minor drug dealer and the Valium is in fact a hallucinogen. Then, Peter (Peter Dinklage, \\"The Station Agent\\") shows up for the service. Daniel doesn't recognize him and is surprised when he asks if they can speak alone.  Peter reveals some information to the son of the deceased, which causes everything to spiral out of control.<br /><br />Directed by Frank Oz, an American director and former Muppeteer, \\"Death at a Funeral\\" has all the markings on a dark British comedy. It is strange that an American film director would make such a film, but Oz seems to be a good choice; \\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\\" has many similar elements. Despite the broad moments in his comedies, they do share a certain sensibility with the early work or Peter Sellers or Alec Guiness. In \\"Death\\", Oz dials down the comedy significantly, making it darker, more subtle, more tongue in cheek, more British.<br /><br />The mood of the film is set early on. The undertakers arrive with Daniel's father and set the coffin in the viewing room. They open the casket and Daniel looks inside. \\"Who's that? That's not my father.\\" They have brought the wrong body. They take the casket away and return later with the right body.<br /><br />The real comedic standout in the film is Alan Tudyk who plays Simon, Martha's nervous fianc&eacute;e. Just as they arrive at the country estate, the drugs he has unwittingly ingested begin to take hold and he starts to stare at leaves and flowers. Martha doesn't really know what to make of her boyfriend. During the ceremony, he causes a delay and Martha's father, Victor, dislikes him even more. Through the course of the film, Simon becomes more distraught and more unhinged as the full effects of the drug take place.<br /><br />Simon is the broadest character, but even this is minor when compared to some comedic roles in American films. The major laughs of this character come from his actions in the environment of this country house funeral. Everyone else is trying to remain very proper and respectful as Simon climbs naked on roofs.<br /><br />Matthew McFadyen and Keely Hawes are both good, but they are basically the straight men for the rest of the cast. Daniel and Jane are trying to maintain an air of respectability, and Daniel's known as the `respectable' (boring) son. When Peter makes himself known to Daniel, Daniel begins to act a bit wacky, but the role is still relatively low key.<br /><br />As the story progresses and the characters begin to spiral out of control, the action becomes even more funny because people are acting completely at odds to the setting. When you see a large country house in the English countryside, you think everyone will be acting very proper. When they don't, it creates funny situations and a lot of laugher. This is really the key with most great British comedies. They make fun of themselves, planting tongue firmly in cheek and casting their eye on themselves.<br /><br />\\"Death at a Funeral\\" is not a great film. It can't seem to distance itself from scatological humor; an elderly wheelchair bound Uncle (Peter Vaughn) needs help to get to the bathroom and a family friend Howard (Andy Nyman) seems designated to help him. The situation leads to Howard getting feces on his hand and face. Oz seems to think this is funny, but it is just gross and seems completely at odds with the rest of the film.<br /><br />\\"Death at a Funeral\\" is not a laugh a minute, but is a very humorous and enjoyable diversion.

Strange...)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000UR9TQO Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains the Same (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />What I'm about to say has already been said, but I'd like a chance to say it, too.<br /><br />For starters, this is a major upgrade.  My first impression in watching this would have to be:<br /><br />\\"Jonesy can be heard!\\"<br /><br />I think the most criminal aspect of the original release was that Jonesy was non-existent.  Even when he played the keyboards, you could only hear him if he was the only one playing.  As soon as Page came in, Jonesy was gone.  Hence, No Quarter just didn't sound that great.  But now, Jonesy is there in all his glory.  The bass can be heard quite well.  The keyboards can be heard.  Same is true also for the drums.  In the old footage, you got a lot of cymbal and snare and even a little high-tom, but you couldn't hear any of Bonzo's bass or low-toms.  Basically, in the old footage, it was all treble and no bass.  Now the mix is perfect, and the balance between treble and bass is perfect.<br /><br />I also love the footage itself.  I am probably one of the rare Led Zeppelin fans who loves the fantasy/movie sequences.  The only sequence I think is rather stupid is Robert's.  It's cliche, sappy, and really just un-creative.  I would have hoped Robert could have come up with something more thought-provoking and imaginative.  I love Jimmy's different sequences, especially his main one, climbing up the mountain to the wizard, and Jonesy's sequence is really cool.  Bonzo's is the only other cliche one, but at least it isn't sappy.<br /><br />The special features, to me, are really neat.  Though I admittedly can't understand this whole idea of legal issues that prevented them from tampering with THEIR MOVIE (caps for emphasis, not yelling :D).  I would have liked to see the songs put in their original running order.  Also, the exclusion of Thank You from the last night (I have the bootlegs, and it's a very good rendition) makes me kinda sad.<br /><br />Now, onto the extra stuff:<br /><br />The t-shirt is fine.  It's size is mis-labeled, but it isn't that small.  Trust me.  I'm 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, and I'm ashamed to admit that muscle comprises only a small percentage of that (something I am working on).  But the shirt fits me perfectly.  When you get this set, do NOT expect an extra large.  This shirt is no bigger than a large.  Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to the poster, which I've already sent in for.  I love the pictures and the tickets, and even the paper article.  My only problems with these extras is that the only reviews they include are negative reviews.  Come on!  You can't tell me there wasn't one positive review of this movie when it came out.  You can't.<br /><br />Now, I have listed some things that bother me, but I give this five stars because I love it, and because, in the end, I'm quite satisfied with what I got.  Ignore the nay-sayers, because they are not Led Zeppelin fans.  I have the majority of Led Zeppelin live recordings in existence, including studio sessions and all of their official releases (except for Mothership, which I'm still debating over).  I can tell you this is definitely a good performance from Zep.  It's no where near one of their best, but it's so far from their worst it's ridiculous.  This set is worth it.  Thank you, Led Zeppelin.Now, onto the extra stuff:    The t-shirt is fine.  It's size is mis-labeled, but it isn't that small.  Trust me.

B000C8Q97S|4.0|To begin with, I would probably be on the right of the political spectrum and have no problem with multi-national business or globalisation.  So, when I say that I liked the film in which the hero was a left-wing activist and the baddies were the multi-national company I hope that lets you know the movie actually tells a good story and is not the latest Al Gore political propaganda movie.  It is a thriller with a touch of romance; and a well written one at that.    The girl activist in question is married to a minor diplomat in Africa who looks after gardening (hence the title).  She delves too far into what a drug company is doing in Africa and gets killed because of what she knows and is threatening to expose.  Her husband, who up until then liked to stay out of her work to pursue his more mild manner diplomatic work, then follows the clues to unravel the mystery involved in his wife's death.  In the process he finds out just how faithfully his wife really did love him. I won't expose the ending, but it tells a real story with all the twists and suspence that makes for good story telling.      The footage is great as it was all filmed here in Kenya with locals playing minor roles.  I watched it with my wife and we both really enjoyed it.
1400063515|5.0|I thought that I will get a book on chance or probability, but I found out that I have an autobiography written in an attempt to understand ones self and life path.<br /><br />The idea of the black swan is very intersting, and to me it has alot of truth. It is interesting to note from reading the book that the authors life story is filled with black swans. If it was not for a back swan success in the financial markets the author himself might not have been able to afford to live as he says he leads in his book.<br /><br />As I read the book, Taleb makes you feel as if you are his best friend and that he is confiding in you to tell you what he thinks of life and people. I also felt at time as if I was his psychotherapist and he was expressing his frustration and hidden agressions towards certain prototypes of people that he is not fond of. Interestingly...he criticizes or so I understood empty suites and social climbers but yet he associates with alot of them as apparent in the multitiude of stories he presents.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is mind opening book on philosiphy...yet written in a very interesting \\" I want to open up to you\\" fashion. The author really succeeds as branding his own style of writing.<br /><br />After reading this book I am inclined to categorize NNT as he refers to himself in one par of his book as a philosipher of the \\" people philosipher\\" brand.<br /><br />Having the book on CDs is a brilliant idea as the author makes it quite easy to read the book in todays very busy life.<br /><br />In conclusion...A GREAT & UNIQUE BOOK
1416523359|2.0|A couple of times I've been ready to just put this thing down and walk away, it's that painful.  But as a long-time SK fan, I feel obliged to at least finish it.  It's been a while since I read a SK novel, gone are the days of a new one coming out each year, so perhaps I've changed and no longer have the patience for his style.  But I just find the constant \\"smuckings\\" and little internal \\"stop that thought Lisey!\\" bits irritating, and, perhaps more importantly, unrealistic.  He manages to keep my attention for some time because of the whole \\"what's going on?\\" question -- I need to keep reading to find out the mysterious bit (NOT the scary bit).  But information needs to be doled out regularly or I grow impatient, just as I have with \\"Lost\\" on TV.  Anyway, to summarize: irritating, not scary, don't bother.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|This 3rd movie is a great addition to the collection ! I wasn't a huge fan but made me consider buying the other released movies soon !
031236198X|5.0|This book is an excellent and powerful message to understand and manage change especially in turbulent times of the current century. Prof Kotter's earlier books on the theory of understanding and managing change might appear a little overwhelming for an ordinary reader. This book fills the void since the entire concept and framework is brought out in the form of a simple and interesting story of a colony of penguins residing on an iceberg oblivious of the fact that their home is actually melting. If they do nothing about it, their sweet and comfortable home for decades could soon break into pieces and all of them would be easy prey for their predators in the icy waters of Antarctica. The book certainly deserves praise for taking this situation forward and to bring it to a happy ending where the penguins learn to migrate to newer and safer icebergs, using the eight step framework of change.    However, we need to ask a broader question on the root cause of why the iceberg is melting in the first place. While it is a good setting to narrate a story around penguins, the point is that we humans are responsible for the irresponsible plundering of earth's natural resources that has led to global warming. In the story of penguins, the colony migrates to another iceberg. Does this mean that we humans should, taking the analogy further, prepare ourselves to migrate to another planet? My point is that Prof Kotter should now look deeper into the question of \\"Why change if we collectively behave well?\\" One needs to embrace change caused by technology, globalization and the better aspects of progress. But if change, especially the kind that is painful and tragic in nature is caused by human wrongdoings and the sufferers are a totally different section of society or a continent, Prof Kotter's current prescription and methodology may not work.    Despite these comments, this book deserves a 5 Star rating for what it intends to convey.

B000NA28I4|1.0|How could Jeremy Irons sink to this level?  How could John Malkovich perform in this piece of dreck?  In fact Malkovich overacts to the point you begin to wonder if he wasn't trying to turn this into a comedy.  The lead character -- Eragon -- is a simpleton played by an actor whose only claim to fame must be his relationship with the director because it certainly isn't his acting.  He merely poses and looks handsome throughout the film.  Jeremy Irons does try to act but then to act you must have a script, which is sorely lacking here.  Like most current films the personal hygiene is subpar and seems to be used as a gauge for evil.  There are hordes of bad guys all of whom are suitably ugly and look like what's left over from Middle Earth.  There was a Dragon in this film which seemed to be the only point of making the film.  This is a film that should come with a warning label for bad acting and writing.

0060523808|4.0|When I started the book, I have no idea about the history of IBM. I am not an IT person, so I have heard IBM but that is basically it.   I learned a lot from the book about IBM, what they did wrong and how he changed it.  But besides everything he revised the company culture and organizational structure. I think that is the hardest thing a CEO can achieve. His vision, his attention to details but still seeing the big picture amazed me. No wonder they picked him as the great saver of the IBM legend.  The book is long and sometimes repeats itself, without going into details.  The part I enjoyed the most was his e-mails. How encouraging was he after 9/11, he mentioned employee names and all the things they did both to help and also to get their business going. He sent e-mails to his 300.000 employees. His tone and the things he mentions, his clarity was amazing. He is an excellent leader. IBM is very lucky to have such a good CEO.

1400044162|4.0|It is not often that a novel comes to hand that has been prized, praised and pre-inflated. Half of a Yellow Sun was in that category when I opened it and began to read. And I was captivated immediately. I read the first hundred pages at a pace, delighting in the ease with which the Chimanada Ngozi Adichie used language to draw me into the middle-class clique centred on the University of Nsukka which provides the core characters of her book. Their infidelities, their inconsistencies, their desire, despite the servants, for equality and freedom are symptomatic of their time. The dissimilar twin sisters, Olanna and Kainene, one imagines will provide a vehicle for parallel and different lives, providing contrast and metaphor, and I eagerly awaited their stories to unfold.<br /><br />The book's sections alternate between the early and late 1960s, the latter period in Nigeria, of course, being the Biafran War. And, yes, the characters live through the war, and their lives and their natures, and along with them their country, are transformed by it. Perhaps even their own identity is redrawn, especially once the promise of a recognised nationality is promised and then denied. Eventually there are vivid scenes of the war's brutality, its double standards, its compromises, its cynicism, its racism and its starvation. The images are graphic and vivid, unforgettable even, and the ability of war to undermine utterly and profoundly any assumption that an individual might harbour about an imagined future is movingly portrayed.<br /><br />So why then was I so disappointed with the book? All I can offer, I'm afraid, is that eventually I found it shallow. Its apparent concentration on the domestic lives of the characters undermined their credibility as members of an intellectual elite and rendered them two (or perhaps even one) dimensional. Chimanada Ngozi Adichie carefully tells us that Odenigbo is a mathematician and in love with his subject. He covets his personal library, which he loses in the war and then has replaced by a benefactor. But in my experience, mathematicians are passionate people - and are usually passionate about mathematics. No mathematician I have ever met avoids all mention of personal academic interests in social settings as scrupulously as Odenigbo. I didn't want the novel to become a textbook, but if characters were ballet dancers, surely we would expect to hear of the roles they had danced and the music that had moved them. Of Odenigbo's academic character we hear nothing. Why is he therefore endowed with knowledge and interest that is never explored? Perhaps he only exists as a character to interact with the twin sisters.<br /><br />And the problem is repeated with Richard Churchill who, we are told is an Igbo-speaking English radical. I knew a lot of sixties radicals and they were never slow to offer an opinion or, indeed, place themselves squarely in a space on the ideological chessboard. In Half of a Yellow Sun, we never learn if Richard is a Marxist, Maoist, Leninist or Trot. He never mentions Castro or Ho Chi Minh. He doesn't appear to have any position on capitalism, society, business, the Third World, South Africa, Central America or even Viet Nam. I found myself wondering which sixties decade saw his radicalisation. When Chimanada Ngozi Adichie tells us that he travels to Lagos to attend a function in honour of the state funeral of Winston Churchill (perhaps no relation), I began to wonder if he was an early- (or indeed late) born radical Tory. I have been an expatriate myself, so I can forgive him his attendance of the function, but not his total silence on the issues of the day.<br /><br />This becomes especially problematic when both Britain and the Soviet Union are mentioned as assisting the Federal Forces in the destruction of secessionist Biafra. What sixties radical, given the inevitability of his assumption of a Cold War bifurcated paradigm to underpin his ideological position, would not have ponderedand discussed this at length, even in bed?<br /><br />Eventually we also have to read along with continued adulation of Ojukwu. His Excellency might even be the Great Helmsman, himself, given that his free-thinking minions seem unable to mention a criticism of an historical character who eventually fled to Ivory Coast to save his skin and live his life in relative comfort after leaving millions of his own people dead. Perhaps he had to be preserved to fight another day, as he eventually did, if in a different way, but surely no sixties radical would have left his role unquestioned. It doesn't ring true, and an opportunity to develop a character like Richard through his own and inevitable disillusion was ignored.<br /><br />And then we are presented with a pair of American journalists that the radical Richard has to greet and service in his role as a promoter of the Biafran cause. They are both called Charles and apparently have the same nickname, Chuck - which surely should have been Charlie of the \\"right\\" variety to enhance the farce. They are simply not credible. We can probably accept as deadly accurate that the majority of Americans neither knew where Biafra was nor cared a jot about its plight, since the attentions of the politicised were focused elsewhere at the time. But the presentation of a pair of foreign correspondents as crass as these is surely incredible, as is, equally, Richard's apparent patience in dealing with them.<br /><br />I did also become mildly annoyed at what became quite extensive use of Igbo words when they seemed to offer no extra flavour, meaning or understanding. I have no problem with the use of local terms to enhance a feeling of place and sound, but their over use tends to obfuscate. We really wanted to know what these people thought, but we were never told.<br /><br />So what are we left with? Half of a Yellow Sun is a beautifully written, beautifully composed domestic tale of fidelity, infidelity, loyalty and opportunism. The contrast between the characters' and therefore the nation's lives at the start and the end of the decade is engaging. But because their psyches are never really explored, we never understand any motives or, therefore, any consequences. Reading Half of a Yellow Sun was a thoroughly enjoyable experience which, with hindsight, I would have foregone.ven in bed?

What do people in Kabul have in common with people in your hometown? Most people would be surprised at the universal struggles to find love, acceptance and to provide a good life for your children. Wonderful book by an incredibly talented writer Khaled Hosseini. I have yet to read Kite Runnner but it is now on my list. Life in Kabul from the Soviet invasion to 9/11 as detailed and gripping as you could imagine. The struggle of these Afghanistanis reminded me a bit of the Joad family in the Grapes of Wrath, and Mr Hosseini is no less a writer then John Steinback. High praise indeed. This book should reap a thousand splendid reviews.

This is an exciting film with nary a boring nanosecond. This film has style, heroic characters and a gripping narrative. The music, actors, writing and visuals are such so engrossing. Pretty accurate as far as historical details including some lines which were actually spoken, eg. when told the Persian armies arrows would blot out the sun, a Spartan fires back  \\"then we will fight in the shade\\". First time I watched I was glued to the screen and watched it again the next day. I don't buy too many dvd's anymore but this one is a keeper. Loved it!

0618680004|1.0|I have read parts of Dawkins book and found it to be rather narrow minded and arrogant.  As a fellow human being i do not claim to have all the answers, however, i refuse to insult someones intelligence because they believe and have faith in something higher than themselves.  After all, no matter what you believe it requires faith.  To think that we are a cosmic accident does not fit with my intellect because an explosion which Dawkins believes to be the source of life creates disorder not order.  Its like putting a bomb in a old Volkswagen and ending up with a Porshe.  This is just too much faith for me to muster.  Some say science cant prove that God exists.  I disagree as science can prove that there is a God by process of elimination.  Since Darwins theory in the 1800's (by the way would you go to a 1800's doctor for a reliable diagnosis?) DNA and RNA has been discovered. It has been proven that you cant add information to DNA and how it works with RNA is very complex.  Adding information to DNA would be required for evolution to work.  Its equivalent to creating something  from nothing which we all know is impossible unless something higher than ourselves has created it.  Obviously man cannot do this as we have not created one grain of sand. It is therefore fair to say that it is also hard for humans to understand.  Evolution and life cannot be produced by humans and is proving to be a scientific impossibility.  Therefore the only other solution is that there is a creator.  Nature also points to a creator.  If the sun was any closer to earth we would fry. If it was any further away we would freeze.  Could this have occurred as a result of an accident? No way!  Dawkins claims that religion causes conflicts in the world which may be right to a certain degree.  This annoys me a bit, however, because it is a deception to blame it all on religion.  It should be blamed on evil as evil has always been at war with good and evil did draw first blood.  In any case to kill in the name of religion is wrong, any one with a good conscience will tell you that.  It even states this emphatically in the Bible. \\"Love your enemy\\"  and \\"Thy shall not kill\\".  War and destruction is not Gods way for us as human beings.  Only God himself has the right to destroy life but he chooses not to at this stage. Christ did not come to destroy but to bring peace.  He is at war however, with evil.  Justice is the issue here Jesus is not only a Saviour but he is Lord as well.  This nature of God is decribed in the bible and this explains what many skeptics call contradictions in the bible.  But truth is indeed complex.  It takes wisdom, yes wisdom to understand it.  Who knows the mind of God?  Atheism is a religion without hope and is rather foolish when you think about it.  Dawkins has put all his eggs in one basket without hope. What if he is wrong?  Atheism also has no hope for man kind.  We are all going to die and most of us will be forgotton in the next 100 years?  If Dawkins is still remembered 100 years from now it could be for foolish reasons. Evolution is undeniably proved to be an impossiblity.  God can do the impossible.  If you are going to have faith in something why not try something that will give you hope and peace in life.  This is what the Gospel is all about.  Check and see if God is good.  Obey his commandments and see if your life will improve.  Pray and ask God to reveal himself to you in spirit.  Prayer is also a good way to be a healthy person.  This is also becoming scientific proof.  Dawkins has called every true Christian a liar.  There are coutless testimonies of Gods intervention into peoples lifes freeing them from all sorts of evil bondages.  This is proof isnt it?  Or do you know it all Dawkins.  You wouldnt even know 1% of all there is to know about our origins.  That other 99% you dont know will make you look foolish.  Life is a mystery. It is therefore reasonable to suspect that death will also be a mystery.  The only advantage in atheism is that it possibly frees one from guilt in this life.  This is self deception.  There are so many advantages in belief in God.  Alot of joy in life can be obtained by answered prayers.  He does listen and understands our condition.  An atheist will miss out on this.  I hope all come to the knowledge of God and we can all live in peace.  We are all reliant on Gods mercy.
0743277457|5.0|Josh Waitzkin transformed himself from a warrior of the mind into a top-level tai chi martial arts practitioner.  This is somewhat an unusual, as many/most chess players (with a few exceptions) appear to be pallid who would get sand kicked in their faces at the beach.  (Too much library and study time, perhaps.)      You may recall that Josh Waitzkin was the main character in the best selling book and popular movie, \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer.\\"  As a chess prodigy, he received intense publicity and attention, which wore thin on him as he progressed into his late teens and early 20s.  Even though he was a top level chess player, the pace of his progression did not advance to the point where he was challenging Garry Kasparov or anyone else for the world championship.  Being under the microscope became tiring, so he shifted his focus into tai chi.    This book is an unusual and difficult one to categorize.  It is part autobiography, part chess memoir,  part martial arts philosophy.  Essentially, Waitzkin offers his own approach to becoming a student and applying certain disciplines and habits toward learning and eventually mastering any skill.  Your mileage may vary, but for a 29 year old, Waitzkin's insights seem mature beyond his years.  It is almost unfair for a young person to be so accomplished and insightful, and I mean that as a complement.    In many ways, \\"The Art of Learning\\" reminded me of \\"Flow\\" by Mihaly Csiksentmihaly.  Focusing on the task and hand in getting better at it rather than obsessing over results and outcomes can be a liberating experience, paving the way toward learning and eventual mastery.      Whether you are a chess player or martial arts practitioner, \\"The Art of Learning\\" is a very effective study in one approach to building your skills in any realm.  The book could have benefited from both an index and bullet-point suggestions for the reader, but these are minor quibbles regarding what is an excellent book.

B000V39KDO|5.0|Although this movie is not completely historically accurate, when I read actual historic accounts there is a fairly strong framework of truth that the movie is built around. There are also quotes from the real battle used in the movie.These quotes show the amazing bravery of the Greek fighters.   This is a very engaging dreamlike account of a relatively small group of fighters who helped make a BIG difference in the history of Europe. For anyone who loves or even just respects Democracy, what happened at Thermopylae should be of high interest. I hope that this movie inspires people to read what is actually known about this heroic event.

David tells Max to land, and then in a moment of frustration says that he has to take a \\"leak.\\"  I almost didn't notice this (since I haven't seen the film for at least 10 years), but there is even a line further on in the film (when the ship goes under water) that references said omission.  David says he hopes that they don't get wet, to which the computer replies \\"I do not leak. You leak, remember?\\"  I fortunately got this entertaining movie for a very low price (and it was nice to revisit a childhood favorite), but I would not have purchased this film had I known it was censored.  (P.S.- Something similar happened with the re-release of \\"The Last Unicorn.\\")
B000E6ESL2|5.0|and I liked, no loved, this movie.  Although starting slowly, I was eventually drawn in until I became immersed in the film.  The visuals are stunning and I was awed by the morphing cut scenes.  I enjoyed the surreal atmosphere and was somehow stimulated by Gosling's dour performance.  Did anyone else notice that his character's name is an anagram of Hamlet?  Anyway, I'm buying the DVD because I want it for my permanent collection.
B000UR9TQE|3.0|I am a big fan of Led Zeppelin having seen them live in 1977 a year after this film was released. We'll have to wait and see what the final audio on these Discs contain, but if it only has a regular Dolby Digital 5.1 mix as what has been widely reported, then Led Zep has blown it again IMO. Most people don't even consider sound quality anymore when listening to music even though we have better technology today. Regular Dolby Digital is the equivalent to an MP3, very Lossy sounding and crap compared to DTS or DVD-A at 24 bit / 96 kHz. I still own the original VHS, Betamax and DVD versions, and those are stereo, certainly Not the great discrete aggressive surround sound mix I remember hearing in 1976 at the theater. I remember in the theatrical version with the proper speaker set-up Jimmy Page's guitar feedback bouncing back and forth throughout the front and rear speakers along with Robert Plant's vocals on \\"Dazed And Confused.\\" Totally awesome. That original theatrical mix is one of the \\"holy grail\\" Quad/surround mixes from the 1970's and it looks like we're never going to be able to hear it again.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I grew up watching this film and have loved watching it over and over again!  It's not a great film by any mean...it might actually be bad.  But a \\"good\\" bad movie is fun to watch from time to time.  And how can you go wrong with that wonderful cast?  It's one of those movies that you watch in the middle of the night and have a bowl of popcorn and just watch to have fun!  If you like that kind of movie...then this is the one for you!!!
B000UR9TQO|4.0|Does anyone know what Extra's this box contains? Compared to the regular DVD version of this concert? Does it contain any extra DVD or CD's?
B000PFUA9G|2.0|I guess 'Ticks' should have tipped me off, but the material on this CD just isn't as good as his previous CDs. Other than the Carrie Underwood duet, I don't really care for any of the songs.

B000FKO0S8|5.0|An extremely well crafted movie with all kinds of life lessons. The story of an accussed man and his plight through Shawshank prison hits deep. Morgan Freeman is at his pinacle with thought provoking acting while Tim Robbins(hate his personal politics) draws out lonely, innocencent yearnings in every way. Its actually bordering on a masterpiece of filmwork. It would be difficult to walk away from watching this film in its entirety not feeling that you've learned something big. As of this date the promised hd version is yet to be seen. Although the dank prison surroundings do not seem to demand a definitive hd transfer, clarity of viewing can only increase the already  cutting realism. I look foward to the blissful moments that give hope and make you watch - in high definition. I can only be forced to ask, whats the hold up? Sign up for the notification of release, you'll feel better. Peace.
6305308659|4.0|A town completely in black and white.  Safe.  Unexciting.  Mundane.  That's smallville.  However, strange things begin to happen when feelings are introduced.  Things that get the town up in arms and into a fight to maintain the status quo!  For me this movie is a love story.  Difficult to explain without giving it away.  Lets call it a date movie.  You will enjoy it.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|It's a good thing my husband and I watched this on DVD in our living room so that we could keep rewinding whenever we didn't follow something (which was often).  There was a scene where Jack Nicholson walks over to two priests in a restaurant and hands them a piece of paper.  We had to rewind about 5 times before we could pause at the right spot to see what was on the paper.  The acting was great, but the plot was too disjointed and confusing.  To add to the confusion, Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio even look alike!  We're not prudes, but the constant use of the F-word was wearisome after awhile and the fact that literally none of the characters had any redeeming values was depressing.  To sum up the plot:  Everybody's crooked, lots of blood, lots of profanity, everybody (almost) ends up dead.  The End.
0780626494|4.0|Very enjoyable movie about a paranoid Father who is afraid of nuclear war, and the collision of errors that sends his family into a bomb shelter for 30 years.  It is heartwarming, funny and romantic all rolled into one! And the Dad, he never learns!
B000ROALCG|5.0|I am enjoying the CD \\"El Cantante\\" by Marc Anthony.  I can't believe how much he sounds like Hector Lavoe and Jennfer Lopez's song is fantastic.  She finally sang a song I can enjoy
B00003CXE7|4.0|Though this is an OUTSTANDING movie it is a tragedy; and will leave you with that tragic feeling. You definitely root for Russell Crowe's character and you want to know what happens to him; which keeps you glued to the story.  There are \\"highs\\" in the movie.  You really want Russell to succeed and be redeemed.  There is \\"Justice\\".  I give it 4 stars even though its a five star movie because it leaves you with that down feeling.
032147404X|5.0|I just bought this book last Saturday and I have read completely through it and it was very good. I would rank myself as a advanced amateur and there were a lot of tips and simple explanations that will come in very handy.   I probably wouldn't advise this book for a professional, but he makes it clear that's not really who this is for.
B000002GBJ|2.0|I really love this selection of instrumental pieces by Rick Wakeman. His music is unique and, well, simply brilliant. I was thouroughly dissapointed with the quality of the music on the CD though. It was flat and sounded like some garage recording on cheap outdated equipment. My recomendation to others is try to find a remastered copy of this work (if it exists).
B000M53GM2|3.0|Well, I thought I'd just catch up on this Bond - may I call it a golden oldie? (sorry!) seeing I missed it first time around. What's the verdict in 2007? Let's see -    Continuous action rating - Very high.    Acting - Pretty good considering the nutty situations.     Unusual effects rating - excellent. Loved the big old Russian train (why can't we have some of those!) the famous tank chase, etc. (Of course you have to forget that a car could outrun a tank on any open street.)    Credibility of main theme - so-so. An electromagnetic pulse could be trouble, but it would be silent and invisible, not the good 'ol sizzling blue force-fields like St Elmo's fire - the movie cliché.     Credibility of combat sequences - don't ask. But in those days we took it for granted that hundreds of bad guys shooting at a visible target could never hit their man once, while the good guy could blast them by the dozen.  And someone could take innumerable knockout blows and recover to send the opponent flying. 'Twas always thus.    Credibility of explosions, crashes, etc - low. I get tired of seeing large all-metal structures suddenly combust for no particular reason. And people surviving the most disastrous plane crashes etc. with a few scratches and a dazed moment. But the explosions  sure looked good.     General absurdity rating - stratospheric.    But overall entertainment value - not bad! Nobody takes those things seriously anyway. And it was kinda nice to remember those innocent days when a visit to Guantanamo was offered as a welcome suggestion, and we could enjoy a few non-PC double entendres. How everything has changed.
B00001OH7P|5.0|David Bowie's most consistently enjoyable album.  Well, I don't necessarily agree with that, but the majority of people out there will tell you that.  \\"Five Years\\" is a great well-written song that almost sounds like a glam-rock ballad.  Is there even such a thing?  Maybe.  The title song is spectacular and probably the ultimate glam-rock masterpiece (even though it reminds me of the Paul McCartney song \\"Band on the Run\\").  \\"Starman\\" isn't related to the Super Mario Brothers starman that makes you invincible for a few seconds, but I sure feel invincible listening to this really neat little song that puts me in a stargazing state of mind.      \\"Hang on to Yourself\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\" are pre-punk songs.  Seriously, they sound punk-ish, and many people believe these songs influenced the punk genre.  \\"It Ain't Easy\\" always had a wild west vibe to me, but I may be alone on that one.  \\"Moonage Daydream\\" is just a perfect song for teenagers who like to dance, I think.  Really good album, however not really Bowie's best.  I don't know what his best album is, but it's probably not this one.
0007205236|5.0|I read this book years ago and it left a mark.  It's one of the best autobiographies I've ever read, mesmerizing to say the least.  Mr. McCourt recounts his childhood in Ireland, surrounded by poverty and hunger, up until the time when his dream comes true: going to the USA in search of a better life.    The prose is powerful and conveys a very clear picture of his life.  It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, some graphic descriptions might even make you look away, but what I truly liked about this book is the absence of sorrowfulness, especially when depicting some incredibly miserable events.    I went on to read \\" 'Tis \\", the sequel, and found it to be as good as \\"Angela's Ashes\\", perhaps a bit less powerful but great nevertheless.  Get both books if you haven't yet read them.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Yet another great series from David Attenborough and the BBC!  I was mesmerized by Blue Planet which shows you footage that seems almost staged, it is so impressive. Planet Earth seemed a natural transition. (pun intended? not sure). In any case, it's a beautifully shot series that leaves you breathless every time you watch. Brilliantly explained and explores areas of the world unfamiliar to the majority of viewers. Unfortunately, as is the trend with most of Sir Attenborough's productions, there has to be a scene in every episode where one poor animal meets a violent or heart-wrenching death, complete with dramatic background track. But it is a small price to pay for the beauty. An excellent addition for the naturalist videographer.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Another great entertaining series and I had to get this DVD of the series. My favorites selections usually disappear fast. I didn't get to see \\"Dead Like Me\\" before it was actually cancelled. Nevermind \\"Farscape\\" and \\"Firefly\\"  So all in all it contained all of the first season, so I'm happy,
B000HBK3MM|5.0|this CD is sooooo good. Any girl would like it. i especially like the song breathless.....its a must have
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I loved it-disappointed it wasn't shown in local theaters. It wasn't widely circulated at all. I loved it so much-I will buy it and watch it many times. I also loved, Enchanted April,too.
B00062IVKI|3.0|I ENJOYED THE FIRST PART OF THE STORY, BUT IT BECAME MOROSE AND DOWNRIGHT DEPRESSING TOWARD THE END.  OVERALL, IT WAS ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING  AS A TRIP TO THE DENTIST.    MINNELLI AND DE NIRO WERE GOOD ACTORS, BUT THE STORY WAS SAD.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|This was so boring. I am not a Bond fan but I thought this one would spark my interest. Ugh was I wrong. It felt like it was 3 hours long. It just dragged and dragged. The action scenes were OK. I saw nothing in this that I haven't seen in every other movie. I guess I will continue to be a Non-Bond fan.
B000002GFT|5.0|It's strange, because Fairport Convention was a group before, Sandy Denny, and after. However, there has NEVER, EVER, been a voice, at least in my lifetime, that has come CLOSE to Sandy Denny's! SHE, MADE Fairport Convention SOMETHING!!! This is without a doubt their best album, PERIOD, and is VERY addicting to listen to. Beware of this! The group are ALL amazing musicians beyond belief, but it is Sandy Denny's voice that MAKES this album what it is and became. She was SUCH a marvelous ethnic Irish singer with octaves that go all over the place, it was something to experience, and still is, thank God for Digital! We should ALL MISS this special sweet Princess of voice of ALL time, no matter the genre of music you like. She is SO sorely missed! She died 4/21/1978 (age 31), in a mishap that is a bit shady, falling down some stairs at her parents house??!! Whatever, I personally lost a person for whom I totally loved hearing that MOST beautiful voice. The voice of an angel!! I just, personally wish that there were more people that CARED for her in the ways that make people proud of whom they are!!! SHE was CERTAINLY something to be proud of both in beauty and talent!!! Many albums survive her and should be bought and listened to, to enjoy what this amazing woman brought to us all, well, whatever, you want to label her as, as a singer. She WAS and IS SANDY DENNY! Her OWN person, one in a million. To listen to her is like nothing else in life. This particular album, basically, says it all in her singing and the groups talent. It's a bummer that neither, made much of a mark of the major markets after they departed. This is something that is truely a mystery. What could have been. I am SO honored to have EVEN been in the same generation to experience this amazing woman. Damn, Sandy, I SO miss you!
B0009A40ES|4.0|Christian Bale is perfect for this role. He is genius in this. It couldn't have been better. I cant quite put a genre to this, its one of those 'multi-genre' type of movies, but it can appeal to so many tastes. Its kinda twisted and naughty but great at the same time. A must-see.
0618164413|5.0|I bought this as a baby gift for a little boy. His parents were delighted and I was honored that this was going to be the first book they have read to him. I loved Curious George when I was a child and I am sure this little one will enjoy this curious and mischevious little monkey as well. After all little boys are more curious than they are mischevious, just like Curious George.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Alien and Aliens is science fiction at it's pure best. Actually, I like Aliens even better than the first. Best sequel to a film, ever. As for the other 2...well, Alien 3 was OK I guess. It had it's moments. Resurrection, I'm just gonna pretend it doesn't exist. Though I admit, I have seen it more than once. Its just too poorly written. However, I love the character of Ripley, she is one of my fave characters in film anywhere. For die-hard fans, this set is for you.
1582701709|4.0|This is an excellent book.  Some of the parts seemed a little unreal, but the truth is once I used \\"the secret\\", it did seem to work.  If anything, it will help you think more positively about everything.  It will help you look at the people and things in your life as a daily blessing.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This edition is a must own. I loved the deleted and extended scenes, it just brought everything together perfectly and seamlessly. The soundtrack on this is probably my favorite from all 3 films. It is simply an exquisite movie and a sure classic. many people have complained about the lack of beginning or end to this but surely by now everyone must know that this is not a sequal, its a continuation, therefore, its SUPPOSED to be like that. And the length doesn't bother me either, I love longer movies, as long as they keep my interest.
B0007VZ9DK|2.0|This movie was a disappointed.  I think it was overrated.  I expected a lot more.  If you want to see great films in the same genre, try Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, The Godfather
B00005JPLW|3.0|Though I am a girl, I do enjoy violent brutish movies just as much as any guy. Still, This movie to me did not live up to the hype surrounding it. My fiance loved it (of course), but to me it was lacking somthing. Action-wise it was pretty cool, though I couldnt help but notice similaries to certain other films (ahem, LOTR, ahem). The Effects were top notch. The acting was a tad over the top, but it does work here. The plot was just OK for me. Yes everyone knows the outcome beforehand but I still think more could have been done with it. All in all, it was a fun sorta film but definetely overrated.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Without doubt, one of the funniest movies of all time. Even funnier than Life Of Brian and just as quotable.
0783227434|4.0|This is one of those awful cheesy movies that you cant help but watch over and over. Its great fun. Pretty much everything is awful in this from the effects to the acting, but, who cares?! Its such a mesmerizing movie. I cant even say how many times I've seen this since I was young. I don't own the DVD but I should. It really is a great cheesy classic. And no, I am not being sarcastic. Watch and you will see...
B000NA1XSA|4.0|I knew this would be worth reading, particularly for any recording enthusiast. It moves quickly into Emerick's days in EMI. The info is extensive, documenting the big sessions Emerick worked on in his assistant days and through to the beatles. This book emerges you in the everday goings on in typical 60s recording studios in London and then you immediately realise why the beatles were so original and demanding. Production techniques and technical breakthroughs are regularly discussed. Each member's behaviour/personality in the studio is documented too. Emerick did some great work with George Martin and Paul McCartney during those sessions and you can really appreciate what happened thanks to this book. You can also see why people burnt out after a few years.
B00008DDXC|4.0|This was a pretty fun film. I liked it better than the first one and the acting definetely improved in regards to the younger adults. The story was pretty interesting and it follows the book pretty nicely which was surprising. All in all, if you are a HP fan, you will love this film.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is smart humor with witt.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|you'll boycott it... because you can't put in the next DVD right after the end of the first one? I don't feel \\"screwed\\" by this. I felt screwed that all these so called horror fans (an average of only 18 people per theater in all of it's second week of release) didn't go see it the first time. It's too long? You sat through Lord of the Rings for 9.5 hours in the theater didn't you? Too long?<br /><br />The only thing I'll feel screwed by is if they put out a deluxe set at Christmas that includes the theatrical cut plus all the stuff on these two discs... and / or stuff not on these two discs. That will be the screw job.
0060763892|4.0|This book has it all...Cannibals, killer squids, glowing people and barbie-squad villains, and I enjoyed every guilty minute of it! I'm a big fan of disaster fiction- and in this novel the disaster is a toxic virus that has infected the waters off of Christmas Island. Enter: Sigma Force.  Sigma force a GI Joe'esque group of professionals who contain the problem and send medical experts to investigate on a donated Yacht.<br /><br />I liked the bacteria plot and the Marco Polo backstory, and I really liked Kowalski, he was funny! I was less excited about Gray's romance, and I found the villains really cheesy, particularly the sadistic (but hot and multi-cultural) women. They seemed so stereotyped. Does the guild hire from Barbizon? Seriously.<br /><br />I was torn about Gray's Parents subplot. On one hand I found them endearing, on the other hand I found them distracting. Maybe I would care more if I read the first book. I was grateful when that subplot ended.<br /><br />Overall, a solid entertaining book with some fun ideas and lot of shallow characters. I could easily see this being made into a movie. 4 stars.
B000059GEH|3.0|First of all, this movie is still hysterical.  It is a work of art.  Although Marilyn got top billing, she's clearly out-performed by both Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable.<br /><br />Let me, for a brief moment talk about the \\"Diamond Collection\\" version of How To Marry A Millionaire.  When you think of remastering, especially older films made on Cineascope or Technicolor, you think of rich, vibrant-colored stories in particular the Rogers and Hammerstein collection.  Excellent.  You, especially, think of the remastered Disney Collection.  Excellent.  Both of which, were competing genres at the time Marilyn was making a name for herself.  You might even throw the remastered \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" (1937) in the fray.  And yet, this \\"Diamond Collection\\" is barely passable as a DVD version.  This isn't a distinct restoration.  The images, even in the special feature section \\"Restoration Comparison\\" shows how little the previous version and the film version hasn't had much improvement with this collection.  Don't get me wrong, the sound reproduction is superb, but this is comedy and a lot depends on visuals.<br /><br />Recently, I started to repurchase the Disney collection-- their \\"Platinum 2-disc\\" set.  Cinderella, Peter Pan.  And, there is a profound difference between the last version and this deluxe version.  The Sound of Music, the same thing.<br /><br />This isn't to say, it's not worth watching, but there's little to no improvement in picture quality.  And, that's too bad, the technology is already here and their apology for \\"grainy film loss\\" is no excuse for not investing in a better color transfer system.
0618680004|3.0|A child might say, \\"Dracula wore a black cape and turned into a bat. People can't turn into bats. Therefore there is no Dracula.\\" Of course, the fact that Dracula DID exist in some form (Prince Vlad the Impaler),  would not dissuade the child.<br /><br />So it is with Dawkins. He defines God as \\"supernatural,\\" \\"personal\\" \\"intervening.\\" He might as well say \\"an old man who lives in the clouds.\\" Then he goes on to say that God doesn't exist.<br /><br />What doesn't exist might be the God of atheists and a few Christian fundamentalists, but for most of us, God is a lot more complicated. Buddhists, Pantheists, Unitarians, many modern Jews, Christians, Muslims and a whole lot more believe in a very natural God. A complete God that encompasses the entire universe. Not a puppet-master, but a collective whole. Belief in this kind of God is no more delusional than belief in an apple.<br /><br />For the most part, Dawkins is charging at windmills of his own construction. Of course he can defeat them.<br /><br />--Mykel Board
B0000UJDLM|4.0|She has a house full of animals, Johnny 5 finds her, 5 saids he is alive.I wish it was CC.
B00005JPKE|4.0|It is a treat to have Clint Eastwood deliver his latest piece of work.  \\"Letters of Iwo Jima\\" is shot in black and white and it is one of the finest war movies since \\"Schindler's List\\" that was made in the same style.  It is also a foreign movie, shot entirely in Japanese language. This is a story of WWII in Pacific, made entirely from the Japanese soldier's point of view.  These soldiers are just like any other.  They are dedicated to their country, their duty to their emperor and honor towards their fellow countrymen.  They are lonely, concerned about their families and their future.  Human nature and character trancends any morality tales.  Eastwood is not lecturing us here.  He is just showing us that no matter where people come from some are noble, some are not; some are decent and some are not.  However, Eastwood manages to make them feel human, strong and vulnerable at the same time. An absolute gem - must see movie.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Pixar continues the tradition of defining the creative and technical standards of feature-length computer animated motion pictures that it started with \\"Toy Story\\" back in 1995. What makes this film unique, like all Pixar movies, is that technical detail is used to accentuate a great comic script with heart. I would say other computer animated movies do the reverse, but then I would be saying that they have great scripts with heart, which they generally don't. Like all Pixar films there is something here for the whole family, the kids can enjoy it for the shear comic spectacle, such as when Remy the rat discovers he can control the boy Linguini like a marionette by pulling hairs under his hat and thus cook meals via remote control, and the adults can enjoy the comedy plus the irony of a rat who dreams of preparing fine food and how sometimes your own personal dreams can clash with family loyalty and society's expectations. Highly recommended. Extra features include:<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - With introductions by Ratatouille's acclaimed screenwriter/director Brad Bird.<br /><br />\\"Your Friend the Rat\\" - Remy and Emile star in an all-new animated short film.<br /><br />Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller - Cuisine and cinema come together in this behind the scenes look at how master chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller brought his real life expertise to the table.<br /><br />Lifted - In Pixar's latest short, Oscar nominated for Best Animated Short Film, a teen alien learns that failure is an option.<br /><br />Note that Pixar has been making great animated short films since ten years before the release of \\"Toy Story\\" and that a collection of 13 of their animated shorts dating back to their first in 1984 is due to be released on DVD the same day as this film. The only drawback is that \\"The Pixar Short Films Collection\\" will contain \\"Lifted\\", which is also on this DVD.
B00005KK4P|4.0|All of Schubert's eight symphonies, except for No. 8 \\"The Unfinished\\" and No. 9 \\"The Great C Major\\" (there is no No. 7 -- don't ask!), are usually considered lesser fare in his body of work and are often performed with a lighter touch. Conductor Böhm and the Berliners do make the major key symphonies jaunty, but also add some rhythmic punch along with deliberate foursquare tempi and a keen sense of musical architecture to give them the heft they need to sound substantial. The performances of No. 5 and No. 6 are the antithesis of the sprightly and rightly famous '50s-era recordings by Sir Thomas Beecham and are perhaps not as exemplary, but I've always found them so musically immaculate that I have no problem listening to them on a whim.     The recordings in this economical boxset are from 1963, '66, and '73. For the most part, they sound fine with plenty of bass and dynamic presence. Only occasionally does one hear some harshness on tuttis and fortissimos; certainly nothing to take away from the amicable, yet patrician performances.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This mind twister will keep you on edge. Hopkins shoots his wife, and even confesses. What seems like an open and shut case for a cocky attorney turns into a nightmare as he realizes the murderer he's trying to put away is more clever than anyone ever imagined. The biggest question: How did the murder weapon disappear when the house was surrounded? Unless someone tells you, you'll never guess in a million years! (all me and my husband's guesses were wrong). Very well-written and well-played by all the actors.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0061122416|2.0|I found the book too preachy. The author is pushy in his views and spells them out to the reader. There is little room for personal interpretation. In that regard the book reminded me of socialist realism. On the other hand it is quite famous and a short read.
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"Band of Brothers\\" is an epic production.  If you love America and all that we stand for(or stood for) you cannot possibly watch this without feeling like we have to find a better way to reward our veterans.    Although some characters may have been romanticised, the story depicts what history has already shown... that Easy Company accomplished an amazing feat that most could only dream of.    God bless the Easy Company    If you ever read a book ever again please make it, \\"The Biggest Brother: The life of Major Dick Winters\\".... you'll thank me!!!      .[[ASIN:0451215109 Biggest Brother : The Life of Major Dick Winters, The Man Who Led the Band of Brothers]]
B000QXDED6|5.0|While there is little doubt most will enjoy this film and the story it tells, I would have to say also that sex and violence while used tastefully and well within the context of the story are predominant enough for parents to preview the film first and make the decision on whether or not their children are ready for such material. I would suggest that parents could skip the part(s) that they deemed to be too much while viewing with a particular child.    That said, this movie is exciting, interesting, sexy, and action packed. The strength of the love, commitment, and nationalism that is portrayed by the main Spartan characters is awe inspiring while the evil and betrayal of others is more than a fair match for the Spartans. This sets up the classic good underdog verses the evil overlord scenario which is played out to the end. 9.5/10
0736063684|5.0|I love tis book is very simple to understand and to execute. The only down side of it is that it would had been much better is it had examples on reps and set to do for either cut or grow muscle. Overall great item.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I love this movie!  Wow, this movie has all the qualities I want in a movie - love, loyality, comedy, friendship, drama and heroism. The unique blend of actors and their characters makes Armageddon a movie I want to watch again and again!  Thank you Amazon for having this for purchase online!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie, \\"Grindhouse\\".    It's sad that they had to break the release into two separate DVDs.    I won't be buying either until they release the box set with the faux trailers included.    After all, that's what the definition of a grindhouse is, isn't it?  Two or more cheesy movies for one?
B000CRQX34|5.0|Python at their best.  This set is highly recommended and will be an essential part of any Monty Python Collection.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Great presence but wish it wasn't as grainy. However, the original theater release was too. If you like Sin City you'll like this movie.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Excellent movie. I don't like violent films but this was so well done I didn't mind the blood.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Some of the best reference material to see what HD is all about. I like narroter more than the Discovery version.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie was made after the TV show was canceled, which really says something about the fans and the crew. Once a show is killed off, it usually stays dead, but due to this show's massive following and fan support, Whedon was allowed to make his movie.    Great flic, but I'd recommend watching the Firefly series first.

B00007LTIB|5.0|I've heard it said that Going For the One's Awaken is the peak of Yes's early years.  But to me, Relayer is the pinnacle of a progression that starts with The Yes Album, and goes through Fragile, Close to the Edge and Tales from Topographic Oceans.  It's hard to review a Yes album, sort of like explaining why red is so red.  Suffice it to say that, if you like other 70s-era prog rockers, and haven't heard this album, you are in for a huge treat.

0671510991|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Dr. Kissinger is, without saying, one of the most talented and accomplished diplomats that this nation has had.  The fact that he ignited so much controversy on both the left and the right does much to confirm this view.  In this book, he traces the evolution of international diplomacy from the 17th century.  He begins with a discussion of Cardinal Richelieu, a talented practitioner of raison d'etat, which would later develop into realpolitik.  Richelieu, though a French Catholic prelate and regent, would ultimately cooperate with Protestant and Muslim rulers against the fellow Catholic Habsburg Empire.  It is easy to draw parallels between this and the Nixon-Kissinger policy of rapproachment with Communist China and efforts to play China and the Soviet Union against each other, to the benefit of the United States.  Dr. Kissinger also spends a lot of time discussing Metternich's \\"balance of power\\" brand of diplomacy, and Bismark's realpolitik.  It is clear from the presentation that he has a great deal of interest in, and respect for, these 2 men (and, in my view, with plenty of justification).  This book is a \\"must-read\\" for people who want a better understanding of diplomatic history.

0142001104|5.0|There is no change without leadership at all levels. This book is a good introduction into the principles of transformational leadership. Creating Possibilities for others such that they are touched moved and inspired. The leadership theory is based on leading oneself not others and focuses on who you are being not what you are doing. This is not a book about manipulative Machiavellian techniques rather it's about creating free choice for others where they are inspired by the possibility you have created.
B00004Z459|2.0|I put this CD in my iTunes library because the buzz was that it's really good, and because I had free access to it. Thus I thought, what the hell, even though Rap-Rock has repeatedly proven itself to be a reprehensible b^st^rd, I'll still load it up and give it a fair listen. And currently this CD has over 1100 five star reviews, so it must be pretty darn good, right? WRONG! It's just plain awful. Seriously. However, I am not so closed-minded that I don't have the capacity to understand how this CD might be appealing to someone who is simply too young to have a base of musical experience broad enough to be reasonably perspicacious. But if you are any older than 30, you should certainly be able to recognize this CD for what it is; a steaming puddle of butt mud. If you are over 30, have this CD, and find that you enjoy any aspect of it, you in the simplest of terms are an idiot. But that's alright, with hundreds of reviewers giving this CD a five star rating, idiots aren't exactly a rarity. And besides, I'm pretty sure you know that you are an exception, you're the intelligent person that enjoys this CD, no question.<br /><br />Now, unlike most, I am not going to simply say that 'Hybrid Theory' suck#, and then not give reasons why I believe it does. Anyone with an uncommon viewpoint should at least be willing to give a reason or two why they think what they do.<br /><br />Well, I listened to this CD with an open mind, and with no expectations, and even though I tried, I just could not find a redeeming quality. The musicianship is feeble (With no guitar work that extends beyond a few seconds.), the lyrics are truly vacuous, and the dual vocals are banal and monotonous. With this CD Linkin Park demonstrate only minimal instrumental and lyrical ability, and clearly reveal themselves to be nothing more than a glorified Rap-Rock boy band. But what's even worse is that I've actually seen these tools appear to take themselves seriously, and have the effrontery to act as if they are a significant band worthy of serious consideration. Their pretentiousness was appalling and revolting. Yeah, I know they've sold millions of albums, but so what, so did 'N Sync. And yes, that is a reasonable comparison, as LP is just as close to being a 'hybrid' boy band as they are to being a 'hybrid' nu metal band.<br /><br />While most will describe Linkin Park and their songs as \\"angry and aggressive\\", in actuality this particular CD proves to be nothing more than a 40 minute lyrical moanathon. In fact, if you read the lyrics you will see that from start to finish they are just plain whiny. Now, even though the incessant whining becomes really annoying, it is tolerable. However, what's not tolerable is the fact that in addition to the whining there is nearly zero optimism to be found. As a whole the lyrical message this CD conveys is; I'm really down, I'm still sinking, and I don't know what to do. As opposed to; I'm really down, but back the f *** up, because I'm going to get up and kick some as$. Kickin' as$ is what Rock is all about; it's not about being down and conceding defeat. Lamenting inexorable downtroddenness is what Blues is about and for. However, I've heard Blues with more buoyancy than this twaddle. Linkin Park's pathetic lyrical approach to these obviously contrived angst ridden songs is laughable at best. But just in case you didn't know, this \\"angry\\" LP crew are in reality middle-class white boys straight outta Agoura Hills. You know, Agoura Hills, CA; a well-known hotbed for uber-p!s$ed youths, where sadly the median family income is only a mere $100K. As one very astute professional reviewer put it; \\"It might be easier to believe in all this angst if the group members didn't take such pains to thank their families in the lengthy acknowledgments in the CD booklet, followed by an extensive list of product endorsements. But even without the fine print to undermine its sincerity, Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an alreadyoverdone musical style.\\"<br /><br />While Linkin Park's ridiculous posturing is obviously fooling countless fools, don't fall prey, and don't buy into the carefully manufactured hype. There is quite simply nothing substantive here to justify it. If you want to hear some angry Rap-Rock that's genuine get a Rage Against The Machine CD. RATM is a pioneer of the Rap-Rock genre, and the pioneer of angry Rap-Rock. But unlike Linkin Park, RATM has proficient musicianship and respectable non-contrived lyrics. Furthermore, RATM's angry lyrics are proactive, and are primarily aimed at political and social injustice. There is no woe-wallowing or unjustifiable despair stemming from what amounts to little more than having a bad day.<br /><br />In conclusion, please don't make the same mistake I did; avoid this CD at any cost. And even if you can get it for free like I did, when it's all over, just the fact that you spent your time listening to this CD will make you feel like you've been f###ed over, and aurally befouled.<br /><br />What you have just read is my honest (and what I am sure will be unpopular) opinion. And even though I believe that I've given valid reasons why I think this CD is nearly unlistenable, I am certainly under no delusion that my review will change the views of any LP fans.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|The guy at the video store told us that Miss Potter was the younger sister of Harry Potter and that if we loved Harry we would enjoy hearing about the branch of his family that talked to animals.<br /><br />It was so cute.  The animals the Potters consorted with are made of animation, so they move, dance and wiggle as Miss Potter talks to them.  Sometimes, her drawing skills bring the papers to life and the papers crinkle up and twitch like a real duck would.  Then she chuckles.  \\"Naughty Jemima Puddle Duck,\\" she murmurs throatily.  It's Renee Zellweger from CHICAGO and COLD MOUNTAIN playing a Potter for the first time--she fits right in to the world of jolly old England circa the 1900s.  Although the events of this latest Potter take place decades before Harry goes to Hogwarts Abbey, you get the same kind if family dynamic going on.  In Victorian London little Beatrix is ignored and patronized by a mean mother and absent father and pesky little brother Bertram, just as Harry is abused and picked on by the Dursley family, fat old Uncle Vernon, nasty Petunia, and the little monster boy, Dudley Dursley.  As we learn, as a girl Miss Potter was not allowed to attend Hogwarts Academy (nor any school, for most girls were educated at home by governesses and private tutors).<br /><br />The DVD features a great documentary about the real life Miss Potter who, due to her snobby family's imposing connections, became acquainted with the great Pre-Raphaelite painter Millsis (1829-1896), who praised the intricate nature drawings of little Miss Potter and encouraged her in her task of bringing the animals to life.  Fans of the Potter series will enjoy the documentary about Peter Rabbit and how he came to be.  Ewan McGregor (from STAR WARS and MOULIN ROUGE) plays the love interest, Norman Warne, who encourages Miss Potter to talk to the animals.  For Christmas she makes him a special present, a painting of the rabbit's Christmas party, which he treasures as long as he lives.<br /><br />A lovely romance ensues, with not just Norman, but also with Willie Heelis, a gardener boy (or something), and later on in life Miss Potter finally gets it together to buy all the land surrounding Hill Top Farm and turn it into eternal preserve of beauty in the Lake District of England.<br /><br />The Potters guard an ancestral treasure that plays a secret melody when Norman touches it, a music box encoded with the heartrending theme song, When You Taught Me How to Dance.  This theme is also sung over the credits by Katie Melua, the Georgian/Irish pop singer who made this track a hit in Lake District gift shops and in tea rooms in San Francisco here when we want a shot of Potter-mania, we hear it.  Its delicate air is like a breath of spring, and yet it has a fey note of shadowy foreboding to it, as though somewhere around the corner, lurks the shadow of the First World War and, or am I reaching, the hideous form of Lord Voldemort, with words by Richard Maltby Jr. screenwriter of this latest Potter film, and music by Mike Batt--who wrote the haunting song \\"Bright Eyes\\" as the theme for that other famous rabbit movie, WATERSHIP DOWN.sues, with not just Norman, but also with Willie Heelis, a gardener boy (or something), and later on in life Miss Potter finally gets it together to buy all the land surrounding Hill Top Farm and turn it into eternal preserve of beauty in the Lake District of England.

0743298020|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book.  I found the first few pages an effort and vaguely depressing but once the old woman began to tell her tale i was hooked.  I stayed up to 2.30am because i had to finish it even though i had to be up for work at 6am.  This tells you how addictive a read it is.  It had everything i love in a book - big old rambling house, family saga, jealousy, mystery and an old woman who survived it all recounting her story.  Really recommend this book.  Would put it in my top 3 books of this year so far.
B000L43QJ2|5.0|I wavered over buying this version due to the comments of other reviewers who considered the piece to be dominated by two less than involved principals. Fortunately I went ahead and what a delight this production is in the French manner - and I think that is the key as it is so fluid in dancing and graceful in style.   The production values are excellent -the scenery is restrained and complements the dancers without dominating them, the lighting is unobtrusive in setting mood changes and the pastel costuming is elegant and appropriate. The PO corps de ballet is (as always) highly skilled and large groupings move effortlessly around the stage - they are a pleasure in their own right. As for the Principals, I would choose words like imperious over icy,and anguished instead of impersonal for Agnes Letestu. She dances silkily with precision and manages the dual roles with convincing changes of emotion -e.g. the closeup of Odile's ominously wicked smile on her entry to meet the Prince. Martinez as her companion is less overt but his style is controlled elegance and if you are familiar with it then you will know what to expect.   Karl Paquette I liked in Paquita and he is also well cast in the tutor's role and as a suitably Machiavellian Rothbart rather than the usual openly evil characterisation - with a bonus of getting the best costuming. Overall an engaging production well worth having with one shortcoming that is still too common with video directors who do not appreciate that closeups of dancers rarely work. A notable exception is mentioned above,but there were still too many for my taste. They interfere with the flow and invariably work against the performance - you don't see them from the circle and neither should we on dvd. That apart the spread of shots from different angles (and above) was seamless and no significant moments were missed so together with a soundtrack also superb in surround sound this version of Nureyev's production is highly recommended.

B0000DC13U|3.0|I must have had this movie in my hands a few dozen times before I finally picked it up in a hasty moment recently. The reviews herein hit the nail pretty squarely and if you are wondering about it, please take note: THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE STONES.<br />I know nothing of Jean-Luc Godard's work and have no desire to if this is indicative of his style. That's not a knock on him at all, just a definition of my own taste. That said, the Stones footage is priceless, especially is you are intrigued by what some might consider the mundane nature of composing a song. Keith has often confessed that the best songwriting of the band comes from what he calls a \\"marination\\" process and that is an apt description of how Sympathy for the Devil is created in the footage from the studio we are treated to. The film captures this fascinating process as the song progresses and transforms. Highlights along the way are Keith's seemingly off-the-cuff riffing that mirror the final stinging solo of the recording, the keyboard morphing from organ to the more classic piano, and the percussion component ending with the now classic work from Rocky Dijon. It was like being a fly on the wall and proved mesmerizing to me.<br />However, if you are inpatient with the interwoven parts of the film that the back cover calls \\"political cartoons\\" and find it too tedious to sift through, I would strongly advise renting before owning. Interestingly enough, I found Gimme Shelter far more frustrating because much of the Stones footage in that movie was focused on Jagger exclusively. In this movie, we are treated to a broad canvas and get to see everyone, including Brian Jones, contributing. Many slag off his part in the process, but I think he was doing his best and was not nearly as \\"out of it\\" as many reviewers have stated.<br />Five stars for the Stones, minus two for the rest, that's the final rating of three.
0061122416|4.0|However, I must caveat my title by saying that I consider any work of art worth my time if it presents to me a new perspective/idea on the way I view the world.    Probable SPOILERS:    This novel, which reads more like a parable (or fable), is told mostly through the eyes of a young shepherd boy named Santiago who goes on a quest to fulfill his dream of finding a great treasure at the Pyramids of Egypt.  Along the way, he runs into a mighty king, a crystal maker, an Englishman, the Alchemist, and of course, the woman of his dreams.  He overcomes hardship with some help from his friends and ultimately finds what he was truly looking for.    The message is simple and clean, and it's a good distraction from the drudgeries of modern life which just might make you rethink your life if you already aren't living for your dreams.  It took me a couple days to read through the entire thing because I kept getting distracted, but it would be very easy to power through this book in a couple of hours if you sat down alone and just read it for what it is - a good story.    I especially liked the allusion to the centurion's servant.

6305558167|5.0|I just saw this film again last night. I first saw it years ago as a teenager and it had a great impact on me then but I can say that with repeated viewings I have extracted more.    Essentially this film is really well crafted. I have to confess that I have not read Sir Thomas Mallory's \\"La Morte d'Arthur\\" upon which this film is supposedly largely based but it seems to me that Boorman has threaded together a number of themes of medieval and dark age literature with seamless ease.  King Arthur is, in fact, Siegfried, King Marke and Amfortas (from the Parzifal legend) wrapped into one. This is beautifully expounded by the adoption of effective musical motifs taken from Richard Wagner's mature operas: Gotterdammerung (Siegfried's funeral march), Tristan und Isolde (prelude), Parsifal (prelude). Boorman, in particular, uses the music from Siegfried's funeral march to symbolize the triumph that is Arthur's life as courageous, then noble, then forgiving King - in the manner of the three characters for which he is an effective amalgam. He uses the death motif at the beginning of Siegfried's funeral march during dramatic moments and Wotan's doom prophecy motif for certain isolated moments with Merlin - yes, Merlin here is Wotan according to the use of Wagner's motif but it is particularly fitting.    Of course, the nature of the nordic myths is such that there is a great deal of overlap among the various heroes and Gods and the likes so that one character from one myth is often based on a character from another. It is also the case that many of the myths do get interwoven into some great saga thereafter - think Tolkein's Ring and think Wagner's Ring based essentially on the same sources. What is great about Excalibur is that the integration of the myths is pretty fluid throughout and the central thread is the progression through Arthur's life from naive squire to wise and weary King.    Many other themes are covered here - the wound that will not heal (Lancelot as Tristan- note Wagner linked Tristan to Amfortas so this is fitting here), Perceval (read Parsifal) is the innocent fool who procures the grail to redeem Arthur (Amfortas).  Guinevere is both Isolde and Elsa who is championed by Lohengrin (again read Lancelot here). It's all in there and it's very smooth.    Okay, apart from the excellent integration of manifold myth accompanied to the lush musical Wagnerian tapestries, you have great cinematography throughout - this is how to do myth!  The acting is also top notch - you have young English/Irish stars such as Byrne, Stewart, Neeson, Redgrave, Williamson, Mirren - for the most part before they were particularly famous. There are a couple of really dodgy performers in there as well but the relatively minor roles do not detract from the overall effect.    This film is played as myth, the dialogue is relatively simple but often witty (in the hands of Williamson, for example), but this is exactly what myth is about. The synthesis of music, cinematography and rich drama that  incorporates, as I have said, so many nordic myths render this just about the ultimate cinematic portrayal of such myth that you will ever get. It is ideal for people interested in nordic myth e.g. Nibelungenlied, Eddas, Saga of the Walsung, but it is also ideal for teenagers just interested in all the glamour of the chivalrous age - as I was at the time. Probably not for kids though since there is a lot of limb hacking in evidence. This is a symbolic myth telling that has real-world, adult symbolism and is not a children's tale of the type you will get from Tolkien, so in this respect it depends what you want but basically any normal human being should buy this - full of great emotional moments!
1559409010|5.0|Most people see the obvious religious parallel in this movie, but by far the majority of the satire is political: this is a lampoon of the near-insane thinking of left-wing groups of the sixties.      Unfortunately for us today, the satire didn't help (it rarely does, since lefties have no sense of humor).  These former splinter-group \\"revolutionaries\\" are now in major mainstream organizations where they weald enormous influence.  The kind of cracked thinking that is so hilarious in \\"Brian\\" you can find on political sites all over the web.      Would it help if these people were tied to a chair and forced to watch \\"The Life of Brian\\"?  I doubt it.  They just wouldn't get it.  Or they would say it applied to someone else but not to them.      So, see the movie and laugh and cry.  Because \\"Reg\\" and his crew are not on the outside now.  They are trying desparately to elect the next President.

B000NA1XSA|5.0|While there are plenty of entertaining stories and anecdotes, and maybe half a dozen or so \\"digs\\" that are indeed biased towards McCartney, the real value of this memoir lies in the details of the recording process.  I found this work much more compelling than the George Martin's \\"All You Need is Ears\\", and for my money this is the definitive history of the Beatle's body of work, at least as far as in how the recordings were actually constructed.<br /><br />Everyone (McCartney, Martin, et all) likes to take credit for the innovations and techniques that created the final Beatles sound, but I am happy that Mr Emerick published this volume.  The fine detail of his recollections ring true, and while he properly credits George Martin with the arranging, scoring and production duties, we learn that much of what we finally heard on the recordings was obviously due to the resourcefulness & creativity of the recording engineers (\\"button pushers\\").  We learn that the role of producer was largely occupied with managing personalities, while the engineer focused more on the technical aspects of the sound canvas.  For today's home based recording musicians, it is the latter's role that is perhaps of more value.<br /><br />OK, that was a pretty quick & clumsy review, but highly recommended.

0307341550|4.0|First the good news:  Gillian Flynn can write.  She's written a page-turning, psychologically-based mystery that keeps the reader craving to find out more.  In Camille, she's created a truly compelling and unique character: a cub reporter, recently out of the psychiatric hospital for \\"cutting\\"... self-destructive yet blessed (cursed?) with insight.<br /><br />Now for the not-so-good news: after thoroughly hooking the reader, the author suddenly makes a bolt for the finish line.  No spoilers here:  it's just that the ending strains credibility and tries to tidy everything up quickly in an implausible coup d'etat. And by creating a two-leveled ending, the horror of the original premise becomes diluted and lacks the intensity it should.<br /><br />My final assessment:  two-thirds of this novel is well worth reading.  The last third doesn't work.  But hey, this is Gillian Flynn's first novel and from her writing ability, I'm sure even better is on the way.
B00001OH7V|3.0|Starting with the quirky beats of \\"Beauty and The Beast,\\" HEROES is not always successful, but it always intrigues. The CD starts strongly with a more straightforward rock approach, hooks you can hang on to, Bowie's mannered vocals clearly annunciating the typically impenetrable lyrics, and some of his strongest works ever, particularly the majestic title track, where his collaboration with Eno reaches a wonderful synthesis creating one Bowie's best ever tracks. But after the first five tracks, we enter the instrumental experimentation phase; your acceptance of this will depend on whether you feel they're valid tracks or flights of ego. I fall somewhere in the middle. I enjoyed the gripping sax driven \\"V-2 Schneider\\" and the ethereal \\"Moss Garden,\\"(Although this may be responsible for some later New-Age pieces)  but the bad horror movie soundtrack of \\"Sense of Doubt\\" and the electronic noodling of \\"Neukoln\\" leave me cold. Not his best work, but on the strength of the good songs well worth having.
006112429X|4.0|The novel is based upon a series of letters that the protagonist, Eva, writes to her husband, wanting to understand what went wrong with Kevin, what made Kevin do what he did. The letters are truly mesmerizing in a horrible/haunting sort of way. I was reminded of Lovely Bones, where the horror of the act that Kevin committed is not as terrible as you think it might be, that you can stomach it if only because you want to understand how it came about.     Eva is by her own admission, not the best of mothers. Still her letters are so well written, at times the word choice so exquisite, the stories she tells so commanding, that you pull back and think 'this is an intelligent woman' and you admire her and wish you could know her. Other times you despise her and want to shake her and say 'how could you pit yourself against him all the time, be reasonable' . In the end I felt only pity for her, she obviously didn't realize what she had when she had it and she failed to recognize the warning signs. So she confines herself to her own little hell, and in the end comes to understand more about her son and herself - perhaps more than she ever really planned too.     Shriver is a dark writer - by her own admission (at the end of the book we get a conversation with Shriver about Kevin, about books she recommends...). She is very convincing at portraying Eva as a successful woman who occasionally suffers from insistent whining...ah, but such is the dilemma of first person novels... and Eva is perhaps sometimes too much the villain, but then hind sight is always better than foresight...Still this is brilliantly written and well worth reading, a letter at a time. I could even forgive Shriver's use of \\"mobile\\" instead of cell phone (apparently, Shriver has been residing in London for a very long time). Shriver's character, Eva, most likely would have used the word 'mobile' rather than 'cell', if just to distance herself from the general rabble so I let it slide, figuring it to be more in keeping with Eva's character, although at first I felt it a grating mistake for one who is so bent on being right and supposedly American.     A haunting tale that captures your attention and holds it through 400 pages wanting to know how it ends...
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Films like these, seem as much like a personal confrontation of the past as a treatment of a brutal national history.  The wonder of 'The Lives of Others' is that it manages to be both these things simultaneously, the rare story that is personal, political and paced like an old fashioned spy game.  The balance of the film is what sustains it.  We know the observer is both the consummate professional and a secret humanist.  The observed is a man who prides himself on loyalty, but begins to consider deceit.  Around them, a brutal atmosphere with barely a trace of oxygen to breathe.  It's a state of combustion that keeps the audience breathless.  It's also one of the few films I've ever seen where a 'double' ending works.  There's a natural, terrible climax to the fight between individual and government, but the flash forward that ends the film, rather than being the usual damp squib you wished had never been filmed, is a poignant after-taste all the more emotional in the final understanding of how much old foes always had in common.

B00005JPRZ|4.0|You know those madcap comedy films in which absolutely everything goes wrong and chaos ensues? That's pretty much what you'll get from Frank Oz's \\"Death at a Funeral,\\" an over the top yet effective British farce that--if I may be allowed a ridiculous and overused saying--puts the \\"fun\\" in \\"funeral.\\" Indeed, this is a funny movie, a creative blend of dry satire and physical humor that amounts to an interesting (if a little overplayed) character study. And that's how it should be, especially if the story involves a crazy family gathering for a funeral. The major characters are dysfunctional to a frightening degree: brothers squabble over each other's lives; cousins are neurotic and unable to say the right things; boyfriends are despised; old flames are futilely trying to reconnect. Just imagine all these people under the same roof.    The comedy begins almost as soon as the film does. The grieving Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) awaits the arrival of his father's body. When the coffin arrives, he peers in for final identification. \\"Who's that?\\" he asks. \\"That's not my father.\\" \\"We brought the wrong one!\\" one of the undertakers exclaims before they close the lid and rush off. A simple and somewhat predictable joke, no question. Yet it still has an agreeable charm. And it was clearly meant to serve as a framing device, signaling that what lies ahead for the characters will be far more chaotic, dangerous, nerve-wracking, and above all, humorous. I don't dare question the implausibility of this film; screwball comedies don't work on realistic levels simply because realism is not funny.    So then what is funny when it comes to \\"Death at a Funeral\\"? How about a man in a drug-induced delirium? This is exactly what happens to Simon (Alan Tudyk), the boyfriend of Martha (Daisy Donovan), the dead man's niece; mistaking a powerful hallucinogen for Valium, Simon takes a pill and spends the rest of the film ranting incoherently and seeing things that aren't really there. He believes that something is alive in the coffin because it's moving. He notes how green everything around him is. He unrolls toilet paper, telling the sheets to join the others. But his most erratic behavior shows up late in the film--and while I won't tell you what he does, I'm sure you have a good idea from the ads. Martha is understandably on edge; aside from her warped boyfriend, she also has to deal with a former lover, who won't leave her alone, and her father, who despises Simon for no apparent reason.    Here's another funny scenario (and this is the film's most important subplot): a secret gay affair. Apparently, Daniel's father was not who he seemed. And this comes to light when an American dwarf named Peter (Peter Dinklage) introduces himself as the secret lover. In believing that he's entitled to something, Peter blackmails Daniel for 15,000 pounds. If Daniel doesn't pay up, Peter will expose the truth to the entire family. This is but one extra level of pressure Daniel is now under: for one thing, his writer brother, Robert (Rupert Graves), failed to pay for his half of the funeral; but more importantly, Daniel and his wife, Jane (Keeley Hawes), need a down payment for a flat away from his parents' home. Between the extra funeral expenses and the blackmail money, it doesn't look like he'll be going anywhere.    Now imagine how much crazier this situation gets when Peter is tied up and gagged. The sheer insanity of this scene is actually more exhausting than funny; how many things need to go wrong before the film's sense of humor goes too far? I ask this because there's a fine, fine line between fun and pointlessness, and I'm not entirely sure that \\"Death at a Funeral\\" balances itself accordingly. Every joke is over the top, but some are more over the top than others, and they are the ones I end up questioning. Still, I did find myself giggling more than once at the intentional ridiculousness. More often than not, physical gags and four-letter dialogue are funny.Even the family drama between Daniel and Robert is a little funny, simply because their problems are so common as to seem relatable. Daniel is jealous that Robert has become a successful novelist; because of this, it's automatically assumed that he, not Daniel, will deliver the eulogy. Daniel is jealous enough to try writing his own novel (Peter reads some of the manuscript and says, \\"I tried writing once; it didn't work out for me, either\\"). He's also annoyed that Robert ran off to New York, essentially deserting his family while spending a great deal of money. Doesn't such rivalry and tension seem all too familiar? Aren't there people like this in every family, siblings or otherwise? I don't think this subplot was meant to serve as a counterpoint to the comedy; rather, I think it adds a different level of comedy altogether, a level that can easily be understood.    Such is the way with \\"Death at a Funeral,\\" a film that isn't afraid to use death as a way to make us laugh. There was once a Broadway musical called \\"Dance of the Vampires,\\" and it featured a song called \\"Death is Such an Odd Thing\\"; I found myself thinking of that title as I watched \\"Death at a Funeral,\\" simply because the point it makes is true. And death gets even more odd when you consider the people who will go on living. Will they keep the dead person's memory alive? Will they remember the dead person fondly? Will they remember the dead person at all? Will they even go to the funeral? I ask this because I've never attended one. I only hope that when I do, death will seem less odd and more dignified.
B000007ODX|5.0|With Chopin's nocturnes unquestionably being among the most graceful and beautiful compositions ever written for solo piano, Daniel Barenboim's 1981 recording pretty much sums up their \\"nocturnal\\" mood. Somber, low-key and thoughtful, these interpretations are played to never cause much stir or startle the listener -- maybe with the exception of the most rousing and splendid highlight, No.48/1. Barenboim feels at ease with the pieces, never trying to astonish with the technique in the first place. You may lack some deep emotion so often conveyed by Chopin's writing, but in the final analysis, these performances are very satisfying.
B000L212HC|2.0|This movie is ultimately confusing to someone who's a natural blonde like me. It starts at the end, ends at the beginning, and throws in an unnatural amount of twists & turns throughout the duration. It's complicated, and it doesn't help that I was trying to work out the final twist, but I didn't. It was right there I should have done.<br /><br />The Prestige has an outstanding cast, including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale (who I'm still not sure about as an actor), a short turn by Piper Perabo, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johannssen and a surprising appearance by David Bowie! Of all people! (He's looking old.)<br /><br />I have to say this movie kept me riveted throughout, but I just couldn't understand it. A big hand for all those who could. I just couldn't follow it. But why should a film about magicians/illusionists be straight forward?

B00006AW2S|4.0|Out of Our Heads tends to focus more on R & B tunes  than the bluesier numbers they'd done in the past.  One reviewer calls this the best of the early releases but I personally believe Now! is a far stronger release.  I gave Now! 5 stars (not one stinker!) so I can only give this one 4.5.<br /><br />Jagger delivers a surprisingly strong cover of \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\".  Ok, maybe he apes Otis Redding a little too much but this vocal is very good, one of the better recordings of his career I think.  There is one track on Out of Our Heads that I feel should have been replaced with something a bit better.  \\"I'm All Right\\" is a live track, lots of the typical screaming girls from a Stone's performance, Jagger's voice also cracks badly at one point. It isn't an awful track but surely they had better stuff in the can.  Of course, this is the release with the tune that really put the Stones on the map once and for all time \\"Satisfaction\\" and who can argue with its lasting impact?<br /><br />So yeah, you want this one if you love the early Brian Jones era Rolling Stones though this is really the release where it all started to go wrong for a young Mr Jones who was losing his grip on the band's direction mostly for the worse in my opinion.  Sure, there are some exceptions to that comment (most notably that quartet of releases from Beggar's Banquet through Exile on Main Street) but I really loved the early edition of this band and wish there was more of that music around.

B000V1Z8KK|3.0|I'm surprized at the other reviewers who expected this to be a follow-up to the departed. This is an action movie, and a pretty good one at that.<br /><br />There's nothing much original here, the plot is formulaic. In fact it \\"borrows\\" liberally from other films that I have seen. Does this sound familliar: Special forces ops gets framed for a murder he doesn't committ.<br /><br />From second one of the movie you probably know exactly how it's going to end. If you have watched a couple of action movies, you can probably tell the role of every new character introduced in about 3 seconds flat.<br /><br />That being said, for pure escapist entertainment the movie is pretty good. I thought the sniper angle was interesting, although Wahlberg's rote delivery of technical detail was lacking.<br /><br />If you want to sit back on your couch and watch a pretty good shoot-em up, this is probably th emovie for you.

1596912375|5.0|The \\"Cambridge spies\\" will forever be grist for the British literary mill.  Boyd's entry is a vivid double narrative about a woman's brief career as a spy in the early years of World War II and her daughter's rediscovery of her mother's secret past decades later, capped by a fitting denoument.  Boyd's deservedly-praised ouevre covers the novelistic waterfront and he certainly cannot be pigeonholed in this particular genre, but he does it more than justice.
B00005JPQR|4.0|As director Paul Greengrass proved with [[ASIN:B000GH3CR0 United 93]] last year, he has an uncanny ability to tap into something viscerally powerful with his films. His extensive background in documentary filmmaking really comes to the fore when it comes to the ultra-lean storytelling, propulsive pacing and superbly rendered action sequences in this genuinely suspenseful 2007 film. Densely conceived plot turns are swift and sometimes contrived enough for eye-rolling, but Greengrass knows how to keep a viewer enraptured with his pure cinematic technique. As the third and presumably final entry in the Bourne series, which update Robert Ludlum's nail-biting novels from post-Vietnam War to the far more ambiguous post-9/11 era, this one picks up immediately where 2004's [[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy]] left off with CIA assassin Jason Bourne still struggling to recollect his past as he dismantles conspiracies emanating from the senior operatives within the agency.<br /><br />Bourne has become the CIA's most-wanted. Regardless, despite a number of cunning assassins on his trail, he is intent on finding out who he is amid muddled flashbacks of mysterious interrogations. He gets help from fellow CIA agent Nicky Parsons, his former Paris contact, in Madrid where they end up in a diabolical chase through the alleys and rooftops of Tangiers. Both returning from [[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU Supremacy]], Christopher Rouse's kinetic editing and Oliver Wood's hand-held camerawork make a powerful impact on this scene by making the action feel compellingly claustrophobic. The action all works toward a head-turning series of twists that bring Bourne closer to his real identity. The elaborately constructed screenplay is credited to three writers - Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi - who know how to play off our own paranoia about security and U.S. intelligence. Playwright Tom Stoppard apparently also had a hand in the final script. A sharp, Grade-A cast has been assembled, though this movie is obviously not an actor's showcase. Matt Damon returns as Bourne, all cool physicality with enough non-ironic humanity to allow us a rooting interest in his fate.<br /><br />Bringing her natural authority to the role, Joan Allen also makes an effortless return as Deputy CIS Director Pamela Landy. Her philosophical adversary at the agency is the Machiavellian CIA official Noah Vosen played with surprising relish by the usually low-key David Straithairn. Paddy Considine makes the most of his few scenes as the understandably confused Ross, while an avuncular Albert Finney shows up late in the film with menacing subtlety as the key to Bourne's memory. The one weak link continues to be Julia Stiles, who maintains her poker-faced petulance as Parsons from the previous films and remains only marginally interesting as Bourne's female foil by default in this go-around. However, it's really Greengrass' craftsmanship that shines brightest here. A perfect example can be seen in the extended breathtaking chase sequence with a British journalist Simon Ross being tracked through London's particularly busy Waterloo Station for a planned rendezvous with Bourne. If there is one drawback to the third film, it is the presumption of some understanding of what happened in the first two installments. It just makes some of the set-up a little harder to follow. Otherwise, this is bracing, often enthralling entertainment for anyone who loves this genre of cinema.movie is obviously not an actor's showcase.

0321200683|5.0|This is a fantastic book if you are looking for patterns to base your messaging designs and architecture around.  The way this book goes about explaining some of the asynchronous messaging patterns seemed to provide a great deal of benefit to developers and designers who were stuck in the synchronous way of doing things.

B00004RLD7|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. This is where I first discovered Lauren Bacall, and it made me a fan. Even though I am a HUGE fan of Marilyn, I still was very interested in Lauren, so that should tell you something about her performance in this. Lauren's character is bold, blunt, sulky, and serious, while still remaining funny. Lauren, MM, and Betty Grable are simply three models on the prowl for a very rich husband. Bacall is the one who is most serious & really wants a millionaire. Grable is funny & very daffy in it. She is just on the brink of slow, stupid, & dumb. She gave a good performance. MM is half-blind & is her usual innocent, breathy self. I do feel that the film treated her as 3rd in importance. I wanted more scenes of her. I personally don't consider this her best or my favorite performance/character, bcz as I said there doesn't seem to be so much focus on her, but she is still watchable. I also liked the movie bcz you get to see what a swanky apartment in '50's NY looks like- and in my opinion, (as the girls would say) \\"It's just creamy!\\" (Creamy means very good). And you see how a fashion show was in the '50's. This is a funny movie mixed with good performances, and great one-liners from Bacall's character (If you don't marry the man, you haven't caught him, he's caught you). I definitely recommend it.

This movie will go down as a romance classic- a forbidden love about two people from the wrong side of the tracks-Romeo and Juliet for the 1940's, if you will.  This film hits all my cheesy love spots and turn up aces with me.  McAdams/Goslin were great as well as Garner and Rowland.  This is a must see for all Chick movie lovers.  Highly recommended.

1860463657|5.0|Arthur Koestler has called this novella \\"a minor masterpiece.\\"  He writes,  \\"[The use of the word 'minor'] was meant to refer to the small size of the book, and to the impression that although its theme was the ugliest tragedy in man's history, it was written in a nostalgic minor key\\" (Introduction, Fontana Books edition, 1977).  Having now read this amazingly moving journey of a friendship, I can only agree with Koestler's assessment of this work as a masterpiece.  Mr. Uhlman has keenly expressed the depth of friendship with all of its joys and fears.  His descriptions reminded me of the beauty of Hesse's own romantic language:  \\"...the Black Forest where the dark woods, smelling of mushrooms and the tears of amber-colored mastic, were threaded through by the trout streams with sawmills on their banks.\\"  Mr. Uhlman has also deftly expressd the philosophical wanderings of two young men who attempt to find meaning in the world around them as their understandings are transformed because of the naturalness of their friendship.  This terribly good story is not over-emotional, nor melodramatic.  It conveys some seriousness and a touch of irony.  This is indeed a marvelous--albeit brief--masterpiece.
B000RJO578|5.0|And to think I almost passed this up because I wasn't quite sure I'd enjoy it. Well, it's the most fun movie I've seen in years. If you like naughty British humor with a bit of gore thrown in, this is for you. It reminded me a bit of \\"Waking Ned Devine\\". Very witty and a great story with camp spoof thrown in. A village of wackos hiding a secret that only an over the top officer OF THE LAW can handle. The police force--er, police SERVICE of Sandford is something to behold. Get this movie asap. It's a hoot. Don't worry too much about the dialog, I thought it was fun even not being able to get every word. The extras on the DVD are not to be missed. \\"Trivia facts\\" are great and the \\"TV show\\" with the dubbings is a riot. I'm ordering it for the collection today. Oh, and of course, I must get \\"Sean of the Dead\\" asap!
B000LC4TJ0|1.0|I read all the reviews about this Le Nozze di Figaro and bought it anyway paying top dollar.  Boy, am I sorry!!!  Every negative comment made by other reviewers is, unfortunately, true.  The music is too slow, the staging and costumes are dull, the performances are unhappy--even tortured, and the addition of the \\"guardian angel\\" is beyond irritating.  This unnecessary and unwelcome creature appears in scene after scene pushing the players onto the ground, jumping on their backs, showering them with feathers, ad nauseum.  Let's not forget the dead crows tossed out the window.  And what's with Harnoncourt himself?  The orchestra members are dressed to the nines in tuxedos and he's wearing a black shirt.  I guess that's a statement, too.    I would wish that, in the future, when great performers like Anna Netrebko get a glimpse of a part in a potential production like this, they will just say, \\"No!!!!!!\\"
0743424425|5.0|The Shining is one of Stephen King's best ever books.  He has written some of the best modern fiction in the past 35 years, and some of the worst, as well, but few of his books equal this one.  This book is flat out scary and will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end.  Some of the scenes featuring young Danny Torrance in the haunted hotel are truly gripping and will have you reaching for the light switch.  Which reminds me, this is not a book to read in the dark with a flashlight.  Turn the lights on, all of them.  This is one scary ride, filled with believable characters, spot on dialogue, and incredibly frightening situations that will have you gripping the pages until your knuckles turn white.

B000OY8NII|5.0|My family loves Eureka.  We don't have access to the Sci-Fi channel, so we took a chance and bought the series on DVD.  It's really quirky and seems to have endless possibilities for story lines.  The acting is good and the characters interesting.    The only problem is the packaging. The back says it is made from \\"a combination of starch, cellulose and water (commonly known as potatoes).\\" It is supposed to be \\"eco-friendly\\", which seems wonderfully inventive, but the trays shed.  We were having trouble with the DVD freezing and discovered little pieces of the tray all over the DVD.  Also, as soon as I opened the packaging, the first DVD fell out because the tray can't keep it secure.  I will probably just put the DVDs in another holder to keep them clean.  Maybe it would be better to download the series from Amazon and use your own sleeves.    Anyway, the series is fun, original, and imaginative.  Can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD!
B000QQFKYE|4.0|With his 179 minute INLAND EMPIRE, writer/director/sound designer/camera operator David Lynch has created an intricate Polish melodrama, Hollywood mystery, and meditation on movies.  A Hollywood crew, led by actors Laura  Dern and Justin Theroux and director Jeremy Irons, is remaking a Polish film that was abandoned because the leading actor and actress were murdered.  Or were they?  Was the film even made?  And will Dern and Theroux meet a similar fate if it was made?  INLAND EMPIRE is a challenging and fascinating film, vast and immensely enjoyable if you give it undivided attention.  That is asking a lot, but it is worth the effort.  As with all Lynch films, the sound design is awesome and the use of color (Lynch studied painting) is flawless.     So we have a Polish film and a Hollywood film playing out for three hours on parallel narrative tracks.  It doesn't all make sense.  I still don't understand the sitcom with characters wearing donkey head masks.  I think that is just something that Dern watches.  Or maybe it is part of the Hollywood movie, along with the superb monologues Dern has with her psychiatrist.  (One of the best is regrettably on the cutting room floor, but part of the bonus material on disk two.)  Maybe Dern and Theroux metamorphose into their Polish counterparts or their Hollywood film characters.  It all ends with a wrap party, if that helps you.    Disk two runs a full three-and-a-half hours and includes a real-time cooking lesson (!), something called \\"Ballerina\\", three theatrical trailers, a stills gallery, about 90 minutes of sometimes excellent cutting room floor footage, a filmmaking documentary, and a lengthy monologue by Lynch with his favorite movie stories.  INLAND EMPIRE doesn't all make sense to me, but it is one of the few difficult movies to warrant a second viewing.  Every new movie playing in theaters now seems like dog food compared to this David Lynch steak.  Or quinoa.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini takes us on a remarkable journey which most of us can hear about but never know - that of the world of women in a conservative Muslim country such as Afghanistan under the Taliban rule.     Of course, this a fictional account and therefore it isn't about political or historical facts so much as the ability of the author to create memorable characters with whom you can connect at a heart level. You can really feel the hardships that the women go through in this book and in that way the book does teach through our capacity to empathize.      I definitely recommend this book. Also try these books which I read before this one: [[ASIN:0374105235 A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier]], which is a remarkable story about the author who grew up as a child-soldier and Nexus: A Neo Novel a gripping book about Logan's journey in overcoming depression and suicide through inner spiritual growth.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Having just moved to Miami a few months ago and having just devoured the first two witty and inspired DEXTER books, I couldn't wait to get the DVDs of the first season of the series. I was not disappointed in the transfer from page to TV. Showtime's amazing adaptation of Jeff Lindsay's first Dexter novel (with new bits thrown in to stretch it out--satisfyingly--to a full TV season) was superb, even capturing the sardonic, darkly humorous voice of its narrator. Production values are high, the casting is inspired and on target, and the show, even when you know how things will turn out, is compelling and watchable. I recommend Jeff Lindsay's excellent novels as a companion to the series (things happen a bit differently and you get the chance to get inside the head more of what could arguably be literature's most lovable serial killer). But whether you read the books or not, this is an A+ adaptation and well worth the price of admission.

They're also selling the excellent [[ASIN:B000ASDFJU Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)]] for about $200 -- and though sometimes that price inexplicably drops or goes up by a few bucks, I've never seen it go as high as $220, which is the price they're currently asking for this one \\"collection\\".<br /><br />If you actually purchase all of these, in their flimsy plastic packaged glory for $220.00 when you could get the entire thing for as low as $140 by simply buying individually, the more fool you.  Here's hoping you're too smart to make that mistake.  And that Amazon.com will STOP DOING THIS, as this is the third time I've caught them inflating the price of a DVD collection when they come cheaper on their own.
1400063515|3.0|There are several good ideas in this book that warrant a revisit or a redescription but unfortunately, pearls of thought are often diffused by the litter of anger, snide comments about this and that, and the author's habitual prose of discontinuing the argument with side remarks and personal rambling. While I have no problem with Taleb's prose--and it was cute just before the fifth bracket containing these rambling; and by the way, please use the double dash--they become especially burdensome when you have to read through multiple pages like that in a 329 pages book excluding the bibliography wondering where you were the last you read sensibly. These continuous streams of side remarks and rambling certainly make the reader feels like an unwilling audience chained in following Taleb's own wanderlust through nothingland. But Taleb did warn the reader somewhere in the beginning that this was his own private novel--a device for synthesizing his thoughts. I guess this caveat should have been part of the title--think \\"The Black Swan: One Man Search for Understanding\\"--or this tome sent to the fiction section.<br /><br />If I have only but one content criticism reserved for this book--and it is not Taleb's wayward reading of Popper's Poverty of Historicism, which he concisely but mistakenly summarized as Popper's thesis that prediction for the social world is impossible because we are unable to predict technological innovation (gosh!)--then it is his major claim on the fallaciously severe, knowledge-impeding concept known as the narrative fallacy.<br /><br />Unless I am mistaken, Taleb seemed to have made one self-contradicting claim here. For only through conjecturing--the act of constructing a series of explanations of some phenomenon that may resemble a narrative--can less robust conjectures be refuted and new knowledge constructed. But if like Taleb, one argues that narratives are fallacious for aiding knowledge growth, then there remains no other way for us to reconstruct some explanation of the past, and by doing so, nothing to be refuted and therefore no knowledge gained.<br /><br />Unless of course, Taleb understood this point outright and mangled the book in a way such that no major argument, even less a narrative, could be gleaned from it after many frustrating but precious hours of a reader's time.<br /><br />I give one star for the attempt at tackling an interesting topic that in the hands of a more committed, and yes, more grave thinker with better command for the jewels of thought littered across human history, would have been a mind-warping work; and I also give one star for the excellent and extensive bibliography that has been underserved as a pretty vase for this book.<br /><br />For such an interesting topic with major repercussions for the existence of human beings in the coming ages of grave uncertainties, who would want to take such an entertaining but unthoughtful approach? For this Taleb should learn something about representation from the book jacket artist, whose designs I give one star as well in both editions of this book.nation of the past, and by doing so, nothing to be refuted and therefore no knowledge gained.

0385338082|1.0|I honestly have to say this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Don't get me wrong - I loved the Undomesticated Goddess (LOVED IT!!!), but this book pales by comparison. I am truly confused by the many 5 star reviews here. I would have given this a zero if it was possible. I have read hundreds of these type books, and this one was by far the worst.<br /><br />The book started out great. I had some really good laughs and I got excited that this would be another great read. The story turned south really fast. I continued to read on because this book had received so many 5 star reviews here that I had hopes it would improve, sadly to say it just got worse and worse. When I finished I was so disappointed.<br /><br />I didn't feel any attachment at all to any of the characters, especially not Jack. Actually the only one I felt something for was Connor. I felt bad for him especially since Emma lies to him and then dumps him like yesterdays trash. She starts dating the boss where they both work in front of all Connor's co-workers, how humiliating for poor Connor!!!! He was the only `nice guy' I saw in this story and Emma dumped him and treated him like he was nothing to her. Am I supposed to like a character that cheats and lies to her boyfriend then dumps him and dates someone else the very next day?? Did I miss something here? I am also not sure how she could be in love with Jack after just two meetings and no communication (no sparks - no anything) The only thing that connected them was a bunch of silly secrets she shared with him on the plane. He actually came off to me as a weird type rather than a love interest type.<br /><br />There are just too many bad things about this book. The characters are undeveloped (those that were well developed where not important to the main story line at all), the `secrets' where nothing to get all in a huff about sharing BIG DEAL, Jack seemed like a stuck up jerk and not a serious love attraction, Connor got dumped while she ran around behind his back, Jacks secret he hide in the end was ridiculous .....it goes on and on in the BAD department.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book at all. It's no secret that this book was a big floop!back, Jacks secret he hide in the end was ridiculous .....it goes on and on in the BAD department.     I would not recommend this book at all. It's no secret that this book was a big floop!
1400032717|1.0|I will start off by saying that this book was not a voluntary read on my part. It was assigned to my class as required reading for incoming sophomores, and continues the trend of having students read books they can relate to in absolutely no way shape or form.     That said, I have to give my complete and honest opinion that this book sucked. It is not nice, it is not politically correct or even particularly mature, but it's the truth. This book pained me to read. You are thrust into the world of an autistic teenager with no preamble. It is never even directly stated, I might add, that the main character is autistic. You just need to figure it out from context clues that as a fifteen year old, I can say would have gone right over my head if I hadn't read reviews elsewhere. I would have just thought that man, this kid is weird, what is wrong with him?     It seems like the author got bored halfway through with the mystery and just started to create a rambling account about nothing for his own personal amusement, and possibly as a means to convey his own personal beliefs which frankly I don't want to be subjected to. It reads like he stopped trying and just started writing to finish. The fact that Christopher seems to be ruining the lives of everyone around him seemed extreme and contrived to me. The way he had sensory overloads at every other moment was drawn out and exhausting. And I have to question, if he is so frightened by crowds, new things, too much information, the color yellow, and strange men, how could he have possibly thought taking a train to London (a huge city. Filled with yellow things, I'm sure) was a good idea?    Christopher, the main character, has a tendency to overload you with information in no particular order. The author stopped short of out right stating that Christopher is flippin' brilliant, but you get the message slammed into your head loud and clear with every chapter as Christopher goes off an tangent after tangent about math and philosophy, alternately boring you and attacking your religious beliefs in the process.     Once you have finally suffered through the tedious details of Christopher's normal day, from hearing how he knows he is strong because he gave a child in his class a concussion by punching her to having him explain in minute detail how he likes his food prepared, you then are forced to sit through the big \\"mystery.\\" This mystery occupies Christopher for a time, and while initially it is disturbing (the dog was killed with a fork...), it gets old very, very fast, leaving you to focus only on the little annoying details.     I suppose I should give the author for exploring an autistic mind to the detail that he did, but it was just plain painful. Christopher seems fixated on people's bodily functions. He obsesses over color. He goes to pains to point out that he can observe the world much better than we can, because he has a photographic memory and knows math and hey, he's a genius! I might have sympathy for him if I didn't feel that the character was actively trying to make me feel like an idiot throughout the entire story, even when he was coming to conclusions that astounded me in their sheer irrationality. For such a genius, Christopher seems to make some pretty stupid errors, ones that although he is autistic I still cannot wrap my mind around, since he seems to function so well in other senses.  Another issue with Christopher's character is his self absorption. He considers no one but himself in a serious manner, and completely disregards the trouble he is causing those around him. I know that he may not have the ability to understand, but in order to feel empathy for him I need more than just an obsession with math to the exclusion of any and everything else.     If you manage to actually get beyond the poor, stilted writing, the convoluted flow of the story, and the complete and utter lack of plot and somehow finish the book, you will then find yourself beset with questionsfor which no answers are provided. Why didn't Christopher's father simply state that he was autistic? It seems like that would have prevented a lot of issues with the police, who I cannot see punishing an autistic child as they did if they knew of his autism. Why is Christopher so obsessed with his pet rat that he would risk his life to recapture him? Why did Christopher feel the need to travel to London to his mother, when Siobhan who he seems to be very close with was right in town?     Reading this book is a complete chore. And in all honesty, not to be mean or seem unkind, its apparent intention of allowing its readers to better understand how the autistic mind works failed. Instead, it left me and a number of my friends with a desire to never encounter an autistic person ever, because we don't want to get punched in the face or have knives pulled on us for no apparent reason. And frankly, assigning this book as required reading to a mass of high school students is just inviting a round of making fun of autism.     Christopher is a child my own age, which is an improvement over last years required reading. However, the horrible writing, multitude of tangents, focus on the insignificant and the leaps of logic that are simply put stupid alienate him from the reader to a degree that it is impossible to relate to him. He is autistic, but having an autistic narrator does not excuse many of the books flaws. After suffering through trying to bend your mind to fit his in an attempt to understand what is happening and having it slammed into your head that Christopher is smarter than you are, you are left staring at the last page of the book and thinking....what the hell?

0316166685|5.0|I have recommended this book to many friends and teens. I recieved my first copy from my sons girlfriend.I liked the book so much that I loaned it to my daughter, but, before she had a chance to read it, her friends had asked if they could borrow it and so it started its journey into the unknown. I bought the book again so I could let other friends read it and now have purchased it again so my daughter can finally read it. Everyone that I have given the book to then gives it to someone else to read. I do not want to give anything away about the book but it is being told by a spirit and one can only wonder. Absolutly gripping.
0060557818|5.0|I've always enjoyed fantasy fiction, and thrillers. Combine both, and throw in a good sprinkling of self-deprecating humor, and you have the wonderful read: Neverwhere.    I can't tell you how much I loved this book - I didn't want it to end. The world of Door, and Islington, and Croupe and company is entertaining, inventive, and imaginative. I love books where you are actively challenged to use your imagination, but to do so as smartly and whimsically as in Neverwhere is a total joy.    Set aside a few hours to read -- this is a can't-put-it-down-read-until-you-are-dizzy thrill of a book. I can't recommend any recent fantasy book more heartedly, I loved it.

B000AP04NI|5.0|Oklahoma! (I didn't forget the exclamation point in the title) is a great musical and a great movie. Not wimpy or silly in the slightest, this Rodgers and Hammerstein story rocks! From good music and strong characters and performances, to a setting that carries the gaze out toward the all-but endless sky, to one of the most delightfully macabre and humorous tunes ever penned, the \\"Pore Jud Is Daid\\" piece used in the scene in which the hero, Curley, tries to talk the villainous Jud Frye into suicide by invoking images of the lovely funeral he'd have...that had me rolling. Oklahoma! is a darn good old-fashioned sort of production, and I bet it'll pleasantly surprise a lot of first-time viewers as much as it did me.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Read reviews for months before the release of \\"300\\".  Was worth the wait.  Movie was fantastic. (I'm a 63 year old woman).  Already have 3 copies of the DVD just in case.

B000QUUD60|2.0|If you already have the previous special edition do not buy this. The first disc duplicates exactly that release. The 2nd disc whilst having a few interesting extras is the original release. This is poor quality as compared to the first disc, and duplicates the concert again (if you already own the previous special edition).<br /><br />I'm afraid this is just a money making exercise to cash in on the 30th anniversary of his death.
B000QGDIKM|4.0|It seems that most people say that this album is part \\"Zwan\\" and part \\"The Future Embrace\\". That's just stupid. They are just saying that to sound like they are smart because they know what Billy Corgan was up to while the Pumpkins were disbanded.<br /><br />This album sound like Smashing Pumpkins and not like Corgan's other projects. Although, I'm not sure it's better than \\"Zwan,\\" thankfully, it's better than \\"The Future Embrace.\\"<br /><br />Since Corgan was the brain behind the operation, I don't think the album is the way it is because there's no D'arcy or Iha. If you recall Machina and Machina II, this sounds like an album that might have followed it a couple years later even if they didn't break up.<br /><br />I still enjoy a good Pumpkins CD, but like others, I miss the days of Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie. Zeitgeist has the rock songs like those of old, but the melodies and softer side is a bit lacking.<br /><br />Over all, once I got familiar with the CD, I have realized that I genuinely do like it. It's got some good solid rock that I'm sure to enjoy listening to over and over.
B000000Y2R|4.0|This recording is an essential addition to any serious Jazz collection, capturing as it does five Jazz giants recorded together for the one and only time.<br /><br />Charlie Parker is on Alto Sax, Dizzy Gillespie Trumpet, Bud Powell Piano, Charles Mingus bass and Max Roach on drums. From the first number \\"Perdido\\" you know this something special. A medium tempo version which never stops swinging. Gillespie in particular is in fiery form on this number. On \\"Salt Peanuts\\" Bud Powell plays a memorable solo, which precedes a thunderous drum solo from Max Roach.<br /><br />The atmosphere is fantastic with the crowd applauding the musicians solos, and sometimes you can hear the musicians cajoaling each other to better performances. Considering the recordings are over fifty years old the sound is pretty good. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because there is a newer 'complete' version of this recording.<br /><br />Sadly Max Roach the last surviving member of the this quintet has just died.

B000053V7Q|5.0|1970, Las Vegas, flushed with the success of the 68 comeback special and the subsequent Memphis album Elvis put on this series of scintillating shows. The DVD collects the best performances from these shows, together with a lot of rehearsal footage and what you get is a fascinating film showing you Elvis still *pretty much at the top of his game. Critically Elvis seems to be in charge of whats going on with the music. Watch the early rehearsal scenes and you will see a man who knows exactly what he wants. Whether its telling the backing singers what they need to do or sorting out musical arrangements.<br /><br />I say *pretty much because for me Elvis peaked with the 68 comeback special. Here he has put on a few pounds in weight, and perhaps most critically the rock n roll material doesn't seem to work as well as the rip roaring black leather set from the 68 show.<br /><br />The backing band on these shows was truly superb. I have watched Suspicious Minds many times and the drummer is amazing. In fact you can see that Elvis was probably a frustrated drummer himself as he is equally absorbed with the fills the drummer plays at the of every \\"because I love you so much baby\\". James Burton is on guitar and that is another reason to buy the DVD as he is one of the great unsung heros of rock n roll guitar playing.<br /><br />So overall you get Elvis still close to his peak, giving mostly great performances. The DVD is in proper widescreen cinema ratio (2.35:1) and the picture quality is excellent for a 37 year old film. This is the best Elvis DVD to buy after the 68 comeback special.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|As a long-time lover of traditional Disney hand-drawn animation, I never thought I'd see a CGI film that would capture the magic of the Disney classics. I hate that shiny, garish look that the lesser films -- and even some of the major films -- have had. And while I love photo-realism when it's used for live-action effects, it seems pointless in animation. I spend my life in reality. When I watch a cartoon I want to be transported to a different environment, one I''ve never seen in real life like Snow White's forest or the Beast's castle. For a long while, all CGI animated movies looked alike. I missed the wonderful painterly backgrounds (Okay. I'm an artist myself, so I'm biased.) While I've certainly enjoyed all of Pixar's films, they didn't really inspire me. But now the technology has expanded enough so that filmmakers can do almost anything. \\"Ratatouille\\" is a marvel! Visually, it looks like art. While the lighting is photo-realistic, everything else is wonderfully stylized and painterly. Of course, this would be simply a nice technological breakthrough if it weren't paired with such a warm, witty script and superb animation and direction. \\"Ratatouille\\" succeeds on every level. Even the music is wonderful. On the one hand it's as sophisticated as a Billy Wilder comedy; yet, I saw it with an audience of toddlers and they seemed transfixed. \\"Shrek the Third\\" is film for the moment. \\"Ratatouille\\" is one for the ages! Very highly recommended!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Zodiac is very well made, written and acted film.  While there is no definitive conclusion and the movie runs a bit long, it remains engrossing from begining to end.  All of the actors here (and there are many) do excellent work. Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Jr. are excellent.  Sevigny and Gyllenahhal have a nice chemistry in their scenes.  The script is intelligent and detailed (not without some humor)and surprisingly suspenseful at times. Great detail to time an place also add to the treats in store.  Well worth a view.
0446364495|1.0|I remember when this book came out and later the movie, there was so much hype surrounding it. I came across it recently and decided to read it. The author starts by telling us that Francesca's two children came to him with a story to tell and needed his help to tell it. We are then told about Robert Kincaid, a photographer for National Geographic and the fateful meeting between him and Francesca as he is photographing the covered bridges in Madison County. After their story, we are then told about the author tracking down a jazz musician that knew Kincaid in his later years. The reader is led to believe that the story is real, with only some unknown details added in.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this \\"story\\" needed to be told. Every character is a work of fiction. There were no children, no Francesca or Robert. The story itself is even hard to grasp even if one suspends reality. It is a tale of adultery that is hard to believe. I'm usually a sucker for sloppy sentimentality, but this one just didn't grab me.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|The photography was superb, a beautiful showing of a planet that whose scenes may very well not exist in even ten more years. However, the audio is frustrating. The background music in places is so loud that the narration can not be understood. Your alternative is reducing the picture size so that the DVD subtitles will display. When you are watching a visual masterpiece, who wants to have to read subtitles?
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Not aware of the novel from which the movie was based, I watched this film cold --- not knowing what to expect or how the plot would unfold. I was immediately swept-up in the grandeur of the film. Perfume is beautifully filmed, with the rich textures and imagery not often found since the days of the Italian filmmakers such as Felini, Visconti and Zefferelli.<br /><br />The story and plotline become more of a parable as the story unfolds, and this will confuse the casual viewer as some of the other reviews have shown. The ending is a perfect conclusion to a \\"Brothers Grimm Fairy Tale\\" of one's need to exist and have self worth. The performance of Dustin Hoffman is simply outstanding, one of his best in recent memory. Allan Rickman is excellent also. The young Britisher, Ben Whishaw has found his defining role, and this will establish him in American's eyes.<br /><br />Truly a great surprise in a video release, that unfortunately, did not enjoy wide acceptance during it's theatrical run.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I really like this a lot. I love that i can move it easily from one stoller to another. It holds what I need and has a little mesh zipper part for my keys & cash. i also like that i can take it off and throw in the bottom of my stroller when parking it at theme parks, the aqaurium etc. I would have rated it a 5 but the only thing I don't love is that the straps should have an attachemet or extender so it fits double joggers better. I have to put it on side  when i have it n my double jogger and it looks funny, but functions great.

074356619X|4.0|I was hoping for a positive CD to prepare me for shoulder surgery and help me deal with negative people at work.  This book was exactly as description offered and a big help.  I followed Rhonda's advice and corrected my mental messages to only positive ones.  \\"Heathly recovery\\" and \\"Thank you for keeping my shoulder numb and calm\\" rather than \\"pain-free\\".  I also keep positive mantras in my head when I start my day and I KNOW I am ATTRACTING POSITIVE situations rather than repelling negative people and conversations.  I am recovering beautifully from my surgery and the pain was so minimal I was astonished! I have attracted the right therapists - within walking distance from my home!!!!  It's all up to me, It's all up to you!  Thank you for reading my notes and know you have lots of people around you to share your personal success!
B000QXDED6|1.0|It may do well by the graphic novel it is based on, but for anything else---well it is simply terrible. A wreckless work for all mankind. The dignity it lacks would shame a Spartan.
B00005ND42|4.0|The artistry on this set is of astonishingly high quality. Oistrakh's playing is sweet and true, and flawless. Oborin's playing is precise and articulate. Their ensemble is outstanding, they are completely in synch, and their attention to dynamics is completely literal and exact. Why not 5 stars then? Because gnawing away at me is the thought that Beethoven requires more  intensity, even in the early sonatas. Maybe he requires not as much intensity as you get with the electrifying dynamism of Argerich and Kremer, or even with the unique introspective virtuosity of Mutter and Orkis. Oistrakh and Oborin, for all their musicality and technical perfection, make this music sound like Mozart, like it was written for an 18th-century drawing room. Beethoven may have started out in the 18th century, and his music may have been played in drawing rooms, but for sure, it wasn't written for salons and drawing rooms. As good as this set is--and I'm glad it is now available in digitally remastered format because I think highly of these performers--the music needs something more.

B000000XB9|5.0|So often we read the hype of a groups \\"Greatest\\" hits CD's and when we listen we ask ourselves 'What was so great about that?'.  Not so with this CD.  This group is such a part of our early lives (for those of us over 50) and still the music is fresh.  A must have for CCR fans.
B000MZHW1S|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie but I also think it was limited and pretty sappy. Leonardo DiCaprio was very good as the young mercenary. Djimon Hounsou has a good look but I don't think he is a very good actor beyond that. Jennifer Connelly is the same. She is not a very good actress. This movie does expose or bring to the mainstream public the story of the blood diamond trade. That is commendable. But I think it got to be a bit sappy and a bit of a 'feel good' movie. I enjoyed it for the most part but think it was kind of unrealistic in its hollywood feel good 'happy ending'.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is my new favorite CD and will be in that position for some time to come.  The combination of Eric and JJ's talent is a perfect example of the Gustalt theory where the end result is more than the sum of the parts.  My 76 year old mother wants her own CD after hearing mine and my college son already has a copy.  How's that for music that crosses the generations?
B00005N7Z1|3.0|This movie still holds up. It is great fun and extremely violent. The villians are just about as slimey, hateful and evil as they come. Ronnie Cox is great in a turn from his usual nice guy roles of the past. All the special effects and Weller in that big old clunky costume are just great. I enjoyed this movie in the theater many years ago and it still holds up. Lots of tongue in cheek stuff mixed with some ultra violent insanity.

Will Ferrell should stick to his goofy comedy movies because this movie was boring and pretty much was a snooze fest.

The title track for me is the main attraction and showcases the very underrated talents of Eddie Hazel who in my opinion is one of the finest guitar players to walk this earth.

B000N6U0E2|3.0|This was a nice little 'feel good' movie. It never tries to be anything but that and hits right on the old heart strings. It is suppose to be based on a true story which in todays world might have meant that a white guy applied for a job and was a track star and they got this movie out of that story. I think that Will Smith was going for Tom Cruises record of being the greatest runner in the history of cinema. Smith, who I don't think is a great actor but who does an adequate job runs, runs and runs some more thru this entire movie. His little kid is perfectly cast again as the 'little cute kid' who tugs those tear ducts and pulls at your heart.<br /><br />Not a great movie but a good feel good movie.

B000NVL9FQ|5.0|If you check my older reviews, I gave the Rhino disc a great review but the improvement here even over that one is astounding.  I don't think I've ever heard clearer vocals on my system - how the hell did these guys record this album so well, a DEBUT album no less?  On my rig, sibilants are outstanding, smooth as silk and not harsh at all - it IS a brightly-mixed album, after all, and your speakers' high end had better be up to the challenge.  The soundstage is also a mile wide and just when I thought I knew every musical nuance of this album, I found myself hearing \\"further back\\" into the recording than ever before - stunning.  This also makes me realize just how BAD those old Atlantic CDs were.  And I have heard the K2 and sorry, but for my taste the treble is just a bit bright and the music sounds slightly compressed to my ears.  Horses for courses, as long as we all enjoy the album, guys.  Right?      And with that, let me publicly state that I will NEVER buy another version of this album on CD.

B000UX6THK|5.0|I remember the excitement when I learned that the first season was being released on DVD.  I'd been waiting for that moment for a really long time.  Then, I heard that the pilot wasn't included, the thrill was gone and I decided I wouldn't be getting it after all.  I then started looking into the possibility of just buying the series on VHS.  Around that same time, I started to hear a few rumblings of a complete set being released some time in the future.  I decided to wait and see because I would rather have a complete set.    Fortunately, as I was clicking through the bestsellers list, my jaw dropped as my dream finally came true ... the complete and beautiful series that is Twin Peaks.  I've already pre-ordered it and I can't wait for October 30th to roll around.    As for the extras, as much as I would like to see 10 discs worth of extras, I will happily settle for having the entire series on DVD.  It's still worth it to me (especially since this gold box set costs less than the two seasons bought together ... with the added bonus of the pilot!!!).
B000MKXEME|5.0|Stuart Gordon's first is a must see. Definitely If your big on horror, If yout not well don't. Great film that's totally over the top but in the way that it should be. It has it's oh s@*t moments. The effects in this movie are great to this day, ofcourse they are. They were never bad effects to begin with. The story is obviously great and is based on H.P Lovecraft's series of stories , Herbert West The Re-Animator. The acting, direction, and cinematography is to die for. I'd say it's a hell of a film premiere. I'd be proud to hail this as my film If I'd directed it. I'm sure Stuart Gordon is. If your into movies like Scanners, The Thing , Return Of The Living Dead, or any of Romero's zombie films check this out. Definitely If your someone who likes vintage horror movies.

B000N3T0DW|3.0|Along with \\"El Laberinto del fauno\\" and \\"Babel\\", \\"Volver\\" (2006)- written and directed by Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almod&oacute;var tale of family ties, hidden secrets, deaths, and forgiveness is a disappointment for me. One of the most praised and showered with the awards films from last year, \\"Volver\\", is IMO dull, non-compelling, and often laughable when supposed to be sweet, moving, and dramatic. I see what Almodovar was trying to do in \\"Volver\\". It is his own \\"Amarcord\\", his tribute and loving dedication to the women in his life, his admiration for mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts; for eternal femininity as a driving force of life, for women's love, strengths, understanding, and their complicated but caring relationships. \\"Volver\\" is above all about the closest, the most tender and most complex relationship two women may have, that of a mother and her daughter, and how far a mother would go to protect her child, her girl who is always a little girl for her no matter how old she is, and how much a mother would regret and blame herself for not having noticed things that would ruin her child's life and forever alter in the most devastating ways the child's love and trust for her mother.<br /><br />In \\"Volver\\" (\\"To Return\\" in English), a mother (Irene, played by Carmen Maura) comes from dead to resolve the problems and to settle the affairs she could not finish during her life and by doing so, she would repair and re-vitalize her relationship with her daughters (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz, in an Oscar-nominated performance, and Lola Due&ntilde;as in an understated, subtly humorous performance) and her teenage granddaughter (Yohana Cobo, Cruz's daughter).<br /><br />\\"Volver\\" is also the writer/director's love letter to the Italian films of 50th and 60th with the great stars Anna Magniani and Sophia Lauren shining as strong earthy beautiful and sensual women - mothers. It is for that reason, in one of the scenes of \\"Volver\\", Irene watches on TV an old movie, \\"Bellissima\\" (1951) directed by Luchino Visconti with Anna Magnani as a mother who desperately tries to make her little girl's life better than hers. It is also for the same reason, Penelope Cruz had to put on few pounds for her Raimunda and to use a prosthetic device that artificially enhanced her rear end and widened her hips which along with her huge dark eyes and voluptuous sex appeal made her look like Sophia Loren's of the \\"Two Women\\" (1960 ) re-incarnation. I am gladly joining the legion of viewers for whom Cruz was a revelation in her third Almodovar's film. She's never looked more stunning and I am sure that she is a much better actress in Spanish films where she is natural, confidant, comfortable, and commands the screen. \\"Volver\\" has been her best achievement so far. Her Oscar nomination is well deserved as the Cannes Best Actress award to the female ensemble cast is. All performances in \\"Volver\\" are above average and deserve the praise.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I think Almodovar went too far in his idolizing and idealizing women and depicting all males in the movie as no good, cheating, and abusive evil presence. His verdict for them - they don't deserve to live. Not only that, the men in \\"Volver\\" don't even deserve their mysterious disappearances and/or suspicious deaths be investigated properly because nobody seem to care, and the least - Pedro Almodovar. He is too busy to photograph the women kissing each other so often that it becomes irritating and annoying.<br /><br />While watching the film, another famous European director, no less ambitious with the distinguished style, came to my mind - Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Almodovar has been often compared to Fassbinder because of similar for both directors' approach in creating iconoclastic films with elements of gay and counter culture incorporated into mainstream genres; the films that masterfully combine violence and sensuality, sentimental melodrama and soap opera with dark comedy, and the ambitious use of prime colors. Both directors have made wonderful movies about women. While Fassbinder was able to show his admiration for but never idealization of women, Almodovar was not fully successful in his latest film due to the story which is inconclusive, non-logical, often implausible, and more than often simply non-involving with many plot lines never been resolved, many questions never been answered, and with the ending, abrupt like in the middle of the conversatione wonderful movies about women.

B000G759LW|1.0|Who enjoyed Christina better when she was the (how to put this in a printable manner?) the more risque X-Tina? These songs are a menage of Big Band jazz, pseudo-R&B, and just not fun to listen to. I know, for so many people this album is some grand homage to Aretha, Diana Ross, Sammy Davis Jr. and that's fine if that's what you wish to listen to. But for me, when I want to hear Christina, I want the \\"Genie in the Bottle\\" \\"Dirrty\\" girl who rocks the hell out of any modern lyrics. I adored her when she first came out as an antithesis to all of the little pseudo-virgin pop tarts who had come out at the same time but who had no substance to their music (or personalities) and who served as nothing more than Lolita-esque fantasty bate for the 40 something fathers out there. Ms. Aguilera has mind blowing pipes, great soul, a harsh background which lends credibility to her songs of pain and sorrow. This album shows off her very impressive vocal range. However, I simply feel that the material feels too retro (go ahead, blast me for this) and doesn't allow her to produce some great songs for the modern era.
0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris writes clearly and succinctly. His prose is a joy to read.    In this book he makes a compelling case for regarding religion as a form of mass hysteria based on nothing more than unquestioning acceptance of ancient dogma. He does not deny that many people have found consolation in religion but says that this is mainly because they have  not taken the time to  reflect upon their situation. Whatever is the point is offering up prayers because you have been saved from an earthquake when by the same token you believe that god caused it in the first place? And how about all of your neighbours who perished?    He effectively refutes the charge that atheism is itself a form of belief. It is nothing the sort. In Harris' view it is nothing of the sort: it is a negation of the absurdities retailed in the magic books of Islam, the New and the Old Testaments.     Harris makes his points clearly and forcefully. He does not employ technical language. Any thoughtful person concerned by the rise of religious fundamentalism around the World today will do themselves a favour by reading this book.    David Amies

006054094X|2.0|As engaging as this book is, Menzies hangs his theories on the thinnest of threads.  He is not the only one to put forward the argument that the Chinese reached American soil long before Columbus. Paul Chiasson puts forward a similar argument in [[ASIN:0312362056 The Island of Seven Cities: Where the Chinese Settled When They Discovered America]].  However, Menzies takes it a step further, saying the remarkable voyages of Zheng He circumnavigated the globe and reached the Carribean as well.  But, by a malicious turn of history all these marvelous records were banished by a vengeful emperor.  At times, I thought I was reading The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen.<br /><br />By most historic accounts, the exploration voyages of Zheng He took in a remarkable portion of the globe, that reached all the way to Africa, but stretching these voyages out the way Menzies has defies all conventional accounts, as it would have been impossible to take in a voyage as extensive as Menzies would like us to believe within a span of two years.  The ships were huge and the flotillas large, but probably not as large as Menzies would have us believe.  It is very difficult to fathom junks 450 feet in length when the average ship of the time was 75 feet in length.  My guess is that the Chinese measurements were improperly transcribed into English measurements, as most historic accounts place the Chinese treasure ships between 150 feet and 275 feet length, still much larger than the Portuguese caravels or any other ships of the era.<br /><br />Of course, you can choose to believe Menzies or not.  There seems to be a growing consensus view that the Chinese did indeed reach the West Coast of America.  Daniel J. Boorstin thought it possible in [[ASIN:0394256336 The Discoverers]], but put forward the more probable hypothesis that some ship or ships got separated from these large flotillas and happened upon the Pacific Northwest.  Unfortunately, Menzies chose to take a less structured approach to his narrative, putting forward a number of hypotheses and suppositions in the form of a history, with very little corroborating proof.arrative, putting forward a number of hypotheses and suppositions in the form of a history, with very little corroborating proof.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|Pure Reason Revolution is a very promising new band that hails from the United Kingdom.  They do not like to categorize themselves into a specific genre but if I were going to do it, I would say something like: Space-Prog-Folk Rock.  Each song on the album has such great musicianship, and shows that these brits certainly know their way around writing catchy and melodic tunes!  If you are a fan of Porcupine Tree, Pink Floyd, Radiohead or any bands similar to those, you will love PRR.    What I love about this band is how they do not focus on a certain aspect or instrument in their songwriting; they focus on the song as a whole.  Of course there are certain times when some aspects are more at the center of attention than others, but you cannot just say \\"Oh their songwriting is based on guitars (pianos, vocals etc).\\"      The two main vocalists are exceptionally catchy.  They have more of the modern vocal style that's sort of pop-sounding, which is in no way an insult.  I usually am not a big fan of female vocalists but I love the contrast between male and female vocals throughout the albums; her having a great voice doesn't hurt either!    To keep it short, I am going to be keeping an eye out for this band.  Seeing how they can write songs this great on their first album, there is no way this band will stay un-heardof for long!

0316067598|2.0|This book rubbed me the wrong way.  Luttrell and his three Navy SEAL team members deserve our love and gratitude for their valor, no question.  My problem with the book is the way Luttrell digresses from his story to blame the \\"liberal media\\" for his team's disastrous mission and the deaths of his three comrades.      Briefly, the four stumbled upon an adult and two teenage goat herders - all of them unarmed - high in the Hindu Kush soon after deploying on their mission to capture/assassinate a known Taliban leader. Having satisfied themselves the three were not Taliban, the SEALS opted not to kill them and sent them on their way. Soon after, the team was ambushed by more 150-200 Taliban and fought a heroic but desparate battle against unimaginable odds.  Only Luttrell escaped. He was taken in, fed, cared for and protected by local villagers until his rescue by Army Rangers.     Luttrell cast the deciding vote sparing the lives of the goat herders, who apparently tipped off the Taliban, and is is now wracked by sleepless guilt.  He lays the blame for the deaths of his three comrades on military rules of engagement prohibiting the killing of unarmed civilians.  Moreover, he faults the U.S. media and \\"Liberals\\" for these rules, asserting that they are unrealistic in a war zone like Afghanistan where civilians and combatants are indistinguishable.      The book is laced throughout with gratuitous assaults on \\"politicians,\\" \\"the media,\\"  \\"Liberals\\" and \\"Lefties\\" whom he argues are more concerned about amorphous, \\"so-called human rights\\" than the lives of soldiers sent into conflict without the necessary leeway to kill at will. Luttrell claims he would have voted to shoot the goat herders had he not been fearful of vilification by the press and prosecution in the courts.     This is where I part company.  If Luttrell has problems with military rules of engagement he shouldn't be in the Navy SEALS - or any other branch of the U.S. military.  The rules may be inconvenient;they may even cause U.S. casualties, but they stand for what we as Americans are about and what he was fighting to defend. We do not kill unarmed civilians.  The Taliban does; al Queda does, but we do not because that is what makes us better than them.      There are practical as well as moral reasons for this, but Luttrell doesn't dwell on those either. Nowhere does he stop to consider whether the villagers who saved him would have been so inclined if U.S. forces killed as wantonly as he believes they should be allowed to.    Luttrell's complaint with military rules of engagement rests more properly with the White House and Pentagon that sent him to Afghanistan, not the \\"liberal media\\" he relentlessly vilifies.  He might also do well to consider where his command and his team may have gone wrong.      The team deployed after two false starts because of faulty intelligence that proved faulty again.  The team was apparently unaware that the terrain they were traversing was frequented by goat herders and blew its cover almost immediately. Its radio communications failed inexplicably when they came under attack and was desperately needed.  A working radio set - or a backup, for that matter - could have saved them.     One even wonders what Navy SEALS were doing were doing high in the Himalayas in the first place; their training and strength is in amphibious assaults.  I found it sadly ironic that Luttrell's four-man team of SEALS was discovered within a day of being deployed while the 20-man team of Rangers sent to rescue them went undetected for nearly a week.      But Luttrell doesn't dwell on that either.

B000GUK72U|4.0|A lot of people will say that this is where Waters' Pink Floyd really began. And indeed, a lot of this is a blueprint for Dark Side of the Moon and all the others. But there are also some roads here that Floyd would never go down again: there's a good Simon & Garfunkle-like folk-pop number (\\"Fearless\\") that sadly dissolves into an unlistenable \\"football-chant\\" section. The Delta blues song \\"Seamus\\" is the only out-and-out blues song on a Waters-era album, and while a lot of people think it's awful, I really do like it: the \\"singing-dog\\" thing is hilarious, and it's a refreshing break from the general seriousness of this album. \\"San Tropez\\" is an experiment with '30s jazz, and it's the only real flop on the album, in my mind. It's not as bad as I used to think it was, but it's still a pretty poor showing. The songs that point to the way Floyd would be later on are my favorites: the driving, bass-heavy instrumental \\"One of These Days\\" (well, near-instrumental - there is a part where they go, \\"One of these days I am going to chop you into little pieces\\" in a processed voice, which is really cool) has an excellent guitar solo; the dreamy \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" has a perfect mood; and then there's \\"Echoes\\". You know about \\"Echoes\\", right? Eh? Eh? That is some epic stuff right there. I love every part of its twenty-three minutes: the vague lyrics; the pensive atmosphere; the heavy guitar riffs; Gilmour's slide near the end; the avant-garde freak-out section... it's a triple shot of interstellar overdrive. It's an insanely good song, debatably their best foray into extended compositions. Unbeatable song! The only reason why I give this four stars, rather than four and a half, is because it's not nearly as solid as Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, or Animals: still, it's a very respectable album.

B000002LQR|5.0|These guys are such pioneers in original sound--well, OK, before that whole Agassi thing.  On this release they show an intense edginess in their music, in their life perspectives, and their very cavalier attitude toward acceptance by the establishment.  Ironic that this is the CD that made them darlings in that arena.  They had long been unappreciated for their artistry, so it was well-deserved that this very impressive collection of tracks would elevate them to that status.  Sad to say, this released marked the end of that very hard-nosed punk attitude for them.  Every track on this CD rocks hard, even the ballads in their muted way.  I admire Kiedis for his rough-hewn lyrics and his stream of consciousness style.  He is a lyrical Bukowski.

His style is easy to read, he focuses on the practical aspects of the development process, presenting the pros/cons and applicability of each of his recommendations in a solution-focused manner.  This isn't a book marketing some theory of what's best, but really concentrates on what works, what doesn't, and how to excel as a software development professional.  His points and recommendations are clear and well-supported - and will often be eye-opening material for the reader, no matter how experienced they are in this industry.<br /><br />\\"Code Complete\\" focuses on software development as a discipline, and encourages the reader to think of it as a major component of the overall software development process, including not only the initial specification / design / build / test and deploy cycle, but designing and building the code to enhance its long term \\"maintainability\\" and \\"enhancability\\".  --- The initial deployment of an application is only the first step in its lifecycle: Mr. McConnell makes the strong case that designing and building an application without concern for its long term impact and viability is an expensive mistake.<br /><br />It's been so long snce I read the first editon \\"Code Complete\\" that I cannot compare or contrast the two, but I can say that reading this edition has reinforced and expanded-on many of the practices I adopted years ago as a result of reading this volume and [[ASIN:1556159005 Rapid Development]].

As you might expect Daphne's outgoing personality and unconventional ways of expressing herself cause an instant stir in the British elite and jeopardize her Father's chances of political success.<br /><br />Critique: Released in '03 `What A Girl Wants' is a predictable \\"chick flick\\" that exploits all the expected scenarios and pushes all the right emotional buttons that we've come to expect from this genre of film. Having that said you ask why then does it receive a -5 Star- rating? I can answer that in two words, Amanda Bynes. Nobody lights up the screen like the enchanting and talented Amanda. Add to that a delightful cast consisting of the popular Colin Firth, the lovely Kelly Preston and teen heartthrob Oliver James and you've got a movie that you'll never get tired of watching. When you're in the mood for something light, cute and heart warming this is it.

The first garment I made, a tomten, was a simple and cute hooded jacket for my baby daughter. Zimmermann is a great teacher and her quirky writing technique makes for fun reading.
B000UJCALI|1.0|I notice that the deluxe DVD for this movie has the shorter, widescreen version, instead of the longer and/or full-screen version.  Kubrick shot his last three films in full-screen, apparently his preferred format, so why not release that version along with the widescreen in one set?  And I know he shortened the movie for its British release, but why not relelease the longer one?  Or does Warner plan to release the longer and/or fullscreen version?
0618680004|3.0|Dawkins has written a thoughtful, well researched and scrupulously detailed and referenced book.  It's just that his arguments could have been made equally well in half the pages.  Worth reading regardless of your belief system, but keep your favorite caffeine source nearby.
B000J6I0VG|4.0|Great dialog aside, it felt way too small! If you're going to do a SUPER hero show, have a Super hero setting with people doing Super heroic stuff in a Super realistic shot. This movie would've gotten great ratings if it was shown on the Disney channel because it looked soooo cheep! I bought it for the story and dialog.

0618526412|5.0|\\"Seek and ye shall find,\\" Jesus is quoted as saying in the Bible.  All of us, no matter what our religious affiliation--or lack thereof--are seeking out a dream, a little piece of happiness.  Sometimes this process is conscious and sometimes a subconscious imperative drives us forward towards that piece of happiness.<br /><br />The five main characters of \\"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter\\" are all seeking their dreams in an unnamed mill town in the South in the late 1930s.  For teenaged Mick Kelly, the dream is a career in classical music that her impoverished family can't afford to provide.  For the relentless black Doctor Copeland, the dream is freedom and equality for his people.  For restaurateur Biff Brannon the dream is having children.  For vertically-challenged drifter Jake Blount the dream is a Marxist revolution to level the playing field for all people.  And last, but most important, the dream for deaf-mute John Singer is to be reunited with his long time partner Anatopolous, who was committed to an institution.<br /><br />Singer becomes the prime focus for the other four.  One by one they inadvertently seek him out and spill their wishes and desires to him, although he often doesn't understand them.  To Mick he is a secret friend who understands her.  To Copeland he is a wise man who understands the struggles of the black minority.  To Blount he is a comrade in arms for the revolution.  And to Biff he is a kindred spirit, a fellow observer of humanity.<br /><br />Yet for as much as he represents to them, they mean relatively little to Singer.  His thoughts are consumed by his love--platonic, we assume--for Anatopolous, the one he thinks understands him.  But much as Singer is a false idol to the other four, Anatopolous is a false idol for him, a lazy, selfish, slovenly person incapable of appreciating Singer's love.  In the end these troubled souls are left to pick up the pieces after the false idols shatter, as they inevitably do.  This leads each of them to make a decision and to enter a new phase of life.<br /><br />What makes this book so wonderful to read is the profound understanding of humanity shown here.  All of us at one time or another have felt the pent-up ambition Mick feels at wanting something that remains just out of reach.  We've felt the righteous anger to right a terrible injustice like Doctor Copeland.  We've felt the isolation of being the outsider like Blount.  We've all felt the confusion after a loss like Biff.  And those of us fortunate enough--or perhaps unfortunate enough--have felt the heartache of an unrequited love like Singer.<br /><br />These people all seem real because their hopes and desires are those hopes and desires we all have.  Their dreams aren't altogether different than those each of us seek, whether we're aware of it or not.  We know their longing and desperation to find someone who understands them, even if that someone is a deaf-mute who can only nod along.<br /><br />Because of that, the book touches something deep in our consciousness, something primal within all of us--the need to seek out for something greater.  The most astounding thing about \\"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter\\" is that the author was only twenty-three years old when she published this.  At a time when most of us are just getting out into the \\"real world\\" and discovering ourselves, McCullers already had it figured out.<br /><br />This is truly a literary achievement that you should seek out at your local bookseller or library at once, those who haven't already done so based on Oprah's recommendation.<br /><br />That is all.o make a decision and to enter a new phase of life.<br /><br />What makes this book so wonderful to read is the profound understanding of humanity shown here.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|For the record, the X-Men trilogy is among my favorite superhero movie collections. X-Men and X-Men United were dreams come to life...as was X-Men:The Last Stand. However...as a comic book purist,I have to agree with some of the other posts and say that X3 was a bit disappointing. Not that the action wasn't there, not that the suspense and the romance weren't there, definately not that the special fx weren't there...but I wasn't feeling the way major characters got killed off in the end, and even more agitating is the way the film ended in light of the fact that there's supposedly NOT going to be an X4. Questions are left unanswered about Phoenix and the characters she disintegrated and all we're left with is anticipation for the Wolverine spin-off and the rumored Magneto spin-off to the X-Men trilogy. Could've been a lot better.
B000RJO578|4.0|great movie to enjoy. The brits make a farce about US action flicks and nail every stupid reason why their idiotic.

B000R34V50|3.0|Well... I'm a bit nostalgic for CG shows that Bomb. Tron.. The Last Starfighter.. Final Fantasy.. Young Sherlock Holmes.. Sky Captain.. and on and on and so forth. All of which I mentioned had wonderful potential in the exploitation of this new technology. And aside of YSH above, what failed them was the rancid undercook plots and characters. YSH failed because it was trying to tell a Mature story (Murder aplenty there) around a teenager. Bad idea all around. TMNT did not give enough time to the \\"villain\\" to appreciate his goals. Not enough time for the sub flunkies to brew a convincing reason for their objectives. The movie slams on the brakes much too often to give the viewer a smooth journey. Buy this if you too are a sucker for past CG failures.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I absolutely love it!!  If you are at all a John Cleese fan or a Monty Python fan you will love \\"Fawlty Towers\\".  It is a shame they only made 12 episodes, but they are amazing.  I have seen them each about five times and I still laugh!
0380973634|5.0|I was recommended this book by my friend, and I'm not disappointed.  After reading this, I also read Stardust since it was by same author, and found Neverwhere to be better (darker).  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction, has vivid imagination, or looking for a thriller.  If you've ever been to London (I haven't), you might find this book close to home as well.
B00006AW2J|5.0|OK, let me go ahead and get this out of the way. I have problems with the two big tracks that, in the old LP days, used to end sides one and two. Musically stunning as it undeniably is, \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" nonetheless has a pretty underwhelming lyric. The disparate images Jagger tosses up initially reminded me of Lennon's vignettes from \\"A Day in the Life,\\" and maybe he did have the Beatles song partly in mind, but of course the real model is/are Dylan epics like \\"Tombstone Blues\\" and especially \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile,\\" right down to the bridgeless structure and the big, willfully repetitive chorus heaved starboard like an anchor at the end of each verse. In any case, the result is too studied, too consciously \\"poetic.\\" Jagger is a terrific lyricist, and there's a heap of effortlessly great language on this album, but in this song he's aping Dylan, and I just can't overlook this, no matter how supple a groove the band lays down.    In the case of \\"Salt of the Earth,\\" while I like the strange, rather beautiful lyric, the music doesn't really come off. Just a year later, the band tried it again with \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" another album-ending, pseudo-gospel number that has a nearly identical arrangement but which is far more successful. In hindsight, \\"Salt of the Earth\\" seems like an obvious dry run for the later, superior song.    And those are my only gripes about this magnificent record. The Stones return from their psychedelic holiday (read: 1967) to find that the cauldron of blues they'd left on the fire has swelled into a seething brew that they can feast on for winters to come. This is revolutionary music. From the diabolical \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" to the lambent \\"No Expectations\\" to wonderful oddities like \\"Parachute Woman\\" and \\"Dear Doctor,\\" the band sounds like it can break big in New Orleans and overspill in Caroline.
0803729227|5.0|I picked this book up during a trip to Cape May, NJ and it quickly became my family's favorite.  The cadence of the writing and the pictures gets my 3 year old's attention, and the underlying message is what gets mine.  Even my husband grows quiet when I read it.  The description of the fishes' \\"feathery fins\\" and sharks' \\"hideous toothy grins\\" is just perfect.    A great lesson to be learned, one small act of courage can change anyone's life and can always make a difference.
B000O178BY|5.0|Before I begin. Quick back ground on myself.<br /><br />I started listening to [NIN] when With Teeth came out march 2005.<br /><br />I was looking...and lurking for a band that would stand out...<br /><br />and walla [NIN].<br /><br />Ever since I bought all of Mr.Reznors full album releases. As well as the awesomely godly EP \\"Broken\\" and the movie sound track \\"the lost highway\\" just for the song \\"the perfect drug\\". (what can I say I support the artist and there's something more gratifying and rewarding about owning a cd)<br /><br />So I had some time to kill and what better time to kill than on my best and most fav. band of all time [NIN].<br /><br />I just finished reading all the 1 star and 2 star reviews as well as a wallop of the 3 star reviews. And this is what I have to say...<br /><br />1). People please stop itching!!!! You 1 star and 2 star bashers have no taste what so ever in music. Please please please...read with your eyes close to the god damn screen: I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER DOWNWARD SPIRAL. So stop itching about him not sounding like that album.<br /><br />2). Yes this cd is only for hardcore die hard fans of [NIN]. Yet at the same time it is accessible, experimental, and definitely worth some listens for other music lovers (who truly appreciate music) to notice how Trent feels about his own music he makes music for himself only. Which I think is great.<br /><br />3). Have you been to any of their freakin live concerts? Please if you haven't yet...do yourself a favor and do it before Trent Reznor retires..or something god forbid. Once you've gone to a concert of [NIN]... slap yourself for taking the time out to bash [NIN] and 2nd you know [NIN] owns live so don't deny it. (you hate them but you secretly love them I know you do :D)<br /><br />4). I like many (I'm not alone) hardcore [NIN] fans still have faith in Mr.Reznor. As one of the 3 star reviewers said...\\"his new band is extremely talented and more than capable\\".<br /><br />In closing...thank you for reading.<br /><br />P.S I listen to the following bands right now: Nine Inch Nails, Kill.Whitney.Dead, Horse the band, Black Light Burns, REFUSED, Trance/prog/techno, Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy, Depeche Mode, Nirvana, Megadeth (old) and many more....Kill.Whitney.Dead, Horse the band, Black Light Burns, REFUSED, Trance/prog/techno, Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy, Depeche Mode, Nirvana, Megadeth (old) and many more....
0061122092|5.0|Excentlant book, a pretty fast read with lots of meaning.  I recomment Paulo Coelho as a writer one of my favourits
0452282152|4.0|If you have ever seen \\"the Dutch Mona Lisa\\", or the \\"girl with the pearl earring\\", by Vermeer you will have been struck by it's tenderness. Maybe it is misplaced to say so about a naturalist like Vermeer, but you get the feeling he must have liked this girl. However, nobody knows who she was or why he painted her in such an un-Vermeer-like pose.    Perfect fiction material then, and Chevalier has not wasted the opportunity. The book tells the story of a 16 year old girl in the 17th century Dutch town of Delft who becomes a maid in the Vermeer family. We follow her struggle to keep her dignity in a house full of strife, culminating in the event of  her being painted (she, a maid!). I usually like first person narratives, but this is one of the best I know. The historical setting is (to me, a non-historian, but Dutch and knowing Delft) completely convincing. The story is plausible, satisfying and well composed, and the prose has a soft touch that somehow accords very well with painting itself.   The one flaw, for which I deduct a star, is that the protagonist is implausibly mature and confident for her age and social status. Another reviewer on this page remarked that the book reads better when you the girl looking back after the facts on her younger self. This is true, but a writer should not have to rely on goodwill like that.     The book reminded me of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", in storyline (although it is less brutal), the ease with which the writer makes fiction feel like reality, and the way in which it makes you wish things will turn out well for a small girl in a big world.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|Don't think about the plot much. There is one, but that is not the only thing that matters as in most of his films in the past. \\"Inland Empire\\" is all about David Lynch and his \\"ideas\\" - about his visuals, or visions, and the unnerving sound effects, surprising use of music (including Little Eva's \\"Locomotion\\" with prostitutes dancing to it), a sitcom of the cool rabbit men and their bizarre dialogues. And it goes on three hours. It could be mess for some viewers, or a big sketch book drawn by a genius for others. To me, it happens to be the latter (though I would still find the film brilliant if some parts are left in the cutting room).    In \\"Inland Empire\\" you meet Laura Dern as Hollywood star Nikki Grace, who got a role in the new film co-starred with a handsome lead (Justin Theroux), and directed by gentleman-like director (Jeremy Irons). The fact is, the film is a remake of some unfinished Polish film, which, some people say, is cursed. Strange things start to happen around her, which defies the film's narrative conventions. Compared with \\"Inland Empire,\\" \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" looks like a straight story.    Confusing as it is, however, \\"Inland Empire\\" has one thread of story, which is about the nightmare journey that Laura Dern`s character must go through. Fiction (or another world?) and reality start to merge, making Nikki lose the sense of where she is, and who she is. The same goes to the viewers, who follow the episodes apparently connected to one another, that sometimes seem repetitious, sometimes unexpectedly funny (I love those rabbit people), sometimes utterly ridiculous, but ultimately strange and mysterious.    David Lynch's talent is often associated with his unique visual styles, but he is also a great \\"actor's director\\" who often has had the actors' strongest performances, like John Hurt, Richard Farnsworth, and recently, Naomi Watts in his films. Here Laura Dern gives us one of her best performances in her career as confused Nikki, whose transformation is so painful and credible. You cannot miss smaller roles. Before Nikki, Grace Zabriskie appears as mysterious Polish lady, quietly warning of the consequences of her taking the job. This is vintage Lynch, very weird and never boring.    I know the film is deeply flawed and three hours are too long and demanding. Some part of the film is weaker, being a bit too repetitious. \\"Inland Empire\\" is shot with Sony's digital camera and has its original beauty, but I still wish someday Lynch goes back to the old media of celluloid. Still this is undeniably a David Lynch film with his extraordinary images and ideas that no one else can create.
0385336950|5.0|Somehow my high school history class on World War II missed the Japanese balloon bombs in the later days of 1944 and early days of 1945; maybe I was distracted by the cutie a couple of rows away. Nonetheless this book (and Mr.Callanan)have rectified that fact. Mr. Callanan spins a fascinating tale of life near the close of WWII involving a Catholic-raised orphan undergoing his coming-of-age, a half Russian-half Yup'ik Eskimo woman doing whatever she needs to to survive and a severly unbalanced Army captain who makes Capt. Ahab look like Walter Cronkite. The story unfolds from the perspective of Louis Belk, the former orphan, now Catholic priest, as he stands a deathbed watch over his \\"competitor\\", a Yup'ik shaman, in a series of flashbacks/flash forwards, giving him his confession about the series of events that took place those waning days of WWII. Alaska is a much a character in this book as any of the humans from it's dense cloud of mesquitos that breed in the summer melt puddles to the crystal sharp nights of its winters. A good read, hard to put down.

Bloody Nuns they were deadly!!<br />\\"Your Heart Is An Empty Room\\" - another great song with beautiful singing.<br />\\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\" - Great track<br />\\"Crooked Teeth\\" - Another great track, Have I mentioned a bad track yet, think not so that MUST TELL YOU HOW GREAT THIS ALBUM IS!!<br />\\"What Sarah Said\\" - Another fav of mine, the opening piano is absolutely gorgeous, longest track on the album at 6min 20sec and wonderful throughout.<br />\\"Brothers On A Hotel Bed\\" - Good solid track.<br />\\"Stable Song\\" - To be honest I have only listened to it a few times so I can't say too much about this one!<br /><br />So 11 tracks in all and I love 9 of them, it is a rare thing to have so many songs on an album that you would totally recommend and it speaks volumes that this album has 9 very strong tracks.<br /><br />A must for music lovers!!

075640407X|5.0|This book is truly fantastic.  If you have ever wanted to see how a hero in a book becomes a hero, then read The Name of the Wind.  In a way, it is the book I have been waiting for for years.    The characters are all developed nicely, and the plot moves of its own accord, never forced.  But the biggest draw for me is the magic system.  Finally, an author has sat down and created a truly unique system (from what I can tell) that is very well explained and easily believable.    There is not quite as much action as I would like, but that turns out to be okay because I have a feeling that Rothfuss is going to unleash some crazy stuff in the next books.  Everything in this book seems believable, and I can only remember one slightly drawn out moment, which is not bad for a 662 page novel.    The main point I would like to stress is that, if you like fantasy at all, you should buy this book.  Don't borrow it from a friend.  Purchase it.  Trust me, you are going to want to have it 15 years down the road.  And that is probably the highest praise I can give a book.

Scalzi gives you enough background on the main characters, and weaves his intricate plotline through one of the most successful excercises in \\"world building\\" that I have seen. I found myself wrapped up in the storyline, and dreaded any interruption that took me away from this book. The author has a witty, clean style of writing that is a pleasure to read, and I highly recommend another of Scalzi's novels: \\"The Android's Dream\\" which was originally published in late 2006.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring doesn't come close. Disjointed, ridiculous, plotless, ugly.  UGH. Not in the same class with Twin Peaks or Mulholland Drive. This doesn't even seem like the same director that made those movies. Weirder than weird this one was.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|Have you ever seen a movie with a plot so transparent that you can predict several scenes out?  Do you enjoy films performed by people that make you long for the relatively high quality acting of 1980's television shows like the \\"A-Team\\"?  If so, then this movie is for you.    Serioulsy, I would suggest that if you want to explore other exotic cultures and spirituality, that you save your money for a trip to South America instead of purchasing this film.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Shows that at least some Merkins recognize the inanity of their country's general world-view. Nothing is immune from the acerbic wit of the creators of this. No doubt the irony will fall flat in the land in which it was created but, for the rest of the world: F*** Yeah!
B000O174CM|2.0|The acting of Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx supplemented with the singing of Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce' - the makings of a great musical film, right?  Unfortunately Dreamgirls does not deliver.      The plot of Dreamgirls focuses on the struggle of a naive trio of talented young singers during the 1960's.  Unfortunately the film focuses much of its attention on the root cause of all evil in the U.S. during this time period - white people.  Seriously, the only time you see a caucasian or hear a reference to one during this film, it is to make the point that they racists or thieves who don't appreciate good music.    In the end, I expected a lot more from this talented cast and therefore came away disappointed.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Wow, What a job by Sir George Martin (the 5th Beatle) and son Giles!  Remember people this is a THEATRICAL SOUNDTRACK for the alien performers of Cirque Du Soleil.  The story of how the concept evolved is a great story in itself starting with George Harrison's personal friendship and common iterests with Guy Laliberte' the founder of Cirque Du Soleil.  And later embraced by surviving band members and families of band members unfortunatly not here to see this wonderful project come to life.  Now for the music.  I have been an audio entusiast most of my life.  I own many original Beatles pressings as well as both the complete Japanese Beatle Box LPs and the complete Mobile Fidelity box LP collection.  I actually do not even own \\"Beatles Love\\" on CD...yet!  I do however own it on limited edition LP.  The sound quality and mix by Sir George Martin and son Giles is sonically way beyond all I have ever heard before on any of the other very desireable LP collections I have mentioned above.  While being certainly familiar with the music I sat captivated as a child waiting to hear what is going to amaze me next.  The breath of new life and excitement cast into these classics heard by most people on our planet (and maybe other planets) many times and engrained into our heads and beings has jumped to a new level.  I can not remember the last time a \\"sound scape\\" of any kind, either produced as a music album or a theatrical soundtrack has sparked the shear emotion of great listening pleasure.  I echo most of the reviews I have read here and say \\"Don't go out and buy this, RUN out and buy it!  I will be puchasing the CD so I can use it in my car and ipod.  But in closing, get hip to the analog vinyl version its another level of the pleasure this music offers.
B000E5KJD4|5.0|I've seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway production and traveling production of this play.  The movie holds true to both and actually makes the play easier to understand.  The storyline is strong, the music well done, and the acting superb.  Even though this is a love story, this isn't a chick flick.  I thoroughly appreciated it.  And you will too.    Oh, and the video quality is second to none.  I compared this version with the version that came on HBO HD, and the picture was superior on the HD DVD.  It was a clear-cut improvement, but the edges were more well-defined on the HD DVD version.  The sound quality is also superior.  A big bonus when you consider all the singing going on.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This is a great movie.  This is our second purchase of this CD as we scratched our first one and wanted Gettysburg in our movie library.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Certainly different from its predecessor, Supremacy puts its emphasis on political intrigue and espionage rather than personal matters... most of the time. The agency here is not entirely bad anymore.    Treadstone is dismantled but its shadows still hanging heavily.    This installment is not as even as the first one. There are a couple of really emotional scenes, showing loss, anger, and redemption and they rival anything from the first movie. Then there are suspiciously long stretches devoid of emotion. The action too gets a tad lower mark. The beginnings of mad cameraman are already evident, fast cuts, crazy angles, dark and noisy action... the style, which was further `perfected' in the third film.    JB has no clear-cut friends here, acting alone, and more methodically than ever. The tale here is a bit grimmer, too.    The score now has a central theme. Firstly introduced in Goa scenes, its slower version comes back from time to time. I liked it.
B000000OQF|5.0|During the Senior class party back in 2005, we had a karaoke contest.  I won first place ($100) by singing Welcome to the Jungle, and my classmates created the \\"Axl Rose Pipes\\" Award just for me for my performance there.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums along with Stoned Immaculate, Bleach, Led Zeppelin III, Days of the New Red, and Pick of Destiny.  Amazingly well-done, the band shines.  It's no joke that Slash is my third favorite guitarist of all-time (after Randy Rhoads [2] and Jimmy Page [1]).  The music on hear is incredible.  Welcome to the Jungle has to have the best song intro ever created, and Paradise City has a mind-blowing outro solo.  Mr. Brownstone is arguably the greatest beat in Rock N' Roll history, and Anything Goes is a seriously underrated masterpiece.<br /><br />I have Welcome to the Jungle through Spaghetti Incident, but now all who remains of the original line-up is Axl Rose and GNR isn't so good anymore.  But they were amazing here.  I love every track, and the Use Your Illusion series were incredible follow-ups.  All-in-all, a great band for music.
B00005JPQR|5.0|A minor spoiler: they shouldn't have shown the man swimming away at the end (a crude attempt at leaving a path to next installment, maybe?). Would have been much more compelling ending because of uncertainty.    The mad cameraman returned in this third installment. He's stronger and more frantic than ever. Beware!  The amount of deadly, brutal, fast, violent action here is about the same as in the two previous films put together. Which means... a lot.    Pamela Landy stands between a ruthless horde of cryptic male chauvinists and Bourne, she is the mediator and a defender but her power lessened. Blocks verbal attacks and protests when assets are dispatched to kill. Stands as the semi-moral voice in the proverbial devil's den.    Bourne. The `Ultimate' Bourne gets busy indeed. There is more on his mind now then mere pursuit of his ancient history. He is after flesh, the meat of the matter, the man who masterminded the beginning of Treadstone. He must succeed or else. Woe to those who try to stop him.    Very nice scene at the end... However, I wanted him to go more after his family history, as well.
B00005JPD0|3.0|The premise of this movie is an interesting one. Denzel Washington is an ATF agent who while investigating a ferry explosion is recruited by a group of government funded techno nerds who have a device which can see backwards in time.  Somehow their mission mostly involves observing the leading actress in the shower and also walking around her apt in her underwear. Denzel is suddenly smitten and decides he has to go back in time to save not 300 victims in a ferry explosion but one woman he has seen in her underwear. This is Hollywood at its most insipid and this would have been a pretty decent movie if it wasn't for this adolescent spin.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Sure you are... ummm  Now, this film couldn't fail because so many things work for it. The cast... top notch. Surprise factor... check. Simply... it's not what you'd expect. Damon as an action [anti]hero?, techno-drama in technicolor, gritty european adventure, short to-the-point witty yet realistic dialogue. Fast, brutal violence. No BS. Franka Potente as an accidental girl-friend, her bright girly sarcasm balanced against Bourne's straight thinking. Haunting score, symphonic mixed with electronic, sometimes nostalgic the other times pumps you up with drum&bass.  From the perspective of bad guys (scenes in the agency shot through brownish warm filter look very nice) it's an example of `your sins are gonna hunt you down'.    Hard to say what influenced Doug Liman here but film noir for sure. The Matrix (during action sequences)? Maybe...    I'd take half a star away there for the `funny' ending. Not a bad ending at all... just felt a bit campy. Although, alternative ending doesn't fit too well either.
B000O75F7C|5.0|This album is absolutely brilliant.  The music is beautiful, the lyrics are great, and the concept is incredible.  Porcupine Tree is one of the greatest bands on earth right now.  Steve Wilson is an outstanding musician/vocalist/producer.  If you like good progressive rock music, this is for you.  Porcupine Tree continues to get better.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Great series. Storyline, dialogue, acting is terrific.   BUT  the DVD doesn't do the series justice. I'm not complaining about the video & sound qualities which are fine, but rather what is printed on the box and what is missing froim the DVDs.    The special features describe 2 features that aren't there: The Academy of Blood\\" and more irritatingly \\"Two audio commentaries by the Cast & Producers.\\" I enjoy learning about the creative process & how the actors interpret their roles. There is also a \\"much more\\" but I don't see it. Is this a sloppy oversight by the DVD producers or is there some secret passage to finding these features?    One of the more irritating features of the DVD is that it kicks off with a promo of the \\"Tudors.\\" Where is my check?
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie truly blew me away. Absolutely brilliant in every way. So much more than I expected. I was a little bit leery when I saw that it won an Academy Award as it seems that their judging criteria rarely take entertainment value into account. This movie entertains, shocks, and informs. I will definitely be buying it on blu-ray.<br />Some previous persons comment bashed Sony for only displaying a word a minute; this is a ridiculous statement. If I had to guess I would say that it was a hardware problem because he must have been watching it on a cheap dvd player since he obviously dislikes Sony. &lt; Meant to be humorous, not mean.
B000OVLNII|5.0|I loved this book.  Doris Kearns Goodwin is an excellent writer, she did 10 years of research before writing this book.  She makes you feel as if you are there.  You find out what a brilliant man Lincoln was and how he surrounded himself with men who were not always his strongest supporters. I did not want it to end.
B000NA2BEU|2.0|Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.<br /><br />There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.<br /><br />Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.<br /><br />Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.<br /><br />All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.<br /><br />The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.w, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.
075640407X|5.0|I couldn't put it down, I fell in love with the character right away. I've read a lot of books and this is one of my favorite! I can't wait for the second im super excited. This book is A MUST READ!!!<br /><br />Update: I wish this author would produce this series faster. I first reviewed and read this book in 2007 it's been nearly 9 years and we only have 2 novels and a novela. Honestly I wish he could finish the trilogy and then he can work on a different series, so we can have more content from him. He's a really good author, the story is well put together and crafted so you can't let go. It's haunting. So to give you a little umf to this review, how can you say no to adventure, magic, and mystery. Keep it coming.<br />:)
0807130087|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read (multiple times).  Once you get the flavor of the New Orleans dialogue, you will laugh through the entire book.  I'm just sorry they have not yet made a movie from it.  Ignatius is hysterical.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars ended before it's time.  Killed off by poor ratings and a Pussycat Dolls reality show, VM was one of the smartest and best shows on television during it's three year run.  Like most great shows with a short run, VM will likely only gain in stature as people begin to realize what they were missing.  Complex shows like this are best viewed in DVD format anyway, and it's must that you start at the beginning.      VM starts off in the aftermath of  three life changing events for it's title character, played to perfection by Kristen Bell.  Her best friend Lilly Kane was murdered, she was raped at a party, and her mother took off when her father investigated the popular, rich, and influential Kane family.  Keith lost his job as sheriff, and Veronica loses her boyfriend Duncan Kane and all her friends.  She enters her third year of high school as an outcast, working for her PI dad and taking cases from students for extra cash on the side.      There are three reasons why this DVD collection is a must own.    1.  The storyline.  VM is structured a lot like Buffy, with a mystery of the week and one over reaching storyline.  The mystery of the week stories are generally well done, with a couple that are kind of unbelievable and convoluted.  But the the major mystery of Lilly Kane's death makes this show a compulsive watch.  There are plenty of details and twists that keep your attention and add suspense.      2.  The writing.  VM is one of wittiest and funny shows i've seen in a while.  Veronica has a sharp tongue and all of her friends are also deadly clever, Logan Ecchols in particular.  You'll be quoting lines for a while.    3.  The performances.  Kristen Bell is spot on as Veronica.  Her character is very nuanced.  She manages to be tough, indepedent, loving, and fragile all at the same time.  It's no wonder why she's such a hot commodity now.  Enrico Colantoni is great as Keith Mars, Veronica's father, and former sheriff turned PI.  The loving relationshipbetween Veronica and Keith is one of the best parts of the show.  One of the most surprising characters is Logan, a son of a famous movie star who seems to be nothing but a anti-social jerk, but turns out to a much more complex and emotional character than he appears.  That's not even mentioning Percy Daggs and Francis Capra, both are great as Wallace and Weevil respectively.      But that being said, VM is not perfect.  There are plenty of moments that seem downright convienent and unbelievable.  The first thing that springs to mind is Wallace working in the attendance office.  Thank goodness for that, because without Wallace Veronica would not have access to countless permanent records.  I'm surprised she never got caught with one because she basically reads them out in the open.  Second is the flashback scenes.  During the flashback scenes Veronica dresses like a librarian, has long hair, and is basically a typical teenage girl.  But in a year she turns from ditzy blonde in to a female Phillip Marlowe.  It's a little unbelievable.      But honestly, those complaints really don't matter because the good points far outweigh the bad.  If your a fan of Buffy, or just good TV, pick this DVD set up.  It's addicting.  The next thing you know you'll have watched all of these episodes and you'll be fiending for season two.
0451196716|5.0|I have loved this book eversince I discovered it several years ago!  I continue to read it over and over.  I always thought that this would also be a GREAT MOVIE!  I would reccommend this book to anyone its a great book!
0142004235|5.0|I have never felt the need to review a book before, but I just finished reading East of Eden for the second time.  I read quickly, but this time I read slowly and savored every page.  As a long-time resident of Monterey County, I am touched by the poetic descriptions of places locals take for granted.  The Salinas River which runs underground in summer made a dry river bed into a lyrical image that I have never lost.  The beauty of the conversations between Samuel Hamilton and Lee, the sadness of the anecdotal stories that claim only a page or two, and the history of the area combine with the larger story seamlessly.  Steinbeck didn't just write -- he conjured full-blown images that stay with me long after I put the book down.
B000NA1XSA|5.0|My favorite Beatles related book to date.  Geoff Emerick and Howard Massey captured a straight forward account of The Beatles in the studio from beginning to end.  Added bonus includes Paul's sojourn in Lagos recording Band on the Run.  The interesting happenings their, were not in the studio.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Confusing, is it?  Not really.  It's a comic book, excuse me, \\"graphic novel\\" of the story of the 300 Spartans that fought their brains out long, long ago.  It's not Oscar worthy, but it's entertaining to the last.  No \\"real\\" actors and it still was a box office smash in 2007.  Testorsterone aplenty, this film has great action scenes and cartoony blood (to keep with the original look of the comic and to avoid a harsher MPAA rating), but is staged well...a bit too much slo-mo fighting but nothing too distracting.  Men, your women will enjoy this movie as much as you, at the very least from an eye candy standpoint (for the ladies' enjoyment, natch).  Testosterone fueled fighting and killing coupled with striking visuals and a carefully crafted transformation from page to screen makes for some great entertainment. I believe that was a run-on sentence.  Oh well.   :)       Don't sweat if you should buy the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD version (if you are like me and happen to be a High Def Junkie and own both formats), WB uses the same digital transfer for both types, so they are more or less identical in all high def areas.  I think the HD-DVD has more plentiful (or more interactive) special featueres, though.  Don't quote me on it, but either are a good choice if you have the means.
B000GH2YV0|4.0|What pleases me in Paulo Coelho's work, and in this book in particular, is his ability to penetrate the psyche of characters and make a story evolve from that,and not from detailed descriptions of actions or places.  If you compare him to, let's say, Emile Zola, where the characters from the gutters of society are usually vicious by nature (genes) or by the action of a decadent society, we will see in Maria, a prostitute, a being that suffers and dreams like anybody else, without this necessarily meaning that the author is condoning or condeming prostitution.  The painter she falls in love with, a successful artist who is \\"tired of sex\\", is as unhappy yet full of longing as she is. And Paulo Coelho builds a beautiful and complex plot of how their chemistry evolves - even if it may wind up a little naive sometimes, since, personally, I haven't seen two people change into enlightened lovers so fast.  But their innocence thriving in a cruel, loveless world, even despite their defenses, and their struggle to keep \\"real\\", is refreshing, and even edifying, even if not a fact of everyday reality.  I don't think this book will please those who are looking for a realistic portrait of the dirty and dark side of life at Copacabana (a bar in Switzerland) or in Rio de Janeiro.  But it will please those who believe literature isn't journalism, but rather an expression of an author's own subjective interpretation of love.  Paulo Coelho is, before anything else, a poet.  If you brake his text into verses, a poem comes out of it.  He is giving you a sad reality just to have it tested against the power of the mystic poetry of his discourse.  You will be able to let his personal poetry sink into you, if you manage to accept the author using prostitutes and \\"special clients\\" as ordinary people as his models - who, to him, are human beings capable of love and cynicism just like any one of us - not creatures of \\"low life\\".
B000RJO58M|5.0|\\"Official vocab guidelines state that\\" Hot Fuzz is a wonderul parody of action movies...and all with a British accent.  It's nice to see Timothy Dalton again, as well as Bill Nighy's turn as the Chief Inspector.  Some hilariously great lines and scenes, well worth the price of HD-DVD and then some.  Also, it's one of the best looking HD-DVD's I've seen overall.  Great PQ/AQ and loaded with features.
006097625X|3.0|Having read comics before, the book seemed almost as if it were talking down to me.  However, the section of the book that dealt with the structure of comics and their elements (i.e. Splash pages, the gutter, etc.) was a welcome education. It's a pretty quick read and if you're completely new to the comic/graphic novel genre, it's a good one to read.  But if you're a seasoned comic veteran, opt for one of Mccloud's other books instead.

B000000W5B|5.0|Everyone has their own opinion about what the most underrated Rolling Stones album is.  I really think Goats Head Soup fits that description perfectly.  Released in 1973, it contains two hit songs (\\"Angie\\" a GREAT ballad, and \\"Heartbreaker\\" memorable for the horn riffs).  But there are other really highly enjoyable songs on here as well.  In fact, the rest of the album is highly enjoyable.  The whole THING!      \\"100 Years Ago\\" is one of those songs that will NEVER leave your head once you listen to it.  It's a song designed to make the listener think about memories of their past (hopefully positive ones!).  \\"Coming Down Again\\" is very similar musically, except with a better vocal melody in my opinion.  \\"Silver Train\\" is a great rock song, \\"Hide Your Love\\" has a really good groovy beat, \\"Winter\\" is perhaps the bands most underrated ballad, \\"Can You Hear the Music\\" has a chorus section that positively brings me to tears, and \\"Star Star\\" is just a really... unusually pleasing pop song.  Excellent album all around.  Yes *this* is the bands most underrated record.
1579126227|4.0|The Mysterious Affair at Styles was the first novel to introduce the great Hercule Poirot to the world.  It also introduced Arthur Hastings, who appears in a number of other Poirot novels.  The story begins with Hastings arriving at Styles Court to visit an old friend and his family.  While he is at the estate, the Mistress of the house is killed.  By a lucky coincidence, Poirot is in the nearby village and free to investigate the matter.  The cast of suspects is largely drawn from the woman's family.  Poirot interviews them all in his unique style and his little grey cells are put to the test as he attempts to untangle the mystery as many twists and turns ensue.    Because this is the first Poirot novel, you might expect that it would be lacking compared to the later efforts.  It is often the case that characters become better developed in later stories, for example.  In this case, you will find a very typical Poirot novel, with no real evidence that Christie hadn't yet found his voice.  His little witticisms and eccentricities are present, the upper class suspects, the relatively remote \\"bottle\\" location for the murder... all of these are typical elements in a Hercule Poirot novel and all are well executed.  Once the story gets going, it moves along very well and the mystery certainly held my attention to the very end.  The suspects were all pretty interesting and Poirot himself is pure gold.  The only sour note for me was Hastings who is a bit too dense for my taste as well as being too pure of a Dr. Watson clone.      Overall, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well worth reading.  If it isn't the best Poirot story, it is still far from the worst.  While I might recommend a first time Christie reader to look elsewhere ([[ASIN:1579126898 Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)]], or [[ASIN:1579126286 Evil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery]]), this is definitely worth trying for those who have read several Poirot novels and arelooking for their latest fix of the little Belgian.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|I get tired of people putting down the Alan Parsons Project as being rip-offs of the Beatles.  Just because Alan Parsons has a talent for writing catchy and interesting music doesn't mean he's deliberately ripping off the Beatles.  Furthermore, I'm currently getting tired of all sorts of people using the intro to \\"Eye in the Sky\\" for commercials, football games, and other things.  Seriously, people are using that intro for *everything* these days.  It wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that the majority of music fans are quickly forgetting about the Alan Parsons Project existence, and a band with this much talent deserves to be remembered for their musical talents and NOT for a short intro to one of their hit songs.  It's wrong.  They have lots and lots of good music and this band deserves to be remembered for all their hard work through the years.
6303314015|5.0|The Lion King was a great movie. Well written, great animation and voice overs were done in a great manner. The whole concept of the story with the struggles and the good times should remind everyone that there are always hard times in life and that everyone can overcome them.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Some people have a problem with Eric Clapton's solo career because he has a habit of releasing lots of uninteresting laid back music.  Back Home has a really good song called \\"Revolution\\" that's groovy and influenced by reggae.  It's worth owning for this song alone.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Spartans, the greatest military minds of ancient greece and perhaps the greatest military force that ever existed, their swords where swift and their shields strong and anyone who stood in the way of their conquest fell in a pool of their own self assurance and derision.  This movie, besides its ovbious fictoral representation, portrays the spartan life style in good detail and engages the viewer in a world of fearless warriors who fealt pain as being the journey to the road that leads to glorious death in battle.  The battle of thermoplae is considered to be the single greatest military feat in history, a band of 300 spartans held off a persian army of 200,000 men in a 3 day long battle that will live on in the minds of war enthuists for years to come.  With the odds stacked at over 600 persians to every spartan, this would seem as a battle that should not have lasted longer than a minute, imagine fighting off 600 people for 3 days by yourself, this should give you an idea of just how extraudinary the spartan defence reallly was.  I love this movie because it captures the attitude i always imagined a spartan warrior would have, cocky, determined, and above all, a little crazy.  Weather you have an hd dvd player or a blue ray disc player, this will be one of the best looking high def movies out to date, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action epics, and beautiful environments, you won't be disappointed.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Dire Straits first album is a winner.  Right from the beginning these guys had something special going on, and they knew it.  They were really good at the whole \\"soothing rock with incredible guitar playing\\" style they distinctly had.  Nobody had a sound or style like these guys back in the late 70's, though many have tried to copy what Dire Straits were masters at.      Of course, if there's one negative with the band it's that most of their songs sound the same.  You either like the style or you don't.  If you like \\"Sultans of Swing\\" you will like the rest of the album.  That's almost a guarantee.  \\"In the Gallery\\" is very similar to that song in every way, and \\"Wild West End\\" is just a slightly softer track with light country influences.  If you like one song, you will like the entire album.
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini is one of the best tragedy writers i have ever read, the way he portrays Miriam's sense of remorse for the death of the mother she once loathed is a daunting look at human emotion.  Throughout the novel Hosseini gives his characters the ability to dream and hope for a brighter future, only to be halted by another obsticle that brings turmoil and chaos to their already troubled lifes.  It truly is like a roller coaster of emotion as every time it seems that things will turn out fine something comes along to get in the way, it is a story that can make many people relate and sympethize with the harsh realities of the protagonists lifes.  This book will truly shed light on the situation in Afghanastan and i'am eternally grateful to this writer for bringing me this precious insight into a previously unknown world. Mr Hosseini, i never though that you would be able to surpass the kite runner, which was one of my favorite novels of all time, but now i can only wait impatiently for the next masterpiece that exudes from the tip of your pen.
B000002ITW|4.0|I like this album, but I have a problem with the medley (consisting of three solo Neil Young tracks).  Each one of them has been shortened dramatically.  \\"The Loner\\" is now a short, acoustic slow song.  \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" is better, perhaps because I prefer a version of this song that doesn't rock (not a fan of the studio version at all).  It's better this way, believe me.  Now we can hear the song with solid singing to back it up instead of lazy guitar riffs.  However, this version of \\"Down by the River\\" may be the ultimate disappointment.  While the vocals are good, this song is supposed to be a lengthy electric guitar jam.  That's not what we get here, unfortunately.  I don't have a problem with the rest of the album, though.  It almost works as a greatest hits album when you think about it.
B00007GZR5|4.0|The cinematography and special effects are totally different than I had seen before.  How did they do that?  This movie keeps you guessing.  Robin crosses the boundary between life and death for the love of his life and finds a life and death struggle.  I believe you will either LOVE it or come away neutral towards it because of how different it is.
6300213498|5.0|The first half dozen times I watched this episode (as a kid) I took it as pro-Vietnam-war propaganda. Later I watched it and realized that it's a CRITIQUE of the Vietnam War. The ending is a little ambiguous, but I really believe that Kirk changes his mind about the rightness of a \\"Vietnamization\\" policy at the very last moment.<br /><br />There are things to quibble about -- such as the crappy California landscape used to portray \\"Eden\\" and the incredibly cheap wigs thrown on the planet denizens -- but a couple of things are outstanding. First, Kirk and McCoy argue over what is essentially a Federation \\"Vietnam\\" policy, made obvious by Kirk's reference to \\"twentieth-century brush wars in Asia.\\" The great thing about this scene is that both Kirk and McCoy give their side the best possible argument. McCoy retorts, \\"Yes, I remember. They went on for year after bloody year!\\"<br /><br />We are given reasons to mistrust Kirk. As McCoy points out, Kirk is under the influence of a local witch (Nancy Kovack) who is greedy, seductive, and selfish and trying to get him to provide her people with guns. But Kirk stands his ground. \\"Say you're right, that I am under her influence. What would YOU do, Doctor?\\" You see, the Klingons are arming one side in this fight and Kirk feels the need to back the anti-Klingon proxies. It's the hill people vs. the village people. It could've been the river people vs. the mountain people. Whatever. These primitive folks are just pawns in the Federation-Klingon Cold War.<br /><br />Another outstanding moment is Shatner's acting of that final line. It is a difficult scene -- the entire episode depends on it -- and Shatner delivers the episode's ambiguous, but ultimately anti-war statement. Flintlocks? \\"Serpents, Mr. Scott, serpents for the Garden of Eden. Just beam us up.\\" For all its flaws, this episode communicates a deeply heartfelt message that our Cold War involvements in the 20th century were depressing, tragic, and frought with moral perils. Peace was the way, but sometimes there were no easy answers. Maybe, despite the costs, it is better to just \\"beam up\\" and get out. None of this should be lost on people today as they think about how to get out of Iraq -- site of the original Garden of Eden.<br /><br />In watching this episode, remember that in 1967 the debate over the Vietnam War was just heating up and there were still many millions of people who insisted we needed to be there. This helps explain the ambiguous tone that Roddenberry gives the episode. But the fact that Kirk is seduced by the witch gives you a clue as to Roddenberry's real leanings.t sometimes there were no easy answers.

B00001PE4D|4.0|First-time director Roger Kumble concocts a wickedly attractive update of Dangerous Liaisons, this time set among rich and spoiled Manhattan teenagers. The screenplay is interesting, the settings are sumptuous and beautiful and the actors shine--with the exception of a sorely miscast Selma Blair, who looks like a thirty-year-old woman playing a five-year-old girl.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|\\"Dead Man Walking\\" is Sean Penn at his very best. He should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of convicted murderer, Matthew Poncelet. Susan Sarandon played Sister Prejean perfectly. This movie is sad, shocking, tragic and very informative. But, you don't have to be for or against the death penalty to find this picture riveting and thought-provoking.
B000QXDED6|4.0|No, I wasn't expecting \\"depth\\" to the characters nor was I expecting to see a documentary about the famous battle at Thermopylae--and perhaps that's why I can happily state that I was caught up in the frenzy and excitement and visual splendor of 300 from the opening scene to the touching ending.<br /><br />King Leonidas (brilliant performance by GERARD BUTLER), is the Spartan King who must send his brave warriors to fight the huge Persian army. Butler is certainly not one-dimensional in the role, which is what would have happened in the hands of a less talented actor. He found many facets that humanize this ferocious King with an appetite for battle and he makes the most of his every moment on screen. Snyder certainly lucked out in finding exactly the right man for the role. In many close-ups he reminds me of the classic screen star ROBERT TAYLOR (think \\"Ivanhoe\\").<br /><br />And others around him are fine too. LEONA HEADEY makes an interesting, spirited Spartan Queen, with a beautiful face and a lovely commanding presence of her own. She's especially good in her scenes with the conniving DOMINIC WEST, as the two argue over sending a larger army against the Persian hordes. Their final confrontation is a shocker.<br /><br />Visually, the film is an artistic achievement that makes stunning use of the CGI and blending it with the studio shots in a way that resembles murals and famous works of art. This is one aspect of the film that is easily guaranteed to earn Oscar nominations in technical categories.<br /><br />Butler's command of the screen is more evident here than in any other film to date. No doubt this will be an iconic role for him.<br /><br />Only drawback is the sound mix of music and dialog which could have been mixed to the point where the spoken words are not drowned out by the relentless (but fascinating) background score, which tends to milk every melodramatic moment to the max.<br /><br />The battle scenes are well staged and I never found the use of slow motion distracting or inappropriate. Snyder has done a fantastic job.has done a fantastic job.
B000O178BY|2.0|NIN has been a staple in my music library since the release of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\".  His music, beats and lyrics are phenomenal, usually.      I have found 3 songs that I can stand to listen to in this album.  Most tracks appear to be poorly mixed or have very annoying samples played over them.    \\"Year Zero\\" seems more like a first album than an 8th album.  His music definitely took a step backwards in this case.

B000OCXFCO|1.0|I love Megadeth, I consider them...Dave... my favorite band but this record is sad. It is technical...but emotionless, the songwriting is poor and the solos from Mr. Drover make me physically ill. There is not one good track on this record. In order to be successful a band should continue to evolve , not try to rehash what made them famous - then you become a caricature of yourself. The last record, TSHF, was great. There were some other records that could definitely be considered flops and I cannot in any consciousness figure out how a \\"fan\\" could be satisfied with United Abominations.    Don't buy this record, go buy the Killing is My Buisiness Remaster.  -Megadeth Fan
B000QQFKYE|1.0|This is up there as one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. The only reason I finished this rubish was I figured it had to go somewhere, hell he had three hours! If you want to make a movie about the evils of Hollywood then do it, don't make some rubbish that feels like your viewing it through the eyes of an 8 year old with A.D.D. who forgot to take his meds. Trust me, this movie couldn't get any worse. My only explination for these 5 star reviews is I think people are trying to look all arty and smart when in reality its just a mess. They should include a third disc with this DVD, one where he applogises for making this movie and more so for your having watched it.

0807126063|1.0|Without trying to offend any of the fans, who seem numerous, I was spectacularly disappointed with this book.  I bought this book on a whim, before a week off, because I thought the Pulitzer Prize denoted quality, and I had heard the book was good.  I thought the writing was of poor quality, although there were a few very clever metaphors (boiling hotdogs as paramecia was my favorite).  The plot was thin at best, the characters totally unbelievable and poorly developed, and the humor, if you could call it that, was geared towards the lowest common denominator, a la Carl Hiassen, although Carl has actually made me laugh.  No offense to Carl -- he knows what his target audience is and I'm guessing, even as a former newspaperman, he does not feel miffed to have been passed over by the Pulitzer gods with respect to his \\"trashy novels\\".  I guess there must be a distinction between humor and wit or something, as the media reviews were glowing and consistent in their recommendation.  I only finished it because I was hoping beyond hope that at some point it would get good; it did not.  Even the ending was poorly constructed.      The setting of New Orleans, one of my favorite towns, was wasted, too.    I happened upon some Thurber, and even some Dave Barry books in our vacation house, and I laughed out loud, so before you label me elitist or a stick in the mud, I do enjoy a funny tale. Confederacy is simply not one of them.  I left the book in the vacation house to torture some other soul.  You could not pay me to read this piece of junk again.  In contrast, I reread Bryson's \\"A Short history of Nearly Everything\\" each year and enjoy it each time.
B000TSIK14|5.0|This may well be the best Scorpions CD in a long, long time, going back as far as Love at First Sting or Blackout, I just hope that this is not their last one. Because after all of these years this band still knows how to rock. And I have been a fan from way back, as in the Tokyo Tapes era. There is not a single bad song on the album, no fillers, just one very solid effort. Only bad thing about it, if it is a bad thing, is that it is not much of a concept album if that is what you are looking for, but who cares when this CD rips like it does. Favorite songs are as follows:    We Will Rise Again   321  Love Is War     If you are a Scorpions fan, buy this CD you definitely won't be disappointed.

B00005JLCI|4.0|I was disappointed that there is no booklet included in the 2-Disc special edition DVD. I was hoping, given that this production uses the complete dialog of the play, for a reference that would link acts and scenes to discs and chapter numbers. But nothing... not even the half-sheet \\"poster\\" insert that many budget titles include.    Is that really worth a \\"star?\\" Of course not. The production is surely worth the 5 stars that most people are giving it. I have not had time to sit down and watch it in its entirety yet, but a few quick peeks suggest that a good job was done with the DVD transfer as well (viewed upconverted to 1080i).
1594489505|5.0|One of the best if not THE best book I've ever read.  I was a HUGE fan of the Kite Runner so I was very much anticipating the release of this novel and boy was it worth the wait.  Hosseini's words just flow like waves on the page...it's so beautiful to read and even more amazing to experience.  The character development in this book is unmatched - you know the characters so well that with every riviting change in their lives you feel their emotions too.  So powerful and eye-opening that it's left me wanting to learn much more.  Incredible story - loved every page.  When's the next one??? :)

0143038419|2.0|I resisted reading this book until a trusted friend recommended it to me.  I agree that the writing is clean, descriptive, readable, and at times witty and at other times sorrowful.  However, I believe she is looking for love (and for God)in all the wrong places.    I've read the Seven Storey Mountain by Thomas Merton [[ASIN:0156010860 The Seven Storey Mountain]]and the Spiral Staircase by Karen Armstrong[[ASIN:0385721277 The Spiral Staircase: My Climb Out of Darkness]].  Now those are spiritual journeys!  Many of the reviewers have commented on the self-centeredness of the author and I must second those observations.  Somehow having an affair with a handsome Brazilian in Bali just doesn't seem to be the ultimate goal of a spiritual journey -- probably fun, probably could take one's mind off the troubles in the past, but somehow after all the focus of communicating with some kind of higher power in India, it seems a bit anti-climatic.    This is kind of fun to read and there are a few parts that might provide food for thought, but I can't imagine that this would have any kind of lasting affect on anyone's life.
0321200683|5.0|Upon recently changing jobs and focusing on messaging design and architecture, I was steered toward this book by my peers. Without getting into too much detail, before joining my new team, I had never heard of patterns (came from a product support area), much less asynchronous messaging design. Needless to say, this book has been invaluable in my learning process as well as conveying our direction to others.    This book is written in such a way that it is very intuitive. Diagrams help support the concepts and code examples as well.    I would highly recommend this as a must read/reference guide for anyone designing messaging solutions.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|After how many years am I still listening to this cd?!!  I have bought a few of Philip Glass' cds but this is my all time favorite.  I listen to this over and over, when I'm happy, when I'm contemplative, whenever.  I adore this music so much I have copies of it everywhere.  Back in 2002, when it was first released, I played it every morning to my roommates' perplexity.  They always seemed concerned that I would get depressed by this music.  I would urge them to listen more carefully, for the music is tender, passionate, and voices its theme of the preciousness of life in the repetitive and loving way only achieved by masterpieces.  I hope I never tire of this score as it brings me great peace.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|When I began watching this film, I had a sense early on that I might not like it all that much as I thought the character of Gwen and her drunken antics were somewhat overdone, until the scene where she crashes the limo. Such incidents do happen with addicts in denial and unaware of their dangerous behavior while under the influence. As the movie continued, I was impressed with how this film showed a realistic portrait of the events and situations that take place in a rehab facility. There is good humor throughout the film as humor is a needed assett when struggling through difficult times, but there is also debatable explanations on the meaning of life and why people make the choices they do as the scene with Gwen and her boyfriend gives an exchange of two very different outlooks on life. Gwen also comes to take accountability as she discovers the owning up process. The scenes involving her and her sister are touching and believable rather than coming off as forced or sappy, and the supporting characters grow on you despite their issues. Filled with superb writing that lends itself to many moments of laughter, sadness, and positive affrimations that are true to life(\\"Something bigger than us will care and determine our outcomes when we take care of the little things\\")28 Days is one of the best movies to come around in a long time.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Magan grows up a pious, obedient, good daughter of a middle class Islamic family. As a small child she suffers female circumcision. By the time she is a teenager she has lived as refugee in three countries besides her native Somalia, and learned five languages. Most of her school years she spends in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. Most of her life she does her best to obey the dictates of Islam and of her family and culture. The tear comes when her father marries her off to a Canadian Somali she has never met, and whom even her father barely knows.     She finds refuge in the Netherlands, where she sets herself about to learn the language and get an education. She leaves Islam and becomes an Atheist as she studies the great works of the past. Eventually it is reason, not her experience, that tells her the teachings of religion are false and vain.  An excellent autobiography of a very courageous, bright, and beautiful woman.

1594489505|3.0|I tried to take A Thousand Splendid Suns on it's own merits and not let the shadow cast over it by Hosseini's first magnificent book the Kite Runner . I greatly anticipated this his second book, I feel now somewhat disappointed . While this book tells a well packaged story and Hosseini continues to reveal writing talent I had to force myself to read the last 50 pages after having put it down for over a week having felt betrayed by the almost Danielle Steelesque working out between the long lost lovers. I did not see this coming and I did not feel it fit well with the story he was telling. It felt so contrived in the end and I felt such resentment I nearly determined not to read the last 50 pages at, but thought I owned it myself since I had spent much time reading the first three qtrs of the book.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I love horror movies and I love gore but for some reason this movie just doesn't do it for me.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|won't want to get rid of.  First off to be honest...it doesnt matter to me what type of music Panic! is labelled as.  It matters if you enjoy the music and have fun while listening.  I happen to enjoy them plain and simple, none of the they are trying to be \\"punk\\" or whatever that's just lame.  If you dont feel their music that's cool but posting negative reviews when you havent even listened to them is bullcrap or the they are just a Fall Out Boy clone...whatever.  I don't see them out there doing your thing in front of people (many critics)...please stop hating.<br /><br />Now about the review of this cd.  I find myself enjoying the cd for many reasons.  The songs are catchy and enjoyable to listen to and the overall feel of the cd is varied from a party type vibe on some tracks to a serious more subdued vibe on other tracks.  Everything in between there isn't even a track on the cd that i didnt find myself humming or tapping my feet too all the while just generally having a good time enjoying all that's happening.<br /><br />Some songs of note on \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" include:<br /><br />\\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\"<br />\\"But It's Better If You Do\\"<br />\\"Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have, Without Taking Off Her Clothes (* one of my favs)<br />\\"Time To Dance\\"<br />\\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\\"<br />\\"There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey..\\"<br />\\"Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks\\"<br /><br />I also think it's pretty cool how they title the different songs each having some different meaning.  All the while having a sense of humor and rhyme to them as well.  Easily one of the better cds that i picked up and is only the beginning for a band that knows how to go out there and have fun while making music.  That's what i enjoy most about PATD looking forward to the next CD by them.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Its totaly pointless talking about which albums are \\"better\\" than others. Taste is subjective, and there is no scorecard for art, so just can it.     That being said, Jesus, no other album has hit me emotionally the way Pet Sounds does. Lyrically, musically, just... everything. Its one of those things that if you have to EXPLAIN to someone why its so great, they're missing the point all together. This album just has to hit you. If it doesn't, well, all the good reviews and top albums of all time lists in the world can't fix that.     It hit me. Boy did it hit me hard (I just recently discovered this album). Its just something you listen to, and then go \\"Oh Jesus, this is so much better than anything I've ever heard before\\" You get excited at your new discovery, and then you get that sinking feeling, knowing that everything you thought was good before is going to sound awful now in comparison. It creates a new world of music, and destroys your old one all at the same time. Yes, its THAT good (Radiohead's OK Computer was the only other album to ever do this for me).     And hey, if you have to ask \\"Why?\\", well dude, just don't even bother. It can't be explained, it just has to be felt. This kind of music just isn't for everyone.     But it is for me.
B0000028WD|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various music supplies and recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />October 16th, 1992 New York City's Madison Square Garden is sold out for a tribute To Bob.  Dylan that is.  The 30th Anniversary Concert would bring together not only Dylan's long time friends but those that were touched by his music.  The evening was a true celebration and for several hours as the famed concert hall rocked, all seemed right with the world.<br /><br />Fast forward to the release date of August 24, 1993 and the album capturing the festivities of October 16th of the previous year is ready for sale.  There are two glaring omissions that startled many consumers.  George Harrison's rendition of \\"If Not For You\\" is left in the vaults as is Eric Clapton's \\"Love Minus Zero, No Limit.\\"  You can't rationalize this.  The rest of the selections have enough sterling moments to make a purchase worthwhile.  John Mellencamp didn't take the safe road when he performed \\"Leopard-Skin Pill Box Hat.\\"  Equipped with a Dylan vocal inflection and some in your face rock and roll , this was a superlative version.  Johnny Cash commands a lot of respect but here he pays homage to Dylan with a country interpretation of \\"It Ain't Me, Babe.\\"  Johnny Winter did a blowtorch version of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" in the 1970's and the passion and desire hasn't left his six string.  Neil Young brought tears to many with \\"Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues.\\"  The sincerity coming from Neil's soul was evident from the opening note.  Many an accolade followed Eric Clapton's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.\\" George Harrison was slighted without the stellar \\"If Not For You\\" being included on the 2 CD set however he couldn't be denied on \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie.\\"  Tom Petty supplied enough wattage on \\"Rainy Day Woman #12 And 35 to light up the arena.  \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" always seems so right when Roger McGuinn is on the recording.  Once again he delivers a wonderful tribute to Dylan.  Not only did Roger but all those that showed to every generation Dylan's vision lives on.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"oger McGuinn is on the recording.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|The last season of Gilmore Girls may not be the best of the series, but it by far surpasses most other television shows currently on the air.  The witty banter is still just as break-neckingly amusing, and the chemistry between Lorelai and Luke is still just as amazingly palapable. Rory is still just as smart, cute and funny. Kirk is still way out there crazy. Sookie is still cranking out babies and cooking great food in her hilarious manner. Paris is still a neurotic over achiever. The elder Gilmores are still charming and controlling, and Christopher still can't be counted upon when he is needed. The fact that the fringe characters and the town of Stars Hollow itself are so important to the series is part of what makes this such a memorable and wonderful show. I can't think of another series that just makes one smile as much as our beloved Gilmore Girls.

His songs definetly have that glam rock vibe, but they have a unique transcendent, tongue in cheekiness all their own.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|For those of you who are fans of BRMC's first two albums and can only buy albums from BRMC if they sound just like the first two, then don't buy this, it's not what you are looking for. If, however, you are looking for one of the better gospel/blues albums of our generation then buy this right now....don't hesitate.    What BRMC did is much like what the Rolling Stones did when they started recording \\"Exile on Main Street\\", they took everything they had been doing and made it more raw. Turn off the pedals boys, it's time to get sticky. The deep growl of guitars is replaced by acoustic strumming and some excellent slide work, particularly on \\"Ain't No Easy Way.\\" To fill in the gaps that the normally would be filled by some sort of electronic feedback they went to a tried and true method, black female gospel singers.     My personal favorite track on this album though would have to be \\"Fault Line.\\" The ambient nature of the guitar and vocals together provide an excellent environment for the contrasting sound of a Tom Petty-esque harmonica solo, which apparently the boys noticed. The production of this album was very well done, and if you look carefully in the liner notes you'll see T-Bone Burnett had something to do with that.    An excellent album for one trying to find a modern day simplistic blues gospel sound. Well done boys, well done.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is one of those shows that turn a really bad day into a pretty good one. The cast is superb, the scenery is amazingly beautiful, and the writing is top notch. I have always personaly thought of GG as more like a book than a television series. It manages to suck you in and place you right in Stars Hollow instead of treating you as a passive viewer. Like a pair of warm socks, Gilmore Girls will make you feel cozy and happy to be exactly where you are.
B000N6TX22|5.0|Two things can be said about this product:<br />a) This is a great film.<br />b) This is a great HD DVD edition.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: The world is in chaos in 2027. Mankind decays slowly and faces its extinction as infertility has been the rule for over 18 years. Theo (Clive Owen), a disillusioned man, must escort through a sea of unimaginable adversities the most precious person: a pregnant woman.<br /><br />THE FILM is great at many levels. First, I'd say it is because of a great cast. Clive Owen is the perfect \\"zombie\\", a man who just lets himself go on with nothing to look forward to. His performance is unforgettable as a passive anti-hero who'll go all the way in order to accomplish his mission. Julianne Moore is also perfect as she gives a very quiet and underplayed performance as an activist hunted by the police (with whom Theo was once in love). Michael Caine shines (as usual) as an old hippie who now lives in the woods - in fact, his performance made me go back many times because it is so rich and physical... I really had to see it again several times at certain scenes.<br /><br />The Production Design is a landmark.<br />Rarely we have seen such a puzzling look at the future. It is not Blade Runner. It is not Star Trek. It is not I, Robot. It is simply (if I try to define it) a version of the future which is incomplete... as (like i said before) mankind is slowly disappearing, the future becomes stagnant and reduced to minimum signs of utopia and evident signs of dystopia.<br /><br />The direction is precise and creative.<br />The director really succeeds in giving us his full vision of the story, in scenes that are absolutely great. Using excruciatingly long takes, he really succeeds in giving us the true feel and the emotion behind the story. The car sequence is unbelievable. The old building shootout scene is unbelievable - just to chose two.<br /><br />The cinematography & camera work are perfect.<br />From the composition of the shots to the light in each shot/scene... the camera movements, the focus... everything here is right. I loved the blood drops on the lenses. you really don't see things like that every day...<br /><br />The screenplay is near perfect.<br />Well paced and well developed. It makes all journeys though \\"urban chaos\\" look like Disneyland. Characters and situations are very well written. I really felt the screenplay went where the story needed to go.<br /><br />Special effects are perfect.<br />THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!!!!!<br /><br />This HD DVD edition is a combo disc meaning that the disc comes with two sides: side A is a HD DVD side. Side B is a regular DVD side you can play everywhere.<br /><br />Isn't it great?<br /><br />The extras are great:<br />- Picture in Picture interviews with the director, crew and cast. (an exclusive HD DVD format feature not possible in the Blu-ray format).<br />- U control feature: exploring the imagery (another HD DVD exclusive feature that takes advantage of HDi).<br />- Info & Commercials: expanded from what we saw in the movie while we watch the movie. VERY DISTURBING! (another HD DVD exclusive feature).<br />- The Possibility of Hope: a documentary exploring the themes you'll find in the film.<br />- Under Attack: a short piece showing us how they made two very hard scenes (yes, the car sequence is there!).<br />- Deleted scenes (the one in the Art Ministry is my favorite).<br />- Theo & Julian: a short piece detailing the characters/actors relationship.<br />- Futuristic Design: a short piece on the stunning visual aspects of the film (a must see!).<br />- Commentary.<br /><br />This is one those titles that really show you how great HD DVD is.<br />HD DVD is truly a great format.

0151013047|3.0|I suspect there will be two different categories of readers attracted to this book:  those who have heard it is a good thriller and those who have heard it is a novel of literary merit...those approaching it as a thriller will be more satisfied, but it does not quite make it in either category, at least for me.    \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" tells the story of a Pakistani named Changez as he narrates his life story to an American in a cafe in Lahore, post 9-11.  There were some aspects of the novel that I liked... Changez, has a firm and consistent tone throughout, and his love interest, Erica, is believable, at least at first.  While the prose is well-crafted (Changez adopts a somewhat archaic and formal tone to the American stranger) the claims for the beauty of the language in other reviews seem somewhat overblown.   There are some tricks played with the reader, based mainly on our assumptions about the characters, but I did not find this very clever.  It heightens the suspense, but rather in the fashion of a movie where the fright device suddenly jumps out at the viewer.  But in a purportedly realistic novel, one likes to have the details right or credibility suffers.  The business setting, Changez's job as a \\"valuation analyist\\" at an American hot-shot \\"valuation firm,\\" just did not seem credible to me...such jobs, mainly done by investment banks or consultants, would not be assigned to a 22-year-old fresh out of undergrad Princeton.  Although the author has reportedly worked as a financial consultant in New York, the work setting did not convince. Changez's  firm would not send a team of 5 or 6 to Manila for three months to \\"value\\" a local CD manufacturer...I mean, what were they doing, counting the paperclips?  We are also told that it is up to Changez to devise his own \\"valuation model,\\" a strangely ad hoc and imprecise approach melded to the unbelievably precise.  Perhaps the author is trying to make some sort of point about Changez's character, in thathe has aspects of the precise and vague in his personality, but if so, it didn't work for me and just detracted from credibility, important in a thriller.  Without giving away any essential plot developments, Changez's later \\"change\\" I found rather forced and inexplicable.  A-type personalities who get into Princeton just don't act this way, and that also detracted from his girlfriend Ericka's believability, who similarly went to Princeton. Changez seems always to be graded and judged, at Princeton, and at the firm, yet there seems little questioning of the validity of this system.  Is he just a grade-grubbing bourgeois striving to climb into the upper ranks of the plutocracy or does he see this more cynically?  The tension does build as the narration proceeds, but there are continual nagging questions about credibility that slowly add up throughout but thr reader is always aware of authorial manipulation throughout.  There is little discussion of issues of religion, class or race and that too detracted from the credibility of the novel's resolution.  But the author deserves credit for his handling of this theme, identity problems of a Pakistani in post 9-11 America, but I wish he had set it in a background with which he may have had more familiarity.   Right now, this is long-listed for the Booker Prize.  Of others on the list, I have read only Ian McEwan's \\"On Chesil Beach\\" a stronger novel, at least in terms of the prose, but it is not McEwan at his best.  I also read several Booker-eligible novels that never made the list but should have(particularly John Burnside's \\"The Devil's Footprints\\")... there are stronger candidates on the Booker list than \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" and the list itself seems very weak this year.  But if one is after a decent short thriller to occupy oneself for a few hours, this may serve the purpose.
0374105235|5.0|Sadly, this is a memoir that would never work as fiction.  No one would believe the story of a twelve year old who loses his parents, becomes a violent, effective, drug-using soldier and then becomes rehabilitated.    Mr. Beah tells his memoir in a style so straight-forward and sparse that his voice adds to the credibility of his story.  It has a built-in realism that borders on the shell-shocked and propels the reader through page after page of litanies of war horrors.    There is also a self-knowledge by the author rare in a man of his tender years.  Perhaps because he has gone through three or four different lives already (he begins the narrative while in high school) he has gained insight beyond his years.    During the rehabilitation process the counselors and UN types keep telling the boy soldiers: \\"It is not your fault\\".  The reader gets the idea that although Mr. Beah believes this in his head, he is still having a hard time believing it in his heart.  There seems to be a lurking guilt and horror behind his words, even after going through what he and the authorities call his rehabilitation.  This may be why the reader is compelled to root for the youth even as he is performing such very barbaric acts of warfare.    This is a terrific book on several levels:  modern day warfare using children, the affairs of Sierra Leone, a boy's struggles, loss of youth and innocence, warfare in today's third world countries where all the fighting is on the ground, and the author's candid introspection.  It is the kind of book that could keep a reading club discussion going into the wee hours.  It is also the kind of book that will stay with the reader, in a haunting way, for a very long time.
0761536434|4.0|This is a pacy and enjoyable book that takes the reader on a journey from the earliest days of the games industry to the arrival of the Xbox (around 2001). It's mostly written from a business perspective and you get a good sense of the wheeling and dealing that went on behind the scenes. References are made to certain games but really if that's what you're after then you'd be far better of with The Video Games Guide. The writer clearly conducted a lot of interviews to help enliven the history and although he devotes an inordinate number of pages to Nolan Bushnell and Atari some of the anecdotes are priceless (love to hear about the execs who passed on Pole Position).
B000L1CUI8|5.0|I have this album, yet no longer have a record player.  I also have it on Cd and listen to it often.  For me, the beautiful cover on this LP can never be appreciated on a tiny CD cover.  Even though it is the same picture, there is something about the size of the album cover that brings out details missed  on a smaller version.  In the 70's  I spent many a lonely day playing her album, dissecting the picture.  Carole King spoke to me through her songwriting and this picture.  I had the same frizzy 70's hair, the unruly 70's look and her eyes held my emotions a teenage girl goes through everyday.  It represented, hope for my depression, pleasure  when I was happy and peace and solitude when I needed it.  The music is awesome, but this cover touches my heart and is a big part of my past.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|I write this review from the perspective of someone who went to Europe with 60 other teens in 1984 and remember all the teen sex comedies of the 1980s. While my experience in Europe didn't quite end up like the experiences in this movie, I felt uniquely and oddly suited to this film.<br /><br />This film was made by my contemporaries and was inspired by those sex comedies where the main character travels with his friends to get sex and is confronted with broadly drawn sterotypes that get in the way of his having sex along the way.<br /><br />There are very few comedies that make me laugh upon multiple viewing. When our guests are in the mood for a comedy we pull this out and reliably people are laughing out loud. Whether it is the mime bit, discovering the red light district with Lucy Lawless, or a hilarious cameo by Matt Damon -- it is funny each time I see it.<br /><br />Yes. There are shameless, shameless, shameless stereotypes of Europeans. My European friends just need to get a sense of humor and realize that it doesn't come from a pejorative or mean place. There is shameless nudity (both female and male), but I really don't see this as much of a problem, unless you yourself have a problem with it. It is primarily nudity for humor rather than anything else.<br /><br />This is not high cinema, just a high-energy, silly, fun, and funny film with likeable characters and an excellent soundtrack including a french version of the Who's \\"My Generation.\\"<br /><br />For days after, I found myself singing, \\"Fiona and me...\\"<br /><br />You might too.
072325804X|5.0|You know I saw that movie Ms. Potter and learned all about Peter Rabbit and the other characters. I was so enchanted with the movie that I had to buy the book.  It was very lovely to see them all bound in one beautiful book with a lovely book sleeve--- Very NICE!!  This would make a wonderful gift for a new baby or a special Easter gift.
1594489505|5.0|I read this book for a book club I belong to.  I found it to be a quick read and a book I looked forward to picking up and reading whenver time was available.  I found it interesting reading about how the daily lives of the people were so controled by the different governments in control.  It gave me more insight of the plight of women in such countries, but also the controls on many of the men's activities.  My book club seemed to like it as well and it generated some good discussion.
B00003CXAY|4.0|these movies, albeit a bit dated, and i wish they were in HD... give a wonderful view of modern life, falling apart, and racing by.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I had seen this movie in the theatres and loved it then.  This summer while teaching a group of Extrememly At-Risk adolescent male students we did a unit on Oceania -- New Zealand, New Guinea and Fiji.  I wasn't sure these \\"tough guys\\" were going to by into a movie with a female protaginast but was I ever Wrong!!  They loved it.  It will now become a staple of my curicculum  in film studies, world cultures, literature and gender equity!
1591841666|5.0|A very brief but thought provoking book by Seth Godin. 'Winner's never quit' is an everyday maxim, but it is not necessarily true. You should quit if it won't get you anywhere: the cul-de-sac. Likewise, you shouldn't quit if the short term pain will be offset by the large long term benefits. Of course, the hard part is in the trying to identify which scenario you're in, and this book might help you do exactly that. Highly recommended.
B0000640VO|5.0|I have found this film -- a film that I can watch multiple times and I frequently come up with excuses to put this DVD in to be transported into Amelie's world. The film begins introducing Amelie as an inventive little girl, whose isolation is due to a simple misunderstanding by her parents. Her doctor father thinks she has a heart condition because her little heart beats faster during the only time she has physical contact with him through his stethoscope.<br /><br />Amelie's world has intense colors and the beautiful sights of Paris where she enjoys simple pleasures.<br /><br />She dips her hands into a bag of beans for the guilty tactile pleasure of it.<br /><br />The sound of cracking the crust of her brulee delights her.<br /><br />She wants to be loved, but is shy and retreats into her own little world.<br /><br />A random event propels her to find and help a stranger, which leads her to become somewhat of a superhero of kindness to those in need and impish retribution to the mean. This is cleverly woven with a series of urban myths reenacted as in the traveling gnome. Her journey takes her from helping strangers, neighbors, co-workers, friends, family, and ultimately herself. Her actions in a way set free those she helps whether it is allowing them to get out and travel, feel better against a verbal insults, have some closure in the face of lost love, or find your soulmate.<br /><br />Yes. Audrey Tautou is an adorable actress and is a perfect fit for the character of Amelie. Yet, I have seen her in other films being equally charming, but the films fall flat for me. What makes this film is the collection of quirky characters, the amazing cinematography, the clever writing, and the attention to details.<br /><br />I often recommend this film as a great date movie because it does turn into a charming, quirky, funny, ultimately romantic experience for Amelie without being too sweet or too sappy. There a things for both men and women to appreciate.

B000QQH4YS|4.0|On the cusp of HD, RoboCop gets re-released as a 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD that portends quick obsolescence but you shouldn't let that dissuade you from purchasing this standard def DVD to tide you over until the HD format war has ended. However, it appears that there is a \\"glitch\\" more severe than a malfunctioning ED-209 present on Canadian versions of disc 2 with a duplication of disc 1 onto disc 2 and the first copy I purchased here in the US had an authoring glitch that would not allow me to select the DTS or alternate audio tracks on Disc 2.  I can already hear the Old Man yelling \\"You call this a glitch!?\\"  If you own the legendary Criterion release featuring the \\"Extended Cut\\" you will be pleased to know that the upgrade is well worth getting, though you will probably want to hold on to your original Criterion disc for some of the extras that didn't make the migration over to the new 20th Anniversary disc.<br /><br />Disc 1 features the original theatrical cut in anamorphic 1:85:1 widescreen (The Criterion release was presented in 1:66:1 which is Paul Verhoeven's \\"preferred\\" aspect ratio) and Dolby 5.1 and DTS sound but the real treat on this disc is the excellent documentary \\"Flesh & Steel: The Making of RoboCop\\" featuring interviews with Paul Verhoeven, Jon Davison, Ed Neumeier, Basil Poledouris, and Peter Weller. There's also a couple of 8-minute 1987 featurettes: \\"Shooting RoboCop\\" featuring Miguel Ferrer in character as Bob Morton introducing RoboCop like an OCP publicity gimmick and \\"Making RoboCop\\" with a behind-the-scenes look at the production and interviews from back in the day. \\"The Boardroom\\" is a storyboard-to-film comparison of ED-209 accompanied with Phil Tippet commentary, 4 deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer with music from, appropriately enough, \\"The Terminator,\\" another cyborg sci-fi smash from Orion Pictures.<br /><br />Disc 2 features the \\"Extended Cut\\" in anamorphic widescreen 1:85:1 and Dolby 5.1 and DTS sound which is a phenomenal enhancement over the old Dolby surround mix on the Criterion release and restores :23 seconds of graphically violent shots of ED-209 gunning Mr. Kinny into hamburger in the OCP executive board room, Murphy's hand getting blown-off and his stump spurting blood, and Clarence Boddicker's jugular squirting blood after Robo stabs him in the throat which were edited from the theatrical version to garner an R-rating and have been seamlessly restored back into the film.  Why they couldn't just make this a seamless-branching feature on the same disc as the theatrical version like the Commando Director's Cut DVD and put all of the bonus features on the second disc is puzzling though. Disc 2 also features another outstanding featurette: \\"Villains of Old Detroit\\" with new interviews with Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer, and Ray Wise and is a terrific follow up after watching the film. \\"Special Effects: Then and Now\\" talks about the advances in digital compositing versus the in-camera matte shots and stop-motion animation employed on creating ED-209. \\"RoboCop: Creating a Legend\\" features interviews with Peter Weller, Paul Verhoeven, Rob Botin, et al. about designing and engineering the suit and took between 10-11 hours each day to fit Peter Weller into before shooting.<br /><br />As Murphy's Law would have it, ironically, I ended up having to return my first copy to the store I purchased it from because I was not able to select the DTS track on disc 2.  The department manager and I tested this on different players and on another copy and confirmed the problem.  Since originally writing this review I have recently obtained another copy from a different retailer and it did not have any of the problems selecting the audio tracks so I must have got one from a bad batch and hopefully it is fairly isolated.  This is also going to be released on Blu-Ray but too bad it won't be a combo disc.

006074815X|5.0|Ken Follett is among the best at writing thrillers that hook you and never let you go.<br /><br />In interviews, he acknowledged that \\"Eye of the Needle\\" was his breakthrough novel. It surely deserves all the praise it has received.<br /><br />In 1940, the The Abwehr, (German Intelligence), has planted their finest agent in Great Britain---code name \\"The Needle.\\" Using the name Henry Faber, he works as a railway clerk and attempts to be invisible.<br /><br />Using his bicycle for transportation, he observes all the war preparations and anything that would be helpful for the German bombers.<br /><br />As the war progresses, Faber continues his adroit undercover work---radioing the info back to The Fatherland.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Allies are utilizing a disinformation campaign designed to convince the Germans that the European Invasion (D-Day) will take place at Pas de Calais. Ships and tanks that are merely rubber and timber, barracks that were a movie set, etc. were utilized to persuade the enemy that Patton had a huge Army ready to invade.<br /><br />Double agents that MI5 had turned churned out radio reports furthering the deception.<br /><br />If the Germans learn of the great ruse, thousands could be lost. The Needle chances upon the phony barracks and tanks and knows this info must be delivered in person to the Fuhrer.<br /><br />However, he has to eliminate some Allied soldiers who spot him as he leaves the fake army base. Their discovery leads to cat and mouse chase.<br /><br />His escape via U-Boat 505 off the North Sea coast is hampered by a violent squall grounding all sea and air transportation. Faber is shipwrecked on a remote rock island with four inhabitants. There he must perpetuate his counterfeit persona until the weather clears.<br /><br />Meanwhile, MI5 is closing in while working on the scant clues Faber leaves in his wake. They too are hampered by the weather.<br /><br />The novel moves at a measured pace that heightens the suspense with each turn of the page. Faber is great villain whose cunning keeps him a step ahead MI5. The crew from MI5 are dogged in their pursuit and thorough in the procedural methodology. It is a remarkable match up.<br /><br />Using an economical cast, all the characters are fully fleshed out. You know everyone quite well.<br /><br />While the last 48 hours before the weather clears are intensely gripping, the entire narrative is mesmerizing and attention grabbing. This is a breathtaking \\"what if\\" take on an important slice of history.<br /><br />Since we all know how WWII turned out, the outcome may never be in doubt...but how MI5 closes the trap is a superb ride.crew from MI5 are dogged in their pursuit and thorough in the procedural methodology.

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|This movie has some good scenes, but its based on a worn out old theme (individualist hero gets screwed over by \\"the man\\" or \\"the system\\", gets roped unsuspectingly into some kind of a vague setup; then gets his revenge assisted by the innocent wholesome attractive woman, etc etc, blah blah...).<br />It never gets too deep, and as usual one wonders how the hero, Bob Lee Swagger, manages to make monkeys out of all the commandos sent to get him. Its based on a novel where the original Bob is a 'Nam vet, of course.<br />Wahlberg does a pretty good job as Swagger. So does Ned Beatty as a corrupt establishment politician; and the guy who plays the old gunsmith. But Danny Glover was extremely weak as the 'villian'. He looked and sounded like he was on something the whole time.<br />Farfetched conspiracy theory, but hey, thats Hollywood! And, to be honest, its an ok film if your into that type thing. But don't look for anything serious in it. Real military veterans may get a laugh out of some of the antics as well.
B00003BDXG|3.0|This film's theme is a common one. Catcher in the Rye, Clockwork Orange, Dubliners, Fahrenheit 451, Idiocracy, Waiting for Godot - the list goes on. The theme is what happens when a society no longer has a myth. If you miss this point you miss the film's point. People who pan this film typically aren't getting the point; instead, they're seeing it through a sociological lens. Oliver Stone - long-time disciple of mythologist Joseph Campbell - presents another depiction of this postmodern theme. The death of mythology is old news: Giambattista Vico predicted this four centuries ago, author James Joyce attempted to refecundate myth though his works Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, and Joseph Campbell observed we're currently waiting for the new myth to arrive. The NeoCon establishment - disciples of Leo Strauss - have attempted to build a new myth of \\"public presumption\\" of endless war of Good against Evil. But because it's a lie it won't last long. Or it will destroy us. Which brings us back to Natural Born Killers.     In a world without myth we create our own. Natural Born Killers depicts with considerable black humor how people living in a cultural vacuum of dead mythologies violently struggle to create their own living mythology. The killers, Mickey and Mallory, are psychotic, schizophrenic - (who knows?) - but schizophrenia is at root an inability to derive meaning from symbols. The pair run amok in an awful symbolic void, latching onto a smorgasbord of comic heroes, game shows, sitcoms, childhood memories, and courtship rituals. What's happening to them is exactly what happens to primitive societies exposed to \\"white man's culture\\": They collapse, succumb to vice, and disintegrate. Meantime, Mickey and Mallory struggle to establish a meaningful personal mythology of their own throughout the film: Marriage vows on a bridge, the \\"communion with angels\\" scene, reverence for any small kindness done them, the ritual act of mercy at each killing.     The film raises hairson the neck - and it's meant to - because Stone depicts what we've become and where we're headed. Beneath tawdry commercialism, career mania, suburban flight, vapid FOX news, political correctness, endless war and all we've come to accept as \\"normal\\" there is a very real and disturbing primal chaos that finds no living symbols or mythology to focus and balance its energies. This is an unprecedented development in the history of mankind and so what we face is unprecedented.    Shocking, violent, finely directed with a fine soundtrack. A powerful film of the chaos of being human in a dehumanized world.

For the amount of money it cost and all the music you get,including Morrisons version of CROSSROADS which is really good, this album has stood the tes of time and I bet you it will be part of yours,like mine,DOORS collection and be played alot.
B000VAPZM2|3.0|I think, they hurried to put this out way too quickly...It could have been so much better. With a lot more body to it. Maybe they don't give you all credit. Personally, I was tired of seeing Troy with the snivelling Gabriella. And it would have been nice to see a bit more depth to Sharpay.     The music would have been great if it did not sound like it was coming out of a distant box...I hope the SoundTrack sounds clearer than it did on TV. Our volume had to be turned up with every song just to hear the words, Except for \\"I don't dance\\" which sounded great.    The sound for me really let the show down. At least it affected my enjoyment of it. Considering it being a musical, you would think that would have been one of the main priorities.    Of course...this is my opinion. Give it a watch...and see what you think. I know with the first one, my daughter watched it nearly everyday for a week...with this one, which we recorded...she watched it the first night and hasn't watched it again since.This speaks volumes to me.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Disappointing on DVD. When this series appeared on UPN it was shown in Hi-Def.  According to IMDB, this series was shot digitally in 1080P/24. I have a 70 inch Top-of-the-line Sony HD-TV (KDS-R70XBR2). The network HD showings were spectacular, especially the opening. The eye-poping picture you invite your friends over to see what Hi-Def truly is.  The DVD release of Enterprise was not as good as most of the TNG DVD movies. I enjoyed the series in HD on the UPN network.  I would buy the series on Blu-Ray when it is available in that format.
B00061QK02|5.0|I was strongly objecting while this movie was being popped in the DVD player, but I completely changed my tune about 15 minutes in.  The last few Will Ferrell movies I saw were fairly stinky;  this one was a definite improvement.    If you've heard people spouting out random quotes that make no sense, they probably came from this movie.  \\"I love lamp\\", \\"I'm kind of a big deal\\", \\"Loud Noises!\\", \\"Pants Party\\", and \\"Welcome to the Gun Show\\" are just a few that sent us into hysterics.    If you've EVER thought Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, or the majority of SNL skits were funny then you'll probably enjoy this film.
