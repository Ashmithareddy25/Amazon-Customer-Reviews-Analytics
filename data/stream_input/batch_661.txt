0767836286|4.0|I avoid calling this a good \\"political\\" thriller, as I think the movie director might like to bill it, because the political motivations invoked to set the villains in motion here are almost ludicrous. This movie was made before 9/11 - so the film's \\"terrorists\\" are presented as a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy.\\" <br /> <br />However even this simple-minded conception of the threat of terrorism is muddied by Jeff Bridges' fervid ranting.  Bridges plays a college professor teaching classes in government, civil liberties, and terrorism. However he seems to be almost unhinged and perhaps suspiciously complicit in terrorist acts himself as he spirals off into confused diatribes against - first lone right-wing bombers like the Unibomber - then pervasive right-wing conspiracies - then the U.S. government itself, and specifically the F.B.I. Bridges blames all these entities for his wife's death, and his lectures apparently consist of little more than projected pictures of severed limbs and bleeding bodies left in the wake of such terrorist attacks. Furthermore, he incites his students to similar suspicion and hatred. I doubt that a professor who conducted his classes in such a way would hold his job very long. <br /> <br />So in order to enjoy this movie, it might be best to disregard all its muddled political assumptions. Just take it as a contest between some scary villains and some good guys. Then you can sit back and appreciate the very real suspense that this movie builds. <br /> <br />\\"Arlington Road\\" has one of the eeriest opening sequences I've seen in any movie. And then most memorable of all - is a scene involving Joan Cusack. We usually associate Cellular Joan with mildly comic turns. But one of the scenes featuring her in this movie delivers what is perhaps the ultimate jolting fright. It will probably literally make you jump out of your seat.  <br />

B000IZJZLM|2.0|I think they all have beautiful singing voices, but when aired on TV they sang in English, most of the CD was a different language and I was very disappointed with it
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Paolo Nutini is now my favorite artist to listen to.  Wow, He has such emotion in his music.  I hope he will be putting out more stuff.  He is only 19 yrs of age but seems much older in his sound and style. He is sure to go far. I love him!. Thanks for the fast service.
B0007M22TI|5.0|That's what I think of the \\"Celtic Women\\" experience....didn't think much of them in the first place when my girlfriend first introduced me to their audio CD. Thought it was another bunch of lil' known new age artistes doing covers of well-known classics & traditional songs with Irish / Celtic influences ie - Enya, Clannad etc<br /><br />But after reading the Amazon reviews, something made me purchase their DVD. Boy, did i enjoy myself. Seeing the artistes perform my favorite Celtic numbers live was totally different from passively listening to the CD. From the seraphic voices of Chloe Agnew and Meav right down to the mesmerising sounds of Orla Fallon's harp and the beautiful tunes from Mairead Nesbitt's violin, this whole DVD has a totally ethereal feel to it. All fans and purists should not miss out on this one. Definitely recommended for all, especially newcomers to the genre. Gotta thank my girlfriend for introducing me to them. Thanks luv, Celtic Women rocks!<br /><br />As at time of writing, I have already purchased the follow-up DVD; Celtic Women - Live At Slane Castle, Ireland just to relive the experience.
B000LC3ID8|2.0|\\"Saw III\\" should have been the epic, horrifying end to this demented series; unfortunately, it wasn't epic and it probably isn't the end of the series at all.<br /><br />The reason I enjoyed the first film was not the gore, although I have to admit I was impressed by the openly brutal scenario of people having to hack their own legs off in order to survive (one either overcomes the fear of horrendous physical pain or dies), but because it had a soul and a brain behind it: an atmosphere of mystery and horror pervaded it.  No one knew who was the vicious mastermind behind these inventive and repugnant torture/murders or who would go to such lengths to prove something to society about the depreciation of life. Saw II\\" carried on in a similar vein; more was revealed about Jigsaw and he was face to face with an angry cop who wanted his son back.  Still, we didn't know anything about him and it never became too personal; he remained a ghastly enigma with an intriguingly intelligent and thoroughly evil persona.<br /><br />In this movie, though, they make the character that could have rivalled Hannibal Lecter into a soap opera.  The film begins promisingly (an ex-con gets permanently reformed in a rather unorthodox way) and Jigsaw, ironically, has to face his own mortality through his imminent death by cancer.  From there it degenerates into tedious emotional dynamics involving his protege Amanda, a young doctor with a time operated shotgun shell collar around her neck, and plays an extended and really ridiculous \\"game\\" with a blameless victim of a drunk driver.<br /><br />The character Jeff and his \\"vengeance conflict\\" (how can you blame the guy for not wanting to save the guy who ran over his child?) is really just an excuse for us to watch Jigsaw's demented assistant indulge in emotional drama about her checkered and boring past.  Things get so monotonous that nothing shocks anymore.  The end is the most ridiculous plot twist I've ever seen and it isn't enduring what precedes it.  If they were going to do this, they should have ended the series with the original.what precedes it.  If they were going to do this, they should have ended the series with the original.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After watching Daniel Craig's Bond debut, the most compelling action movie I've seen in years, I felt the urge to go back and reread Ian Fleming's \\"Casino Royale.\\"  I did so with some trepidation that this book, which wowed me as a teenager, would fall flat under my middle-age sensibilities.<br /><br />To my relief, I enjoyed the book nearly as much as the movie, but for quite different reasons.  Fleming's writing style, a mixture of Raymond Chandler's hard boiled cynicism and Hemingway's heroic machismo, forms the image of the real Bond that filmmakers have been struggling for decades to capture.  Fleming's bond is a handsome man (love interest Vesper Lynd compares his looks to the 1950s-era musician Hoagy Carmichael) whose handsomeness is tempered by his cold, calculating demeanor, not to mention a nasty scar on the side of his face.  He's also a complex, philosophical man with sophisticated tastes in food and drink, interesting theories on gambling and luck, and a fierce loyalty to the British Secret Service (which he comes to question in a lively philosophical exchange with Mathis at the end of the book.)<br /><br />The film adaptation takes considerable liberties with the plot, updating this cold war spy novel to suit the threats of today's world:  Le Chiffre becomes indebted to a terrorist organization rather than a Soviet intelligence agency; wireless electronic gadgets take the place of blunt weapons; and Texas Hold `Em displaces Baccarat at the casino's high-stakes table.  The movie also adds a number of action sequences that play much better on the screen than would the many introspective passages of the novel.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, though more muscular looking and acting than I picture Fleming's Bond, channels the cold, calculating manner of this English assassin much better than Brosnan or even Connery.  I'm looking forward to the next installment in this revitalized film franchise.

0790734850|5.0|Kevin Spacey proves that he is a great actor in this one, and he's not even the main character. Guy Pearce's come-out movie showed that he could stand up at the top with the best. Russell Crowe's part is great for him. Really the first movie I saw him in, and you can see why he eventually won best actor in Gladiator. James Cromwell and Danny DeVito are perfectly cast in this film. If you like movies set in the 40s, 50s but with an edge with real life drama this is a great movie for you! Jerry Goldsmith's score is breathtakingly brilliant - he should have one the Oscar!
B000LXHK2C|3.0|What we saw of the DVD looked good, but the two DVDs in the store broke up and finally \\"stalled\\".  We ordered our own \\"A Good Year\\" and are hoping this one will have no \\"jerking, studdering, and crashing\\".
B000002UWF|4.0|A Baby Boomer like myself might have first thought that Louis Prima was too square.  But I thought I would try his music and I liked it!  I was aware of his catalog by current artists who had covered him (Van Morrison, Brian Setzer).  I found the songs to be an entertaining,\\"retro\\" experience. I enjoyed the different vocal styles with Prima's Louie Armstrong-type voice and Keely Smith's crystal clear vocalizing.  I loved the sophisticated, syncopated big band instrumental sound. And at a bargain price. I definitely recommend it!

1582701709|5.0|You know how you can meet someone for the first time and forever be stuck with the first impression of either liking them or hating them. This is the basic premise for the law of attraction which is The Secret. We are attracted to others (people and things) and others are attracted to us that match our vibration. This vibration has been refered to by many names: feelings, aura, energy, intuition, etc. The Secret is different because it is easy to understand. It is dressed up in hundrends of quotes from notable and ordinary people. If you are not used to reading then I would highly recomend this version as the author does a great job with the layout. It is a very easy read. However, if you are already familiar with the law of attraction, then this book is probably going to be too basic for you.

0596009208|5.0|I have done quite a bit of programming in assembler, C, and Visual Basic. I needed to learn Java. This book goes out of its way to make itself look like it's not a serious book, but don't let the outrageous pictures fool you. This book will teach you Java. The authors do a good job of presenting concepts at a measured rate. More importantly, they present a balanced picture of Java. They include the philosophy of Java, best use practices, syntax, and sample programs all at once. I am amazed at how easy they have made it to understand what Java is from the ground-up.
0099489988|3.0|I've been going through a chick-lit phase lately and this seemed like a good choice.  I was hugely disappointed.  The story is one I've heard a million times (except from an Irish perspective, which was a fun twist).  The biggest problem I found was it was so \\"wordy\\".  It was almost exhausting reading paragraph after paragraph of highly descriptive thoughts, only to find that nothing was really happening.  I'm a big fan of wit, but this was overkill.  I found myself skimming through it to get to the good stuff... which never really materialized.

0375703764|3.0|It was a fantastic vocabulary lesson, however, I bought into this experience under the assumption that it would draw me into a psychological whirlpool.  Danielewski clogged that toilet for me with overwritten rubbish and Picasso-themed word placement... which neither could possibly \\"add\\" to the experience.  It just made me look like an inconsiderate jerk on the plane trying to tilt my novel around to read it in my cramped coach seat.<br /><br />But, I must admit, Truant's psychological transgression in this novel was written extremely well.  This character was very well developed by Danielewski to the point where I, a sheltered female, could even succumb to the character's mental anguish and nearly feel it as my own.  His character starts out very inarticulate, elementary at best.  As he delves deeper into the plot's rabbit hole, his speech patterns change as his persona is scarred with experience.<br /><br />Borrow or rent from the library.  Don't commit to it unless something draws you in as it did myself.  Otherwise you're going to feel like you wasted a lot of time that you're never going to get back.

1582701709|1.0|My mother pushed this utter garbage on me when I visited her last month. Out of good manners I listened to the first two CDs of the audiobook durring my morning commute.  <br /> <br />To put it as bluntly as possible, if you take this stuff seriously you have to believe that Jews were responsible for the Holocaust because they were all attracting Nazism.  <br />All victims are responsible for what happens to them because they attracted it to them.  <br />Seriously it's that insane/evil/dumb.  <br /> <br />And Oprah should be ashamed of herself for peddling this filth.  <br /> <br />If this lunatic fraud spiritualist woman came on Oprah and said with an Aussie accent, \\"The Africans that came to this country in chains simply sent out thoughts that attracted slave ships. And then instead of thinking about what they wanted and focusing on that in the United States, they simply thought about how hard and bad it was to be a slave. And then they stayed slaves,\\" would Oprah be as quick to pimp for this fraud?   <br />Seriously it's some sick stuff.   <br /> <br />Do not support this fanatic. Do not buy this.

B0000C8AVX|5.0|This is a truly great album from cover to cover.  The mix of folk, rock, blues, acoustic and electric is dazzling.  Dylan is in a class all his own when it comes to writing and delivering a song.  It's All Right Ma and Subterranean Homesick Blues are Dylan at his wordsmithing best.  To my mind, Dylan's 4 great albums are this one, Freewheelin', Highway 61 and Blood on the Tracks.  I've never understood the acclaim that Blonde on Blonde gets.  To me, it sounds like he's drunk on about half the songs and his vocals are way off key in many places.  If I could take one album to a desert island, it would certainly be a Dylan and this would probably be the one.
B000LC55F2|5.0|A film that lives up to its promise in all ways. A PRESTO! ending. Great performances, direction, setting, dialogue, writing and editing. Don't let this one disappear before your eyes.  Getting into, \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Sleuth\\" territory.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Yes, Virginia there is global warming. Yes, it is a human made phenomenon. And, yes, we have to do something about it, pronto. This film lays out the scientific argument for the observations that scientists, and others, have been screaming at us about for the past couple of decades. For that alone it deserved the documentary Oscar that it won this year for, of all people, Al Gore. However, more, much more needs to be done to spread the word, and do something real about the impending sinkhole. And that is the rub. The ruling classes and their hangers-on have severely downplayed the serious effects on the globe of current trends. There is no will to fundamentally alter the squandering of finite global resources, although there is plenty of talk.    Those who have panned the film have done so on the basis of a political belief that god, technology or just hiding one's head in the sand will pull us through. Their main argument is that this scare-mongering about major planetary changes has occurred several times in the past and we are still here. That is a recipe for doing nothing and accepting that this capitalist-dominated world economy will find a way out. Of course by that time Kansas will be beachfront property. No, I will stand by the scientific method that underscores the intent of this film. Will some of the predictions prove unwarranted? Probably. Are there mistakes in calculations? Probably. But I like that way rather than depending on Exxon's, et. al good graces and explanations. There was a time when the ruling classes also aspired to use the scientific method to solve societal problems. That was the time of the classic bourgeois revolutions, when they were guided by Enlightenment principles. Now apparently astrology charts suffice. Move on over.

0783229526|1.0|Make no mistake I have read everything of Hunter Thompson's that I could get my hands on. I love Johnny Depp as an actor. However, this film does a true disservice to both of their talents. Johnny makes no sense as Hunter, although he was Hunter's friend. More importantly, Fear and Loathing does not translate on the screen as anything but a diffused and nonsensical homage to late 1960's counter-cultural self-indulgence. Of the worst sort.     Thompson always claimed that his literary attempt to use the tenets of `gonzo' journalism in the book was a failure. I disagree for the book but certainly not for the film. Let us face it this is classic case of the film being very, very inferior to the book, although the episodes and language of the film hew fairly close to it. Please, please read the book. You will laugh and be entertained by his drug-induced attempt to find the meaning of the American experience in the post-World War II world. As for the film it will give you nothing but fear and loathing.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|As a veteran action-flick fan, I found this film very satisfying on all fronts: the plot was believable and coherent, the bad guy was compellingly evil and arrogant; the technology was current and appropriate, the settings - specially Venice - were interesting, the female lead (Theron) was sexy and a nice mix of feminine, seductive, vengeful, and hard-nosed; the main and suppoorting characters were clearly-drawn, human, and interesting, the violence/action scenes were well spaced and paced, And the (classic) ending was predictable and still satisfying. I commend the writers, producer, and director for maintaining a steady level of \\"What's going to happen next?\\" suspense throughout the flick. Worth investing in, if you're an action fan!
B000065BPB|5.0|I've had a pair of Sennheiser HD-280's for a few days now and I'm very pleased with my decision to purchase these online even though I didn't get a chance to use them in real life first. It could be said that buying headphones without hearing them beforehand is foolish but having read plenty of reviews prior to ordering from Amazon, I felt like they were exactly what I was looking for. Upon arrival I felt like I got my moneys worth and the only initial complaint I could find with these headphones was that they're a bit smug at first. However, after wearing them in for a couple days they now feel incredibly comfortable, I wear them for hours upon hours without having to take them off as a result of ear soreness, there simply is none! As far as sound goes, I was really impressed. I don't claim to be an audiophile though, at most I've used a wide variety of cheap and somewhat expensive headphones over the years. All in all, if you want a great sounding comfortable pair of headphones for computer use or to listen to music all the while not spending a fortune, I give these headphones two thumbs way up. Overall greatness, couldn't be happier!
1400064287|4.0|You should buy this book if you want to improve your own communication or want to identify good stories and examples that will convey your message.<br /><br />The authors of this book define a sticky idea as one that is communicated in a way that other people listen and care.  Before you can do that, though, you need to know why it's so hard to do.<br /><br />The authors suggest that one reason is \\"The Curse of Knowledge\\" which they define this way:  \\"Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it's like not to know it.\\"  The Curse of Knowledge leads us in the direction of more abstraction and fewer stories, which make our communications less likely to stick.<br /><br />The authors identify six key qualities of an idea that will make it sticky<br /><br />They call the first quality simplicity. The idea is that you must identify your core message. This is the weakest section of the book.  When the authors say, \\"simplicity\\" they don't necessarily mean \\"something that's simple.\\" They really mean \\"core message,\\" the most important single thing about your message and the only thing you should concentrate on getting across.<br /><br />Alas, even with exercises, the authors don't do a good job of defining what this is. There is good advice here, but I still decided to think of \\"core\\" message as \\"topic sentence\\" and find help defining it in other books.<br /><br />The core advice of the book is: \\"Identify your core message and then use the other five qualities as a kind of checklist to help you improve your message's stickiness.\\"  Here are the five checklist qualities.<br /><br />Unexpectedness.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|Not sure what everyone else is seeing in this movie. That's one of the worst movies I've seen to date. And yes, Brad Pitt's acting was very so-so, plus there was a whole 5 minutes of it in the entire movie. He probably spent less time shooting it than those commercials he does in Japan. The stories that were shown were rather pointless and boring. I could barely finish watching it. Don't waste your time and money, this one is not a winner.

It is still a big hit! <br />The movie version is very well done and holds well to the stage version. <br />The movie has a few songs that some stage presentations don't use. <br />All of the music is very well done. Julie Andrews is brilliant, as always! <br />I feel that this is a movie that the entire family can view and be entertained.

B000LXH0AE|3.0|\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" explores territory that has already been visited by such movies as Adaptation, The Truman Show and even (obliquely) Dark City.  It does a passable job of depicting the life and \\"awakening\\" of its protagonist, IRS drone Harold Crick.  Unfortunately, Harold isn't really very interesting, and it's hard to root for him - he DOES work for the IRS, after all - and the plot seems labored after a while.  I recall seeing an episode of some TV show a few years back that was very similar; unfortunately, I can't recall the show, but I think it was the \\"new\\" Twilight Zone.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this a very weak \\"thumbs up,\\" if only because Maggie Gyllenhaal lights up the screen in her scenes.  Worth a look if you like slightly offbeat movies, but not especially memorable or moving.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|After reading all the reviews that said their discs were scratched and wouldn't play - I was skeptical about buying this DVD set. <br />As soon as my set arrived I checked each disc for scratches (not one!) and made sure I had all the right seasons/discs in order(yep!).  <br /> <br />I've watched all of Season 1 & 2 with no problems. <br />Looking forward to enjoying the last 3 seasons over the next few months. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000JBWWRY|2.0|I am sorry to say that the 'new' version of Peter Pan does not leave out the terribly racist scene depicting Indians as redmen unable to speak in complete sentences, willing to make anyone a member of their tribe and hand out eagle feathers to anyone who comes around. I am surprised this flies now a days, but apparently people aren't bothered by racism when those offended are fewer in numbers. It would be interesting to see what the backlash would be if this were another minority group.  <br />If you wish to raise tolerant children, pick another movie. <br />
B0002YLC24|5.0|I avoided watching this sequel until now, mainly because I didn't want to spoil the magic of \\"Before Sunrise\\". Despite the open-ending of the first film, I always expected the couple to meet again for their promised Christmas in Vienna. So to me the first film had a decidedly happy ending. \\"Before Sunset\\" of course is based on the premise that they didn't. Still I wasn't disappointed. \\"Before Sunset\\" is a lovely film, as beautiful as the first and ends on a suitably ambiguous and equally optimistic note. Filmed in real time, and taking place 9 years after the first film, it shows the pair meeting again, this time in Paris, the City of Love. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is now a successful writer on a book tour promoting his latest bestseller, an autobiography based on their one night in Vienna. Celine (Julie Delpy) of course lives in Paris and comes to his book-signing. They have one lovely summer afternoon together before he has to fly back to America. Like the previous film they spend it walking, chatting, flirting, teasing and now reminiscing, as Celine takes him through the beautiful streets of her home city, including a picturesque boat trip down the Seine. Watching the film is like slipping into a pair of comfortable old shoes, or as others have said, like meeting and catching up with old friends again. The whole film is a single long chat as they reveal how their lives turned out, why they didn't meet before this, what might have been, and rekindle the romantic spark that came to life 9 years ago. The dialogue is witty and always engaging and you never want it to end. The chemistry between the pair is as palpable and electric as it was 9 years ago. All throughout you long for them to stay together. <br /> <br />The script was written by Richard Linklater in collaboration with both actors which might explain the close affinity the actors have for their roles and the deep chemistry they exhibit. It's like they are not acting at all; as if we were given the privilege ofeavesdropping on two close friends deep in an intimate conversation. Absolutely delightful. Can't wait to see them in another 9-10 years as they recount what has happened since. That would be a treat indeed. Both actors have aged visibly but they wear the years well and it's nice to see actors who don't try to disguise their age onscreen. It adds immeasurably to the realism of these characters. <br /> <br />The film is presented in a modified form to perfectly fit the new 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen TV. It is not in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 contrary to what is stated on the backcover. The picture looks fine and I couldn't detect any major composition problems. Colours are fairly strong and natural. Black levels are accurately set with good detail in the darker scenes. The DVD comes with the obligatory theatrical trailer. There is a also short but treasurable 10-minute \\"On the Set\\" featurette with the director and 2 stars talking about their collaboration in making the film and how they wove their own life expeiences into their characters' fictional lives. Good to know that another sequel is still possible 9 to 10 years down the line. Let's keep our fingers crossed.
B000006OAM|5.0|I consider Ophelia the best album by Natalie Merchant; every song is a masterwork, the general sound of the album is really fascinating; I love it; songs like Ophelia, Kind & generous, Break your heart, King of May and Life is sweet are really unforgettable, after you've listened to them. <br />thanks Natalie.

B000AGTPUK|4.0|I purchased this move because I heard how great it was from many people, and they were right! I am a little disappointed in the DVD physically. The side of the DVD that is recorded on is discolored almost like a water stain. It plays fine though. I just hope in a couple of years this does not become a problem with its ability to be played. Great movie to have for when the holiday's are come around.

B0009SOFFY|5.0|This second, astonishing album by Detroit's The Stooges is one of the great, unadulterated, balls-out moments in rock music. This is the first--and last-- time that rock, punk, metal and psychedelia would all organically coexist on one record, and the album remains a touchstone for punk, metal and radio-rock bands.  ALthough many have tried, the intricate  and living fusion of hormonal scream, deep groove and self-sconsciousness has never been re-attained.  In this, their supreme moment, the Stooges wander through the drugged and adrenal detritus of the '60s with both distortion AND wah-wah pedals way up, and the result is simply intoxicating. <br /> <br />What appears to be on first listen simple three-chords-and-a-scream protopunk turns into something much more interesting. Don Galucci's production makes \\"Fun House\\", unlike their eponymous effort, really open up and breathe. Galucci creates a dark hint of space behind the lumbering swagger of \\"Down on the Street,\\" and on the buzz-saw \\"T.V. Eye,\\" the scream-and-howl sequence at the song's climax echoes eerily as the rhythm section shakes the listener buy the throat. Guitarist Ron Ashton uses wah-wah, fuzz, distortion, echoes, layered lines and everything from scratching to full-on howling feedback to give the songs layers and suprising intricacy.  The rhythm section is as heavy as it is wiggly-- Dave Alexander throbs when necessary and noodles when possible. <br /> <br />Riding this monster wave are Iggy's vocals. From quiet moaning of \\"Hurt\\" to the twisted screaming at the end of \\"T.V. Eye,\\" Pop is almost as mesmerising on record as, fights and broken glass antics and huge see-your-soul eyes, playing live. The music avoids the macho and sexist cliches of what would become metal and punk by not identifying Pop's Id with any political or social agenda.  Pop, unlike the metalheads he so inspired, is not afraid of mocking himself, leading to an odd and yet captivating emotioanl vulernability.  Mix this with the lumbering swagger of f*ck-me tunes like the animal-out-of-the-cage \\"Loose\\" and you get a kind of stoner sonnet cycle.  You get the feeling listening to this disc that Iggy is coming to you straight and effortlessly from the unconscious-- from the straightforward tunes like \\"Loose\\" to the paranoia and simple weirdness of \\"She's got a T.V. eye on me...\\" <br /> <br />The songs are heavy and groovy, sometimes tightly structured (\\"Down on the Street\\"), here and there touching (\\"Hurt\\"), and sometimes, as Henry Rollins once said, housewreckers that just beg you to pick things up and destroy them (\\"L.A. Blues\\"). This is deeply sexy, groovy and massively, MONSTROUSLY loud stuff, like its cover a maelstrom of sound, since unsurpassed. Like \\"Exile on Main Street\\" and \\"Zen Arcade\\", this record works as both beer drinking and dope-smoking music, equal parts adrenalin and groove. The Stooges, like Curt Cobain, felt hugely \\"stupid/and contagious\\", and mananged to infect all of subsequent musical history. This is THE loudest record yet made, heavy, groovy, nasty and totally sexy.   <br /> <br />The Stooges grab your neck.  They pound your head into the wall.  You begin to bleed.  And then you find yourself begging for more.  What else is there to say? Get it and turn it up, way up.
0618680004|3.0|No pathbreaking thoughts. No new conclusions. Peripheral compared to his other books. Nothing new to those who carefully follow Dawkins. If you have read his other books and articles, you won't find this book exciting as 'The blind watchmaker' was. But if you are new to Dawkins, this book is exciting and thought-provoking. And you will never be the same after reading this.  <br />Highly relevant, great book. Enough stuff to be a text books in all universities and all faculties.
B00005JP97|4.0|Good movie. After reading many reviews on this film on other websites i was a little reluctant to go watch it. Everyone was saying it was cheap, and that 3/4 of the movie was Ricci naked. However, it was nothing like that... <br /> <br />So story is about this young woman (Rae) who lives with her boyfriend (Timberlake) and is torn apart when he leaves for military training. After he leaves, Rae becomes very promiscuous, getting involved with every man she sees. One night she is beaten by her boyfriend's friend and she is rescued by a man named Lazarus (Jackson). He also has just been left by his wife, who cheated on him. They are suffering from the same loss and Lazarus ties Rae up and refuses to let her go. Along the way, hes helping her overcome her \\"sickness\\" of sleeping with everyone she sees.  <br /> <br />Good acting by Jackson, Ricci is pretty good. Timberlake still needs a lot of work but he manages to perform a mediocre role. If you read into the plot its pretty interesting. Two people suffering from the same loss. Each of their stories are told before they become reunited in an awkward way. Its great. Good plot, good directing, and good acting.  <br /> <br />The only thing i didnt like was the unrealistic fact that Ricci's white underwear kept being white after 3 days and rolling around in the mud...yeah ok i dont think so. Also, the movie started dragging too much at the end. It should have ended at an earlier point to make the story more interesting (as when they are singing together).  <br /> <br />An overall good movie. Recommended.
B00005JPLU|2.0|MOVIE: The name Frank Miller has become rather well known over the past few years to a wider audience. After Robert Rodriguez hunted him down to get his approval to do Sin City his graphic novels are now becoming a film genre within themselves. So, with Sin City 2 coming and a 3rd one being planned it was inevitable that some of his other books were to be adapted into films. What Sin City had (besides the awesome Robert Rodriguez directing) was a sense of ultra realism that worked. Rodriguez said he never wanted to adapt the graphic novel into a film, but rather adapt film into a graphic novel. The result was a gritty film noir tale that utilized its style to create vivid and entertaining movie. 300 is a bit different, in fact a lot different. What they did was in fact take the graphic novel and stick into a movie and I can say right here that the visual style is amazing. The film as a narrative is pure crap.<br /><br />Zack Snyder made his film debut by directing the very unnecessary remake of Dawn Of The Dead.  So, did Snyder make a good film with 300? Not at all. The movie is nothing more than yelling and screaming, half naked men, and slow motion killing. It's as if a Ridley Scott epic was sprinkled with crack and dipped into a bucket of sepia paint. The tale is known to all, 300 Spartan soldiers take on one million of the Persian empire in order to defend their nation. All in all, that is exactly what it is with no strings attached. The characters are never established nor are they developed. The film is not emotionally engrossing or exciting because we don't care about these characters. The film is poorly structured so the impact of an impending battle is rather weak. Just compare it to the battle of Return Of The King. Okay, maybe an unfair comparison, but recall how much set-up and anticipation was had before the first sword was swung. Recall the first scene of Gladiator, before our characters were even established there was incredible anticipation and set-up before the battle. Snyder thrusts us into slow motion spear stab after slow motion spear stab. I swear, if this movie wasn't shot on digital they would have used all the film in the world because of all the high frame rates required for slow motion. I am not exaggerating when I say that probably 50% of this movie is slow motion, even the sex scene is slow motion. The movie is one crowning achievement in visual style, but for what purpose?<br /><br />The only commercial appeal this movie has is its visual style, which sole credit goes to Frank Miller and Frank Miller alone. If only they used that visual style in a more cinematic way I think the film could have been so much more. The only focus here are the battle scenes, and while stunningly choreographed and amazingly shot they serve no purpose in the narrative. Another complaint I had was Tyler Bates' score. As a Hans Zimmer idolizer I love electronic and synthesized scores, but too much of anything can be bad. There are no thematic cues in the entire film and while Bates prove he can write grand and testosterone filled pieces he never structures them thematically. He even resorts to pure rock and roll at certain points in the film.  All I heard was a composer trying to replicate the masterful success of Hans Zimmer and his fellow composers. There was a lot of Black Hawk Down in that score and a lot of Harry Gregson-Williams' style from Kingdom Of Heaven. Bates just scrambled it in together to make it as loud as the visuals. The movie is a spectacular mess, and I know about 90% of the people who read this review will disagree with me. It's not that I think the film should have been more intellectual to be better, it's just it was poorly structured and not engrossing as a narrative, and by the end all I had was a headache.<br /><br />ACTING: The film boasts a relatively unknown cast. David Wenham is probably the most recognizable since he played Faramir in Return Of The King. Dominic West plays a corrupt politician (yes, the movie tries to be political for about 2 minutes) and he is probably most recognizable from his roles in Chicago or the HBO series The Wire. Gerard Butler plays the king of Sparta and he does have a strong presence. Even though the movie is all shouting he does a good job as the anchor of it all. He is from Scotland so at times I felt like I was listening to a young Sean Connery, but I liked him in the role. The movie really only demanded physical fitness from the actors since there was little room to show what they could do.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Go ahead, disagree with me all you like but you have to admit that the visual effects are the only drawing point of this movie.  Zack Snyder has proven he can make something look good with a computer, but he hasn't proven that he is a good filmmaker yet.  Anyone can look at a picture and try to do the best they can to trace the lines and come up with something similar, but no matter how well you trace the picture it will never be what the original was. Shallow and flat characters and a poorly structured story make 300 only a piece of eye candy.itician (yes, the movie tries to be political for about 2 minutes) and he is probably most recognizable from his roles in Chicago or the HBO series The Wire.

B000K7VHPU|4.0|This movie will hold you spellbound until the very end.  The filmography in itself is beautiful; like an old painting.  The plot is superbly wrought, filled with twists and turns and surprises.  I highly recommend this film as artistically beautiful and highly entertaining.
B000002I53|5.0|This album has always been a favorite since I first heard it in 1966. I mourned the loss of the album, but was glad to finally find it here. <br /> <br />Imagine, a jazz great, with a band of stellar performers, playing Rogers & Hammerstiens music, that Julie Andrews sang in \\"The Sound of Music\\"! <br /> <br />I think it very simply shows that a great muscian can do justice to any form of music. [Another example is Taj Mahal and the many styles he has played.] <br />If you can still get it, \\"My Favorite Things\\" is worth owning. <br />Will <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen most versions made of this book and by far this is my favorite.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel I've ever seen.  The novel was an early work by Jane Austen (published posthumously) so it's not as well crafted as later works.  Despite the novel's weaknesses, however, even this video production does not do it justice.  The heroine looks like she's on heroin, Maj. Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff.  I can't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one I chose or whether there was no other choice.  The only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships--before I read the book.  As they say, \\"the book was better,\\" and in this case, the old saying couldn't be more true.
B000005RT8|1.0|I'm the Beatles' number one fan.  McCartney carried on after they broke up <br />in 1969 with some of the best post-Beatles music, but \\"the good stuff\\" only <br />came out of Paul for about five more years.  \\"McCartney\\", \\"Ram\\", \\"Wings Wild <br />Life\\", \\"Red Rose Speedway\\", \\"Venus and Mars\\", \\"Band on the Run\\", and a few <br />great singles like \\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\" (banned in England) and <br />\\"Hi Hi Hi\\" (banned in England) were the only good stuff Paul has ever done <br />since the Beatles. <br />     Too much money, too much fame, he paid his post-Beatles bandmates  <br />peanuts and raked it all in for himself.  Money does corrupt.  Paul died <br />in about 1975.  Sorry folks.
0800141660|5.0|I loved this video.  I had seen the movie in the theaters (was it really 1995?) but ended up watching twice--first, straight through, and then second, the DVD feature of Emma Thompson's commentary over the entire film.  It was fun and enlightening.  I'm re-reading five Austen novels for a course, so seeing the film again helped establish characters and relationships.  The book is immensely better and actions take place in different settings than in the film, but the film's quality and fine acting cannot be denied.  This is a keeper and a wonderful addition to one's video collection.
B00005JP42|4.0|Johnson's screenplay is consistent, superbly delivered and adds immeasurably to the uniquely strange atmosphere of BRICK, as we are eased into something more abstract than the ususal mainstream screenplays written for people who want to be spoon-fed their art - and art, is what this movie strives to be. Burgess/Kubrick CLOCKWORK ORANGE - plenty of nifty mod-speak in that classic book/movie and no complaints worth a moment's notice. G.VanSant's MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO with Shakespeare to boot, hailed as a masterpiece - no pissing in the pants over the Falstaffian discourses there. And, what about all the Shakespeare - the  DaCaprio/Danes ROMEO AND JULIET, McKellan's RICHARD III, - yeah, it's Shakespeare and guess what, he belongs to Rian Johnson as much as Hammett, and he belongs to all of us. So, stop your yapping and keep up, you might learn a lesson, dog...dig?

B00005JPFQ|1.0|Not being familar with the comic or anything about this film my only expectations were from the trailers & I was not expecting much, yet I was quite dissapointed.  Completely predictable plot lines & one dimensional characters.  Special effects would have been kinda cool 20 years ago, but now they are just cheesy.  I could have stopped watching at any point & went the rest of my life without once wondering how it all turned out.  May have some value as a drive-in date film since your date will want to do anything except watch this film.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I am not surprised that this show was quickly canceled.  This is Joss Whedon's space western.  But this show was not cancelled because of bad acting, bad writing, lame episodes, or any of a dozen other common reasons.  The simple fact is this is a nothing show.  It is sort of like having a bunch of expensive, high-class furniture sitting in an empty lot.  In otherwords, quality merchandise with no framework.  I thouroughly enjoyed the acting, the humor, the drama, and the plots but I still could not help noticing that there is no series framework. <br /> <br />We have a space ship with a crew and several passengers.  The ship and crew are usually involved in illegal activities and some of the passengers are on the run from the law.  The Captain and first officer were involved in the losing side of a war and one of the law-fleeing passengers was mistreated by the government.  But why do we care about these people?  They are criminals.  There is nothing given to show that the government is bad except for what might have been done to one of the passengers.  We know nothing of the war other than who won (and one episode paints both sides as uncaring although it wasn't aired).  Unlike Joss's Buffy, there is no \\"in every generation...\\" framework or a \\"five year mission\\" like in Star Trek.  There is nothing.  I wish there was because the show had great potential and some of the best acting and drama of any series but it was ultimately fine furniture in a vacant lot.  So all we really have are a bunch of stories that happen to use the same characters but there is little to connect them and hold them together. <br /> <br />I know my review will not be popular with fans of the show (of which I am now one) but anyone who has seen the series should be able to see the truth in what I say.  If Joss has supplied that one last piece maybe this wonderful show would not have been cancelled so quickly.  There is one advantage to the lack of framework and that is that the show is muchmore watchable as an unfinished work than other shows cancelled in their first season.
B0002OERI0|5.0|ive never given a thought to Green Day before this... in fact ive spent a lot of time complaining about the state of modern music, thinking \\"my parents had great albums produced for their generation, what do we have?\\" and then by accident i stubled upon American Idiot. This alum is a work of brilliance, with a dynamic range of styles, moods, and unforgettalbe songs. The music manages to be bold but at the same time pretty subtle (for instance, \\"extrordinary girl\\" hints at Indian music just barely with its procussian intro, but doesnt overdo it like so many songs do when trying to emulate that often-used sound). The music seems to race forward with youthful urgency, and anthemic choruses ring out with instantly memorable melodies that sound like songs people could be singing in the bleachers at football games years from now. it sounds like something that could be absorbed into american youth folklore.     i would put the songwriting in the category of Beatles-quality, and thats not a compliment i give easily. it seems like my generation finally has an album with the same brilliance as Sgt. Pepper or Dark Side of the Moon had for my parents' generation... we have American Idiot, and i'm proud of that.

The story and filming were beautifully depicted and the characters' personalities  portrayed realistically by Giamatti, Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and the diabolical Rufus Sewell. The story has everything, historical interest, romance, mystery and intrique,and the fascinating topic of magical illusion.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|The recordings are great on the cd.  Having purchased the deluxe cd package with 4 extra songs and the locket was a good idea.  However - I would have really enjoyed the Complete DVD-CD set as there are even more songs on the DVD that didn't make the cd cut.  But which ever you choose, you will not be disappointed.  These ladies are stupenous talents.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|You will never find better music or staging than you will see on this DVD..., unless it is one of their other DVDs. Their voices blend extremely well and really sell the songs. I don't know how anyone would not be thrilled with this DVD.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|This movie starts out great, showing graphics and pictures of what's really happening to our environment. But unfortunatly, I think it goes too much into Al Gore's life, and that's where you loose me. I still feel I was told some very important information that I can never forget, but maybe if they cut out some stuff, it would be an excellent movie. I still reccomend everyone see this movie to save our world.

0783225482|5.0|Death Becomes her is star studded, spectacular, which is both thrilling and hilarious. I love it mainly for the fact that it stars Meryl Streep. As well as a fantastic actress she has the timing of a comic genius. The DVD has never before seen footage on how they created the amazing special effects and talks with the actors. If you like meryl streep, Goldie hawn, cosmetic surgery, a spooky sci-fi, rip-roaring comedies or just fancy Bruce Willis, you NEED to watch this film. I assure you, you will NOT be disappointed.
B000N6TX1S|4.0|First off, Clive...what can I say?  His acting is ALWAYS top notch and extremely believable. I have followed and collected ALL of his works including his various BBC Television series, UK films, the US releases and even have added The Hire short films in my collection. He acts with every fiber of his being and has the ability to draw you in using all 5 of your senses.  Brilliant and highly underated British actor!      There are a few questions I truly expected to have answered that weren't and that is the only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars.  However, the storyline is VERY fast-paced, rich and multi-dimensional and makes you ponder just how close we are to the fictional representation of society we see on the screen.     Man is self-destructing on many levels i.e. socially, economically, emotionally, physically and spiritually. I think this film covers all areas and hits you hard in making you consider YOUR individual contribution to society's demise.    I think the marketing and comparisons to heavy sci-fi thrillers such as Blade Runner is sorely misleading and may have contributed to some  viewer's disappointment.  This movie is more social commentary thriller than sci-fi action/thriller with a subtle message thrown in. This is in your face and makes you brainstorm the possible causes that resulted in the infertility of mankind to produce innocence literally and metaphorically.
B0009X75UG|5.0|Put the CD in and close your eyes and be prepared for a journey. It's very evocative of emotions of love and romance. Absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere is one of closeness... perfect for a backdrop of a romantic evening or to put in headphones during a stressful day.<br /><br />The reason I stumbled onto it (released in 1988 and bought by me in 2007) is the background singer Patti Austin. Anything Patti is in I buy.<br /><br />I have heard of Andreas Vollenweider from the smooth jazz stations but never paid him any special attention. I have been missing out for many years. I'm sure I'm in the dark about many artists and am grateful that Amazon and other sites have the listen feature.<br /><br />Will add more later. Still listening.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Esta es una de mis 10 peliculas favoritas de todos los tiempos. Compre el DVD por los 25 minutos adicionales que no aparecieron en el lanzamiento original, ya que estas escenas son \\"violentas\\" y coquetean con una relacion \\"mas de padre e hija\\" entre Leon y Matilda. El director tomo un gran riesgo con esta historia, pero fue sabio en su desicion de la edicion y postergar la version sin cortes para un futuro. Sin embargo, esto no altera la historia. Vale la pena.
0440419514|5.0|Although this series is marketed to an audience of children it is far from being children's literature.  Although it is a favorite of my own children, and I have given it as gifts to my own nieces and nephews, I gift it with a disclaimer to the parents to read it first. It is described by critics as being somewhat controversial unless you read it for the simple joy of reading books that are well written and entertaining.  It is filled with captivating plot(s), action, descriptive prose and has a philosophical/theological angle that is very thought provoking.  Many readers describe this series as \\"anti-God\\", \\"anti-Church\\", and to \\"Beware\\".  I, however, describe it as a wonderfully captivating fantasy that is a real page turner and difficult to put down.  It does speak from a totally unusual point of view regarding religion but I see it as more \\"anti-authority\\" than \\"anti-God\\" (God as believed in by Christians).  If you enjoy (or need) pure escape and love to be drawn into the world of fantasy, this is a wonderful story about two youngsters coming of age, witches, gypsies, armored bears, parallel worlds, physics, ancient civilizations, civilizations of unique intelligent animals, scientists, scholars, nuns and explorers.  There is a significant amount of death, pain and despair but not much that is related to true life situations as we know.  Although I haven't read other works by Philip Pullman, this series ranks him among my favorite authors simply due to his descriptive style of painting images in your mind along with his fantastic ideas.  If you get into it, you will be sorry when you are done with the third book.  It's a great mechanism for \\"escape\\".   <br />
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Excellent cd as others have noted. <br />Most of the tracks are great. <br /> <br />Standouts are: Air for Life, and: Can't Sleep.  They are simply superb.  Great music with variations of driving beats and soft interludes. Female vocals that are almost hypnotic. <br /> <br />Track: Good for me, is great as well. Soft, with great vocals. <br /> <br />Most of the other tracks are very good, but as noted by one of the other reviewers, I did not like voice of the male singer(s) on what otherwise would have been very good, if not great, songs. <br />
B00005JPLU|5.0|Before going to see \\"300\\" this afternoon I watched the 1962 film [[ASIN:B0001NBMDK \\"The 300 Spartans.\\"]]  I have a strong affection for the marching music in the film and the shot of Leonidas leading the Spartan phalanx for the last time, plus an enduring sense of injustice at the Persians dispatching the last Spartans by wave after wave of cartoon arrows.  I had read Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1569714029 \\"300\\"]] when it was first published in five issues so I knew what to expect.  This film is not history: it is art.  Granted, we are talking post-modern art, but that still counts as art in a world where computers are as important as cameras when making a movie.<br /><br />The Battle of Thermopylae was fought in 480 B.C.  The Persian army of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) is invading Greece with the largest army the world has ever seen.  With the Spartan army prohibited from marching north because of a religious festival, King Leonidas (Gerald Butler in fine form) heads for the natural bottleneck on the main road between Locris and Thessaly with the 300 men of his bodyguard.  After three days of battle the Spartans were betrayed by a man named Ephialtes who showed the Persians a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines.  While the rest of the Greek soldiers retreated, the 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians were slaughtered to the last man.  Simonides composed a famous epigram that was engraved as an epitaph on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae: \\"Go, stranger, and tell the Spartans, That we lie here in obedience to their laws.\\"<br /><br />Miller was inspired by historical events but was not constrained by it in telling his story.  In his version Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) is no longer a poor shepherd but a deformed figure who was born to parents who fled Sparta rather than leave their infant on a rock to die, adding elements of pathos and irony hitherto unseen with regards to the character.  Nor is this movie the attempt to faithfully bring Miller's art to life that we saw with \\"Sin City,\\" which is perfectly fine with me.  Besides, director Zack Snyder's film reminded me more of lots of other films, from \\"Gladiator\\" to \\"Hero,\\" more than it did \\"Sin City.\\"  I want to say that what we saw of this type of modern filmmaking in \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" has been refined, but that would be quite an ironic comment to make about such a gory and gritty film.  Ultimately, the movie is rather impressionistic in nature, emphasizing graphic images over everything else, which brings us back around again to the idea that \\"300\\" is art and not history.<br /><br />I was quite pleased the overall \\"300\\" met my expectations.  During the first part of the battle Snyder ([[ASIN:B0002ABURA \\"Dawn of the Dead\\"]]) resorts to the rapid series of cuts that I have come to deplore in contemporary action films because I can never tell what is happening.  I understand that a battle is a sea of chaos, but if I cannot tell what is going on I become distracted.  I want to see what is happening in order for the scenes to become memorable to me.  Fortunately the rest of the movie takes full advantage of slow motion technique we see in the trailers and television spots for the film.  In fact, \\"300\\" makes better use of slow motion than any film I can remember, mainly because the point is not to prolong the suspense (e.g., the end of the fight in \\"Rocky II\\"), but to let you see what is happening (e.g., River's fight scenes in \\"Serenity\\").  Think of watching big hits in football in slow motion replay and you get a sense of how Snyder is able to strategically slow down the action to see not only the power but also the grace of the violence.<br /><br />Looks are everything in this film, so the Spartans fight bare-chested, the better for their muscles to ripple, while the Persians might be the most overdressed warriors in cinematic history (although I admit that I have to wonder where the Spartans were hiding theirhelmets on the long trip from Sparta to the Hot Gates).  \\"300\\" is a film that glories in visual excess as the army of Xerxes becomes a computer generated million man march and the pass at Thermopylae exists between towering pillars of rock.  This may or may not be the most computer generated figures on the screen at one time in the history of the world, but I have to believe \\"300\\" offers the biggest piles of corpses we have ever seen.  As if quantity was not enough to overwhelm the Spartans, Leonidas and his men are confronted by a towering Xerxes and a host of monstrous men and animals.  The net result may well be the best comic book movie to date, despite the fact the hero is a historical figure and not a superhero.<br /><br />This adaptation plays up a subplot regarding what is happening back at Sparta while Leonidas and his body guard face annihilation as Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to play politics with Theron (Dominic West), who complains about the legitimacy of the king's actions rather than deal with the reality of a Persian army coming to crush Greece.  But it is hard to care about such machinations in the face of the historical record and the fact that the drama is happening at Thermopylae and not back in Sparta.  There are notes sounded about saving Greece from the Persians and civilization from the evils of Asian mysticism, but the legacy of the Spartans has nothing to do with their role in the development of democracy.  Almost two millennium before the Alamo there was this story of a group of warriors that sacrifice their lives in a battle so that their people could win the war.

B00005JPLU|4.0|\\"Sometimes reality is too complex for verbal communication but LEGEND embodies it in a form that enables it to spread over the world.\\"<br /><br />One might say FILM enables HISTORY to be communicated in the form of LEGEND to the movie-going public around the world -- and perhaps some young viewer will be inspired to learn more about the pre-Christian roots of Western culture and tell us how it REALLY happened.<br /><br />Whether '300' becomes in time a classic of blue screen technoloby, a legendary work of cinema art, a cult film for a few forever-adolescent comic book nerds, a morale booster for our military, or a popular blockbuster, I cannot know but there are scenes that will long remain in my memory, just as in 'Gladiator.' What is certain is that '300' replaces Millier's inspiration 'The 300 Spartans' as 'Classic Comics' film history. It surpasses 'Sin City' in its message & 'Gladiator' in its visuals and therefore both as a work of art. Only 'Pan's Labyrinth' does something equivalent in the films of the past year. The critics by and large have gotten it wrong because of their hidebound definition of what film is 'supposed to be.' It is pointless to quibble about characterization, historical accuracy, acting nuance, plot subtlety, displays of flesh and blood, when nearly every visual is as beautiful as one imagines an ancient tragedy to have been for its audience or the images in the minds of listeners when the ancient tales of mythic battles fought on the plains of Troy by mythic heroes were told by bards around the fire circle of a king's megaron. This is as Miller wrote it, a comic book version of history as told by a pop culture story teller, and the details are not important, nor is verisimilitude, because these things exist in the imagination of those who care to listen.<br /><br />But what a tale it is! Hurrah for King Leonidas and his Spartans! May his memory live forever among the all those who fought and died for their land, their city, their homes, their women and children.<br /><br />\\"And he who so falls among his comrades to lose his sweet life,<br />So blessing with honor his city, his father, and his people,<br />With a wound in his chest, wherein the spear that he faced has transfixed<br />The massive guard of his shield, and gone clear through his armor too,<br />Why, such a man is lamented by both young and old alike,<br />And all his city goes into mourning and so grieves for his loss.<br />His tomb is pointed to with pride, and so too are all his children,<br />And his children's children, and afterward all the race that's his.<br />His shining glory is never forgotten, his name remembered,<br />And so he becomes an immortal, though he lies under the ground,<br />When he, who was a brave man, has been killed by the furious war god,<br />Standing his ground, fighting hard for his children, his life, and his land.\\" -- Tyrtaios ca. 525 B.C.<br /><br />By the way, Lena Headey, with fewer scenes and a smaller budget, outdoes Angelina Jolie in 'Alexander' for conveying a combination of feminine strength of character & sheer sensuality.

B000O179EA|5.0|Just before doing \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" director Peter Jackson (who can be seen in a cameo as \\"Man with Piercings\\") made an off-kilter horror/comedy movie called \\"The Frighteners,\\" the tale of the undead and the guy who makes a living off of them. Though \\"Frighteners\\" was barely in theaters at all, this cult flick is funny, creepy, well-acted and wonderfully directed.<br /><br />Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) has seen spirits and apparitions ever since the car crash that killed his wife. Now he operates an amateur \\"ghostbusting\\" operation that is supposed to exorcise ghosts from people's houses -- the problem is that the ghosts who haunt those houses are in league with him (Chi McBride as the opinioated afro-ed Cyrus, Jim Fyfe as the nerdy Stuart, and most of John Astin as what is left of The Judge).<br /><br />Frank's business certainly isn't hurt by the fact that for years after a serial killer's murderous spree, people have died mysteriously of heart attacks. Then Frank starts seeing fiery numbers emblazoned on the foreheads of people who will die, including the husband of doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado). As if trying to stop a specter of death weren't hard enough, crazed FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) believes that Frank is the one murdering people. But the evil specter is still killing -- and Lucy is the next victim.<br /><br />Peter Jackson once said that he has a \\"moronic\\" sense of humor, and it shows up in all its glory here -- from bug spray dissolving a ghost's face to a piece of talking oily sludge to a drill sargeant ghost with submachine guns, this is weird and absolutely hilarious. It's the perfect blend of comedy and horror.<br /><br />But he's also good during the more serious moments, such as Bannister's flashbacks to his wife's death, or the eerie sight of homicidal young lovers dancing with a gun. The opening shot is pure Jackson, with the camera swooping through a window, past fluttering curtains, and though a hole in the attic floor to a screaming woman below.<br /><br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster. Nothing horrific is sacred. \\"There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of pissed-off brothers... that's ALREADY DEAD!\\" Cyrus yells at one point.<br /><br />Does it have a flaw? Yes -- the opening scene doesn't seem to make much sense later on in the movie. But Jackson makes up for that with a surprisingly tight, coherent plot, and a satisfying finale that makes more sense than most other horror movies do.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant, whether it's the twitchy, wild-eyed FBI agent, or the three weird ghosts. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Frank, with the right combination of cockiness and pathos, while Alvarado is solid as the idealistic young doctor. But the scenes are reallystolen by Dee Wallace-Stone and freaky-eyed Jake Busey, as homicidal young lovers.<br /><br />\\"Frighteners\\" might not make you believe in ghosts, but it will make you laugh, shiver, and maybe even shed a tear or two. Wildly funny, weird, gross, and sometimes really peculiar, this is Jackson's splatter-gore at its best.the attic floor to a screaming woman below.  <br /> <br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster.

B00005JPLU|4.0|Please remember that Frank Miller is a masterful comic book artist, not a scholar of classical Greece. He's sown a few seeds of fact and reaped a huge harvest of entertainment, so his result may resemble history as much as an oak tree resembles the acorn that it developed from. Fine. I can live with that. On the way home from seeing it, I listened to a radio commentator who couldn't. That's fine too.<br /><br />300 succeeds completely as a comic brought to the screen. It's big, bold, and bloody. (Very bloody, so decide whether that's what you want to see.) It has mighty heroics, and not just among the warriors. Even Queen Gorgo has her enemies, battles to fight, and sacrifices to make, though they differ in kind. The movie really finds itself in the larger-than-life scenes of war, though.<br /><br />That's where the effect-meisters truly bring the comic alive. Bejewelled Xerxes towers, Leonidas thunders, giants hew, gore splatters, and micreants skulk. Vistas are vast, and armies swarm. Mighty (if shallow) visions of valor come thick and fast. It's a grand spectacle, driven by comic-book concepts of might and manliness. It works at every level that it attempts.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B00004R99F|4.0|I had forgotten how awesome this movie is- even for a grown-up, like me. It could do without all the songs (it was made before Disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing,) but it's brisk, double-layered humor more than makes up for it. Kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly. Adults will pick up on the nearly-sarcastic, nearly risque dialog, so rare in Disney animated movies. Plus, Big Foot dancing to 'Stayin' Alive' is just freaking hilarious.  <br /> <br />Basically, it's just a Disney movie. But it's a *great (and severely under appreciated) Disney movie.
0446691437|4.0|Here's a great book for all reluctant artists and writers to keep in a handy place for a quick re-read whenever you start with the list of \\"why I can't...........\\"  (fill in the blank).  Mr. Steven Pressfield in his \\"the WAR of ART\\" grabs us by the scruff of the neck and gives us a good shaking like a mama cat with a kitten.  I didn't, somehow, like his writing but he conveys his subject matter so well that it was hard to put the book down (plus it made me squirm). I keep my copy tucked in with the dictionaries and thesaruses for whenever I feel myself waivering from the task at hand.  Open it to any page and Mr.Pressfeld will have some version of \\"shut up with your excuses already and get to work\\". A great gift for anyone who says \\"I would really like to.......\\"(fill in the blank).  Highly recommended!

0679746323|5.0|As a published author with a doctorate in modern Chinese history, I strongly recommend Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday.  It is an astonishing tour de force and required reading for anyone interested in modern Chinese, American, Soviet, Korean, and Vietnamese history, as well as anyone interested in sociopathic tyrannical leadership.  Although I cannot testify to the accuracy of every assertion in this book (and no single individual can), I believe, based on my decades of research in modern Chinese history and in discussions in English and in Chinese with many people who lived under the rule of Mao, that the general portrayal of that communist leader by Chang and Halliday is exactly correct.  This book will, I believe, stimulate enormous debate for decades in academic circles on the various events the authors describe, and it appears to have demolished many, possibly all, of the standard historical monographs dealing with Mao and the rise of Chinese Communism.

1582701709|5.0|I am amazed by the negative reviews. Well, not so much the reviews but what the reviewers choose to pull out of the book, cd or dvd to review..i.e. it is selfish, the weight loss portion, disease, etc.  This is purely put about positive thought.  You put out into the universe what you get back.  If you are consistently putting out the negative, bad humor, gossip, over all junk, this is what you will continually attract back to you because that is where your level of consiousness is.  You expect no different, well, guess what, you will get no different.  When you begin to change how you react inside you will begin to see change on the outside.  Focus on the good or positive and that is what you will receive back.  This can be, as the book, cd and dvd puts it the \\"Universe\\" or it can be God working in your life.  It will depend on your perspective and how much you want to analize how you relate to the world around you and what works for you.  I think this has been a wonderful experience for me and has opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of life - where before, due to culture, religion or what ever, I had a narrower view of what my life could be.  If you pick this up with a poor attitude then that is what you will get out of it...nothing.  If you are willing to open yourself up to the possibilities you will enjoy this and come away different.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|<br />My young niece Sarah and nephew Caleb are terrified of Walt Disney's 1953 animated feature, PETER PAN---the crocodile, a band of pirates, Captain Hook with a hook hand, a rock slide that seems to momentarily kill Tinker Bell.  The movie scared them so much in their younger days that they don't want to see it again, and neither does their mother.  I, however, as a 56 year old film scholar find the film delightful--a boy who can fly and refuses to grow up leads the Darling kids over nighttime London and to Never-Land, where they all get to fight with indians and pirates.  There is a Skull Rock, and a pirate cove, and a beautiful pirate ship.  It is all just marvelous for adults.  As for the crocodile, he is so stupid, boredly watching Hook fight with Peter until Hook falls into the water.  And Hook is an irresistible pirate for kids of all ages.  I love when Peter is on a mountain top pretending to be Hook and giving orders to dopey Smee in a boat below.  <br /> <br />The glories of this animated film are that it is animated so the wires don't show in spectacular flying sequences, again highlighted by \\"You Can Fly\\" as the gang flies over 1904 nighttime London, plus the prologue bedroom and all over Never-Land.  Hook has a real metal hook he deliciously screws on.  Tinker Bell is a real, jealous fairy and not a spotlight on stage.  And this is the one time Peter is played, satisfyingly and curiously, by a boy and not a grown woman, like Mary Martin on TV or Betty Bronson in a wonderful 1924 silent film version.  Also unlike, say, the Martin version, you can have spectacular fight sequences and the Lost Boys and Darling kids tied up by the indians, not a lot of wires and painted backdrops.  And the animation is magnificent, with deep colors and rich details, especially in this brand-new double disk Platinum Edition DVD, which also boasts an awesome 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theatre Mix soundtrack.  <br /> <br />Disk one has the restored movie, but also a very informative audio commentary with Roy Disney, Leonard Maltin, John Canemaker, Kathryn \\"Wendy\\" Beaumont, the woman who modeled for Tinker Bell, and surviving animators.  The late Hans Conreid did Captain Hook's voice to perfection, and Bobby Driscoll did Peter's. <br /> <br />Disk two has a good two hours of bonus material, including behind-the-scenes filmmaking documentaries, \\"Why I Wanted to Make PETER PAN\\" by Walt Disney from the archives, the history of making PETER PAN including storyboards for deleted scenes that go back to the late 1930's, an original never-before-seen opening to the movie, and a lovely deleted song that songwriter Richard Sherman and singer Paige O'Hara (Belle in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) have completed.  If Disney had made the movie in the late 1930's, it would have been very dark and frightening.  There are also games and activities galore for children and families, and a fun virtual flight with Peter Pan over London and Never-Land. <br /> <br />This PETER PAN has been painstakingly remastered and restored.  The 1953 classic  has never looked nor sounded this colorful and tuneful.  It belongs in every family's video library, even if it has moments too scary for small children.  They will grow into it, at which time it will be back in the Disney vaults on seven years moratorium; buy it now while you can. <br /> <br />
B000002KOJ|4.0|Joni Mitchell came strumming back in 1969 with the sophomore smash \\"Clouds\\". \\" Clouds\\" won a grammy, gained Mitchell a broader audience. It even included the personal version of the mega hit \\" Both Sides Now\\".<br /><br />All of these obvious features are not what makes \\" Clouds\\" special. The sincerity of the lyrics, along with the inspired mood pieces, is what lends this recording a cozy, warm feeling. Pensive brooding? Listen to \\"Tin Angel\\" or \\" Songs to Aging Children Come\\". Feeling light and breezy? \\" Chelsea Morning\\" or \\" I Think I Understand\\" are playful (former) and optimistic (latter). \\" That Song About the Midway\\" is truly a painterly song; the listener can see the sideshow and the slowing of the wheels, literally and metaphorically. \\" The Fiddle and the Drum\\" has a new resonance today. It didn't end with Vietnam.<br /><br />No Joni fan should be without this, but the uninitiated should enjoy it as well. Relevant material for modern times wrapped in warm melodies.

B000002GWN|5.0|It is my understanding that for those of us who came to this through CD, a lot was lost in translation from album. Apparently Joni talked quite a bit during these concerts. Only one comment made it onto the CD, in an effort to condense it down to one spin. What a shame!<br /><br />The beauty of the work is preserved. The live versions of \\" Cactus Tree\\" and \\" Woman of Heart and Mind\\" inspired me to immediately find the individual albums from which they came. Two new songs are offered, \\"Jericho\\", which later appeared on \\" Don Juan's reckless Daughter\\", and \\" Love or Money\\",a period piece that reflects 70's fusion sound. \\" Court and Spark\\" was the current studio release, but only one song, \\" People's Parties\\" is present. A great work, however, in any venue.<br /><br />This is a fantastic overview of Joni's work up to this point. It's also a pleasure to hear that voice live, knowing there are no studio tricks, that instrument really exists. Grab a front row seat and treat yourself to a tremendous talent.

The creatures themselves are excellently brought to life with some masterful puppetry and Joe Dante's direction really does the film justice.<br /><br />This movie is crammed with memorable scenes, subtle parody and excellent, yet quite humorous horror.<br /><br />  Ok, here is the deal.

If you haven't, what planet do you live on? It's like E.T. Everyone has seen that too. So why exactly are you reading this review??? For the sure comedy right? I know. Do us both a favor and pop this in your DVD player, or for the real enthusiasts the VCR, and watch it.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|The Video is great tells a story of love , life ,sacrifice, home and music.
0790731479|5.0|That quote \\"And it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it\\" will be put to good use, because that is what you'll say when you watch this movie again and again. What is there to say about Tim Burton? He can't stop with the good movies!<br /><br />This has to be up there in at least the top 20 of the best comedies of all time. It's twisted, but very very funny. I swear to you, if you watch this film, you will get one laugh. Probably more if you give it a chance.<br /><br />And of course, Beetlejuice is now one of the most famous charactors in movie history. Way to go, Tim!
B000060MWU|3.0|This flick was weird, and rather mind-numbingly so, even for a David Lynch film! It took me three watchings, half a bottle of tylenol (for the headaches it gave me) and reading about three or four interviews online with Lynch himself wherein he offered the only explanation that he could (something about a \\"psychogenic fugue\\"...?!?!) over this film and it's bizarre circuitous plot for me to even begin to figure out just what the heck is going on throughout half of it! Even now, I'm still not enitirely sure that I'm totally getting this or any of Lynch's films for that matter. And in my opinion therein lies the whole point/problem with Lynch's films. Meaning simply that maybe all of us spend far too much time trying to decipher what his movie's are all about, and that ultimately they may very well be nothing more than big elaborate jokes that he is playing on all of us in that no one but him will ever actually \\"figure out\\" his movie's and their supposed \\"meanings\\"...if they even have any at all! Though with that said I still find myself somewhat of a fan of the man's films as they are brilliant in terms of the production values (i.e. unique and meticulous set designs, the awesome, weirdo soundtracks, the costuming, the lighting etc.). I just decided some time ago to quit spending so much time thinking about his film's as it's pretty much futile in my book, and instead I just enjoy them for the wild, trippy mindf***s that they obviously are. And 1997's \\"Lost Highway\\" is one of Lynch's best examples of this. I highly recommened it to most people, however, those who aren't familiar with the man's film's before this one might want to try the more commercial and less psychologically mind-bending films from earlier in his career entitled \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"The Elephant Man\\". Oh, and I should add that the soundtrack may very well be one of the best ever created! Kudos to Trent Reznor and Lynch regular Angelo Badalementi for that one.
1401308201|5.0|Even if you have never seen the musical, this book is a must-have for every wizzard of oz fan. Great pics, great stories, and a splendid layout. <br />And after seeing the musical, its a great reminder of the best musical in ages!!!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This movie in intense and creative.  Violence is included along with a beautiful story line.  Highly reccommended.  Our family loves it, but our young girls 6 & 8 have only seen some parts allowed by us.  Loved this movie and any others by Miyazaki.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I loved these books, but 5 minutes into this movie I wanted to walk out of the theaters.  The story was changed so much that it was basically LOTR. Save your time and your money, if you have to see it what for it to come out on cable.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This director created 21 grams and Amores Perros which came out quite a while ago. Crash and Traffic copied the storytelling style of interweaved stories, so quit calling this a bad imitation or whatever... <br /> <br />This film was created as a piece of art: the director had something he wanted to say, so he made a film to say it. Complaining about incoherent storylines and lack of momentum is therefore not as important as some reviewers would have you believe. I wonder what the people calling this \\"the worst movie ever\\" based on those criteria would say about a Jean-Luc Godard or Federico Fellini movie? <br /> <br />I was puzzled by the Moroccan sex story, but far from revolted. And I think the nudity in the Japanese story was crucial to the story.
0072950463|5.0|Over 5 years as an aerospace engineer at Boeing and Lockheed Martin, I have used this book far more than any other for aeronautics. This is not only a good textbook, but an excellent reference, and one of the few technical books I have found worth reading cover-to-cover. Many engineers simply say \\"look at Anderson\\" to find whatever answers you need.
B000002U9W|4.0|Atom Heart Mother was the album where Floyd's classic sound really started maturing and coming together.  Though it retains the experimental spirit of Ummagumma, the results here are much more focused and enjoyable. <br /> <br />The album's reputation for \\"weirdness\\" largely comes from the lengthy suite that takes up the first half.  Though the idea of adding brass orchestration and a large choir to a Floyd piece might lead some to dismiss this as a pretentious rock-classical crossover piece, it's just too eccentric and entertaining.  David Gilmour offers some fantastic guitar playing, there's a great \\"funk\\" section, and the melodies are first-rate.  It's not quite a masterpiece on the level of \\"Echoes\\",  but I think fans of Floyd's instrumental side will find a lot to enjoy here. <br /> <br />The second half of the album is more \\"normal\\".  Waters, Gilmour, and Wright each offer a tune, of which Gilmour's \\"Fat Old Sun\\" (classic guitar solo) and Wright's \\"Summer '68\\" are the best.  Pink Floyd wasn't always dour and angry!  The album closes with the thirteen minute instrumental \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\": pleasantly melodic but (perhaps) lightweight playing by the band while a recording of their roadie making breakfast plays in the background.  Marmalade, I like marmalade. <br /> <br />Fans of the atmospheric soundscapes of Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here will probably like this album.  Just don't expect angry or political lyrics by Roger Waters; there isn't any of that here, just interesting music. <br /> <br />One last comment: the album cover is a classic.
B00001OH1S|5.0|This is a great CD containing most of the melodies and songs from the movie except for the Latin dance during the black and white party. I especially enjoyed Sting's Windmills Of Your Mind which is not released on any other CD (I believe) and Nina Simone's \\"clapping\\" song. One of the rare soundtracks that has all great songs and melodies in one!
B000002U8G|4.0|This is probably the most popular, and arguably the best, of Pink Floyd's pre-Dark Side albums.  (Possible exception for Piper, depending on your tastes.)  The band's sound started coming together on Atom Heart Mother, but things really clicked on (parts) of Meddle.    The album opens with the fierce (mostly) instrumental rocker, \\"One of the These Days\\".  A live favorite both before and after Roger Waters's departure from the band, it contains a classic bassline, some naaasty wailing by Dave Gilmour on guitar, and a rare vocal by Nick Mason threatening to cut you into little pieces.    The album closes with what may be the best track of Pink Floyd's career, the epic \\"Echoes\\".  Starting with a ghostly \\"ping\\", it contains several lengthy instrumental sections and some haunting singing by Gilmour and Rick Wright.  The music fades into a \\"noise\\" section, then comes back to life in a fantastic, explosive climax.  It's more raw and loose than Floyd's later studio-perfect work, but If you like Pink Floyd's instrumental side you will definitely enjoy it.    The four tracks in the middle of the album range from OK to good, but are really inconsequential compared to the first and last tracks.  \\"Fearless\\" is a nice upbeat track, \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" is a pleasant love ballad, \\"San Tropez\\" is a cheerful (with vocals by Waters, of all people) vaguely jazzy tune, and \\"Seamus\\" is a blues with a barking dog solo.  It's almost like the band had to lighten the mood and intensity before and after the two best tracks.    If you consider Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here to be the best of Pink Floyd's studio albums, then this album is an absolute must.  It contains some of their finest work -- the four band members working perfectly as a unit with their egos in check.
B000002G23|5.0|I don't own this, but from just looking and listening to what is on these CD's, I know that there are more than one version of some of these songs (like message in a bottle which sting performed solo as well, and in fact sounds better that way).  I think masata tango has a slightly different version as well.  Other songs (such as \\"Tea in Saraha\\"), imo, sound better when there are not live.   <br />That being said, I suspect that some of these songs you might not be able to get on CD (maybe, maybe not - depends on the song). <br />A very good collection nonetheless if you are a Police fan.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I love this CD---Heard a sample of his music on a daytime talk show. <br />And ordered it that some day. The CD arrived in perfect condition and sounds great. Thanks

B0007KTBIU|5.0|My favorite Disney movie of ALL time and this is a wonderful DVD! It has extras on a second dvd and the scene of Pocahontas and John Smtih singing together was added back in! GREAT DVD!!
0812550757|5.0|Card does it again with Speaker for the Dead. Amazingly brilliant. You won't be able to put it down.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This is a thought-provoking, extremely well-shot movie that, once again, explores the theme of \\"intersecting lives\\" that Inarritu seems to be very fond of. Like \\"Crash\\", its intentions are honorable but, unlike Crash, it is thoroughly depressing. I found some of the scenes very hard to sit through. Even though it was a very unique movie experience, I don't think I would ever want to watch it again.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Even in the teaser trailer phase of a film's release, many people were not anticipating Cars that much. Was it because they had come off the action-packed the Incredibles and people weren't exactly revving (pun maybe intended) for talking cars? Or was it just simply the idea seemed weird? Whatever the case, the general reaction upon its release was it was good-but-not-great; the one that ruined Pixar's 6 for 6 winning streak. So is it that bad? Well no, but the idea this is a horrible film is just really pushing it but it's still a lesser effort. <br /> <br />In a world where everyone and everything's car-related, the story centers on Lightning McQueen, a hotshot racer who only thinks of himself. After a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup and on route to California for the finals, he's accidentally dumped on the Interstate and ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs. There, he meets a number of cars trying to keep their struggling town alive while Lightning learns it's better to think of more things than winning. <br /> <br />Let's get the good stuff out of the way. While everyone sings 3D animation praises, a slight backlash was created when Disney at one point abandoned traditional 2D thanks to the failures of Home on the Range and Brother Bear, making audiences hate 3D a bit since more and more (and more) 3D movies were being released. But still, the computer animators outdid themselves since almost every new camera angle gives us something to marvel; from the neon lights to the sheen of polished cars to the landscape. It's also a bit more movie-esque in the more bigger action scenes, making it a bit more dynamic. There's also some inspired gags like bugs that are actually Bugs as in Volkswagon Beetles while cow-tipping as been replaced by tractor tipping.  <br /> <br />In a couple of commentaries, Pixar head John Lasseter said that a goal of Pixar was to make you see familiar worlds in a new light. Imagine toys that can talk, monsters having feelings or the burdens of being a superhero. Does anybody really wonder what a car does? While that's not to say the idea at least sounds pretty neat but it just seems awkward that we have to get sympathetic to a talking car. While I'm not being kind of pessimistic and it's unfair to say every Pixar film has to be at least masterpiece-level or it's awful, you can admit at least there's some problems with the film anyway. <br /> <br />One problem is the story. It's weird how there's as much as 6 people who work on the screenplay yet it feels so padded in its story. There's a whole lot of scenes that are meant to develop everyone but everyone seems kind of one-dimensional anyway and main hero Lightning just sounds like a jerk all the way through even with a newer enlightenment (could be a Owen Wilson problem though). The James Taylor \\"Our Town\\" song is meant to be the emotional scene but it pales to the Sarah McLachlan-sung \\"Jessie's story\\" scene in Toy Story 2. The voice acting is a bit more stunt casting, probably catching it from Dreamworks' tendency to get big-name stars to voice everyone.  <br /> <br />Pixar was excellent when it came down to DVD's packed with information about making the film. Sure A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films started out kind of thin but when Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and the Incredibles had top-tier DVD's, seeing Cars quite small extras is disappointing. We get the kinda-funny short One Man Band while a new short involving the tow-truck Mater is not that funny. Everything else is light on insight and you'll instantly think of a double-dip in its future. But strangely, I ended up buying it anyway knowing there was a bigger release somewhere in the future. It'll probably come around Ratatouille's DVD release (which, by the way, looks quite promising). <br /> <br />I don't love the movie yet I don't outright hate it and I won't hold Pixar's past achievements against it but based on the film alone, it is a bit disappointing there's just some issues that the film has you wish were fixed.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|she has a beautiful voice - no question about it... but somehow I think that all the newcomer magic that surrounded her first album is suddenly gone and she hasn't been able to transcend... with a rare exception throughout the album (i.e. \\"sinkin' soon\\"), she pulls the same notes, same inflections, same dynamics, same attitude, same instrumentation, same arrangements, perhaps the same background voicings and harmonies... just new lyrics and therefore new songs... but not new music
B0000027I6|5.0|This is his best piece by far.  Great songs that where recorded well in the studio. Buy this cd and you won't regret it.
0066620996|5.0|Chances are you have already read this book because every where you go, you will find business people referring to concepts like the 'hedgehog' or 'getting the right people on the bus'.  <br /> <br />Whether you consider the ideas unique or not, the way they are expressed has resonated with so many people that they have become part of the language when business people communicate. <br /> <br />Great books (for me) don't just inform, but they stimulate thinking and action - they create excitement in the possibilities of what my business can do. This is a great book.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|Today is a sad day for 'Boston' fans.  The magical voice behind the band, Brad Delp, passed away at age 55.  Another rock great taken from us way too soon.  The rawness and emotion of Delp's vocals, the melodic dual guitar interplay between Barry Goudreau and Tom Scholz as well as the novel sounding, spaced-out guitar crunch effects of Scholz, put Boston in a class of their own.  This first Boston album was an absolute milestone in rock history (1976), and easily one of the top, definitive releases of the 70's. I was in high school in New Jersey at the time, and remember the utter frenzy created at the local record stores when it was released, following the success of 'More Than A Feeling' and 'Peace Of Mind' on the radio. There was a huge line going around the block, with police barricades just to get the debut album! I'll never forget it. In addition, whether many realize it or not, it was bands like Black Sabbath, Rush, Led Zeppelin, UFO, Boston, early Scorpions, etc. that spawned and influenced the Heavy Metal genre afterwards, and prompted many a pimply faced teen to pick up a guitar.    R.I.P. Brad Delp... you were a consummate rock star amongst STARS!!!!
B000EYK2GE|5.0|Having seen this session on tv, it's wonderful to relive the moment through cd.  Even if you're not a rabid George Harrison fan, as I am, I think you'll still find it a great listening experience with Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr and the old guy himself, Carl Perkins, who gave us so many memorable tunes.  They're not dead yet as long as we have their music to listen to.
B0007SMD3W|5.0|It's hard to believe this is the same band that later became the very epitome of synth-laden '80s arena rock.  But then, in a way, it's not the same band.   <br /> <br />Long before Phil Collins took the wheel, a bit before he'd even come on board for that matter, several years before the myriad side-long song suites and ambitious concept albums, there were five friends from prep school who made pretty and very British songs together.  Their big break came when then-pop star Jonathan King heard a demo tape and was impressed with Peter Gabriel's vocals.  They still sound great.  So does the mostly mellow music backing him up, even if the band themselves thought it was a bit too mellow at the time.  Their youth at the time does show through in some of the lyrics, which have all the usual prog-rock markings of royalty and chess and love and isolation and concern with the meaning of it all.  But for the most part, the songs work well not inspite of the fact that they were obviously written by well-read teenagers, but because of it.  It's the sort of youthful pretention and ambition that can't be faked, and it sounds entirely real as a result.   <br /> <br />And just what do those songs sound like?  They remind me of very early Pink Floyd with a bit more real world sensibility, or the early Bee Gees without the pervasive mopiness.  The musical style is a bit more folk-ish than most other prog-rock (much more so than later Genesis), with acoustic guitar and piano riffs figuring prominently in most of the songs.  The same is true to a lesser extent of the extra tracks that did not appear on the original album, but they do sound even further removed from the later Genesis sound.  The two single B-sides, \\"One Eyed Hound\\" and \\"That's Me,\\" are perhaps the one and only indication that these guys grew up listening to The Beatles and the like.  While they have the same art-rock styling heard on the album tracks, they also have a touch of the poppiness that defined early British rock.   <br /> <br />Fans of their later work might not like what they hear here, and those who loved to hate Genesis in the '80s might find they love it.  It's worth a listen for anyone who likes folk-rock and early prog-rock, in any case.
B000M341QO|5.0|Great movie! Not for the faint of heart. Non-stop action. A true roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Highly recommended!

B000LXHK2C|4.0|OK it's not the Gladiator, it's a date film for the most part think of Russell Crow. A very busy high pressured stock trader inherits his uncle's chateau and vineyard in Provence, where he spent much of his childhood. He discovers a new laid-back lifestyle as he tries to renovate the estate to be sold per IMDB's plot line. That's pretty much it in a nutshell plus in addition that he finds love and discovers a few facts about his uncle and childhood. I'm not sure about the role of his long lost cousin and Uncles love child, didn't really see a point to her role in the film. The movie a slow moving, but isn't that the point? Busy guy finds laid back lifestyle? So as one would think the trading shots are fast while most of the movie shot at the chateau and in and around Provence are slow and easy going. Myself having forsaken the busy life in exchange for the rural slower life can relate to this film and I found it enjoyable, my wife found it enjoyable. It's a good dinner and movie film, not action packed adventure, not a side splitting comedy, it's not a shoot'em up film, but that doesn't mean it is to be dismissed either. Granted it boarders on being a chick film, but guy can enjoy it too. Albeit, most won't admit it, I for one admit it was entertaining.
0140143505|5.0|What a breath of fresh air this book was to read.  It was an uplifting, humourous story of the long distance correspondence of a used bookstore and its workers in London and the buyer in America whom they worked with long distance, over 20 years, fulfilling her love and want of specific books. It left the reader very satisfied.
0765348276|5.0|Novel and clever premise that is well developed and plausible, especially appealing to us old guys.  Very well done battle scenes.  Highly recommended.
B000J103PC|4.0|A delightful excursion through the world of Haute Couture<br /><br />and magazine publishing set amid glamorous Paris and New<br /><br />York. The film is an adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's<br /><br />best-seller, which was based on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-<br /><br />Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue). Andy Sachs (Anne<br /><br />Hathaway) seems a fish out of water when she interviews<br /><br />for a job as the second-assistant to Miranda Priestly<br /><br />(Meryl Streep), editor of high fashion magazine, Runway.<br /><br />Andy wants to be journalist, and is only working there to get survive until she gets a break for her writing.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: ...You have no sense of fashion...<br /><br />Andy Sachs: I think that depends on...<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: No, no, that wasn't a question.<br /><br />But Andy is smart, though at first naive, and after being<br /><br />hired, she tries hard to please the devil in Prada,<br /><br />Miranda. Pleasing Miranda, however, is quite a challenge.<br /><br />Completely self centered, she makes impossible demands<br /><br />such as a flight out of Florida during a hurricane, or the<br /><br />unpublished manuscript to the latest Harry Potter book for<br /><br />her twins. Streep is the consummate bitch delivering such<br /><br />lines as:<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: Find me that piece of paper I had in my<br /><br />hand yesterday morning.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: By all means move at a glacial pace. You<br /><br />know how that thrills me.<br /><br />Miranda Priestly: Details of your incompetence do not<br /><br />interest me.<br /><br />Contrast this Ice Queen with the laid back character she<br /><br />played in Prairie Home Companion, and you begin to get a<br /><br />sense of this actresses extensive range. This role earned<br /><br />her an Oscar nomination. Well deserved, I might add.<br /><br />First-assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) would be only too<br /><br />happy to sabotage Andy, but if she were fired just now<br /><br />that would dash her dreams of attending the fashion events<br /><br />in Paris. Lots of catty comments from her. My fav:<br /><br />Emily: Okay, I am hearing this...<br /><br />[She moves her hand in a speech mimiking sign]<br /><br />Emily: And I want to hear this.<br /><br />[She closes her hand]<br /><br />Can't wait to use that one.<br /><br />Art Director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) gives an excellent<br /><br />performance, mentoring the ingenue, without ever losing<br /><br />his satiric edge or giving in to the sacharine. Upon first<br /><br />seeing her he dashes off the following withering remark:<br /><br />Nigel: Who is that *sad* little person? Are we doing a<br /><br />before-and-after piece I don't know about?<br /><br />When she turns to him, after a particularly cruel session<br /><br />of torture from Miranda, instead of sympathy he tells her<br /><br />bluntly that she disrespects the Art of Fashion, the role<br /><br />of the magazine, and the impact of Miranda upon that Art.<br /><br />Nigel: Other girls dream of working here. You merely<br /><br />deign.<br /><br />Later, after seeing that Andy is smart and capable, and<br /><br />trying to meet the challenges of her job, he gives her a<br /><br />pair of Jimmy Chu high heels. She tells him they are not<br /><br />for her, but soon after when Miranda glares at her<br /><br />sensible shoes, she puts them on Tout de Suite. This is a<br /><br />turning point for her character, who finally gets in the<br /><br />game, embracing the world of fashion, and dances with the<br /><br />devil. Andy is now known as Andrea, and she finally gets<br /><br />some good barbs of her own, such as when sexy writer<br /><br />Christian Thompson (Simon Baker) attempts to seduce her in<br /><br />Paris:<br /><br />Christian Thompson: Je suis tr&egrave;s, tr&egrave;s d&eacute;sol&eacute;.<br /><br />Andy Sachs: You're not that d&eacute;sol&eacute; at all.<br /><br />Director David Frankel was also responsible for Sex in the<br /><br />City, and this film exhibits the same witty dialogue, the<br /><br />same heady mixture of comedy and drama, that will keep you<br /><br />entertained right up to the final d&eacute;nouement.ll keep you   <br />entertained right up to the final dénouement. <br />
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This DVD is fantastic,  WITH ADECUATE EXTRAS AND ALTERNATING ENDINGS. <br /> I love the possibility to select Full Screen mode but I HATE THE TWO DISCS IN ONE (\\"DOUBLE FACED\\" DVD !) <br /> <br />If it came in  two discs-set instead of one... it deserves 5 stars.

0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a woman of amazing courage and strength.  Her book reads like a great adventure as she traces her path from submission and oppression to being an independent secular woman who thinks for herself.  Despite the brutality she both endured and witnessed, the book does not contain a trace of self-pity.  Her delight at discovering Western ideas and values as she studies politics and history in Holland is wonderful to read.  This book gives a good representation of the values of Islam and the destructive effect they have on the lives of both women and men.  It is the story of a woman who had the courage to break free from that culture.
B0001FUHV6|5.0|If you love piano music, you'll love the music from this movie.  The movie was great as well.
B000000WFZ|4.0|Maestro Morricone's music is unlike that of any other film composer I know of.  Yes, he does have his trademark compositional techniques, but his music really does stand alone.  I recently sang in a concert with the composer and one of the pieces we sang was \\"On Earth As It Is In Heaven\\".  Although the chorus in this CD is good I feel a sort of grainy texture and feel as if the chorus is far away.  The second chorus group, labeled \\"voci folk\\" that sings a rather rhythmically challenging part, is inconsistent in its presence.  At times it is clearly heard and at other times it seems very muffled and hidden.  Kudos of course to the oboe player.  The haunting and very beautiful theme from \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" is absolutely wonderful.  If you haven't seen the movie rent it.  It's interesting to see how the music fits the scenes.
B000000OF6|4.0|Freddie Mercury can never be replaced. This music collection is a good place to understand the talented Freddie Mercury.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|Religious controversy aside, this is Neal Morse's finest solo effort. Miusically, it incorporates flashes of Spock's Beard, Transatlantic and his previous solo work. All of the virtuoso musicianship compliments of Mike Portnoy, Randy George and a guest spot by Paul Gilbert make this an essential listening. This is filled with complex musical passages, melodic themes, and interesting shifts- classical to latin to metal etc... <br />Neal has finally put it ALL together on \\"Sola Scriptura\\"! At times, some of the music sounds familiar from past projects, but hey Neal is allowed this privelidge since it's his creation. If you are a fan of Spock's Beard and Transatlantic -BUY THIS TODAY. Keep an open mind with respect to the religious theme, and enjoy! \\"Sola Scriptura\\" - the ONE Neal Morse solo project you need to have in your collection.
0345440927|5.0|I have to tell you after reading the Baby Whisperer there was no way that I wouldn't have bought this book.  It has given both my husband and myself great insight into the mind of our 14 month old and I'm sure it will help even more as the toddler years progress.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Sad state of \\"rock\\" today, I mean when I read that this band is actually trying to bring back 70's type \\"art\\" rock with their format, I want to hurl.  If you want that, then listen to Yes or Blue Oyster Cult or what have you.  Don't grab an album from hacks that cannot play who are trying to rehash an old formula.  The result is a lot of uninspiring garbage.  Poor vocals yelling the typical anti-war slogans, I mean that is great if they were the first but Pearl Jam, Ministry and KMFDM have been doing it for years now.  Suddenly we are supposed to find meaning coming from a Darren/Darin/ who spells it D-a-r-r-o-n?  Worst songs are Revenga and Cigaro but none of them get as high as three stars in my book.  Needless screaming, pointless yelling and guitar chords that slam and chug with no direction.  So yeah, I would suggest check out some other bands before jumping on this bandwagon, which has already hitched onto the coattails of about every idea that has come along in the past 30 years.  Uneventful, moderate at best, but for the most part just not music.  Show some meaning in the lyrics, or some intelligent playing.  I know garage bands that have more purpose, but hey these guys got signed so now everyone is assuming it's what's for dinner.

B000G759LW|3.0|As soon as I found out Christina was putting out a \\"vintage jazz/soul\\" disc I was extremely excited because I knew she could pull it off. However, the final product is so over the top I can't even stand it. For someone who is a huge fan of old jazz records I found this disc to be nothing but overproduced pop with only a slight influence of classic jazz/soul. She basically took multiple elements from different eras (too many eras in my opinion) and created a new sound. I do give her credit for the effort, though. The only song I really liked was \\"Trouble\\" because it sounds the most like an old jazz record. Everything else is too slick and just plain overdone. I wish Christina would have taken a bigger risk and made a real jazz/soul disc. That being said, her voice is so powerful I had to give this disc 3 stars. If anything, buy this disc for that alone and you will not be disappointed.

B000FGGE68|5.0|Judging from many of the decidedly uncomplimentary remarks found here and elsewhere, some of these reviewers may have been born into a world difficult to understand. For the inconsequential price of admission, Ultraviolet launches us on a voyage through a visually and aurally exciting future fantasy world created very possibly to showcase the essence of an extremely lovely and vivacious young woman, Milla Natasha Jovovich. In this incarnation as Violet, a hemophage in the late 21st century, and placed upon a path of discovery and rebirth, she passes before our eyes and ears with the spectacular splendor of the full color spectrum. We are sometimes lulled and more often enlivened by the sensuous and sultry sound of her voice, mesmerized and transfixed by the resolute regard of her eyes, her mouth, and her face, and alerted and attracted to her youthful grace, lithe figure, and confident posture. All else, the amazing martial arts, the exceptional motorcycle stunts, the thoroughly surprising architectural elements of Shanghai, China, and the ever more alluring sequence of lush costumes and lavish sets, is backdrop, though beautifully choreographed, vibrantly hued, and fascinatingly textured. Whoa! It is reassuring to know such a creature as Milla inhabits our planet.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Ya, I'm a 22 yr old HETEROSEXUAL male, and I bought the 10 Yr Season Series of Frieds.  I've had the box set for a month and I'm half way done with Season 9.  It's strange how much I wasn't THAT into Friends when it was on the air, but now I can't get enough of them.  Though Friends cracks me up, episode after episode, it's not really the humor that I find drawing to the show, it's the love that the characters have towards each other.  You know each character's history that it feels that you actually know them personally.  Idk, maybe I'm just a freak, but this show had something special to it, and I HIGHLY recomend it....

I'm ordering a set for my daughter now.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|I read quite a few of the other reviews before deciding to write my own. Most of them go on about the beautiful symbolism and eccentricity. Some love the depiction of the dysfunctional family. Others simply pan it outright.    As for my review, I loved all of the acting performances (Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell are two of my favorites), but I did not care for this movie. I would liken it to a group of great musicians playing a song that I just don't like. One reviewer said, \\"If you liked `American Beauty', you'll love `Little Miss Sunshine'.\\" I would agree. I'd also add \\"The Piano\\" to that list. I didn't like either of those films. I did, however, really enjoy \\"Sideways\\" - another film noir comparison made by another reviewer. Maybe it's the dysfunction that I don't get. Maybe growing up in a relatively normal and loving home disqualifies me from empathazing with a tale like this. If that's the case, then I do sincerely feel for those touched by this movie. To me it was over the top.
B000002LAB|5.0|This album by a great master was panned by the critics but it is a masterpiece. On it, Davis shows he can use his trumpet to paint in a  different style and this is his Picasso, his modern art work.  <br /> <br />And perhaps this is why the critics at the time didn't value this work appropriately. They were used to Davis using softer brush strokes to paint impressionistic pictures in their mind and didn't know what to make of the electric guitar and synthesizer that pushed him into a new genre. <br /> <br />Listening to some of the tracks, you can see the paint splat against the canvas and Davis working fevorishly but deliberately like a musical Jackson Pollack. <br /> <br />I highly suggest they and you listen again and this time with open ears.
0399226907|5.0|my two year old twins really like this book.  They went through a phase right around when they turned two when they really loved it.

1416509798|4.0|This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery. Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.<br /><br />When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a \\"woman in white,\\" a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother. The \\"woman in white\\" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum. Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration. Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.<br /><br />The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view. The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business. Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake. A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.<br /><br />The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior. The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot. As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel. The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently. The almost-forgotten author of twenty-five novels, Collins was one of the most successful authors of Victorian mysteries, and he is gaining new attention as a result of reprints of this novel and The Moonstone.

B00005JPLU|4.0|Director Zack Snyder's \\"300\\" is all about flesh and the blood spilled from said flesh: the buffed out leather Speedo-wearing, militaristic war mongers called the Spartans lead by King Leonidas ( a remarkably lean and muscled, macho heretofore \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" Gerard Butler), his refreshing and politically astute and physically empowered wife Gorgo (the splendid Lena Headley who has no problem running a man through with a spear) and the demi-god in his own mind Persian leader Xerxes (a bejeweled, manically pierced from stem to stern, penciled in eyebrowed, Rodrigo Santoro) and his various and sundry (as in Africans, Asians, Turks, and a strange and motley crew of blood thirsty hump-backed Gnomes) army of hundreds of thousands.<br /><br />There is also plenty of blood: heads lopped off, spears through the stomach and the eye, horses cut down, elephants stopped dead in their tracks, wholesale demolition of thousands by way of hand to hand combat.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is violent and brutal of course in its imagining of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae between an army of 300 Spartans and many thousands of Persians in 480 B.C., but director Zack Snyder (director of the recent, pretty good remake of \\"The Dawn of the Dead\\") has made it stylized and operatic both in tone and in its physical production: the color is muted thereby rendering the blood and the wall-to-wall special effects and violence unreal and other-worldly which harkens back to the Graphic Novel genesis of this material. Even the sex, what little there is, is stylized and synthetic: the sexual montage between Leonidas and Gorgo, though graphic in its nudity lacks the sensuousness necessary to make it effective.<br /><br />With all of this said though ,\\"300\\" has a very visceral, gut-wrenching impact through the accumulation of gorgeous images and the unrelenting impact of men fighting for a cause and caring nothing of the consequences to themselves. \\"300\\" is after all a film about the Spartans: soldiers groomed from childhood for the battlefield. In 2007, this might seem quaint, antiquated and frankly gonzo but, despite all the artifice, Snyder and his actors have nonetheless made all of this fierce, noble and hysterically cogent for our less than courageous and decisive times.dhood for the battlefield.

0790729725|5.0|THis is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  While it makes much of the violence seem funny and natural, the overall impact of the film is to show how empty and dangerous the mob life really was.  I have watched this at least 15 times, and have enjoyed it every single time as more detail comes through.  The characters are extremely subtle and the acting is absolutely first rate.  You get a historical snapshop of organizaed crime as well as a cautionary tale:  the dreamlike quality of \\"the life\\" gives way to the ugliest of realities.  While certain of the characters are composites, such as Tommy, the story is essentially true.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|United States Championship  John Cena Vs. Big Show - This is actually a good opening bout. Cena did a good job getting the crowd pumped with his pre-match rap. Big Show and Cena put in a good effort and they produce a good match for the U.S. Title. Everything an opening match is suppose to do, Big Show and Cena did it. Good match from Cena and Big Show. 3.5/5    World Tag Team Championship  Booker T & Rob Van Dam Vs. La Resistance Vs. Lance Cade & Mark Jindrake Vs. Dudley Boyz - The first weaker matches of the night. The match was average but it really didn't deliver. The match didn't really flow and it was really boring all the way through. 2.5/5    Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - This is the sleeper match of the night. Jericho and Christian brought their A game and they delivered one heck of a wrestling match. This was a solid back and forth contest and very entertaining. The post-match heel turn of Trish added more flavor to match as well. Great match. 4.5/5    The Rock & Mick Foley Vs. Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton, Ric Flair, & Batista - This was another good contest too. The Rock looked to be on his game for not wrestling in a PPV since Backlash of last year. All five men gave in a good effort and they produced a very entertaining match. A very good match for what it's worth. 4/5    Playboy Evening Gown Match  Sable & Torrie Wilson Vs. Stacy Keiber & Miss Jackie - The T&A portion of the night and thats all this match provided. Nothing besides that takes place here. 1.5/5    Curiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship  Nothing really special here. I few nice spots with the cruiserweights but nothing that really stands out. However, Billy Kidman pulled off a nice looking Shooting Star Press to Jamie Noble and Nunzio. The pin falls and the decisions came too quick and they all didn't look that believeable. A decent match at best. 3/5    Bill Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar - This is the most disappointing match of the night mostly because of what thesetwo men can bring to the table and after the great build up to the match but Goldberg and Lesnar did absolutely nothing. Not even Stone Cold Steve Austin being the special guest referee could have saved this trainwreck. Where this should have been possibably the best match on card, Goldberg and Lesnar mostly stalled and produced one of the worst matches ever. The fans gave this match so much heat all the way through its duration to where Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler gave explaination on why the fans gave Goldberg and Lesnar so much heat. Without of a doubt the worst match of the night. Austin stunning Goldberg and Lesnar after the match was the only highlight. 2/5    WWE Tag Team Championship  Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty Vs. World's Greatest Tag Team Vs. A.P.A. Vs. Basham Brothers - This match follows the same deal as Raw's Tag Team Title Match. Nothing really sticks out and this match was just average at best. The only positives came from this match was that it boosted Shelton Benjamin's and J.B.L.'s single career. 2.5/5    Hair Match for the WWE Women's Championship  Victoria Vs. Molly Holly - A pretty above average Women's Title Match. The Hair stipulation did more good for the match then bad. Victoria and Molly delivered a nice match up and this match is quite enjoyable. 3/5    WWE Championship  Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt Angle - This match is pretty much dead even. Angle and Eddie delivered a well paced mat game, back and forth, technical match. Nothing really bad to say about this one. It was just good from start to finish. Eddie's clever ending was dirty but played out perfectly. This is a match that you just have to appreciate the effort and determination both men put int he match to have the best match of the night. A very good WWE Title match. 4.5/5    Undertaker Vs. Kane - Undertaker probably had the most loudest pop of the night here. His entrance was one of a kind along with Paul Bearer back on his side. This match isn't on the same level as their first meetingbut it is still worth a watch and is quite enjoyable. Undertaker has a nice return match here and it did everything what it was suppose to do. I give credit to Kane also. He made Undertaker's return to being the \\"Deadman\\" more believeable and realistic then what it was. A very good showing from both men. 3.5/5    World Heavyweight Championship  Triple H Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels - Without of a doubt, this match was one of the greatest WrestleMania matches of all time. This match makes this PPV worth seeing. All three men has a great showing and they all delivered a fantastic main event, something that this event needed. HBK and HHH teaming up to double suplex Benoit through the announce table is something worth seeing. The closing moments to the match is something to see as well as it ends with Chris Benoit countering Triple H's Pedigree into the Crippler Crossface. Awesome main event that delivered all the way. 5/5    The 20th Anniversary of WrestleMania is a disappointing one to say the least. Less then half of the PPV delivered which was pretty pathetic for WWE's biggest PPV of all time. This is PPV is only average at best. I recommend it for the awesome main event and Undertaker's return. Other then that this event is passable unless you can find it somewhere cheap.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Having watched this last year in the UK I have been waiting for the HD DVD release for some time. I was disappointed that the US tv release - for whatever reason - was altered by editing and changing the running order as well as replacing the excellent narration by Sir David Attenborough with Sigourney Weaver. I had heard that the DVD release would correct this and it would be restored to the correct order and full content as well as the original narration. this seams to be the case for the regular DVD set but by the looks of it the high definition is not. I hope that this is a printing error and that viewers here in the US will be able to (finally) see the whole series as it was intended to be viewed.    ** Edit ** I understand that this may indeed be a printing error and all DVD releases will be the original BBC presentation - DVD, Blu-Ray & HD-DVD

032147404X|5.0|Despite what some have called humor they could do without, I do appreciate the fact that Mr. Kelby tried to include some of his personality in his book.  Instead of just spewing out facts and how-to-get-the-shot you want info, Scott infuses a little of his sense of humor while passing on his knowledge.  He does a great job of giving you the information you are looking for in order to take your photography to the next level.  There are beautiful examples of photographs and clear instructions on how to accomplish getting the same quality shots on your own.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and refer back to it often.  I also like how he covered not just how to get a particular shot, but he also includes tips on equipment and post production. <br />  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone getting into digital photography and especially those who are getting into digital SLRs and want to take their photography to a professional level.  Even if you don't want to be a professional, but just want to take professional looking photos, this book is for you.
0553381687|5.0|As you may have guessed I'm a big fan. Fascinating characters whose stories move along by themselves then interweave perfectly with others. It all seems very believable too. Maybe bacause there's very little out and out magic which sometimes is too easy a way to get characters out of trouble or move a plot along.<br /><br />I actually read books 2,3 & 4 of the series first and now I'm half way thrugh this one. Don't recommend this approach but I knew I was on to something when I really enjoyed the first half of book 2 while struggling to figure out exactly who was who and had done what in the past.<br /><br />I thought the Sword of Truth books were great but this is better. And as a final bonus - the series is thousands of pages long.<br /><br />Write a massive series of books with fantastic characters and a rivetting plot....brilliant!

B00005Q45W|5.0|This was Leonard Cohen's first album in 9 years after a stay in a Zen monastery.  It feels like he's never been away.  This is another great work by Mr. Cohen, sad, depressing, uplifiting, haunting, and moving.  Some have complained about the spare instrumentation (mostly a synclavier/computer performed by Sharon Robinson, who co-wrote all the songs here with Leonard), but I think it works very well.  It's simple and straightforward, and it really enhances the sad, Scotch drenched lyrics.  A Thousand Kisses Deep is my favorite here, along with Alexandra Leaving (a great title to a great song), and By the Rivers Dark.  This isn't my favorite Cohen album (that's The Future), but this is probably the 2nd most played album in my Cohen collection.  I hope that Mr. Cohen doesn't go away for 9 years again.  Everyone missed him.  But it's amazing that despite the fact he was gone for so long, he didn't miss a beat.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|After Friends, I never found a comedy that is even close to Friends, I watched Everybody loves Raymond or Seinfeld on TBS but they were ok, but I could never become addicted to those shows. <br />    However after I saw this show, only 10 minutes was enough for me to start lauhing like crazy. Barney is amazing, he is one of the best characters I have seen on TV. He is unpredictable, crazy and extremely funny. I will not summarize the show for you guys, since a lot of people already did, but I can easily say that if you liked Friends, you will love this show very much. Just like in Friends, there is love, friendship, heartbreaks, breakups - ups and downs happening in a very funny setting. Must have it!!!

As an Ordained Minister, and successful business woman myself, I can tell you this book delivers a wonderful gift. I myself, have been useing the Secret for many years. I was reminded of it from within myself, but, it mirrors what this book teachers, it reminds the reader, that you , each and every one of you, has the power to create your/our lives - even our World a New!

B0000A0DRY|2.0|Funny thing, time. As I remembered this album, it was really extra cool when it was first released; listening to it now on my recently purchased CD, it's simply alright. 'Guess \\"Feeding Your Head,\\" as Grace said, is still compulsory with listening to it now. Oh well. I suppose Alice still knows? <br /> <br />A couple classic cuts makes it worth the sale price.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Wonderful, powerful voices and a beautifully written score. The first time this concert played in our house, the entire family (including our portable-electronics-addicted 10yr old son who thinks Green Day is the ultimate musical experience) trickled into the family room one by one and sat down--and stayed put without so much as a bathroom break for the entire duration. Whern it finished, we played it again. And again the next day. No kidding. This is powerful, lovely stuff that will move you, regardless of your heritage or ancestry. Of course, if you're Irish (as I am; 1/4 anyway), it will pluck at your heartstrings, but even if not I promise you will love it. Worth every penny many, many times over.
0743201140|3.0|The book is pretty good.  It has some information in it that could be really helpful to a person who is just coming into a leadership position.  However, there is a test that it recommends the reader take online using a number code in the book.  The test is accurate and provides great insight, but it can only be used once, which means that if an owner before you has taken the test using that code, you can't take it yourself.  Furthermore, the website doesn't give you the full results of your personality test.  To get them, you have to pay about $500 more.  If it is a new copy or you know that the previous owner has not taken the test, then it is a good buy.
B0001KU93C|5.0|Django is a fantastic film. It's one of the best Spaghetti Westerns out there. The Anchor Bay edition which is out of print is ok as far as the picture goes but the sad thing is the only language track is the dubbed English which is more funny than anything. You need the Blue Underground edition. The picture is fantastic except for a few blemishes. It also has the Italian audio track which to me makes for a far better film. Django is surreal which makes for a good time with the DVD player. Highly recommended.

B00005JPLU|4.0|In \\"300,\\" director Zack Snyder's hyperkinetic, adrenaline-fueled and über-macho adaptation of Frank Millar's hyperkinetic, adrenaline-fueled and über-macho graphic novel, subtlety was left by the wayside.  This a film that attempted to embody the bravura of pure cinema, and it got close.  The film, narrated by Spartan warrior Delios (David Wenham in full throat), followed the exploits of the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, buffed-up and battle ready) who led 300 of his finest warriors, along with perhaps 1000 fellow Greeks against the fearsome and massive armies of the Persian Emperor Xerxes (Roderigo Santuro, decked out in lots of opulent gold).  Politics and arcane law kept more from making the trek, but they almost did not need to.  The Spartan forces kept the hundreds of thousand of Persians at bay, using a narrow canyon near the Greek coast called the Hot Gates, where the vast numbers of Persians could be neutralized.   <br /> <br />But don't expect Snyder to give you a history lesson.  The back-story is brief and only a sketch, providing just enough time for establishing the blustery and defiant Spartan culture (which is done quite well) and for Leonidas to royally tick off Xerxes and give his wife (a fiery Lena Headey) a final send-off.  The film springs to bloody life at the Hot Gates, where the fabled 300 make their stand.  Drenched in the vibrant visual style of \\"Sin City,\\" Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's battle scenes synthesize their style from a variety of sources, such the ferocious close combat sword jangling found in the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and the blood-splatter and gore of \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Braveheart.\\"  But they add their own innovative wrinkle as well, aggressively pulling the camera back on ground level to take in the jarring effect of sword and spear meeting flesh.  The sight of a roaring Leonidas and his soldiers attacking and holding their ground against the swarm of Persian armies is riveting, given context because Snyder and his screenwriters Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon made sure to flesh out the Spartan ethos of defiance to the last breath.  Throughout the film, they draw you in to this dramatized, and more than likely fanciful, Spartan culture, one that is fierce and fraternal.  It's enthralling, if not exactly historic.  If it is a purely exciting and engrossing cinematic experience you are looking for, look not further then \\"300.\\"  You will not be disappointed.
073510073X|1.0|Bunkum by a master grifter. Poorly written <br />(not even entertaining as con artists can be: <br />carnival sideshows!) and edited as well (two <br />of scores of insensitive errors: folk is <br />plural, not folks; adage is an axiom, old <br />adage is wordy). Why with all the money Aron <br />is making off her HSP industry, next we'll <br />learn that she has duped the most famous <br />zoologists from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe to <br />assert with her that HSPs evolved from <br />peaceful and loving (and hidden!) bonobos, <br />orangutans, and gorillas and that the rest of <br />us did from out there, gang-warfaring chimps. <br />I qualify nearly 100% as an HSP, and I would <br />buy that book and believe in it with all my <br />heart and soul! And I'd spend the rest of my <br />life as a bonobo hoping to do what <br />they--surely earth's only true saints--do <br />most of their time. Facing prudish scorn, <br />I would proclaim: I am an HSP; I am special; <br />leave me alone, clods! <br />
B00049QQHI|1.0|Bad, bad, bad. <br />Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. <br />I was sort of neutral about DiCaprio until I saw this steaming pile of bad acting. Consequently, since seeing this, I haven't voluntarily watched another DiCaprio performance. <br />It was a huge mistake by the director (or the screen writer) to NOT set this in the era in which Jim Carroll grew up. Or if it was meant to be, it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms.
B000000OXH|5.0|I had this DVD before only lost it due to a B&E. It's great to have the music back again. I listen to it almost constantly. I'll probably wear it out. What can I say? I like most of Asia's music.
B00005JLKB|4.0|A very nice series about young superman. The characters and the locations are very enjoyable.
B00005JPLU|1.0|I guess \\"meaningless\\" wouldn't exactly be accurate; there's meaning in the story. It's just that what meaning there is in 300 has so little value. <br /> <br />My friends and I who went to see this really ended up laughing through most of this film. Sure, it was pretty. But that was about all there was to it. Everything in the story was just so trite, and there's not a character in the film that's not a stereotype. Plus, there's no plot. The Persians are coming, and the whole movie is just the Spartans battling wave upon wave of the different kinds of warriors that can be thrown at them. The repetitive battle scenes are only broken up by a couple of gratuitous sex scenes and speech after speech after speech (six or seven) that all say the same thing--the Spartans are the reasonable people in the world, fighting for freedom and justice. They even got a Mel Gibson look- and sound-alike, and they had him give a couple of Braveheart speeches (though I liked that movie, which made a little bit of sense). <br /> <br />Of course, there's not a whole lot about the Spartan society in the movie that makes it seem so free or reasonable. Infants with the slightest imperfection are thrown to their deaths. Boys are ripped from their mothers and drafted into a violent warrior culture where, it is made clear, concepts of love and mercy are anathema. If these boys don't survive their childhood, they don't deserve to live anyway. The \\"philosophers\\" and \\"boy lovers\\" of Athens are mocked, and it's made clear that Spartan society is socially and economically unjust. They even kill the defenseless enemy messengers in one of the opening scenes of the film. Also, King Leonidas's wife tells him the standard Spartan line, \\"Either come back with your shield or on top of it.\\" Many of these things, I'm sure, are pretty accurate concerning Spartan society. But this isn't a free or reasonable society. It's ridiculous that the movie pretends so. <br /> <br />Honestly, there's not a value in the movie that I could agree with. It's really out to appeal to peoples' worst instincts. The film is at its heart about violence for violence's sake, and the concepts of \\"liberty\\" and \\"justice\\" and \\"duty\\" are only cheapened by being in it. <br /> <br />A common definition of pornography: \\"creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.) of no literary or artistic value other than to stimulate desire.\\" Frankly, 300 comes pretty close to this.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is just one of the greatest series ever! I absolutely love it, It's funny and witty, very entertaining!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I've yet to run into another series with a first season so well-developed. The dialogue is fun and natural, the plots have frequent twists, and there are a number of inside references that are funny if you catch them, but I don't think would detract from the show if you don't. My only complaint is the default suggestion to salt and burn the remains to banish a ghost... but since it doesn't always work in the show, it's a minor bugagboo.<br /><br />I grew up reading every ghost story I could get from the library... and this show STILL creeps me out on occasion. If you like a good spook story, this show is for you.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This movie has very little in common with the real story.  I disliked it very much and would not recommend it to anyone! I originally bought it to show to my classes after we finished reading Beowulf.  I reviewed this movie and could barely finish watching it--it was sooooo bad.  Needless to say, I never showed this movie to my classes.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|Musically this may be Neal's best (although Stranger in Your Soul from Bridge Across Forever is his best song, in my opinion). The tone is darker. Nice change since so many of his previous albums sound similar in tone. Great guitar shredding by Paul Gilbert! <br />This is an in-your-face message. What courage it takes to write about this! No aliens, astrology, and demonic overtones which are so prevalent in alot of prog. You who are complaining, would you be more happy if he made a sickeningly sweet Christian pop/prog CD like the rest of the CCM industry?  <br /> <br />Neal said that this was inspired by a teaching by his pastor. Some of the lyrics are just hilarious and reflect Neal's strange sense of humor. In my opinion, the use of \\"whore\\" and \\"Beast\\" is a little strong, however. There is a point where casting pearls before swine is not a good idea. And considering that most Americans and others have no concept of history or theology, it makes it difficult. I am not sure if this is dispensational theology that had the Catholic Church as the Beast of Revelation. Most people who preached that have changed their minds in recent years. I can see how he could think that the Catholic Church at the time of Luther should have known better, therefore implying deceptive intent. But this was more likely due to political power (\\"look I've got great armies like a General\\") rather than being demonically inspired. <br />Overall, a great album. I recommend it. It is great to see a musician truly channeling the muse rather than just going with formula!
B000GFLEJA|5.0|Don't worry about the content if you know the movie is a hilarious drug-induced adventure in insanity, and Las Vegas.  Instead, don't buy the HD DVD version unless you have an HD DVD player.  This product does not play on a regular DVD player.  I had to return my first order and reorder the DVD version.  This movie is difficult to find in the movie store, at least in my neck of the woods; so ordering it from Amazon was a logical decision.  Fortunately, the customer service reps handled the issue, refunding all of my money.  Don't make the same mistake I did -it takes a long time to go through the return/refund process.
B00005JPLU|4.0|300 is a movie based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller published by Dark Horse comics in 1998.  The movie details the battle of Thermopile, 300 Spartan solders vs the million plus of the Persian army.  Some of you might be aware of the actual story of this battle that the facts of has been disputed for countless years.  Many of the facts, namely the number of Persian solders and the number of Greek solders from other cities, are widely disputed by history scholars.  The one fact that cannot be disputed is that there were only 300 Spartan warriors and they were heavily out number, conservatively 100 to 1, and that they absolutely punished the Persians and brutally slain so many that all would know, till the end of time, that the 300 Spartans were some of the fierce, highly skilled and battle savvy warriors ever to walk this earth.<br /><br />Put your history book down because this movie is not trying to be historic fact.  This a historic battle depicted as a comic book with Hollywood moxy and juiced with testosterone and a shot of pure adrenaline. This version of the story is balls out, unapologetically graphic, gratuitous, and brutal.  This CG stylized action flick is full of with quick witted dialog and epic battle scenes that will please the carnal beast hidden in every man, (and some women.)<br /><br />One of the things that was surprising to me was the acting in it is quite good.  It has it's heart felt moments that added depth and emotion to the story without being sappy or heavy handed.  The dialog was very true to the original graphic novel as well as many shots in the movie were pulled right from Frank Miller's comic page.  This movie honors the spirit of Miller's book much like Sin City did, and is a true testament to the respect that Frank Miller is given to his master works from Hollywood Producers and Directors.<br /><br />This Movie was directed by Zach Snyder, director of the Dawn of the Dead remake a few years back. Zach showed great skill and pulled out all the stops and new tricks in digital film making.  The look of the movie was vivacious, visceral and visually appetizing, much like the graphic novel.  The battle scenes were heavy in the CG and noticeably so, but not to the detriment of the movie because it fit with the heightened sense and surreal feeling this movie is shooting for.  This movie has heart,a pumping blood soaked heart that makes one long for the days that you could swing an axe into someone's face.<br /><br />This movie could have been a disaster and very well could have turned into a sappy male bonding, homo erotic \\"I love you man\\" type movie but no!  It's tough, gritty and raw till the bitter, blood soaked end.  Never to shed a pussiefied tear or besmirch the legacy of great warriors with unwarrented<br />sentimental drivel.  This film is more like Lord of the Rings than Braveheart, so make sure you know what your about to watch.  A couple of the dudes setting next to me commented on some of the exaggerated characters that look more like creatures than people, not realizing it was done for dramatic effect and cinematic splendor.<br /><br /> I only recognized one person in this entire movie and that was David Wenham, who played Faramir in Lord of the Rings.  King Leonidas is played by Gerard Butler (who played opposite Christian Bale and Mathew McConaughey in 2002's Reign of Fire) now proved that not only can he hold the screen in a leading role but he can do it with intensity and charisma.  He transformed himself into this character for this role and knows when to play it soft or blow your pansy little socks off by roaring \\"This... is... Sparta!\\".  I can't say enough about his performance and look forward to seeing more of him in the future.  The other notable performances were by the Queen of Sparta played by the ravishing Lena Headey.  Her performance really gave the movie some true thespian legitimacy.<br /><br />The other members of the supporting cast holds up and add many dynamic characters and personalities to the movie. This movie hold up as one of the best of the early films of 2007. It's one of those movies that is just a blast to see on the big screen and just escape into.  It's not the best movie of this type of genre but it's close. All in all it's a very strong film that I must go see a second time.ovie hold up as one of the best of the early films of 2007.

B00005JPLU|5.0|Ah, to be male in Ancient Greece: \\"300\\" is a testosterone-driven fantasy in which all men are fearless warriors, driven by the need for battle and bloodshed. War is depicted as gloriously as any geek loner-type could hope for, with every soldier being the epitome of strength, courage, and physical brute force. Emotional bonding, sensitivity, and compassion don't even come into play; these men were trained to be ruthless killing machines, all in the name of preserving the glory of Sparta. This would no doubt be a ridiculous film if the story were presented in a straightforward, mainstream way. But straightforward and mainstream, \\"300\\" is not; this is pure, hard-driving escapism, from the frenetic battle sequences to the elaborate special effects to the over the top performances. In this sense, it's absolutely brilliant.    And it gets even better. Every shot, every setting, and every event is accentuated by a look so stylized that it's practically a living duplicate of Frank Miller's original graphic novel. This was achieved through computer-generated imagery, which was responsible for creating most of the film's locations. Bluescreen technology--also utilized for another incredible Miller adaptation, 2005's \\"Sin City\\"--made for a majority of the sets, leaving very little for the actors to actually work with. I can only imagine the effort that went into post-production, the endless hours of crafting landscapes, characters, and special effects all with the click of a mouse. The work paid off; the end product is an effectively heightened reinterpretation of reality, a kind of living illustration that transcends any sense of time or place. It's the perfect look for war story of this caliber, something so grandiose and overplayed that you can't get enough.    The plot is fairly simple: it's a retelling of the 480 BC Battle of Thermopylae, in which the Spartans fought against the Persians. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his army of a mere 300 soldiers are ready to defend their land against the evil King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). This is despite the fact that 1) they don't have the blessing of the gods to go to war, and 2) they will fight against an army of over one million. But this matters not; Spartan males are trained to be warriors at a very early age, essentially the day that they're born (only the largest, strongest newborns are spared; the small, sickly ones are unceremoniously thrown off of a cliff). They are taught the fine art of combat. They are made to take all kinds of physical pain, including lashings. They are conditioned to never retreat, even when facing insurmountable odds. Leonidas successfully survived such rigorous training (his first major battle was against a monstrous wolf with glowing eyes), as did the rest of his men. Now, they are ready for battle.    And after taking position near a beachfront cliff, the Spartans engage in ferocious battle with the Persians. Never on film has war been so much fun to watch. This is probably because each sequence was beautifully photographed; even graphic shots of stabbings, amputations, and decapitations are so artfully constructed that it's hard to accept them as deplorable. The bodies of Persian soldiers are used to construct a blockade of surprising strength. Blood spatters from gaping wounds in dark, unrealistic globules, effectively looking more like spots of ink. There's a moment when arrows fly through the air in numbers so vast, they block the light of the sun. Nearly every shot is drawn out, often going in slow motion to show how carefully choreographed the gratuitous violence is.     The Spartans also fight against the Immortals, an army of ghastly yet fantastical creatures with an appetite for destruction. They were appropriately crafted as one-dimensional barbarians, made more effective because of their appearances; they wear long black robes, and their pale, monstrous faces are hidden behind Tragedy-style silver masks. Where they came from is anyone's guess. I suppose it doesn't really matter, especially since they pave the way for a number of other ghoulish creatures that would give the creations of Clive Barker a run for their money. They--and every aspect of the film, for that matter--make it obvious that the real emphasis is on style instead of story, which under different circumstances would make for a miserable experience. But in this case, it works quite well; while a definite story is being told, it would be of little significance were it not for the special effects.    This isn't to say that the story of \\"300\\" is bad. Quite the opposite: despite being simplistic, the story is quite strong, especially when a couple of subplots are factored in. Back in Sparta, Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), is up against a corrupt Senate, already bought out by the Persians in order to ensure Sparta's stability. The arrogant and treacherous Theron (Dominic West) is clearly not ready to handle a woman of such strength, especially since she fully supports Leonidas and Sparta's involvement in the war. Because she intends to plead to the Council for the deployment of more soldiers, Theron challenges her authority by exclaiming that her words will fall on deaf ears.    Another subplot involves Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), a hunchbacked, hideously deformed Spartan who begs to join with Leonidas and fight against the Persians. Leonidas appreciates his passion, but refuses to let him fight; he's unable to lift his shield, and this would only create a weak spot in their defense system. Feeling rejected, Ephialtes personally appeals to Xerxes, who promises a wealth of power, money, and pleasure in exchange for loyalty. This scene takes place in Xerxes' den, in which a throng of misshapen creatures engages in an orgy. Before \\"300,\\" I never would have believed that any film could include such a scene, or at least a scene that would work in any way, shape, or form. I was wrong; it was a fascinating scene, forcing the viewer to reassess what is beautiful and what is ugly.    The film is narrated by Dilios (David Wenham), a Spartan soldier with a hard-edged masculinity that shines through despite a deceptively soft voice. He recalls Leonidas, Sparta, and the Battle of Thermopylae with eloquence; when considering the heavy-handedness of war, this is no small task. Yet he always gives a perfect delivery, and that only strengthens the appeal of \\"300.\\" This is in a world all its own, a world dominated by battle cries, sword fights, and bare-chested men that are ripped like bodybuilders. It's all thanks to Frank Miller, whose creative vision has allowed for a truly unique theatrical experience. If he creates another graphic novel, I can't wait for it to be adapted for the big screen.

B000A6T1JU|3.0|michael pare was great. you see how one persons opinion of others can be totally wrong and stereotype people. it does have violence and language but is pertinent to the telling of this story.
B000LC55F2|4.0|I am kind of sorry I did not see this in the theatre after just catching it on dvd. The Prestige is what I might call an intelligent popcorn flick and was certainly worth the big screen experience. The story has several layers playing against each other in a constant match of dangerous oneupmanship as 2 men who are obsessed with illusion have their ultimate fates decided by their inability to let go. The timeline, similarly to Nolan's Memento, was used to great effect to reveal the entire story at a nice pace with more impact. The mystery was well done, but not too shocking when revealed because you could figure it out right before they popped it on you, but only because all of the clues were there if you payed attention. One of the strong parts of the movie is that it doesn't really pull any punches in this manner. Some might argue that the Tesla part of the story does, but I really like that little dash of real magic it added and how it showed the lengths at which these men would go to outdo the other. On top of that, the historical implications of the science make it fun to wonder. In the end, The Prestige, while being incredibly dark and sinister in many ways, was a blast and what I wish more popcorn flicks could be like.

0966638328|5.0|Let's start by saying that I've been a Graphic and Multimedia Designer for over 10 years now. Like all beginners I used to think that design was all about what ever you liked best.<br /><br />Well thats worth a good chuckle these days. As an experienced designer will tell you there's a lot more to good design than personal preference.<br /><br />Matter of fact it's more like a science than anything else. Once you start diving into color theory and color association you begin to realize that there's quite a lot of information to retain and that there's a right and a wrong color for everything.<br /><br />Well here's your reference guide!<br /><br />This book has sat on my desk for the 4+ years that I've owned it and has definitely seen better days. The pages are falling out, the cover is beat ta heck and page 63 in particular has been scanned so that I could fold it up and put it in my pocket more times then I can count.<br /><br />Leatrice keeps her explanations simple and direct and reinforces them with stellar designs of well known products from top notch agencies.<br /><br />She adds a large section of color palettes in the middle but they've become a bit dated since the release of this book. Some of them are still nice and will at least inspire you to play with some similar colors.<br /><br />As an added bonus the back of the book has the CMYK values for all of the pantones if you're one of the cave dwellers that dont have a Pantone booklet (shame on you!).<br /><br />This is not the definitive color theory hand book!<br /><br />You wont become a master after reading this and there are quite a few design fundamentals that are not included.<br /><br />But it is a terrific and beautiful reference that you'll find yourself digging through constantly for information and inspiration.<br /><br />It belongs on your bookshelf.<br /><br />Nuff said.
B00081912E|5.0|This was the movie that made me love Jim Carrey. What an excellent use of his physical comedic abilities. The story line is very simple: Stanley Ipkiss aka Mr Nice Guy gains almost unlimited confidence when he puts on a strange mask he discovered in a river one night. The Mask, the character he transforms into is able to change shape, size, create things from nothing and blends the sublime from slapstick cartoons with real live action scenes. This was the 2nd hit movie after the breakthrough Ace Ventura role in the same year.<br /><br />Some people may or may not know but this was also the film in which Cameron Diaz made her feature film debut. She has never looked better since. Even in the two Charlie's Angels film she does not look as good as this. And the open sequence where she is introduced must be one of those rare moments in cinematic history with a great use of the camera.<br /><br />Overall this is a hilarious farce from beginning to end. Jim Carrey is absolutely brilliant in both characters, the meek and mild Stanley Ipkiss, and the wild and crazy Mask. I think we all wish that we could sometimes embrace a wilder side within ourselves because it allows us feel more alive. This is a classic in modern comedy and for anyone who's a Jim Carrey fan.<br /><br />This film produced a spin off cartoon series for a short while. The sad part is the sequel didn't feature Jim and I refused to watch it for that very reason.<br /><br />A final thought there is two dance sequences which stand out. And Jim does all his own dance moves in this film for which I think one must certainly applaud him.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|This was perhaps not the best Scorsese, but even average Scorsese is great. Suspense and acting and directing superb.  The plot was somewhat lame, and deriative, but what the heck, it keep me interested the whole way through, and meted out justice, a kind of happy ending, in a surprising and satisfying way.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I will not trouble to re-hash what so many other reviews rave about -- as I would only script redundancies, i.e., this is a true MASTERPIECE of cinematographic adaptation of a British literary classic. <br /> <br />I would, however, like to pay special homage to the endearing and lovely Ruth Wilson.  I'd never seen her in anything before this \\"Jane Eyre\\" and I was incredibly moved by her acting skill.  Miss Wilson takes the eponymous lead role and embodies it fully.  Her Jane is sensible, thoughtful, and constrained without being priggish, morose, or repressed.  I fell under her \\"Eyre\\"-ish spell completely.   <br /> <br />I also admired Toby Stevens' role as the brooding and tortured Edward Rochester.  Again, his portrayal was keenly executed, although I was not as mesmerized as I was by Ruth Wilson. <br /> <br />I reveled in partaking in every nanosecond of this film's 240-minute run time.  It was everything a Masterpiece Theatre literary adaptation to film promises:  a faithful (and, mercifully, non-literal) rendition of Charlotte Bronte's plot with skillfully-wrought acting, sumptuous photography, splendid costumes, and inspired music which magically takes the viewer into the very heart of Lowood School and Thornfield Hall -- and reluctant to leave it for the real world once the DVD concludes.
B000LC55F2|3.0|A suspenseful, surprising twisting plot that was sometimes too fantastical for its own good.  The other problem was the lack of a real hero.  A better movie than its twin, The Illusionist, it was not.  Still, it was worth seeing for Michael Caine's performance.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I really liked this film.  I mean, at first it seemed kind of lonely.  But of course, that's the point!  These two people, we certainly find out why, have a lot of issues with relationships and just being with people in general.  I know some people think Keanu Reeves is a very dry/flat actor but I think he did very well in this part.  He expressed passion, loneliness, frustration, compassion, etc. quite well!  Plus, I have to say, I love the song \\"I Can't Seem to Make You Mine\\" by the Clientele that opens the movie.<br /><br />Basically, this is a film about fate and waiting for the right time for things to happen.  I believe in that!  This movie, for all its time-traveling-letters thing really does a great job of showing how your know when something isn't right.  It illustrates patience in waiting for the right time for things to come along and gives us hope that if we stop trying to push and wait until the time comes when it feels right to do something, we will succeed!  Also, that you can't be fixed or helped unless you want to and you work actively to fix yourself!<br /><br />I really do recommend this movie.  I don't care if people are going to denegrate it by sayind \\"Oh, this is just another chick-flick!\\"  Don't underestimate the power of a good chick-flick!  They're not just for women you know!
032147404X|5.0|The book was written in a very down to earth way.  Scott shares some of his favorite settings so you can try the same settings on your camera.  He mentions several products in his book that are very good.  Scott has written this book in a very non-techinal way. I find myself refering back to the book all the time even when taking pictures.  I would recommend it to anyone that owns a digital camera.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban's \\"Awake\\" CD came home the week of its release.  He was my wife's favorite.  When we'd play the CD for her, it would usually bring tears to her eyes.  With the possible exception of John Denver, Groban was her favorite singer.  With her planetary exit, this CD becomes especially important for me in the way that music can mark important events in our lives.<br /><br />Groban's growth as a songwriter is the most innovative part of his third studio CD.  He co-wrote \\"Lullaby,\\" one of my three very favorites on the disc.  With Ladysmith Black Mambazo in the background this spare arrangement is gorgeous, \\"Through darkness, don't you ever stop believing; with love alone, with love you'll find your way, My love.\\"  What ambrosia!  \\"Weeping\\" that is also recorded with this same South African singing group is another jewel.  Groban's voice is exquisite, one of the most beautiful voices currently recording.  This song about overcoming fear is lovely.  \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" also repeats in the changer now with its lovely melody, the soaring arrangement and Josh's vocal pyrotechnics, \\"When you're lost inside I'll be there to find you.\\"<br /><br />The other songs on the CD are also consistently strong.  \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\" from Franco Zefferelli's 1968 classic film \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" and Groban's \\"Now Or Never\\" are both excellent.  \\"Awake\\" shows artistic growth from this exceptional musician.  Enjoy!
B0000024SN|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel were not just singers - they were incredibly talented poets who wrote words which touched your heart. Think of Shakespeare or Robert Frost put to music. You get not only the power of the words, but also the beauty fo the music.     With Sounds of Silence, you get numerous classics - The Sounds of Silence, I Am a Rock, Kathy's Song for three. You also get a collection of less well known but just as intricate tunes - Leaves that are Green, Blessed, Somewhere they Can't Find Me, Anji, Richard Cory, A Most Peculiar Man, April Come She Will, We've got a Groovey Thing Goin'.    Each song here has its own meaningful message. In I Am A Rock, they sing \\"I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved, I never would have cried.\\" Quite a different view from 'Tis better to have loved and lost'!    In The Sounds of Silence, they rail against people complacently accepting what they are told. \\"The people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made.\\" Written back in 1965, the words are just as meaningful in modern times.    Well recommended!
B000024D4R|5.0|TO TELL THE TRUTH... I DID'NT LISTEN TO THE ALBUM; I BOUGHT IT FOR MY POPS. CHICO(MY POPS), HE LOVES IT!!!
B0000032LS|5.0|I love the Rocky Horror Picture Show! Talk about a classic that shows off Tim Curry's vocal talents. Susan Sarandon is equally stunning in her role as a sweet, naive girl who grows a bit wild as the movie rolls on. <br /> <br />The basic premise of the movie is that it's a send-up of all the classic 1950s horror films, complete with a mad scientist creating his own monster, and the sweet innocent couple who bumble their way into this all. Toss in the wild 70s style free-love, space aliens, cross dressing and some truly classic lines, and you can see why this has become the favorite of many people. <br /> <br />Just about every song in here is one that you have great fun singing along with. The lyrics are great. The vocals are great. Tim Curry really has a fantastic voice that you have to hear to believe. You not only want to sing along with the songs, but get up and dance too! Then you have the sweet, harmonious songs too, the ones that really connect with your soul. <br /> <br />It definitely helps to see the movie a few times, to understand the great visuals that go along with the song - but once you've got that down, play the CD in your car, while you do your chores, or while you're getting work done! It makes the time fly by, and leaves you upbeat and enjoying life.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|After listening to Beatles songs forever in their original state, it is totally cool the hear some familiar songs broken apart and mixed up in new and exciting ways. Some songs with the same beat just flow into each other seamlessly. Other times tracks are mixed together from several songs to make something completely new. Brilliant!<br /><br />My biggest disappointment with Love is that too many songs are played unaltered. I like the Beatles but I have heard the originals until they are etched in my brain. Enough already!<br /><br />The other problem I have is the selection of songs. In general they didn't pick the best of the best. I have to believe that a big part of how they selected tunes was the visual potential in the Cirque de Soleil show, like Octopus's Garden...nobody's favorite song but great visual potential.<br /><br />I would welcome another mashup that was done with music foremost in mind without having to worry about the visualisation issues.<br /><br />I think I will remix a playlist from Love that has the new Mash-ups and eliminated the untouched tracks.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I think it is kind of black comedy. I don't feel special tention atmorphere when I watch a real spy or adventure movies. Although the main plot is description of two assassins, the movie ironically presents something really like real marriage in modern society. When a couple fights, they throws out everything including weapon, knife, ... Overall, I think it is quite funny and entertaining.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|This is one of the most boring top ten albums of all time. There is not one catch song in the bunch. The blandness may even be intentional. Like she is saying, \\"leave me alone!\\"<br /><br />I suspect Nora is uncomfortable in the intense media eye of celebrity. It must be like the unblinking eye of Mordor watching her every move. She just wants to be left alone to hang out in NYC with her pals and have fun in the clubs where she can jam in peace.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This is a deeply-moving story. The diplomat's wife went to investigate and collect evidence that profitable pharmaceuticals tested unsound drugs on HIV positive mothers or patients in Africa. As a result, she got herself murdered and her husband went to investigate his wife's cause of death and got the truth finally. The plot is very intriguing. We also understand Africa's culture further. It is very sad to see people there living a life like one or two centuries ago. In the end of the movie, the African musical song sounds full of sorrow. Overall, it is a worthy- watching movie which inspires our reflection toward many aspects. No wonder many people strongly recommend it.
074356619X|4.0|Well written and a great cast of speakers/writers.  The secret is the truth no matter what the naysayers say.  A grocery bagging clerk smirked and made a smartass comment to me when i bought a few copies for friends.  Told me it was all common sense and everyone knew the secret...yet she was miserable and making minimum wage and scowling!  RIIIGHHT...common sense.  Anyhow...great book, audio book and dvd..I have all 3
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I love this movie so much. I cannot think of any other actress who can play Lara Croft better than Angelina Jolie. She did most of the stunts personally without using the double. She is sexy and smart in the film. The plot is fast-paced and the visual effect is superb. We do not always have a movie whose main character is heroine these days. I think anyone who loves action and adventure films cannot miss this one.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|As one of those guys who has seen every Bond flick since Dr. No on opening day, I had my reservations about Craig and the concept of rebooting the Bond franchise.  My fears were unfounded.  This movie stands out as one of the best Bonds ever.  Keep an open mind and realize that Bond doesn't become \\"Bond. James Bond\\" until the last scene.  My only true disappointment was the title song and credit sequence.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|It's like reliving my adolescence. This film gives you that rush, as the series would. I started watching the series because I love Actor Heartthrob Wil Wheaton. To be honest, I bought this movie because he's in it. (He plays Wesly Crusher; the handsome, passionate, bright and kindhearted guy which shares those qualities with the actor.) This movie takes you away because of the richness of the soulful crew, the story development, the action, the computer aided strategies (with user-friendly interfaces), the really mean villains, the thrilling classical music, the passionate romances, the stimulating science jargon and the symphony of all those things put together. This movie has the elements that kept me hooked. I prefer this film to all other Star Trek Movies (Yes. Including the ones with Shatner & Nimoy.) Plus, this package comes with a second disk (I hope there's more of Wil in it.)
B00005JPLU|5.0|After some amazing trailers and about a years worth of hype I finally witnessed 300 this morning. It was about what I expected. Great action, gore, music, and a just total blast. Gerard Butler sheds The Phantom of the Opera mask and unleashes a powerhouse performance. Sure it didn't show that much range, but he made me believe he could beat the snot out of Maximus any day of the week. The film is visually beautiful to look at and should earn some Oscar nominations next year in the technical department. If you liked Gladiator and Sin City, you will love this movie, for it is roughly a combination of the two. I have just read it made 28 million dollars on friday alone. What a start for a hopefully long run at the box office.
074356619X|5.0|Tony Robbins has touched quite a bit on this idea but these cds go a bit deeper even though this \\"law of attraction\\" has been passed down from all the great thinkers a lifetime ago. Its a tough feat to accomplish but I have noticed my thoughts changing to a more positive outlook. I am able to get rid of self limiting beliefs as soon as I think of them and thats one of the biggest keys to the secret; controlling your thoughts. <br />Overall its very inspiring. I listen to it every time I get into my car. <br />If youre motivated to change, I believe that this will help. Its already began to work for me and Ive only been listening to it for a few days. <br />
0374105235|5.0|The writing of this story is quite an accomplishment for Ishmael Beah. To have lost so much, to have had so little, to have come so far and yet to have accomplished so much with what many in America take for granted is not only a testimony of his strength and character, but also a testimony that the American Dream lives on. I am also extremely  awed by the people who have helped Mr. Beah along the way. Truly, the human spirit flourishes even in the most awful circumstances.  Reading this book you will be reminded how fortunate we are to be living in a free, peaceful, democratic society that abounds with opportunity and hope...things that many countries of the world lack.  Things that the like of Ishmael Beah and all others deserve.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|From Oliver Stone, the Oscar-winning director of \\"Platoon,\\" \\"JFK\\" and \\"Alexander,\\" comes \\"World Trade Center,\\" a powerful film that recounts the story of two Port Authority policemen who became trapped when the World Trade Center collapsed around them on the morning of September 11, 2001. The film features terrific performances by an amazing cast, including Nicholas Cage, Michael Pena, Maria Bello, and Michael Shannon. Powerful imagery and amazing storytelling help fuel the film's story of the good that came from a day of darkness. If you enjoy films about courage, survival, and the good in man, then you're sure to enjoy \\"World Trade Center.\\"<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen just about every Jane Eyre adaptation ever, and I must say this is the best one yet. It is not as faithful to the story as the 1980's BBC version (starring Timothy Dalton), but this one has something that few other adaptations have--chemistry. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens work so well together as Jane and Rochester. You can tell they love each other, and, more importantly, you can believe it. This would by my first recommendation for someone wanting to see a Jane Eyre movie. Bravo, BBC and Masterpiece Theater!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston vocalist Brad Delp died today. His soaring and wonderful voice excelled on \\"Something About You\\" \\"Peace Of Mind\\" and the memorable \\"More Than A Feeling\\". Brad Delp was 55 years old. He was a humane vegetarian for 37 years and supported charitable causes for children and animals. He loved the Beatles. The CD \\"Boston\\" is a legend. Tom Scholz and Brad Delp were an idyllic team. Boston will always be revered. God Bless Brad Delp !
B00005JNTX|5.0|A great rendition of a fantastic series by a comic writer that has created a brutally real universe.  A must see fer sure !  :)
B000EQ47HC|5.0|Brad Delp the lead vocalist of Boston died today. He was only 55 years old. Just remember his dynamic voice that soared on \\"Don't Look Back\\", lamented on \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" and was poignant on \\"Used To Bad News\\". Brad Delp was a humane vegetarian for 37 years and he loved children, animals and the Beatles. He was very charitable in addition to being an excellent live performer. \\"Don't Look Back\\" was and always will be an awesome CD.
1892005034|5.0|I am so excited about this book. I have already sent one to my daughter and sharing it with many of my clients. I am one of those people who is highly critical of myself. It is helping me to much more compassionate with me. It shares a wonderful, simple, eloquent way to communicate in all the areas of my life. This book is teaching me to love myself so I can truly care for others. It can pave the way for peace between people,different ethnic groups, countries, etc. and I believe our world really needs this.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I just don't get it.  You take the greatest selling Final Fantasy game... Probably the gratest game ever, and make a B movie from it.  I mean first the spirits within and now this.  They could have just made the movie off of The Final Fantasy VII game itself.  It was great that all of the characters were there, but maybe it should have been the original and not the sequel.

B00005JNJV|4.0|This is the best version of Batman to ever hit the screen.  It beat Tim Burton's 1989 version all to pieces and back again.  It is dark, stylish, and true enough to the comics to make die hards happy without alienating moviegoers who are not up to speed on the comics.  Think of it as a wink wink, nudge nudge by use of character names only comic readerswould know. <br /> <br />The cast is absolutely superb.  Christian Bale brings just the right amount of tormented soul to Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, and Katie Holmes is as pretty as always.  Add in the usual fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Liam Neesom, and you have the best comic book based film ever. <br /> <br />Please suppot this film so we can get bigger and better movies featuring comic book characters.
0743487583|4.0|On my recent travels, I finished reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.<br /><br />Written in the Gothic style, it's also written as one would tell a ghost story: minimalist in its descriptions of setting, focusing on character and action more than anything else. It's written in the first person, with varying narrators allowing for varied points of view. Despite the threadbare descriptions of setting, Shelley does a good job of conveying with those few words key aspects of the setting, giving her story great atmosphere.<br /><br />Gothic stories always are high on emotion, and not high on reasoning thought, and this is no exception. I am still left wondering how folks can consider this a work of science fiction. It is more fantasy than science fiction: man takes on the role of God, man's creation, like God's, goes awry, and the pair are locked in a monumental struggle. Fantasy's themes often go to the nature of characters trying to choose between right and wrong, while science fiction's themes go towards the consequences of technology and science, without the necessity of morality, and Frankenstein tends towards fantasy under that line of thinking...hence, the alternate title, \\"The Modern Prometheus\\".<br /><br />All in all, an entertaining, and quick read.
B000001F26|3.0|While the joke about Clapton (like coffee) sucking without Cream isn't true, he certainly made his best work in the '60's. Which is why I'd point any Clapton newbie to The Cream of Clapton, rather than Timepieces, since it contains not only all of his solo hits (which are a mixed bag, I'll admit, but there are some good ones), but also offers up a few Cream, Blind Faith and Dominoes tracks. This mainly focuses on solo Clapton, other than Layla (with Derek & the Dominoes - NOT the only good song the band recorded!) This can be good - after all, you get After Midnight, I Shot the Sheriff, Let It Grow, Cocaine and Lay Down Sally. But on the other end of the scale, Wonderful Tonight, Promises, and his take on Knockin' on Heaven's Door - not bad, just mediocre. And I'm sorry, but Wonderful Tonight and Promises are hellspawn - along with I've Got a Rock 'n' Roll Heart (sounds like he never frickin' PLAYED rock), they constitute my Axis of Clapton's Evil. The absence of Let It Rain SHOULD be  an enormous red flag, since it's far and away the single best song of his solo career. Motherless Children is also missed, and as I said before, a few '60's tunes would've been appreciated.<br /><br />This is completely worthless now that The Cream of Clapton exists, but if that's considered contraband where you live (but this one isn't - hey, stranger things have happened), Timepieces makes for a good alternative.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I watched this movie, being on an Angelina Jolie kick, and I have to tell you - I have NEVER watched a movie twice in a row... until this movie.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  The cast is stellar!
B0000028M7|5.0|Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, Pearl Jam's Eddie Veder, and  Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong are all sitting in an old West-style salloon. Each is clutching an album that has been claimed \\"Best of the '90's\\": Billie Joe has Dookie, Cobain has Nevermind, and Veder has Ten. Then Layne Staley busts in, clutching a copy of Dirt. He sits down, orders a drink, and challenges everyone in the bar to a fight. Bllie Joe of course doesn't have a chance, because Green Day's the worst band ever and he knows it, so of course Staley chases him out of town. Cobain puts up a bit more of a fight, but eventually realizes it's futile, and surrenders. So now it's down to Staley and Veder - in the end, Staley wins out.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is Dirt is the best album of the '90's - not only that, one of my favorites ever. It's a dark, creepy, sludgy concept album about the horrors of heroin addiction. It probably scares small children. And it's got the best song of the '90's: Rooster. If you can imagine the heaviness of Black Sabbath merged with the melodic instincts of the Beatles, you've got Dirt.<br /><br />1. Dem Bones: 10/10<br /><br />2. Dam That River: 10/10<br /><br />3. Rain When I Die: 10/10<br /><br />4. Down in a Hole: 10/10<br /><br />5. Sickman: 10/10 (some fans don't like it, but I love the pummeling chorus/slow verse contrast)<br /><br />6. Rooster: 100/10<br /><br />7. Junkhead: 8/10<br /><br />8. Dirt: 7/10<br /><br />9. God Smack: 10/10<br /><br />10. Iron Gland: N/A. Worst song on the album, but because it's only forty seconds long that can be forgiven.<br /><br />11. Hate to Feel: 10/10<br /><br />12. Angry Chair: 10/10<br /><br />13. Would?: 10/10<br /><br />Needless to say, this is a complete masterpiece that's almost impossible to review objectively. I'll stop trying now. Just buy it. You won't be disappointed.
630469654X|5.0|I stumbled across this movie a while back on VHS, and have been trying to find it on DVD as my other copy was fried from overuse.  Yes, it's an older film, but in the way of a medieval romance film, it's very good.  Lots of twists and turns, the actors are very good, and the work with the animals is great as well.  I knew Matthey Broderick from Ferris Beuler's Day Off, and this younger actor is great to see!  If you're up for a good 80's action romance set with knights and a romantic curse, this would be the movie!
0743454537|4.0|Alright, first, I'll say I agree with many people, this book was FANTASTIC, but the ending completely ruined it.  There were some other things I didn't like.  But I did really love this book as a whole.  The plot was so interesting, and it really put you in the shoes of people in a family in which one person has cancer.  It was a great plot because it is so controversial during this time.  The characters were well developed, and it was very easy to read.  I'm a slow reader, yet I wanted to finish this book soon, and I could-I finished it in about 3 days.  I really enjoyed reading from different character's perspectives, especially Sarah's, whose started in the early 1990s and gradually worked its way up to present day.  However, there are some things I did not like about this book.  For example, it seemed that at least once or twice during a passage, a complex metaphor would be stated, and then one sentence after it would be something like, \\"I just realized that this connects to my life.\\"  As in the character's point of view.  I didn't think that metaphors were needed to see what was going on in the story.  In addition, I found Julia, the guardian ad litem, to be extremely annoying.  She was very flaky, and I didn't see her point in the story, other than to maybe make it over 400 pages long.  I was much more interested in the Fitzgeralds than Julia, and since she was often associated with Campbell, I sometimes got annoyed at him, too.  Also, Brian and Jesse were what would be \\"Supporting Actors\\" in a movie.  I expected at least one of them to come into play during the end of the book; they did not.  It seems like they were mostly used as filler characters.  Finally, the ending was not what I expected, kind of.  During the middle of the book, I actually guessed that Jesse would die in a car accident or drug overdose and they would use his kidneys for Kate, even if it wasn't a total match.  Surprisingly, Anna took this path instead.  I did not like this ending at all.In the copy I have, it has an interview with the author, who explained why she chose the ending.  She felt that medically, it had to end this way, or something along the lines of that.  To me, that just seems like an easy way out.  Based on the rest of the book, I know that this author is extremely talented and perhaps she should have spent more time on the ending.  Also, I have some confusion:  If Anna admitted that she didn't even want medical emancipation, but Kate did, why didn't they just end the trial then and there?!  One more thing, when Sarah remembers back to when she was pregnant with Anna and she was at the hairdresser getting her hair done, she remembers someone getting her hair died pink.  Julia once had pink hair.  I thought that towards the end of the book, the author would reveal that those people were the same person, and this would create more content.  However, this is never revealed.  Overall, this book was great, with a superb plot and great characters.  However, because of some flaws, I have to give it a 4/5.  I am eager to read other books by this author.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|One little-known film that earned an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film that I have seen twice in theaters is \\"The Lives of Others\\" which hails from Germany. The film is set in East Germany during 1984 and Stasi (i.e. secret police) Captain Gerd Weisler is assigned to monitor the activities of a playwright and his actress girlfriend due to their being suspected of associating with dissidents.     Weisler later starts to question his mission and the communist ideals he subscribes to when he finds out that he is spying on the couple in question to satisfy the desires of a government Minister who lusts after the playwright's girlfriend. The Minister wants the playwright out of the way so he can have the actress for himself.     This movie is very well done and it is also an indictment of altruism by implication not only due to its thrashing the idea that it is the duty of people to live for the sake of a cause (in this case communism) but the movie also shows what totalitarianism is in theory and in practice.     Weisler's daily monitoring of the couple begins to affect him. Slowly, the cold, calculating personality he acquired from his job serving the East German state peels off when Weisler hears the warmth and humanity that the couple's art lends to them. Weisler becomes more human and as a result makes a series of ethical decisions that he hadn't thought of in the past.     This isn't a suspense or thriller in the sense of a James Bond film since it relies more on character development than car chases, respectfully. However, it is a slick thriller in its own right. If you have a chance to see The Lives of Others in theaters or buy it on DVD, please do.     You will get your money's worth!
1400064287|5.0|This is an excellent book that gives the secret of what makes any idea stick - meaning understood, remembered and acted upon. The idea could be anything - a commercial for a product, a message delivered by a corporate CEO or a research finding. It needs to have 6 basic ingredient to make it sticky. Important thing is that once you understand these 6 basic ingredient, author claims that creativity plays a smaller role in making idea stick. In fact, we have lot of sticky ideas around us - much more than any one creative genius can produce. It is important to spot these ideas and even for spotting them you need to understand the 6 elements that the idea should have. These six ingredients are SUCCESs - Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible,Emotional, Story.  <br />Author gives numerous examples to emphasize the points. The book is well written and is interesting to read. The content page is organized in a novel way so as to create highlights of each chapter. The end has a well written summary that acts as a good reference. <br />I would recommend this book for managers, leaders and for anyone who wants to communicate messages that sticks. 5 Stars!!!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Not too long ago...I was completely convinced that Global Warming was a result of Co2 emissions and man.....I was completely sold on Al Gores message of Global Warming. I said to myself..that it really sounds convincing....but soon after I stumbled upon additional information that supports the fact that Al Gore is wrong! I found out that the government as a whole wants us to believe in this man made \\"Global Warming\\". I investigated deeper...and learned that the Sun is actually increasing its heat emissions ( the sun is getting hotter, etc.) Now..there is a huge umbrella of financial schemes that the Powers that be want to play on us. Much of it involves a Global Warming Tax ( that simply won't change global warming or the suns heat ) The Powers that be have found another way to steal more money from us. Wait to the near future...we will all be asked to pay fees and taxes for this Global warming that man has nothing to with. I have read overwhelming documentation that says that C02 emissions only change the earths overall temperature less than 0.1% Please keep an open mind to what I'm telling you...lets not be fooled by the global elites.
1582701709|5.0|With something like 3.5 million copies sold in just a few months, The Secret looks like its going to change the world. Yes, its not really a secret, as these teachings have been in many books published in the last century, but that's irrelevant. Now is the time for it to be known. This book and video are wonderful. I recommend getting the audio and playing it in the background on your computer while you work, or on your stereo or in the car. You keep getting more and more, deeper and deeper.  <br /> <br />To those who think it hogwash, its not, it really works. To those who think it's evil or unchristian, it's not, as even Jesus taught it. Read Mark 11:20-26, where he tells you exactly how to do it. These teachings promise to end all suffering, limitation and hate. Naysayers are going to be left behind for a while, until they see everyone around them rocketing forward and they start to listen.  <br /> <br />One reviewer on TV said it's unscientific. No. The scientific model states you form a hypothesis, test it, and test it again to get reproducible results. Then you have an answer. Many have done this over and over. Proof. It works. This isn't about linear, Newtonian thinking, but non-linear dynamics, where all is connected and influenced by everything else. That's what the quantum physicists are finding. Mind is everything. Let's start using it, and open our hearts to life and each other.  <br /> <br />The Secret tells us the time for wrangling, fighting, struggling and hate are over, with all our needs filled by the provident spirit of consciousness. Some call that God, some call it metaphysics. Just call it. It will answer, \\"Your wish is my command.\\"
B000066NW0|5.0|I recently rediscovered her again after going through my CD collection. I was 12 when this album was released and it was one of my favorites for a long time. I hadn't gotten into any \\"good classic music\\" at that point, so I didn't have anything to compare her to. Being 16 now and being into late 80's-90's pop-rock and bands such as RHCP, I can still say her CD sounds good with time. I stopped listening to her because i thought she was a major poseur and trash, as my friends influenced me, but this has become a guilty pleasure CD. As she's released new material, such as \\"Under My Skin\\" and the new one coming out in April with that song \\"Girlfriend,\\" it doesn't feel the same. She sounds naive and more relatable to teenagers in this CD. With songs like \\"Complicated\\" (good summer of '02 nostalgia), \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" and lesser known songs like \\"Words I'll Never Say,\\" \\"Naked,\\" and \\"Too Much To Ask,\\" compiled with the especially good originality anthem, \\"Anything But Ordinary,\\" this CD shouldn't be lumped in a pile with her new stuff. She used to be better than that - a girl who knew how to influence teens to be themselves and no one else. Just listen to it. No, I mean, really listen to it. It's good fare for any teenager or pre-teen who just wants to feel accepted. <br /> <br />A+++ for this throw-back CD for the teenage category. :)
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is a great collections of songs. For a bunch of guys so young, they have great insight into the workings of life as we grow older. Some of these songs will bring tears to your eyes. A couple do everytime I hear them (\\"What Sara Said\\" for instance). Well worth adding to any music collection.
B000002H70|5.0|I had always liked the singles I heard from The Cure on the radio and MTV, but that was as far as my relationship with them went.  Then one day, many years ago when I was still in denial about the dangers of ultra-violet radiation, I went to a tanning salon and checked out this CD to listen to while I laid in the UV cocoon.   <br /> <br />The opening track began, but I could barely hear it over the fans.  What was that tinkling sound?  I need to turn it up... a little more... louder still... and then suddenly without warning... <br /> <br />WHOOOOOSHHH!  The organic opening chord of \\"Plainsong\\" crashed over me like a tidal wave.  Stunned, I laid back and let the music wash over me for the rest of my tanning session.  But alas it was only a 20-minute session, and this album is well over an hour long.  I anxiously looked forward to my next tanning session, and I continued checking out this CD with each visit until I had listed to the whole thing.  And then I listened to it again.  And again.  Until I eventually wised up and bought my own copy.   <br /> <br />You've probably heard the singles from this CD on the radio, or in commercials, or movie soundtracks or what have you: \\"Lovesong\\", \\"Pictures Of You\\", \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Fascination Street\\".  Those are the most \\"accessible\\" songs on the album, yet they do not stand out like sore thumbs -- they homogenize beautifully alongside the moodier, darker tunes.   <br /> <br />I personally like \\"Prayers for Rain\\" the best, especially the low, powerful chords and primal drum beats that open the song.  It's a tune that would have been perfectly at home on \\"The Crow\\" soundtrack (as would a few of the other songs on this album).  I can't really quantify the musical genre: is it Moody Pop?  Surreal Shoegazing?  Trance-infused Alternative?  Lushly produced Chill-Out?  It's all of these at once, yet it also creates its own unique musical flavor that I've never quite encountered before.  <br /> <br />If you like intelligent songwriting,plush mixing, deeply complex layered sounds, all lushly produced, then wrap this thick velvet robe of music around yourself and let it carry you away to undiscovered places.  A landmark '80s masterpiece that belongs in everyone's collection.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie is fantastic! It has twists and turns and really makes you think! Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson head up this star studded cast. <br /> <br />Harold Crick (played by Will Ferrell) is a lonely IRS agent whose mundane existence is transformed when he hears a mysterious voice narrating his life.  He discovers that he is a main character of a novel in progress. The surface story is interesting, entertaining and has one wondering if Harold will be able to track down the author before the novel concludes. But there is a deeper story here and it is the story of man and his relationship to God.  God writes the script for our lives and we don't always agree with the way the scenes play out.  <br />
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Very few movies have captured human essence as this one did and fewer still in such a razor-sharp magnanimous way. Phenomenal acting and production. A special thank you to all of the actors as each of them performed flawlessly. Everything was perfect  - directing, production, lighting, scores - this one is worth (and will get) an award.

1582701709|1.0|We're surrounded by quantum energy, and our minds, apparently, are conduits for this limitless and universal power source; we just need to tune our mental frequencies properly and... next thing you know all your dreams will be realities.  Just make sure you take some heavy hallucinogenic drugs to enjoy the full \\"quantum\\" effect (that's the REAL secret).    Lots of documented evidence in this book, of course, because the co-authors are telling you so-- even namedropping Newton, Beethoven, Einstein, etc. and taking them totally out of context to support claims that were never made.  A work of marketing par excellence.  Wishful thinking, junk science, pseudo-religion.    Also, contrary to claims, not one of the ideas in this book is in anyway new-- just the same old New-Age, self-help bulls**t with different, vaguely scientific-sounding names and slight variations on themes.  P.T. Barnum, you are vindicated once again.    P.S. If you really want to learn something simple enough for kids but eternally true and useful for adults try the children's classics \\"The Little Engine That Could, and \\"Stone Soup.\\"   These books have true wisdom and some pretty pictures, too.
0763627410|5.0|My son is 2 1/2 and he loves this book!  We read it together a couple of times a day.  He looks at the pictures and flips through this book several times a day and the wording is so simple that he even recites the correct wording for each page from memory.  The pictures are bright and interesting and the pages are of thick, good quality paper.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I have mixed emotions towards this film.  It is quite unique as it is not really part of the Bond series, yet it still is.  It was produced by the company that had the copyright of the script but not the movie series so it lacks the traditional Bond theme and it was released the same year as Octapussy and they competed against each other. <br />This was also Connery's last perfomance as James Bond and lathough he is nowhere close to his originla 60's perfomances he is way better than Roger Moore.  The script is a remake of Thunderball but not as good as the original and it does have some flat points. <br />If one judges this film with today's standarts then the film is quite weak- however if you judge it with the rivals of its time then this film does have merit.  Klaus Maria Brandauer is a wondeful villain but on the other hand Kim Basinger perfomance is rather poor. <br />All in all this film is worth seeing if you are a Bond fun but do not have high expectations and that way you will enjoy it
B000E41MS6|4.0|My first experience with the DOCTOR was a wonderful ride <br />highly recomended to one and all
B00004TJKI|5.0|This film is one of the best of its kind. Excellent courtroom and small town drama.  Both the cast and the directing could not be better.  The characters are vey well developed and the add to the rising of the drama. I would not want to single out a perfomance from any of the actors as all of them act in manner that compliments each others perfomance. <br />The topic of this film is controversial, if the woman was raped or not, and the director \\"plays\\" with it so to keep the viewer even more interested. <br />Five star film.
B000M4RG42|4.0|Good story.  To many flashbacks out of sequence so it can get confusing.  Much better than \\"Letters From Iwo Jima.\\"
B000FIMG68|5.0|I'd like to thank you for that. It arrived very fast and it was very good.
B000063JZQ|4.0|I have been teaching \\"Macbeth\\" for 30 years and have used this Roman Polanski/Hugh Hefner film to let my students \\"see\\" the play. In fact, my colleagues and I used the videocassette so often that just recently the tape broke. There is much about the production that I like: the authentic 11th century costumes, the acting, the professional delivery of Shakespeare's lines, and the sets.  However, I wonder why those who produced this film chose to destroy two of the most famous scenes - Act IV, scene 1 and Act V, scene 1 - with nudity.  There is absolutely no sound reason for nudity in either of these scenes. Because of the nudity, I cannot show these two scenes to my high school students. I also cannot show Act IV, scene 2, where Macduff's family is murdered, because of the frontal view of a nude young boy and because of the \\"murderers\\" raping some of the Maduff staff. (Wasn't murdering the whole family enough?) I am not aware of another movie version of the play; I would have purchased it instead so that my students could see the entire play.
B00005JPLU|4.0|I don't think I was the only audience finding the massive semi-naked muscular brawny Spartan warriors in 300 to be the absolute eye-candy in this film. Those men have more chest than Lena Heady and other women in the film. That being said, doesn't mean that the film doesn't have other attractions. Compare to Frank Miller's Sin City, 300 is obviously more violent and lavish in production, even though I know most of the landscapes and sets are CGI. The film is pure thrill and it's very popcorn entertainment. There is very little dialogue once the actions start to take over as the main \\"sell\\" of the show. As a matter of fact, I found the dramatic non battle scenes to be inadequate or weak for a period movie. Still, the film continue to be a captivating experince with so much bloody and gruesome fight scenes with monsters and imortals. I am used to seeing the over-the-top Hong Kong kung fu movies, so the fight scenes here came across as dull but it's intended to be as realistic as it was meant to be. I was constantly trying to pay attention to Gerard Butler's performance. He's very good at delivering all those very macho and angry expressions and his battle scenes are pretty convincing. At times, all those 8-packs and bulging chests effortlessly stole the show. I was very impressed with the visuals overall, and some of the makeup and wardrobe were quite amazing, especially those piercings all over Rodriguez Santoro who played the Persian King. Too bad he didn't even get to do any fighting,'cause his appearance is so striking but brief screentime. I was not familiar with the comic book, so the ending was a bit dissatisfying in a way. I couldn't help myself comparing Butler's look and performance to Russell Crowe in Gladiator. I think he's far more appealing physically, but the role is limited in dramatic range than Crowe's.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|After waiting over 30 years for a movie to be made of one of my favorite stories, I was sorely disapppointed in this production.  There was barely anything in the movie which was true to the original epic poem.  The best part of the movie was the scenery and the costumes.  My least favorite part was Grendel conceiving a child with a witch. This epic poem has been read by generations of English-speaking people, not because it is easy to read but because it is a great story.
0736063684|5.0|Put quite simply, this is the bible of strength training!  I have the women's version of this book (lower body) and finally decided to buy this general one so that I could refresh my knowledge of the proper technique for key upper body strength training exercises.  I love the way this book shows the pictures of muscles involved and the proper/improper way to do the exercises.  It also explains the why and why not of the exercises.  If you are serious about your strength training and want to know how to do it right, get this book.  I hope that Mr. Delavier will someday publish an even larger version of this with more exercises.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost is the most fantastic show on TV today.  The second season continued the show's theme illustrating the clash between science and faith. The plot twists are uncanny while divulging island mythology and insight into the survivors' pasts. The introduction of new characters, including the \\"others\\" and the tail section survivors, kept me glued to the television. As one episode ended, I couldn't wait to see the next. The second season is a must-see series!!!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Being a comic fan, I feel ashamed to say I never read the comic.  So instead of grabbing it before the movie, I decided to wait.  It was well worth the wait.  The story was good and seeing it, even though sometimes movies dont do justice to novels or books, is definately a must for all.
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|If you watch the movie, you will love the soundtrack.  The songs are so funny.  All the songs are mostly pop and 80's pop.  You can definitely sing too...There are no high notes or low notes.  It gets boring fast but hey, it's really funnny..

B000LXHK2C|2.0|Pair Gladiator director Ridley Scott together with his Academy Award winning Maximus, aka Russell Crowe and you would expect to come away with something with a little more bouquet than the sappy vinegar served up in this scenically -pleasing, feel-good wannabe about a London bonds trader's epiphany about love and life in the south of France.  Sadly, even with the golden halcyon veneer of too many lazy Provencal afternoons, A Good Year fails to deliver the grapes; the revelational concoction of savoring little moments while discovering beautiful sun-kissed people amidst fields of Van Gogh blues and yellows gets lost in the structural miasma of a truly bad script. Scott's bucolic suggestion of home where Maximus of Gladiator repeatedly and lovingly fingers his growing grain in the Roman outreach of Iberia to the strains of Hans Zimmer's hypnotic score relays more of the essence of Mayle's original idea for \\"A Good Year\\" than the film's entire 114 minute playing time.<br /><br />Its not that Russell Crowe can't do romantic comedy; he certainly possesses the charm, talent and good looks,  Although he seems highly suited for his Londonderry Gordon Gekko counterpart, he appears to have taken just a little too much Prozac for the idyllic south of France scenes where a spacey grin facilitates eternal contemplation of his early life with his life-lusty uncle (Albert Finney) spent on the family's vineyard  The hodgepodge script ping-pongs back and forth as the adult Crowe, inheritor of his uncle's estate, meanders towards the realization that a future  life on the vineyard will far exceed one cutting people's financial throats on the London exchange.<br /><br />What's painful about this film is that it tries too hard to come off as the intoxicating magical adventure that it was intended to be. It brags of an emotional depth of expression that it does not possess.  Unlike other films that rely heavily on location to evoke a sense of timeless beauty----Under the Tuscan Sun comes to mind----A Good Year fails to embrace the audience, pull it in and keep it bedazzled.  In romantic comedy, a degree of formula is expected, even desired, but there is nothing here that allows one to lose oneself in the panorama of delight that although advertised, does not exist on any level.<br /><br />Bottom line?  If you enjoy the \\"chuck it all and buy a ramshackle farm in some remote and timeless corner of the world\\" genre, you may be as tempted as I was to thoroughly fantasize for over two hours of doing just so.  Don't.  A picture book of Tuscany or Provence will far better evoke that sought for feeling.<br /><br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br /><br />renofc@mindspring.comun comes to mind----A Good Year fails to embrace the audience, pull it in and keep it bedazzled.

B000LY4KWO|4.0|I think, whenever I watch Pierce Brosnan in action as James Bond, that the casting is almost too perfect.  A risk-free phone call for all concerned if ever there was one: \\"Pierce...we're ready for you.  You're free now, right?--Or do we call again in another ten years?\\".      Goldeneye delivers Bond as it was known and loved for so many years.  How do you complain about something that is designed to work so well?  The biggest challenge is selling Dame Judi as M, and she gets mere minutes of screen time, delivering the most contrived speech of the film.    What exactly am I supposed to say here about the plot of your standard James Bond film, as displayed in Goldeneye?  Do you really need the rundown?  Should I just give the 4 star review and leave?  Okay, okay.  There's this Russian dude, General Ourumov, who gets a bit above himself by stealing things that don't belong to him but which help him threaten parts of the world, on behalf of some sinister criminal mastermind code-named Janus.  First he steals a Tiger helicopter, which is, like all tigers, immune to the effects of an Electromagnetic Pulse.  Then he steals the Goldeneye weapon, which can create a massive and uber-destructive Electromagnetic Pulse.  In the process, he kills a lot of Russian comrades, which does make the Russian Defence Minister a bit suspicious about a slight internal problem, but what he really needs to clear up this mess--mostly after he's been murdered, unfortunately--is a buttinksy British superspy teamed with the only surviving witness to Ourumov's treachery, following the trail to Janus, via a rather circuitous route.      Along the way, Bond gets help from some CIA guy who is not Felix Leiter, gets mauled a few times by the lovely Xena Onatopp, who has definitely blurred the line between unsafe sex and the best way to die with a smile on your face.  She's Ourumov's chief muscle--there's just something so wrong about putting it quite that way--and other peoples' pain is her ecstasy.A gorgeous Famke Janssen, as Onatopp, is another example of risk-free casting--those cowards (thank goodness!).  And Onatopp is just one method that Ourumov and the mysterious Janus employ to kill Bond; most of the others don't involve spine-crushing sex.  They aim a whole train at him, some missiles, many many machine-guns, another missile, and Bond must think fast to side-step them all, especially a Russian gangster with a grudge, splendidly played by Robbie Coltrane--and believe me, side-stepping Robbie Coltrane is no easy task.    Minnie Driver has a cameo as fingernails being scraped across a blackboard, by the way.  I love Minnie so this is a bonus, except for that noise coming out of her mouth.  (Don't worry, Minnie, I bought your CD, so I know the truth).   Meanwhile, back to Famke Janssen, who is much more memorable than whoever that good-girl Bond girl was, in this film.  Sean Bean got some bad reviews for his role in this film, but I think he's just fine as a cretin.  Meanwhile back to Famke Janssen.      Bond's fight to save London from being Electromagnetically Pulsed back to the Stone Age ends with the usual bright orange bang, which only goes to prove that real explosions are much more fun than electromagnetic pulses anyway.  And Bond gets to walk away from all the mayhem with the good-girl on his arm secure in the knowledge that he has made no emotional commitments to anything.  Thus, this film cannot rank as high as On Her Majesty's Secret Service, or Casino Royale, even in its most terrific moments, and there are many.  But we need eighteen-or-so formulaic Bond films that do their job well, so that the bold experiments can stand out all the more.    As trad Bond outings go, this is a winner.  Alan Cumming becomes gradually less annoying every time I watch his performance as a Russian computer nerd, meanwhile back to Famke Janssen, and Pierce Brosnan is too perfect as Bond James Bond.  But then, too perfect is still perfect, though that's not quitethe same as very unique (Daniel Craig).
B000B8QG0O|4.0|`Toy Story 2' is a more fluid and intricate sequel than the original.  Containing more sight gags and a myriad of peril, the toys come back to life for a new adventure.  This time Woody (Tom Hanks) is unraveling, literally at the shoulder socket and not just highstrung.  In danger of being sold or taken for granted by his boy owner, Andy, Woody, nevertheless, has the selflessness to pull a toy penguin out of the yard sale bin.  In the meantime, a greedy toy collector steals him after the mother refuses to make a deal.  As you might expect, the other toys sojourn out to rescue him.  What makes it all fun is an attempt to find him at a local toy store, and  a journey to the toy collector's high rise.  Finding new toys like \\"Stinky Pete, the Prospector\\" (Kelsey Grammar) and a Cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) add to the colorful fun.  Witty and freewheeling, 'Toy Story 2' springs to life.  Fun from start to finish, 'Toy Story' only begs one question:  Toys coming to life.  Why didn't somebody think of it before?
B000N6TX1I|5.0|When going to see Children of Men, I had little to low opinion upon it.  The trailers did not at all do this justice, painting it instead as some sort of typical dystopian sci-fi action thriller with lots of chase scenes and explosions.<br /><br />What I got instead was not only brilliantly acted, but incredibly gritty and realistic, and save for the light leap of faith required in believing that all people would become infertile within 20 years, completely realistic.<br /><br />Clive Owen (Theo) is absolutely perfect as the 40-something man who sneaks scotch into his coffee and carries it around all day, uses Baby Diego's death (youngest person on earth, 18) as an excuse to skip work and hang out with his buddy Jasper (Michael Caine), and has virtually nothing left to live for after his daughter's death and his divorce, who gradually becomes a man with a purpose to get Kee (the pregnant girl) to Africa, where the Human Project awaits her.<br /><br />The scenes which show the dystopian future are elegantly done to show just how far society has fallen as infertility rose among the world, without lingering too much or being overly brutal on the senses.  Seeing rioters hurl stones at a moving train Theo is in, or a bomb go off in a London coffee shop is so unthinkable in this day and age and yet shot so realistically it's almost as if watching it through a documentary camera.<br /><br />It's interesting and somewhat disturbing to see the way immigrants to Britain are treated, strikingly similar to the way of Jews in Nazi Germany, and yet with the same tone and anti-immigrant sentiment in the country as modern-day United States, as when Theo and the others sneak into a refugee camp, Kee's friend is brutalized by the British guards for not following orders fast enough, and taken outside with a burlap sack put over her head.<br /><br />The last scene in the movie, the battle sequence in an immigrant camp building, shot all in one take, is the most powerful scene of the whole movie, and I had tears in my eyes watching it, just seeing the reactions of the people on screen, and the emotional power and brilliance of the scene.  The cinematrography, the sound, the picture, the acting, everything was just perfect.<br /><br />All in all, Children of Men was in my opinion the best movie of all in 2006, and it's a shame it didn't win any awards of importance.l scene of the whole movie, and I had tears in my eyes watching it, just seeing the reactions of the people on screen, and the emotional power and brilliance of the scene.

B0002BO05S|4.0|`The Greatest Story Ever Told' is magnificent.  It has a classic sweep and splendor that lives up to its title.  While there are some questional interpretations, and some scenes are unnecessarily plodding, the performances are strong and the crowd scenes are often rousing.  Filmed in Utah, the cinematography gives grandeur to match the film.  Max Von Sydow provides a proper transcendence as Jesus, and Charlton Heston demonstrates both passion and prudent understatement as John the Baptist.   Honorable mention goes to Telly Savalas who gives the right ambiance to Pilate.  Furthermore, Judas's portrayal as the conflicted betrayor has a proper subtlety even if his lines don't always match the character.  (\\"I don't want the money,\\" the apostle known for robbing the common purse, says.)  Sal Mineo, Sidney Poitier, Donald Pleasance and a myriad of others also guest star.  Even John Wayne makes a token appearance as the centurion that can be measured in seconds, making 'The Greatest Story...' the 'A Bridge Too Far' of Christian cinema.        George Stevens wrote, directed, and produced this epic.   His technical aspects solidify a masterful treatment.  However, one could quibble with his directing for making it too tame in places and for his screenplay's discrepancies.   (In another example, Martha chastises Jesus, but in the Bible she says, \\"Even now you could bring him [Lazarus] to life.\\")  While Stevens' interpretations substitute scripture in places, the raising of Lazarus, Jesus triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and his crucifixion give the spark of passion this venue deserves.   Furthermore, implementing Handel's Messiah in key scenes is a masterstroke.  All said and done, 'The Greatest Story Ever Told' is a reverent and relevant portrayal of Jesus and his life.

B000JLTRKE|3.0|Oliver Stone has always been a director of grit, one who was unafraid to take on controversial subjects and create powerful films that opened the audience's eyes to the mire below the surface. In WORLD TRADE CENTER he seems to have taken the opposite stance: take an historic tragedy that affected the entire world and reduce it sown to the entrapment of two Port Authority Police Officers in the rubble of the midline of the two towers destruction in hopes that the event might become more intimate. He manages to just the opposite - he makes a huge horrific tragedy seem like a family crisis and despite casting some fine actors in the roles of actual people, the film falls short of communicating the bigger picture.<br /><br />The film starts well enough with two of the policemen rising early in the Am to go to routine duty, then the unrecognizable 'bump' sound occurs and quite to everyone's disbelief the events of that terrible day unfold in a manner that does indeed convey the complete surprise of a nation of people unfamiliar with terror happening on home ground. The Port Authority Police enter the impending collapse of the towers to save victims only to become quickly trapped in the rubble, reducing their ranks to two men who hold on for survival that finally comes.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is the sergeant John McLoughlin who is trapped with Will Jimeno (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) while John's wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Will's pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the news of the day and the discovery that their husbands are trapped in the rubble. The long movie is a back and forth interplay between the trapped men and the terror of the families. Where Stone drops his credibility is in focusing on a retired Marine Staff Sergeant Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) who upon  hearing of the disaster gets a marine haircut and travels to the spot looking for survivors at night, eventually discovering John and Will and getting help for them to be rescued. That is all well and good, but the film adds the tag line 'We'll avenge the terrorists who did this' that seems like a credo for the irresponsible governmental attack on Iraq. It just takes away the film's energy and makes it a political PR piece. And that is too bad: the other film UNITED 93 is a far superior work in depicting the personal aspect of a national tragedy.

Carol Blackburn has written a comprehensive book covering the many techniques that are used in making beads.  Her section on \\"faux techniques\\" is a blessing.  It's nice to have all of those techniques in one book.The photography is lovely and the book inspires me to go back and use some of the techniques I have put on a back burner for a long time.

B000HBK3MM|3.0|I totally agree with all the wonderful reviews that proclaim Corinne to be the successor to the great soul singers of the past. However, this is just her first album, and its not even that great - even if you compare her to other 'soul' singers such as Alicia Keys.<br /><br />I think the buzz surrounding this record is well deserved only on one track - Put Your Records On - as its one of those transcedental pieces of art that will be remembered twenty years from now.<br /><br />The person I would most compare Corinne to is Sade. She sounds a little like her, and all her music has this tranquil, pleasant feel to it (unlike Norah Jones who can sound a bit insipid at times). \\"Like A Star\\" is a fine example. As the second single, it sounds like a watered down version of the first single, which in this case is not a bad thing - but what about creativity? I am reminded of similar novelty acts to come out of the UK this year. And let us not even start on Amy Winehouse (who if you haven't listened to yet, you should, though not for the reasons you think you should).<br /><br />My favorite track here is \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" as its the most jazz oriented number here. I find people saying a lot of good things about this record here but one thing not many people mention is the lack of \\"repeat value\\" this CD has. While I am usually a sucker for singer-songwriters of the female persuasion, I don't find myself equally enthralled with Corinne. Also, I read Corinne's recent interview where she states that Led Zeppelin (?!) is the biggest influence upon her music, but there is absolutely no trace of that to be found (not that I was looking for it - I was just wondering).<br /><br />I also think that Antonella Barba's performance of Corinne's first single on American Idol will do a lot for this CD (considering a lot more people recognize Barba by name these days than Bailey-Rae).<br /><br />Final Thoughts - This is a fine, happy record. Just don't buy into the current hype surrounding this artist, as she isn't THAT good. At best, she is a second-rung version of Sade/Macy Gray - and how this will translate into a consistently successful recording career I am not sure. For what its' worth, there are at least three genuinely good songs on this CD, so you might want to pick it up.surrounding this artist, as she isn't THAT good.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|The Arcade Fire is a special band (they mean it,man!). I've listened to Neon Bible three times through and have come up with the following: Their music is transcendent. What that means I don't know but check out groups like The Smiths, Neutral Milk Hotel and Radiohead and you'll understand. There's passion galore rising above the rough mix. The vocals are rousing (from both husband,Win Butler and wife,Regine Chassagne) and the music is innovative and ELECTRIC! Butler's lyrics are poignant and relevant in these terrifying times. If you like avant garde music (Folk, Indie, Punk etc) pick up Neon Bible and their brilliant debut, Funeral. You won't be disappointed.
B000G759LW|2.0|I have to wonder after reading some of the reviews here - am I even listening to the same album the other reviewers are? I have lived with this 2-CD set for the last three months, and let me tell you, it hasn't gotten any better with time.<br /><br />Let me just say that the two lead singles \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"Candyman\\" are the best produced tracks on this album. There is also a single called \\"Hurt\\" that I do not recommend. This album irritates me. How on earth could anyone sit through more than an hour of Christina's extremely ill-utilized voice. She \\"yells\\" her songs, and her pitch and register are just a bit too much for my ears. I am sorry if Christina fans are offended, but her voice needs to be toned down - a LOT.<br /><br />That said, this was one glorious mess of over-singing and shouting the lyrics out, all wrapped up in a faux 1920s jazz package - which made it even more revolting. You can put a hog in a wedding dress but you can't drag it to church. Christina doing jazz and blues is like Macaulay Culkin doing the salsa - unbelievable and idiotic. What irked me most is the beautiful packaging that RCA decided to give this set - the booklet sure is mighty fine - but I think what they did here was to take a few samples of some old jazz music, and reverse-engineer it on the premise of \\"How Badly can we rework this with Aguilera's voice thrown in?\\". It certainly sounds that way.<br /><br />And on \\"Hurt\\", which is already the fifteenth billion song Christina has written about familial abuse and hurt and pain and feelings, she comes across as one of these extremely vain people (and not in an Anastasia Beaverhausen sort of way) who have to travel back to their childhood repeatedly so they can dig up a few \\"issues\\" to sing about.<br /><br />The most shocking thing here is a track where Christina actually sings over telephone messages left by her fans, where they thank her for eradicating poverty, homelessness and saving the world. One boy even thanks her for preventing him from committing suicide. I'm not kidding. And Aguilera's oohing and aahing over these recordings is a bit tasteful - not to mention bizarre.<br /><br />Which is an excellent way to describe this hideous beast of an album. I cannot think of any expletives to use here - its that terrible. Her voice is nasal and overwrought, the song compositions are weak, the lyrics are just SO high-school, and once you listen up to Track 4 I am not sure how many of you would actually want to sit through this. Granted, you have a pretty woman fronting the mike, but if that was the criteria I bought records by, I would even condone Antonella Barba. Aguilera on the other hand has done much better before, and more solid work on her CDs like \\"Mi Reflejo\\" (which was such a beautiful Spanish CD).<br /><br />I think that she's still young and can afford to experiment, but the poor quality of music here does not quite absolve her of the crimes committed no this record. The one track I keep reaching for if I decide to amuse myself with this record is \\"I Got Trouble\\" which is supposed to sound VERY old-school and muffled, but ends up sounding gimmicky and very wanna-be. The persona Aguilera radiates very much reminds me of Madonna during her Vogue days when she had that whole Dick Tracy/Marilyn Monroe thing going. I didn't like it then and I sure as hell don't like it now.<br /><br />The sad part about this, is that when I compare this to Jessica Simpson's much maligned new album \\"A Public Affair\\", Jessica's album actually stands out, because its straight-forward, honest-to-god pop music that I know I will be listening to a year from now.<br /><br />Final Thoughts - Do yourself a favor and listen to every track on this CD before you buy it. Though the first single was good, the album is predominantly bad, and I'm not just saying that. If you're looking for really good pop music with a twist, I would suggest picking up Jojo's \\"The High Road\\" (Best Female Album of 2006, in my opinion), and Jessica Simpsons' \\"A Public Affair\\" (the reviews were bad, but the music is actually good).<br /><br />Two Stars. Not worth the hype.f 2006, in my opinion), and Jessica Simpsons' \\"A Public Affair\\" (the reviews were bad, but the music is actually good). <br /> <br />Two Stars. Not worth the hype.
1582701709|2.0|I picked this book up thinking there really WAS something to this so-called secret, but am finding as I dig into the book, that there's really nothing here to learn. As another reviewer wrote, bad things happen to good people all the time, no matter how much positive energy they put across... Just because you THINK positively about stuff and focus on whatever it is you're seeking doesn't mean it will fall into your lap. I figure what must be happening here is that you focus so hard and think so positive about something that you want in your life that after awhile you glean whatever might be construed as something positive reaffirming to your focus, little things.. that somehow convince you to think even harder on it.. because by then you're so obsessed you see anything as a positive towards gaining whatever it is you desire.    Glad I bought it at Costco for [...] bucks instead of paying the cost here plus shipping. Doubt I will finish it, and will most likely pass it on to the used book store..     Waste of my money.

B000M341QE|5.0|Film buffs will likely continue to debate the merits of \\"The Departed\\" for years. Does the film that finally earned a long overdue Oscar for director Martin Scorsese (as well as the Best Picture prize) rank with his best work? Does it deserve to stand beside \\"Raging Bull,\\" \\"Goodfellas,\\" or my own choice as Scorsese's greatest films, \\"King of Comedy\\" and \\"Casino\\"?<br /><br />Does it matter?<br /><br />Not really. \\"The Departed\\" is a terrific, complex thriller, the first epic cops and robbers flick since Al Pacino faced-off against Robert DeNiro in 1995's \\"Heat.\\" As one cynical critic noted, Martin Scorsese's film is mainly about \\"scumbags killing scumbags,\\" but though Leonardo DiCaprio's undercover cop has his rough edges, he's a good guy at heart, as is Mark Wahlberg's detective. It's Jack Nicholson as crime boss Frank Costello and Matt Damon as his informer in the Boston police department, who make even the most corrupt characters look angelic in comparison.<br /><br />There are quite a few twists and turns including two shocking deaths, but though it may be more entertainment than art, \\"The Departed\\" is a worthy addition to Scorsese's filmography, and a perfectly respectable choice with which to honor him with Hollywood's highest honor. The cast is terrific, of course, with Wahlberg stealing every scene he's in and Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin offering fine support.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks
0385508476|3.0|I loved the original Anne Frank I read well in High School. I thought this one would be really good now that I'm older. It was extremely hard to follow so I have had to put it down. I will try again later. It does have some very good parts in it and some pictures you haven't seen.
B000K7VHQE|2.0|I watched this movie twice - the second time just to understand if I was missing something that the critics were raving about - but no.<br /><br />I think that the only true dysfunctional tale on film has been told only twice - once on TV in the beautiful \\"Six Feet Under\\", and once in the offbeat comedy \\"The Daytrippers\\" with Parker Posey. After watching both of those, this seems like a poor second cousin, with very little going on that would qualify for so much praise.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I loved this movie - in parts. To me, the strongest actors were Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (who I think, is a good actress beyond her years, and a REAL actress unlike the young Dakota Fanning). Paul Dano plays the young Dwayne, and his is the most unnerving and realistic depiction of a troubled teen I have seen in some time. The other characters were good, but the actors weren't really breaking new ground with their performances. Toni Colette especially was disappointing. At one point, I used to watch every movie she was in, she was just THAT good, but of late she seems to be signing every weak film in existence. Weird.<br /><br />Alan Arkin did NOT deserve the Oscar for this performance. First of all, he dies half way through, and secondly, he had the most boring lines and the worst screen presence. That Oscar belonged to Hounsou for \\"Blood Diamond\\" - Arkin had no business getting it, as much as I love his body of work.<br /><br />What did not work for me was the climax - granted it is \\"Sweet\\", but what about reality? If the intention was to make a comedy, they should not have thrown in the element of realism that they tried so hard to create through the film - it was more of an anticlimax and a very disappointing one at that. I can see people smiling and clapping through the end of the movie, but I was just sitting there wondering \\"Is This It?\\".<br /><br />But if you must watch this movie, watch it for Paul Dano, the young star who plays the recluse Dwayne. That was the only good thing about this movie other than Abigail, and to me signalled the arrival of a huge new star.<br /><br />There are other better movies on the same lines out there - please check out the wonderful \\"The Daytrippers\\" starring Hope Davis and Parker Posey, as well as the Beauty Contest satire \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\". After those, you'll be left wondering why on earth \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is garnering so much praise.<br /><br />An average film. Don't buy it, just rent it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of the most enjoyable television series that I have watched in a long time. The characters are well fleshed out and after a few episodes it is easy to find yourself caring about the truobles they get into. <br /> <br />The show provides an interesting look at what the future of the human race in space might be like, and its very different from the Star Trek styled future. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes, westerns, sci fi, or just plain comedy. If you are a fan of the brittish show Red Dwarf, there is almost no reason not to buy this series too, especially as you get a lot more episodes in this disk set than you get one the RD DVD season disks, and for about the same price.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This is by far the best Batman movie. I give Batman Returns and Batman Begins a lot of credit, but you can't beat the cast assembled for this movie. The combination of Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson is incredibe, and Kim Basinger, Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance make a good supporting cast. The story is excellent, with plenty of action. Tim Burton could not have directed this movie any better, creating a dark and eerie feeling throughout the entire movie. Overall, this movie is superb in every category.
B0007CNXUK|2.0|I don't think anything about this film really gets going. I don't blame Winslet or Depp but I blame the director.

One of the most forgettable films I've seen.
0743496728|4.0|A lot of things can happen in 19 minutes, as Jodi Picoult points out in her opening chapter.  What WON'T happen in 19 minutes is you putting this book down.<br /><br />Nineteen Minutes follows the Picoult formula:  human drama, getting \\"inside the head\\" of her characters, switching back and forth between characters and their unique perspectives, and unpredictable plot switches.<br /><br />In Nineteen Minutes, a 17 year old goes on a shooting rampage in a high school, with multiple casualties.  He's caught immediately; why did he do such a thing?  Is there ever a psychological justification for \\"murder so foul\\"?<br /><br />I felt this novel moved much slower than a number of Picoult's other novels.  Perhaps it is because we've read about so many school shootings, trials, and rationales.  Is the topic itself, school shootings, too commonplace to get a reader pepped up?<br /><br />I thought Picoult's last two novels were not her best work.  I look forward to a rejuvenation.  Regardless, I  will look forward to Picoult's next book reveling the human condition.
1582701709|4.0|There's a lot of commercial spiritualism in this world, including this book. But by reading it, I was reminded of some very important things that I already knew but forgot to practice them. I always taught my children the \\"What goes around...comes around\\" theory. Lately, times have been tough, going through a split up relationship and watching my 13 year-old daughter's Mother get pregnant by a steroid junkie after only knowing him for four months. Now, my little girl is living in a 10 x 10 room in his basement. Last week, my Father passed away. This book helped me get through these tough times, it brought some old memories, thoughts and teachings back. Things that I shouldn't have ever abandoned in the first place but circumstantial situations caught up with me. There was depression, then anti-depressants, talking to a shrink, wanting to be on my own, tears, lonliness, etc. Now, I'm just sitting back and watching the show. It is not cool to ask or think unkind thoughts to happen to anyone, just have FAITH, be as good as a person that you can and then just watch things happen as they are meant too. Makes my life a lot more easier to deal with it. I'm starting to love myself all over again. I realized through this book that it would be almost impossible for someone else to love me if I don't love myself.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Set in Victorian era London and Colorado Springs, The Prestige is a story about two magicians/illusionists hell-bent on destroying each others' careers and, ultimately, their lives.  The movie is very captivating but entirely implausible.  Perhaps others do not have this same hang up, but it was hard for me to suspend belief that amazing technical advances -- that cannot be done today -- took place  a century ago.  There are many twists and turns in the plot, but each one is pretty easy to figure out before the \\"prestige\\" is revealed.<br /><br />Despite its implausibility and opaque \\"twists,\\" it's an enjoyable film.  I've noticed over the years that Hollywood seems to put out movies on themes in bunches (e.g. Viet Nam movies in the 80's, tornado movies in the 90's etc.) and The Prestige's counterpart is The Illusionist.  Both stories use \\"magic\\" as a plot device; both are really about revenge and getting away with murder.  The Prestige is the better of the two sister films.
B000002U9W|3.0|As a long time fan of Pink Floyd's music and finally coming to terms that there may never be another new Pink Floyd recording I decided to start checking out the portion of thier catalog that I had over looked for so many years. I started with 'Meddle' and decided to work back from there. I throughly enjoyed 'Meddle' and went to the next logical step 'Atom Heart Mother'. This one has been a mixed bag for me. I've listened to it multiple times with the hope that it will grow on me with each play. So far, I'm still waiting.<br /><br />The opening track & closing track have moments of brillance, but for every good moment there are moments that seem overindulgent & selfabsorbed. The remaining tracks: If (nice acoustic number), Summer of '68, & Fat Old Sun (both numbers are very Beatlesque)are much more easier for the listener to appreciate.<br /><br />All & all this is a good album, certainly worthy even for the casual Pink Floyd fan.

However, if you appreciate the licensed killer with a dry wit, this may be your Bond. <br /> <br />As some have noted the martini, gadget toting, womanizing Bond is gone...Bond before gaining worldly sophistication? <br /> <br />As far as I can remember there has always been a \\"casino\\" element in Bond films--even if a card game where balcony assistant aids in cheating.

As much as the chemistry between them, it was also obvious the two were compatable intellectually. <br /> As I said before-BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT. <br />

If you thought Amy was cute before, watch the DVD and see what you think! Very cool.
B00005JPLU|3.0|That's what I found myself wondering when I watched this movie.  The Persian army looked like one of Sauron's hordes (the Immortals made me think of Orcs) and the Greek traitor hunchback made me think of Golem.<br /><br />I also thought that the \\"corrupt priests\\" that Leonidas consulted resembled the Emperor from the Star Wars films.<br /><br />This being said, there were great combat sequences, and I think even the most pacifist-minded members of the audience could not help but be stirred by dialog where a Spartan responds to the threat that the Persian arrows will \\"blot out the sun\\" with the dry comment that that means the Spartans would fight in the shade.<br /><br />After watching 300, I looked up the Battle of Thermopylae on Wikipedia and found that history teachers and professors will definitely not be using it as a teaching tool.<br /><br />I also find myself wondering how the Iranian-American community and Iranians themselves will react to a film that casts them as something less than human.  I have a feeling some in the disabled activist community will also find the depiction of the Greek hunchback (who really did look like Gollum to me) as offensive as well.<br /><br />Bottom line:  300 was definitely watchable.  But I have a feeling that a movie that attempted to be more realistic would have been more gripping.
0962477060|5.0|I play a few instruments. Keyboards, woodwinds and stringed. I say, after all the smoke clears, and a person diddles and fiddles and finally works hard at attempting to play actual well-known tunes (which isn't straight-off for most) the basic chords and runs become boring. That's when we strive for more info....Mr. Edwards has attempted to bridge this obvious stage with the extended-the logical and theoretical-not a mean feat! Let's face it, no book is going to substitute for auditory experimentation, exploration and PRACTICE and too often, guys hit a wall after a few years and expect a book or someone or a new guitar or new widget, to magically transport their playing to new heights. WRONG. Practice more, study scales, arpeggios, and study some of the mystical mathematical reasoning why some things work and others don't. All in all, a couple of decades of playing later, we all run into those players who can't explain what they do or how they do it, but they do it better than anybody we've met so far. After playing for many years, try moving away from Western to Eastern forms or even music from Bali.....How important does Western theory play now? I disagree with all the whiners who've knocked this book in their reviews. They're just not \\"there\\" yet. This is a solidly intelligent book, a lot better than most I've read and worth looking at, not just for benchmarks but also as a sounding board to get clues and insight into your own composing habits.

B000J10EQU|4.0|What a pleasant surprise! I expected Brandon Routh and the rest of the cast to be doing imitations of their predecessors who starred in the 70's films. Not at all! Brandon plays a sensitive, strong and spiritual Superman who is quite distinctive from Reeve's boyish Man of Steel. Kate Bosworth holds her own against Margot Kidder's classic portrayal of Lois Lane. And, man what a Lex Luthor! Kevin Spacey is comic, but extremely cruel. He doesn't give one inch to Gene Hackman. The subplot about Lois' little boy is very well done. The classic musical themes from the 70's film will make you want to cry with nostalgia. Great special effects. One caveat: the film is over 2 1/2 hours long so watch it when you can devote sufficient time to it. One last word -- Marlon Brandon's Jor-el is seamlessly integrated into the film and it really works. Superman fans will love this film!
B00000JR2A|5.0|The Seeds of Love album was the long awaited return of TFF after a long hiatus after their biggest commercial record, Songs From the BIg Chair. It was a big departure from the heavily synth sound they had on their previous releases. It is definitely more guitar based and the songs are more toned down in the electro-synth sound that they are known for. <br /> There are only 8 tracks on this album due to the on going turmoil the band was going through at that time. Roland Orzabal was going through a period of his best work producing and maybe over producing the songs..and Curt Smith was just waiting and waiting. Curt`s contribution to this album was very small and left the band after the following tour of this album. <br /> Woman in Chains...Wow !!!  the best TFF song ever. Roland`s production  fairlighting is amazing. Just put on a set of headphones and this song will take you away into another realm. Oleta Adams..the female voice on this song is find Roland and Curt discovered in an Atlanta night club. She has since enjoyed a nice career of her own...remember \\"Get Here\\" the song that was heavily played for the troops by their wives in the first gulf war???  That was Oleta`s song. Also the beautiful fretless basswork of the great Pino Palladino gives this song a wonderful tone throughout (where`s Curt? ). <br /> Sowing the Seeds of Love is their most Sgt. Pepper sounding effort and is a great song in its own right. The rest of the tracks are all pretty good if you`re a TFF fan. Roland`s vocals are always great as always and Curt`s only song Advise for the Young at Heart is his last song to sing lead..from TFF. <br /> All these songs are accompanied with awesome videos..if you can get them, they are nice to add to your collection.
1558216847|1.0|I read 1/2 of this book and loved it. What an incredible adventure. <br /> <br />I then googled the author and found several stories, including a special BBC investigative piece, that showed evidence that the author completely fabricated the story. Polish soliders were given a general amnesty and released from gulags in order to assist the Russians in fighting the Germans. <br /> <br />Very dissapointing.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|This is the first John Mayer album I've ever purchased and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. This album is a perfect mix of rock, blues, and jazz. Joh Mayer proves with this album that he is here to stay. All of the tracks are about life, love, and heartache. The record definitely takes you on a journey from start to finish. Some tracks are better than others. However, John has developed a much more mature sound on this record than on previous songs. I'm proud to say that I'm now a dedicated Mayer fan and I can't wait to see what his next cd offers =) <br /> <br />Stand-out Tracks: <br /> <br />1. Vultures <br />2. I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You) <br />3. In Repair <br />4. Gravity <br />5. Belief
B00002SSKI|5.0|Was given this as a gift at Christmas and loved it so much I gave it to my 4 girlfriends at Valentines Day!
B000KX0IOK|4.0|This is ryan goslings greatest work by far. Watching this movie is like takeing the painful heartbreaking trip of additction yourself. Mr gosling pulls you into the film and won't let you go.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book just as much as the DVD.  It gives a person everything they need to create the life they want.  And that is happening to me on an even larger scale than I ever imagined.
0060730552|4.0|This was a great book to read as far as adventure goes, but not being that much of an experienced climber it was tough deciphering thru all the lingo and climber talk.  It did get me to buy the documentary that put a lot fo things into perspective.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is one of the best DVDs we own. We collect with a purpose. Learning for us is a thrill, and having subtitles that we can read allows us to understand, sing along, and deeply internalize messages. The Phantom of the Opera provides a magnificent tale of love, tragedy, and the perennial struggle between good and evil. A ghost terrorizes those that work or visit a French Opera House. But at the same time, this ghost tutors a chorus girl to sing like an angel. His angel of the night. By driving the leading soprano crazy, he is able to encourage that his protégé be center stage. And she renders a brilliant performance. Phantom loves her, but Christine does not return his affection. Falling in love with the Vicomte de Chagny, Christine breaks Phantom's heart. As we read the lyrics of each and every song... we are marveled at the magnificent story told through the most beautiful music ever. Do obtain this DVD and become... simply enchanted with the music of the night!
1573301051|5.0|When funding for school music classes were being cut all over the country people kind of brushed it off as a non-necessity.  Studies prooved that many kids prosper in other academic subjects when taking a music class.  Art should be available for all kids in school as well as sports.  This benefit concert brought awareness to that.  Mariah, Celine, Gloria & Shania all appeard to support the cause.  And of course Ms. Aretha Franklin.  The performnaces were great.  Carol King was brought out as a special guest of Celine Dion.  The best part of the show was when the diva's sang You've Got A Friend and Natural Woman.  This show sounds even better with the 5.1 sound.
1582701709|3.0|The DVD was featured on Vermonter dot com awhile ago and more or less was said to be taken with a grain of salt. After reading the book I came away with more or less the same conclusion. Some people will buy into this head over heels while others will think it's all new age bunk. I guess it all comes down to our own beliefs and lifestyles. I thought it was interesting but nothing I haven't heard or read about before. Maybe just a new way of presenting it.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Although I enjoy MCR's music, I admittedly get why some do not: The image and some song titles seem destined for a hot-topic crowd, and I was kind of burned out on these types of bands when the record was out. However, make no mistake: \\"Three Cheers\\" is one of the top albums of its genre. <br /> <br />Hooks are abundant on the release, and it's also got some creativity and verve in the tracks that keeps the listener wnating more. My favorites on here are \\"Prison,\\" \\"Ghost of You,\\" and \\"Jetset Life.\\" All of these songs are excellent and succeed at some of the fronts mentioned. \\"Prison\\" is a pretty unique track and kind of was a taste of what came later from the band. \\"Ghost\\" is them making a ballad and succeeding at it. It's such a beautiful track and the chord progression is awesome. It's basically flawless. \\"Jetset\\" is a pretty anthemic, heavier track on the album. <br /> <br />Then you get a lot of themes about gender-bending (\\"Give 'Em Hell\\"), and stuff like death on the record. But what could you expect out of guys inspired by the likes of Bowie and Queen, and generally labeled \\"emo-goth\\"? This would be a natural result. And more often than not, the tracks succeed on the album, and is actually worth repeat listens. <br /> <br />There are a couple of lowlights, however. In spite being their breakthrough hit, I actually find \\"I'm Not Okay\\" to be a bit annoying, and I'm also not a real big \\"Hang 'Em High\\" fan.  <br /> <br />Still, if you are willing to give this record a chance I think you'll find something to enjoy. Of course, a typical metalhead is going to dismiss anything under the band's name by principle, but this band is actually one of the better of its type.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris leads you through the possible effects of religious fanaticism.  The Abrahamic religions are the most violent mainstream religions on earth.  All of their holy books contain writings about genocide and murder.  The moderates in the religion make it easier for the fundamentalists to exist because they provide a mainstream \\"soft\\" view of the religion.  They give the fundamentalists credibility.  A small group of religious terrorists could spark an international conflict beyond anyone's imagination.  The book is a real eye opener.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Either you love it or hate it.  Its Jurassic and In-Your-Face!  Wide screen is great.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Daughter using the account again! <br /> <br />I'm VERY dissapointed with her music. I agree, she will lose her fans under 21, because it's practically a remake of L.A.M.B. except, she has tried to 1 up it, when the songs went WAY down. <br /> <br />Her only really good songs in my opinion are Wind it Up, The Sweet Escape, Early Winter, 4 in the Morning, and Yummy. <br /> <br /> <br />I wouldn't waste your money buying the CD though.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This movie is so cute, and I am glad to be able to share it with my children now! It works great and was shipped on time. Thank you!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre has held me spellbound! I have watched it over and over! The passion between Toby Stephen's Rochester and Ruth Wilson's Jane is so inspiring! It does not matter if they are beautiful or ugly! They are twin flames or twin souls! Their love transcends physical qualities! This version inspired me to reread the original novel which I can now say is my favorite novel. I have always liked the story but this version made it so real for me. I love Kimberly Bennett's sequel Jane Rochester also! I have even ordered the soundtrack for Jane Eyre the musical!  Toby Stephens should get an EMMY here in the STATES! I LOVE his Rochester. Only 2 other people have moved me to feel so deeply in the arts. They are GERARD BUtler in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and AXL ROSE in the GUNSNROSES video, NOVEMBER RAIN.
B000AWYOG4|5.0|this was a very good movie i would buy it any time plus it makes a great gift-the best!
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Somewhere I heard their track \\"Follow me into the dark\\" and the accoustic guitar caught my attention. I don't listen to the radio that much since I don't have a long commute - kitchen to office type thing. The other day I heard it again and this time I caught the name of the album - I'm notorious for not knowing the names of bands and this one zipped by me too. I know what I like and I know good music when I hear it. Frequently when I've bought a CD for one track I'm disappointed by the tone or quality of the rest ... but, not in this case. They have the quality of many of the bands from the 60s, but they are original and thoughtful in their writing. This record is relatively mellow, but it has as pleasant energy about it. Similar to another review here on Amazon, I'm interested in looking into their previous work and will look for new releases from them. If someones doesn't talk them out of their own style and will let them alone to continue to develop it, they'll be around for a long time I'm quite certain.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|this is not as good as dawn of the dead its more of a funny movie why dawn of the dead is more of a scary movie
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This was an excellent movie! There are few movies like this anymore. This movie does a wonderful job of telling the story of a man who had a dream and wouldn't let anything get in the way of his dream. Will Smith and his adorable (real life) son Jayden do an excellent job in this movie! It is truly an inspiration for anyone who has a dream! This is a wonderful movie for famlies, couples, and people of almost any age (young children may not understand the story). I highly recommend this movie!
B000MTDRKE|5.0|This is his best album!!! The music is fantastic! Finally he has shredding guitar. It adds to what I would say is one of the best prog albums I've ever heard. The lyrics are going to offend some people. You are buying a religious album!  He is not intentionally bashing any particular religion, you need to keep your ears open and listen to the complete message. But musicly, this album incorporates everything from metal, rock, classical, to easy listening. Great vocal performances that you have never heard from him, fueled by great music you've never heard from him. You need to buy this album!
B000NA28HU|1.0|I'm only about 20 minutes into the film and I can already safely say that this is by far the worst adaptaion of a novel into a film that I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.  Do yourself a favor and buy the novels..
B00062IVKS|3.0|Good movie ... unfortunately one of the many good movies brought to screen by hollywood but ruined with a script brimming with obscenities & filthy language.  Makes you sick - very annoying why a good story cannot be told in a manner that will allow you to enjoy it with kids & the entire family.  Now that requires a rare talent that big name hollywood directors are yet to master.  I may be wrong but to the best of my knowledge such obscenties & language would not be permitted in most american homes.  But maybe it is for film folks from Hollywood where broken marriages and dysfunctional familes are the norm. <br /> <br />Good Movie but I cannot allow such filth into my home ... <br />
B00000739S|3.0|Warning this overpriced import IS released domestically as Lou Reed Extended Versions.  This CD is the second half of the Rock N Roll Animal show but not as compelling.  Just friendly advice from one Lou Reed fan who paid $40.00 for an import when I walked in the next day into a gas station to see Lou Reed - Extended Versions took it home and found out the hard way it is the same exact CD...same master too!!  Buyer Beware hope you find this helpful.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Though who could stop at one after experiencing this joyful, funky, passionately spiritual music, played by the undisputed God of Reggae while at the peak of his powers? This is the 25th review of this disc here on Amazoon, and it's the 24th five-star review. Suffice to say, we ain't exaggeratin'.<br /><br />  Despite the liner notes' claim that this is a collection of tracks from shows in Paris, Copenhagen, London and Amsterdam, it is in fact entirely from the three Paris shows of the Kaya tour, on June 25, 26 and 27 of 1978, at the Pavillon Baltard in Nogent-sur-Marne. Summer in Paree!<br /><br />  A marvelous alchemy found in that magical city has created some of the greatest live shows ever recorded, not only in classical music but in artists as diverse as Marley, Bill Evans (Paris Concerts), and Genesis (the incomparable Seconds Out), to name a few of hundreds of incredible shows on disc and in the bootleg community. If it says Paris, give it a listen.<br /><br />  The Parisian vibe of elegant artistic mastery permeates this splendid display of the seductive groove and power of reggae music. Bob is in fine shape throughout, his voice clear and strong, his powers of musical hypnotism unsurpassed. Listen to the Wailers with and without Bob, and you quickly realize what a legendary spark this man carried. His deep belief in love as the ultimate power carries his music to heights most musicians don't even know exist. Marley had something to say, dammit, and he said it with unmatched passion and intensity, while still having and giving fun fun fun!! Not too much of that around anymore...<br /><br />  Bob's unique Rasta vibe permeates the album, which starts with his moving prayer to Jah and quickly segues into my favorite track, a perfectly jaunty Positive Vibration which has pulled me out of many a non-irie mood over the last 28 years. The crowd is in heaven, and shows it, and the mood throughout all the songs is powerfully uplifting.<br /><br />Babylon By Bus is a pure contact high of the very best kind!<br /><br />  By the way, this is what cds should be all about. The double record fits perfectly onto one disc, with excellent remastering that brings out the spirit of the music while avoiding the digital harshness that mars so many remasters. The vinyl already sounds perfect, fat and full of the Barrett brothers' insanely funky bass and drums, and the cd is, in its digital way, just as perfect, with the bonus of no track cuts. It sounds like one continuous show, featuring many of Bob's best tunes and a crowd like we rarely if ever feel these daze.<br /><br />  In my travels to various lands, I have found there are only two bands that everyone everywhere loves unreservedly: the Beatles and Bob Marley. Their messages speak to all people. Imagine that, folks just wanting to get along without wars and hatred and the \\"shitstem\\" that's killing our mother earth.<br /><br />  Imagine if Bob had lived...<br /><br />  When I spent time in Jamaica in the early 80s, Bob was already a deity. I was back on that gorgeous isle last month, and it looks like Bob is now God, period. His music and energy are omnipresent. His hymns to love and self-determination, and his desire to empower and unite his fractured brethren and indeed all people into a loving collective, guarantee that his songs will live for as long as people listen to music.<br /><br />  If you like this album, Bob has a vast catalogue starting with classic two-tone stuff in the sixties and then featuring the original Wailers, his seminal reggae group with Tosh and Bunny. There are plenty of jammin' shows in the online tape-trading community to be had from all periods, and Marley fans are, as expected, glad to share! That's what music is really all about, as Bob always pointed out: sharing the gift that life is. Please look around at various sites; seek and ye shall receive. The 1979 Santa Barbara dvd is also verrrrrry much worth finding; to see Marley in full flight is absolutely glorious and inspiring.<br /><br />  Bless you, Brother Bob. Your love and joy will resonate on this planet forever.joy will resonate on this planet forever.
0767805712|5.0|Gattacca tells the story of an \\"invalid\\"; a person in the distant future who was born without the perfect genetic profile that is required for certain jobs (in this case he wants to be an astronaut). In spite of his physical shortcomings, and the impossible finality of his station in life, he refuses to accept this as his destiny and embarks on a mission to beat the system that discriminates against him because of his limited genetic potential. Ultimately, through creativity, impossible will and sheer guts he realizes his singular dream.     Accompanied by a sometimes haunting score and the  kind of twilight cinematography that gives it a sometimes surreal atmosphere; Gattacca provides a nostalgio-atmospheric experience that gives a visceral tug to the unknown longings for time and places beyond our dreams. The lighting and photography, gives the appearance that the entire film is shot during twilight; even the scenees that take place during the day.     There is also a strong element of want and longing within the film; Vincent wants Irene; Jerome wants to maintain a comfortable lifestyle in spite of his disability; Vincent longs to become the astronaut that he has dreamed of;Anton longs to catch the murderer; Irene longs for companionship. Coupled with the mood of the film; these intersecting emotions provide a charismatic energy that will grab you until the very last scene.     --Ciao
B000002HEP|5.0|Ok, it's official. This is the best Kyuss album. No doubt about it. Josh Homme's low-tuned riffage, Scott Reeder's Geezer-ish bass lines and fills, Brant Bjork's energetic drumming, and the stoned voice of John Garcia all combine into one energetic groove of an album.<br /><br />From the opening notes of \\"Gardenia,\\" this album grabs you and never lets go. There are different atmospheres throughout the whole cd. With songs like \\"Supa Scoopa\\" and \\"Whitewater,\\" the feel is agressive, yet mellow too. Other songs like \\"Space Cadet\\" feels like a calm wind blowing by. Other tracks like \\"Conan Troutman\\" and \\"100o\\" are pure agression. Yet there is a cohesive flow to the whole record.<br /><br />While some people might complain about the album being tacked onto 3 tracks, I love it. I think that each part has a powerful beginning, a cool middle, and an explosive ending. It works on that behalf.<br /><br />So, if you're interested in entering the world of Kyuss, get this album, or their other masterpiece, Blues For The Red Sun. You can't lose.
1400079179|2.0|I'm not impressed at all.  This is mediocre suspense writing at best.  The constant and often totally unbelievable  cryptographic meanings hidden in paintings, poems, and architecture became very tiresome and, after 500 pages, it seemed the author had gone off the deep end, 'round the bend, and to the funny farm...and he never looked back.  I wish I'd just seen the movie; it reportedly sucked too, but it would've saved me time.  It gets two stars only because he successfully hoodwinked the American public.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|Here's a thought; if you're going to base a movie on a previously successful television series, why not make it actually resemble that series? Another thought: if you're going to cast Charlize Theron as the sexy heroine, why not make her look, oh, I don't know, sexy? She's running around in what looks like black long-underwear throughout the movie, and you really don't care. It doesn't look good on her, and she's acting like she's The Terminator. Problem is, she's a hundred and nothing and kicking the #### out of people twice her size. It's just not believable. At all. The characters are embarrassingly without character, and the story is horrifically without thought. And what a waste of Pete Postlethwaite's talents. I feel bad for him having gone from In The Name Of The Father to this...
B000301YY8|5.0|I really like this CD.  It has a very deep meaning in all of the songs, while also being extremely beautiful.
B000MTPAHW|2.0|Somewhere inside the overlong, 114-minute Bullitt there is a brisk 90-minute long film desperate to get out. But as it is, it's seriously overlong with nothing to sustain it. Many pointless scenes come and go with loads of long, indulgent tracking shots goose-up the running time. I almost nodded-off a few times, I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about regarding this film.<br /><br />The paper-thin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed (he's not actually killed until about an hour later though). A local politician (Robery Vaughn, who didn't really want to do the film) acts as the token bureaucrat, standing in the way of getting things done. But getting WHAT done exactly? In 114 minutes almost NOTHING happens in this damn movie! Instead of mystery, clues, police procedure, shoot-outs and problem-solving we're treated to scene after scene of...not much. Bullitt eats food at the hospital, he goes shopping for celery and TV dinners, he hangs around with his girlfriend (a completely pointless character played by Jaqueline Bissett) and sometimes takes a passing interest in the case. About 80-minutes into this bore he is FINALLY involved in a car chase (THE car chase that everyone raves about) that 'tears up' the streets of San Francisco.<br /><br />I don't understand why this film has so much adoration or why all the fans proclaim it's 'the original and best', 'the one that started it all' or any other generic soundbite you can think of. There were cop movies before this, there were car chases before this. What exactly is Bullitt credited with 'starting'?<br /><br />A sense of being cool, calm and collected doesn't turn water into wine. Bullitt is plain, repetitive, agonizingly slow and almost completely without a plot. Don't consider me a philistine or someone who has been brainwashed by the over-edited nature of modern films where we're guaranteed and explosion every five minutes. I appreciate films from all eras and from all backgrounds. But Bullitt is just way, way overrated certainly does not deserve the high regard it's been lauded with. A real disappointment.<br /><br />Aside from a few reeaally grainy shots, the HD DVD features a fine 1.85:1 1080p transfer with Dolby Digital Plus Mono sound. A fair amount of extras too.iate films from all eras and from all backgrounds. But Bullitt is just way, way overrated certainly does not deserve the high regard it's been lauded with.

0684833395|5.0|Great classic book and I think that all jr to high school kids need to read this book.  It is a little 'rough' for younger kids, but if they ar a bit more on the mature side for their age - READ IT....

The days are so much more pleasant with these thoughts in my mind. I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a lift. Is it a new method? Not at all, but I definitely knew that going in, its just a very easy inspirational message to understand and adapt to.

B00009W0WM|5.0|We all know Casablanca is one of the greatest movies of all time. I'm not going to waste your time discussing the film, because the film speaks for itself. However, I will tell you all about this spectacular DVD release. <br /> <br />For the past several years, Warner Bros. has been releasing spectacular multi-disc Special Editions of their classic films. Usually in 2-Disc sets, although occasionally, they go farther, such as the 4-Disc sets of Gone With The Wind and Ben-Hur, as well as the 2- and 3-Disc sets of The Wizard of Oz and the recent 3-Disc set of The Maltese Falcon. With hours of spectacular bonus features and digitally restored and remastered transfers, Warner Bros. is easily beating out most film companies in terms of consistently spectacular DVD releases, rivaled only by Criterion. (And most Warner Bros. DVDs won't cost you an arm and a leg like Criterion.) <br /> <br />That having been said, 2003's 2-Disc Special Edition of Casablanca is spectacular. The film itself has been nicely cleaned up and is presented in glorious black and white, with its soundtrack cleaned up and presented in all it's original mono glory. Disc 1 includes the film as well as the original 1943 theatrical trailer and its 50th Anniversary reissue trailer. Trailers are always a welcome inclusion, as it allows a peek at how films were promoted through the years. <br /> <br />Disc 2 contains some excellent bonus materials, as well. One glance and you might think it's really light. A gallery, some audio stuff, a couple of documentaries, a cartoon, and a TV show. But it's quality over quantity, and that's what matters. The \\"You Must Remember This\\" documentary will be familiar to pretty much anyone who owns a video of the movie from 1993 and later. This particular revision will most definitely be familiar to anyone who owns the 1998 Special Edition VHS. However, its inclusion was a natural choice, and the documentary is excellent. Although not very long, it's not fluffy at all. <br /><br />The best bonus by far is the feature-length documentary, Bacall On Bogart. Narrated by his wife, actress Lauren Bacall, the documentary delves into Bogey's life and his remarkable career, as well as his marriage to Bacall. Produced in 1988 for WNET television, and likely broadcast on PBS and similar stations, this documentary is informative, entertaining, and its inclusion on here warrants praise to Warner Bros. <br /> <br />Also a welcome inclusion, and one that had it NOT been included would make one go ''Er, what?'' is the 1995 cartoon parody tribute, Carrotblanca, starring Bugs Bunny as Rick. The cartoon is wacky and zany like your typical Looney Tunes cartoon, but does not disrespect Casablanca at all. It's a clever parody and tribute to a classic movie. <br /> <br />Also included are audio extras, such as scoring outtakes and a 1943 radio performance featuring Bogey, Bergman, and Paul Henried, the 1955 TV episode ''Who Holds Tomorrow'' from the TV series of Casablanca, deleted scenes and outtakes, a documentary ''The Children Remember'' which I have not viewed yet, and some other various bonus materials. All are welcome inclusions here. <br /> <br />It's been four years since this DVD was released - a century when you consider how DVD continues to grow and change and expand as a medium - yet this DVD outshines many of the DVD releases we see today. Warner Bros. may have started out releasing lukewarn DVD presentations of their classic movies, but they have since set the bar higher and higher for DVD releases. Casablanca's 2003 2-Disc Special Edition stands up to even the best of the \\"Special Edition\\" DVDs film studios crank out in 2007 and outshines most of them. And Warner Bros. continues to release more spectacular Special Editions every year. Praise to Warner Bros.
0345457684|1.0|Probably one of the most annoying sci-fi writers alive. <br /> <br />There ARE some good ideas here but the narrative is so cheese-ball in its attempt at trying to be Mickey Spillane-meets-William Gibson that I couldn't get past the first hundred or so pages. You could almost see Morgan pushing to get the cover blurbs he had in mind (\\"A new, stylish writer and the heir-apparent of Philip K. Dick and Neal Stephenson!!\\"). <br /> <br />If Morgan could turn down the faux over-the-top style and perhaps team up with another writer who could moderate his Bi-polar tendencies we could be looking at some good sci-fi here.
0740748475|5.0|This compendium reflects what I believe to be the best and most incisive cartoon characters ever created. That Bill Watterson chose to quit writing this wonderful series at a time when his powers were at their height displayed both courage and consideration and, while all of us Calvin and Hobbes fans would dearly have loved him to continue, what we have we will hold, pass on to our kids and our friends and enjoy their pleasure as much as our own.  <br /> <br />This is a massive work of pure genius and is presented beautifully. While it is not light in weight it is lightweight in humour and content, yet multi-layered, as all the best cartoons should be.  <br /> <br />Buying this on Amazon makes a lot of sense, as not only is it considerably less expensive than in the stores, but by doing so, one avoids the risk of damaging back or neck ligaments carrying it from the bookstore to the car.
B00005NRO3|3.0|Just as they did in the first film, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson have some witty, metacognitive fun with the conventions of the horror genre in this tale of survivors from the original \\"Scream\\" facing off against a copycat.  Points made include how African Americans are thought to have a more realistic responses to horror situations yet are always among the first characters to die, the need for sequels to be gorier than originals, and the commercialization and packaging of spectacular cases of real-world violence.  Unfortunately, the rule most effectively dramatized is the one that tells us that sequels are never as good as the original.  All of the wit is packed into the first 40% of the film.  By the time we get to the end, it has degenerated into a lot of running and stabbing and pointless plot twists.
0140277447|4.0|\\"The Rape of Nanking\\" is an investigative journalist's chilling indictment of Japanese soldiers and their shockingly inhumane atrocities--their pervasive traumatizing of both disarmed Chinese infantry and unarmed citizenry through repeated stabbing by bayonet, swift decapitation by sword, mass execution by shooting, gruesome dismemberment of genitalia, violent gang-raping of girls and women, inter alia--inflicted upon those hundreds of thousands of Chinese victims unfortunate enough to have remained in the city of Nanking at the time of siege by the Japanese army during December 1937, in the early days of World War II.  The unexpected heroes of the story are a handful of Europeans and Americans--a determined doctor, a courageous academic and, ironically, a compassionate Nazi leader--who each selflessly risked their own lives in spontaneously setting up a safety zone within the city to protect another few hundred thousand innocent Chinese citizens from the senseless killings, lootings and raping being perpetrated by Japanese military personnel. A tragic, disturbing and ironical postscript to the reporting is that the bright, hardworking, overachieving author herself prematurely ended her own life in 2004, in the middle of a promising career at the still youthful age of 36. <br /> <br />The significance of this well-written work is its popularization of an important historical event.  Upon publication of the book in 1997, details of the Nanking massacre, which had theretofore been underrepresented (or misrepresented) in the historical dialog throughout the Cold War years, became readily accessible to the non-academic American reader.  (Incidentally, this movement to unveil, educate and \\"come to grips with\\" controversial events of World War II resumes later this year with the anticipated release of the movie \\"Nanking,\\" directed by William Guttentag.)  A shortcoming of the book is the author's tendency, despite good intentions, to slip into a backward-looking victim-villain trap, siding with the victims (note:  the author's grandparents fled Nanking in the days prior to the Japanese invasion) and calling for an official apology and reparations for past wrongdoing from the presumed villains by complicity of inheritance, i.e., today's Japanese government.  In my opinion, a more productive, forward-looking stance would be to take a deliberately positive, inherently more healing approach--such as advocating cross-border educational exchange programs for Chinese and Japanese students to bridge the cultural gap--which would encourage friendship and cultural sensitivity and lay the groundwork for achieving a better understanding among nations in future generations.  Especially in light of the recent stirrings of potentially destabilizing nationalist re-armament in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere, our world needs more international cooperation and less accusatory finger-pointing. <br /> <br />Looking beyond the particulars of the Nanking massacre per se, it is interesting to ponder historical cause and effect:  If President Millard Fillmore in 1852, apparently \\"frustrated by Japan's refusal to open its ports to commerce,\\" had not dispatched Commander Perry to end Japan's isolation, Perry would not have landed in Tokyo Bay with \\"two metal-clad, steam-powered ships belching black smoke\\" and \\"decided to shock the Japanese into submission with a massive display of American military force.\\"  If Perry, flanked by \\"some sixty to seventy aggressive-looking men armed with swords and pistols,\\" had not so stunned the Japanese into acknowledging the superiority of American military technology, \\"humiliating this proud people and leaving a residue of fierce resentment,\\" would the Japanese \\"with astonishing rapidity . . . [have] hurled themselves into the modern age--scientifically, economically and militarily,\\" and, in 1876, \\"dispatched to Korea a naval force of two gunboats . . . and forced the Korean government to sign a treaty of commerce--a movehauntingly reminiscent of what Perry had forced on Japan\\"?   After Korea, Japan clashed with China, and, in due course, Nanking became enveloped in the aggression.  Taken in historical context, it is perhaps not so surprising that by the 1930s, Japan had followed the expansionist lead of Western nations (which by no means makes it right!), and soon thereafter the world was at war. . . .  Hopefully, we have all learned from past mistakes and will behave with more respect for one another and human life the next time around. <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|Good gift to give to someone who is into movies and collecting DVD's.  My husband ejoys action films, esp. war genres, so he was pleased with this gift.
B000067FP7|4.0|It seems that just about every good movie, turns out some how to be connected with Steven Spielberg.  Whether he produced it, directed it, or both.  In this case, Spielberg was the executive producer of this timeless, borderline classic.  Its moments of greatness, I believe are attributed to its clever, yet simple, portrayal of never before seen characters and there ability to make you laugh.  Point in case, being the magui and their transformation into the \\"gremlins\\".  Of course, everybody in the real world has heard of a \\"gremlin\\", but no one has ever seen one.  This is what I thought was a clever \\"fairy tale\\" who's roots were never really explained, until now.<br /><br />-Sir Josh
B000HIVO64|4.0|I had not thought about Beck since \\"Loser,\\" but a friend told me about the innovative packaging of this CD.  The booklet is simply a grid and inside is a fold-out page of stickers to create your own CD booklet.  Cool!  I was intrigued by this idea, so I gave The Information a spin on a listening station and heard a lot of stuff I would like to add to my music collection.  Funk, hip hop, some blues here, `80s synth rock there, a little gospel, a lot of soul, sound effects, experimental stuff, space themes--all types of styles that work well together.  I play this CD a lot and plan on buying another copy for a friend's birthday.  The CD includes a DVD that has full-length music videos for every track!  Wow!  Low budget stuff, as would be expected, but quite an undertaking!  The videos are all Beck lip-synching with different settings and his band (well they are credited as \\"players,\\" so I'm not sure if they are in his band) wearing all types of costumes from drag, military garb, spaceman outfits, teddy bear heads, etc.  You definitely get your money's worth here! My favorite videos are \\"Soldier Jane\\" and \\"New Round\\" (coincidentally, two of my favorite tracks as well).  The CD starts with the more accessible numbers (my favorites being \\"Strange Apparition,\\" \\"Soldier Jane,\\" and \\"New Round\\") and ends with more experimental stuff (my favorites being the title track and \\"Movie Theme\\"). <br /> <br />\\"Elevator Music\\" (3:38):  Funky beat, groovy baseline, rapping verses with a laid-back chorus and automated telephone sound effects. <br />\\"Think I'm in Love\\" (2:19):  Pleasant, accessible catchy track.  Beck's deadpan vocals work well on these laid-back numbers. <br />\\"Cellphone's Dead\\" (4:45):  The first of several tracks I consider a bit experimental, although this one is still accessible enough.  I like the opening beat.  It reminds me of experimental synth music of the early `80s.  Beck kicks in with fast rapping vocals.  Repetitive sound effects and voices with funky breaks give it an old school feel. <br />\\"Strange Apparition\\" (3:47):  My favorite!  Love the piano!  Catchy track that I like to listen to over and over.  Gives me the feel of an old-fashioned train ride for some reason (no train in the video, however).  Could be considered a gospel song. <br />\\"Soldier Jane\\" (3:59): My second favorite.  Another very pleasant, catchy track. <br /> <br />\\"Nausea\\" (2:53): Now we're getting funky!  Deliberate beats push the groove. <br />\\"New Round\\" (3:25): Quiet, laid-back song with transcending vocals.  Nice track to relax to and another of my favorites. <br />\\"Dark Star\\" (3:44):  Spoken word at the verses.  I really like the chorus.  Almost disco-era sounding synth effects and then a harmonica comes in. A lot going on here from many an old school. <br />\\"We Dance Alone\\" (3:56): More funky beats, spoken verses, and pleasant chorus. <br />\\"No Complaints\\" (3:00): Another favorite of mine.  Beefier baseline.  Very memorable, hum-along-to song. <br /> <br />\\"1000BPM\\" (2:28):  Strange track.  Old school hip hop with lots of repetition.  Beginning of several experimental tracks. <br />\\"Motorcade\\" (4:15): Another strange one with lots of sound effects.  I guess it has the feel of a motorcade--a quiet one anyway. <br />\\"The Information\\" (3:45): Crashes in with a cool beat.  A lot more accessible than the previous two tracks.   <br />\\"Movie Theme\\" (3:53): Nice opening organ line.  Quiet, relaxing, and transcending with outerspace sound effects. <br />\\"The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton\\" (10:36): Starts with experimental stuff and then returns to the beat from \\"Cellphone's Dead.\\"  Next (I guess, \\"Landslide\\") is a more accessible part with a pleasant, sing-along-to chorus.  Back to the \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" beat.  The final part is a quiet synth line with spoken word background that moves to the foreground about \\"space travel\\" which lasts several minutes.
B0007TKNII|3.0|This movie starts out great and meanders downhill.  The organ riffs near the beginning, as the dusty old theater magically reverts to its old gilded glory, are a KICK!  The scenes of dancers and choristers rehearsing, while scarves flow, gilded costumes flash, and scenery is moved by old wooden wheels - very cool.  Minnie Driver is a hoot as a temperamental opera singer.  Emmy Rossom is miked about half an inch from her lips - it's pure pop and not \\"real singing\\" - but she is pretty and even her singing is pretty.  But when Gerard Butler as the Phantom starts singing, and he abducts wide-eyed Emmy - watch out! The show is tanking.....  He takes her down to what looks like a cross between the cavern scenes in Pirates of the Caribbean and the canals of the Venetian casino in Las Vegas.  Yep, it's corn-Y!  and Butler's singing is awful.  He isn't even handsome.  WHY DID THEY CAST HIM?  Did he know somebody?  The show is CALLED The Phantom of the Opera and they put in a Phantom who can't sing.  He chews it all up....\\"Tennnnnderrrrr mommmmments....\\" <br />Get the hook!  With all that water, maybe Captain Hook?   <br />I recommend watching/listening to the first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie and then turning it off.
0060899220|5.0|I've never reviewed a book before, so don't look for any commentary on Anthony Bourdain's writing skill here - all I can say is that the book reads in the same way that Tony speaks on his TV shows - which I find highly amusing and entertaining.

Desde la musica hasta la direccion pasando por edicion y la forma en la que la emocion va creciendo. Tengo muy fresca la escena que comienza con el personaje de Chieko en la hamaca que termina en la discoteca donde se hace un uso del medio y una descripcion de sensaciones que raramente haya visto antes en una pelicula, en fin elegi describir esta escena pero pienso que la pelicula en su conjunto es una sensacion que los amantes del cine deberian vivir.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I purchased this CD based on The Black Parade single that I heard on the radio.  The entire album is excellent and well put together, with the circus parade theme running throught.  I am normally a hard-rock fan, so if you generally go for harder music, take a chance with this band, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00005JPG1|5.0|My biggest fear of watching this movie was that the ending would be left open, and nothing would be solved, since the case was never officially solved in real life. From start to finish, the movie kept my interest because the events unfolded at a perfect pace. Not too slow, not so fast that it skimmed, either. I highly recommend this movie for audiences young (young adult that it) and old. I'll be the first one in my local retailer to pick up the DVD release, and I pray for lots of bonus materials to shed further light on the case.
0671015206|5.0|The premise of the Millionaire Next Door is that long term wealth is more a function of cost than revenuve.  The author's study of millionaires in the US finds the key common feature amongst them is thrifty spending habits, not extravagenet buying.  As such, the book suggests things like:  Don't buy an expensive house (for yourself, or worse yet for your kids), don't buy expensive cars that depreciate, live well within your means...  An expense avoided is more important than a raise. <br /> <br />This book has two differences than many others in the genre:  First, the advice is based on original survey research, and second, it is not encouraging a \\"Cult of Personality\\" on the author.  The credibility and originality of the book sets it apart in a genre filled with self-promotion and garbage.

0553260111|4.0|\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is a good thriller that keeps you guessing what will happen next. The pace moves along nicely for the most part and keeps your interest up. The romantic subplot was a bit underdeveloped, or unnecessary, depending on how you see it. <br /> <br />Overall, definately a very good pick if you're looking for an entertaining thriller. This was my first Ludlum book but it will not be my last.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|By the ratings most people give here I guess I am NOT the only one who knows how great this album is. I do not think it is THE greatest live album, The Who Live at Leeds is in my opinion the best rock album live or studio. But that takes nothing away from this beautiful masterpeice. The ironic thing is I have never liked this genra of music. I never cared for Kiss, Nugent, AC/DC,Def Leppard,Van Halen, or hair metal, which it seems UFO helped pioneer. But there is something about this album that greatly exceeds expectations. The simple answer would seem to be Micheal Schenker. I am not a fan of his other projects, so it must be the sum of the whole band. The songs themselves stand on their own, but are sizzling in this live disc. It has the best collection of guitar solos that are not pretentious, but melodic, and keep with the song structure. I do feel the crowd noises are juiced up at times, and that can be a slight annoyance. I read it was supposedly done with no overdubs, but in \\"Only You Can Rock Me\\" Phil Mogg seems to sing over himself in the final chorus, so that is a dubious claim. I bought the album when it came out in my senior year, and my metal head bro-in-law bought me the CD 10 years later. It is the only one he ever gave me I kept.
B0002IU988|5.0|After purchasing this cd used a couple of years ago because I didn't want to get burned on another cd that was suppossed to be great with a new lead singer.  I was very surprised with this cd and after repeated listens it just got better and better.  It usually gets added to my mix when I do a MP3 mix for my car audio.  It's just one of those cd's that doesn't get tiring after a couple of listens like so many others do today.  It will intersting to see what their sophmore release will be like if they ever work through whatever problems that they've encountered since this release.  Time will tell.  If you haven't picked this up because Scott Stapp isn't singing lead on it then you're sorely missing out on some great music.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. <br />  30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. <br />  31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.  <br /> <br />I was one of the lucky ones that had my copy signed by Neal Morse straight from the record company, and the bible versus above he wrote on the front cover (acts 20:29-31) along with his signature. These passages, along with his liner notes in the cd booklet sum up what the subject matter is, which  is clearly detailing how the church \\"in the past\\" entered into a dark time, and how it was predicted by Jesus himself in the scriptures. This concerns the \\"whole\\" church, not just one denomination. The Catholic church being the largest and most prominent in the past (as it remains now)is simply the best example of the cds subject matter. To say that it is offending to one particular faith is like saying that snow is not white when it first falls to the ground. Do an internet search on google for \\"Sola Scriptura\\" and you will learn the history. Now on to the music. As other reviewers have said, this is simply a fantastic prog cd. It is far more progressive and driving than any of Neal's previous works even including Spock's Beard. It does have dark overtones for the first two thirds of the cd, but the last song \\"the conclusion\\" is as uplifting a song as Neal has ever penned. The addition of Paul Gilbert lends a metal feel of speed lead playing not heard on any previous cd's, and Mike Portnoy and Randy George are perfection on their instruments. As you listen to this release, there are many nods to the greats of prog music seasoned into the mix, Spock's Beard, Yes, Gentle Giant, and even a nod to 90's metal on the beginning of \\"The Conflict\\". Close your eyes and you will think you are listening to Soundgarden onthe verse and then Alice in Chains on the chorus. Overall this is splendid release, yes a bit more direct in subject matter, but in a historical perspective (yes, the cd is about history)it serves a purpose, as any history of anything or anybody does. This cd is not hateful, or anti-anything..it is history. If you are wondering why the 4 stars and not 5, it is simply due to, as another reviewer stated, that some themes and ideas are repeated from previous works. That would be my only negative though. This is a quality release by an unheralded Contemporary Christian Rock artist. Get this release, it is very worth the investment.
B000GIWS7E|4.0|Like Styx, how many live cd's do you as a band need to come out with.  The song selection on this DVD is different than the others so that makes it worth the money.  They bring some out from the vault, especially Raise the Knife from the Falling into Infinity sessions.  The addition of the orchestra on the second half is nothing special because so many other bands have done this.  Overall, I still like Live at Budokan the best.  But, like I always say it's just a metter of opinion.  If you're a Dream Theater fan then you probably already own this.  If you're still debating then don't wait anymore.  Great music from a great band.
0374105235|5.0|Ishmail Beah shines a spotlight on the effects of a war that many didn't know existed, but the type of which is all too common in the world today.  His heart breaking story is written in a simple, yet eloquent manner.  My only complaint is that the book ended too soon, as I wanted to know more about his journey to America.<br /><br />  From the simple joys of childhood, through the pain of losing his friends and family, to his descent into savagery and finally, his redemption, this is a book that is hard to put down.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|Let me begin by saying that this could have been the 3rd Tranatlantic cd because of the 4 song method, 3 long and 1 short.  But the overt theme of this cd wouldn't quite fit in with the other member's contributions.  I must say that by just listening to this cd without knowing anything about Neal and his previous work I believe the listener would be a little lost as far as the subject matter is concerned.  I have to wonder how many new converts Neal is actually getting in the Christian music world, albeit the Christian music stores (like Family Christian Bookstores - not even listed).  I know my friend had owned a Christian music store and I was the one who turned him onto Neal Morse.  So that makes me wonder how many Christian music stores are actually ordering Neal Morse and how many people are going to the Christian music store to buy this cd.  If everyone is like myself you're already a follower of Neal because of Spock's Beard & Transatlantic and those are the people buying his cd's.  Anyone that I've run into at church and asked them if they had heard of Neal Morse the answer is usually no.  With all that said the subject matter is what it is because Neal feels a need to bring a little light on past accomplishments of the mother church.  I've read the lyrics and I'm still trying to figure them all out because for me, they seem to be a little confusing and not the easiest to put all together.  The music is typical Neal Morse and has all the similarities of Spock's Beard and Transatlantic so I don't really think there's any new ground being broken here.  That's was always one of the things that I wondered when Neal broke off from Spock's Beard;  how he would approach each cd.  Basically Snow and Testimony are very similar in overall concept and musicial style.  I always call Snow the secular version of Testimony.  Regardless, the music is always good and no one on radio today can come close.  I don't think there's really anything that you say in a negative way here.  It just comes down to personal opinion.  For those that say Neal is bashing the catholic church;  well, just look at the history of that same church and all that they have done since Christ was here on earth.  Sometimes, the truth hurts and people would like to forget the church's history of murder and mayhem through the ages.  Unfortnately, that's a part of the church's past whether you agree or disagree.  Remember, Christ is the way to heaven and no one really knows who's right anyway because we're not there yet.  So, kick back and enjoy some great music.ere.  It just comes down to personal opinion.

B000M4RG42|5.0|As a World War II student, I found this movie quite accurate.  If you are looking for \\"the battle of Iwo Jima\\", this is not it. This movie covers the time frame the flag raisers were on the island and the memories they accumulated. An excellent movie, I look forward to the companion movie.
B000MVQ9P2|4.0|It is a monster movie! (\\"Han River, Family, and... Monster\\" is the title.) The monster steals a single man's daughter and the whole family evades the authorities and battles the monster in an attempt to get her back. Warm up a dried squid and enjoy the movie! You'll feel just like you're on the banks of the Han.
B000MVQ9P2|4.0|This movie is directed by an incredibly talented Mr. Bong Junho (He directed a memory of murders, a great serial killer film). I don't want to reveal too much of story for those who will watch this movie. Simply put, it is a monster movie which is well made in many aspects. First of all, they did a quality job with CG in creating a monster which absolutely looks alive and disgusting as hell. Some of the best actors in S. Korea are playing in this film and they surely did a great job to make the movie real. Mr. Bong's style is that he always adds some comical essences to a serious and intense story. In 'The Host', you will be screaming at one time and laughing out loud at the other time. I don't know if this is a great monster movie ever or something. I am not sure and I don't care.  This film is very likable. Ah, this is a story about family who loves each other. Isn't that sweet?
B000MKD9P6|2.0|This is the first movie I downloaded via the new UnBox service. <br /> <br />I really wanted to like this movie. But I'm hard of hearing, and the UnBox service did not provide closed-captioning. Meryl Streep talks so softly throughout the movie that I could not understand 90% of what she said. So a movie that probably ought to get 3-4 stars gets only 2. <br /> <br />It's not the movie. It's the UnBox.

B000056VJ7|5.0|Neither Jim Steinman nor Meat Loaf have ever been better than on this album. From the first time I heard the first notes of the opening track, I knew I was hearing something special, something that reached for the universal. Something that dared to live, ferociously. <br /> <br />\\"Bat I\\" is without a doubt the finest of the three \\"Bat\\" albums, achieving much more than its predecessors in 25 less minutes. It was completely plugged into the melodramatic teenage energy that presumably set Steinman on this path in the first place, and that is why it continues to rock new listeners.

B000FQ4M58|3.0|When I heard the title track, I cringed and tried to forget it. But Marvin Aday always deserves a second chance, so I threw this sucker in the player and let the laser tell the tale. <br /> <br />It's definitely the ballsiest album Meat's done since \\"Bat II.\\" Like that album, it is missing the E Street Band flavored, horny 60's pop of \\"Bat I,\\" trading it for ponderous power balladry. Production-wise, it certainly sounds crisper and cleaner than \\"Bat II.\\" Thankfully, there are no Bova instrumentals. <br /> <br />The non-Steinman songs are tolerable overall. Diane Warren's \\"Cry Over Me\\" doesn't do much for me, and falls flat on the unimaginative chorus. Desmond Child's songs do a serviceable job of reaching for Steinman's level, if not quite making it. <br /> <br />The album definitely peaks with \\"In the Land of the Pig, The Butcher is King,\\" which is the monster Nikki Six and the dude from Marilyn Manson wish they could have created with the title track. It was written by Steinman, naturally. This song, and the other Steinman compositions, are worth the price.

1577314808|5.0|In \\"The Power of Now\\", Eckhart Tolle writes deeply, provocatively and powerfully about the importance of living in the present moment.  He shows us how our thoughts about the past and the future rob us of the present and all that is happening within us and around us.  I couldn't put the book down. I found myself reading and re-reading words and sentences as they enlivened that energy and truth that resides within.  I also found myself underlining sentence after sentence.  I plan to read this one again and again.  I can honestly say that my life has been radically changed already.  Although I'm new to this concept of living in the now, the concept is not new. It was taught by all the wise teachers of the past including Buddha and Jesus Christ.  Eckhart Tolle tells us about it wisely and masterfully and manages to talk about the power of the present moment in a way that makes it new and fresh and within the grasp of all who are ready.

B00000IQW5|4.0|Wonderful movie.  Great flying scenes and a love story the ladies will love!
B0000027D5|5.0|When \\"Lotus\\" was originally released as a vinyl Japanese-only import (1974), it was one of the most prized items among collectors. The packaging...nowhere near as important as the music itself...was a mind-blowing example of innovation and creativity with several fold-out posters and the sleeve that housed the three discs inside. That's one of the things that delayed the release of \\"Lotus\\" on CD for so many years...shrinking all of that wonder down into a 4.75\\" x 4.75\\" plastic box. They DID it...maybe not as spectacularly as the original 12 x 12 release...but it was magnificent packaging for what is basically Carlos Santana's \\"A Love Supreme.\\" Seriously...if you like the pop stuff, more power to you. There's plenty of good stuff there. But this was the top of Santana's spiritual / fusion era. In 1973 he added \\"Devadip\\" to his name, which meant \\"the light of the lamp of the Supreme.\\" That light burns brightly across \\"Lotus,\\" especially on CD 2 (where most of the extended numbers reside, including the 15 minute \\"Incident at Neshabur\\"). As Santana fans know, there are \\"several different Santanas.\\" This was the MILES Santana, the COLTRANE Santana. This is scary and amazing music played with so much mind-numbing passion that you have to wonder why there are people who don't \\"get\\" Santana. Get Lotus, and strap yourself in for one heck of a ride.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|I read this bbok because my sister told me to. She said it was amazing so I figured I would try it. I loved it, the first chapter is a bit graphic, but in needed way to add to the rape. The viewpoints are very unique and I love how its true to the way families deal with that sort of an issue. Instead of sticking together as a family they gradually break away. Its a must read on my account and I can't wait for the movie.
B00008O89K|5.0|If you've seen the movie then you know the music, if you havn't seen the movie... then why the heck are you looking at the soundtrack??? All and all, if you just want good instrumental! Then Boom! There You Go!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|Her first CD set such a high standard, not even NJ can reach it.  This CD is ok.  I can listen, but it's disappointing.
B000002KNY|5.0|David Byrne always passes off the \\"Fear\\" angle/theme here as a joke -- but I don't buy it.  These songs are anxious, clautrophobic, and twisted -- and legitimately so to my ears. They're also poppy as a laundry basket full of poppyseed muffins, and this aural culture clash has been known to lead to vertigo -- don't look down....
B000065BPB|5.0|I got these so I could listen to television or videos after everyone went to bed. I am very happy with them. The bonus is that my husband loves them. He's the kind of guy who is soooo picky about sound. (As in he hears variances in the sound that I don't..very keen ear, a musician). He is very satisfied and although I didn't buy them for him, I am very happy with the sound and fit and that he loves them. No problems anywhere. Great buy for the money.
0141439661|4.0|Though not considered to be her best work, Austen's Sense and Sensibility is definitely my favorite. The novel tells the tale of two sisters: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Having been left nearly penniless after the death of their father, the Dashwood family moves to a small cottage in the country. Elinor, the more sensible of the two sisters, is concerned with keeping up appearances and not letting her feelings for the object of her affections, Edwards Ferrars, be known. Marianne on the other hand, is the more flighty of the two. She wears her heart on her sleeve, a heart that beats for the charming and alluring Mr. Willoughby. The two sisters struggle with their own love affairs and their social standing in what I would call Austen's finest work.<br /><br />I know I go against the majority when I say I prefer this novel to Pride and Prejudice, but I do. Elinor and Marianne are much softer, more endearing characters than the Elizabeth and Jane Bennett. While the plots are similar, I would say that Sense and Sensibility reveals more about the main characters - their emotions, thoughts, etc. - than Pride and Prejudice does with its main characters.<br /><br />Either way, I adore this novel. If you have never read Austen, I definitely recommend starting with Sense and Sensibility.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a wonderful book.  It is a coming of age book but this coming of age is in the future.  It can get us to look at our own choices for our careers and family.  I participated in an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute were we discussed those topics in relation to this book.  My mother was a bookkeeper so I went into accounting.  Maybe this world of the future in The Giver is not far from our own world.  A good book to discuss with your teenagers.
B00005JKHP|3.0|After a nice long break from not being seen on TV, the original Star Trek crew made their return in this film, nicely titled \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\". All the original crew members were back to their regular roles that we remember them in.<br /><br />The story for our Starfleet explorers in this movie, focuses around an unknown space probe that is destroying countless starships and spacestations and ignoring all communications for peace. It is up to the now Admiral James T Kirk and his faithful crew on the Starship Enterprise to see if they can make peace with this probe before it destroys all humanity.<br /><br />There are a lot of problems with this film, but there are also a lot of good things about it too.<br /><br />The good would included:<br /><br />The special effects are quite impresive for the time period it was done in and this movie truly revitalized the Star Trek series from the void it had been in since the series was canceled in the 1960's. The story was typical fashion of one of the TV episodes with a nice twist to what the probe turned out to be. Probably exactly what Gene Rodenberry had in mind when he first came up with the Star Trek series. And for the most part it is a very deep and thought provoking film that is found here. But that is not to say it isn't without it's problems as stated above.<br /><br />The problems in this film include:<br /><br />Very long periods of filler. There are scenes that seem to go on forever that shows a shuttlecrafts approach to the Enterprise and a just as long approach to the main enemey of this movie, V'ger inside of it's cloud cover there is just as long a approach to the core of it. These moments slow the movie down to almost sleep enducing stand stills. The acting is a bit off par with Shattner really hamming it up. Delivering such a classic line as \\"Damn it Bones! I need you!\\" holding his hand out to his doctor friend and looking as if he is auditioning for a bad play. And lastly the film is just boring at points. It was missing that extra zing and zoom that the series and some of the later movies would deliver on. The soundtrack also is blaring and annoying at points. The music really just seemed to be out of place with weird techno like sounds just being pumped out of the speakers at points during long special effect showing off periods. The film needed a lot of cutting and editing rather then more additions like this version supplies us with.<br /><br />This is not a bashing review by any means as any Trek fan should appreciate this film for what it is. A nice revival to the series that had some good elements and did have a fun twist on things when we finally learn what the cause of all the problems truly was. But besides a few fun moments the movie isn't as stellar as it really should have and could have been. Its a great start and they would learn a lot from this film but I can't place it as a great film as honestly it just isn't when you compare it to the future editions that would follow. It wouldn't be a fair review to just say its Star Trek so it has to be good.<br /><br />The special edition does improve the otherwise average film greatly. The picture quality is improved as are some of the long drawn out moments that seemed to be put together better in this new version. But when you look through all the little add ons and clean ups, it really is still the same not so awesome film that it always was. A better version now but still has a lot of catching up to do when you look at the even numbered gems in the original movie series that still put this version to shame.<br /><br />The best way to go into this film is with a very open mind. The elements that worked do so very well and you can almost see the ideas that Gene was trying to show in this film. The moments that don't work and are drawn out and boring at points, well thats what the Fast Forward button on the DVD player is for. I think just seeing the ol' crew back together interacting and dealingwith the same outer space problems as we always saw them dealing with was reason alone to get this movie and for that it is mission accomplished. For being a movie that all fans of Star Trek and who aren't into the series can truly enjoy, well this movie won't reach that mark as those who aren't into the series may have trouble with this one. Still a great start to what became a great movie series of films with our old favorites.<br /><br />Check this one out if you saw the original film and don't remember it, this special edition is a nice way to relive it once again.eracting and dealing with the same outer space problems as we always saw them dealing with was reason alone to get this movie and for that it is mission accomplished.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|Excellent vocals in this second concert of these very talented women. <br />It's a great viewing with marvelous visuals.
B000002AHM|4.0|The musicianship here is very professional and enjoyable - this is the only documented audio of these three guitar giants working together in concert. The performance was recorded live in December 1980, at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco. Track #5 is a studio recording, though, but nonetheless coherent and of spectacular quality in both sound and performance.<br />Throughout the album, all three guitar players (incidentally only playing in pairs on the first three tracks) perform on acoustic guitars, and for an early 80's live recording, the sound quality is surprisingly good (rich acoustics, no feedback, no distortion.) What ruins a lot of the listening experience, however, are the audience members who yell and scream and whistle and clap over some of the music as if they were high on all that currently is illegal to get high on. The wildness of the audience participation on track #2 is especially bothersome; as soon as the guitar players play a fast lick, an unusual effect, anything technically advanced or anything in unison, these people go crazy, and when recognizing an obvious installment of the theme from Pink Panther you can hear them wearing their anuses on their sleeves as they burst from rapture.<br />But the audience aside, this is an important recording for a lot of obvious reasons - a recording that you definitely should own or at least listen to if you have ever enjoyed any music performed or written by any of these three guitarists. Incidentally, Hal Leonard has produced a book of transcriptions of all titles from this recording.
B000002L42|4.0|As a longstanding, very enthuasiastic fan, I really enjoyed the re-arrangements of the songs - Reeling In The Years comes to mind right away, with nice substitute chords, horn arrangement, etc.  The extra lyrics and great feel of Third World Man were very enjoyable, as was the beautiful guitar solo by Drew Zingg. <br /> <br />It also doesn't hurt to have Dennis Chambers, nearly the best drummer on the planet.   <br /> <br />Even Walter's tune sounded good.  True, as a singer, he's an excellent... oh, wait, his guitar solos aren't too good either.  Every time one of his solos come up, I just want to turn the volume down or \\"fast forward\\".  But he'll always be there, because he can't get fired!  What a great job to have.  And no one will tell him, because I'm sure he's surrounded by sycophants.  He's the only reason I'm docking this excellent CD one star.  What a shame they didn't record the band when Wayne Krantz was playing. <br /> <br />It was great to hear Donald Fagen in excellent form.  What a great singer and writer.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|To say 'Boston' was unique, influential, and ahead of their time, is an understatement. Case in point- after I graduated high school around the time 'Dont Look Back' came out, my best friend and I decided to take our 'dream trip' to Europe for 6 weeks, where we backpacked the continent on foot by day, and slept on trains and ferry boats during the nights. Almost everywhere we went... clubs, pubs, beaches, brothels (LOL!), music stores, outdoor wine fairs, the inside of taxis, etc. ... we heard the first 2 Boston albums being played in so many cases! In Greece, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, etc.! It was uncanny, really, we thought. 'Boston' was such a popular rock band, and not only in America. Their 'reach' was worldwide within a few short months! How many bands can claim this?     R.I.P. Brad Delp, and THANK YOU for some of the best, heartfelt, good time rock EVER!!!
B000002KXV|5.0|Rarely could a claim be made that the 50's, with its banal material appeal and cookie cutter lifestyle manifesto, be considered a colorful decade. Ah, but we had no colorist like Donald Fagen. Regardless of where Fagen finds himself he can swipe a bright red on the most drab of grays.<br /><br />\\"I.G.Y.\\" won one of the first MTV music awards. Not bad for an \\"art\\" artist who openly disdains flash such as the video network. With Fagen's knack for invigorating stage characters, artfully tying a nice musical bow through threading a concept among a series of songs, no medium could overlook the appeal of \\" The Nightfly\\", offered in an era where thought was not part of the musical equation.<br /><br />Fagen cannot be suppressed. His contribution to Steely Dan is evident with this first solo outing, evident that Fagen is a genius at crafting songs that play like events, scenes from a production, all coming together for a satisfying conclusion. Children of the 1950s had to plumb the depths of their creativity to produce images beyond \\" Leave It to Beaver\\". No problem for Don Fagen. Always with an eye on the future, Fagen revisits his childhood fantasies about how the events predicted might play out in an imagined adulthood. Hindsight lends these songs even more flavor as \\" The New Frontier\\" is explored for glimmers of light amid dire prophesies. Eternally romantic ( in a skewed sense), Fagen croons away about the love interests that pepper the journey, most poetically on \\"Maxine\\".<br /><br />Twenty five years on this music stands up as a timeless slice of Americana, Fagen style.
B000083C49|5.0|In a way this was the end of a great story arc. Much like Return of the Jedi ends a trilogy, Star Trek Part IV ends a trilogy of sorts that started in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. And boy does it end it in style and brilliance.<br /><br />Our favorite Star Trek officers lead by Admiral James T Kirk, Captain Spock and Dr. McCoy have to face a pending court marshal for their stealing of and destruction of the Enterprise when we last left them. On route back to Earth with the crew in a borrowed Klingon warship, they are alerted to a problem that the blue planet is facing. A strange alien probe approaches Earth sending out weird sounds as if it is awaiting an answer to something. The probe has energy draining effects making all starships and space stations powerless as the probe orbits the planet. Our favorite Starfleet crew figure out that it is the sound of a humpback whale that the probe is looking for and unfortunatly for 23rd Century Earth, the whales are long extinct. Meaning the planet will be too if they don't find a way to get the whales to answer the probes calls.<br /><br />Kirk and crew decide that it is up to them to retrieve whales from Earth's past in the hopes to save their present. They slingshot around the Sun and wind up back in 1986 Earth and have a limited amount of time to bring back a pair of whales, fix the power crystals that power the Klingon ship and even rescue one of their own who gets captured while they are sneaking around.<br /><br />This movie is a real joy to watch everytime. Probably one of the best films ever made that has the Star Trek title attached to it. The film is very light hearted and very humorous, taking a drastic change from Part III before it. There are many classic moments found and as time moves past the 80's this film just seems more and more nostalgic and creative.<br /><br />Moments like Spock dealing with a punk listening to loud music and using the neck pinch to knock him out cold. The crew dealing with the curse words that people spoke with in the 80's. McCoy in a modern day hospital dealing with the primative medicine techniques that people of the 80's did compared to his knowledge. And on and on.. there is no slow moments found in this film. Some of the other Star Trek films have moments that come to a crawl or just seemed to be silly and ridiculous at best. Every moment of this movie comes off as either, creative, funny or enjoyable.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is the fact that any person can jump right into it and follow along. Even those who aren't into Star Trek can watch this movie and see it as just a time travel story dealing with some future space explorers dealing with an 80's society. And those who are into Star Trek will love how the characters were used in this movie as all of them finally get moments to shine, where as in the past it was mostly about Kirk or Spock getting all the screen time. And for a change the acting was great. They weren't over doing their roles but were just acting natural. Finally everything just came into place with this movie. The right script, the right characters, the right acting and the right feel.<br /><br />The only downsides I would mention is that the music really is a minor part of the film. It isn't as stong a soundtrack that we find previously. Also the forced love story with a women who is a whale expert that Kirk meets in the past could have been handled better. The whale story even can be seen as a bit silly as well but the reason for them going to the past wasn't really important, just getting them into the past to interact was what this movie's goal was and it accomplishes that perfectly and then some.<br /><br />This is easily my favorite of the Star Trek films and especially with this special edition version that has a few extras like interviews and commentary now is the time to relive the fun and magic again that is found here. Some fans may not like that it is not the serious, Trek like situation thatyou found in the three films that came before this one. But I look at the big picture, that a film like this is enjoyable for more reasons then just appealing to Trekies, but that fans who weren't into the series can get into it through a film like this and learn about the characters they are enjoying.<br /><br />I really can't recomened this film enough. I enjoy it every single time I watch it and will probably always hold it in high regard and as one of the best. If you haven't seen this movie in awhile now is the time to relive the magic again with the special edition version.situation that you found in the three films that came before this one.

B000002U9W|2.0|I am a Pink Floyd fan, but not in their early days.  This album is highly rated by many people, maybe I am missing something but I just don't like it. I can listen to the title track but I call it \\"The poor man Echoes\\" <br />\\"If\\" is a nice ballad. \\"Summer of '68\\" and \\"Fat old sun\\" are very poor. <br />\\"Alan Psychedelic breakfast\\" is just ok but half of the song is just sound effect....for early days fans of the 60's and die hard fans !

0670034711|5.0|I am not quite finished with this book, but am so happy I made the purchase.  I have thoroughly enjoyed sharing the journey chronicled by the author.  The honesty in her writing is a refreshing change.  She literally bares her soul for all to see.  She not only documents the triumphs of reaching her goals, but also the struggles she endured along the way.
B000007638|5.0|Paul McCartney andhis post-Beatles trifecta Wings truly hit their zenith during their 1976 tour. Appearing onstage for the first time in 10 years, Paul went on the road with the best lineup the ever changing group ever had, a four piece team of crack musicians (including know mainstays Denny Laine and his late wife Linda) and a renewed sense of energy that allowed Paul to reconnect with his fans in a great manner.<br /><br />\\"Wings Over America\\" was the tremendously successful album the band released to commemorate the tour. Without question, it's one of the best live albms ever. From the opening medley of \\"Venus & Mars\\", \\"Rock Show\\" and \\"Jet\\" to the closing \\"Soily\\", this album is full of life and energy that only Paul can proivde. He rocks out on \\"Lady Madonna\\",\\"Live And Let Die\\", \\"Listen To What The Man Said\\" and \\"Silly Love Songs\\", shows his tender side on \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" (this version was a hit single) and \\"My Love\\", and relaxes and lets loose on a fantastic acoustic set that includes great versions of \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" and \\"Yesterday\\".<br /><br />The rest of the band is ace. Denny Laine and Jimmy McCulloch are equally gifted and talented axemen, and they provide some great guitar work here, especially on \\"Let Me Roll It\\". Linda is in fine form and is nowhere near as bad as just about veryone has made her out to be. Joe English rocks out on drums, and the accompanying horn section add an extra punch to the performed songs.<br /><br />Though Paul has released superior live albums as a solo artist (\\"Tripping The Live Fantastic\\", \\"Paul Is Live\\", \\"Back In The U.S.\\"), to hear Wings in their peak, this is the only official documentation of just how great they were, and it's worth evey penny.
B000002LCE|2.0|Listeners:<br /><br />  Don't get taken away by all the hype surrounding this album.  \\"All The Fools Sailed Away\\" is an OK ballad.  The pop sound of this album is nowhere near Dio's best.  For new listeners, I'd recommend Holy Diver, Last In Line, and Lock Up the Wolves, which are all hard-core Dio albums.
1582701709|1.0|They made this book and left it hanging so to speak knowing full well that one must be in line with God.  Which in a sense just means that all of this is just concepts and ideas someone thinks is ok but the truth is is it of God.  Reading the Bible which is the Will of God is how one really gets and moves in life.  If we believe in God or His son then we are done with law like at time of Moses.  During that time people had to bring a sacrifice to be cleansed of sins and trangressions but not really forgiven.  Once they brought the sacrifice to the high priest that man had to be cleansed to and then the person was given a blessing.  Today, because of a new covenant which is those of us who believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior we are under Grace.  It is because of Him that now we have favor of God and He freely gives Blessings.  This Secret is sneaky and dishonest because God never holds back anything that He wants people to know.  Bible instructs us to ask for wisdom, insight, knowledge and understanding of His ways.  Secret tells a psych concept to positive feelings and tells a a distorted concept on how to get something in life when all the while all we really need to do is turn our lives over to the care and will of God and read the Word the Bible the will of God, pray, seek Him and meditate on the Word of God.  The secret drops the ball so to speak because it doesnt follow through it leaves on hanging in air for whatevers.  bible is truth and gives the complete direction and guidance of what one is to do.  another thought here to bring up is James Ray and how he used the Native AMerican sweat lodge down in AZ to speak and make money off many people coming to it to hear this kinda stuff.  Many people died in that lodge because of not really paying attention to the needs of people and using a custom of the First Nations when it should never have been done like that.  If this entire situation was truly Spiritual then all would be in harmony and blessed.  However, many got hurt and death happened over stupid teachings.  I use to use the Secret in my Mental Health Therapy and Addictions Counseling teachings including the other silly stuff called Sedona Method and it is just blah blah.  The only true way to change is through Christ the Lord and Savior and the only way to true recovery is by in Step 3 turning our selves over to HIM and off our ways.  God's ways are not mans ways.
B00009Z574|2.0|I am a huge yes fan but this one is one of their weakest effort. <br />Hard to believe it has been done just a year after \\"Going for the One\\" <br />\\"One the silent wings of freedom\\" is a good track. The only other good tracks are \\"Onward\\" (the live version on Keys to ascension is better) <br />and \\"Future times-Rejoice\\" <br />\\"Don't kill the whale\\", \\"Madrigal\\", \\"Arriving UFO\\", and \\"Circus of heaven\\" are horrible. <br />A dark period in the band's history.
B0009SOFGI|4.0|The Stooges first album is, in many ways, indicative of bone-headed genius and a lack of preparation. The first half of the album (save for the interminable \\"We Will Fall\\") is impeccable. Anger at spirit-crushing boredom is the primary force that drives these tracks. It's \\"1969\\": 'another year with nothing to do'. As such, it's \\"No Fun.\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" shows how bored and willing these guys were. Plus, it's got sleigh bells and fuzz-wah all in one, so it's marvellous track. Lyrical content aside, the aggression in the guitar work is incredible. <br /> <br />The second half functions as one huge dry-spot. The liner notes tell us how most of these tracks were cooked up as filler. Did the band actually think they could take their well-written songs and stretch them to ridiculous lengths? As such, these hastily-written compositions are rather monotonous musically. Lyrically, they're beyond dumb. The utter simplicity suggests not genius but lack of preparation. Still, their presence and sound do present a continuity with the earlier tracks.  <br /> <br />This re-issue tacks on a CD full of alternate mixes, alternate vocal takes and alternate versions. The first few are the original John Cale mixes. These sound like they were recorded in an outhouse. It's a good thing Iggy remixed the album, because Cale's mixes bury and smother the finer points of the anger. The next few tracks have alternate vocals. They're alright, not too grand, but not too different. Lastly, extended versions. They're pretty good. <br /> <br />So how do I rate the album? Overall, it maintains a pretty concise sound. The rage and the boredom pervades, as does the rollicking guitar work. There are weak patches, to be sure, but the album ends up being a very cohesive beast. The bonus disc is just gravy. Sure, we just hear the same songs over and over, but it works well. The fact that its not tacked onto the first disc ensures that you get a solid listening experience if you only stick to the first album. As such, I'm giving the album four stars: Great, but with weak spots.
B000KRNCYY|3.0|My husband was slightly disappointed with this CD as it doesn't contain many of his favorite songs from the DVD.

B00008G9JM|5.0|There comes a time when artistic favours are granted selling artists by their record companies and by fans who savor with patience the great expectations they anticipate by some of their musical heroes.<br /><br />a Passion Play, an extremely sophisticated rock musical statement for it's day was one of those albums that critics despised but fans loved.<br /><br />There is no excess as each note flows seamlessly into the next..taken as a whole, as intended to be, The Passion Play, coming after thick As A Brick Ian Anderson explains in this really great remaster was to be an \\"similarly upbeat concept album\\" that turned he explains into a \\"darker set of tunes\\".<br /><br />The darkness fuses into lightness, as does lightness into dark throughout the CD,as the seriousness of the subject matter of repentance hearkens back to the unconscious fantasy world (see the attached video selection) meanderings as in  the \\"story Of The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" that then pushes forward into familiar Tull styles of jazzy soundscapes, brilliant accoustic sections of guitar and flute,as well as fierce (and to my ears) some of the most tuneful hard hitting music Tull recorded as  evident as on the \\"Summoned by name I am/the overseer section on Part 2.<br /><br />Intellectual musings aside, one is advised if interested to research for historical background purposes the original Passion Play and it's controveries that graced European playhouses at the time and for a more serious study look into the poetry of Goethe and Schiller as to their takes on the introvert and extrovert, the basic theme of The Passion Play and the reconciliation and balance of the two....anyway, this \\"Faustian\\" as ever Passion Play goes on and the steady mix of classical folk, gorgeous melody, fierce rock hooks makes this concept one song album, one eclectic piece of music that seams together into a whole quite nicely. A rare gem.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|As many reviewers have said before me, Scorsese is indeed one of the great directors of our time. With his adaption of the Hong Kong film \\"Infernal Affairs\\", he once again delivers a solid and entertaining story from a world of gangsters and thugs.  <br /> <br />You probably read a summary of the story, so I won't bother you with that. The story progresses in pretty much the same way as \\"Infernal Affairs\\", adding a few elements here and subtracting a few there to make it fit it's new surroundings. The cinematography is, of course, very well. It is very well directed and well edited. Some people have complained that the pacing of the film is too slow. I can't agree really with that. The build-up is necessary to fully apreciate the actions and emotions of the characters later on in the film and it never gets boring seeing that there's always tension and always many things going on at the same time. Also the cast (superstar or not) delivers good performances throughout the film. Especially I think, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon act their parts particularly good. Nicholson as the aging, but still ruthless, Irish gangster boss, is full of flavour and makes his character three dimensional. He basically acts the way you'd expect Jack Nicholson to act and that suits the character he plays just perfectly. The same goes for Matt Damon and his character. Damon seems like a very slick, charming, witty, and ambitious kind of a chap, which incidently is also traits of the character he portrais in this film (which by coincidence is also the case of Liu Dehua who plays Damons role in the original Chinese movie). The rest of the cast, as said, also delivers very good performances, which you might expect seeing that in every other shot you've got yet another star playing a minor role.  <br /> <br />Even though I'm still slightly biased towards the Chinese version (only because I saw it first, and one shouldn't compare them anyways), I still think this is a very solid film worthy of all the good things being said about it. There are of course scenes that may be a bit far fetched, but then again, it's a film, innit? The extras on this two-disc version are also very interesting. I particularly enjoyed the portrait of Scorsese. Very insightful. <br /> <br />Definitely worth watching, highly recommendable.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|As if it were possible, this DVD is even better than the original.  The music is <br />fabulous, the songs beautiful and the singers incredible.  We have watched the DVD sevreal times already.
1582701709|4.0|I have the DVD. That said, the book is redundant. Pick one or the other. Of course, if my DVD comes to harm, I will always have a backup. <br /> <br />The secret is The Law of Attraction. There are many books based on the same principles. This one is has lots of quotes and pics which appeals to me. The Da Vinci backdrop is cool, inspiring and subliminal. <br /> <br />There are many great mentors who added their thoughts to this book. Take advantage - get to know them better through their individual books, tapes, etc. They are an inspiring group. We all appreciate a hand up and positive energy. Get some.
0316172324|5.0|I read it and I enjoyed it :) <br /> <br /> <br />I think anyone who picks up this book shall enjoy it!
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Of course it's light and silly, not a heavyweight film at all. But you won't find a couple with more authentic chemistry, on all levels, than Jack and Diane. They pull off the honest, snappy dialogue perfectly. They're just a zany pair who clearly enjoy each other, probably off-screen as well. <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|I just finished watching this movie, and I really wasn't impressed at all.  I must be the only person in the world who thinks Paul Giamatti sucked in his role.  I got sick of watching him roll his eyes.  It seemed like most of the time he was still playing his part in American Splendor.<br /><br />And Rufus Sewell (I think that's how you spell it) had the worst fake mustache that I've ever seen.  As far as his character of Leo goes, they couldn't quite decide how crazy to make him.  He is supposed to be a tyrannical lunatic, but when confronted with the man who betrays him, he just walks around and doesn't do much else.  It felt like the director wanted him to be crazy, but then the character would act way too passive.<br /><br />The storyline had too many holes and too many moments that left me saying \\"wow, that was stupid/predictable\\".<br /><br />The effects were good, but nothing that we haven't seen in modern films.  For me, the only thing that kept this from getting one star was the performance by Ed Norton.  He was very good.  Unfortunately, he didn't have much to work with.  His character bounced from dark and stoic to emotional and sappy too many times.  More time should have been spent on development.<br /><br />Anyways, I think that time would be better spent with your pet than with this movie.
0765348276|5.0|Old Man's War is simply amazing for a debut novel. As an author my hat is off to John Scalzi for this work. Featuring an imaginative plot with what will soon be classic science fiction settings, this is a \\"can't put it down\\" adventure.<br /><br />The premise in itself is imaginative: the Colonial Defence Force, which defends human colonies in the stars, fulfills it's manpower requirements by signing up old men and women and \\"revamping\\" their bodies (to say more would give story points away). John Perry joins on his 75th birthday, and begins a journey which includes the revamping of his body, boot camp and battle. Along the way, different pieces of technology/culture are introduced. Some are not explained (taken for granted) but others (skip drive and beanstalk transports to name a few) are discussed as lunchtime talks between recruits, well in the flow of the story.<br /><br />Scalzi's humor is excellent, and well on display in his dialog. I actually laughed out loud at points (I usually only do that with Christopher Moore books).<br /><br />There are few big philosophical ideas here (other than classic military \\"what are we fighting for?\\" concepts), and there could be quite a bit more discussed deeper. But that is a minor issue that does not diminish the enjoyment of reading this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended. On to Ghost Brigades (the next story in the saga).
0743289684|5.0|This is the most important book I have ever read --- and I have several advanced degrees.  This should be MUST reading for all Americans.  It gives insight into the enemy that plans to take over the entire world.  It is a fresh view, less pedantic than some of the other good books on islam.  It is not about radical islam, but mainstream islam and how it is lived in its own culture.  Read it!!!
0743289684|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for Ayaan Hirsi Ali to write a better book than \\"The Caged Virgin\\" but she has done so with this book. Ali has lived a life that most people would find hard to imagine, let alone get up from constant adversity and become stronger with each time she has been knocked down and picked herself up. Born with a very bleak future as a mere female in a society where life is very cheap, she overcame the constant drumbeat of the need to submit to the commands of the Koran and its interpreters who control Somalia with fear and intimidation. She is a feminist who would make Oriana Fallaci proud by not wallowing in victimhood, but learning and advancing herself every year of her life. The word Islam linguistically means \\"submission\\" which is what she was told to do all of her life. She endured unspeakable pain with forced genital mutilation demanded by those who control Somali society, and escaped to political freedom in Holland on her way to a prearranged rape, as she calls it, to marry someone she had never met half way around the world.  <br /> <br />She learned to read Dutch, became a force for exposing Islamic excesses in Dutch society, and was elected to the Dutch Parliament where she used her office as a platform for reform. She was an irritant to all of those who pretended that Islamic immigrants were assimilating Dutch culture when Dutch culture was committing suicide by tolerating systematic rape, beatings, and even \\"honor\\" murder committed in Islamic enclaves and she was admonished for thinking that these crimes should be investigated since they were committed by the insular Islamist enclaves where Dutch liberalism was reviled as Western decadence.  <br />She left Holland for the USA in 2006 and both countries were very relieved.  <br /> <br />The amazing part of this book is not only her extraordinary command of English, but her ability to analyze what the Islamic threat really represents besides the usual suicide bomber or airplane hijacker.  <br />This is an extraordinary book, and I suspect we can look forward to many more from this young woman, assuming that the bodyguards who protect her life every day can stay one step ahead of those who have threatened her life over the years. <br />

B00005JPLU|1.0|The truth is that there are to many people in some sort of brain dead trance out there in TV land.  They watch the commercials with their eyes wide open and literally believe everything they hear coming at them.  If one were to believe everything they heard, they would think that \\"300\\" was the biggest thing since Casablanca...or at least the last super hype movies I can think of like \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" or \\"Titanic\\". <br /> <br />First off, the film is told, or rather transposed, from a graphic novel.  We basically are getting a fancy cartoon about a story that has already been told a thousand times.  I have yet to read a single review that has even gone over any of the technical aspects of this movie and stepped back and looked at it from the \\"big picture\\".  Step away, put the straw down and use some peripheral people.   <br /> <br />Hype wear off now?  Okay, so all I can say is that the storyline is great, and the dialogue is okay.  It is based off of a comic book so the whole \\"we'll blot out the sun\\" with arrows machismo got a little old.  They mix some legend and myth together and throw in the details that are widely known.  In the end you have a monstrosity of a film that, as mentioned before, is cool but nothing more than a fancy cartoon.   <br /> <br />That is what movies are now, just remakes and comic book adoptions.  Think Daredevil meets The Tick or something.  Next year at this time it will be forgotten and everyone can go back to drinking kool aid and walking like a Zombie.

1401302378|4.0|Reading some of the already posted reviews I must admit I felt a bit overwhelmed. Does everybody except me know this stuff? <br /> <br />When I read this book, and I did buy it at the same time as 'Waiting for Your Cat to Bark', I was enthralled with a concept I had never really considered before. Maybe I'm in the minority! But I found the book a really interesting read. It all made sense to me, but only after I'd read the book. I now know how the Internet is transforming the world, and how consumers now have almost unlimited choice and the power that brings to consumers and the challenges that brings to retailers. <br /> <br />The issue for me though, is what am I supposed to do this new found information?   <br /> <br />I love the interesting snippets and off beat data - I'd never considered that \\"950,000 books out of 1.2 million tracked by Nielsen BookScan sold fewer than 99 copies.........only 25,000 sold more than 5,000 copies. The average book in America sells about 500 copies.\\" Wow! There really is no money in writing - for most writers anyway. Still, Chris Anderson's book did succeed in changing my point of view. <br /> <br />I now understand the concept, I know it's not Einsteins' theory or anything, but the book is informative, it is interesting and it is challenging. For me, everything that a book should be. But what now?

B000002AGE|5.0|I have just been introduced to WR because a friend had told me about Jaco Pastorius, and when I looked him up on the net, I saw that he had played with WR.  WR has always had a reputation of having the very best musicians of the day, and so I did some research and ended up buying Heavy Weather because it was the commercial peak of WR (a gold record, 500k).   <br /> <br />Now that I've been listening to it for about a week, here are my comments: <br />There are four songs on the album that I like, the rest are boring.  Birdland is an amazing uptempo song.  A remark you made sounds really dated and slow, although it has an interesting solo section.  Teen Town is one of Jaco's compositions, and it has an amazing clockwork beat, and a dark atmospheric feel, which I did enjoy.  The next two songs were boring.  Then you get to track 6, Palladium.  This is Wayne Shorter's composition, and I must say, it is far and away my favorite song on the CD.  It's really uptempo, and Afro-Cuban.  The percussion and drums are dead on, and even dizzying.  Jaco is of course in top form here, and Z doesn't get to show much, but the whole thing is really a hallmark.  Palladium makes me feel good, a buzz, a high.  The next song was too weird for me.  The last song was a Jaco composition.  I can't remember the title, but it reminded me of something Rush might have composed except the bass line was a million times harder.  Jaco did shine, and the whole thing had some interesting chord changes.  In sum, I guess you could say I like the upbeat, jazzier WR.  For those four songs, I definitely think it was worth buying the album.  Z seems to keep his skills low key, although if you pay close attention, you will catch him doing a quick run here or there.  And I did love Jaco, who doesn't?  As an aspiring bassist, or should I say, learning bassist, I get a lot of inspiration from WR and Jaco.  But I would be lying if I didn't say that the highlight of the album, and I'm probably the only one who will ever admit this in the presence of Jaco on the album, was Acuna's efforts.  He was always crisp, ahead of the beat, and his fills could not have been better-chosen.  Acuna is a wizard, and a real pleasure to listen to. <br /> <br />So that's my take on Heavy Weather.  Highly recommended.  This is the central piece, the main hub, by which a whole genre - fusion - has been built around.
B000KQGP2G|1.0|Pain of Salvation has been one of my favourite rock bands for years. I was soooo excited to hear this album and I can't believe how dissapointed I was. Musically uncreative, boring, sounds like re-hashed songs that the band members wrote when they were 16 years old. Unstimulating, boring. Not the kind of musical innovation I've come to expect from them. <br /> <br />Nothing more to say.
B00005JPLU|5.0|it was soooooooooooooo worth getting dragged out to watch it i loved it great details, picture was great along with storyline ...and sparta's witty comments PRICELESS<br /><br />THIS is worth a space in my DVD collection..
B000BTJDG2|3.0|I had heard mixed reviews about this film but I figured it was worth giving a shot, especially on a winter night with nothing else to do.  So, here goes: <br /> <br />Overall, this movie was decent and definitely had its moments of thrills and suspense. The first half of the film is better than the second half and much of this is due to how things eventually unwind. The acting was solid, the pace was just about right, and there wasnt any uneccessary gore or \\"cheese\\" which did help.  The thing that holds this back is character development and the flashback-style of story-telling which I dont really like that much. <br /> <br />Emily Rose seemed like a very good person and a great daughter/girlfriend.  At least I think. I say I \\"think\\" because they dont really develop her at all and we only get glimpses of what this girl was like. She simply doesnt get much screen-time prior to her posession and this, IMO, hurts our feelings towards her. Obviously they couldn't spend  an hour on this but I needed to know her better before I could really care about what was happening to her. Also, the Priest could have been a little more dramatic at times. He appeared to just read his lines sometimes and wasnt really getting into it as much as I felt he should be. Laura Linneys character had a little backstory but nothing out of the ordinary: Hot shot young lawyer, aggressive, agnostic, etc, etc. <br /> <br />Emilys family was also not given enough screen time and they also had a hard time portraying how unsettling this whole ordeal must have been. I needed to see more emotion out of these people, especially in the courtroom..... which brings me to my next issue: Too much courtroom footage and much of it was a little underwhelming.  The flashback style seemed to build a little momentum and then it was back to the dreary, dull courtroom. The timing was off on this several times and I wanted to see more of this exorcism and the details surrounding it.  I would have liked to see this first hand  as opposed to having the lawyers summarize it for me. I would have been able to make my own decisions then as to what really might have happened here. Plus, this movie was suposed to be more of a thriller/horror film and it leaned towards being a courtroom drama with flashbacks to what appeared to be a VERY cool exorcism. Lastly, there were a few \\"noises in the night\\" moments that didnt really go anywhere for some of the characters and the defenses \\"special\\" witness has a problem that didnt add to the story at all, IMO. <br /> <br />So.... sounds bad so far after all that doesnt it?  Well, it wasnt and I still enjoyed it. The exorcism was pretty well done with some truly disturbing images and scenes. This girl was downright terrified and you could see that. She was seeing things that certainly would have made me nervous and the scene in the barn was pretty dramatic and a little freaky. The questions raised about religion vs medicine are pretty standard fare but it was still interesting to watch. By the end, I was rooting for the Priest on trial, at least mostly. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie is worth a watch but I dont think has enough redeeming value to warrant a purchase. Netflix it or Rent it, but thats all I can recommend.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|many heartfelt prayers and condolences and appreciation go out to the family of the late, great bradley delp, in deep honour of his untimely and unexpected passing on march 9, 2007.  brad had one of the most recognizable lead voices in rock and roll, and i think that there are more than enough classic rock fans out there that feel the same way i do.  and sure enough, this is only going to spike a few more sales of this classic album, and get even more airplay on classic/70's rock stations all over the world.  boston fans out there, start gettin' the word out on this classic masterwork, and get people to knowing to everlasting vocals of brad delp.  rest in peace, brother, the lead vocalists of heaven have already welcomed you.
1582701709|5.0|What a great, quick, easy read to help us begin to understand our own impact on our own lives.  A good way to stop blaming everything, everyone else and start looking at ourselves.  This is a cute, chunky little book which now resides on my nightstand -- quick & easy to reference.  Thank you to Rhonda Byrne and her collaborators for reminding us about the Law of Attraction.

Wow this woman is laughing all the way to the bank.  I cannot believe people are still so gullible, but apparently there millions of them.  In fact I saw a show about people actually giving away their life savings to gain millions from Nigeria!!!  If you buy this book you really are wasting your money and putting more into an elitist snobs pocket, but just stay positive and she can continue to roll in the dollars, while we all continue to suffer through our daily grinds...
0060734191|5.0|This is one of my favorite story series.  I love the strong female characters.  I am really thrilled to see a very strong and clear writing style.  There is depth to the characters, clarity in the relationships, and a forward moving plotline.  The best part is that Nix wraps it all up with a satisfying conclusion, leaving us with an appetite for more, rather than being overdone on it! <br />This was a really well imagined and developed realm that almost seems real. <br />Excellent choice of book.

B000002KL3|2.0|By far. Can't beleive all of the glowing reviews for this one. Well, i guess thats what this page can do sometimes. Just a lousey, confused effort in my book. Love VH too, favorite band of all time, but just could never warm up to WACF. \\"CRADLE\\" and \\"EVERYBOY WANTS...\\" are decent VH staples and fine in their own right, but the REST! Much of the material on this album sounds like B-side and outtakes! \\"LOSS OF CONTROL\\" \\"COULD THIS BE MAGIC\\" AND \\"TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME\\" are just failed experiments. WACF is just a weak, limp-wristed transistional album for the band. It still gets two stars because this is atleast better then III and much of the dreck put out under VAN HAGAR.<br /><br />Here is the 3 best VH albums;<br /><br />(1) \\"Fair Warning\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"VH 1\\"<br /><br />(3) \\"Diver Down\\" (the most underrated VH album)<br /><br />Here are the 3 worst;<br /><br />(1) \\"OU812\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"Women and Children First\\"<br /><br />(3) \\"VH III (everyone loves to bash this monstosity)\\"

B000KCHZK6|3.0|I love Norah Jones and think she is an amazing talent. The 1st CD, Come Away with Me, is a tough act to follow, even for the artist herself. Not Too Late is just a ho-hum (slightly boring) representation of the style and selection she usually does. I would love to hear a fresh and new compilation of music such as the impact and WOW factor of her 1st CD. I would not have purchased this product had I listenend to it first.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The first thing anyone will notice about this film is Christian Bale's emaciated frame. He lost over 60 pounds to perform this role and the scenes of him shirtless are rather grotesque, yet effective to his character. His acting I must say is superb, he truly delivers a wide range of emotions - fury, bewilderment, passive satisfaction, the whole nine yards.  <br /> <br />The directing is also excellent, the entire movie is shot in soft colors and lighting, which gives it a mellow, yet ominous feel. The symbolism is heavy, featuring repeated symbols in different forms. The movie has an atmosphere of urgent tranquility which drags the viewer into the paranoid state of Trevor Reznik, the main character. <br /> <br />My only qualm about this flick, is that it reminds me of much of the last decade's hip indie thriller plotlines. I don't want to give too much away, but you kind of have to push movies like Fight Club, American Psycho, Memento, Pi, Following, etc, out of your mind in order to truly enjoy it without an annoying sense of de ja vu. Certain points of the movie become like a mishmash of these aforementioned films... It also maintains a Hitchcockian vibe throughout with its desperate, schizoid portrayal of the protagonist.  <br /> <br />Sparing this it is a stylish, engrossing film which hits the mark. I recommend before watching this film to pretend you had never seen the films I previously mentioned, and it will be much more enjoyable. Otherwise the movie could become like a cycling of cliche questions concerning a disturbed mind... <br />
0131479415|4.0|This is an excellent book for project managers who are interested in using agile methods.  I'm a developer that has been on several agile projects and this book was very interesting to me, but I think it really hits the project management sweet spot.  Some things that I gleaned from this book that I hadn't found in other books: epic stories, themes, burndown bar charts.  The author has a very readable writing style.  Agile practitioners should definitely read this book.  It does possess some new information that other books (the XP series of books) do not cover.  Highly recommended!

B000002UBU|5.0|I was so strongly in agreement with an earlier review of The Don McLean \\"American Pie\\" Album which I have loved for almost as many years as its initial release.  The song \\"Empty Chairs is a forever favorite and also brings a tear as often as I allow myself to experience the strong emotion of its heartfelt performance.  I missed the cover by Garth Brooks and I'm very sure it must have been first rate.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Now my kids are experiencing the same fun I had when I was their age with this movie and and the music.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|In STEP UP, cultures clash and the musical worlds of ballet and hip hop amicably collide. When troubled, young carjacker Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and his homies break into and trash the Maryland School of the Arts, Tyler is nabbed and is penalized with 200 hours of community service at that same institute. There, toiling away as a custodian, he catches a glimpse of ballet dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) as she beguilingly works thru a floor routine. Tyler is accordingly intrigued with her grace and beauty. A little later, Nora looks out a window and witnesses Tyler outside goofing around with some nifty hip hop moves. Hmmm....curiousity is piqued.<br /><br />The school's senior showcase presents an all-important plot device as it is key in Nora garnering a lucrative post-graduate livelihood as potential dance company employers will be present for her performance. Too, she's promised her unsupportive mom that if her showcase proves unsuccessful (ie, she doesn't land a gig) she'll settle for a more practical vocation. Calamity strikes when Nora's dance partner suffers an injury and bows out of the showcase and Nora's ensuing search for a new partner proves frustratingly futile (apparently, a lot of these male dancers are puny wusses who can't hoist up a girl without embarassingly collapsing in a wimpy heap). Tyler, fueled by his attraction for the girl, steps up and is able to successfully pass Nora's lift try-out. Nora gives him a shot, despite misgivings from her and the skeptical school director. However, their doubts soon bear fruition as Tyler initially doesn't take Nora's classical dancing seriously, is tardy for practice, and even quits for a time. But, finally, something clicks in Tyler's brain as he at last finds his rudder and zeroes in on what he wants - the chance to pursue his new-found dream and, of course, the girl...<br /><br />STEP UP is energized by the two vibrant leads, Tatum and Dewan. Gee, it's nice to be young and hot and in tune with your body. Jenna Dewan is beautiful and shows off her acting chops, while Channing Tatum's acting is choppy but, at least, he is, to quote the girls, \\"babe-a-licious\\" - he's certainly got that laid back, smoldering thing going on (I'm trying not to hate). Plus and importantly, these two can dance it up, with Tatum a particular stand-out as the white-boy dancer from the slums who can bust a move. Tatum and Dewan breaking it down and funking it up in the club and, later, on stage are showstoppers. The movie also benefits from the secondary pair of dj Mario (Miles Darby) and his crush, the seemingly unattainable Lucy (Drew Avila), both of whom provide amiable support for our stars. Damaine Radcliffe also turns in a solid performance as Mac, Tyler's lifelong best friend, who feels his friendship with Tyler slipping away as Tyler becomes more embroiled in the doings at the Maryland school. Mac's younger brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington), however, is plain annoying in his lame attempts to win his bro's well regard. Plus, you see his story arc coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Somewhat reminiscent of FAME but not quite in the same vein as the more urban YOU GOT SERVED, STEP UP is great fun and, at times, exhilarating to watch. There's nothing new here, of course, but everything in this coming-of-age story is done in such a good natured way that I just sat back and let myself pleasantly sink into the movie, and to blazes with the cliches. True, the romance is done by the numbers, but the thumpin', hip-swayin' soundtrack and the dynamic dance sequences go a long way to make the film palatable. Ultimately, I walked away from this film feeling pretty good. Still empty headed, and half-heartedly determined to learn the Crip Walk, yeah, but feeling good. And, now, I guess I'm ready to tackle STOMP THE YARD.dy.

B000KCHZK6|1.0|I was very disappointed with this CD. Sounded like recycled tracks of her first two CDs, and there was not a single song that caught my attention. I listened very carefully, more than once, because I love her voice and her first two efforts.  <br />Don't waste your money.
B00005JPLW|2.0|Like so many others, I saw the high definition trailer for this movie and was hooked. WOW! Incredible style and visuals! Great music! Must go see the movie! And so I did. And at the end, it was like....yawn.....ok .....so that was it?<br /><br />For despite its enormously powerful graphic design and action-packed scenes, the movie ultimately fails in a number of areas.<br /><br />The first and foremost is as entertainment. In between the enthralling CGI-heavy battle scenes with all the blood spraying everywhere and the heads and limbs getting lopped off, the pacing is surprisingly slow. The movie FEELS slow, largely because of awkward plot elements and really clumsy dialogue. The best parts of the movie are basically already in that high definition trailer.<br /><br />Several subplots and scenes just didn't feel right. All that stuff that happened between Queen Gorgo and Theron just didn't make sense - was she a proud Queen trying to save her city-state, a devoted wife trying to save her husband, a cheap whore, an angry woman unable to control her temper, what was all that supposed to be about? And those scenes where Leonidas's Captain goes berserk with grief when his son is killed - isn't this guy supposed to be a SPARTAN? A manly man's man of a soldier, practically exalting in the chance to die in battle, all of a sudden breaking down like that?<br /><br />The dialogue....\\"Freedom isn't free!\\" says Queen Gorgo....ahem... (more on this freedom stuff later). The worst had to be the long speech at the end of the movie to the Spartan troops by Delios (played by David Wenham, a.k.a. Captain Faramir from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" - in disguise wearing only a red cape and bikini pants - but still recognizable with that nose and slight Aussie accent). So much like its counterpart in Shakespeare's \\"Henry V\\" that I half expected Delios/Captain Faramir to finish his speech with a stirring reference to St. Crispin's Day.<br /><br />And all those deformed mutants....OK, so we know that Frank Miller has this thing for them, especially together with beautiful semi-naked women.....but still, isn't there some sort of a Society for the Prevention of Making Fun of Deformed People to protest this sort of stuff? After a while it just got too grotesque, and detracted from some of the really beautiful, poetic artwork of this movie. I don't know about you, but that scene with the Oracle and the horribly deformed Ephor was just gross...(the real Ephors, by the way, were the elected representatives in the government of Sparta and had nothing to do with the Oracle of Delphi and were certainly not leperous mutants).<br /><br />It has been a long Hollywood tradition to pick upon the commonly perceived enemies of America and utilize them as villains for its movies, and then portray them in grotesque stereotype. In other eras, these villains have included the evil Nazis, the evil Japanese, and the evil communist Russians and Chinese. And so, not surprisingly in this movie, with the overtones of our current political climate, the Persians are the evil villains, and are portrayed as heavily body-pierced, bejeweled non-Caucasian caricatures. In contrast, the heroic Spartan soldiers, are of course all portrayed by handsome white men of northern/western European descent.<br /><br />You might begin to guess by now that there is much in this movie that defies the real history of what happened at Thermopylae and in ancient Greece. While many critics have leveled this charge already, rather than nitpicking again at the obvious, I would focus on the one criticism that has not been emphasized, and that is that the worst falsehood of all of this movie is its depiction of the Spartans as heroic defenders of freedom.<br /><br />The reality is that the Spartans were an elite minority in their own city-state. They had migrated there and conquered and enslaved the original inhabitants of the area, who became the helots, the very large slave class of Spartan society. Like everywar-making tribe of the time, they fought mainly to enslave and gain power over other people. They would band together with the other Greek city-states just long enough to fight off the Persian threat before getting back to the business of fighting the other Greeks again for local superiority. And so the triumph over the Persians would be followed by the Peloponnesian War, the Corinthian War, etc., etc. Ironically, at the end of the Corinthian War, the Spartans would sell out the cities of Cyprus and Iona to the Persian Empire in order to gain an advantage over the other Greek city-states in the peace treaty.<br /><br />So with all this talk of \\"freedom\\" in this movie, the truth is that freedom was for the Spartans only. They did not share their freedom with anyone else. It would be as if a movie were made depicting Confederate soldiers fighting in the American Civil War as defenders of freedom. Brave and loyal to each other and their cause, yes, defenders of their slave-owning ways of life yes, but defenders of freedom, absolutely not.<br /><br />One final bummer - that terrific bit of music used in the trailer for this movie does NOT appear in the movie, nor is it on the movie soundtrack CD. It turns out to be \\"Just Like You Imagined\\", by Nine Inch Nails, from the album \\"The Fragile\\".artan society.

B000L22WTO|2.0|3 tracks on this CD, Rick Wright sounds terrible, David Bowie a little better and Dave Gilmour is ok, just. If you are a Gilmour fan like I am, you need it for your collection to be complete but don't expect quality music.
0060776757|5.0|OK, I'm a big U2 fan and that would make my view biased, but this book is GREAT! <br />I received it as a gift from my girlfiend and I've loved it. It has all that detail in one source, direct from U2. You can feel the band's character in each page, you know which member is writin each part even from just flicking through the pages. <br />I consider it's a must have for any fan, a way of getting really close to the band, \\"even better than the real thing\\". <br />If you're looking for a gift ida for a U2 fan there is nothing better (unless they already have it =)  <br />
1582701709|5.0|I ordered the book form as a tool to the The Secret on DVD. The book offers more information, tools and examples useful in learning, studying the Law of Attraction which I have known about for years, but at that given time I was not able to locate(years ago)the information necessary for me to fully understand it and how to apply it.  The book is excellent and very useful. It is very well written, and I read it often for continued inspiration and helping to stay focused on my desires for myself in the present. And, with the additional tools and information in the book, in conjuction with the DVD \\"out of nowhere and out of noway\\" my desires are slowing manifesting themselves with as \\"coinidences\\" showing up to affirm I on track, my desires are waiting , guidance for the footwork, faith in the process as it continues in my life, etc. I believed in the The Secret as viewed on the DVD which is very inspirational, believed it for me based on my existing study and belief of Univeral Laws and Bachelors Degree field of science; however, the book gave me further understanding, information, more tools to get going and useful to reread and reread along with the DVD daily. I strongly recommended the book. Written with clarity, inspiration ,and the book is written not long in length which can be easily read in one setting. <br />Rhonda Byrne has done an excellent job of carrying the message of what she has been freely, and the gifts she has received as a result of The Secret. And, offered more in the book of her journey. Rhonda Byrne is someone as in the book and DVD, I trust her truth, journey as written because her sincerity and passion to carry the message to others which she herself experienced based on The Secret. There is nothing about the book I do not believe based on my personal years of experience, in addition, there is nothing to warrant but the truth in the book as written by Rhonda Byrne. It is not misleading, but based on those of the past and present people who understood the The Secret which I recognized already on my spiritual journey years ago and present. Hats off to a well written book, a spiritual way of living by Rhonda Byrne. She has my upmost respect for her dedication in this book, and hopefully more in the future. Thank you for your gift Rhonda Byrne and sharing.
B00005M91K|5.0|Its amazing how strongly images and music can impact the senses without any spoken word.    This is a great film to throw on, relax, and absorb.
B00005JPLU|5.0|I rarely write movie reviews but this is one I had to throw down.  Do not be alarmed by critics, just decide for yourself if you would like to see it or not.  I do not expect people to watch it because I said it was great, but I hope they don't turn away because people seem upset with it.  Everything about it is just so powerful; it is simply a different way to tell a story.  Colorful though dark, everything about it stands out to me even though I have left the theater.  The story is told from the Frank Miller graphic novel and with this approach (Hulk movie tried this with just a sliver) is able to really bring a lot of epic scenes to life.  Regardless of what is happening throughout the film, it is splendid and fun.  The story surrounding the Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army up against an assault of Persians is quite a story in itself.  Overall a fantastic theater experience and I do not regret attending this film.
B000002J0P|5.0|Listen to this CD and you're right back in your Volkswagen headed for Woodstock.  The lyrics are not only amazing, they are meaningful, and, I can't even believe I remember every single word considering the times and possibly ingested hallucinogenics.  Take me back anytime.  It was so free-spirited and meaningful, as is this music.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|That's how much faith I have in Ms. Winehouse!! I got a free download from iTunes a few months back called \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" and I haven't been able to tear myself away from her hypnotic and nostalgic voice!! <br /> <br />I already know that this album will be great. She has such a No Holds Barred way of living that it has no choice BUT to spew over into her music. I can't wait to buy this album!
B000FFJYB6|5.0|Family and kids love this movie.  Forget the blood, guts and violence...it's good without it.
B000065BPB|5.0|These HD-280 headphones sound as good if not better than the HD-555 which cost a lot more,  I really like the coiled cable which is much more convenient.  The closed cup keeps out unwanted surrounding noise.  They are a great deal for the 79.99 I paid.  The only drawback is they fit kind of tight, but that's my fat head I guess,
B000B8QG4A|5.0|My girlfriend and I watched this for our late Valentine's Day celebration, and I think it was really nice to be able to enjoy a simple story with a lot of meaning.  So much of it rings true, and the quaintness of the imagery and storytelling is a fresh change.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|This is the quintessential police drama, especially in San Fransisco.  Robert Vaughn is the perfect example of political interference with the otherwise (hopefully) unincumbered investigative process designed to solve crimes. Steve Mc Queen is the ultimate example of the dedicated policeman, despite private inhibiting influences, who does what he has to to find the guilty, and bring them to justice. The car chase upped the ante on car chases forever after. I do have to provide some background positive influence info. My wife, Laurie, and I happened to visit San Francisco Interanational Airport the very night Steve and the film crew filmed the Airport sequences. Best night of our lives!
B000MGUZMU|4.0|This CD, as expected, is getting tons of reviews- they are very varied. All I can say is that I was pretty disappointed the first 10 times through. Not even by comparion to Funeral because that is just an unrealistic expectation, but just for the music on it's own it seemed like a step backward. But now that I have really absorbed it I realize how upbeat and driving it is.  <br /> <br />It just takes some time- there are a few songs they could easily lose- especially Black Waves, anytime I hear her sing I want to stab myself in the ears- her voice is off key , forced, and grating to me- but otherwise give this some time- it will hit you- and live I think all of these songs will be taken to new levels.
B00009Z574|3.0|I was 14 when this came out - and I had just become a huge Yes fan. I remember me and my friends - who were passionate about Yes - were shocked by this album: the quality of the compositions, the recording, and the level of creativity seemed to have slipped considerably since \\"Going for the One,\\" which came out just the year before. When we learned that some of the tracks on this album were recycled \\"leftovers\\" from previous albums, it only further lowered our opinion of it. Tracks such as \\"Circus of Heaven\\" and \\"Madrigal\\" seemed like a radical shift in direction, compared to tracks like \\"Awaken\\" and \\"Gates of Delirium.\\" Another reviewer here used the word \\"sissy\\" in his headline - I think, compared to their earlier material, that word could be used to decribe tracks such as \\"Circus of Heaven.\\" Suddenly, the band had lost its serious tone with the introduction of much more light-hearted material.    Also damaging our appreciation of this album were the screechy keyboard sounds provided by Rick Wakeman: Why anyone back then thought the birotron sounded good is still beyond me - it must be one of the worst sounding electronic instruments ever made!  At times, I wonder if the introduction of this \\"raw\\" keyboard sound was part of some effort to make the band more appealing amidst the rapidly emerging punk and new wave scene. (to me, the birotron has kind of a \\"new wave\\" sound to it ....)    Still, this album has retained its nostaligic quality for me. Songs such as \\"Silent Wings of Freedom,\\" \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" and \\"Future Times\\" certainly make it worth buying if you are a Yes fan. These songs also made great live selections for the band's 1978 tour.    Interestingly, a couple of years later, the band went through a major line up change, and put out \\"Drama,\\" which to me represented a return to form (with a more serious tone). As a fan, I could only come to surmise that Anderson - who did not appear on Drama - was the reason for the lighter fare which cropped up on \\"Tormato.\\"  I sort of didn't miss his presence on Drama, because it is a great album with awesome Howe/Squire work. But I ultimately came to realize that Anderson was, and still is, a critical ingredient in the Yes formula.    So, if you are a big Yes fan, but you don't own Tormato yet, be prepared for material that represents a shift away from the deep, spacy, intellectual music that the band put out between \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Going for the One.\\" There is plenty here to enjoy, as long as you are prepared for the change in style.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I first saw this movie at its first appearance at the Red Vic in San Francisco. I found it trippy : the most innovative visuals I had seen in a movie for a long time, used for supporting an intellectual, however dreamy and poetic story. Wow, that was good. <br />The Red Vic as other independent movie theaters just play a movie a couple of nights in a row. The next day I thought I could bring some friends to see it and have a good evening after together. The line was so huge the theater was filled before we could reach the door, as the next day... <br /> <br />Yes, it is a good movie, if you like the poetry of being alive and sharing it, and you enjoy the good, the ugly, and the game of wondering about it.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The only thing I believe should have happened is that DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson should have all been nominated for Best Actor!!  This was an excellent story well told by Scorsese.  The acting was phenominal!  A powerful movie.  Critical comments from friends of mine who watched it; Fight scenes looked fake (punches missing) and \\"not as good as Raging Bull or Goodfellas\\".  I disagree this is right up there as one of the top 10 movies of the past 20 years!!  Enjoy.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|The first third was poor, then things began to pick up a little, and the acting of DeCaprio, Damon and Nicholson was very good - yes Nicholson actually was able to step out of his own \\"Jackness\\" and enmesh himself in the roll - but the tacked on, silly ending should have been changed. <br /> <br />****Spoiler Alert**** <br /> <br />I didn't read the book (if there was one), but the way the DeCaprio character was killed off was stupid, and the film should have just ended with him arresting Matt Damon.  It's not that I needed to have a \\"happy ending\\" to the film, its that the other crooked cop on Costello's payroll seemed like a throw-in to the film to add an emotional jolt to moviegoers who had not engaged the first 2 1/2 hours of the movie. <br /> <br />****Spoiler End**** <br /> <br />I have been watching Martin's fllm's for over 3 decades, and Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Casino, etc. tower over this one.  But then again, the MPAA did nominate Babel for best picture, so maybe tastes are dumbing down these days...
B000M4RG42|3.0|It's good movie, based on a true story.  Flashbacks within flashbacks is an interesting technique used by Eastwood.  The acting is good, not really powerful.
B00009V7OL|5.0|The Abyss Special Edition gives you both the Original Theatrical Version, and the Special Director's Cut with almost 30 minutes of footage integrated into the film that was never in theaters. It's unfortunate that those who saw the film in theaters and didn't buy James Cameron's directors cut will miss out on what this movie was REALLY meant to be.<br /><br />The new footage gives the movie an ENTIRELY different ending, only because while the original's simply gave us an ending concluding a story about alien lifeforms discovered below sea, the director's cut gives us that, PLUS an entire deeper meaning/lesson of human life. So even if you buy this version, the ONLY version to view is the Director's cut. Plus disc 2 gives you amazing special features. It's definitely a package worth buying if you're into epic and meaningful movies. An amazing soundtrack and stellar character performances make this one of the best sleeper hits of the 20th century.<br /><br />-Widescreen<br /><br />-English and Spanish subtitles<br /><br />-English Audio only<br /><br />-171 minutes (director's cut)
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I have been very much looking forward to the release of \\"A New Journey\\", the latest compilation with Celtic Woman. David Downes did a great job writing the arragements for all the ladies, and conducting the orchestra.<br /><br />The new addition, Hayley, brought with her a fresh new voice that fits beautifully with the others.<br /><br />I loved the way the stage was designed. It gave Mairead the perfect way to dance, jump and run all over the place with her fiddle.<br /><br />The ladies brought back some of the songs from the previous album, and I am sure these are audience favorites, and added some new ones that make the whole concert a fun experience.<br /><br />With the beautiful backdrop of a real castle, Slane Castle, beautifully designed costumes for the soloists and chorus, and the heavenly voices of six fabulous ladies, all I can say is<br /><br />THank you for your beautiful performance. I can't wait to see you in concert live!
074356619X|5.0|I have been a student of positive thinking and metaphysical for over thirty years so this was nothing new.  But it is a great pep talk.  It is sometimes difficult to stay positive in the world we live.  And it is even more difficult to find like minded people.  So this CD made me smile.  I bought two.  One to share and another to keep in my library when I need a boost.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I purchased the DVD and CD combo with the Irish charm. Could not wait to watch the video and listen to the songs. I was not disappointed! And the charm is beautiful.<br /><br />These ladies should be called Celtic Goddesses or Celtic Angels....<br /><br />I look forward to more from the ladies. In the meantime, I think I will start checking out their solo albums.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife, who loves all things Irish.  The music is pretty, the ladies lovely, and a tranquil mood is set by the whole production. <br /> <br />This works best for me as something to have on at the end of the day.  One doesn't have to watch it intently; it serves as a good audio/visual wallpaper while one winds down. <br /> <br />Although, I must admit, I do find myself looking up when Mairead runs about playing her fiddle.  At these moments I have to remind myself that this DVD was a gift for my wife, not eye-candy for me.
B000000XB9|5.0|I found the used Hybrid SA-CD at a used record store, and bought it for my dad as he's a big CCR fan. Little did I know it would soon be in regular rotation in my CD player. The quality of the mastering in suburb, and even without taking advantage of the glorious clarity of SACD, it will sound good on any system. Don't pass this CD up.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is truly the ulitmate movie adventure. It has everything, hatred, love, suspense, risking your life for another, fear etc. This movie portrays humanity at its best and at its worst. Truly amazing, fear and thought provoking, and a tear-jerker. AND to cap all this off, it's actually based on real events, not just a great story made up by someone. At the end of the movie when Schindler realized the amount of good he'd done, but at the same time felt that he could and should have done more, I cried for about 10 minutes. This was the most powerfully moving movie I've ever seen, and I doubt anyone will ever make another one to surpass this one. Definitely buy this!
0393324818|5.0|I literally could not put it down. I spent all afternoon reading this book with a laptop in front of me--occasionally checking current stats on players and teams mentioned throughout the book. It's 2007, and it's interesting time to read this book--as we are beginning to see the results of the 2002 draft.  <br /> <br />I'm a baseball fan who has basically learned about baseball through watching games, listening to broadcasters, and reading box scores. I've often thought there were intangibles behind baseball numbers and commentaries that I didn't understand, that I would often defer to \\"experts\\" to explain. This book opened my eyes to a whole new way of understanding baseball.  <br /> <br />Baseball is a game best remembered by fan's casual observations: defining moments, oddities, streaks, records, superstitions, etc. To say this all doesn't matter seems more than anything, rude. But I understand that I have to separate our subjective memories from an objective measurement of a game from a standpoint of the front office. After all, baseball is business, with billions of dollars involved. This book talks about how one front office is treating baseball like it's all business. It's different, it's refershing, and I can't believe I've watched baseball without this knowledge so far.  <br /> <br />It's difficult for me to filter out a judgement of this book based solely from a literary standpoint, because the subject itself was so interesting for me. But weaving between biographical narrative and real time events and actions, it was cohesive, and it held my attention. It told a story about numbers, using excerpt, events, quotes, and colorful characters.  <br /> <br />This book is about narrative, not actual analysis. I'm not 100% sold on the ideas behind this book, as I've yet to see the numbers and the regressions for myself. But it's given me new ways to learn from a different perspective. It's definitely gotten me looking more forward to this coming season of major league baseball.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I wasn't disappointed and years later still listen all the time.

B00003CXIY|4.0|If you like the typical teenage comedy, then you should give this movie a try. It does fall for some of the routine story lines that are in every movie like this, but it is still a funny movie. The best part is probably when they visit Tom Green's grandparents. I never can get over the dog that talks, lol. Overall, like I said, if you like teen comedies then you will like this movie. Avoid it if you don't
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I didn't know that Russell Crowe could do comedy so well! <br />I loved it and recommend it! I am sure that I see some characters taken from Mayle's \\"A Year In Provence\\" <br />I am so happy that I didn't read any reviews prior to viewing. <br /> <br />The book was excellent and the movie was delightful! <br />
1400049628|5.0|This book takes itself really seriously.  It documents supposed real life zombie events, as well as goes into vivid detail as to how to defend yourself and prepare for a zombie attack.  The book is without a doubt interesting.  I really enjoyed the worst case scenerios and thought the book was a really fun read.  Definitely pick the book up if you're into the zombie genre or just want something that's fun.
B0000019PA|5.0|my friend happened upon this band by accident, then passed it on to me, and then I passed it on to other friends. almost like herpes, either way this is some great music here, its a shame that they never got big enough to do more with their music because it is loads better then the common trite that is on our shelves these day..  <br />  this album above all others is great, from begening to end. check it out!
B00020HEL6|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  Fresh, fun, relaxing, and not the same old stuff you hear all the time.
0060925000|5.0|amazing book. I really enjoyed Golden Gate, and here I'm reading 'A Suitable Boy' 20 years later. Same deep narrative, same incredibly good dialogue, same themes.    The weird part is that this book could be academically taken on. No matter what happens I will tell my friends about it, & it will be sold.    Ron Skurat  [...]  415-218-4781
B00079FUI6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Desperate Housewives and I would recommend this DVD set to any fan.
B00000DC7L|5.0|This is must-have stuff for any Queen fan.  Brian rocks his heart out, holds nothing back.  His cover of Hendrix's \\"One Rainy Wish\\" is just phenomenal.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|There is about as much truth in this 'documentary' as in Cohen's \\"Borat\\".  Follow the money trail.  Gore's 'carbon credits' are designed to separate you from your money.
B000M341QO|5.0|GREAT movie!  funny, action, romance and thriller all at once.  Not for young folks or those who are offended easily.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The blurb for \\"The Departed\\" states that this is director Martin Scorsese's best effort since \\"Goodfellas\\".  Excuse, Me!  Since Goodfellas Scorsese's output includes \\"Cape Fear\\" (1991), \\"The Age of Innocence\\" (1993), \\"Casino\\"(1995), \\"Kundun\\" (1997), \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\" (1999), \\"Gangs of New York\\" (2002), and \\"The Aviator\\"(1994).  Not a stinker in the bunch.  In my personal opinion Scorsese probably deserved the Best Picture Oscar on at least six occasions:  \\"Mean Streets\\" (1973);\\"The Sting\\" won, \\"Taxi Driver (1976);\\"Rocky\\" won, \\"Raging Bull\\" (1980);\\"Ordinary People\\" won,  \\"The King of Comedy\\" (1983);\\"Terms of Endearment won, \\"Goodfellas\\"(1990);\\"Dances with Wolves\\" won, and \\"The Aviator\\" (1994);\\"Million Dollar Baby\\" won.  Five actors have taken home gold from Scorsese films:  Ellen Burstyn, \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\"(1974), Robert DeNiro, \\"Raging Bull\\" (1980), Paul Newman, \\"The Color of Money\\" (1986), Joe Pesci, \\"Goodfellas\\"(1990), and Cate Blanchett, \\"The Aviator\\" (1994).  Put this in perspective, Steven Spielberg who some consider America's finest director never delivered an Oscar for any of his actors.  The highest compliment that can be paid to Scorsese is that Daniel Day-Lewis came out of his self-imposed sabbatical to appear in \\"Gangs of New York\\".  So now Scorsese has joined the Avildsens and Costners with a best director Oscar.  When Marty won it was kind of a bittersweet moment.  For sure it was a long time coming.  \\"The Departed\\" was most certainly the best film of the nominated five, though I have a soft spot for \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\".  In my mind, though, the best picture of 2006 was \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\".  \\"The Departed\\" to me didn't hold up to Scorsese's stringent standards.  One quibble I had was Scorsese's use of rock music that in previous films acted as a Greek Chorus to the action on screen.  Here this same device added nothing to the film.  Maybe Sorsese should have enlisted Robby Robertson for his input.  Also, the film's content didn't seem to justify it's running time.  Those reservations aside the film's main strengths were William Monahan's adaptation of \\"Infernal Affairs\\" and the superb ensemble cast.  Monahan took the basic plot from the Hong Kong thriller and fleshed out the characters and added new and intriguing twists to the story.  Much has been made of the actors on hand but I'd like to cite Matt Damon for particular praise.  His sleazy cop is a work of great subtlety and nuance.  Check Damon out in Robert DeNiro's \\"The Good Shepherd\\" where his understated work brings to mind Gene Hackman in \\"The Conversation\\".  I guess I'll just conclude by saying justice was finally served but it was too long coming.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It was sad that TV cut this series off before it was over because this was one of the best shows during that time.
1582701709|1.0|This is random collection of thoughts and ideas by a variety of people.  It was very hard to follow.  I think the the DVD might have been easier to understand.  I'm not good with names so when John Doe(1st specialist) spoke, I couldn't relate it to when he spoke before. <br /> <br />I also wouldn't recommend this as bible based as I originally thought.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is the latest movie we have added to our family's collection of movies by Miyazaki and as usual we were not disappointed one bit. My daughter was so taken with it she is planning on being Nausicaa for Halloween (she was Miyazaki's Princess Mononke last year). As is typical you are pulled into the story at once and you never want to get out. We have viewed it at least a half a dozen times or more since we got it and we are not tired of it one bit. You can see in these characters the germs that will be the the two main characters in Castle in the Sky, which was his next project. If you liked Spirited Away or any others by Miyazaki you will find this one just as satisfying. If you have never seen a Miyazaki movie and are wanting to see one this is fantastic, though Spirited Away or Castle in the Sky (if you have a little girl, start with Kiki's Delivery Service) might be slightly better for a first one. But do definitely see them all, they ROCK!
B00006CXSS|5.0|An extremely enjoyable experience. For those who loved Saving Private Ryan, you will savour the same experience here. Well made, well acted and directed. All the better for being based on actual events.

B000LE1FAY|4.0|Belinda Carlisle has returned to the music industry and to my ears...it's a welcomed return. Even though the cd is entirely sung in French, it's one of her best (and I don't even speak the language). The cd I bought also came with an extra cd of four of the songs sung in English and I actually prefer the french versions. Her vibrato wraps around these songs like they were made for each other. A MUST have for any Carlisle fan.
1582701709|5.0|I have watched this DVD about 25 times and each time I learn a little more.  I feel that if I apply the suggestions this movie will change my life for the better
B000E6UK5K|5.0|by far the best solo effort from mr gilmour, this sounds like the best pink floyd album since \\"dark side of the moon.\\" his vocals are cool and tranquil on these fantastic songs of mortality and aging, but it is the incredibly lyrical guitar work that really makes this a stunning recording. silence lingers around the edges of the music as the rich beautiful tone of his guitar weeps and cries and phrases deep emotions. a gorgeous masterpiece. mojo magazine picked this as the 18th best album of 2006, it is among my favorite five of the year. mr gilmour hadn't recorded in over ten years prior to this release. i hope the next album comes quicker.
0307341542|5.0|Really superb.  If you read any of my reviews you can see I dont spare the vitriol.  But really I have none to give here. One of the best books I have read this year.
1582701709|1.0|Six months from now, Oprah will be disowning this book and apologizing to her audience (a la A Million Little Pieces) amid reports that teenagers are using this book to further ostracize their overweight peers (\\"if I don't hang out with you, your FAT THINKING won't rub off on me!\\") as well as justify their incredibly bloated sense of self-worth and entitlement (\\"all I have to do is imagine it and think positively enough and IT WILL BE MINE! Like that awesome BMW I got for my Sweet Sixteen!\\"). Further, Oprah will talk extensively about her change of heart when she began to hear right-wing conservatives use the Secret to justify huge cutbacks in programs to aid the poor and lower class (\\"the thinking of America's poor is so negative, they just don't get it, if they'd use the power of their minds they wouldn't need our assistance!\\").  Looking even further into the future, approximately one year from now people seem to have forgotten all about the Secret (even though \\"the Secret IV\\" has just been published, with all-new \\"scientific\\" evidence that this stuff really works!)  Mostly the book is remembered for its pretty cover and glossy pages and nice-sounding quotations and lumped in with the gazillion \\"Chicken Soul for the Soup\\" books over in the Self Help section.  Meanwhile, rational people around the world continue to \\"discover\\" that hard work usually does pay off, and positive thinking certainly helps, but sometimes bad things happen, and there is a certain amount of luck involved in life, but you CAN make your own luck, but within reason, and you can't just imagine something and it will come right to you.  Who would believe something like that?
B00005JPLU|5.0|A more intense shot of testosterone you will not find in any film. Equal parts bravado, guts and glory, \\"300\\" is simply the most exciting film to come out this year - or in several. Criticized for its violence and gore, fans of Miller's graphic novels will find that violence and gore to be as beautifully depicted on the screen as in the print version. A highly hyped CGI affair the cast could easily have been overcome by the sheer impressiveness of the physical production. To his credit director Zack Snyder is blessed with and uses a cast every bit equal to the challenge of competing with Miller's dark fantastic take of the Spartan's greatest story.     Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, Dear Frankie, etc.) adds yet another impressive and wildly different character to his arsenal of screen roles. As Leonidas, King of Sparta, Butler is, from his pigtail to his muscled, sandled feet, every inch a king; a true leader of men. His passion and intensity is matched by a splendid performance by Lena Headey as his wife, Queen Gorgo. Though a dutiful wife and a woman in an age when being such was near equal to slave status, she is, in her way, as bold and fearless as her husband/King. Dominic West is properly evil and oily as the traitor Theron and he's as nasty and duplicitous a villain as one can hope for. Rodrigo Santoro as a larger-than-life Xerxes is both comical and fearfully creepy equal parts drag queen and wanna be god. Behind all the glitzy piercings and bling, he is little more than self-inflated egotistical child.     While there is blood and gore aplenty, the film also happens to be emotionally satisfying and I found myself with tears welling up in my eyes more than a few times, as well as wanting to raise my fist in the air along with the jacked-up Spartans!  While a macho stoicism pervades their attitudes, there are, to be sure, signs of a greater humanity beneath those ripped abs of Sparta's army - and plenty of heart.     Parallels and allegories are alreadybeing drawn between today's warring world climate, super power dominations and the world of ancient Greece and the Middle East. While this provides an interesting commentary, I heartily recommend leaving that baggage at home and appreciating \\"300\\" on its own and embracing its escapism.     Larry Fong's cinematography ensures that \\"300\\" is eye-poppingly glorious from start to finish - a magnificent feast for the eyes while Tyler Bates's score is guaranteed to keep your adrenaline pumping as it matches - frame-for-frame the visual intensity presented on the screen. While critics are divided on this one, audiences are flocking to it and cheering. For good reason, too: \\"300\\" is magnificent old-fashioned story telling wed to the very best 21st century filmmaking has to offer. See it!
B00005JPCF|4.0|Great movie, could have been better without the politics. I will buy the DVD and then explain to my son when he gets old enough how Hollywood continually attempts to propagandize liberal/socialist points of view in its movies. This movie provides an obvious teaching example about the tendency of the left to force their religious points of view on the rest of us.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We went to a party (with adults) and got cars for the kids to watch in the other room.  I went in to watch the beginning and stayed for the entire movie.  It is the best animated movie I have seen in a long time!  Funny, sweet, and with a great moral.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|Three homless people in Japan find a baby in the trash on Christmas Eve. Humorous as well as tragic and miraculous events take place during their desperate attempt to find the mother and the reason for the baby's apparent abandonment. The human emotions that emerge in the difficult conditions and frustrations that afflict these 3 and those they come in contact with, is timeless reality. Most of us never experience or see these conditions or situations and their presentation in this film truly makes one think as well as laugh. The animation is superior; the story line presentation is priceless. The film is in Japanese with English subtitles and is acted subperbly. A must see.  **Due to certain situations in the film, I don't recommend it for young children.**
B000HC2LIK|5.0|Bladerunner is a paradox in that: the older it gets the fresher it looks. When first released in 1982 it's public reception was luke warm to say the least. Over time, fuelled by it's video and subsequent DVD release, an army of Bladerunner fans have emerged to fight its corner. Some films achieve cult status on a whim and question marks continue to hang over their quality. With Bladerunner this is certainly not the case.<br /><br />Set in 21st century Los Angeles, Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a policeman from an elite unit (Bladerunners) with the remit to hunt down hunanoid robots (Replicants) who attempt to integrate into human society. When several replicants come to earth aiming to infiltrate the company that made them in a bid to extend their lifespan, Deckard is sent to track them down.<br /><br />This cut removes the voice over and upbeat ending prevelent in the original 1982 cinema release and as such the film morphs into a darker and more claustrophobic entity. This enhances Doug Trumball's (2001, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) stunning special effects which easily match any of the CGI work on show today. And Hampton Fancher and David Peoples have crafted a script which forever questions the ethics of creating sentient beings but not allowing for the growth of autonomy or rights.<br /><br />The 25th anniversary cut of Bladerunner is soon due for release but for those who have never journied into this remarkable and uncertain future, this is a memorable introduction.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This moviie was oustanding in several ways. The cinemaphotography was stunning and always contributed to further interest in the film. Dialog was delightful making us always wonder what is going to be said next. But most of all I enjoyed the music. Absolutely breathtaking! Fabulous compositions played impecably. What a wonderful three-way marriage. Film, words, music. A dream come true! Oh, by the way, it is a great story too.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Having grown up with this album on vinyl, I've been consistently disappointed with all the CD releases of this gem.  Buried under overdubs and mountains of reverb (most noticeable on the drums), somebody should've been smacked around for allowing the CDs to be released.  With this re-issue, they finally got it right: crisp, immediate, in your face.  Exactly what I remember from the vinyl but cleaned up.  While the added live tracks are a welcome addition, the sound quality isn't the best.  Nonetheless, this remains, in my opinion, ZZ Top's best work and a must-have.

Barack's life has been a kaleidoscope of experiences, making him a person of understanding and accepting of human nature as such a varied life would allow. Having been to Nairobi, I could easily visualize the descriptions of places he visited. I followed the book by reading \\"Audacity of Hope\\". The combination has given me hope that there may be someone who could actually bring some desparately needed light to this world!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I think I speak for most everyone who appreciated rock and roll in the 70's, especially those of who were happy and impressionable teenagers at the time, when I say that I am moved beyond sadness at the news of the passing of Brad Delp.  The music of Brad and company helped define who I am today, and I feel that a piece has been taken from my soul.  My deep condolences to the family, friends, and fiancée of the late and wonderful Brad Delp, and I know that his voice will be heard until the end of time.
0340840323|2.0|Alice Fancourt comes home and finds her baby replaced by another. What happened? Why doesn't her husband think so, too? Why do all ways of proving the baby's identity come to naught?<br /><br />Sophie Hannah did catch my interest with these questions and also with her way of creating drama by switching back and forth between present and past tense as a style element. I have no children, I don't want any either and so I was suprised how much I did get envolved in the story. And that's why it's not a bad book to borrow from a friend or check out of the library but if you are looking for well written characters that come alive you will be disappointed.
074356619X|2.0|By far this is not the best CD I have heard on this topic.  I think that too many intruptions when intoducing each speaker.  And the accent of the author I found to be very distracting.  I do not recommens this

B00005JNNZ|4.0|At first I thought Coach Carter was going to be another sports movie along the lines of the Mighty Ducks (but in a basketball version) but as the movie goes on, you find out the story it tells is actually pretty deep and has an important message behind it.  The movie is not just about playing basketball and winning games, it's about getting yourself a good education before having fun playing sports.  It's about realizing that basketball is a game you play for fun, while staying in school and learning is more important and more rewarding in the long run.  The ending is the best part.  I won't spoil it, though. <br /> <br />Also, there's another message behind it.  It's to respect the people who are trying their best to help you.  That's what I got out of the movie.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|If you enjoy the Stargate SG-1 series, you will enjoy this spin-off.  Being a big fan myself, my biggest concern was that I wouldn't buy into this new look-alike cutting into the original stargate series--I was wrong.  It is almost completely detatched from the original show, has an all new bigger and badder evil race to battle and has more civilian control, which gives the characters' problem-solving strategies a new perspective.  Plus, they're in another galaxy, and the worlds are completely different!  If you've never seen Stargate before, I suggest you check it out...this show takes off at the end of season 7 on the original series.  Watching SG-1 isn't completely necessary in order to follow this show, but it would help a lot.  One thing about the show that isn't so great is that it seems the producers have gotten a little cheaper on the special effects--the CG is pretty obvious and they use a lot of it.  However, being a TV show, I wouldn't really expect special effects on the same magnitude of major motion pictures.  Also, there's the Atlantis movie floating around...if you're buying the season 1 box set, you don't need to buy the movie.  The movie is just the pilot episode, and it's included in the set, so save your money.  Overall?  Go for it--it's worth checking out at least once!

B00005JPLU|5.0|While war and violence are morally wrong in the abstract human philosophies, shifting cultural sensibilities, and our (USA) pampered day to day existence, It is still part of who we are and it seeps out through our art into our society. We are the way God made us or how we evolved biologically, depending on your views. Either way, we are a violent species. Even if that is lost in the day to day world we live in, there is still an appetite for it. Our art, video games, TV, media, and films serve it up. Since the critics are not artists it is hard for some of them to see the truth of this film and many others released in recent years. Their tunnel vision, sour grapes, or just angry twisted lives make many of them compelled to spit vile upon anything visionary, or even just decent. I have grown tired of reading angry reviews where the reviewer writes as though he or she knows better and almost seems to pity us ignorant peons, lemmings, or what even the hell they consider us to be. Myself, my family, and my friends are not idiots and no where, except perhaps with people who rarely see films, are such conceited, self-important, and egotistic views represented by the people I know within the word I live. This film was great, pure and simple. It will be remembered as a great action film long after the drivel action of the day is forgotten.<br /><br />300 holds you in it's grip from second one to the last scene. It is the sublime beauty of war that Joseph Campbell mentions in his works. Frank Miller has been an artist I have admired since I was a young boy. He has quietly been working away for the last several decades with no huge critical juggernaut coming down on him and suggesting he is pandering to any political dogma of the day. Now that the film is made, which is as close an adaptation as any author could hope for, the liberal critics are there, striking away at a work that spoke to Miller as a child. To suggest any political significance is reaching beyond ones wildest dreams. Real artists do not push political dogma, they represent what is in their soul and hearts. These news paper pandering nancy boys have nothing better to do than regurgitate hogwash in such a backwards fashion that even they themselves are just running in circles and making no real headway with what ever it is they think they should be doing to better this world. 300 is a film not a political movement. To criticize it as if it could convert people into middle East haters is just stupid. The Middle East and the USA do just fine gathering up enemies and haters all on their own. One small film, even one that would be an overt outright bash on either the East or the West would not sway the masses more than a drop in an ocean either way. To point out black and white racist overtones not intended is racist itself.<br /><br />As grand and spectacular as 300 is, it's still just entertainment for popular culture. It's stylized so much that to speak in terms of historical accuracy is just silly. Too many films of our times have passed themselves off as pseudo documentaries in order to effect some kind of cultural awakening or change when all they do is preach to the converted. Films are made in so many ways and varieties that it is just as amusing to watch the critics scramble between \\"Norbit\\" and \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" and all the while trying to maintain some level of intelligence rather than just reviewing films each on it's own merits for what it is and who it's trying to reach. Since so many films these days seem to annoy the critics I often wonder why they are film critics at all. They seem more suited to be writing angry complaint letters to companies about some busted back yard sprinkler. I want reviews, not angry critiques!<br /><br />Go away critics. You are not wanted.

B000E1YVZU|3.0|I didn't see the stage version and wonder if I'd like it any better than the film.  I have mixed feelings about the film.  The cast was very good, there were some terrific scenes, notably the subway car dance with Angel and (? can't remember his name but he was super) and the La Vie Boheme free-for-all.  (Angel grabbed my heart from the start with his/her incredibly beautiful face and huge talent.) Some of the music is good. <br /> <br />On the down side, from my perspective, it seemed fake.  True, it's just a musical and we're not supposed to really \\"believe\\" in them.  But as one who actually lived in \\"Alphabet City\\" I expected something more real.  It was fake blood, fake drugs, fake tragedy, fake ideals. Lots of enthusiasm and intense singing but...somehow it just left me luke-warm. <br />I'm reminded of the one Broadway musical I did make it to in my East Village days---HAIR.  Set during the Viet Nam war, it seemed far more real to me.  This is a pale grandchild of that wonderful show, which was made into an equally wonderful film....same elements...a group of beautiful counter-culture 20-ish kids, with the obligatory mix of races and sexual orientation, colorfully protesting against everything their parents stood for....But HAIR was the original and it was magic.  This is derivative, it's been done already and so I sorta didn't care.  I wept at La Boheme but this version left me dry-eyed.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|this is an excellent film, well acted, fairly well paced, good action and excellent atmosphere. however, the original film, infernal affairs, is much MUCH better. Infernal affairs is by no means an old film, it was released in 2002 or 2003, and you dont need to be an asian cinema fan to enjoy it. it has better camera work, better character development, better action... it is simply a better film. enjoy The Departed, but not before you've seen infernal affairs. <br /> <br />Actually, I was supprised to see just how little credit was given to the original director of infernal affairs, seeing as The Departed is pretty much an exact copy of Infernal affairs.
B00005JPO8|5.0|Many of the reviews already printed here are so good that I have little to add--only to agree with them.  I had hesitated to see this film at first, fearing that it would be too depressing.  True, there are dark aspects of it but the triumph of the human spirit is so bright that one leaves the theater not depressed, but inspired.  Obviously the fact that this chapter of history is still so recent adds to the impact that the movie has on us. I want to urge possible purchasers of this DVD not to steer away from it because of the grim subject matter.  We see clearly the abhorant acts of the East German Stasi and their tragic results.  But this is so much more than a political statement.  It's intensely human.  And, it's even an entertaining thriller!  The twists and turns of the plot kept me fascinated at every moment.  I did not find it at all too long.  The acting is superb.  I don't know their names, but the two male leads---the \\"writer\\" and the \\"spy\\" were perfect.  The transformation that the \\"spy\\" undergoes was brilliantly portrayed.  His eyes seemed even to change color from a dark steel hue in the befinning to a bright blue in the final scene---lovely! The sets were indicative of the theme of the film--the contrast between the stark and sterile apt. of the \\"spy\\" and the lushly colored, warmly furnished home of the \\"writer.\\"  It seems that by spying on \\"the lives of others\\" that a spark of life that had gone out was  rekindled.  How fortunate we are to have a glimpse into the lives of these people.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I am deeply saddened by the passing of Brad Delp.  He has one of the greatest voices in rock n' roll of all-time.  The first Boston album is simply a masterpiece.  It's in there with Back In Black, Dark Side Of The Moon, and others.  Most of us 30 or older have probably owned this album on album, cassette, and CD.  If you are young and a true fan of rock n' roll you MUST own this album.  It's mind blowing to listen to the quality of the production and realize it was released in 1976.  The songs sound as great today as they did the day they were released.  So many people recall some of the best memories around listening to the first Boston album.  In my opinion it's one of the 5 best rock n' roll albums ever made.  On a final note Brad Delp will be sorely missed.  Not only was he the consummate gentleman he had arguably the best voice I've ever heard in rock n' roll.  Rest in peace Brad.  Your music made life a little easier.
0553296981|5.0|I can't even count how many times I have read The Diary of Anne Frank.  I loved this book so much in middle school that I asked for it for Christmas then and got it.  Since then I have read it at least 4 times.<br /><br />It's about a young Jewish girl named Anne Frank who is in hiding with her family and a couple of family friends.  They are hiding from the Nazi's during WW2.  The diary is about what it's like to live in hiding and not being able to go out and do things like normal kids do.  She writes about her first love (Peter) and she writes how she doesn't get along with her mom very well.  It's sad, hopeful and a real page turner.  It will make you grateful for what you have and the freedom you have.  No one should have to go through what this young girl and millions of others had to go through.  It puts life into perspective and I recommend everyone read this book.
B0000214F0|4.0|this movie should be in the video smut section. It's definitely not for prime time viewers. I enjoyed it. I found Malcolm's performance good. Its a good movie to watch with a loved one, like a spouse, significant other or lover.
1582701709|5.0|I am intriqued by where this information is coming from.  Although the Law of Attraction is nothing new and has been advocated by sages for thousands of years as pointed out in The Secret and countless other sources, there has in the last twenty or so years come some fresh and very curious new and different material.  We have (so they say) Advocates from the other side who have experienced many lives here and are now progressing spiritually in another realm that is awaiting our arrival.  They are loving Advocates that are more than willing to share their greater perspective with us for our benefit.   In the 70's and 80's it was Seth speaking thorough Jane Roberts who I believe most will agree ushered in the \\"New Age\\" era.  Also, the famous turn of the century philosopher and author William James who dictated to Jane Roberts his fabulous book, \\"The Afterdeath Journal of an American Philosopher\\".  Now it is Abraham speaking thorough Ester Hicks delivering more of the same sort of material.  Also, now we have Arten & Pursah speaking thorough Gary Renard.  I'm sure there are many more but I have been captivated and enthralled by those mentioned for the last few years.  The thing that is most convincing to me is the fact that I can see no contradiction in any of these sources despite their diversity and they resonate with my credibility completely.  Although, I must confess that I have not been as successful as yet in demonstrating the results as I would like, I nevertheless completely believe in the process.  Abraham says that there is absolutely nothing that happens to us that we have not invited through our thoughts although we may very well not have done so consciously.  He reminds us that when we desire something, we are immediately faced with a dual situation, that of our desire and that of our observations or what is.  What is or what we are observing is what we have attracted by our conditioning so far.  And the reason some of us have more difficulty in creatingsomething different is that we are being influenced more by what we are observing and our ingrained beliefs than we are by our thoughts on what we are desiring.     It seems that most of the discussion here accepts the basic principles of LOA but is particularly non-accepting of the authors comments about fat.  To say that food has nothing to do with weight gain is \\"out there\\".  At least certainly an idea that the populous is not about to accept.  It may very well be true from a \\"pure\\" LOA perspective but none of us are to the point yet that we are not largely influenced by our conditioning, training and daily observations.  So at least for now the statement that food is not an issue is not a practical statement as it relates to our current situation.  However, I don't think this in any way lessens the principle of LOA that simply says that our thoughts and beliefs tend to attract and eventually manifest matching conditions.     I think that saying LOA is not sympathetic to the needy is going off on a tangent.  I don't think most anyone would view the promoters of those who produced The Secret as non-caring individuals.  I believe they are simply saying that teaching new principles is more effective and helpful then any amount of sympathy.  But this would in no way preclude being loving and sympathetic or sharing with them materially or physically.      The statement, if one is an LOA believer then let him jump off a building and depend on his thoughts to override gravity is absurd.  No one is saying that we are capable of creating instantaneous miracles or that we can immediately overcome all ingrained beliefs.    Also, I think it unfair to those involved with The Secret to bash them as just trying to rip off the poor.  I came away feeling that these people were genuinely enthused by their discovery and application of something that worked for them and that they were actually wanting to share the good news with others so that they too could benefit.  Maybe I'm naïve but I wouldn't expect them to write books and etc. without compensation.      Another issue that is giving people difficulty with this idea is the fact that millions are born and die in conditions of abject poverty, squalor, aids, etc.   Are we saying that these people have chosen this situation?  What about the little girl or boy who is stricken with cancer?  Did they choose this?  Our Advocates tell us that we are part of a much larger \\"Self\\" and that we choose various lives to add color and dimision to our otherwise blissful existence because pure bliss is essentially meaningless without non-bliss for contrast.  We may choose favorable or difficult lives for reasons beyond our current perspective.  The question then becomes, which is the determining factor then in the remainder of this life, our life's choice or our new found knowledge of thoughts controlling our reality?  Seth says that nothing is predetermined and that everything is in a state of flux and constantly changing based on our current consciousness.    If one chooses to dismiss all of this as hog-wash then one must ask what then is creating our reality?  Is it simply chance, random circumstances, luck, breeding, wit, etc.?  Is God blessing some more than others because of their worship habits, etc.  Seth says that all events precipitate from consciousness both individually and collectively and that there are no exceptions.  Since belief determines experience, whether you believe it or not you are correct.
1582701709|1.0|The book is lovely enough, with pages that look like old parchment and script and quotes from \\"visionaries\\", however, it is my belief that although there is a basic truth to The Secret theory, there is also much marketing and hype that goes with it. People in this country today, for whatever reaon, are not well in general. More obesity, more heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and perhaps most of all, a basic lack of a sense of themselves. They are unhappy, frustrated, depressed, and they feel hopeless. In these desparate times, people are devouring any and everything that promises to relieve them of the state of mind that they are in. Ironically, there are aspects of The Secret that are true. You do get back what you put out. But not always. You must do it for the sake of being right with yourself and God, not so that you might receive the desires of your heart. Positive thinking is crucial as well. It can shift the way you approach obstacles and people, hence your success and how people treat you. I sum my secret up with this: \\"What do you want to do? What do you want to be? What do you want to have? Who do you want to go with? How the hell do you plan to get there? Write it down. Go do whatever it takes to get it done. Enjoy it. Share it. It doesn't get much simpler than that.\\" -Lee Iacocca That's what I love about it. You establish goals and DO whatever it takes to achieve them. How and when God honors our efforts is not ours to attempt to control, however, if we approach our efforts with honor and integrity, the result, whatever it might be, will be in our best interest.
B000QXDED6|5.0|This movie is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name in which the story is loosley based on the Battle of Thermopylae that took place in Greece during the summer of 480 B.C.E.     In this film, Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartan warriors fight to the last man against the massive army of Persian King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Facing insurmountable odds, the Spartans' fierce resistance inspires all of Greece to unite against the middle eastern invaders.     Frank Miller is also the artist and author of other notable comics like \\"Sin City\\" that was adapted for the silver screen, \\"Batman: Year One\\" that the script for \\"Batman Returns\\" was loosely based on, respectfully. He is one of my favorite comic book artists.     I read \\"300\\" when it first came out and knew what to expect. The action is fantastic and the costumes and real-life sets are very well done. While not much effort is put into the acting, the actors and actresses all do a good job with their roles none-the-less. Hopefully, Frank Miller will be pleased with the film's outcome and it was rightfully a blockbuster at the box office.
0743289412|1.0|I'm not one of those people who sours on authors who want to \\"try something new.\\"  I read every book and judge it invidually.  I'm not somebody who's going to read every new Stephen King book and then scoff, \\"Well, it wasn't as good as 'Pet Sematary'.\\" <br /> <br />With that said, judging \\"Lisey's Story\\" on its own isn't too difficult.  I can't say that I liked it.  The made-up words were excessive.  I understand that every relationship has its inside jokes, but Scott and Lisey practically had their own language.  It felt as though King were trying to too hard with all the made-up terms trying to convince the reader that these were special and unique characters.  After a while I felt as though he should have included a dictionary I could go back and refer to every time one of his concocted terms popped up. <br /> <br />The flashbacks were annoying.  Sometime Lisey would flashback when she was already *in* a flashback.  I lost track of which \\"time\\" he was writing from quite often. <br /> <br />Lisey is the heroine of this story, but about halfway through I was starting to root for Jim Dooley to come in and finish her off.  I was tired of the constant internal diologue and the silent conversations with her husband.  I understand that she was a new widow, but she was a bit on the whiny side. <br /> <br />Ironically Steven King acknowledges his editor in the author's notes, when this book would have been vastly improved by cutting out 150-200 pages of it. <br /> <br />The only reason I have it one star was because I liked the idea of Boo'ya Moon, and I would have liked reading more about that instead of hearing more of Lisey's internal dialogue.

1582701709|1.0|Inasmuch as a positive attitude works better than a negative one, no matter how you visualize, strategize, imaginize, and otherwise cogitate, meditate, or exfoliate,a person born with no arms, a person in a terrible prison being mistreted, or a person living in abject poverty in an underdeveloped country, will not achieve riches. You can thunk it as much as you can, but the reality is that you most likely will be stuck. People, you and me, are eager for some real relief from the stressors of the modern world, hence their eagerness to find a solution, a \\"secret\\". I won't condemn a genuine attempt at offering a solution to our life, but without faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, all that stuff is nothing but wishful thinking. No, man does not create his own mission, no, man is not the captain of his ship. God is and unless and until a person acknowleges God's supremacy in his life, even if he accumulates all the wealth in the world, he will be lost on that day when he meets his Maker. \\"Fool, tonight your soul will be required of you.\\" Luke 12:20. Read that passage in Luke, make the Lord Jesus preeminent in your life, and get on your knees and ask the Lord to forgive you. Then you will have truly responded to the \\"secret\\" of the ages: God becoming a man to take your place for your sin. Ignore this secret and you will pay the eternal consequences.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I like this movie and have seen it several times. Like another reviewer, I would compare it to \\"She's All That\\" which I have also seen. This movie is a half star better than \\"She's All That\\".<br /><br />Kat and Bianca live with their father, an OB/GYN, whose wife left him. He is raising his daughters alone. He's very caring father, though very strick both because of his profession and his abandonment by his wife.<br /><br />Bianca, who is younger than Kat and a certified flirt, is not allowed by her father to date unless Kat is dating.  But Kat refuses to date anyone. She is cynical and unhappy though it is obvious that she is very intelligent (much more so than Bianca). She's very unpopular at school; even her English teacher doesn't like her. Something has happened to Kat to make her cynical and bitter, but what?  We find out much later in the film.<br /><br />Cameron, who has been tutoring Bianca in French, is infatuated with Bianca and wants to date her. He and his friend Michael (a geeky kind of guy) devise a scheme to find a date for Kat. No one will accept their proposal except Patrick who is the most unpopular tough-guy/loner at the high school (he lights his cigarettes with a blow torch in one scene). The school rumor is that Patrick was in prison at one time. Though frightened of Patrick, they approach him and convince Patrick to work on getting a date with Kat by tricking Joey, an egotistical guy with plenty of money who also wants to date Bianca, into bribing Patrick.<br /><br />It takes Patrick quite a while to make it through the wall Kat has thrown up to keep everyone at arms length. Kat hates Patrick at first but his persistence pays off.<br /><br />The scenes between Patrick and Kat, as their relationship develops, are charming. My favorite scenes are the book store scene, Patrick's tenderness to Kat after she gets herself drunk at a party, the paint ball scene, the music store scene, and most especially the scene where Patrick sings to Kat from the bleachers while she is in gym class playing soccer.<br /><br />Why did I give this movie 4 stars if I liked it so much? Because this movie is an very loose adaptation based on Shakespeare's play \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\". In comparison with \\"Clueless\\", another teen romance movie which is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\", this movie falls just short of the perfection of \\"Clueless\\".

B0006L0LOS|2.0|The performers did as good a job as they could with the material they were forced to work with, and if you want to see Halle Berry at her most breathtaking, this film is worth a look. It's not a well-written script, which is a shame, because if the story had even been just a LITTLE better, this would have been a great film. Instead, we can enjoy it for the campy pile of glitz that it turned out to be.

I was utterly captivated by the plot, one which has many layers to it...Vida Winter is a dying writer who wishes that another writer write her biography, yet there are so many mysteries lurking, and puzzles to be unravelled that the writer chosen by Vida finds herself uncovering more than she bargained for as she goes about unearthing Vida's past...there is definitely a Gothic feel to Ms Setterfield's writing, it brings to mind novels like Rebecca, Wuthering Heights, Northanger Abbey and even lesser known Gothic romances...utterly compelling and compulsively readable!
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I wrestle with the debate over the best auto racing movie made. To me, the reasons that makes Grand Prix the winner over LeMans are two: First, Grand Prix had a plot. Second, cinematography for that era 1966 was outstanding. If you ever saw the chopped up Ford GT-40 race car driven by Bob Bondurant that did much of the car-to car shots carrying a monster film camera and a maze of rigging and look at the on-screen result, it's truly amazing. The racing sounds and music score, when played through a decent home theatre system is extremely satisfying. I saw this film long ago when first released on the wide screen and it still impresses me today.

006074815X|4.0|This is an older Ken Follett book that I only now had the chance to read.  It is a fascinating account of the story behind the story at D-Day. Some may disagree, but I think D-Day was the most important day in 2000 years. Men whose countries were not occupied, e.g. US, Britain, and Canada made incredible sacrifices to free the occupied countries.  Unfortunately it seems to have not been appreciated or remembered. <br /> <br />It is true that General George S. Patton of the US First Army was playing a dramatic role in convincing the Germans that the attack would come at Calais, and not at Normandy.  Follett runs with that fact, and constructs a fascinating story of how the Allied subterfuge was built and maintained. In Eye of the Needle, one German spy, a sleeper living in London for years, discovers the truth.   <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, the British hunt him down, chasing him all over England and Scotland.  Fortunately for the Allies, the German spy ultimately meets his match in a love-lorn English housewife living on a remote island.  <br /> <br />This is one of Follett's earlier works. It is clear that he has improved with each book. His first works were unreadable. This is a good story concept with great characters, but the transitions are very rough, and almost everything happens in the last 10 pages. Key to Rebecca is better, but read this also.

In it she shares information about her travels, as well as the meaning behind each song.  Her ability & choice to share these stories & explain her thought/heart processes to her listeners makes her music all the more powerful.<br /><br />I do have to admit that some parts of this CD sound the same as (or at least very similar to) music included on prior CD's.  Although it's noticable, I didn't find that it took anything away from the \\"newness\\" of \\"An Ancient Muse\\".<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be another awesome Loreena McKennitt CD & I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys celtic music - it won't disappoint!

B000M4RG42|1.0|I should mention several things before writing this article.  First, I love Clint Eastwood and have been a big fan of his since I was a boy.  I've enjoyed watching how his directing has matured.  Secondly I am a \\"history buff\\" and love WWII and films about it.  Thirdly, I read the book that this movie was based on about a year ago.  I had looked forward to reading the book very much, wanting to learn more about the battle of Iwo Jima.  I was quite disappointed in the book, finding it boring, and overly focused on events before and after the battle (the battle itself seems to be given the bum's rush as if it's an inconvenient intruder on the story of the author's father.)  I had hoped that Eastwood's skill as a director might help to undo some of the book's flaws.<br /><br />Sadly, not only does Eastwood fail to fix the book's flaws, the flow of this movie compounds on it.  The one thing I can credit the book with is that it generally told the story in a linear fashion, even if it rushes through the battle with its eyes closed.  Eastwood instead decides to flash back and forward between the battle and the three flag-raising survivors' subsequent war bonds tour.  The result is a disjointed, dispirted and frankly boring piece of work that does not do justice to the men who gave their lives at Iwo Jima.  The battle itself seems to get even shorter thrift in the movie than in the book.  The style robs the battle of any congruence so that you never know where the soldiers are, why they are there, how they got there and what obstaces they faced to achieve what they did.<br /><br />Perhaps the most glaring example of this is when the movie covers the deaths of several of the flag raisers in a series of brief (1 to 2 minutes, sometimes as little as 10-20 seconds) flashbacks to the battle.  It's almost as if Eastwood is simply impatient to get rid of them so he can return to the \\"point\\" of how they were constructed as heroes after the battle.<br /><br />The narration is completely unnecessary, stealing the most saccarine moments from \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (the corny \\"present day\\" intro and ending) and preaching to the audience.<br /><br />In short, if you're hoping to see a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima, this is not it.  I suspect this movie does little justice to the experience of the soldier's on the American side.  I can only hope that the Japanese side gets a better touch in \\"Letters from Iwo Jima.\\"completely unnecessary, stealing the most saccarine moments from \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (the corny \\"present day\\" intro and ending) and preaching to the audience. <br /> <br />In short, if you're hoping to see a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima, this is not it.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|I was not too sure what to expect from this movie.  Perhaps because of Will Ferrell I assumed a sort of romatic comedy.  It was light-hearted, but I wouldn't quite call it a comedy.  It had its romatic moments, but I wouldn't quite call it a romance either.  It was really just a story about how a man breaks out of his routine and finds himself in the process.<br /><br />The movie chronicles the life of Harold Crick, played by Ferrell - an IRS auditor in Chicago who lives a very regimented, almost obsessive/compulsive existence where he counts everything (steps to the bus stop, numbers of strokes with his toothbrush, minutes/seconds in his lunchbreak, etc.). His life is one of lonely monotony where he has few friends and almost no life outside of his job.  One day, he begins hearing a woman's voice as he's getting ready for work - a voice that is narrating his every move in life.  He breaks out of his day-to-day routine as he tries to find the writer (played by Emma Thompson) who is narrating his life, eventually learning that her name is Karen Eiffel and confronting her face-to-face.  There, he learns that in her previous eight novels that the main character always dies tragically at the end of the book.  Crick must then come to grips with the strange reality that his life is being crafted by someone else and that his own death has been pre-ordained.  Meanwhile, Eiffel comes to grips with the fact that her latest novel is actually deciding the fate of a living, breathing human being - not just a figment of her imagination.  She has a dilemma: decide between publishing her best book ever with her signature ending of tragedy, or settle for a mediocre ending where she allows her main character to live on \\"happily ever after\\" for the first time - all while understanding that her pen will decide the fate of the real Mr. Crick.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending - you'll just have to watch to see whether it's a tear-jerker or a ray of sunshine, but rest assured that either way, it results in a delightful story.<br /><br />The real star here was Zach Helm (the writer) who put together a truly charming screenplay that, although quirky, was very touching without being sappy.  But equally deserving of praise was Ferrell who played the part of Harold Crick perfectly, giving us a shy, withdrawn, and lovable character who is completely unlike his over-the-top stand-up comedic persona.  And, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who delivers a very nice performance as a counter-culture bakery owner that Crick is sent to audit.  Her character ends up having a major influence in Crick's life, and vice-versa.  Because I grew up in a counter-culture town (Ashland, Oregon), I've seen my share of counter-culture folks and Gyllenhaal plays the role of earthy, politically outspoken, counter-culture restaurant owner with an attitude to a \\"T\\" - replete with tatoos, socialist leanings, and probably a pair of Birkenstock sandals hiding in her closet somewhere.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Hoffman and Thompson play lesser roles in this film, and I found myself somewhat surprised that Hoffman in particular actually agreed to such a small part.  But I think that is testimony to the extraordinary strength of Helm's screenplay.  Indeed, in the \\"extras\\" feature on the DVD, Thompson comments on this and notes that she wasn't 3 pages into the script before she wanted in.<br /><br />It was a delightful, satisfying way to spend a couple hours.  I found it wholesome and redeeming as Crick is truly a good-hearted fellow who we grow to love as the film progresses through his good-natured and selfless manner.  It has none of the zaniness that we've come to expect from Ferrell and established him as a very capable dramatic actor.ults in a delightful story.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jones's first two albums sold some 17 million and 10 million copies respectively, the kind of diminishing returns that even the flintiest of record company accountants can accept.     Whether that level can be sustained with \\"Not Too Late\\" remains to be seen, but the subtle changes to her style here seem like a shrewd attempt to expand artistically without disturbing her core audience, most of whom will still be in the long, deep sleep triggered by her previous albums, anyway.     That lullaby effect continues here - there's even a song called \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" - but it's what's happening at the fringes of the record that's most interesting: things like the unusually intimate string arrangement created by The Kronos Quartet for \\"Broken\\", and the New Orleans rumba-rock undercarriage to \\"Be My Somebody\\", and its snaking slide-guitar break with the faintest of scorched edges.     There are still plenty of languid cabaret shuffles, piano ballads and neutered blues, but few are as effective as \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", where Norah's joined by the simpatico M Ward on a stalking cakewalk of banjo, piano and sleazy muted trumpet.       The highlights of this album, in my opinion , are: \\"Sinkin' Soon\\", \\"Be My Somebody\\", \\"Broken\\".
0140120416|5.0|There's not much I can add to what all the other reviewers have already said.  I'm an expat living in Russia for a year so far and I'm currently taking classes using a different text (Ben Clark), and I still pull this book out regularly.  People of course have many different learning styles and I guess for some genius polyglots, this may not be the best method, but for me the material seems to have a very organic presentation to it.  It's certainly not a phrasebook, but the author does tend to present commonly used words and phrases as earlier in the text rather than later.  This is a serious book and you can expect to be doing some concentrated studying if you want enjoy its full benefit.  I highly recommend this book and it's some of the best money I've spent before coming here. <br />

B000NA28IE|2.0|It seems that every plot element from Star Wars is in this movie.  Farm boy (Eragon, Luke) finds something (egg, droids) that somebody powerful wants (King, Emperor).  The search is done by a powerful second-in-command (Durza, Darth Vader).  The farm boy's uncle is killed.  A older mentor shows up (Brom, Ben Kenobi), who teaches the boy about (magic, the force).  There's even a princess and a rebel base waiting for a final attack.  Continue this with the rest of the plot and you will see that this story mirrors Star Wars.  Amazing that this kind of derivative book/movie made it past any respectable publisher/producer.  My eight-year-old son even delighted in finding the similarities to Star Wars.   Don't bother with this.  Watch (or read) something original.

6305263248|4.0|Ronin is a lesson in how to combine minimalism with an effort to be all things at once.  Ronin works well as a heist picture, and as such can be put on a double-bill with Ocean's Eleven.  Ronin is a relentless action extravaganza that pairs off well with Speed.  Ronin is part espionage thriller, and could be watched along with one of the Mission Impossible movies.  Or, forget about Ocean's Eleven, Speed, and Mission Impossible, and just watch Ronin, especially if you haven't seen it.    In Paris, an Irish woman called Deirdre hires several cloak-and-dagger types, of varying backgrounds, to steal a mysterious briefcase from some fella who wants to sell it to some Russian bidders.  A natural leader of the team emerges--Sam, played by Robert De Niro.  Even the early scenes, where Sam meets his edgy associates and quietly takes their measure, allow us to see how formidable an opponent he would make for anyone trying to hang onto invaluable luggage, or anyone who might be thinking of double-crossing him.  We see he is no stranger to black-bag operations, he is not afraid to ask key questions that may save his life, he knows how to smile and keep his own secrets so they can't be used against him, he assesses peoples' weak points from a few hints, and he is a master of anticipating what lies ahead and laying contingency plans.  This comes to serve him in great stead when the mission goes horribly wrong and he can't manage to liberate the invaluable suitcase and people double-cross him.  Various picturesque areas of France come off the worse for the resulting car chases, gun battles, hostage-grabbings, sniper attacks, slashings and beatings.  Sam and Vincent--Vincent (Jean Reno) seeming to be the only teammate he can trust--fight their way through all obstacles but never manage to get within about ten feet of the precious case before fate, or a betrayer, takes it beyond their grasp.  Then all of Sam's smarts can't help him as he takes a bullet through a bullet-proof vest.This film is a sleek, streamlined affair that does not have the time or interest in letting us know too much about the characters.  From a person's accent, some lines of chitchat or verbal sparring, one has to fill in the gaps, between cars streaking by or shootouts erupting in the streets.  Always, always, it is about pursuing the prize past the bloody victims of whomever has decided to grab the briefcase and run.  The plot thrives because things go wrong--unlike watching Ocean's Eleven where we are to be dazzled by everything going right.  And things go wrong to excess in Ronin because no one does what they are supposed to do, everyone has their own agenda, everyone wants to win big by keeping the payoff money and the briefcase.  Sam plays this game very well but soon there is so much chaos that it is unclear whether he will live long enough to see what is in the case.    The actors--De Niro, Jean Reno, Sean Bean, Stellan Skarsgard, and Natascha McElhone, among other familiar faces--all bow to the briefcase's domination of their enclosed and violent world, and with their edgy, tight-lipped, shifty-eyed, sometimes paranoid, interaction, make us interested in who they are and what will happen to them, despite complete dossiers on them being denied us.  Even the film Speed gave us more human-interest stuff than what we get in Ronin, so if you really want to be hanging on by the tips of your fingers while a film races along, forget Speed.  And if you're more curious about what ex-spies and disgraced spooks do to earn money and get the thrill of danger than you are about pretty-boy goody-goody type spies with everlasting consciences, then pick Ronin over MI3.     What was in the briefcase everyone wants: maybe a copy of Ronin.  Enjoy.
B000M4RG4C|5.0|Saddle up boys, lock and load  Beth Willis  3/10/2007    John Wayne was probably just as famous for his big screen persona and movies, as he was for  his love of America. I idolized him. Ok, so I thought he was pretty handsome, too.     So, when I heard that they were remaking a movie about Iwo Jima, I thought, how could they improve on something already done, \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\". Wayne got an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Sergeant Stryker, a Marine with a tough exterior and a heart. He taught his \\"boys\\" how to be a Marine and how to survive. Tough love was his method and by the end of the movie, when he was killed, even his opponents understood his impact on their survival. The flag was raised on Mt. Suribachi. The film began with a written memorial on the screen for the Marines that fought in WWII with patriotic background music. It ended with more patriotic music and the understanding of how proud we should be of the men that fought.     It was a great movie to honor the soldiers of WWII Pacific, only the movie only told part of the story.     I was reluctant to give the movie Flags of our Fathers a chance, and didn't see it in the theater. Didn't seem to find the time. I had read information about the flag raisers on the Internet and wondered how much more there was to talk about these young boys that I had already read about. Boy was I wrong.     I bought the paperback, Flags of our Fathers. The beginning is a recap of the history of the boys that raised the \\"2nd\\" flag on Mt. Suribachi. I already knew that, but continued to read. It just got better and better. James Brady gave such a good description of the Marine ethic and Semper Fidelis, that I just wanted to hug a Marine after reading about their courage to serve against the worst odds. Then I read about the battle on Tarawa. That was brutal. The next battle was Iwo Jima. We thought there might be 12,000 Japs/Nips on the island. We were wrong. There were over 20,000 dug into the island in a massive hive up to 7 levels deep. The had hidden bunkers that just fired away. We lost so many soldiers. Battleships were shelling the island with little effect. It was the Marines that just kept coming and coming ashore to take the island. The Flag was raised twice on the 4thd day. The 2nd raising was on the front page of every paper. US Citizens rallied when they saw that picture of such bravery. For many Americans, that picture was hung on the wall in their homes.        The battle raged for another 30 some days. 3 of the six flag raisers were killed on the island. The Sergeant Stryker character from \\"Sands\\" was a flag raiser. He was killed by friendly fire. He was just as tough as \\"Wayne\\", but had a soft side. He told his boys, \\"Follow my orders and I will get you back to your Mothers\\". These were mostly kids, dying before they lived.     The 3 remaining flag raisers went on a national tour for the 7th bond drive. When WWII was fought, citizens purchased bonds to support the war.      When the 3 flag raisers returned home they were on their own. There was no GI bill to help educate those returning. There was no post traumatic stress help. Brady had a job as a mortician, Hayes drank himself to death, and Gagnon rose to become a janitor.     I just wanted to cry for these boys. Brady never told anyone about the experience. Never discussed his awards. Never let anyone know the humanity he helped as a corpsman and those that he couldn't. He lost a friend to the Japs and found him tortured. Eyes gouged out, finger nails ripped off, ears cut off, and his penis in his mouth.     If there was ever a reason to nuke these [...], it was their cruelty and just out right inhuman mentality.       I bought the movie. It is a great representation of the book.      Wayne and \\"Sands\\" gave us insight into the war, but Brady and \\"Flags\\" gave us total reality. I certainly understand now why my Father and others didn't want to talk about WWII. Who would want to remember the atrocities? We WON and it was because of a whole generation of young kids.       Hug a Vet.
6305428220|3.0|This movie got my attention and I watched it on teevee, it had good elements of Body Snatchers, The Thing, and a little Alien and a little Terminator.  The acting was very good, action was very good, I enjoyed it overall.  But the happy ending of everybody coming back alive and the world being good again betrayed the viscerable horror concepts that gave birth to this movie.  This was fun to watch, but the axed Pollyanna ending was very disappointing.
B00005JPLU|5.0|\\"300\\" is excellent! The cast led by Gerard Butler, is great. The directing by Zack Snyder (who also directed \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" (2004) & the upcoming \\"Watchmen\\" (2008) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (who is also known for his other creations, such as Daredevil, Elektra, Batman, and Robocop), who also wrote the graphic novel \\"Sin City\\" (2005) and co-directed the movie with Robert Rodriguez and Lynn Varley) by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, & Michael Gordon is excellent. The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" & the upcoming \\"Watchmen\\") is excellent. The cinematography by Larry Fong is excellent. The film editing by William Hoy (who also did the film editing to \\"Fantastic Four\\" (2005) & the upcoming \\"Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer\\" (2007) is excellent. The casting by Kristy Carlson, Carrie Hilton, Andrea Kenyon, & Tamara Notcutt is great. The production design by James D. Bissell (who also did the Oscar-nominated production design to \\"Good Night And Good Luck.\\" (2005) is excellent. The art direction by Isabelle Guay, Nicolas Lepage, & Jean-Pierre Paquet (all three also did the art direction to \\"The Fountain\\" (2006) is excellent. The set decoration by Paul Hotte (who also did the set decoration to \\"The Fountain\\") is excellent. The costume design by Michael Wilkinson (who also did the costume design to \\"Babel\\" (2006) is excellent. This is an excellent movie that is faithful to the graphic novel, just like Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" adaptation was.
1582701709|5.0|Loved it Loved it Loved it.! <br />Only one thing that was a bit off. The print was a bit hard to read partly because of the patterned paper.  <br />The message however is one we all need to pay attention too. Many Thanks.  LJL
1582701709|5.0|This book reminded me of many things I already knew, but put into a different format that it all clicked. Wonderful book.
0783240287|5.0|I bought this because I am taking my 9 year old and 7 year old granddaughters to see the play.  They have watched it so often, they know all the words and when their friends come over, they all watch it together. It was great to get it easily on line without having to search the stores for it.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a brilliant movie. There is not one wasted scene. For me, this movie is about taking time out to enjoy life, taking chances, and just remembering that you don't have to take yourself so seriously. I've seen this movie many times, since it came out in the mid 80s. I never get tired of it. <br /> <br />The DVD with special features is especially great to have--there are some interviews of the cast that were filmed when the movie was made. I was disappointed that there wasn't much current material with John Hughes, but there is plenty of footage of him back in the day. There are interviews with Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Jeffrey Jones (the principal), Edie McClurg (school secretary), Ben Stein (Beuller, Bueller), and Cindy Pickett & Lyman Ward (Bueller's parents--did you know they were dating when they made the movie, and later became married?), and Jennifer Grey.  <br /> <br />Ben Stein has some special features that only he could pull off. I love this movie so much I'm going to buy a DVD for many of the people I know. I'm going to tell them to watch this movie every once in a while. It makes you feel good and refuels the zest for trying something new or fun...and taking time out to enjoy life once in a while. Thanks to all the creative folks who made this movie. And to John Hughes who really nails it.  <br /> <br />Buy this DVD and keep it in your library. Watch it once a year. It's therapeutic!
0767827902|5.0|When \\"The Last Picture Show\\" was first released, it was hailed as one of the best debut films by an American director since \\"Citizen Kane.\\" Odd, since \\"Citizen Kane\\" is #1 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 list and \\"The Last Picture Show\\" is nowhere to be found. Since it is in the 400 nominees for the 10th anniversary edition of that list, maybe it will make it this time. It certainly deserves to. The film is based on a novel by Oscar winner Larry McMurtry (Best Adapted Screenplay, 'Brokeback Mountain') and is written by McMurtry and director Peter Bogdanovich. The movie takes place in a small, desolate Texas town where the only thing to do is go to school, play sports, and see a movie. No one knows this better than Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and his friends. Sonny is a typical high school senior. He hangs out with his friends, usually Duane (Jeff Bridges), chills with his girlfriend, and worries about his future. Especially since almost no one in the town has much of a future. Bogdanovich hammers this message down, mostly with the black & white cinematography. Despite having a crush on Duane's slutty girlfriend Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), Sonny begins having an affair with his football coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman, who deservedly won an Oscar her role). Probably the most memorable character in the film is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson, who also won an Oscar for his role) the man who owns the movie theatre, the diner, and pool hall frequented by almost everyone in the town. Sam also, for the most part, acts as the moral conscience of the town. The character is given some of the best dialogue. The performances in this film are all so good. You can not imagine one other person playing the roles in the film. One thing I kept noticing while watching the film is how hot Cybill Shepherd was back in the day. \\"The Last Picture Show\\" is a masterpiece of cinema that deserves a lot more props for how good it is. It's regarded as a classic, but isn't a solidified one. The movie does everything so well to illustrate its story and the desperation of all the characters to get away. From the black & white atmosphere to the dull-ness of everything. Not a single scene in the film seems forced or un-needed (although it could be argued the film has gratuitous nudity, but who cares?). If you haven't seen \\"The Last Picture Show\\" you should, because it's a great film and it's very memorable, you won't regret watching it. <br /> <br />GRADE: A
B000MCH5P4|5.0|\\"Babel\\" was nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture and had previously won the Best Picture Golden Globe. I'm usually pretty good at predicting the Best Picture winner at the Oscars, but this year was difficult. I thought it was a toss-up between The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine, and Babel. Well, The Departed won 4 Oscars and Babel won one (Best Original Score)...Never the less, \\"Babel\\" is one of the best films of 2006. It's directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and written by Guillermo Arriaga, the same writer/director team behind \\"Amores Perros\\" and \\"21 Grams.\\" I thought \\"21 Grams\\" was the fourth best film of the year, the year it came out...\\"Babel\\" is just as good, if not better. It takes place in four countries (mostly in 3), it's in 4 languages, and is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the most important. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett play Richard and Susan, a rich couple touring Morocco. Their marriage is on the rocks and something tragic has recently happened to them. Things take a turn for the worst when two young boys, armed with a rifle, accidentally shoot her from a mountaintop. The shooting, which is believed to be the work of terrorists, is suddenly all over the news and Richard is fighting to keep Susan alive even though he can't get her to a hospital or get an ambulance to get her. In San Diego, California where their nanny Amelia (Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza) is watching their two children Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), while trying to figure out a way to make it to her sons wedding in Mexico. When she can't find anyone to look after the children, she has her nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal) take her and the children to Mexico. Everything goes smoothly until they run into problems at the border on the way back. Millions of miles away in Japan is Chieko (Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuechi), a deaf and mute girl yearning for attention from both her father and other men. This movie presented atruly surprising year at the Academy Awards. Unknowns' Barraza and Kikuechi were nominated for Oscars, while leading man Pitt was shut out. Watching the film, it's easy to see why. Barraza is probably the actress that most deserved the Oscar this year (although I haven't seen \\"Dreamgirls\\" so my opinion is a bit unfounded). Kikuechi doesn't say a word in the film and yet delivers one of the best performances of the year. Brad Pitt delivers his best performance ever and I'm surprised after watching it he didn't get an Oscar nomination. Even though he wouldn't have beat Forest Whitaker or Peter O'Toole, I'm surprised his performance didn't even get noticed. \\"Babel\\" was an Oscar front-runner, but it actually got mixed reviews. It ended up on a lot of top ten lists, but a lot of critics (namely A.O. Scott and Michael Phillips) shut the film out. It is a film that won't appeal to the average American audience, because Americans don't like to read movies but this is a great film that I think some people would benefit from seeing. It has a lot to say about America and people, although I found a revelation at the end of the film to be a little confusing. The movie runs 135 minutes, but feels much shorter because it breezes through these stories and never overstays its welcome. The Oscar-winning score is terrific and, even, at times, haunting. <br /> <br />GRADE: A-
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is a great CD!  My husband bought it for me, and I loved it so much I bought another for the friend that went to the Musical with me.  The music helps you pick up on the little things that you might have missed at the show.  It keeps taking me back there!
032147404X|5.0|I recently made the jump from point-and-shoot to prosumer and I wanted to find out more about the business of taking photographs. I therefore (i) spent a lot of time reading DP sites on the web, and, (ii) bought three books: this book, Miotke's Betterphoto book, and Tom Ang's DK book.  <br /> <br />This is the only book of the three which I'd rate as excellent in all respects (on Amazon, Miotke's book has a higher rating than this book; I have no idea why).  <br /> <br />If you buy one book about digital photography, make it this one. There are eleven chapters: <br /> <br />(1) Getting sharp photos, (2) Shooting flowers, (3) Shooting weddings, (4) Shooting landscapes, (5) Shooting sports, (6) Shooting people, (7) Avoiding problems, (8) Taking advantage of digital, (9) Travel & city life shots, (10) Printing, (11) Photo recipes. <br /> <br />Each chapter consists of a number of (usually one page) topics which are easy to read and quite addictive (I read the whole book cover to cover,  <br />excluding the last two chapters, in one sitting). Some examples include:  <br /> <br />Turn off vibration reduction, Don't wait for rain --- fake it!, Formals: Who to shoot first, Become married to your tripod, Shooting on cloudy days, Pre-focus to get the shot, Which aperture to use, Cold weather shooting means extra batteries, Change your ISO on the fly, Showing movement in the city, and so on.  <br /> <br />This book contains nearly 200 tips. It's fun to read. The advice is clear and very, very specific (down to tips on which pieces of equipment to buy). I'm going on holiday to Australia in a few days and this and the camera manual will be the only two camera books I take with me. Please believe me: this book really is that good! Buy it!

0142403873|5.0|This is a classic children's picture book, up there with \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" and \\"Goodnight, Moon.\\"  The story is enchanting, the pictures fascinating with lots to look at, and it's the kind of book that can be read dozens of times without either the child or the adult getting tired of it.  I first heard of it on a visit to England, where it is famous on a par with Winnie-the-Pooh or classics like that.  They even present it as a play, which travels around to cities every year.  My little boy has loved it since he was two -- he's five now.  He especially loves the way the mouse bamboozles all the other animals with tales of the supposed Gruffalo's favorite dishes, such as \\"owl ice cream.\\"  Every child should have this book!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|The best show ever on the WB or CW whatever they want to call it now. They should've kept it going and just finished off, that stupid 7th Heaven.
1582701709|5.0|I loved this book -the bible says, \\"Ask and ye shall receive\\" which corresponds with this book - it's about the law of attraction - we should strive to be positive in order to attract positive things in our lives. <br /> <br />It's the type of book you can just open and read that page for the day. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.
0142000655|5.0|This is a marvelous opus into which you can really sink your teeth!  Of course, I had seen the famous James Dean film version, but had no previous idea of what an expansive, sweeping epic it had been based on--- the book far surpasses the wonderful film.  The incredible gift Steinbeck has for storytelling, the classic yet complex characters and the dramatic, original storylines will sweep you up page after page after page.<br /><br />It's especially satisfying to find a juicy read that lasts so long (this edition @ 600 pages) to bring you a fulfilling reading experience you can savor.  The author's many pearls of wisdom and insightful spin on the Cain & Abel story will stay with you long after you finish.  It's also a fascinating look at the foibles and fortunes of early 20th Century Americans.  It's a book to enjoy and to share.<br /><br />I can't believe it took me so long to discover this literary treasure, which quickly leapt to the Top 10 List of my all-time favorites.
B00009W0U4|3.0|Good story, albeit told backwards, two extremely violent scenes, one very cool, one (the rape scene) not exactly a pleasant view, and dizzying and sometimes nonsensical camera work, make for an interesting movie.  Not great, but interesting.
0743496728|3.0|I am a Picoult fan, a parent and a teacher.  Perhaps that makes me easier to disappoint. <br />  <br />This novel seems less researched than most of her works, and often takes the easy route.  Perhaps she and her editor were not enamoured with the conflicts or characters of Nineteen Minutes, and therefore rushed to finish.  It may be due to my familiarity with her writing style/patterns, but I was able to predict the course of the plot and its denoument quite early in the book.  <br /> <br />A deft and meticulous editor could have made this a more successful novel.  At one point, Picoult writes that the Houghton family bought a dog when their youngest son was THREE.  Two pages later, there is a memory of the same dog and son  playing when he was TWO.  Even tiny errors make an editor and author appear lazy. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I was riveted.  Picoult's insights regarding human nature and the bonds we form (or fail to) are persistent and potent.  I will continue to read Picoult's work, and I will pass this book along to friends and family.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbar is always a good buy.  This showes how she can sing with so many different people and pull it off.  Ever with her self. What more could I say?
B000F3UAFC|2.0|Viturally every other sentence is borrowed/stolen from Wilde's other works. \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" seems to be a favorite of this film's writer. Uninspired, to say the least!
1582701709|1.0|This reads like one of the books that promise you that you can lose weight without restricting your food intake or exercising, except that it targets more than just your weight. <br /> <br />Let me elaborate.  When the foundation is already there, attitude is important.  A talented, hard-working person with a positive attitude is more likely to succeed than a similar person with a self-defeatist attitude.  But, unfortunately, just wanting something very badly is not a shortcut to getting it - it's not a substitute for talent and hard work.  There are no shortcuts.
1582701709|5.0|An easy read loaded with positive, but simple techniques that are life changing.  I'm learning to focus on the things that I want, rather than expending energy on the things that I don't want.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|The central theme of Babel was extraordinarily expressed in layers of communications broken, misunderstood, ignored and the most precious restored, taking the viewers through a labyrinth of emotional turmoil so disturbingly strong one could in a variety of moments imagine propelling themselves into the action to right the situation. I was first disappointed in this movie due to the fact that Brad Pitt was nominated for leading male, but his character was not of Oscar nomination caliber. Overdone was Yakushos characters teenage no one understands my pain and Blanchettes characters anger and resentment regarding her husband's past transgressions. In real life these common themes do exist but are much more covert and subtle making these two characters seem more like spoiled brats and compelling this viewer to be unsympathetic.  Underdone was any sort of compassion and concern some of the couples fellow tourist may have had, which could have added a much richer dimension to the ensuing conflict.  The theme of adolescent sexuality was provoking in a seat squirming sort of way which will surely ruffle many a conservative feather as it is unapologetically straight forward.  As is the topic of racism reminiscent of \\"Crash,\\" another film that produced a large outcry at the director for his racism in an attempt to avoid the harsh spotlight of prejudice being shined on us all.  This is also the sort of film that a thousand people could see and write a thousand very different interpretations as it does not preach but simply puts on display intense life and death emotional experiences that has the potential to either destroy or strengthen our resolve to be grateful for what we have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of this TV series before.  Once I saw the movie Serenity, someone told me it was based off of a series on Fox.  I had to check it out and imediatly loved it.  I think this was an awsome series and am very sad to hear it was cancelled.  I's too bad since after watching, it definetly makes you want more.  This is well worth the money.  Just be prepared to be upset when it ends, since there is no more.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|This is one of those movies that you know the minute that you see it, that it is an instant classic.  That everyone you know will watch it.  That it will receive a million awards.  And deservedly so.  Every actor in this film did a great job.  Well written.  Well directed.  Film excellence.
B00005JPG1|5.0|In the late 1960's, the Zodiac killer terrorized Northern California.  Investigating the murders were detectives Dave Roschi (Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Edwards).  Reporting on the murders in the press were Paul Avery (Downey) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal).  In fact, the movie is based on Graysmith's book and the obsession he developd in trying to find the Zodiac's identity.  As such, the \\"solution\\" provided has not been proven, but is the belief of Graysmith.<br /><br />\\"Zodiac\\" is an interesting and well made movie.  Fincher's direction is not a showy as his previous efforts, but keeps the tension high when necessary and interjects small moments of humor to lighten the mood when necessary.  Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, Downey, and Edwards are all very good in their roles, and Lynch is suitably creepy for most of his screen time.  \\"Zodiac\\" may move too slowly for some in its last half, but those that want a peek into the hunt for a serial killer will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend \\"Zodiac\\".
B000M341QE|5.0|This is a highly regarded film that has an almost agonizingly tight story line, even at two and a half hours.  The thing just never lets up.  Every one of the main characters is dancing on a knife's edge wearing roller skates.  It seems like every role in this movie is played by a star even though some are not household names.  The quality of the acting is superb.  I suppose that it helps being given such well written characters.  Since the movie won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay as well as nominated for Best Supporting Actor, well, it doesn't need my little bit of praise.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Casino\\", you will know what to expect here.  While there is plenty of blood, it isn't quite as gruesome as the other two.  No heads in vices or ice picks to the back of the head.  Plenty of punching, kicking, shooting, but the greater monstrosities are implied.  This is more about the emotional strain on all the characters.  Some seem to need the adrenalin rush of the danger while it tears the lives of others to pieces.<br /><br />Still, being a Scorsese film, the dialogue is filled to about half full with F-words.  I know that the movies would have us believe that is how people really talk.  Maybe some do, but not everyone.  I guess Martin Sheen's Captain Queenan didn't, but it is hard to tell because there is so much of it.  It becomes numbing in its ugliness after awhile.  Especially if you and your friends don't use that kind of language in everyday life.<br /><br />It is hard to single out one role for praise, because they really are all played superbly.  However, Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello is indelible.  Nicholson knows how to play it straight while going right up to going over the top, but not going over.  Still, Costello is a great monster.<br /><br />So, if you like this sort of thing, this is a great work.  If you don't, you had best avoid it.
B00005JPCF|3.0|Something about singing and dancing captivates young children. Happy Feet is full of singing and dancing...at least half of the movie are happy songs and tapping (happy) feet. So my kids, especially my 3 year old, are happily captivated.<br /><br />Happy Feet is another in the 13, count 'em, 13 CGI movies of 2006. It's a feel-good movie with the ever popular, ever familiar theme of \\"Judge One Not By His Differences To You And Your Social Circle\\". It's a nice family film with the all-important adult-asides. But nothing too grown up that kids would pick up on.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer-generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />There are lots of popular actors lending their voices to Happy Feet, and there are lots of popular songs that everyone can sing along to. Happy Feet is a good movie that you throw in the DVD player and snuggle up with the kids to watch, and your younger kids will want to watch it over and over and over....That's enough added value and incentive right there to add it to your cart.<br /><br />But, in my humble opinion, Happy Feet isn't one of the top 3 of the 13 2006 CGI movies. Maybe it's the overkill of computer animation in 2006 that just didn't get me as excited for Happy Feet by the time it was released at the end of the year as I was for some of the others released earlier in the year.<br /><br />I think the top 3 CGIs of 2006 were, in order: Ice Age 2, The Ant Bully and Cars. But who cares what I think? It's all about the kids, and the kids loved Happy Feet.<br /><br />And in case you were wondering...the 13 CGI movies of 2006 were: Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, The Ant Bully, Hoodwinked, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away.<br /><br />Choose your own top 3.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I thought the movie was very entertaining as well as my 7 year old daughter. The old tunes made new again made it enjoyable to me, and as far as my daughter is concerned these were all new songs to her. The message part I felt wasn't as deep as it appears to have others thinking. My daughter got out of it a simple we need to care for the environment because what we do doesn't just effect us. Thats all she understood, which is good. As an adult, to me expressing the already obvious in manner in which children can understand. I took it for being positive and fun at the same time. Political? No.  <br /> <br />
0143036556|5.0|I am a big fan of Jared Diamond.  In the first part of this book, he examines cultures that died out, and the factors that led to them dying out.  He also examines cultures that succeeded.  In the second part of this book, he ties it all together into an economist theory of managing the environment.  His view is that of a realist, taking into account both preservation, and the need to use environmental resources.  What you end up with is a strong argument for sustainable use of our natural resources.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Bringing iconoclastic Sebro-Croatian scientist Nikola Tesla into the mix was probably the smartest move the filmmakers chose, and the \\"Don't Look Now\\"-ish conclusive montage will confuse as many as it pleases,and almost seems contrived, too much, to feel real to anyone but a puzzle-picture lover like myself.  <br /> <br />Jackman is convincing, and Chris Bale can't seem to offer a lousy performance in anything - a truly interesting guy to watch in any genre. Nolan remains a captivating filmmaker to watch, but it's hard to outdo \\"Memento\\". That film raised enough questions for a dozen more films.
0393317552|5.0|There are only a few books that I have read that have changed my perspective of the world.  This is one of them.  Absolutely great book.  If you ever wondered how the world ended up the way it is, this book will answer that question.
B00005JPAM|5.0|I went to this movie on a date expecting it to put me to sleep.  Boy was I ever wrong!  This movie could have easily won best picture too.  It was so well made and Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth was not overstated.  She definitely deserved the award she won.  The movie focuses on the death of Princess Diana and how the Royal family behaved during the period immediately after. <br /> <br />The movie portrayed Elizabeth as someone who stuck to tradition (heavily influenced by her mother) and had faith that by sticking to tradition, the public at large would come around and see that she was right.  Unfortunately those traditions were for a time past and no longer held in the Tabloid influenced world of today where celebrities are put under the microscope and all their actions are highly scrutinized.   <br /> <br />Besides Mirren, there were solid performances all around especially by the actor who played Tony Blair.  The director seemed to show that the two smartest people were Blair's and the Queen's personal assistants.  Each one seemed to give the soundest advice of all and both were highly in tune with the public at large. <br /> <br />Even though I basically knew the story going in, I was mesmerized by the way this film was presented.  It should not be missed.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Ordinarly, I don't care for George Cloony because he trys to be a liberal activist in real life.  But in this movie he is terrifically funny as well as his two side-kicks.  Highly recommended for laughs.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|With direction similar to Crash, this movie focused on the plight of three different sets of kids. Two young kids are staying with their Mexican housekeeper while their parents are traveling in Morocco.  Their mother gets shot which prevents the parents from returning.  The housekeeper meanwhile needs to attend her son's wedding across the boarder in Mexico.  With nobody else to care for the kids and not wanting to miss the wedding, she takes the kids with her and her \\"shady\\" nephew to Mexico for the wedding.  Of course something will go wrong in their trip, brought about by the nephew. <br /> <br />The second set of kids are two young boys in Morocco who play with a high powered rifle and accidentally shoot the first kids' mother and then try to cover up what they did before they are caught.   The shot mother is tottering between life and death because she was shot very far from the nearest hospital and her shooting is thought to be terrorist related, causing a whole international incident that prevents the US embassy from sending help to her. <br /> <br />The third kid is a deaf/mute teenager in Tokyo whose father was the owner of the rifle used in the Morocco shooting.  She is very troubled, apparently related to the recent death of her mother (the police had questioned her about her father's possible involvement in the death) and hangs out with a bad crowd who are into drugs.  Also, she appears very promiscuous because she exposes herself to two of the boys and later to a police detective. <br /> <br />The director jumps back and forth from story to story, always at key parts that leave you eager to find out what was going to happen next.   It is a very successful formula here and one can understand all the positive critical reviews that this movie has received.  I felt it actually better than Crash which was last year's best picture.  This year seemed to have so many good movies (The Queen, The Departed) that this movie was up against too much competition to win more awards.  It is excellent nonetheless and should not be missed! <br />
0385040253|5.0|The book is a veritable treasure trove of marlinspike inginuity.  I have looked near and far for this book with no luck other than tatered used copies that were overpriced.  This book was new, hard cover, at a remarkably low cover price.  It has exceeded all my expectations!.....Buy it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an awesome Scifi series! Like a cross between the old west and Starwars! That aspect of the show actually took a couple of episeodes for me to get used to, but once it grew on me a bit I was hooked! After watching episodes I'd catch myself humming the theme song! This is truly an entertaining show. The characters are so well thought out and the actors do such a wonderful job of portraying them...it is too bad the show wasn't on longer because I really love it. The set comes in a nice box/sleeve with nice artistic scenes from the show. Each disc jacket has one of the characters pictured on it. If you like the series don't forget to check out the movie \\"Serenity\\". It is like the final chapter of the story and helps bring closure to the series. And you get to see what River can really do (Awesome!)!
0761129235|5.0|This is a golden little book. Dr. Maurer has taken a business model for productivity and employee morale and applied it to psychology. He describes very simply how we can overcome fear, and accomplish our goals through small steps. I have often wondered why I haven't accomplished many of my big dreams. I have always described this lack of success as \\"shooting myself in the foot.\\" I am perplexed as to why this happens. Dr. Maurer explains that it is fear in the brain (based on brain research at UCLA). He explains we can bypass the brain's reaction by taking smaller steps in accomplishing our goals, tiny ones. For example, I keep looking at my garden. It needs weeding, but I am very busy. I always do it all at once, so a month has passed. Now I am doing it, 6' at a time, could be a foot at a time. I stop when that section is done. It will be done in a week or so. It is our grandiose thinking that triggers fear, so he is teaching us to focus on a small part of the project, or goal. This all sounds simple, but it is truly a powerful message. Whether you can't get yourself to exercise, or you are shy socially, you can break your goal down into the simplest and smallest step and,in time, you will have success. I have recommended this book to everyone I meet, friends and strangers. They have all called to thank me for it. The fact that Dr. Maurer's ideas are based on a successful business model, and brain research, means that it appeals to a wider audience, not just the \\"self help\\" crowd. All therapists should read this (I was one once). It will save you and your clients time and heartache. Of course, we have to envy Dr. Maurer's clients. You can just feel if you had him in your life, you could do anything. By reading and paying attention to his words, I believe his wise little book will serve you and friends very well.
0743496728|5.0|I have read most of Jodi Picoult's novels and they just seem to get better and better each time. Basically, \\"19 minutes\\" is loosely based on the tragedy that occured at Columbine High School in 1999; however, there is one major difference. The alleged shooter, who killed 10 people, injured 19 and damaged the psychological well-being of countless others, remained alive and was put on trial for his crime. Many people would be fascintated by this novel, for an infinite amount of reasons, including (but not limited to) an interest in the the tragedy that occured at Columbine in 1999, those who enjoy an in-depth psychological study of such an incident, anyone who enjoys a good legal drama, people who were either bullied or the object of bullying in high school and parents of those who are bullied or the bullies themselves. There are endless twists and turns in \\"19 minutes,\\" which kept me glued to the book until its final page.
0743289412|4.0|I will admit right up front that in recent years I've reluctantly joined the club whose motto seems to be \\"Stephen King used to be a really interesting writer...\\"  So it's with trepidation that I picked up this book; a person can be diappointed only so many times.<br /><br />I wasn't sure where I stood with the story for the first 60 or 70 pages.  It starts slow, it's convoluted right from the beginning and there's a whole sub-set of vocabulary thrown at the reader that does, at times, seem a bit contrived.<br /><br />But then the novel shifted into third gear and I was sucked into the story from then on.  I found it suspensful, wildly creative and keenly incisive, as King can be when he works at it.  Here is a widow we think we know, about whom there are many secrets yet to learn.  Here is a man, already dead as the tale begins, whom his wife thought she knew.  But behind the charm, smile and wit lay dark secrets, a brittle memory and a fragile soul.  The same thing that drives us to creativity can also drive us mad.  The world King creates in Boo'ya Moon was fascinating to me, as dark, lush, exotic and mysterious as I would think such a world must be.  It's the beasts of the past come to life and the possibility of dreams made real.<br /><br />This is, at its core, a love story and a tale of how love, devotion and sometimes blind courage can help keep a person sane.  It's the first book I've enjoyed by King in some time.  Original, creative and heartfelt.
B000M4RG42|4.0|The bloody battle of Iwo Jima is the catalyst for the drama in Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers,\\"  but this is not a \\"war\\" movie in the usual sense. Although there are many effectively staged battle scenes, the focus is more on the aftermath of the war for three soldiers (Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford , and Adam Beach), only two of whom were even present in the historic photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jima, who are cast as the \\"Heroes\\" by a government desperate to sell war bonds to fund victory in World War II.<br /><br />Though many critics compared \\"Flags\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" perhaps because the latter's director, Steven Spielberg, was a co-producer, Eastwood's film is closer in spirit to \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\" and even \\"Coming Home.\\" It examines society's need for heroes and the dehumanizing effect such status can have on those singled out for the honor. These men are perfectly aware that they are basking in glory that may more rightfully belong to those who did not survive, who were, as one of them reminds a cheering crowd, killed on the island of Iwo Jima.<br /><br />\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" has an epic sweep, but it is essentially a character study, not only of the men who fought the battle, but of a society so willing to exploit them.<br /><br />The performances are all noteworthy, but it is Adam Beach as the tragic Ira Hayes who offers the standout performance. Had \\"Flags\\" not been a box-office disappointment, Beach would likely have been deservedly Oscar nominated as best supporting actor.<br /><br />The film is not without its flaws. The multiple flashbacks can sometimes make things confusing, and the music score, by Eastwood himself, is too muted for its own good. A more stirring score might have enhanced the emotional effect of the story. Still, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is easily one of the best films of 2006 and one of the finest films to ever deal with World War II.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks

B0002TX4QQ|5.0|I found this book by accident, and really didn't know what to expect.  This book is truly terrifying in an all too real way.  This book is every parent's nightmare and I'm sure it's more common than we can even imagine.  But, it will make you think every time you drop your kid off at school who exactly his or her classmates are.  I couldn't put it down.
074356619X|5.0|Hi, I have been studying the Law of Attraction for years.  The Secret is beautifully done, with lots of examples of ways to attract any thing you have ever wanted into your life. It is truly amazing.  My life is soaring and abundance flows into my life, in all forms, continuously and quickly.  My dreams are realized and The Secret encourages me to keep on dreaming and believing that I am living my dreams. Purchase these CDs.  You are worth it and you deserve to live your dreams.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I consider myself as too well-read and scientifically inclined, so I thought that this movie will be boring and will repeat some trivial stuff. I was mistaken! Al Gore shines through amazing technical stuff and statistics to deliver a compelling case for tackling Global Warming now. It certainly encouraged our family to be even more green than what we were, and we are planning to buy a hybrid as well.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Alias is fantastic !!!      I started to watch the Alias television (TV) spy series soon after the finale aired in mid-2006. I was instantly hooked and love the show. The well developed characters, action and hidden agendas keep Alias interesting from start to finish. Alias reminds me of the old 1960s/ 1970s Mission Impossible TV spy series but with a lot more character development and continuity between the episodes.      I am not the type who usually buys DVDs, much less of an entire series but I fully recommend the entire Alias series, especially in the Rambaldi collection. The Rambaldi collection not only contains the entire series but also includes a small book with writers' comments in addition to a bonus DVD which has stuff like actor interviews and behind the scenes. I would hold off on viewing the book and DVD until seeing the entire series so you can be sure not to spoil anything.      What would I change about the series? Not much and certainly nothing major. It took me a little over 3 months to watch the series the first time and I look forward to seeing it again but at a more leisurely pace :) Enjoy !!!
074356619X|4.0|This is an outstanding program.  Not new, but newly presented and packaged in a way that reaches more people, more effectively <br /> <br />I'm a firm advocate for The Law of Attraction, and this audio program is just great. <br /> <br />If you are still 'thinking' about whether to buy it or not. <br /> <br />STOP thinking and get into action. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />I only gave it 4 stars because I'm sure that there is more and better to come!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Amazing album! The 28 tracks represent a consolidation, not duplication, of their previous works. Kiedis displays his incredible versatility throughout with his styles of rap rock to melodic mid-tempo ballads. Flea's style is more matured and mellow on many tracks. Popular hits Dani California and Snow, as well as the title track, Stadium Arcadium, cover the gamut of Peppers' style over the past 20 odd years. My thought: Stadium Arcadium is as close to perfection as you can get with modern rock!
074356619X|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this item.  It provides more info than the DVD.  This information has been tremendously helpful and enjoyable to listen to.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This is really a great movie. Jack N. is great. I have never been a Leonardo C. fan but he does a really good job.  You definitley need this in your DVD collection.  The bluray is really good.  I play it on my PS3.  Its one of those things once you go Bluray you never can go back.  Its like going from 56k modem to DSL.  Anyway the movie is really fantastic.
0618164413|5.0|These are all the original works of the Reys, not like some of the other books out there which were done by other authors.
B00065MDSQ|4.0|I have read the interviews from Fripp as well... at the time 'Red' was released, Prog rock should have ended.  I would have to take the side of Fripp on this statement and disagree with not only other reviewers on here but also disagree with various musical friends who believe that Prog rock should see a \\"revival\\" or that it has \\"never died.\\"  The prog rock genre was really only an experimental genre.  The record companies were giving a go back in the '70's with marketing this sort of music only because there was an overseas fanbase.  The genre basically imploded on itself because there was too much money spent on recording, instrumentation, and the technicalities that were needed to produce an elaborate and large stage show.  Back then, that took $$$ to pull off such monstrosities (however you spell it). Fripp stated later in the '70's that punk and disco were a breath of fresh air and that they were musics that put the nail in the coffin to Prog rock.  Right on Bob!  Musical politics aside, The album Red did define what King Crimson were meant to be!  A rock band!  This is straight ahead rock with the typical eccentric Frippian twists (odd meters, time changes, progressive scaling and orchestration) that had been heard on previous Krimson albums but were made to annoy more than move the listener.  I could go into a breakdown of each song on this album, but I won't.  I will say that if you're a fan of Fripp and King Crimson and don't own this album, you are missing out.  In fact if you do not own ANY OTHER Krimson album, you should own this one.  This is the epitome of what King Crimson was before and after.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|This is truly one of the best concerts I have ever seen. Madonna is definitely at the best she can be! The music is great and the dancers are totally amazing! I highly recommend this DVD to any Madonna lover.
0895260131|1.0|THE BOOK IS FULL OF LIES. IT IS NOT WORTHY TO SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME AT ALL.
1582701709|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing it on Oprah, as I'm sure many of you did. When I started reading the book I realized that it teaches the same thing many other Spiritual Leaders have been trying to teach me for YEARS... it's simply worded differently. Amazing! I've purchased this book as a gift to many of my friends and family and have also purchased it on Audio CD for my Mom and myself. Saturation of the mind with positive words. This material is life changing if you apply it. Many of my friends and family are already starting to see the changes and they're not even done with the book yet. I highly recommend this book!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. We've had this movie for about 3 years and still periodically watch it. this is a bit unique... to find a movie that lasts that long. <br /> <br />I would recommend this for young children. This is one of the BEST movies we own. The only 2 I'd rate above this would eb Shrek & Shrek II. The story line is easy for my son to follow and provided him with many hours of entertainment. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent. The movie is mostly an original concept and was written to as to entertain adults too...for the first couple of viewings anyway.... <br />
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Bought this CD for my daughter (her request - birthday gift)... she absolutely loves it.  Nice to see an 18 year old appreciate other types of music - she really enjoys the sound of it.
B00005JL96|4.0|Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a couple of weeks it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have. <br /> <br />I would recommend this for young children.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I did not get started on the series until recently. I started watching the reruns on ABCFamily. I fell in love with the show and decided to start ordering the series. I'm the kind of person who likes to start a series from the beginning to see how it progresses. I am glad I did. I think they did a wonderful job of casting. All of the characters seem to work well with each other. It is great to watch the trust distrust relationship with Lex and Clark. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes the Superman story. I will warn you, be ready to spend a lot of time in front of the television, because like a good book, you won't be able to stop watching.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a year or so it had fallen to the back of his preference list.

It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent or inappropriate.

0679809015|5.0|Well, I managed to purchase an item that was 24.99 from amazon.. one freaking penny more and it's free shipping... Well, I've made a bit of an effort to help expand my son's choices of books to read before bead-time so I chose this book to meet my $25 minimum. <br /> <br />He loves the interaction and has chosen it 4 of the past 5 nights for his bed-time book. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before he moves on to a new book, but for right now... it seems to be the book of the moment.  <br /> <br />The book would be good for a child in the pre-reading age and may not be good for a child who lacks soem finer motor skills. The content is nice and allows he and I to interact and prompts questions about various farm animals. it's amazing how... when you try... almost any book can promote educational benefits... even one about farm animals. <br />I'd definitely buy this book again. <br />

B000KCHZK6|2.0|Shame on you Nora.  I love her voice, have totally enjoyed her previous albums and this one comes as a very big disappointment.  Having a poilitical opinion is great and is admirable because it indicates an awareness and concern for a person's country. Perhaps those views would best be shared in a different venue rather than imposing them upon people who purchase music for the sake of enjoyment.   <br /> <br />The songs became monotonous due to there sameness in tone, tempo, and to add to this, the words were difficult to decipher.  Good thing lyrics were included. <br /> <br />I am a Nora Jones fan and will continue to listen to everything she produces with the hope that soon she will reclaim her unique style that endeared her initially.

6305181810|5.0|and this is one of my favorites. Matt Damon does an excellent job. Devito couldn't have done a better job. I love it when he plays a serious/funny situation. He made this movie ease up when the tension got high. If you are looking for a movie that gives justice in the end, this one is for you.

B00005JPCD|4.0|Cute movie. It starts off kinda slow at the beginning, but gains speed and becomes pretty entertaining. I dont understand why when movies attempt to show what humans do to other people/animals, people get outraged and hate the movie. Its all true, and thats why Happy Feet is a good movie. <br /> <br />So movie is about this penguin (Mumble) who is born \\"different\\". Instead of singing, he can dance. He is somewhat of an outcast and when he ventures too far, he meets a different kind of penguin species that dont mind his \\"happy feet\\". While out having fun, he finds that the food supply is being taken away by someone. He goes on a quest to try and find out why the fish are being removed from the ocean. <br /> <br />Cute elements/plots. First of all, the plot about accepting someone eventhough they are different is great. Its been done before by practically most movies, but this one does it cute. Also, the fact that he gets captured and held in captivity while the humans are looking at him through a glass is true. An animal away from its natural habitat who feels isolated is portrayed nicely. And the fact that it ends in a happy ending makes a good ending. <br /> <br />Nice job of the animations. Entertaining singing, some humor and good lessons.  <br /> <br />Its a little different from the other animated movies but i still recommend it.
6305212112|5.0|I go from crying to laughing to hooraying all through the movie. It is a sweet movie with lots of drama. It is a great chick flick. One girls journey through life.
B000002B5L|5.0|when i was 8 years old i got this album. <br />10 years later it's still tight, i listen to it everytime i want to <br />and i feel this is very good. this album is not just a season hit, <br />it's a classic, the kind you'd listen to in 20 , 40 years and think - <br />it's awesome.
B00005LOLD|3.0|Unfortunately, this movie will give future generations absolutely no clue as to why Marlon Brando was considered one of the finest actors of his day.  Every one of his tics and affectations are on display; the shambling slouch, the beetle browed grimace, the inexplicable adoption of a disfiguring and ludicrous accent (southern this time).  All of which rendered him totally unbelievable as a spit and polish West Point graduate.  What was he thinking?  Why did the director let him get away with it?<br /><br />Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki carry the acting honors in this one, and James Garner too, who made me wish he had been given the leading role instead.<br /><br />What I appreciate most about this moive, however, was the way it endeavored to introduce Western audiences to the different forms of Japanese theatre.  For that, I will even forgive it the rather alarming sight of Ricardo Montelban as a Japanese Kabuki actor.  By the way, the all girl revue in the picture is based on the very famous and still extant Takarazuka All-Girl Revue.
B000GY729M|2.0|..it would probably sound like this: the unholy and unlikely marriage of Robert Smith and Bruce Springsteen. I don't think I've ever heard a more misguided effort by a band whose heart is clearly in the right place. While 2004's Hot Fuss was a derivative affair, putting Psychedelic Furs, Smiths and Cure into a blender, this record is dominated by one artist and one artist only...THE BOSS! That's not unique really. John Mellencamp has managed to emulate Springsteen for 30 some years but The Killers are definitely the wrong band to score \\"Eddie And The Cruisers\\". The lyrics are pulled right out of Born To Run 101 with hurricanes on fire and couples needing to get out of this two horse town and so on. While Brandon Flowers has mastered Springsteen's delivery right down to the vocal quivering he strangely tries to keep one foot in New Wave-ville by channeling Robert Smith. It's an odd sound and one that Flowers himself may regret since I've noticed that he's re-recorded some parts for the singles \\"Bones\\" and \\"Read My Mind\\".  By the way the first single \\"When You Were Young\\" is the one track that actually works in the context of Bruce-meets-Ultravox. \\"Read My Mind\\" is a close second and \\"For Reasons Unknown\\" is \\"Mr. Brightside\\" part two (go ahead...sing \\"Mr. Brightside\\" to yourself over the chorus...I dare ya). There are two wraparound tracks that would give the impression that this is a concept album but the only concept here is Brandon Flowers walked into a record store and bought Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits and was blown away (a true story).  Look I like these guys and they helped to give rock a shot in the arm back in 2004 so I WANT them to succeed but they really need to find a direction that works for them. I can understand that they did'nt want to make Hot Fuss: The Next Generation and I've read all the reviews here...\\"Can't you see? They're changing their sound? They're progressing! Don't expect Hot Fuss again!\\"....Guys...IMITATING BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IS NOTPROGRESSING..you've gotta be kidding me? I can only assume that you don't already own any Bruce albums..well, if you love Sam's Town you're going to REALLY love Born To Run.  It's one thing to be influenced by someone and certainly Hot Fuss showed the band building upon it's 80's inspiration but Sam's Town perhaps goes a little too far in it's hero worship and the band sound unsure and unsteady about who they are.  In short, a few good tracks, one oustanding one and maybe more for the Bryan Adams crowd than the Morrissey fans. They'll learn from it and bounce back. I got faith in 'em.

Sometimes \\"bad things happen to good people,\\" as Harold Kushner's book so eloquently puts it. I also think it was very irresponsible for Oprah Winfrey to give this book so much airtime and support.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Even before Scorsese finally received his first Best Director Oscar for The Departed on 25 February 2007, this two-disc special edition DVD was released.  It includes a \\"Scorsese on Scorsese\\" doc (compiled in 2005 by Time critic and Scorsese friend Richard Schickel) in which Scorsese comments on his major films since Who's That Knocking On My Door (1967) up to The Aviator (2004).  Note the excerpts from Italianamerican (1974), which is one of the few Scorsese films not yet released on DVD, as well as the hilarious American Express advertisement where Scorsese collects his pictures at a photo development shop!  Scorsese on Scorsese updates the AFI Directors DVD about Scorsese (that covered Scorsese's work up to Bringing Out The Dead (1999)) and, along with the belated Oscar, the extensive DVD treatment of all Scorsese's major films confirm his place in the American film establishment.      Another doc provides a good cultural-historical review of gangsters and life in South Boston.  Much of Scorsese's masterworks (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, The Aviator) are based on historical people and events, and the special editions of these five films all include information or docs on the people and events \\"behind\\" the films.     Thirty years ago, Scorsese received the Cannes Film Festival Palm d'Or and his first Best Picture Oscar nomination for Taxi Driver (1976).  However, he had to wait until Raging Bull (1980) before the Academy nominated him as Best Director for the first time.  At the March 1977 Academy Awards, Taxi Driver received four nominations, including Best Picture.  But Scorsese's film did not receive a single Oscar award and the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing awards were all rewarded to Rocky (1976), with Sylvester Stallone also receiving Oscar nominations for both Best Actor (along with Taxi Driver star Robert De Niro) and Best Original Screenplay (no nomination in this category for film critic and Taxi Driver writerPaul Schrader).    Thirty years later, Stallone received generally positive critical comment and decent commercial returns for the sixth instalment of his Rocky franchise, Rocky Balboa (2006), a tribute to the original Oscar-winning classic.  But this time (as with the previous four sequels) there were no Oscar nominations and none of the spectacular commercial success of the original Rocky, whereas The Departed did not only win four Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay and Film Editing (Scorsese veteran Telma Schoonmaker's third Film Editing award) but was also Scorsese's most commercially successful film to date.    Film veteran Clint Eastwood, another friend of Richard Schickel, was nominated for the third time in his career for both Best Picture and Best Director for Letters from Iwo Jima (2007).  Two years ago, Eastwood won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars for Million Dollar Baby (2004, Eastwood's second win of these two Oscars, following his final Western Unforgiven (1992)), when Scorsese had his fifth unsuccessful nomination for The Aviator.  This time, Eastwood had the rare experience of Oscar disappointment and Scorsese the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of Oscar success.    But Eastwood could be consoled by the fact that, unlike Stallone, this aging, inarticulate action-franchise hero finally managed to receive massive critical acclaim (and the same legendary status as Scorsese), having moved on from 1970s and 1980s five-film franchise anti-hero Dirty Harry to original, interesting films that question his earlier screen persona stereotypes (in the case of Million Dollar Baby and Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Eastwood also provided a more complex, nuanced side to the 30-odd year underdog boxing champion and the American war hero).  At the March 1977 Academy Awards, dominated by Stallone's Rocky, Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Whales (1976, now considered by one film critic as Eastwood's best film to date) received some insignificant nominations and (like Scorsese's Taxi Driver) no awards.  Thirty years later, Eastwood and Scorsese are dominating the Oscar ceremony for the second time in two years, while actor-writer-director Stallone receives no Academy recognition for his originally Oscar-winning six-film franchise action hero Rocky Balboa.
B000NA28IE|1.0|Even if I was ten years old and was part of the targeted audience I'd still think this was a horrible movie (and i don't like any of the Harry Potter Movies/Books either).  The plot, dialogue and over all theme of even the books had little to no depth at all.  The first two books read very straight forward with little to no thinking involved and all imagination.  Which is somthing I enjoy in a book everyonce in a while but I haven't seen an adaptation from book to film this bad since ... correction this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to movie I have ever seen.  I am still baffled by not only seeing this in theatres but also how i had to convince myself to stay because it might get better.  Having seen it I can feel nothing but disappointment for how the third book has been put off for this piece of crap.  Lame Hollywood. Really Lame.  You took an easy story and tried as hard as you could to screw it up.  If that was the over all intention then I'd have to say you succeeded admirably.

B00005JPAO|5.0|*no spoilers*<br /><br />We get very excited when an Oscar contender is found--they are hard to find nowadays. Now that we are just weeks away from 2007, we finally saw a film that has history, humanity, drama and a charismatic touch. \\"The Queen\\" is one of the best films we've reviewed this year. It is such an entertaining film and we are so eager to tell you about it.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />\\"The Queen\\" tells the \\"behind the scenes\\" story of how the British Royal Family and the new Tony Blair's government dealt within the first week of the death of Princess Diana on August 31, 1997. An event that shocked the world in so many levels, but especially for the British Royal Family who struggled to keep things quite. The movie focuses on Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) poor handle of the aftermath and her differences with her new prime minister (Michael Sheen) who wanted her to stop hiding and to face the nation during those difficult times.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />There have been long speculations and conspiracy theories about Princess Diana's death. After 9 years, from time to time, we see TV shows researching the circumstances of her accident and vague conclusions of who is to blame for such a tragedy. \\"The Queen\\" is not about conspiracy theories, but rather about an alternative story of how the British Royal Family--especially Queen Elizabeth II--showed the world how unprepared and indifferent they were to the British People and the world to deal with a national tragedy. The movie shows the true extraordinary love the world felt for Princess Diana which is something that made some of the members of the royalty very concern.<br /><br />The way the story is told (almost day by day after her death) creates a realistic feel to it--almost like we were watching the events in real time similar to the movie \\"United 93.\\" The real footage flashbacks are perfectly in place to help the story develop and create drama. \\"The Queen\\" also shows the British Royal Family as an orthodox old fashion family who didn't want to change their ways despise the press attacking them for that whole week. Wee see a \\"behind the iron curtain\\" view of who they really are; just ordinary people after all-- sometimes their behavior creates funny moments throughout the film.<br /><br />The acting is one of best features of \\"The Queen.\\" Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen did a terrific job impersonating these complex and famous characters--they are very look alike to say the least. There is good chemistry while together on the screen. We see them struggling and fighting their own demons. They wanted to make things right--in their own way--but sometimes they couldn't communicate that to each other. We feel there is an Oscar buzz on any of these characters.<br /><br />Great accomplishments we see in the technical department. The movie is just too darn pretty to look at. We see beautiful British landscapes, great costume design and excellent photography on screen. The editing is also fluid and meticulous.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />A tragic week in the history of The Royal Family and the world, \\"The Queen\\" gives us its take on the week after the death of the People's Princess. The story is told almost moment by moment, tear by tear felt by everyone who knew and loved her. This movie might generate some controversy and criticism for its accuracy, but they cannot take away the fact that the film is intelligent, symbolic, adventurous and not afraid to come with its own conclusions.hodox old fashion family who didn't want to change their ways despise the press attacking them for that whole week.

B00005JPLU|4.0|I find it funny how people sit here and type pages about a movie taken from a comic book or \\"graphic novel\\" and expect it to be a perfect representation of the battle of Thermopylae.  If you're looking for that there was a great show on the history channel for you.  If you want to see cutting edge CGI, some of most bloody battle scenes on the screen to date go and see 300. Although the dialog and plot are shaky at times, and IMO the ending was a little drawn out the movie was a feast for the eyes.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|*No Spoilers*<br /><br />We were surprised--looked at each other and chuckled in disbelief--when we found out about macho superstar Sylvester Stallone making another Rocky movie. Once again, he was going to direct it and write it. Personally--as a boxing fan--I thought it would never work. The film would not be believable not only because of his age, but also because of his fading super star status. We had doubts about his new production. We thought about recent turkeys like Spy Kids 3-D, I See You and Driven--Can he comeback and bring his good old days? Sly cannot be serious, can he? We were so wrong. This is a true Hollywood comeback in every sense of the word. Rocky Balboa is an excellent and uplifting film about one of the greatest American icons of our time.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) lives a peaceful life in his home city of South Philadelphia. He has retired from boxing and now he owns a modest restaurant where he tells old boxing stories to his guests. He always remembers his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) who passed away few years back. He drives around to visit old places where they used to be together along with his companion Paulie (Burt Young) who is not too happy about Rocky living in the past. His son Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia)--who lives on his own--is troubled by the way he's treated by everyone because of his \\"son of the champion\\" status. As Rocky wonders around his old neighborhood, he meets a bartender Marie (Geraldine Hughes) who he builds--perhaps a romantic--friendship.<br /><br />There is a new heavyweight champion in the world of boxing. Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Anthony Tarver) dominates his weigh class with virtually no one left to challenge him. He is proud, but very unlikable character in the world of prizefighting. Sports TV network ESPN runs a show where they use computer generated graphics to recreate dream boxing matches--from boxers of different eras. They recreate a dream fight between Rocky Balboa and Dixon, the computer says that Rocky would win. Dixon does not think too much of it, but Rocky sees an opportunity for redemption. He decides to get his boxing license back despite the opinions of his son and old Pauli--Marie is very supportive. Dixon's managers see an opportunity to make more money and convince the current champion to fight Rocky. They contact Rocky and he accepts. Now it is time for the people's champion to fight one more time. Will he even survive the first round?<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Stallone goes back to the character that made him famous and delivers one of the best films of 2006. He is true to the character--a beloved and wiser--Rocky Balboa who still believes in his heart that it's never too late to step up in the ring. He shows the world that there are no boundaries--not even his age--when it comes to pursuit of happiness. We see him training with enthusiasm, despite the negativism around him. In other words, his performance and the story reach out the audience in a way never before. He inspires and motivates everyone to stand up for themselves. He literally makes the audience stand up and cheer.<br /><br />In the technical department, Rocky Balboa does marvels. The traditional shots of the city of Philadelphia are back, but look better than ever. We are surprised of how beautiful the photography is in this film, giving us the feeling of the old Rocky films. The first half of the film might be talky for some, but it's done to develop the character. The last part of the film is where the fireworks begin.<br /><br />Boxing fans will be pleased by the way the fight scenes are presented. The way they broadcast the main event is so realistic--even real boxing celebrities are involved--that is like watching a PPV boxing event in real time. The aerial shots of Las Vegas, the camera work, the introduction of the fighters, the tale of the tape down to the announcers and the referee gives the audience that illusion. Stallone combines some of the old school Rocky type flashbacks while fighting--the best of both worlds combined.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />We thought this would be a weak one, we take it back now. Stallone brings back the beloved character--and most of his corner--to deliver a \\"feel good\\" film that is not going to disappoint. Rocky Balboa has a compelling story, great acting and visuals that will keep you cheering for more.e old school Rocky type flashbacks while fighting--the best of both worlds combined. <br /> <br />The Verdict: <br />We thought this would be a weak one, we take it back now.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|The Cold War is over, but that doesn't mean that there are not new treats to the world. For that reason, the Bond franchise gets a fresh start. The movie is now based on Ian Fleming's first book Casino Royale. This time Daniel Craig gets the role of one of the coolest characters in cinema, James Bond. He has presence on screen and the action is plenty, but the story could have been better.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />James Bond (Daniel Craig) is the new kid on the block in the MI6 organization led by M (Judi Dench). He gained the 00 status after his two first kills. He is a cold-blooded, reckless and egomaniacal spy. Now as a 00 agent, he is after a villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who funds terrorist groups around the world. One terrorist attack is stopped by Bond. To cripple his evil activities, Bond follows him to Montenegro where they will play an extravagant game of poker. As Bond travels, he meets his undercover partner, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) who gets romantically involved with him. Will he be able to stop Le Chiffre? Will Bond break the spy code and fall for Vesper?<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />We all expect--if you are fan of Bond movies--to see cool gadgets, exotic cars, crazy stunts and plenty of beautiful women and you'll see most of those traditional icons in this new film. This time around the gadgets are almost gone to create a more mature, realistic and darker Bond--a beautiful Aston Martin is his car of choice. He is more reckless, egomaniac and careless that the previous 007 (Pierce Brosnan).<br /><br />We like the first half of the film--the classic Bond intro credits is one of the best ones. The photography is excellent and the stunts are probably one if the best we've seen this year--the airport action scene is priceless. Honestly, Daniel Craig was not my first choice as the next Bond--my pick was Clive Owen--but after watching his performance in this new film, he totally changed my mind. He is perfect for the role. He is very athletic, charismatic, but always keeping his cold-blooded and strong personality.<br /><br />Unfortunately the last half of the film is where most of the problems are. The main story becomes secondary, sillier, paper thin and stretched for a movie that is 144 minutes long. The plot is now more about Bond's ego and his game of poker. The editing could have been better--at this point, the movie drags--especially while playing poker. The game resembles a fancy version of the ESPN World Series of Poker TV show. As we are watching Bond playing poker, we realize how silly the whole scene is. How can you bring down someone that is funding terrorists just by taking his money in a game of poker? We ask ourselves. Also during the games, Bond and Vesper get romantic, but we don't feel the connecting between them. Their relationship feels a bit forced and awkward.<br /><br />After waiting for a great finale, we were surprised that the movie doesn't end in a conventional way because the story seems to \\"continue\\" for the next installment.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />Casino Royale--even though it has some low points--is much better than the previous movie from the Pierce Brosnan era. No more ridiculous gadgets. This reborn of the franchise feels more mature. We hope to see more of Daniel Craig in his new and exciting new role, but we also hope the next plot to be stronger than this one. For the filmmakers, please make the film a bit shorter next time.smatic, but always keeping his cold-blooded and strong personality. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the last half of the film is where most of the problems are.

B000E6EHGI|5.0|Released in 1974, this is the Grateful Dead's eight studio album and 12th album release overall.  The original CD was 44 minutes long but the bonus material gets it up close to 80 minutes.      Like all of the remastered Grateful Dead CD's, the sound quality is excellent.  It is enhanced by with HDCD sound.  I just bought a CD player with a HDCD decoder, and this sounds stunning.  HDCD is a 24 bit recording vs. the normal 16 bit of a regular CD.  It can be played back on a normal CD player, and sounds better than a normal CD.  But, you get the best improvement if you have a CD player that does HDCD.    Like all of the remastered Grateful Dead CD's, this has bonus material to take it up to 80 minutes.  The quality of the bonus material has been hit and miss.  For instance, it is poor on American Beauty.  On Blues For Allah, the bonus material compliments the original music and enhances the whole disc.  If there were any doubts before, with the bonus material, this is definitely a five star disc.  I also like that there is approximately a 10 second gap between the original and bonus material, to seperate the two.    This comes in a nice cardboard case, and unlike most cardboard cases, the plastic tabs that hold the CD are sturdy and do not snap off.  This part of the second boxset of remastered Dead CD's.  Unlike the first set, this CD does not have a booklet and extensive liner notes.  The extensive info on the CD is contained in a book that comes in the boxset, but is not available if you buy the individual CD's.    Blues For Allah is a complex work that really flows together from start to finish.  Although there are seperate and distinct songs, it all plays like one long suite.  The bonus material is mostly instrumentals that follows the same music flow.  This along with Terrapin Station are the Dead's foray into a quasi progress rock style.  But, at the same time, it has that mellow but bright sounding atmosphere, similar to Wake of the Flood.      After this album was recorded, the band went to the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco and played a live show that included all the songs from this album.  It is captured on the double CD, One From the Vault.  Unlike what another has said, I don't think that live version is as good as this tight and wonderfully recorded studio version.  Also, I have heard other live versions of Blues For Allah that are really spacy and go on for an hour.  I would like to an official CD release of one of those shows.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|*No spoilers*<br /><br />Inspirational movies touch your heart. They have something that tells about ourselves and things we can relate to. \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is the most inspirational film of 2006. Not only because we understand and care about the main characters, but also there is an important message which is to follow your dreams no matter what. The road might be difficult--maybe to the point of despair--but if you finish the journey, your life will change forever.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />The movie starts in San Francisco in early 1980s. Family man Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is going through difficult financial problems. He is an unsuccessful salesman who struggles everyday trying to sell a medical machine--bigger than a microwave oven--that not many doctors want. He carries one everyday. Unfortunately, his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) doesn't make much money either. They have a five-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith) who Chris takes to a day care center everyday. Things go from bad to worse; the money they make is not enough to sustain them. Chris sees an opportunity, he wants to become a stock broker and gets an internship, but there is no pay until he is chosen. Linda cannot stand the poverty they live in and decides to leave him for good. Chris wants to stay with his son in San Francisco, she doesn't fight back. Now he has to take care of him and pursuit a dream to become a stock broker and leave the poverty they are in. \\"Will\\" he make it?<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />A compelling film, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" follows the old dramatic underdog formula that most of us are used to by now, but it's done correctly this time around because you really care about the main character. In other words, Will's performance is what makes this movie great. We see Chris going through a lot of problems, not only economically but emotionally as well. Linda is sick and tired of dealing with all his issues--she is a mean and unlikable character to say the least--and poor little Christopher is always asking questions. These situations create moments of despair to Chris throughout the film. Although it seems for moments that the whole city is against him, Will Smith's character never gives up his hopes. He is smart, likable and persuasive--he is also excellent at the 80s famous Rubik's cube which gives the audience a feeling of how smart this guy is. He sends the right message to the audience of what he is about.<br /><br />We appreciate the credibility and realism of this film due to great photography and costume design--the look and feel of the subway scenes are excellent. These elements give us the impression that we are back in the 80s. There are some moments where the movie drags a bit and it might feel soapy for some, but those small little flaws do not affect the final product.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />Probably an Oscar contender for best actor, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a touchy film that gives us lessons of perseverance, love and the American dream. Great acting, inspiring story, and the survival factor make the film one of the best dramas of 2006. We recommend it.or little Christopher is always asking questions.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|This movie is essentially what Superman II was supposed to be and is a must watch.  It really is a completely different movie that is much more interesting and fun to watch than the Richard Lester version.  There's a lot more father-son interaction with Superman and Jor'El, his father.  It is also as funny as the first with Lex Luther and Miss Teschmacher.  It has a better more \\"Superman-like\\" ending, although this ending ruins the connection between this Superman II and the new Superman Returns. <br /> <br />Special care has been made with the \\"new\\" special effects to actually look like the period's effects capability of the time.  The other words, the movie looks like it was made in 1980, even with the CGI scenes.  Very well done, though. <br /> <br />Warner Bros has certainly corrected a mistake of long ago and listened to their Superman fans by funding and releasing this version of the movie.  Thank them by buying this movie.
B000A6T262|4.0|At last, all ten Star Trek Special Editions in one nifty package.  Each movie is comprised of two DVDs -- the feature on one, plus lots of extras on the other.  Each film includes deleted scenes woven right into the feature, so if you are very familiar with the original version you will definitely notice a few changes by way of extension.  Most of these are very cool and help flesh out the story and characters.  Occasionally they are a little distracting insofar as you can tell why the scene was deleted in the first place.  In the case of Insurrection, most of the deleted scenes are great with the overall effect of almost creating a different (and better) movie altogether, which makes you wonder what was going on with the editing process for the theatrical release.<br /><br />My only quibble is that the master they used to transfer Star Trek II was not very clean, so you can see occasional film defects (streaks and spots), just like sitting in the theater over 20 years ago.  Not quite the upgraded and polished trip down nostalgia lane I was hoping for...but you may not even notice these if watching on non-HD TV.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I first noticed Jamiroquai when MTV was playing the Virtual Instanity video from Traveling Without Moving.  I was first blown away by the video itself because I am not the type of person who can watch a video repeatedly unless it is extremely unique. I was secondly surprised because a lot of white singers don't sing like that in America.  Jay Kay has one of the most unique and soulful vocals I have ever heard.  I was finally blown away by the band itself. After doing some research, I purchased Traveling Without Moving and every album before it.  I also purchased every future album.  It was interesting listening to how they changed over the years. I still don't understand why America has not embraced this band on a larger scale. This band has given me another outlet of music to listen to outside of Rap, R&B, and Neo-soul.  Thank you for a breath of fresh air.

0618680004|1.0|This book is rubbish. I like Dawkins, I really do. He writes cool books about genetics and generally helps me understand how things work. But this book is badly argued, ill-conceived claptrap. Basically, Dawkins argues that all religous belief is a load of utter rubbish which needs to be put under the clear and bright spotlight of modern science. However, Dawkins fatally fails to acknowledge that the spotlight of modern science is anything but clear and bright. At most it's a murky, ugly, pimple-faced mess. Dawkins wants to replace religion with science. I wish him the best of luck.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|This is a good selection and a good mix, but there are a couple of little things that are quite annoying. <br />1) Why do we have to hear a British police siren before 'I Am the Walrus'?  <br />2) Why oh why oh WHY do we have those idiot Liverpool voices at the end? These voices are NOT the Beatles, NOR are they genuine Liverpool accents.  <br />To the educated ear these effects are like finger nails on a blackboard, and totally unnecessary. <br />Overall though an interested new mix of classic Beatles and worth having.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Movie: This is Scorsese's Pop-Americana crime thriller and it's unparalleled entertainment. The film has it all: line after line after quotable line. Engrossing twists and turns. Compelling characterizations. And poppy bloody violence. <br /> <br />DVD: Great in-depth docs. Pristine video and sound. But the lack of Scorsese Commentary is devastating considering how entertaining the man is when speaking about film and seeing as how he had a ball making this film with the cast included.... well we're just missing out on some interesting stories. A commentary with screenwriter William Monahan would have been a major plus as well.
B00005JPLU|5.0|WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A MASSIVE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I just got back from seeing a 7:15 screening of this movie, and I must say- It was the best movie I ever saw.<br /><br />I wonder why the snore-fests \\"Troy\\" and \\"Alexander\\" couldn't be more like this movie. It's everything that a mythology-based movie should be like. This movie will inevitably blow any other historical crap off the map.<br /><br />The movie begins with the history of King Leonidas. Ever since he was a child, he was exposed to such unusual cruelty. Now, he is a king, and is bringing an army of 300 Spartans against Persians. He climbs to a mountaintop, and finds a woman, who does a dance for him, and foretells that an army amongst them is ready to attack. Now, it's up to him and his army of 300 brave men.<br /><br />This is ultimately an epic story told on a SWEEPING scale. The visuals are cool, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is apocryphal with an ending with King Leonidas' self-sacrifice that had me hanging on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Now I would NOT recommend this for the young ones, as it is INCREDIBLY violent and gory. What it does do is recreate a violent country in a violent mythological time.<br /><br />Check it out!
0316776963|2.0|I bought this book when multiple people in a pseudo-book-club I was in remarked that it was \\"the funniest thing they'd ever read.\\"  I have loved humorous books in the past, ranging from political Al-Franken-type books to goofy sci-fi Douglas-Adams-type books. I did not love this book. It simply was not that funny. Sedaris is not that witty or clever, and he's a pretty sub-par writer. I have no interest in reading his other books, but I suppose he could care less, since he's already sold bajillions.
0767830555|5.0|I waited a long time to see this movie. I only knew that it was the film that John Hinckley watched before he tried to murder Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster. Hinckley pretty much tries to do a De Niro in real life, but it's here that De Niro really makes a name for himself. After a few years of low budget films, and slowly working up the chain with \\"Bang The Drum Slowly\\", and \\"The Godfather 2\\" He tackles the character of Travis Bickle with reckless abandon. Bickle is a Veitnam vet who after serving over there is lost in America, and he drifts into a taxi-cab company one day to drive a cab. This is 70's America put on film masterfully by Scorsese as I like the clouds of smoke coming from the cab which reminds me of dream sequence. The dream is dead as no one wants to be the hero anymore. Veitnam has hardened America's hearts and minds. However, the same people that \\"Turned On, Tuned In, and Dropped Out\\" are still doing it in the 70's, but this time they do it from behind a desk as they are now no longer dirty hippies, but clean-cut businessmen, and women. They have now taken the stance that it just doesn't matter anymore. I see this as Bickle sees the drek that NYC has become, and how people just don't want to deal with you, or know your pain unless you do something for them, and this is evident when Bickle sees Betsy played by Cybill Shepphard. Betsy is a campaign manager for the canadate for the President of the United States, and Bickle wants to volunteer, but to get close to Betsy. Well anyway it's 1976, and Veitnam has been over for a year, and the Christian revival that went down in Dallas in 1972 has waned out, and this is what we're left with as Bickle has 1,001 nightmares in the backseat of his cab, but the one that touches him the most is a 12 year old prostitute played by Foster who had only done Disney movies before this. Bickle decides to help her out, and gives her money, and then does the next big thing which is to kill her pimp which gives him15 minutes of fame, and he is labelled as a hero for doing this. I feel that this is what was going on in Hinckley's mind when he went to D.C. to murder Reagan as Reagan in his first months as President would make alot of changes that are still rippling through America today, and some aren't for the better. I guess this is why \\"Rocky\\" beat out \\"Taxi Driver\\" for best picture of 1976 because with \\"Rocky\\" it's about a person who came out of nowhere, and took on the champ in the boxing ring. This is what America had come up with to heal the wounds that Veitnam left on her as with \\"Rocky\\" it gave America something to cheer about again where \\"Taxi Driver\\" was about an Anti-Hero that killed bad to bring about good?, or did it? I mean it was bad enough that the main character served in Vietnam, but to make him a hero because he killed a pimp to save a 12 year old prostitute was not America's cup of tea back then. I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that it showed the negatives, or what, but those who did go to Vietnam they deserve the honor and respect that all our servicemen deserve. Perhaps the final scene is rather memorable as Bickle picks up Betsy in his cab, and drives her home as she's going that way, and all of a sudden because he killed the pimp she's looking at him in a different light now as someone she may want to date. However, Bickle isn't buying it now as yes he made a mistake by taking her to porno movie, but after he tries to apologize to her, and make things right it takes him killing a pimp to get her to think differently about him well that's too much. This is a movie not for the kids definitely, and probably not for some adults either. It's a taste of how Americans, and humans in general have been pretty much isolating themselves from each other for one reason, or another, and it's a sad thing to see happen, and over 30 years later it's still happening, and in some ways it's worse today than it was in 1976.
0395389496|5.0|My son who is 3 years old loves trains. Actually he is a fanatic of trains and everything which has trains in it. Because of that, I decided to buy this book, even if it is not in my native language Icelandic, because my son absolutely adores the DVD movie \\"The polar express\\".<br /><br />This book doesn't exist in Icelandic and it only took me few mintues to translate it into Icelandic (3 pages in Microsoft Word :) ), so I could read it more easily for him (not always have to translate while I'm reading).<br /><br />Well, he was absolutely thrilled when he found out that this was the same train as in the DVD movie and he really loves the book (even if we have totally different system of Santa Clauses here, they are actually 13 here in Iceland and they live in the mountains!). But for a three year old, that really doesn't matter, it is all about the train.<br /><br />And the pictures in this book are so beautiful.  Every page has a very large picture and 1-2 sentences of text.<br /><br />I really recommend this book, especially for the little train-lovers!

B000002J09|5.0|How do we define great?  This album is about the fourth best selling album in the U.S., with more than 23 million copies sold, and the eleventh best selling album in the world.  This album appears at position #66 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the greatest 500 albums of all time.  As for the group, Led Zeppelin is ranked #1 on VH1's list of the 100 greatest artists of hard rock.  Led Zeppelin has sold more than 300 million albums worldwide.  By any definition you choose, Led Zeppelin was a great group and this album is their greatest album.  Led Zeppelin is an important part of the history of hard rock.<br /><br />Great is more than a word.  Great is also an accurate description for the eight songs on this CD that range from the dynamic \\"Black Dog\\" to the peace and beauty of \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  The range of styles is broad, from the hard rock of songs like \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\" to the folk elements of \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"  This album makes a very good attempt at being a perfect rock album.<br /><br />The opening song is \\"Black Dog.\\"  This blues-infused rock moves and shakes from beginning to end with clever guitar work and imaginative (for that time) vocals.  The song is heavily sexual and speaks of a woman who will break your heart and maybe your soul, but this guy needs a mature woman who will help him settle down.<br /><br />The song \\"Rock and Roll\\" keeps up the pace.  The song opens with a grand drum solo reminiscent of 1950's and 1960's rock and roll.  The lead guitar keeps the rhythm driving hard and steady through this song that makes numerous nostalgic references.<br /><br />\\"The Battle of Evermore\\" has several oddities.  The song was inspired by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.  Robert Page uses a mandolin throughout the song, giving the music in this song a folk flavor.  This song also features the late Sandy Denny, a folk singer formerly with the folk-rock group Fairport Convention, as a guest vocalist.  This song relies significantly on vocals.  The effect is marvelous and makes this rare style of song a must-have for fans of fantasy-oriented rock.<br /><br />The eight minute song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is next.  This song was heavily played on FM stations in the 1970's, even though the song was never released as a single.  The guitar solo in this song is absolutely phenomenal and is probably one of the greatest rock guitar solos.  The song begins with a strong folk flavor.  The speed and power of the song builds from the beginning, ultimately transitioning into a guitar and drum-driven powerhouse, pulsing its way into your soul.  This song is an excellent example of the beauty and complexity that rock music can achieve.<br /><br />The song \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" contains references to the psychedelic era.  The reference to packing bags for the Misty Mountains appears to be a direct reference to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  The music is hard-driving rock with a lead guitar line repeating a rhythm throughout.  The lyrics contain surreal elements, which in songs written after this era are often matched with ethereal music.  Led Zeppelin kept the pace pulse-pounding from beginning to end.  This song has catchy hooks and is a great party song, but may be overlooked by some listeners because of the other great music on this album.<br /><br />\\"Four Sticks\\" has nothing to do with the lyrics, but refers to John Bonham's use of two drumsticks per hand.  This powerful song is a love song with a strong repetitive beat.  I enjoy listening to this very good song that is overshadowed somewhat by the presence of the other great songs on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Going to California\\" slows the pace with a folk flavor.  This song is a tribute to folk great Joni Mitchell, and is also the shortest song on this CD.  This clever song uses some very cool vocal effects to offset the staid pace of the song and the acoustic nature of the music.  Though the song seems as though it may be a little out of place given the hard rock songs that surround it, the change in pace gives a listener a break before the final song, which is the second longest song on this CD.<br /><br />The final song used an acoustic trick.  \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" used an echoed drumbeat to create a false hit between drum beats.  This song has several changes in pace and style that make this song enjoyable to hear.  The thick pace that opens the song gives way to faster moments.  You can readily hear a harmonica that creates even more interesting musical moments in this song, particularly since the harmonica and Jimmy Page's guitar seem to play off each other.  This song is another of the great songs on this album.<br /><br />Being one of the first of anything is special.  Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and King Crimson were among the first rock groups that put a much harder edge on rock music.  Pounding drums, dynamic guitars, omnipresent bass and chilling vocals were all characteristics of this new music.  However, Led Zeppelin avoided falling into the trap that many later groups have fallen into by changing the pace and style of the songs throughout the CD.  Led Zeppelin realized that acoustic and folk music could exist side-by-side with powerhouse rock, and the comparison heightens the drama of the rock music.  Many albums are called seminal that are not.  This album probably came a little late to be truly seminal, but it has paved the way for metal and other hard rock.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin, you have this CD already.  If you are a fan of classic hard rock, you have this CD.  If you have yet to appreciate this music and you are interested in the roots of hard rock, this is one of the albums you have to get for your collection.<br /><br />Enjoy!break before the final song, which is the second longest song on this CD.

B00005JPLU|5.0|\\"Throw down your weapons!\\"  \\"Come and Get Them!\\" <br />Spoken by King Leonidas as the Spartans form phalanx as a single mind.  My husband has a tattoo of \\"molon labe\\" Greek for \\"come and get them\\"). <br /> <br />Anyway, this is how to do a war movie based on a semi-legendary battle. You can't do it without CGI, so make it blatant. The other best-known line is \\"then we will fight in the shade\\" followed by that beautiful arching leap, which would have been so much less exciting in real time. You can't make it completely historically accurately (that would be History Channel), so play up the theatric. You can't get too far into the nastier details of Spartan culture (such as the helots), without the audience losing sympathy for the 300, so just leave them out. You don't want any actor to overshadow his character, so use character actors. <br /> <br />The movie is visually stunning, once you get past its being a moving graphic novel, not a moving watercolor (which was the style of Lord of the Rings). The characters look like they were modeled on statuary and ancient coins. The 300 don't have 6-packs, they have 12-packs, and oh my, the definition of their arms and legs.... The Spartans are truly Spartan, in their words, their costumes, their sets. In contrast, the Persians are adorned with all the treasures of Asia. The fight between 2 Spartans and some ridiculous number of Persians is wonderful to watch.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Bravo!  <br /> <br />I was totally uplifted by each and every page of this book and it filled me with such a feeling of warmth and joy and happiness and possibility, that I read a bit in it each day, just to gather that feeling to me again. <br /> <br />I will say that the one thing about reviews of books or movies is that the reviewers try so hard to make you agree with their own points. I can tell you what I think about every single book I've ever read and you may or may not agree with me. But if something peeks your interest, as this book must have or you would not be reading these reviews...then again...\\"you owe it to yourself\\" to pick the book up and read it and see if the content rings true with you. Read the reviews, but don't take others' opinions as yours.  Decide for yourself what you will read, view, like or dislike.  And above all else...enjoy the adventure!!!
B00092ZL80|3.0|When I saw this DVD with both bands at the same concert, I saw it as a must have. <br />The good points first - good introduction with both bands performimg 3-4 numbers. Earth Wind & Fire sound as good as they ever have on any CD I have heard. Time has not changed their sound, just brilliant. <br />The DVD sound and picture quality are very good, as you would expect from recent recordings. <br />Now for the disappointing stuff. I was really looking forward to hearing EWF's song, \\"After The Love Has Gone\\". The lead singer from Chicago actually wrote it and HE comes on to do the lead vocals. EWF's vocal backing are brilliant but the song is ruined by the Chicago singer - his voice has deteriorated over the years and struggles to get the notes out - you would not recognise him if you have not heard the band since the 1970's or 1980's. <br />Chicago's best easy listening song \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" is sung by the EWF lead singer - although he can still sing and does a nice job, it does not sound like the song you wanted to hear Chicago sing. <br />Chicago these day, have several young singers in the band and with the aging lead singer struggling a bit, none of the vocals sound anything like the 70's an 80's recordings you are used to hearing. <br />The concert is still well produced and put together, but I wish I had bought a DVD with just EWF on it.

Selections of music were great. All in all an excellent presentation.  However, the sound quality on the initial disc I received was poor. It was static filled, especially on the instumental parts.  I returned the disc and received a new one before I sent the old one back. The Amazon return policy worked like a charm. I was looking forward to hearing a better version.  The second disc was not quite so bad, but still had static in it. Poor engineering is all I can say.

A stepfather who is more of a phantom, a mother who appears to be certifiable, a dead child from many years ago, a teen-age girl who has bouts of sheer awfulness, and our narrator, a thirty-something who has cut words into most of her body. If that weren't bad enough, there are two murders in a small town, and no one in town wants to think that one of the residents is guilty. The story moves along at a good pace, and the mystery as to the identity of the murderer is left until almost the very end of the book, where it will come as a shock and surprise to most readers, even the most astute ones. This is an excellent first novel, and I look forward to this new author's next work.

B000LXH0AE|3.0|Even more all over the map than usual in the ratings, which makes sense with a film that has much to dislike and yet much to enjoy. This is a genial, none-too-complex tale that uses the same old Hollywood cliches to fill out the paint by numbers characters. Boring guy who counts his toothbrush strokes (he must be in need of a lightening up) perky anti-establishment gal with cool tattoos (she needs a man...hmm, wait she needs this man!) struggling writer who smokes too much, and her driven muse. These are the standard people in such a film, all right out of the cabinet of pre-packaged movie characters. Seen them before, often.<br /><br />There were also innumerable annoyances. First, the narrative we actually hear spoken by Emma Thompson is awful. Folks, that is not a masterpiece, that is lame and silly prose. The screenwriter may flatter himself, but to these ears it was not gold but pyrite. Oh well. Masterpieces are hard to write. (No kidding!) But the more troublesome aspect to me was the accuracy of the story Thompson was writing. She wrote about Crick in the guitar shop as he was there. OK, but when the living Harold Crick was running to make the phone call to her and she wrote \\"The phone rang\\" to whom was her Harold Crick character calling? His author? No, I think not. Supernatural/time-travel stories are hard to keep consistent, and this little problem often made it perplexing. he still had a life when she wasn't writing about it. Or are all the characters hers? And his transformation from uptight number cruncher to sweet and gentle lover is not only unpleasant to watch, it feels about as likely as Mike Tyson becoming a caring lover.<br /><br />And yet this is not a bomb. Though Queen Latifah is dreadful (another incarnation of the Magic Negro Hollywood so loves) everyone else works hard to make it come alive. The film is so straightforward, the characters, despite their uni-dimensional existence, so earnest, and the look so good that I left it pleased, not annoyed.

0786191465|5.0|Some of the best books I have ever read, were usually recommended to me either by a friend or teacher.  <br /> <br />Man's search for meaning is truly an inspirational book for those who do not have a religion or purpose to their life. It shows that a human being can withstand almost anything as long as they feel they have a purpose.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to teenagers as well as those in college. I may also recommend this book to agnostics and atheists, it might give meaning to their lives.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|For my money, this is one of the better Hollywood pure entertainment films made in recent years. It's a lot of fun, the cast is as good as they come, the twists and turns in the plot are neat, the dialogue crackles, the direction is crisp, and it's a heist movie, one of the greatest of all subgenres.  The one disappointing thing about it for me is that when the heist's ultimate masterplan is eventually revealed, you realize that it hinged on some very specific things to this particular bank and situation that couldn't be replicated elsewhere, so that takes away a bit of the satisfaction out of watching it unfold, to be perfectly honest.  That quibble aside, highly recommended.    By the way, there is a nice extended version of the interrogation scene on the DVD but be warned that it runs about 20 minutes (!) and contains many re-edited elements that were used in a slightly different order in the film; maybe not a good idea to view that feature immediately after watching the film given its surprising length.

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I can understand why reviews of this movie are so split down the middle.  It's a very strange and weird idea: Shoot a film noir and do the dialogue and structure as if you were adapting a Hammett novel back in the day, but set and shoot the movie at a contemporary California high school.  Either you think this is brilliant or you think it's totally idiotic. <br /> <br />From my own experience and from talking to others, I think it is tough to get into this movie primarily because of the patterns of speech. Everybody talks very fast with a stylized delivery as if they were in a movie from the 30s or 40s, using a lot of slang most of us don't use, and the sound quality isn't so great. My suggestion to anyone who wants to give this a go but winds up having a hard time is to try it out with SUBTITLES, believe it or not (and I am *not* kidding about this). Because once I did, I realized I was mishearing certain words and I started to pick up on the rhythms, hear things correctly, and the dialogue started to sound natural; eventually I got into the flow of it enough to get rid of them (though I admit in a few scenes I wound up going back and putting them back on just to make sure I got the lines right). <br /> <br />You might ask, what's the point of doing a movie this way if it winds up creating a problem like that?  Well, I think that the reason for dealing with this is because this oddball strategy of Rian Johnson's winds up actually creating one of the more successful attempts at a contemporary film noir. For whatever strange reason, the artificiality of the dialogue and farcical nature of the proceedings works quite well once you give in to the conceit. Many other attempts at doing a modern neo-noir wind up feeling way too \\"retro\\" and nostalgic and they stumble over themselves trying to figure out how to be modern but yet try to keep all the elements of old detective thrillers that people miss and want to see (see Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for an example of sort of the tricky questions that come up in trying to do contemporary noir). The high school setting actually defuses that problem because it is silly and anachronistic already, so having modern day kids talking in old fashioned out of date tough guy lingo is no more strange than having anyone else, adult or not, talking that way these days. The plot is predictably convoluted in the old noir-detective style and there are all the usual archetypes and manipulations. Somehow they seem sort of fresh in the setting of high school. And since most of us tended to discover detective novels in our teen years, it seems perfectly fitting to project their tropes out into that world, to imagine that high school is a microcosm of all the things one read about in pulp fiction. <br /> <br />So I'll take sides with the \\"pro\\"-Brick crowd; I enjoyed it.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|This movie was okay but if you read the books you will see how much you are missing. They are the type of books that once you read them, they keep coming back to haunt your thoughts until to read them again and again.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I am glad I chose to post my reviews without my real name because I am hugely horribly embarrassed to have to admit that I had not ever seen this movie until just recently and was totally unaware of what an incredibly great achievement it is--yes, I am an idiot. That this was made in 1974 is truly amazing. It is remarkably well crafted, has great acting from a great cast, a funny and clever script, was way ahead of its time in ideas and filmmaking technique, and so feels totally modern even thirty years later.  If you are like me and are committed to the horror genre and for whatever reason haven't caught up with this, you really must watch this next to have a proper understanding of horror history, no excuses.
0743289684|4.0|This is a terrific book, a great gripping read. I agree with so much of what Ali has to say. But, unfortunately, I don't think she's the right spokesperson for the moderate muslim viewpoint because she claims to no longer believe in God, and for that reason, she can be too easily dismissed by her critics. If she had somehow emerged from her ordeal as a believer, then she would be a true moderate Muslim. But she's not, she's an athiest, so, really she speaks for women's rights from an athiest perspective. And that really is too bad. I'm not criticising her atheism...I just know that what Islam needs is more moderate voices from believers..people who speaks from within the religion. What we have here is someone who has stepped away from Islam and then chosen to speak against the entire religion....which eliminates her credibility among believers.  <br /> <br />So, I'm still looking for the eloquent moderate Islamic woman..a woman as well spoken, passionate and smart as Ali, but who still believes in her faith, a moderate version of her faith, that will ideally resonate with millions of people. I understand Ali's anger. And reading her experiences, I felt myself getting angry too, at the ignorance of Islamic men, who destroy their chances for progress by hobbling half of thier population. <br /> <br />The whole world needs moderate Islamists, now more than ever.
B00008WJBU|3.0|The odd thing when you watch the opening scene of Intacto is a weird feeling of deja vu as you realize the opening scene of the Cooler appears to be stolen from Intacto which predates it by two years.  That said, I would agree with the more critical person who said that the logic of luck in the Cooler is a bit easier to follow that the concept of luck employed in Intacto. (The Cooler has its own problems, however.)  <br /> <br />Possible spoiler alert. Like the Cooler, Intacto has a kind of feel-good message underneath it that love and emotion eventually have some impact on luck in the end, which doesn't quite work for me, honestly, especially not in this one. In order to get us there, the script connives to get the hero to wager unknowingly the luck of a woman he loves but that forced plot development seems simply to raise lots of questions about the mechanism of the bets and how a simple photograph carries with it anything about the person if that person has not agreed to surrender their luck (as seemed to be necessarily the case in another sequence); it confuses the issue of how exactly the luck obtaining process, which the film depicts but glosses over in the details, is supposed to really work. And it also just feels wrong in a movie of ideas like this one to imply so simplistically that true selfless love is supposed to bring good results (ergo the people who died in the camps instead of the Luckiest man in the world didn't love and so they didn't have luck?). Perhaps the filmmaker has a completely well thought out explanation of it all but it doesn't quite come across in the film and so it's hard to feel by the end of it any real satisfaction in the plot events. <br /> <br />Intacto does contain a number of very memorable and distinctive scenes of luck challenges or contests: the forest scene being probably the best of them. This is an odd film overall but it has a certain strange charm to it despite its pronounced failings, so I could see things to be gainedfrom watching it if you're interested in the luck theme as I was.

1582701709|3.0|I recently finished reading \\"The Secret\\" and I think it is kind of a new age spin on \\"The Power of Positive Thinking.\\"  I would like to believe this really works and am putting it to the test.  I have doubts though.  For example, I don't believe all of the people killed in the Holocaust brought it on themselves as Ms. Byrne implies.  Also, I think it is very hard to actually feel like you have something (and this is a must according to Ms. Byrne) when you obviously don't.  I can see saying affirmations and visualizing, but really feeling like I already have it, well, that's though to do. <br /> <br />The quotations from philosophers and inventors are very interesting, and I do think positive thinking can really help people attain their desires and be happier in general even if those desires don't manifest themselves.  Many people who are in genuinely bad situations or who may have depression have a very difficult time thinking positively on a regular basis.   <br /> <br />I found this book to be for the most part insightful, but in some places pretty far out.  I did take away the message to put a positive spin on my thinking.  Who knows?  Maybe I really will get rich, slender, and move into my dreamhouse!
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Is it too much to ask people not to give away the ending in their reviews.  I happen to have seen the movie prior to reading the previous review by Donna, but she would have spoiled it if I had not.  Use a little common sense.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|I saw this album on just about every \\"best of 2006\\" list in the local indy papers and music sites, etc.  I heard \\"Great Salt Lake\\" on KEXP (online radio station).  It was one of those songs that stuck in my head, and not because it had some annoying pop hook.  I think it's the singers voice.  Like Dean Wareham from Luna, his voice sounds like so many lost memories from childhood, come back to share their wisdom.  Not to take anything away from the rest of the band, but this guy could put out a solo album of nothing but his singing and it would sell.  That being said, this band is very tight, talented, and I will definately be looking for their next outing.

0553328255|5.0|Whether you've read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories or not, at only 10 bucks this collection is a must own for any fans of detective fiction.<br /><br />This edition is highly usable and highly readable - it's cheap, and it's also compact and easy to read.  Breaking it into two reasonably small paperbacks makes it very convenient to take with you on a trip, for example.  It's also an easy, convenient way to get all four novels and all the short stories.  Sure it isn't a pretty hardcover edition that will look good on the bookshelf - this edition is meant to be read.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of Holmes and are debating whether to buy this collection, I'd highly recommend it.  If you're not already a fan but like detective fiction in general, you may as well shell out the measly 10 bucks for one of the original (and still one of the best, in my opinion) examples of the genre.

080726203X|4.0|This is a great novel that many middle school aged students read as part of their school curriculum.  As a teacher, I use the audio version to play in class to cover some chapters.  Since I don't listen from beginning to end and have to reset and start at different points for each class period, the CD's are a bit awkward.  The tracks are not recorded by chapter or page number so finding the spot where my students left off is sometimes tedious.  Other than that, the recording is great and the kids like the reader's voice and the accompanying music for dramatic effect.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|One person had reviewed this as \\"Could have almost been the Godfather of Spy movies..\\"<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />I thought the overall tone of the movie was brilliant, subtle, yet strong. very good screenplay. De Niro manages to extract the best from his actors. Matt Damon gave a good performance, as the cold CIA officer who has to make difficult decisions. I see that some reviewers have rated this as a slow movie. Maybe so, but if you adjust your pace with the movie and absorb the content, its a very well done movie in the end. Good plots, ideas etc..<br /><br />The not so good:<br /><br />Whoever did the casting for this movie, (i do not know how the process works, do the directors/ producers do it etc..) did a very bad job. Angelina Jolie, who maybe an accomplished actress in her own right, was very wrong for this role. somehow it just did not fit. and Robert de Niro playing General Bill Sullivan did not fit too much either. There were certain segments in the movie, which leaves much to the viewer's imagination.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />Good movie, recommend: 4 stars. I will be purchasing the dvd for my collection.

B00005JPLU|5.0|I take offense to critics and reviewers who dismiss \\"300\\" as a mere 'film for guys and fanboys.' I am neither a guy nor a fanboy.  As a history and movie buff, I had been anticipating this movie since I heard that it was being made early last year, and took even more interest in it when I heard of the cast.  I knew it was a movie I wanted to see and so this weekend, I invited five of my female friends to see it for a girls afternoon out and I am pleased to report that we all enjoyed it thoroughly. <br /> <br />\\"300\\" is a visual masterpiece with amazing battle sequences, an engrossing story and well drawn characters.  Most 'action' type movies come off with clunky dialogue and a poor storyline but Zack Snyder does an impressive job of casting little known (excepting Gerard Butler) but well respected British actors and filming almost completely on blue screen without sacrificing the storyline or losing its historical significance.  While other CGI-driven films come off as unconvincing and some laughably fake, \\"300\\" comes off as a visually stunning and eye-popping masterpiece.  This is a film that successfully blends art and action. In many ways, Zach Snyder is a visionary filmmaker and a worthy successor to the likes of Peter Jackson and George Lucas. <br /> <br />Another strength is in the story.  It is tightly woven and starts off with a background to the Spartan warrior code and how spartan boys are trained for combat at a very early age.  It then fast forwards to  the 'present' as messengers for King Xerxes of Persia visit King Leonidas of Sparta and order him to submit or die.  Leonidas then takes 300 of his best men to the 'hot gates' of Thermopylae to cut off the approaching Persian army.  What takes place is one of the most famous battles in history as the Spartans (and other Greeks) take on Xerxes' army of thousands (some even say millions), and their sacrifice paves the way for the unification of Greece as a nation. <br /> <br />I will not pretend that everything in this film is historically accurate but I was actually surprised that it came pretty close.  This is not the History Channel.  If you want an accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae then there are documentaries for that available.  This is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller, who depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in his book of the same name.  There are some changes, but they lend to the story and are completely plausible. <br /> <br />The casting is topnotch as well, eventhough they are not A-list names.  Gerard Butler (King Leonidas) carries the film but there are also standout performances from Lena Heady (Queen Gorgo), David Wenham (Dilios - and Faramir from 'The Lord of the Rings'), Michael Fassbender (Stelios - and Azazeal from the tv drama \\"Hex\\"), Dominic West (Theron), Vincent Regan (Captain) and newcomer Tom Wisdom (Astinos).  The actors who play Spartan warriors look the part - all tall, muscular and powerful.  The only character I didn't warm to was Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes who came off as over the top (though this was done on purpose).  <br /> <br />The action scenes are fast and furious, and there is a great deal of blood and violence. The interesting thing about this is that it doesn't come off as gory.  I mean, it's no worse than R-rated films like \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Troy\\" and I've seen scary movies that are far worse. The fight scenes are full of energy, with a mix of slow-motion and fast, battering-ram-like power, as the Spartans thrust their spears and swords at the enemy.  I have not seen powerful battle scenes like this since the 'Ride of the Rohirrim' sequence in \\"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King\\" and it is absolutely thrilling.  When the barrage of arrows from the Persians block out the sun and the Spartans push the Persians to their death at sea, it is both beautiful and awe-inspiring. <br /> <br />In summary, \\"300\\" is a movie that a wide range of audiences can enjoy.  History buffs will enjoy it because it is a fair and (for the most part) accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae.  Fanboys and comic book fans will enjoy it because of its Frank Miller roots and Zach Snyder's vision.  And most everyone else will enjoy it because it is an entertaining, engrossing film. \\"300\\" is a movie I plan to see again and again, and I trust it will be a part of my collection when it comes out on DVD.
B000MVQ9P2|4.0|This is a review of the US release.  \\"The Host\\" is a very enjoyable monster movie in the tradition of Godzilla.  The plot is simply - due to some chemical dumping, a mutated fish creature begins dining on civilians enjoying an afternoon along the banks of the Han River.  One unfortunate victim is a young girl whose devoted family (dull-witted father, devoted grandfather, alcoholic uncle, and archery expert aunt).  While trying to find and save the girl, the family members become victims of a Gov't conspiracy to hide the origins of the monster.  Unlike many other horror movies where the creature is hidden in the shadows, the monster in \\"The Host\\" appears very early in the story and in full daylight.  It is one ugly SOB and incredible fast - in the first attack scene I found myself startled and gasped out loud.  Special effects aside, the story has a strong human element - the family's lover and determination to save the girl, and their young girl's own pluckiness - showing exceptional bravery.  Best thing of all, the story has some unexpected turns and does not end with a traditional \\"Hollywood\\" ending.  The downsides are that the movie is a little long (the middle third could have been trimmed of some slow moving sub-plots), and frankly the US Gov't doesn't come-off too well either (but how many times have Hollywood films shown evil foreign scientists as the source of all evil?).  A humorous side note - many US cartoons are outsourced to Korea for the actual animation work, but \\"The Host\\" used a San Francisco company for the digital monster.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello.  The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.<br /><br />Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development. If fans were expecting a shot-for-shot remake, they obviously don't understand why Scorsese is regarded as one of the best directors of all time.

B000LXH0AE|2.0|I found myself staring at the screen in \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" and waiting for something imaginative to happen. And it never did.  Do not waste your time watching this movie. Sure it is supposed to be \\"artsy\\", but it does not even work on that level. I do watch quite a bit of movies, and chose to watch this one because I like Will Ferrell most of the time, and was willing to give him a chance in a more dramatic role, but he just can't pull it off. At times it seems like he's trying to be funny, but it is not appropriate. At other times he tries to be serious, and you can't believe it. It just wasn't a good movie.

1577314808|5.0|From the INTRODUCTION, I was floored!  This is a book that I use as a Bible for \\"right now\\" thinking.  It's not a piece that promotes impulsive or compulsive behavior...much to the contrary.  It's a work that compels you to actively BE in the current moment...it really is all we have.  Yesterday is forever gone, and tomorrow is an illusion that will never be...every moment we live is ALWAYS \\"now\\", therefore it's important to recognize this powerful truth and embrace it.  The sooner we come to this realization, we begin to tap into authenticity and live completely.  Read it not once; not twice; but as often as necessary to come to ultimate peace with \\"this moment\\", whatever it holds for you.

B000JBWWQ0|3.0|At first I thought this would be a lot like the DiVinci Code but here the Church is so much the bad guy as it is the political manipulators of the world though it is a bit vague who the main enemy is and who he's working for.  I have not read the book so I can't say how close the movie is to it.  I did think the ideas of the prophecy are fairly standard fare for new age spirituality which should not lessen them in any way: shouldn't truth be truth regardless of when or how it is revealed?  I felt each character was a bit brushed over quickly never really allowing me to feel too close to any one of them but I did get the sense that they believed in what they were doing.  I'd actually give this movie 3.5 stars it if were possible because I felt the characters were sincere and the situation possible if not probable.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, what can I say...Firefly is a shiny jewel in a sea of reality TV garbage. When I see the mindless junk on TV today, it seems insane for Fox to have treated Joss Whedon's Firefly the way they did. It seems that the Fox executive who made the decision to reject the original pilot, show the episodes out of order, and then cancel the series was a Hwoon dahn. Firefly has grown to be unstoppable. The show is simply awesome. After watching the last episode on the fourth disc, I wanted more. I now have this empty space in me that only more of the Firefly verse can fill. This show could easily have made 7 seasons worth of great episodes. Fans of Firefly see the awesome potential that this show had and still has. I love Firefly and Serenity the movie. <br /> <br />Here's my plea to Joss and any network or studio: <br />Please bring Firefly back! Or at least make another movie. Personally I would rather have the TV show back. What would it take to bring it back?  <br /> <br />\\"May not have been the winning side. Still not convinced it was the wrong one.\\"

B000005RRF|4.0|If you are only going to own one Marillion album it should be this one.  Yes, their \\"progressive rock\\" sound is a bit dated.  And it's a bit over dramatic at times.  But this album is still worth owning.  If you are considering trying this band, this is the album to buy.
B00000099Y|5.0|It was a time of confusion and chaos, a time in which direction had no meaning.<br /><br />Music was a means to connect with something, feel as if he or she singing was speaking directly to you. I discovered TOOL while living in Naples Italy, in discovering Tool, I discovered music, and in music I discovered peace. Have you ever heard people say (for example) the 1985 Chicago Bears are the greatest football team ever? The Bears aren't the greatest team in the world, but the 1985 Bears compared to any other team, in any other time frame were the absolute greatest. Now I'm not saying the 1985 Bears are the greatest football team ever, quite frankly I don't care, but I am trying to make a point. If you look at TOOL during the period in which they made Anemia, it was perfect timing for such music to come out, the lyrics are perfect, the sound, the look, everything. That TOOL can't be compared to the Stones, the Beatles, Sabbath, Hendricks, Zeppelin, ANYONE. That Album made them the greatest, at that time no one was even close to the magic created by TOOL. Now don't get me wrong, I'm the biggest TOOL fan out there, but even I have to be realistic and say there not the greatest, to me they are, but I have no authority to determine the greatest of all time. Over all the Bears are an OK team but the 1985 Bears could probably never be beaten. Over all I think TOOL is great yet overall I think the Beetles are perfect. It's ok though because I'm comforted in knowing that when TOOL made Anemia, it was flawless, perfect. It can not be compared to anything else. I know that the magic is always with them, I'm always comforted when buying a CD, I know it'll be great; they've never let me down. TOOL brought me through a period where I was lost. I will always be thankful for the spiritual connection I had with the music.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|Fernando Meirelles, off of his success with City of God, reveals another dark environment - post-colonial Africa.  The story revolves around a career diplomat searching for secrets of his wife's tragic death.  Stunning imagery and a dark tale is told - contains a realistic (I'd guess) portrait of some dirty deeds that may actually be going on.  Assumes the worst in post-colonial behavior from Western powers, which may be a turnoff for some.  The pace can be slow, which can be a turnoff for others.  Certainly an interesting and eye-openning movie.

B00005JMYI|2.0|Will Farrell plays a sexist 70s news anchorman.  Christina Applegate his competition.  Sounds funny.  Has some laughs.  But it's really not one of his best.

074356619X|5.0|I have always lived my life this way.  I haven't always had a name for it. <br /> <br />Since I was a very small child, I have understood the value of gratitude and I have always known what you think about most is what you attract.  As I was growning up and throughout my adult life, I have found time and time again that asking, believing and giving thanks (because I am certain whatever it is I have asked for will come) works and when it works, it is more wonderful than I imagined. <br /> <br />My life has been very blessed.  Only when I focus on the negative or what others say is possible, have I ever found life to be anything other than a fantastic adventure. <br /> <br />This has been spoken and written about before, but I find each perspective and presentation to deepen my experiance. I adore this CD and DVD and highly recommend it to everyone.
0385337388|5.0|Set in a time frame 30 years ago, this sexually explicit novel portrays an accurate description of a large teaching hospital and a resident's first year of practice after medical school.  While some of the characters are clearly stereotypes, it is easy for modern practitioners and the public to identify with the stories and experiences described in this book.  Even now, the residents at my own facility reference the \\"contrived\\" terminology and suffer through the moral/ethical dilemmas recounted in this novel.  I highly recommend it as a character study and as one person's account of the challenges of modern medicine.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was thrilled to experience this compilation of Beatle music.  The subtleties and nuances of the editing were in a word brillant.  Only someone with the passion and insight of George Martin could come up with a venue for the goldmine that is the Beatles' music.  It was great to hear songs other than the \\"HITS\\" (even though some would say that all their music were the hits).  The lead-ins to the differnt songs were imaginative and fun.  My only gripe is that there wasn't more.  Even as large a collection as it was it still was not enough.  Of course, that leaves room for another?!?!?!?!?!

0767020308|5.0|I enjoyed this adaptation of EMMA and highly recommend it.  <br /> <br />Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker. She feels like she's able to pair off the people around her and tries to do so without the individuals asking her for help.  Emma, played by Kate Beckinsale is headstrong, all knowing, a gossip and mettlesome. She can also be caring, sweet and kind.  The truth is Emma doesn't even recognize the men who are infatuated with her, much less be able to discern the attractions between others.  She makes some terrible blunders and its interesting to see how everything is straightened out in the end. Mark Strong portrays Emma's friend Mr. Knightly and Olivia Willis plays Jane Fairfax. I found the sequences where the characters sing and dance to be very charming and great entertainment.   <br /> <br />I have also reviewed the other adaptation of this film with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam in the starring rolls. That was also very enjoyable! Truth be told, the two films are so different that they are too difficult to even compare to one another. I really believe they are equally well done.  Jane Austen may prefer this version as I think it's closer to her original story. <br />
B000E1155E|5.0|Is the appreciation of SWEET rock, age related? I've been discovering musical gems for around 40 years, including the best of the Beatles and the Stones, as they were released... but it's as simple as this: I know what I like. And this CD is extraordinary! As a reference point, I also love Spoon's, \\"Gimme Fiction\\". That, and this, are probably the two best CDs I've heard in the last 5 years. These days, when EVERY SONG is worth your time, you know you have something special. Enjoy!
0743298020|3.0|Setterfield writes an interesting story. But her tone seems affected, as if she typed it wearing white laced gloves while sipping tea and krimpets. And the male characters were so dainty, fragile or just downright oblivious (as compared to the supernaurally strong women in the book), I got the feeling she's a bit of a misandrist. Strong beginning and middle. Struggling to get through the end.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|A DVD well worth having . The addition of Hayley Westenra to Celtic Woman was  brilliant. The scenery around Slane Castle and the  <br />costumes on Celtic woman are fantastic.
B00005JPCF|2.0|If you have children, you'll understand what I mean. Both kids (my daughter and her cousin) were 5, so they're beyond it. They both had small drinks. They were bored and confused. Frankly, so was I. <br /> <br />The music was odd. I didn't understand how \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" and other 60's and 70's faves were supposed to work in the movie. For me, they didn't. The characters were annoying, except the pseudo-Latino penguins. They were funny, but not around long enough. I didn't get the message of the movie. Was it \\"be yourself\\" or \\"you have to help others\\" or \\"people aren't all that bad\\" or \\"don't give up\\"? It never really hit any of those messages properly. <br /> <br />Close to the end was a little dark plot-wise, but it was so muddled that it had little effect.  <br /> <br />The \\"controversy\\" that humans are harming the environment was, well, not a controversy. The people in the movie were wrecking their habitat. It doesn't mean all people wreck the environment. I think it's funny that people call that some sort of liberal message. Last I checked, I didn't get my political points of view from kids' movies, and neither do kids. <br /> <br />It had a few moments, but it gets old. The kids wished they had seen Charlotte's Web.
B0000024RZ|5.0|was also the first one I purchased, although it was his third release. It is dark, depressing in spots, bleak and bitter, but oh, so powerful back in 1963! Buying Dylan back then,even for a college sophomore was kind of a radical act in my somewhat racist family. We were lifelong denizens of New Jersey, but uncomfortable with all the civil rights agitation just the same. I bought the record because I had seen Bob perform \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" on the Steve Allen late-night TV variety show. To find out what made Dylan famous BEFORE he went to electrified rock, get this item.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer is seriously talented. No...I mean, seriously. I have his other two CDs, only the 1st of which I was impressed by. Continuum blows them both out of the water. Although, I was a bit scared when I heard \\"Waiting for the World to Change\\" on the radio as it struck me as a basic fluff pop tune.<br /><br />However--once you listen to the rest of the CD, you truly get the full measure of his ability. Gravity--is a beautifully done bluesy tune.  Vultures is old school Steely Dan/Doobie Brothers grooving. My favorite tune by far on this CD is \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\". It's ridiculous how beautiful that song is.<br /><br />I'm amazed that a guy as young as John could offer such insightful, beautifully arranged compositions.  It's nice to know that there's still talent out there.
B000J4OYRW|4.0|Every documentary the boys release just reach to feed the great wall of mistery around them. <br />Out of touch, they have achieved a star quality that reminds me of the legendary 40's and 50's stars. <br />What would I give to see them jumping into a pool, or chewing a sandwich, or getting drunk with friends...to see they're human and fallible... <br />I love their work and approach to music, culture and life in general terms, but as I grow older, I would appreciate if the quitted their impenetrability. <br /> <br />The DVD is great, interesting, wit, and their presence impeccable. <br />Fans won't learn much about them, but it's nice to have fresh news about the most intelligent, refined duo of our time. And, have you noticed how notorious their influence has becomed these days? Is it good they're getting related to Robbie and the old bitch (a.k.a. Madonna)? Not sure...
B00005JPLU|5.0|Movies are supposed to be entertaining and 300 delivers.  I can't remember the last time I heard the audience clap at the end of a movie.   <br />As a Greek, I am not even bothered about mythological embellishments of a historical event.  As a side benefit, this film will cause youth to want to investigate and search history to check the facts.  It will create an interest in history, something that is missing from today's youngsters.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I love everything these wonderful ladies do.  They all have such great voices and the setting of this particular DVD seems to bring out the best. I especially liked the drum backup and the addition of Hayley to the group was a plus.  Wish I could see them live.

B000M341QE|2.0|I can't believe this film won as best picture over FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and BABEL.  I gave it two stars for superb acting.  Although the story line was good, all the cussing and killing got aggravating after awhile.  I WAS glad Whalberg killed Damon in the end.  I hate it when the bad guy wins.

(It's been translated more than any book besides the Bible I've heard.) I love sharing it with people which is why I will teach it as long as I'm teaching and I will read it aloud to my children when I have them.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is the second live concert by these amazing ladies. I have both and enjoy them often.  A sixth woman has been added to the group for this concert, they are all so very talented young women and the setting for this at Slane Castle, outdoors at night, is spectacular in it's own right. The arrangments vary from solo to group harmony ,classic to Irish melodies with full orchestra. There is also backstage footage of the planning and putting the show together. There are as many talented people behind the scenes as there are on the stage.Great editing with many camera angles and great sound quality make for a very enjoyable performance. I highly recommend this to all.

1582701709|5.0|I am enjoying the book and feel it has a lot of good points. I've been using the methods described and they seem to be working. I've had the book for 2 weeks and have viewed the video 5 times. My house has been For Sale 30 days, I had no showings for 3 weeks, then the last week showed the house to 3 different families, 2 made offers and we will close in less than 30 days. Does it work? I don't know, but I think I'll keep using the thinking. I have an interview this week and still need to land the job, no I mean I already have the position. They love me!

B000002L7J|3.0|The Smiths' second album of new material is essential listening for an unlikely reason: it contains some the band's most mediocre songs. Now, \\"mediocre\\" is a relative term of course, considering that we are talking about the greatest band to emerge in the last quarter-century, i.e., since The Jam broke up in '82. It isn't that Morrissey's voice sounds bad (how could it?), or that Johnny Marr's guitar playing is less than tasteful.  It's just that somehow the words and the music just aren't as great as one would expect.<br /><br />Most of the tracks on this album are not particularly well-known ones. However, \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" pops up in the middle of the American issue. This is one of the band's best-known and best-loved songs.  It is not, however, one my personal favorites, if for no other reason than it is over six-and-a-half minutes long.  For a group whose music is informed by classic pop ideals, The Smiths sure have a tendency to let their songs run a bit too long.  This is especially to the detriment of the closing tracks. The nearly 7-minute \\"Barbarism Begins at Home\\" is quite good, as is the title track (even if it is a bit, dare I say, ham-fisted), but they just go on forever, and therefore lose some of their impact in the process.<br /><br />Other than \\"How Soon Is Now?\\", the only song that will be familiar to neophyte Smiths fans is the excellent single \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\", which includes the fathomlessly clever line \\"It was dark as I drove the point home\\".  Not surprisingly, The Smiths are more successful with shorter songs.  \\"What She Said\\", \\"Nowhere Fast\\", and \\"Well I Wonder\\" are the album's best songs. \\"I Want the One I Can't Have\\", on the other hand, expresses what was even by this point in his career a pretty trite Morrissey sentiment.  And I still haven't mentioned the opening tracks, \\"The Headmaster Ritual\\" and \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\". Sadly, there isn't really much to say about them, apart from that they sound a bit juvenile and uninspired. (Although the \\"Marie's the Name of His Latest Flame\\" riff on the latter is a nice touch).<br /><br />Given the excitement that had built up around The Smiths by 1985, it is not surprising that Meat Is Murder entered the UK album chart at #1.  Fans were certainly justified in their expectations for the album, and were right to rush out and by it.  Unfortunately, the material on the album proved to be disappointing by any standards.  Fortunately, it was not enough to bring down the band's hopes, as they re-emerged in the finest form of their career with their next release.  While Meat is Murder is not essential in the all-embracing sense of the term, it is worth hearing for that very reason.  After all, every great band has at least one album that demonstrates what they sound like at their not-so-great.  In the case of The Smiths, that album is Meat Is Murder.he \\"Marie's the Name of His Latest Flame\\" riff on the latter is a nice touch).

B000KCHZK6|1.0|I was excited to see a new album from Norah Jones that I immediately put it on my wish list.  After listening to the tracks and reading the reviews, I promptly took it off my wish list.  I was so disappointed to see that Norah has gone the way of so many artists thinking that we want a political science lesson from entertainers.  If I want \\"entertainment\\" views of politics, I can watch the evening news for free.  Norah, be different, not a lemming, go back to making music and leave politics to the TV \\"news\\" reporters. <br />
1582701709|4.0|\\"The Secret\\", and other books like it, are describing a belief system that was practiced by indigenous tribal cultures throughout the millenia. It is called, \\"Sympathetic Magic\\". When tribes, like the Native Americans for example, were preparing for a buffalo hunt, they would first do a ritualistic killing in a pre-hunt ceremony, where the some of the hunters would dress in buffalo skulls and skins, while the other hunters would mock the killing of the buffalo. This re-enactment would ensure them of a successful hunt, so they will be ensured of an abundance of food through the cold, barren, winter months. It is the \\"Law of Attraction\\" that this book is addressing. <br /> <br />When reading this and other books that deal with the subject matter, one should keep in mind that having a positive outlook, doing visualizations and affirmations, or keeping a photo of one's goal is helpful on an etheric level, BUT this does not mean that one should not do the work to achieve that particular goal on a mundane level. In other words, the Native Americans did not do sympathetic magic for food, then sit back and wait for the buffalo to fall into their laps. They migrated with the buffalo herds, planned strategies, chose the strongest hunters, and the finest bowmen and went out to hunt the buffalo. It took an exorbitant amount of work to gain success. <br /> <br />If one is looking for the ideal job, for instance, on a spiritual level a person can do visualizations as if they already have the job, but on the mundane level they must prepare themselves to qualify for the job, make themselves \\"attractive\\" to a prospective employer, gain the knowledge that is necessary for the job, i.e the proper education. Then, armed with the tools needed for that particular job, coupled with the spiritual practices taught in \\"The Secret\\", one increases the probability of gaining the desired job. <br /> <br />I have been a Shamanic Pracitioner for over 20 years; I have utilized these methods, and they worked for me in every aspect of my life, be it my personal or business achievements. Praying is much the same thing; you must believe you will get what you pray for, but you must also work hard to achieve your goal. <br /> <br />

0140157352|5.0|Clearly this is a top notch book well worthwhile to be read by professional negotiators and also by the rest of us. It has a clear style. It is a short, entertaining and fast read, maybe a bit theoretical.  <br /> <br />The basic idea of this book is to find win-win scenarios that give both sides of the negations more than without a Harvard negotiation. Do not leave value on the table.  <br /> <br />Arguments against this method are dealt with in the last chapter. The authors always win (at least in this book). <br /> <br />I can recommend \\"Getting to Yes\\" to everyone living in our world. <br />
B00005JPLU|5.0|This movie was an amazing visual spectical with a very interesting way of using the narrative to flash back and forth from the stark reality of the battle field to the honor virtue and lore of the Spartan society and the resounding trembling of their glorious battle.  Meanwhile the coloring and texture of the film itself lends the story an amazing setting somewhere between a glorfied fantasy story of the 1940 film era and a modern kung fu action movie.  With hazy colouring, sepia tone, and freeze frame action sequences.    <br /> <br />This movie was a sheer delight filled with freaks, amazing fighting and tons of gorey bloodshed.  And to back up all those joys this movie also has amazing cinemetography and an interesting story line.  I would advise seeing this movie it is definetly one of the most enjoyable and fun films I have seen in a while.

0393327655|5.0|I believe it wasn't by mistake that you end up here checking out this book? Most likely you heard about it from a coworker, a fellow churchgoer, or your friend's mother (or wife) and most likely it went something like: \\"There is this fellow by the name of Sam Harris, who is trying to turn good and honest folks like yourself away from the truth...\\"<br /><br />We all know that similar conversations in the past stirred movements like the inquisition or the infamous witch hunts. So, let's just say these people were a little bit behind on their reading (they were behind on a lot more, but let's be polite)<br /><br />First and foremost, you need to proceed with a `very' open mind when reading this book. See, it's not that it will introduce something so incomprehensive or unreal that you'll need to reread each page...oh, no, on the contrary, it will make so much sense, that the abundance of it will cause you to cringe. And cringing you'll do until the last page.<br /><br />And why, you ask? Because it has been so damn long (nearly 2,000 years) since someone stood up on the fifty-foot pedestal flashing the bright light in the faces of the masses and then pointing to the common sense that had been crucified in exchange for a couple of table spoons of a sugary substance called faith.<br /><br />People, what went wrong? Was it our need to feel safe by disillusioning ourselves with beliefs in superstition and immortality? What else could it be? Deep down inside of us there is this basic need to be absolutely sure that the ego will stay alive forever. You know what I'm talking about. I am talking about the desire to persist for epochs. And what offers us this absolute guarantee? Yes, religion, you are catching on my dear reader. And what happens once we follow it? Slavery, torture, terrorism , death...stop me if it gets too monotonous.<br /><br />But you won't make sense of this review until you get your hands on a copy of this book. It will change your life.<br /><br />-by Simon Clevelandon Cleveland <br />

B00005JPLU|5.0|I saw this movie and plan to see it many more times before it's available to own which I will do also.  This is the type of movie that both male and female can enjoy.  It's just pure fun to watch and you cannot help but get into the characters and story.  It is very riveting and intense and the battle seens are outstanding.  The soldiers work together in the movie and perform like a well oiled machine and it's amazing to watch!  Even though it has some bloody parts, it's not the disturbing sick type of gore for the sake of gore.  Very classy!!  Gerard (Gerry) Butler is outstanding in this role and really gives a strong depth to King Leonidas that no one else could have pulled off.  All of the cast were outstanding!!

B000H305U0|4.0|um...this album is HOT. worth it for the songs Future Sex Love Sounds, Love Stoned, Sexyback and What goes around... I think Justin Timberlake is a cocky jerk and I wanted this album to blow. However, this is some of the best pop out there right now. I don't know whether to credit him or Timbaland, I mean this album sounds like Tim and the last album sounded like the Neptunes, which made it decent...Justin's only as good as his producers. For that reason, he will never be as big as Prince or Michael. but God, this is a good album! Recommended.

B000M4RG42|4.0|This movie was based upon a wonderfully patriotic concept...the raising of our flag and how this very action became a marketing tool even more important than the many men who sacrificed their lives.  Of course, it was all about raising $$$ to fund the big V.<br />As many others have pointed out, the problem with this movie is that it becomes somewhat confusing.  This is often the reason why I prefer unbiased documentaries over these historical dramas.  Out of respect for the men who fought at Iwo Jima, one should really do a bit of research and reading in order to give history the attention it deserves.  This film could have been much better, but unfortunately it requires some polish.

B00005JPLU|3.0|Before commenting on the merits and demerits of this film, I wish to say that I enjoyed the film and it kept my interest throughout.  However, this is a movie that is based on a comic book's view of the Persian War and the battle of Thermopylae, which means it has a few scattered historical facts surrounded by what appears to be much of Middle Earth.  In fact this film looks like an amalgam of the Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, and a (fill in the  blank) historical epic.  Because the film is actually about a three day battle it has very little plot - in fact no plot at all.  To compensate for this deficiency the screen writer threw in a whole subplot involving Theron and Gorgo back in Sparta.  Unfortunately there is little detail surrounding this sub-plot which really fails to add much to the movie other than duration.  In fact the film overall fails to provide background to any of the events, does not provide any character development, and really offers no motivations other than let's kill some Persians.<br /><br />If there was any doubt that this was a comic book in film, it was removed through the scale of some of the characters.  For instance we have an oversized wolf with yellow glowing eyes, which is not only oversized but has all of the earmarks of a Werewolf.  Then we have Elephants and Rhinos the size of houses.  Of course the actual Persians didn't use Elephants or Rhino's but then this is a comic book and the greatly enlarged scale adds to the drama.  The most glaring example of this scale manipulation was with the obligatory meeting between Leonidas and Xerxes where Xerxes is not only black (?) but approximately ten feet tall.  In fact the casting director for this film seemed to be confused about where Persia is because the Persians were mostly Negroes with more body piercings than your typical punk rocker and enough gold on them to make Mr T jealous.  The blood flows freely throughout the film with dismemberments and beheadings galore that are delivered with reckless abandon and in both glorious color and slow motion for the full effect.<br /><br />The costuming is really a mixed bag.  The Spartans wore jocks in the interest of modesty unlike the actual Spartans who wore nothing. The Immortals had wonderful silver masks, the Oracles were suitably diseased and evil, there were grotesque monsters that appeared to be left over from Lord of the Rings, and there were enough bare breasts to suit the masturbatory taste of the (largely male) audience.  Unfortunately while all of this added to the adventure the film its self failed to connect at any emotional level.  It is a comic book brought to life and beautifully done but it lacks even the emotional impact of Batman, Spiderman, or Superman.  Nevertheless the film does succeed artistically even if it lacks a plot.  There are many scenes which could never have been done in reality and could only have been done digitally and these truly are spectacular.<br /><br />I only gave this film three stars because it fails to develop any empathy or sympathy for any of the characters.  Nevertheless I enjoyed this film, it kept my interest from start to finish, and this is a film that I think most men will enjoy but it is definitely not a chick-flick or one for the squeamish.  It's a fun film filled with heroes and more than one message.  I liked it and if you are a guy I think you will like it as well but it is not the same quality as Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.vered with reckless abandon and in both glorious color and slow motion for the full effect.   <br /> <br />The costuming is really a mixed bag.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Final Fantasy VII was the very first Final Fantasy game I ever played, all the way back to when Squaresoft released an American demo disk for it. So, as it stands, FFVII has a very dear and special place in my heart, and I bought FFVII:AC on the day it came out. <br /> <br />I'm going to compare and contrast the two movies Square has made so far.  <br /> <br />I disliked Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within when it came out, as I think several fans did. It felt nothing like a Final Fantasy game. It was too sci-fi oriented and not the more traditional swords-and-sorcery I'd come to expect. But after watching it several times I realized that at its core, FF:SW is a movie, not a Final Fantasy game, and a pretty good one at that. Is has a good story, a great world, and decent characters, with enough Final Fantasy \\"in jokes\\" to put an extra smile on the faces of fans. <br /> <br />I liked Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, but only because I knew the characters and their backstories. In all honesty, FFVII:AC was an excuse to test the waters about making more stories based on FFVII. For years fans had been clammoring for a remake or sequal, and Square had been reluctant to give them one because they'd rather not risk ruining FFVII's legacy. FFVII:AC is really about having fun with the fans of the series, generating awesome battle sequences, and taking CGI animation in the opposite direction of, say, a Pixar film. <br /> <br />The plot of FFVII:AC is weak. There's no getting around that. The cause of Geostigma is hardly addressed, as are important topics to understanding it and the game world- such as the Lifestream. It's simply disappointing compared to the story of the game. Several characters I grew to know playing through the game get only brief cameos and around five lines apiece. And it's not that FFVII:AC is too short for it to have a proper storyline. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within clocks in at only five minutes longer, but is vastly superior as a well-developed story. Again, the focus of FF:AC was on having fun, and perhaps a deep and involved plot might have gotten in the way of that. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is a fast-paced action movie, with wonderful CGI animation and cool characters. If you're a fan of the series, buy it. If you're the friend or loved one of a fan, watch it. But if you're looking for something a little less passive and a little more engaging, check out Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|Okay, you all know this movie. You all know the story. And you all know how bizarre the film storyboards.<br /><br />A man time travels between insane asylum, past, and future...His sole purpose is to be the pawn used by a future society determined to allow a disease to descimate the planet, and ensure their power in the future.As with Gillam's film Brazil (brilliant), it is a statement about the rigid and inflexable structures of society.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, the best performance of three major stars.<br /><br />Bruce Willis-his first `bald' movie (ah...the hairline to come!) I am a huge Bruce fan. But this is really one of the best performances he has ever done. His emotions of confusion are honest. My honest opinion is this was better than any of his movies. He UNDERPLAYS his character perfectly.<br /><br />Terry Gillam director-Better than Brazil, which I thought was a brilliant film. His detail of time travel and lunacy is palatable. It FEELS real. His characters (like most of his films) are bombastic beyond real. I only wish he had been able to finish his version of Man Of La Mancha...<br /><br />Brad Pitt-This is the best I have ever seen of this pretty boy. His quirky near tourettes mannerisms are fantastic. Right down to the finger flicking/facial contortion and non-sequeteur dialogue. Way better than Fight Club. This is a personae he never played again. Too bad. He plays a fantastic lunatic better than he plays a spy, a hit man, or a romantic lead.<br /><br />I do not expect this to get votes. I just wanted to put in my 2 cents.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|Bringing It All Back Home, released in 1965, is Bob Dylan's first flirtation with electric rock/ blues.  Since the album is half electric and half acoustic, it is a perfect place for new fans of Dylan to start because they get a sample of both his electric rockstar side and his folk singer side.<br /><br />The album has quite a diverse selection of songs; fast, bluesy songs (\\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\"), slower, melodic love ballads (\\"She Belongs To Me\\", \\"Love Minus Zero/ No Limit\\"), poetic folk songs (\\"Mr.  Tambourine Man\\", \\"Gates Of Eden\\") and comedy (\\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\").  One of the best songs on the album is the surreal \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\".  This song always fills me with inspiration everytime I listen to it.<br /><br />This is a great album and a good place to start.
0618680004|5.0|Douglas Adams' fictional philosopher Oolon Colluphid wrote a book \\"Well That About Wraps It Up For God\\", an appropriate coincidence given Dawkins' regard for Adams. Dawkins pretty well wraps God up and throws him in the intellectual bin in this wide-ranging and tightly argued book. <br /> <br />Atheists will love this book. The devout will hate it and probably be unable to read it. It should be compulsory reading for anyone entering theological college: if you can't refute it to your satisfaction, you're in the wrong career. Anyone who has the intellectual curiosity and honesty to investigate the question of the existence of God should read it. As Dawkins himself notes, his book will not change the mind of anyone whose mind is made up. But as a resource for those still questioning, or with doubts they cannot articulate, The God Delusion is a must-read. I found it hard to put down. Dawkins' style is engaging and his arguments almost always surgically precise. <br /> <br />Of course Dawkins has brought the wrath of many down upon his head with this tome, including, sadly and disturbingly, some scientists. Oddly, while Dawkins pre-empts many of the expected criticisms and answers them in advance, I still see reviews in the printed press that make such arguments as if they hadn't been thought of. <br /> <br />In one part, Dawkins neatly turns the creationist argument from the \\"improbability\\" of evolution back on them, arguing that the required complexity of God proves he could not exist. Unfortunately this argument doesn't really prove the point, as believers do not think God came to be, they think he has existed eternally. But even then, the argument shows the emptiness of the residual \\"argument from design\\" that is left when science is shown to explain the origin of all structures and life in the universe: the \\"how come the laws of nature are such that this is possible?\\" Not only is explaining the laws of nature by reference to God a needless step in a sequence that has to stop somewhere (and why not stop at the known?), but the \\"explanation\\" is so vastly more complex than what it explains that it is not only unnecessary but a step backwards in more ways than one. <br /> <br />While Dawkins' science and philosophy of knowledge is excellent, the book could benefit from synthesis with a more fundamental reality- and reason-oriented philosophy such as Ayn Rand's Objectivism, as science is a branch of objective philosophy, not a stand-alone creation. That would tighten up the package, in some parts of the philosophy of knowledge and definitely on related philosophical questions such as ethics. But Dawkins is a scientist not a philosopher, and I can't condemn the excellent for not being perfect. <br /> <br />Bravo, Richard Dawkins. You have done the world a service with this book.

0743270754|4.0|In the presidential election of 1860 the newly minted Republican Party was fortunate to have four highly talented and dedicated men vying to carry the Republican banner. The men although a highly diverse quartet had two common characteristics: enormous egos; and the belief that only they could save the Republic from dissolution. The central theme of this book is how Abraham Lincoln not only won the Republican nomination and the subsequent national election, but how through shear force of his personality and brilliant understanding of men he was able to convince Chase, Seward, and Bates to join his administration and to serve it with enormous competence.<br /><br />Of the three, Salmon Chase, who was appointed Secretary of the Treasury, was the most difficult member of cabinet due to his unbridled ambition to be president and his near ego mania. Yet despite this, he served Lincoln loyally and well. Edward Bates, Lincoln's Attorney General, was probably the easiest of the group to deal with in that both his ambition and his ego were tempered by the love he had for his wife and family. William Seward named Secretary of State under went a fascinating transformation from high disdain of Lincoln to absolute devotion bordering on love for this unique President. In this book Kerns-Goodwin attempts to chronicle how Lincoln was able to effect the transformation of each of these men into loyal and effective members of a war cabinet.<br /><br />In the end she does not wholly succeed in this. The really fascinating part of this story is how Lincoln was able to weld his entire cabinet which, besides the three rivals, was filled with egotistical men into an effective and war winning team. The reader is given fragments of this story, but Kerns-Goodwin is a bit too prone to pursue side issues that have little to do with the cabinet. She also misses a golden opportunity to illuminate Lincoln's special gifts of persuading and leading men by not going more deeply into his troubled relationship with General George B. McClellan. Of all the men Lincoln encountered, McClellan was one of the few that appeared to be completely immune to Lincoln's powers of persuasion and unaware of his stellar intelligence. In historical analysis, like any other analysis, understanding the exceptions is the best way of understanding a general pattern.relationship with General George B. McClellan.

B00005JPLU|4.0|Plot Summary: In ancient Greece, the King of Sparta, defending the honor of his wife and his country, takes a ridiculously small army to battle against the overwhelming military power Persia.<br /><br />Reason for the Rating: Graphic battle sequences throughout, some sexuality and nudity.<br /><br />Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, 300 is an eye-popping film about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae in which a vastly outnumbered Spartan army of only 300 men took a heroic stand against the powerful invading force of millions of Persians, commanded by the supposed god-king, Xerxes.<br /><br />From the casting to the costuming and special effects, it's clear that the creators of this movie deliberately sought to draw the audience in and keep them riveted until the end, and at that mission they have succeeded. This is a supremely entertaining film.<br /><br />300 tells the story of Sparta's king, Leonidas (played by Gerard Butler), from the brutal training he received as a young boy, to the isolation he experienced as a youth in the wilderness fighting for his life, to his triumphant return to his home, his coronation as king, and subsequent battle against the Persians who sought to dominate his people.<br /><br />The standard sex and violence disclaimer applies for this movie. There's some nudity and sexuality, lots of blood, and a whole lot of death to contend with. It's a battle epic, one that vividly depicts the barbarity of life in times of ancient war, including stylized impalements and decapitations and more. This is not a film for children or for those whose sensibilities are easily offended - in fact, one of the producers of 300 insisted they were trying to make a \\"ballet of death\\" and Entertainment Weekly reported that computer special effects were used extensively to \\"create geysers of spurting blood worthy of Jackson Pollock.\\" So, parents, consider yourself warned. But also be aware that there is a message of truth woven into this story, for those intrepid enough to look.<br /><br />It would be easy to slide through this flick and be thoroughly entertained by the visual artistry alone, not giving the moral of the story one thought. Because of the producers' loyalty to the comic book format of Miller's original story, the special effects are captivating. There's a grainy, muted, silvery tone that gives the film an otherworldly feel that I couldn't take my eyes off of - and I didn't want to - even during the bloodiest battle scenes. The actors' skin seemed brushed with a preternatural glow. Outlandish creatures didn't seem so odd in this land, and even the ugly and disfigured seemed easy to behold. This didn't look like a comic book to me - it looked more like a beautifully painted work of art. No doubt about it: the creators of 300 deliberately crafted this movie as an impressive display of visual artistry, and they succeeding in that aim.<br /><br />But there is more here. This is a story about Leonidas: a man who, against all odds, grew up believing in the twin ideals of freedom and liberty; who, despite the abuse and violence he suffered as a child, would lay down his life for his country and fellow soldiers. A man who loves his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), so much that he would gladly spend his dying moments thinking of her. There is a portrait of good here - though granted it is a portrait that's a little fuzzy in places - such as when Leonidas kills one of Xerxes' messengers who comes to Sparta to demand surrender.<br /><br />However, in this film Leonidas doesn't submit to anyone - one of his strengths, but also one of his fatal flaws: he has no faith in, and perhaps not even any knowledge of, the God of Israel. Instead, he consults the pagan priests and an Oracle (played with sensual abandon by Kelly Craig) to determine the best course of action. When the Oracle tells Leonidas not to go into battle against the Persians, he defies the pagan priests and the Spartan council anyway. With hiswife's blessing, he rounds up 300 of the country's best soldiers to go with him to the \\"Hot Gates,\\" a narrow pass where Leonidas will lure the Persian troops and fight to the death for the liberty of his country.<br /><br />Xerxes (portrayed with a bisexual flair by Rodrigo Santoro) is a formidable picture of evil, a stark contrast to Leonidas' goodness and bravery. This evil king calls himself a god and the ruler of the entire earth, using biblical phrases of divinity to describe himself to anyone who would listen. His method of operation is to promise the world to those he would conquer, in words eerily similar to Satan in Scripture: bow down to me and I will give you power, fame, and wealth.<br /><br />But Leonidas, a real man's man, sees right through Xerxes' lies. The King of Sparta vows never to bow his knee to this enemy. He loves his wife, leads his soldiers, and doesn't shy away from even the gravest threat of danger. His life's example was a huge inspiration and influence to the nation of Greece.  However, back in Sparta, Queen Gorgo is lobbying for aid to her husband. In the process, she is deceived by the evil councilman Theron (Dominic West), who demands that she commit adultery with him in exchange for his help in convincing the rest of the Spartan council to listen to her. Because of her love for her husband, she makes an unwise decision that leads to death and betrayal.<br /><br />In all, I was very impressed by both the artistry and storytelling of 300. The only real drawback was the explicit sex and graphic violence spun throughout the film. Hollywood should know it is completely possible to make a hugely profitable, first-class battle epic movie without naked women and with understated violence. Yet, even so, I didn't find the R-rated elements of this movie to be as blatantly gratuitous as they are in many other movies; instead, they most often helped to expose the underlying motivations and mindsets of the characters involved.

B000BJS4BM|4.0|Madonna deserves a lot of credit for her resilience in the music industry and the ability to reinvent herself in a different style with this CD. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is saturated with synthesizer technology and pulsing beats; all you need is the disco ball and strobe lights in your living room.<br /><br />I have listened to this CD repeatedly and each time, the constant electronic groove is entrancing. The music by itself is worth a 5-star rating but some of the lyrics seem to possess a mundane prose. I mean, I wonder if Madonna actually sang these lyrics from \\"I Love New York\\" with a straight face:<br /><br />\\"I don't like cities but I like New York.<br />Other places make me feel like a dork\\".<br /><br />I know I laughed when I first heard it.

I think the purpose of this book is to help you realize this.  <br /> <br />There are frameworks for .NET that use the Domain Model and Data Mapper patterns, but you would never know this unless you were familiar with the patterns in this book. <br /> <br />For me, reading this book didn't allow me to write new code, but it did allow me to understand my choice to use a particular framework/technique over another.
1552091090|4.0|A story that holds it's own throughout generations.  It tells of a mother's love for her son, as he grows and changes.  A great reminder to all parents to cherish the time we have with our little ones.
1582701709|3.0|What is the reason you want this book?  If you are looking for a step by step plan - forget it.  If you want to read about some interesting people, then this is for you.  Sometimes it is just nice to get different perspectives on the same subject - of how did this person feel about it.  But this is NOT - HOW DID THEY DO IT!
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I am one who bought into all the hype that this is actually a good movie-it isn't. The acting seems robotic and I don't think the characters are supposed to be robots. (Heck, Lance Henrickson's character Bishop in the Alien movies has like double the personality of any of the characters in Serenity and Bishop is a robot.) I don't know if this is attributable to bad acting, bad directing, or both in Serenity.<br /><br />The whole movie plays like one of those bad Saturday afternoon movies that you start watching because nothing else is on, but then fall asleep to. I don't really have a problem with the way the actors look, the women (and maybe the men) look sexy. Also the visual effects are not bad. The story and premise is completely lacking. Why would the crew of Serenity continue to keep River on board once they know she is a weapon? They complain and whine to each other about it but never do anything about it-doesn't make any logical sense.<br /><br />Also the 2nd A.D. work in Serenity is really bad.
B00005JPAO|5.0|2006 will always be remembered as Helen Mirren's year. after years of being under the radar in great shows like Prime Suspect and movies like The Madness of King George and Gosford Park, Mirren finally roared onto the spot light not only playing one Queen Elizabeth but TWO Queen Elizabeths. first, she scored by playing the original Queen Elizabth in HBO's Elizabth 1 and then she scored again by playing Queen Elizabth 2 in this film, The Queen. the film follows the week after the terrible death of Princess Diana and the seemingly cold response the royal family gives to the death. through it all, Elizabeth 2 keeps her compsure not to buckle under the command while the Prime Minister grows restless over it all. some people have complained that the Queen is one big bore and i have to dissagree, i felt this movie was incredibally great and fully kept me engrossed in the picture. but the real reason i loved the film was Helen, she absolutly radiats as our conflicted queen, not only from the appearence but from her facial expressions, speech, and at just the right moment a bit of compassion. She definently deserved the Oscar, no doubt about it and hopefully now she will finally be reconized for her outstanding talent. to quote from Helen's Oscar speech \\"Ladies and gentlemen, i give you the queen!\\"
B00005JNS0|2.0|There is not a single person ever shown in \\"Cars\\". I don't think this is very realistic. In real life, you would see people walking around the streets, etc. After watching this DVD I left thinking \\"Where were the people\\"?
B00005JPLU|3.0|This is a rough rendering of the battle of Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans held off the Persian Army for 3 days at a narrow pass in northern Greece. I rated the movie a 3 to balance the weak story telling with the stunning visual display. I enjoyed the movie but found it to be highly fictional and it took many liberties with history. In some ways it reminded me of The return of the King with similar creatures and persian versions of trolls. Lots of guts, gore, and glory, graphic, but not grotesque. See it in the movies it will lose a lot on DVD
B00012QM8G|5.0|Despite being an avid viewer of quality movies, I have one habit that sometimes prevents me from seeing a movie when everyone else is.<br /><br />I don't like blood.<br /><br />Blood kept me from seeing most horror films, which doesn't bother me so much.  It kept me from seeing Pulp Fiction for six years, Reservoir Dogs for longer than that.  I still haven't seen Saving Private Ryan, and before yesterday, I still hadn't seen this film.<br /><br />In the afterglow of such a viewing experience I find it very difficult to give a review like I would a \\"normal\\" movie.<br /><br />Schindler's List is not a normal movie. It goes without saying that it is a very important movie.<br /><br />To take that thought a step further, there are two types of important movies. The first is a movie that is seminal in style and content, that defines a genre or phase in moviemaking; The Maltese Falcon for American Film Noir, Star Wars for the Epic Blockbuster, Nosferatu or perhaps Dracula for Horror, Metropolis or 2001: A Space Odyssey for Science Fiction, King Kong for Monster Movies, Singin' in the Rain for the Movie Musical, Birth of a Nation for silent films, The Godfather for Gangster dramas, and Citizen Kane for, well, for movies in general. These are important films for people to see who wish to understand film, entertainment, etc.<br /><br />Schindler's List is the other sort of \\"important.\\" It's not just important for people who appreciate film to see (although it is masterfully crafted, which I'll get into in a moment.) It is important for people who are human.<br /><br />Everyone who isn't a psycho-hatebag (i.e.: President Ahmadinejad) knows that the \\"Shoah\\" (lit. calamity) or \\"Holocaust\\" was possibly the most horrific event in human history, matched only rarely by the likes of Stalin and Pol Pot. Yet many people can only discuss this topic in the most basic terms. Six Million Jews, Adolf Hitler, Final Solution, Auschwitz, etc. How can any of us put a personal face on such an unimaginable tragedy? How can we ever get into the heart of the suffering and pain?<br /><br />Truth is we never can. But Director Steven Spielberg gets us as close as we can possibly hope to get.<br /><br />Spielberg shot the movie in black and white, a masterful choice that accomplishes two things. First, it sets the movie into the period. When we see black and white, we automatically are in the 40's. This is the color of our World War II footage, even of most of the still pictures we see. It places us in the moment.<br /><br />The second thing it does is make it watchable. If it had been in color, I wonder how many of us could have watched to the end. Spielberg doesn't go with the cutaways when innocent Jews are executed by a shot to the head at close range. He shows it to you. I have seen one video of a man shot in the head in my lifetime. I wish I'd never seen it, but there was no difference, other than the color, to this.<br /><br />In any other movie, it would have been gratuitous. But this is what the Jews saw as they went about their daily life.  Spielberg lets you see a life of horror through their eyes.<br /><br />In one scene an old one-armed man who had been protected by Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), Oskar Schindler's (Liam Neeson) Jewish plant manager, is caught on the way to the factory when the group of workers is forced to shovel snow to clear the road for German vehicles. He is taken aside and executed summarily. Graphically.<br /><br />Yet the true horror of the scene was the mother and child nearby. As the man is dragged aside, the mother urges her child, \\"Look at the snow, look at the snow, the snow!\\" The child looks down (though we don't.) There is a crack of a handgun and the man goes down, his blood soaking the snow, but the rest keep shoveling, hoping to just survive the moment. Looking at the snow.<br /><br />Spielberg demonstrated in this movie not only that he can make a movie look good, but that he can make a movie of power and truth.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes plays the sadistic Amon Goeth, the German officer in command of the labor camp supplying Schindler's factory with labor. To say this man was murderous would be an understatement. Yet even here Spielberg manages to show the conflicted humanity of the man. His inner conflict concerning his Jewish Maid Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz) is subtle and heartbreaking, as you tug on him with your own mind to find his humanity somewhere within.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern is, well, Kingsley. He is quite possibly the most skilled and adaptable actor in the world, despite not being the first name to come to mind when you think of great modern actors. Disclaimer: I'm a big fan. He plays Stern with stark honesty. Stern is very realistic, and does not expect to live out the war. He is fatalistic and insecure, and Schindler spends as much time saving Stern from himself as from the Nazis.<br /><br />But the star is the star, right? Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is a masterwork, a lifetime achievement. His collaboration on this part with Spielberg (and writer Steven Zaillan) brings out Oskar Schindler as a tangible, three-dimensional person. Schindler is the stuff real heroes are made of, though he eschewed the moniker all his life. Movie heroes are idealistic, other-motivated, sacrificial from birth caricatures. Schindler is a selfish, womanizing, profiteering opportunist who finds he cares about these people he first employs as slaves. In the beginning this practice of protecting seemed to be instigated by Stern, with Schindler purposely turning a blind eye, but there was in him a sense of humanity that could not buy into the Nazi propaganda regarding the so-called inhumanity of Jews. Neeson portrays the gradual, stilted journey from self-service to self-sacrifice with marvelous aplomb.<br /><br />This film is full of moments, moments that make you cry with horror and make you cry with quiet, joyful hope.<br /><br />But nothing can prepare you for what happens at the end. If you have never seen this movie, you will find yourself moved to the depths of your being if you have any soul at all.  I will not give it away for the few that may  not have seen it yet.<br /><br />It is almost moot to give this movie a rating. Five Stars, Five anythings makes no sense. This is one of the most important films ever made, and should be required viewing for those who are committed to facing the evil in our world that still perpetrates killing, in Darfur, in Rwanda, wherever it may happen.<br /><br />I only regret having waited so long and for so silly a reason.vie of power and truth. <br /> <br />Ralph Fiennes plays the sadistic Amon Goeth, the German officer in command of the labor camp supplying Schindler's factory with labor.

B000002AHC|5.0|though mr tambourine man, younger than yesterday, and sweetheart of the rodeo are usually regarded as the best byrds albums, it is the notorious byrd brothers that i find myself returning to most often. i never tire of this great album. it's spacey psychedelicism is mesmerizing. the songs abound with wonderful floating melodies and stunning harmonics. horn and string arrangements are added to the byrd arsenal of sound here, and the rythmic shifts, abrupt tempo-changes, and various psych touches leave one wondering what sonic surprise might happen next. two slow numbers, \\"goin' back,\\" and \\"draft morning,\\" are particularly gorgeous, while \\"old john robertson\\" and \\"change is now\\" foreshadow the country leanings their music would later acquire. this is a great album, beginning to end. the bonus tracks on the cd do not, however, add anything worthy of the original recording, and would have been best left off. anyway, the remastered version from 1997 (which contains the six bonus tracks) is a big improvement in sound over the first cd version, so if you get this, make sure you get the '97 remastered disc.
B00004Z3AV|4.0|I think it is great when bands like Queen, ELO, Styx, and Yes have clear influences from classical music.<br /><br />Queen is a very versatile band.  My favorite tracks are \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" (original), \\"You're My Best Friend\\" (my all time favorite love song), and \\"Somebody To Love\\" (original).
B0000024ZT|4.0|preceding, as it did, his worldwide fame, and a string of classic albums, this album tends to get shortchanged in the history of rock and roll. no, it is not a match for such masterworks as \\"the wild, the innocent, & the e street shuffle,\\" \\"born to run,\\" \\"darkness on the edge of town,\\" \\"nebraska,\\" or \\"we shall overcome: the seeger sessions,\\" but this is an outstanding debut nonetheless. sure, it is a bit verbose, and, yes, perhaps he did dip into a rhyming dictionary a tad to freely, but all in all this is a very fine set of songs. the exuburance of \\"blinded by the light\\" is pure joy, while \\"growin' up\\" is a classic song that stands with the best of springsteen's songs. \\"lost in the flood,\\" \\"for you,\\" \\"spirit in the night,\\" and \\"it's hard to be a saint in the city\\" are all fantastic. listen, and if you disagree: try to write a song of your own, and see if you can better these. also of note, the quiet ballad \\"the angel,\\" which has an appearance by the great acoustic bass player, richard davis (who performed such timeless musical magic on van morrison's \\"astral weeks\\" album). give this album a break, it is not springsteen's best, but it's excellent all the same.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is, without any doubt, one of Barbra Streisand's best movies ever in her career as a singer and actress. She does an excellent job with her role in this movie. Kris Kristofferson is great as well. I'm not very familiar with any of his work before or after this movie, but he did fine. The songs in the movie are especially remarkable. The most well known song in this movie has got to be Evergreen, which is one of my most favorite Barbra Streisand songs ever. I also have the soundtrack album of this movie, and it is fun to listen to. I'm so pleased that this movie has finally been released on DVD so that fans who first saw it in the cinema back in 1976 will be able to enjoy it in digital form more than 30 years later. The chemistry between Barbra and Kris is great; they did a great job together. My mother first saw this movie when it was in the cinema back in '76 and she too had the album on LP (which she doesn't have anymore due to it being broken). The video and audio transfer was really crisp, clear and fresh sounding. The additional features were great as well; those being the deleted scenes, wardrobe tests (the outfit Barbra had on that looked like a tuxedo was kind of crazy looking), and the trailer gallery for all three versions of A Star is Born (I didn't really pay too much attention to the first two trailers, so I just bolted on to the trailer for this '76 flick), and you also get commentary by Barbra herself. I watched this movie in full with her commentary, and she did an excellent job with her narration about how this movie was done, how certain scenes were shot, etc. When watching this movie with her commentary, you almost get the feeling that you and her are watching this movie together, and that she is really talking to you in person and telling you about this movie. That is totally excellent. Way to go, Barbra!!! Get this movie and add it to your movie library, and be sure to get the soundtrack album so that that can be added to your Barbra Streisand music library, as well! <br />My grade for <br />the movie: A <br />Additional scenes: A <br />Barbra's commentary: A <br />5.1 Dolby Digital sound: A
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|this is my 2nd favorite paul simon album (\\"there goes rhymin' simon\\" comes in 1st), and a particularly special recording to me, in that it introduced me to the wonders of african music and musicians. since first hearing this i have acquired over a hundred african albums, and discovered such masterful musicians as king sunny ade, manu dibango, fela kuti, ali farka toure, boubacar traore, baaba maal, amadou & miriam, orchestra baobab, and on and on. paul simon's achievement on \\"graceland\\" is a spectacular blending of american and african musicians on a joyous set of songs. the whole thing works perfectly and is a recording all music collections should have.
1582701709|1.0|There was one major thing I disliked about the book and one major thing I liked about it. <br />The thing I disliked was that it was clearly wrong.  People have unexpected things happen to them all the time.  If what we thought about was always what happened, every prediction anybody made (which is necessarily based on their thoughts and feelings) would be correct.  People who worry too much would live horrible lives filled with strife and optimists would live carefree lives and be successful in everything they did.  The fact that this is not the case should be evident by anybody who has ever taken the trouble to examine their own or anyone else's lives.  The book starts with an extravagant claim (the Universe is like a genie; everything you think about will happen, no matter what it is) and shrinks it down considerably (in order to make something actually happen you have to make believe that it already has happened, getting in the correct frame of mind over time).  It promotes an ideology of passiveness and laziness; if things naturally just come to me whenever I think about them, what is the point of working hard for them?  Of earning them?  One doesn't need to deserve thing, all you need is to believe you have it and there you are.  I will concede that a person might, through concerted mental effort, delude himself into believing that he has effortlessly manifested a car in his driveway, and I will make the more reasonable suggestion that a person could work towards getting a car and will be more motivated to do so if he's thinking about how much he wants it and how cool it will be to have it.  Positive thinking is not useless.  However, the notion that things will come about just because you think about them is just plain wrong. <br /> <br />The good thing about the book is that the claims it makes are easily disproven.  Here you go: <br />Step 1:  Find someone who believes in the Secret. <br />Step 2:  Have them use the Secret method of Ask, Believe, and Recieve to attract the experience of flipping a coin twenty times and having it land with Heads face up every time they flip it.  Give them as much time as they need to get into this frame of mind. <br />Step 3:  Give them a quarter and have them flip it twenty times.  Write down which side comes up each time they flip it.  If the Secret works, it will come up Heads every time. <br /> <br />This can be tried by yourself, with the potential confound that you yourself have to be experiencing some kind of doubt in order to critically examine the belief.  Basically, this means that you can safely assume that anyone who believes in the Law of Attraction (as it is described in this book, anyway) haven't actually tried it.  Remember, isolated incidents don't count because it's supposed to be an omnipresent \\"law of the universe, like the law of gravity.\\"
B00005JP97|1.0|First of all, this is an opinion, and we all know what opinions are like. Secondly, with a do respect, I don't share the same conclusion, nor do I see what the other viewers saw, but what I saw was an absolute mess. This movie is not good. Don't get me wrong, I like Christina Ricci. I think most of her movies push the envelope, and she made me fan for life with her role in \\"Monster\\". The same goes for Sam Jackson. Sam is just Sam, what else can I say, but he always brings it. However, neither one of them could save this movie. Even Justin Timberlake's performance was much better than expected, but he couldn't save this either. I think this is a film where the writing just sucks with a capital S. Forgive me, but I wasn't impressed in the least by seeing a movie about a woman in the South sleeping with any and everything with a heartbeat. Is the the best they could do? For real, this movie isn't realistic at all. Not to mention, this movie gets so boring so fast that it'll make your head spin. By the end, I didn't care what happened I just wanted it to be over. Believe me, I really tried to give it a fair chance and make myself finish this movie, but I just didn't like it at all. Christina Ricci plays Rae, a woman with an extreme sexual addiction. It's not surprising at all that this behavior is a result of molestation. Anyway, Rae sleeps around with everyone in town, and everybody knows it. Sam Jackson plays Lazarus, a man who's wife has left him for his younger brother. One night, after Rae has had another one of her sexual encounters and is left in the middle of nowhere practically naked, her boyfriend's friend picks her up. After she comes on to him, he beats her down, and thinking that's he's killed her, he pushes her out of the front seat of his car and leaves her for dead. Lazarus finds her and nurses her back to health so to speak. It's during this time that he's realized that his purpose in life is to help this lost soul. Rae wakes up bound by huge chains around her waiste, so she can't leave and give in to her sexual desires any longer. This is Laz's way of ridding her of the inner demons that make her do these things. Anyway, that's about it, end of story. What was good about that? I still wanna know.
B00005JPLU|5.0|I believe \\"300\\" to be one of the best action movies I have seen in some time.  It was great!!!!!  I was caught up in the story of duty and preservation of the society.  The battle scenes were top notch.  This was an amazing movie with visual delights galore. <br /> <br />

B000006NPY|5.0|I originally bought this album when it was released because of \\"Ava Adore,\\" but I hated the rest of it... at least I thought I did. A couple of years ago, following a trip down splitsville, it caught my eye while I was unpacking boxes in my new place. If you've ever gone through that period of \\"I need something unfamiliar, something detached, just some background noise, to get through this\\" after the rage has subsided and silence is entirely too overwhelming, you can relate. Anyway, \\"Adore\\" went into my player and within the first \\"re-listen\\" I felt like I had uncovered lost treasure. From the techno-infused \\"Pug\\" and \\"Appels + Oranjes\\" to the sorrowful, yet amazingly beautiful, \\"Crestfallen\\" and \\"Blank Page\\" (my favorites), this album left me feeling somewhat ashamed... and definitely shocked. And even today, I can't quite comprehend why I tossed it aside 7 years ago but now regard it as one of my favorite albums ever. Maybe I hadn't suffered enough at 23 and needed a more mature perspective... maybe the sorrow I felt two years ago found a friend in the misery of \\"Adore.\\" Whatever the reason, \\"Adore\\" was there during a difficult and defining period of my life... and I couldn't be more thankful for this incredible piece of work. Like many others have suggested, I strongly recommend you give it another try. Hang new curtains, bob your head to the upbeats, cry on downslide, and sleep among the stars.

0446528056|5.0|I've read virtually all of Nicholas Sparks books except one and yes most of them have ended on shall I say a bitter/sweet note. This one does not fail at this. But alas, this is his trademark, his signature way of drawing us into the story line and filling us with wonder, thoughts of love and intrigue, highs and yes, sometimes the lowest of lowes. I enjoyed this book and at times couldn't put it down. Does it fulfill you and yet leave you feeling depressed over the complexity of the turmoils of love's mysteries and pitfalls. Yes. But this is life, this is what we're all subject too in varing degrees. Life is a sort of love story, a learning experience of values, and sacrificies for the ones that you love and cherish and the extent to what you will do for them. This story has all of that and more. It teaches us all something if we will just take the time to understand what Nicholas is trying to tell us in his God given ability. Some thought that the book was boring, or typecast of some of his other books, but what are we looking for out of life? Read the book for the experience of what two people learned from their encounter with each other and read in amazement at how they dealt with the outcome. I learned from it and can only hope that my book (its not published yet) can only be half as touching as this one.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|At times reminiscent of Ray Charles vocal smokiness, at others his own gentle self. An excellent sophomore disc. Higly recommended if you enjoy great songs well written and well performed.
B000IOM0WO|5.0|The film is grainy and not a particular improvement over the dvd version, but the real prize here is the sound.  The DTS 6.1 is incredible.  You really feel like you are part of the audience of the shows clipped here.  YOu feel as though you are in the warehouse for \\"Desire\\" and in the church for \\"I Still haven't found what I'm looking for. When the film switches from the grainy black and white to the color for \\"where the Streets Have no name,\\" the picture quality matches the impeccable soundtrack.  This is a must own for any U2 fan.
0783225857|5.0|Classic stuff and worth having in any home library.   One criticism; the cover shows the film in color, but it is really black and white (as it should be).
1582701709|5.0|This book and video has opened my eyes to a new side of life I have always wondered about.  I am thrilled to be learning the secret.

Thank you Ms. Bryne for enriching my life.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|I got this movie orginally to see Vincent Gallo's schlong and that I did. That is why I did give this movie 2 stars. The story of this movie is very boring and it is a very dull movie all in all. The dialong is awful and it's actors are boring as well. I am sorry, but I will have to say don't even bother with this movie unless you want to see Vincent Gallo or Chloë Sevigny nude. Other than that, don't bother.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I just wanted to say that I am a Rocky fan from the beginning and have been deeply touched by the \\"Rocky\\" saga. Rocky has always been first out of my mouth when asked about my favorite movies. I loved the way Stalone \\"Bowed out\\" Rocky in \\"Rocky Balboa\\". Sly kind of left Rocky defeated in \\"Rock V\\". And even though Rocky Lost the fight in \\"Rocky Balboa\\" - technically. \\"Rocky\\" The series \\"bowed out\\" triumphantly. I love Rocky Balboa. I started weeping almost from the opening \\"curtain\\". For me the farewell at the end when Rocky turned and waved to the crowd at the statium, He was saying good bye to all of us. ( I am choking back even while I write this). I know Stalone took a lot of creative license in all of the series ( frankly I think He does so in all of his works, most of which I love as well - Although I can't imagine how Sly could possible \\"Bow out\\" Rambo, Maybe give \\"him\\" a seat in the US congress), But I find some strange ability in my heart to look past that when it comes to Rocky ( and Rambo), where as most of the time I am unable to do so with most other artistic expression.  I tell people that While there is boxing in the movies the series really isn't about boxing... They all think I'm crazy. To me Rocky is first of all, a love story, And about overcoming overwhelming odds. It's about the fight all of us wage with our inner self. And rising to the occassion dispite the odds. I would also like to thank Stalone for the triumphant exit of our beloved ROCKY! ( \\"Rocky\\" is a fictional story and while I love the \\"Story \\" deeply... It in no way has any merit when it comes to the Love and Faith I have in My Lord, Savior and Friend Jesus Christ, Who is God over all. From whom ALL things have their existance. - All Inclusive Bible Believing Me :)

It truly takes concentration to follow the vast descriptions of characters and places.  But it's certainly worth the time.  The author paints a horrific picture of what happens when a child's fantasy world bleeds into reality and leads to decisions that have tremendous consequences.  My only critique is that the last 1/4th of the book skips quickly from life phase to life phase and then claims not to have told the entire truth.
0786890754|5.0|Great book - Ceclia Ahern is an excellent author.  Received in good condition.
B00005JPLU|4.0|My wife and I have been anticipating this movie for so long - and we were not disappointed! Except that it was too short, perhaps. <br /> <br />Visual stunning. Viscerally engaging. 300 puts you right there into combat, as well as a dream world type Sparta. Truly one of a kind, breakthrough film. Saw it twice, in fact. <br /> <br />Man, it is gonna look better on DVD on my 65-inch HD television! <br /> <br />Gerrard Butler did an outstanding job. He really stood out and stole the bloody movie! But everyone that was cast in their parts did a fantastic job. <br /> <br />But Leonidus stands supreme! Hated to see him go... <br /> <br />Zach Snyder did a superb job here. His remake of Dawn of the Dead blows away anything George Romero did, hands down.  <br /> <br />This movie will surely catapult him to top director status. Can't wait to see how he intends to top this film.
0312983867|5.0|I have read all of Janet Evanovitch's novels about Stephanie Plum and they are always funny and great!

B000000OF6|5.0|Waht beautiful classics, especially Bohemian Rhapsody.  I will treasure it for a long time.
B00005JPLU|5.0|Not a historically correct portrayal of the Spartan war against the Persian empire, but a visual treat for those who love the lore, gore and mythical aspects of Greek history.  A fantastic feast for the eyes - it was filmed entirely against blue and green screens at high speed.  The movie has a grimy, greasy, \\"sweaty\\" quality - it even looks like a vintage, tinted film at times.  The effect is jaw-dropping and creates magnificent, surreal battles, humans, and \\"creatures\\".  Spartan warriors appear as 8-foot tall mythical men (Apparently due to a six-week intense training period before filming) ...not even Sin City comes close to this kind of original depth in film.   Every minute is filled with tension and excitement and most should be credited to Gerard Butler whose appearance and ferociousness as Leonidas, the Spartan king actually make us believe the few 300 Spartan soldiers may have stood some chance at glory - he is indeed mammoth and engaging- his voice alone is carries the weight of a charging army and he has the charisma of a rock star on screen (as he has been in life). <br />In my opinion, 300 is more engaging than Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, or Alexander the Great.  While there is no surprise story to most who have any knowledge of Greek history, its visual treatment of the Battle of Thermopylae will surely become legendary.  Graphically, 300 is sure to set the bar unbearably high for future action films to follow. <br />On a side note, it should be interesting to see how the American public reacts to a film heralding \\"retreat\\" as a fate worse than death-as we are a sensitive audience in the middle of a war.   <br />My vote-see it in the theater and own it on DVD for a lifetime-its the best action film I have seen in years. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Bought it for my mother who of course loves it. Are any of them single? LOL ;)
B000002GVO|5.0|Time has passed Bachman Turner Overdrive, Ted Nugent and thankfully, The Hansens by, for reasons that only the gods and Robert Hilburn know. Bands may have their peak, but they don't often stay at the summit for decades to haunt the listener with a new nuance or an unheard overtone or a lyric that takes on new meaning or a vocal that pulls a tear when years before it generated a giggle. Time proves the mettle of the band in the maelstrom of public opinion and in the pop culture mindset of society.<br /><br />A review of Hotel California in the classic sense of a track-by-track critique is folly. It's like going to the symphony to discover that Mahler should be capable of more subtlety, or to take issue with the color of the Golden Gate Bridge. The CD (or the \\"album\\" as we remember it) is now a part of us. To take it down to its component parts is like pulling the cornerstone from the Chrysler Building out for inspection. Pick it apart all you like, but there's no replacing a masterpiece of memory. It's not going anywhere. It's the Petrified Forest of rock.<br /><br />Great music, music that transcends, that transports, is for all time, and messing with the components risks an awakening of evil spirits, a cacophonous clash of cultural traps, a probable trip to the edge of the abyss. DON'T GO THERE. The Eagles are as they were, an aural collection, and recollection for the ages.

0743496728|4.0|Nineteen Minutes is the tragic story of Josie and Peter, two best friends that grow apart due to popularity.  From their seperation as friends on, each grow further and futher apart until one day they end up back together - laying on the ground of the locker room after Peter has gone on a rampage, shooting up the school and killing many of his classmates.  What could drive someone to this point?  This novel gets inside the minds of not only the loser of the school, Peter but the winner as well, Josie to see both sides of the popularity game in High School.  This novel bounces between what led to such a tragedy and the present time, placing the framework of what if turning into what was.<br /><br />This novel is well written and fast paced enough to keep somone turning from page to page.  The only issues I have with the novel is some unsolved mysteries and the last chapter could have been a bit more filled out.  All in all though it is a solid book that is a good read.
B00003CXAE|5.0|One of the best musical comedies ever. The music and dancing are fabulous. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John have great chemistry. The final number performed at the carnival is most entertaining and will have the viewer humming this tune way after the movie is over. Baby boomers will especially relate to this film.
B000H30B2C|5.0|Great flic.  Special effects rule. Acting so-so.  Jack Black seems miscast in his part.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Hands down, the best movie of 2006.  Director  Martin Scorsese has created a masterpiece. Filming, script and atmosphere are all top notch. The acting of the large ensemble cast is first rate, especially Leonardo DeCaprio who gives the best performance of his career thus far. This 2-disc Special Edition couldn't be better.
B000ERU5EK|4.0|Oh my god, this cd is simply awesome. It is relaxing and upbeat at the same time. I can play it in the car on my way to work when I'm stuck in traffic, or at home at night when I dim the lights, it fits both environments. My best songs are mostly the vocal ones.  <br /> <br />Stealing Time- I can relate to the songs lyrics  <br />Can't Sleep- Very etheral vocals, heavenly! <br />Hope, and Liquid Love- nice instrumentals, flows well with Can't sleep <br />Alone Tonight- clever lyrics in this song <br /> <br />Overall the album is great and is one of the most unique CD's in my collection.
074356619X|5.0|Excellent product, excellent service.  Everyone should own this CD set... Thank You :-)
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The first time I listened to this album I fell in love with it (and Amy) <br />These guy's put a lot of effort into this piece of art and it flows seamlessly. Kudos guys, I'd give you ten stars if I could.
074356619X|5.0|Just what I needed - this is not really a new theory - but it was well worth it.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Until I looked a bit deeper, I feared I was the only person who thought \\"Octavarium\\" to be a rather boring amalgam of layered formula. Whatever inspiration spawned this recording, it must have been smothered under the huge, droning wall of sound that envelops the songs.<br /><br />Yes, Dream Theater produced an engineering masterpiece, played flawlessly, and conjured up a slick, scripted package--but the whole effect seems robotic and lifeless. A dose of edginess might have infused some urgency and energy into this session.
1582701709|5.0|I purchased this book and also in DVD form. It is an amazing help for the self, especially when the spirit of a person is down and out. I have put many of the \\"secrets\\" into action and I have seen a drastic change in my world. I highly recommend this item!!
B000LC4ZHG|5.0|My only major beef I had with this movie was the way it was marketed. Thanks to the trailers and previews to the film, we knew that Chuck Noland would in fact be rescued from the island. However, even with that said, the previews didnt really spoil the movie. Though it would have made the message(s) that much more powerful if they didnt give that much of it away.  Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland; A FedEx efficiency engineer who flies around the world at a moments notice to troubleshoot whatever problems the company is having at any given place. Helen Hunt plays his loving girlfriend / fiance, Kelly, who is very understanding of Chuck Noland's plight.  One day, just before Christmas, Chuck is called away to Malaysia. This is when Chuck Noland's life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane (most realistically) crashes into the ocean. As the only survivor, he washes up on shore of a small, isolated island in the south Pacific.  This is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character. On the surface, Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to; He has a high paying job which he actually seems to enjoy on some level, and a girlfriend he is completely in love with. His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash. Now his life is turned upside down as he struggles to find the basic needs of survival. There are no cuts to the rescue efforts, no \\"meanwhile, back in Memphis\\" scenes. It's all Chuck on the island for the second act of the film.  There are four basic needs of survival. Most people know about the first three: Food, Water and Shelter. Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need, which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls \\"Wilson\\".  The aquisition of food, water and shelter are all epic struggles for Chuck Noland as we see him try to break open coconuts with rocks and make fire to cook crabs. We suffer with him as he does his own dental work. This goes on for four years...  Finally, one day a piece of metal (from the plane?) washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape. He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island. He spends several days out on the ocean hoping to be rescued. Along the way, he losses his only friend of the last four years, Wilson, in a strange but very emotional scene. Shortly thereafter, on the brink of death from dehydration, he is rescued.  In any other movie, this would be the happy ending. But this is not any other movie. Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life. And now he must find a way to move on with his.  When he first arrived on the island, he only needed to find ways to physically survive, but now rescued, he needed to find ways how to emotionally survive in a world that moved on without him.  The final scene, just before the credits roll, reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie. This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering, pain, or tragedy that someone may go through, their life will always be worth living. And it does so without invoking religion or astrology or any other kind of pseudoscience. This is a moral and spritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|Norah Jone's new album, Not Too late, is wonderful. I highly recommend it.
B00005JPLU|5.0|Not being familiar with the Frank Miller \\"graphic novel\\" (which is really a fancy term for \\"expensive comic book\\"), I approached this story with a clean slate and an open mind. I had nothing to compare it to and I had no expectations...other than, hopefully, I hadn't wasted $5 on a matinée. <br /> <br />I am impressed and awed. This movie managed to cover all the bases: storytelling, atmosphere, special effects, violence, greed, betrayal, love, sex and enough man-candy to fuel many masturbatory fantasies for both men and women alike. Six-pack abs and leather jocks abound, amongst other things. To say that this movie is \\"gay\\" is definitely not an insult...a gay sensibility runs throughout, from costume design to sly cultural Greek references to each and every frame that brims with details and textures. This is one gorgeous movie! <br /> <br />However, don't be fooled...this is also one heck of an ultra-violent flick. It is, after all, a battle story. But this is not sadistic \\"Saw\\"-type violence; rather, it is presented in a mythical and, dare I even say it this way, poetic fashion. Full-out war has never been this lyrical! The action scenes are intense and beautiful. Many are rendered in slow-motion and one can fully appreciate the quasi-ballet that unfolds. This is comic book art come to life: the intense stares, the posturing, the clever funny quips, the flowing capes, the blood that splatters in gobs (the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" video game of the early 90's was apparently more influential than previously thought), the severed heads that quietly slip off torsos, the behemoth creatures, the grotesque characters and the decadent opulence of the enemy.  <br /> <br />This is one film that would not have disappointed me even if I had paid full price. Granted this will probably not have terrific audiences because it is so graphic and it does originate from a comic book (\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" undoubtedly still lingers in many moviegoers' minds, I'm sure). But I envision a rabidand devout cult following for this one. I can't say I'll be one of them but I'll certainly do my share: the DVD will be purchased when it's released. <br /> <br />

B000LC55F2|4.0|\\"The Prestige\\" features an outstanding cast, a topic seemingly tailor-made for the special effects possible in the movies, and a promising storyline, and delivers a thrilling and highly watchable movie.<br /><br />The movie is the story of a rivalry between 19th century magicians played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, both apprentices of the elder magician played by Michael Caine, made deadly enemies by a fatal accident during the performance of a trick. Their rivalry leads them to plot against each other. The effect is a twisting storyline, which, confusingly, is told in a herky-jerky manner alternating between several pasts and an uncertain present. Some of the more clever plot twists, including the most important one, are obscured by the time changes. At the conclusion of the film, even attentive viewers may be scratching their heads as to exactly who did what to whom and when.<br /><br />The movie is richly authentic in period detail and in the mechanics of the magician's trade. Michael Caine does fabulous work as a connecting thread in the story, providing the necessary explanation for some key scenes. David Bowie has a nice cameo as a scientist. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman nicely portray their respective social class differences.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining story, especially for those with an interest in magic.

B0001US8FI|5.0|Long-time fans of Bruce Lee are well-aware of this two-disc DVD set, which captures Bruce Lee's restored \\"Enter The Dragon\\" along with an interesting collection of extra featurettes.  For those who are not long-time Bruce Lee fans, \\"Enter The Dragon\\" was his first movie made to Hollywood production standards, and unfortunately his last (he died unexpectedly just prior to the release of the movie).<br /><br />The storyline, featuring Lee infiltrating a martial arts tournament sponsored by a Chinese criminal warlord in Hong Kong, is pulp fiction at its best.  It provides a series of opportunities for fights, with short intervals of expository dialogue.  The characters are lightly drawn from popular fiction and stereotypes; only the handful of lead characters get any real development as people.<br /><br />The real draw of the movie when it was released in 1971 were the dramatic martial arts action sequences. Lee choreographed the fight scenes, which feature himself and a number of other experienced martial artists, along with \\"real\\" actor John Saxon (who had enough martial arts training to look respectable in his fights).  This movie spawned several generations of martial arts movies in Hollywood, but none have ever quite surpassed the performances in \\"Enter The Dragon\\", which rely on no special effects other than the rare use of slow-motion.<br /><br />The director and producer's voice-over commentary is worth listening to; \\"Enter The Dragon\\" was accomplished on something of a shoe-string with respect to production in Hong Kong.  Several of the supporting actors were literally walk-ons or support personnel asked to play a role. This reviewer was surprised to find out that the principal villian did not speak English and literally phonetically memorized and delivered whole chunks of menancing dialogue.<br /><br />This DVD set is highly recommended to fans of Bruce Lee and to those looking for an excellent introduction to the genre of martial arts movies.
B000EYK4KI|3.0|A good action film. Great fight between the two. On the whole average.

020530902X|5.0|I've always loved our language. I'm creative enough, yet since the 7th grade even though I've always scored A's in my English classes, I've been plagued with an inability to make my writing clean and readable. After I learned Russian I lost my feel for English altogether; words loitered haplessly between thoughts. Redundance, ambiguity and lack of direction sapped any life from my pen, so I decided upon desparate measures. To my pleasant surprise, I was enraptured by this book the instant I opened it. It is the first manual I've seen that is in itself a work of art. I've learned even more by example than I have by the explanations.<br /><br />On my honeymoon my wife was sick and as I took care of her I pulled this book from my suitcase and began reading. Quickly the expression of intrigue and fascination, usually reserved for my face as I'm enjoying a  remarkably complex chess game, the light of true committment and love filled my eyes. When Natasha woke up to ask for some juice, she found what I was reading and the enthusiasm with which I read, so distraught was she  that it took a full 2 days for her to forgive me. She even pulled herself out of bed the next time she wanted a drink just to avoid seeing how I poured over each page.<br /><br />The next best book I've seen takes about 2 1/2 times as many pages to say basically the same thing, never with as much force, skill or clarity. Anyone who values his English should own this book. Every student should keep a copy in his back pocket.
B000784WMW|2.0|I was very disappointed in this version.  I think the acting is so terrible that I never finished the movie.  It was boring  I prefer the Masterpiece Theatre version.

0802130208|5.0|Born in New Orleans in 1937, John Kennedy Toole earned degrees at Tulane and Columbia Universities and was pursuing a teaching career when drafted in 1961.  He thereafter returned to New Orleans, where he wrote the novel A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES.  Although the novel received initial interest from the publishing industry, it was ultimately rejected--and the failure of the book fueled Toole's depression.  Toole committeed suicide in 1969, leaving the unpublished manuscript in his mother's New Orleans home.  When she discovered it, Thelma Toole began a campaign on behalf of the novel that resulted in a 1980 publication.  Instantly hailed by critics, it won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize, has sold millions of copies, and is generally considered one of the great comic masterpieces of the 20th Century.<br /><br />DUNCES focuses on the life of Ignatius J. Reilly, a paranoid hypocondriac of gargantuan proportions who spends his life in a bedroom of his mother's house, ruminating on his health, the impending collapse of civilization as we know it, and writing notes for what he expects will be the ultimate literary statement on the Middle Ages--a return to which he advocates in no uncertain terms.  But a series of comic disasters conspire to force Ignatius out into the world in search of the very thing he most dreads: a job.  In the process he tries to impose his worldview upon every one he meets, and the characters that crisscross his path are vibrant, outrageous, and as memorable as Reilly himself.<br /><br />There is, for example, LeRoy Jones, a black man with plenty of attitude, who finds himself blackmailed into working for an extremely dubious night club at below minimum wage--for Lana Lee, a \\"Nazi female\\" who is involved in illegal pornography--who employs Darlene, a wannabe stripper who has trained her pet bird to tear her clothes off while she bumps and grinds.  Incompetent police officers, gyrating old ladies, factory workers, elderly men with grave concerns about communist infiltration, and screaming homosexuals dance across the pages, each of them memorable, all of memorable, all of them laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />New Orleans itself is a memorable character in the novel, teaming with diverse ethnic communities, social snobbery, and awash in sex and alcohol, as ribald as any of the fictional characters creates.  And, I might add, portrayed with remarkable accuracy.  Toole not only captures the wild array of accents typical of the city, he captures the soul of the city iself, New Orleans as it existed in the world before Hurricane Katrina altered it forever, a portrait that is now poignant for the fact that what has been may never come again.<br /><br />This is indeed a brilliant novel, one that I tend to break out whenever I'm so blue I think I'll never laugh again.  I always do, one page after another, great big belly laughs, small snickers, strangled chortles.  It's just an amazing novel, memorable, fascinating, original, and very, very readable.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|THE BEST OF MADONNA'S CONCERTS. THE SONGS WE LOVE WITH ARRANGEMENTS YOU CAN'T BELEIVE! IMPRESSIVE PRODUCTION. FLAWLESS, PERFECT.... COREOGRAPHIES. <br />JUST GREAT! EXCELLENT COMBO DVD AND CD.  I JUST WISHED THEY HAD INCLUDED ALL THE SONGS FROM THE CONCERT IN THE CD. <br />
B00005QTAR|5.0|As TOS finally comes to an end we get a volume worthy of Trek lore.  A mediocre 3rd season had me praying for someone to put this puppy out of its misery but at least we get two episodes, the second of which even more so, that are worthy of inclusion among the very best episodes across all 3 seasons here.<br /><br />The first episode is a little silly at times but the huge redeeming factor for me is the introduction and explanation of very key characters that are pivotal to future Trek series like DS9 e.g. Kahless and the Founding Father of the Vulcans.  Also, the moral that the pursuit of science and knowledge are noble and worthy causes in and of themselves but not at the cost of misery and suffering to innocent others I found to be very relevant even today.<br /><br />The second episode is one of my all-time favourites and I even liked it better than \\"City On...Forever.\\"  Just as in that episode, there are a number of inconsistencies and strange events here like how can a completely different planet have a similar history as ours with musketeers to boot!  Ignoring this though, the side-story with Spock and McCoy is simply brilliant.  Nimoy does a very good acting job here as he shows emotions of jealousy and anger and then reverts to his usual self at the end.  A very good time-travel episode and very easily the best episode of the final season.<br /><br />If you are deciding which volumes to keep, this one falls under the \\"Must Have\\" category.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|... by the perpetually offended. For all I know, the director IS American? Not likely, otherwise he would have been strung up by the, er, more sensitive and tolerant guardians of our societies. Or at least you'd expect howls of outrage. But instead it's gotten critical acclaim. So my impression is that the director is not American.<br /><br />First, it's overlong. Many scenes are three or four times longer than necessary. Makes it more artsy, I guess?<br /><br />Second, there's precious little about miscommunication or alienation. It's about Mexicans, Moroccans, and Japanese doing inexplicably stupid things. So unbelievably stupid, it's painful to watch. It's also, ironically, a plug for having the NRA go into Morocco and perhaps the whole world to teach its kids not to shoot at cars for practice. Are these kids complete morons?<br /><br />Third, the \\"interlocking stories\\" aspect of this movie is incredibly lame. It's barely there, in fact. The Japanese angle is a total throwaway. So is the nanny \\"connection\\". The existence of these connections adds nothing to the story.<br /><br />What happened? The most probable scenario:<br /><br />Director: I've finished it! I will call it \\"Jackass: Morocco and Mexico\\"!<br /><br />Studio: You can't do that! It will flop in the critics' circles!<br /><br />Director: But it's a masterpiece of stupidity.<br /><br />Studio: Can't do it. Make it look deep or something. Critics like something that seems profound.<br /><br />Director: How about like it's about another planet, another world where people don't behave like normal people, an alien nation ...<br /><br />Studio: Alienation! Yeah, we can use that. Now all we need is a \\"deep\\" title, you know ...<br /><br />Director: Yes, an alien nation.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I report, you decide.
B000B8QF00|5.0|I know.  It doesn't explicitly say \\"greatest hits\\" but that's what this album is.  It presents the songs that were so popular with the radio audience, that they went straight to #1 (or close to it). <br /> <br />GH albums do NOT present songs that either (a) never got radio play or (b) got played but flopped, because the audience did not like them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Simple as that, and I have to say I am EXTREMELY happy with this album.  It presents the \\"best of the best\\" songs Alanis ever made, without including a lot of junk I've never heard.  ------  It's also perfect so I don't have to waste a ~$100 going out and buying all the separate albums.  I can spend a SMALL amount of money, and get the songs I remember hearing (on the radio) during the last 15+ years. <br /> <br />PERFECT. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000MTDRKE|5.0|Like so many other Neal fans I have been anticipating this release for quite some time.  I decided not to do a review until after listening to it for a solid week - about a dozen spins. <br />   <br /> <br />The Music <br /> <br /> It's no secret that this is Neal's hardest, most aggressive album to date.  Neal has a signature sound that is stamped on everything he does - so there are bits and pieces reminiscent of Transatlantic, Spock's Beard (especially Snow), and his previous solo recordings, namely Testimony, One, and ? <br /> Although there are some emotionally moving moments on this disc (less than his previous solo work), I find it is not nearly as emotionally involving as Testimony. Perhaps this is because Testimony is far more personal. Sola Scriptura is historically based and therefore slightly detached from a more personal approach. Anyway, I find it to be more melancholy and sometimes ambivalent.  That is not to say that I don't like this album, I am just trying to be fair and descriptive in my own words. <br /> The musicianship is outstanding as one would expect.  One thing I think could have made the album even better would be a much longer version of Randy's Jam. <br /> Paul Gilbert does a good job as a guest guitarist and personally I think the guest guitarist should do more guitar work than is done here.  Neal's playing is good, but there is just something extra when you add the chemistry of another player. Hopefully he will give more space to his guest guitar player on his next endeavor. Although Paul Gilbert's playing is good, it is also brief. Additionaly, I would have preferred another guitar player, like Kerry Livgren, or Phil Keaggy.  I realize that they both have played on past projects, but it would be great to have them again. <br /> <br />The Message <br /> <br /> Some reviewers have expressed their discontent with the subject matter thinking that Neal is Catholic bashing - but that is a mistake.  Neal explicitly states that is not the case in the final liner notes.  He adamantly expresses his desire to see the courage/conviction of Luther displayed in the church of today in order to bring reform/transformation where needed.  <br /> One of my favorite quotes from church history is when Martin Luther is faced with the possibility of losing his life for his belief in the sole authority of Scripture (which this album is all about) when he says \\"Here I stand, I can do no other.\\" Neal uses these words in Heaven in My heart, but somehow it doesn't convey the impact I have always felt about this powerful statement of complete abandonment to the Word of God. Regardless of the problems with other aspects of Luther's theology and ethics (especially in regard to Jews), here is a point in history where one man's choice/courage made a significant difference in the direction of the church for centuries to come. <br /> If you are a lover of progressive-rock, then his album is definitely a worthy contribution to your music library.

0895260131|5.0|By far the BEST book on radical islam i've read so far(and i've read quite a few).  Its comparisons make it really easy to read, not to mention its written really simple to understand.  The guys at P.I.G. are great.  I TOTALLY recommend this book for anyone whos curious about islam teachings, and what radical islam is.
B00004RCNQ|5.0|See other reviews for plot(i don't write plots if they have been summed up well.Just buy this movie you need it for any collection,martial arts,foreign,etc...Themes for movie is that of retribution,distrust and corruption of government.Great action and cool story with minimal effects...flawless film!
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that every actor nails their role and each performance is elevated by the performance before them.  Loaded with great actors and each character is unique with there own perspective on the goings on in the house.  No matter rich or poor, lord of the manner or servant there is a higher achy to both and gossip flows feverishly thou both as well.  The movie is very much like an Agatha Christy novel and really get immerse in the characters so much you almost forget someone got murdered.  Everyone has a motive and a reason to have done it and their is always one that didn't do it that wish they did, like someone beat them to the punch.  This is just a great movie to sit back a watch, not background noise but really watch and get immersed in the world and the lives of these characters.  one of Altman's finished works.  The film is set in the English county side in the 1930's and usually this means i steer away from, not a big fan of that combination, this time it worked for me in a big way and glad I came across this fine film.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Who are these people?  Could they be related to you?  The antics are a bit unbelievable at times, but the message is one just about anyone can relate to.  I mean, a motivational speaker who can't keep his own family motivated...a boy who doesn't speak, based on principle, but isn't smart enough to realize the obvious...an entire family that can't see that their \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" won't be casting any rays of light on anyone outside of the family circle...an uncle with unspoken life style issues?  Sound vaguely familiar? <br /> <br />Think about it.  Every family has the hair stylist, with the worst hair imaginable, the mechanic whose car is never quite right or the family member in the health care field (always giving advice) that could stand to lose a few l b's themselves.   <br /> <br />Although I have to agree with the review that said they don't understand the rave (by the critics) over this one, I did find it entertaining. <br /> <br />I recommend this to others. <br />
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I simply love \\"Peter Pan.\\"  Disney did an outstanding job digitally processing this film to make its colors bright and vivid on the screen.  The sound is wonderful as well.  There are some really nice DVD extras included with this film but I have yet to tackle all of them.  I'm too busy enjoying the actual film itself.  It's a wonderful tale not only for youngsters, but kids of thirty (like me) or more years as well.<br /><br />What's not to love about the film?  It has a high seas adventure and a boy who never wants to grow up.  It's got Tinkerbell who has become a force of her own as noted by her upcoming film.  It's got Indians, pirates, and a crocodile with a clock in his belly.  Of course, while most folks cheer on Peter Pan in his adventures, I'm sure most of us also long to see the wickedly fun Captain Hook have his day.  In all, it's as close to the perfect adventure as you can get.<br /><br />This film beckons for the days when we could play cowboys and Indians without the fear of offending anybody.  It comes from a time when our imaginations were allowed to run free.  It's childhood captured on celluloid, and it's worth every penny to purchase it.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who has children or is a kid at heart.
B00000IQW3|4.0|The Last Starfighter is not going to ever grace a Top 100 films list, but it is a great popcorn movie (particularly for people who enjoy science fiction) and a milestone in modern cinema.<br /><br />The film, first released in 1984, is essentially a knockoff of Star Wars - a small-town boy who seeks adventure but is tied down is suddenly whisked away on an adventure to outer space, where his unique skills allow him to take down an evil empire.  In this case, the boy, Alex Rogan (Lance Guest), lives in a trailer park where he does some maintenance work while trying to get a loan to go to college.  When he beats a video game at the local store, he is recruited by the Star League to become a Starfighter, or a sort of fighter pilot.  While he is off doing battle, an android replicant who has taken his place is hunted down by an assassin sent by Xur, the leader of the Kodan armada.<br /><br />There are some twists in the plot that make it different enough than Star Wars for Starfighter to be entertaining.  These include a series of scenes with the replicant and Alex's girlfriend, Maggie (Catherine Mary Stewart) back on Earth, as well as the fact that Alex is not the annoying whiner that Luke Skywalker is.  While most of the cast was never to be heard from again, Robert Preston (playing a recruiter for the Star League in his last film) uses the same energy that made him the Music Man to lighten up this film.  Also, for the real sci-fi buffs, this was one of Wil Wheaton's first roles, though you may miss him since he only runs by the screen.<br /><br />What made Starfighter unique was that it was the bridge between Tron-like computer graphics and the modern age of CGI that started with T2.  This was the first feature film to use CGI to represent real objects; almost all of the space scenes are computer-generated, which was a major milestone in 1984.  Indeed, a mildly interesting featurette on the making of the film (hosted by Guest, who does not appear to have aged well) focuses on the computer graphics effort, including showing the Cray computer on which the programming was done (it was so large that engineers could actually walk into the computer).<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a fun film where the bad guys wear black hats, the boy gets the girl, and peace and justice throughout the universe is achieved in a mere 101 minutes.  Even if you are not interested in the graphics or the history of cinema, Starfighter is a good film to watch with a bowl of popcorn on a lazy weekend afternoon.well) focuses on the computer graphics effort, including showing the Cray computer on which the programming was done (it was so large that engineers could actually walk into the computer). <br /> <br />At the end of the day, this is a fun film where the bad guys wear black hats, the boy gets the girl, and peace and justice throughout the universe is achieved in a mere 101 minutes.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|This is the kind of music that I think should be performed at home, in the dark, with complete privacy. It is self-reflective, ambiguous, non-melodic, and boring. E for effort but no thanks. David Gilmour has a wonderful voice, but this album doesn't reflect anything but noodling.
B00005JPO8|4.0|I only write this to say AVOID READING TOO MANY REVIEWS before seeing this film.Unfortunately,all of the local reviews plus the reviewers in the major papers divulged the entire plot of this movie,perhaps thinking that it would never win Best Foreign Film Award;therefore there was positively no surprise,no tension,no build up about ANYTHING as I watched critical review simply play itself out on the screen.Sometimes the best reviews say very little,so watch this film and STOP READING-IT'S FANTASTIC!    If you like actor Sebastian Koch in this film then make certain to see him in his next film BLACK BOOK.WOW!!!
0786890754|5.0|Having read Love, Rosie, I wanted to give another book by Cecelia Ahern a whirl. Many people praised PS, I Love You and I heard that a film version starring Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler was in the works, so I decided to give this book a read. This is a beautiful and poignant story much like Love, Rosie and I couldn't put it down. Thirty-year-old Holly Kennedy has lost Gerry, her husband and high school sweetheart, to cancer and she's devastated. But amid her grief, she has the comfort of her large family and her supportive friends. She also has Gerry in her life in the form of letters he wrote while he was still alive. Each letter has a month attached to it, meant to be opened and read in the assigned month. In those letters, Gerry gives Holly an assignment, something she has to do without ifs or buts, and he always ends the letters with \\"PS, I Love You.\\" The purpose of those letters is to help Holly get past her grief and to move on with her life, for she would have probably drowned in depression if it hadn't been for Gerry's thoughtful and loving gesture.<br /><br />This book made me cry. It is such a sweet, poignant novel that truly touches the reader. Cecelia Ahern has once again succeeded in moving me. How could someone so young write about human relationships in such a way? I've sometimes suspected that these books are ghostwritten and that Ahern just puts her name on them, but that is an unfair assumption. Perhaps Ahern, daughter of an Irish prime minister and someone in her early to mid twenties, could truly write stuff like this. I enjoyed the scenes with flashbacks of Holly's life with Gerry and in the sad scenes where she'd imagined him near her. I also like the scenes centered on her hilarious and eccentric family. Then there is the character Daniel, who seemed to be Holly's new love interest. I didn't know what to make of him. The novel manages to surprise you in some areas, so the outcome is not completely predictable. I love this novel -- another winner by this author. Love, Rosie is still my favorite for being the first Ahern book I read and because that one is all the more touching than this one, if possible. I cannot recommend PS, I Love You (can't wait for the movie!) and Love, Rosie enough and I cannot wait to read If You Could See Me Now. Cecelia Ahern has won a new devoted fan!nner by this author.

B00005JPLU|4.0|I can say that this is one of the bloodiest movies in recent history, and I can only imagine when they likely (and hopefully) release an unrated directors cut to DVD. King Leonitus of the Spartans leads 300 warriors against the \\"god king\\" of persia and his massive army.  Needless to say, its very bloody, war is never pretty, but the hand to hand combat back the had to be brutal.  The artistic quality of the film are very much like those used in Sin City, And the effects rival those of lord of the rings and the matrix.  But again, this is a very violent,bloody movie, its like the movie gladiator, but hopped up on steroids.  Check it out, interesting, not a dull moment.
1582701709|5.0|This is a great book.  Everything was so applicable to the everyday world.
0671646788|5.0|I'm not really big on the self help/inspirational genre of books, but I really enjoyed this book and think that it is one I will go back to again and again for a motivational pick-me-up.   <br /> <br />Yes, much of the advice is common sense, and certainly many of the ideas have been co-opted by more \\"modern\\" positive thinking gurus, but I really do think that reading the book has, at least for the time being, changed my outlook on things and made me see that some of my thinking was self-defeating.  I enjoyed many of the anecdotes that Schwartz peppered throughout his text to reaffirm some of his positive ideas.   <br /> <br />Five stars.
B000JJSJR8|5.0|Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much.  It was much better than I expected it to be.  The picture was good and it is one of my favourite mafia movies.  I would say it is worth the money to go get it.  Joe Pesci did a great job playing part of the mafia.
B000CC4GEW|3.0|I have this on VHS and its great. I burned a copy to my DVD and it still looked good. For some reason this purchased DVD looks worst then my DVD copy. The colors are more muted and the widescreen looks small. Love the movie so why can't they do a better DVD. On the other hand, the service from supplyer69 was great
1582701709|1.0|If you saw the video, don't bother with the book. Or vise versa. The book is just the same content as the video in text form. I was expecting more information, thought it would go deeper into each topic, but it's exactly like the video...It reminded me of those books with a read along tape kids have. <br />    If you're looking for more content, look to a different author. If you want a quick reference guide, then this is the one for you.
B0000VD04M|5.0|How could you not love anything with Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker and Ms. Arquette. Oh, and the fact that it was produced by Tim Burton...well....geen whiz, you've got yourself a classic. Aside from the brilliant character Depp creates of Ed Wood, I love the portrayal of Bella Lugosi by Martin Landau.

B00005JPLU|5.0|Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, 300, brings to the screen THE most heroic battle in world history: the Battle at Thermopylae; a three day battle (August 18th, 480 BC through August 20th, 480 BC) for the pass at Thermopylae (the Hot Gates) between an massive Persian host under King Xerxes and a small Greek force led by King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans.  Unlike the Alamo, Custer's Last Stand and many other glorious battles where the parties involved did not expect to be wiped out, the Spartans willingly held their positions knowing that they could not possibly win against such overwhelming odds.   <br />Gerard Butler (!), Lena Headey (who is GORGEOUS!), Vincent Regan, David Wenham (Faramir from LOR), and the rest of this exceptional cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!   <br />The setting, the music, the special effects and the dialogues, are all wonderful! <br />300 is a movie about honor, real men, and real heroes who fought and died in the name of Sparta, Greece and Freedom.  <br />Strongly recommended along with Steven Pressfield's best-selling novel Gates of Fire and the 1962 classic film The 300 Spartans. <br />
B00004XPPB|5.0|What a combo. When this movie was made, Depp was emerging as a truly great actor, alongside the great Al Pacino. Fantastic!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film.

B0000UJDLM|5.0|In some ways,this is not my usual choice of \\"old\\" movies- usually movies before 1967. In other ways, it is exactly my kind of movie, funny with no gratutious violence or anything to embarrass you if seeing it with your friends or children. I had forgotten a lot of this movie so it was like seeing it again for the first time. I loved it. Short Circuit, Short Circuit II and Batteries Not Included are always a pleasure to watch. Kids like them as well so they are great family fare.
B00005JPLU|5.0|300 is a stunning depiction of one of the most famous battles in all human history. I am not a fan of graphic novels but the vivid stylization and surreal backdrops of this film make it by far one of the most visually captivating films I have seen in at least a decade. 300 is not an epic fairy tale of Lord of the Rings or Gladiator proportions, but rather a brilliantly perceived historical telling masterfully produced with modern appeal. Though not wholly accurate, this version of the battle of Thermopylae is definitely exciting and inspiring. [Quit quibbling! We know the facial piercings, makeup, chromium masks, sexed-up costumes and deformities are exaggerations. That is why it is called \\"entertainment\\"!! As long as it gets a history book opened somewhere...] Breathtaking photography sets the stage for a group of actors so well congealed even the real Leonidas would be proud. Characters burst out of virtually every scene with emotion the likes that god has never seen. A steely ride through the depths of human passion, greed, desire, honor, lust and even humor. If you can only make one trip this spring, visit Sparta. It's amazing in the shade.<br /><br />*In regards to all the critic comments of a film for, \\"male posturing and bravado\\", this is one woman Spartan enough to call you out on those statistics.<br /><br />**Somewhere I envision a tattoo of the words, \\"The Twenty-Five\\" encircling a tribal pug's head. Hoo-ha!
B00005JPLU|5.0|An Epic Epoche to play on words. 300 was nothing short of breathtaking. You think this looks like a brainless testosterone driven film? Youre stark raving mad. The film begins with a narrative story of Leonidas upbringing, giving the viewer of feel of a Spartan warriors childhood. It takes a minute to show emotion, and then another to show sparta's traditionalism. Then, the show begins. <br /> <br />Zach Snyders use of visual backgrounds, slow motion editing, and palette of colors is mindblowing to say the least. This beats out even his DOTD remake. If I were on the academy, I would definately nominate 300 for best cinematography. Hands Down. The script is wonderful, using just sentences to relay emotions. With spots of humor, the dialogue is amazing even using lines from the greek stories themselves. Such as \\"Eat a hardy breakfast for tonight we dine in Hell\\"(Hades). The soundtrack did its part too. With a heavy tone that still hits you where it counts it also portrays the feelings of the Spartans when they as warriors cannot express them.  <br /> <br />Finally, the cast. Some parts may have been miscast by look.(Blondes werent that numerous in Greece), but not miscast by talent. Using recognizable faces but not over-exposed \\"movie stars\\" the cast was great. Props to all the men who trained to look so dang intimidating. But nobody, nobody measures up to Gerard Butler. I think a very underrated actor, Gerard made this movie. He was the apitome of brilliant in every scene. Having a seemingly obsessive lure to period films (Phantom of the Opera, Timeline, Attila) he was bound to get cast in this part. This part that he made his, in every way shape or form to make King Leonidas one of the 21st centuries best characters yet.  <br />

B00005B4GU|4.0|Amnesiac,(IMO) is Radiohead's best. I know most people wouldn't agree. The band is really interesting to me. With each album they just seemed to get better and better & changing their style throughout. Although my favorite type of music in High School was punk, a couple years later after graduation I stumbled along this band from a friend. Radiohead opened up a whole new world of music to me, honestly. And although they are no longer my favorite band, I still love this 2001 release Amnesiac. To me, Amnesiac is Radiohead's best effort in the direction the band is taking now. I prefer the vocals on this, compared to Kid A, this has a lot more vocal range, with an edgy unsettling attitude. A wonderfully dark album w/ majestic engaging music throughout. This in my opinion is a very under-rated release compared to earlier studio efforts, such as The Bends(1995) or OK Computer(1997)-seems to be most peoples favorite. \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" feels like rough texture to the ears. \\"You & Whose Army\\"-piano beauty. \\"Hunting Bears\\" is a haunting type of instrumental. \\"Knives Out\\" is my personal favorite with layered, booming, sounds with cryptic intense words. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\"- the most danceable,with words \\"lets go down a waterfall,\\" beauty blended w/ spooky.This version of \\"Morning Bell\\" to me isn't as good as the Kid A version. \\"Pyramid Song\\" sounds like a piano floating in a whirlwind rainstorm - very lush. The closing track \\"Life In A Glasshouse\\" has a bluesy-jazz feel to it. It can really take the listener on an adventure. This is a lot better than Thom Yorke's \\"The Eraser\\" (2006) first solo work, w/ computer made sounds. Amnesiac although a little sad, is really an eerie,chiming grandfather clock-like clicks,(?)dark and moody album that stays with you. And a real change in music for me, when I first heard it.

B000002OAZ|5.0|This cd exceeded my expectations. The 60's rockers backing up their idol Howlin Wolf in the twilight of his career sounded as if they had been a unit for years. The musicians manage to give the songs a fresh sound while still staying true to its roots. The Howlin Wolf although at the recording was becoming more and more ill infuses his ailing into his singing to make the listener feel the blues. Excellent CD.

It's my instructions on how to live life in a empowering positive way. Immediately, I felt not only connected to the book but to myself in such a unconditional happy way.  This book puts me first and helps me make more solid decisions to improve my life for myself.  My intutiveness sharpened and my self conscious was revived to improved levels of perspectives.  You will feel encouraged about life reading this book and most definetly applying chapters to your ways of thinking.  It invites you to live your fullest and have a wonderful fullfilled quality of life. Our lives all should be lived in  many happy moments. This is a have to read deal, how can you beat the inexpensive easy read to improve the quality of your life full circle!
B00005QEO2|5.0|If someone were new to the band Aerosmith I would definitely recommend two CDs,one would be this collection and the other would be \\"O'Yeah\\" between these 2 collections the casual fan would have all the essential Aerosmith tunes recorded both during their Columbia career and their Geffen career<br /><br />sure,some of the songs are repeated,but the bonus and hard to find tracks are well worth buying both sets<br /><br />in fact,even if you are like me and own every Aerosmith album,it's still worth buying both collections for the convenience of having all the songs on 2 easy to carry CDs and of course for the bonus materials<br /><br />normally I'm very irritated by bands that release numerous 'greatest hits' packages (for example,Kiss,Iron Maiden,Heart,Def Leppard,Motley Crue,Poison,to name a few) but in the case of Aerosmith I would definitely recommend this one and 'O Yeah' ,as for the original 'greatest hits' collection,it is all songs from the 70s and all the songs can be found on 'O Yeah' except for 'Remember' and 'Come Together' but you can either download those two songs (legally of course) or buy the CD since it is relatively inexpensive,same with the latest 'greatest hits' package,it features all the same songs found on these 2 collections except for 2 new songs (which are both really good) but can be legally downloaded very inexpensively<br /><br />back to the point here...this CD collection 'Young Lust' features the songs from the bands Geffen years,and does a nice job of covering every album from that time period (unlike 'Oh Yeah' which ignores 'done with mirrors' completely) and shows why the band dominated the airwaves and MTV throughout the late 80s early 90s...this is essential listening for all fans of rock music<br /><br />and is a great overview (along with O Yeah) for anyone that is just discovering these great American rock legends!<br /><br />the upside - has all the hits you could ever want from the Geffen years in one easy to carry package<br /><br />the downside - can't really think of any<br /><br />the bottom line - If you love Aerosmith,or rock in general,run out and buy this CD...donutman says so!!!> <br />the downside - can't really think of any <br /> <br />the bottom line - If you love Aerosmith,or rock in general,run out and buy this CD...donutman says so!!!

B000FFJ85I|4.0|I have become a huge fan of AFI over the past couple years...<br /><br />I heard them quite by accident,but I was hooked immediately<br /><br />I loved all the songs from the album 'Sing The Sorrow' so I checked out their earlier work and it sounded very different,much more punk influenced then goth influenced,so when I heard they were releasing a new album I didn't know what to expect...I was hoping that decemberunderground would sound like 'sing the sorrow' but it really doesn't...but I'm not disappointed,in fact this is a nice step forward...the songwriting is really amazing,it makes me respect this band even more!<br /><br />I can't really pick out a favorite song,as this is one of the rare albums that sounds better when played from beginning to end rather then one song at a time<br /><br />it creates an atmosphere,a mood,it wraps you up in the moment which is something all the great albums can do (think pink floyd the wall,or the new my chemical romance album the black parade)<br /><br />I absolutely love this band and would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys great rock music,there are some very catchy hooks here,some dance beats (yes,it actually works) with a touch of the dark goth sound from 'sing the sorrow' but a step forward,more like panic at the disco (with better songwriting and lyrics)<br /><br />I still like 'Sing The Sorrow' a little better but decemberunderground is really growing on me,this band has a tremendous future as long as they can stay together and record label doesn't give up on them<br /><br />the upside - everything,great songs,great performances,and top notch production<br /><br />the downside - I can't really think of any<br /><br />the bottom line - for anyone who likes rock music with a real commercial yet dark edge..this band is awesome and one of my absolute favorites...decemberunderground is a great album start to finish,go out and buy it now...donutman says so!!!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger Than Fiction was a wonderful movie, plain and simple. The writing is smart, direction crisp, and the acting is fantastic. Inspired acting all around from Farrell to Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is just utterly wonderful) to Thompson (especially Emma Thompson, who everyone knows is a fantastic actor but it is truly evident why that is a fact here in this movie) to Queen Latifah to Dustin Hoffman! Just wonderful all around and a great, impressive movie.<br /><br />Now, I found the story even more interesting because I am a writer. Not only because the movie deals with an author and his/her characters but it also illustrates how Harold is a character written by an author and neither of them have much of a life. Both are people who go about their lives but don't really live. Hell, the author spends her time thinking about death more than life. It's funny, romantic (in a very real and strange way - no canned romantic lines but a very real feeling interaction between two very real characters), touching, visually interesting, a little fantastical, and all around perfect.<br /><br />I really liked this movie a lot. It made me laugh out loud. And it made me want to buy it. And that's saying something with the current crop of movies that have and are coming out.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca was a good movie, a very good one indeed. There were true characters in the movie, not people playing themselves, which was very refreshing in the face of today's movie climate. <br /> <br />There are so many plot points and mini twists and turns in the dialogue and character interaction that this is a movie one has to watch several times to get the full experience. <br /> <br />Ingrid Bergman gives a very good and skillful performance, even better than Bogart. But the whole cast is very good, and this is just a classic movie for everyone to see, ecspecially if you think that profanity laden erotic murder makes for the best movie of all time. <br /> <br />The different style makes it unattractive at first, but let that go and see the majesty that is Casablanca.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|After almost thirty some odd years of being a die hard Fan,this concert rejuvenated My Well Being, and Soul. One could see and feel the utmost spiritual aura that came forth from all the band members fingers and voices, as they played their instruments and sang in such beautiful harmony. <br />                  I became totally mesmermized in viewing and listening to them on this musical DVD in front of my entertainment center. An uplifting,emotional and a very much enjoyed,production of Famous Musicians <br />that I will continue to view and listen to for many years to come!!

B000MGUZM0|5.0|I was about to buy this release without listening to any of the tracks, which is a pretty big gamble these days.  However, their debut album was really good.  I first listened to a few of the songs off of Neon Bible on Rhapsody and everything I heard was unbelievably well written.  After hearing \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\" I got out of my chair, got into my car and drove to the record store.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Stranger Than Fiction is the story of a straight-laced IRS agent who wakes up one morning to find that he can hear a narrator detailing his every action and thought. Suffice it to say he's \\"weirded out\\", until the voice mentions that his immenint death is approaching. At this point, he sets out to find out who the narrator is and why he's going to die.<br /><br />Will Ferrell continues to expand his film repertoire. In Stranger Than Fiction, he proves he's got the dramatic capability to handle deep emotions and a bland character without becoming boring. This shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone who's seen any of Farrell's other movies. Even during slapstick comedy, there's a hint of a genuine human behind the character's Farrell creates.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally strong. Maggie Gyllenhaal (although only given a passing notice in the trailer) is actually the other half of the romantic duo in this romantic dramedy... if that's what it can be classified as. She creates a very real person out of what could have been an over-the-top tax-evading ultra-liberal bakery owner. The chemistry between Farrell and Gyllenhaal is great.<br /><br />Emma Thompson brings the drama back to the film with her depressed writer character and Dustin Hoffman seems to be reprising his role from I Heart Huckabees as a linguistics professor seeking to help Farrell figure out what's happening to him. Why is Queen Latifah in this movie? I guess the questions the producers asked was \\"why not?\\" Other than that, I have no answer, but her character is pretty nondescript and she manages to play it in a pretty nondescript way. Really, it could have been anyone. Tony Hale, of Arrested Development fame, makes a small, seemingly forgettable character into a thrill to watch.<br /><br />The story is a little convoluted and there are plenty of points that could be brought up questioning the randomness with which some of Harold Crick's actions are described directly by the narrator, while some obviously are not (such as talking to the writer himself, because she's obviously not writing while he's talking to her). Overall, though, the film is so genuinely enjoyable that it's not worth questioning the finer points.<br /><br />There are plenty of extras on this DVD. It's a package worth the price.r, while some obviously are not (such as talking to the writer himself, because she's obviously not writing while he's talking to her).

B00005JPG1|5.0|First of all, I loved the multimillion dollar recreation of San Francisco in its days of hippie glory in the 1960s and 1970s.  As though to show time changing, Fincher calls in all his CGI friends to building the Transamerica Pyramid (600 Montgomery Street) before our eyes, and eventually leaves it as another tall, lit-up silhouette on the famous horizon.  Better than anything else, the Pyramid shows the difference between the new and the old city.<br /><br />Anthony Edwards makes an amazing return (and his hair does too) playing Bill Armstrong, the lead detective on the case and the partner of Dave Toschi, an outspoken Italian-American cop played in colorful, John-Garfield-in-Tortilla-Flat style by Mark Ruffalo.  I nearly didn't recognize Ruffalo without Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Garner playing opposite him, but here he is as the man's man many think that Dirty Harry Callahan was based on, and he's almost convincing.  As a pas de trois between three fabulously talented male stars (Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, and Robert Downey Jr.) ZODIAC is never boring, and whenever Anthony Edwards comes on screen the movie rises up another notch.<br /><br />Maybe the women don't do so well, though Clea Duvall is striking as the jailbird sister of one of the very first Zodiac victims.  But whoever is playing Ruffalo's wife has almost nothing to do except cast knowing silhouettes, and Chloe Sevigny, as the love interest for Robert Downy Jr's character, looks sour throughout, like someone was feeding her lemon flavored epsom salts through a tube.  Ciara Hughes makes an astounding screen debut as the mysterious Darlene Ferrin; you can believe that whoever committed the Zodiac murders knew her well and wanted to know her better.  I expect this beautiful young actress will have a great career in Hollywood, if she wants one.<br /><br />But basically you will want to know how creepy the show is--and the answer is plenty.  The movie begins with a radio segue, from Three Dog Night singing \\"Easy to be Hard\\" into the acid-rock freakout of John Paul Bonham, Alan Parker, Jimmy Page proto Led Zep of Donovan's \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" as the suspense and the darkness ratchet up.  Putside the theater the marquee blinked on and off all evening, \\"WHY DID THE KILLER STOP KILLING?  IS HE STILL ALIVE?  COULD HE BE SITTING NEXT TO YOU?\\"  You didn't even want to look up to see who was anywhere in the rows around you.  If someone touched me I would scream.singing \\"Easy to be Hard\\" into the acid-rock freakout of John Paul Bonham, Alan Parker, Jimmy Page proto Led Zep of Donovan's \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" as the suspense and the darkness ratchet up.

0441172717|1.0|This is a chore. I don't go for complex storylines and this book is the worst of the worst for those. I kept turning back to read over parts I had not taken in the first time, and in the end I gave up. I got to almost half-way, but I had lost interest way before then.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a great look at politics today.  Everyone should see it.  It should make you really think about what is happening in the world.

B000I5X81K|3.0|I liked Josh Groban from the first moment I heard and saw him sing. Let's get that disclaimer out of the way. Let's get Disclaimer #2 also taken care of: I own everything Josh Groban has recorded and have video-taped (yeah, I know, old technology but it is still workable) some of his television performances. I am a John Groban fan and Disclaimer #3, the most powerful one of all: my wife loves Josh Groban.<br /><br />AWAKE is a good solid album, good songs, solid arrangements, and that amazing voice. But, for me, it doesn't have the snap or the crackle I have come to expect from him. Perhaps it is still youthful enthusiasm leading him a little astray in his song choices or less-than-helpful advice from those around him. I just don't know. What I do know is that there's is a lot of music to come from this young man and I am glad I'm around right now to enjoy the journey with him. AWAKE is a good marker along the this path.<br /><br />Buy it, listen to it, enjoy it, but don't for a minute think this is the best he can do. I can and will do much more. Of that I am confident. Until then, I will come back to this album every once in a while but will always wind up at the first album. AWAKE says, \\"I'm close.\\" When the album comes along that says, \\"Now I have a clean vision and I know where I am going\\" - THAT will be worth the wait and the enjoyable sign post albums we've had to listen to along the way.
1582701709|5.0|Thanks for being prompt.  I received my order within 3 - 4 days!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Loved this movie.  Good writing and acting; excellent special effects.  The story slowly unfolds and at the end you realize you had clues as to what was going to happen as the film progressed.  Well done; I definitely plan to keep this movie in my video library.
1569242739|2.0|The instructions look easy, but in the introduction, the authors add a lot of extra precautions that ultimately make the product difficult to make.  My family and I were not pleased with the results and the ingredients aren't all that healthy.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I LOVED this movie! I guess I am a bit partial to it since I lived in Boston for a while and I know some about the background of the \\"underworld\\" in Beantown. However that said even if you have never been there and know nothing about it, you will still enjoy this great, fast paced thriller!
1582701709|5.0|I have the DVD and Book.  I have watched the DVD twice now and read the book once and starting on it again.  I have always believed in this type process, which is really the power of POSITIVE THINKING. As if you believe like I do, the ask and you will receive idea from the Bible.  There is one thing though you need to truly have Faith and believe it.    Get the Book or the DVD I highly recommend them.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|This film has the potential of becoming a classic. A convict is sent back in time to find out about the virus that eliminated the majority of mankind.  Bruce Willis offers as a magnificent perfomance while tyhe directing and photography are great too.  The plot has enough twists and an unexpecting ending.<br /><br />All in all a film that you will enjoy.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This DVD is amazing. Both from a technical point of view and for it's content. And I'm usually a harsh critic...
B000L43QJ2|5.0|What makes a Swan Lake traditional?  Some might say it should follow the Petipa/Ivanov model, but they did not really honor Tchaikovsky's intentions and even used some music not written by him!  He was so furious that he divorced himself from the project.  To be called \\"traditional\\"  A Swan Lake really needs to borrow from Petipa/Ivanov but also needs to keep Tchaikovsky's intentions alive as well as utilizing modern expectations.  Suffice it to say that this performance certainly qualifies.  The choreography is outstanding and complex as is the dancing by all.  This Swan Lake is quite different from Nureyev's version with Margot Fonteyn.  The first act in this one is more complete, but the black swan pas de deux is along the Petipa/Ivanov concept whereas the one with Fonteyn utilized Tchaikovsky's original concept.  The choreography does have Nureyev's concept of balancing male and female dancing.  The scenery and costumes are somewhat simpler here than in the older one, but still appropriate and interesting.  The most beautiful aspect of this performance is simply that it is danced by the Paris Opera Ballet, one of the greatest ballet companies in the world!  This is a wonderful, complete Swan Lake and is highly recommended!
B00000GAIW|4.0|I have owned this album in every format possible (vinyl, 8-track, cassette, CD) and have loved it & listened to it over & over for 30 years.  This release, which boasts some interesting bonus material, disappointed me on the remastering end.  It is still relatively thin, low in volume & fidelity.  This new CD release is like all the others, you can never play it loud enough - it simply doesn't CRANK.  My vinyl version had the highest fidelity of all the formats, which had some great bottom end & crisp highs (before the inevitable scratches & pops, of course) and it could be played LOUD.  While riffs from Aqualung & My God sounded big & piercing on vinyl, they sound subdued & repressed on every CD release and sadly this one as well.   <br /> <br />It makes me wonder what was going on in the control room when they were remastering this, because I really hear no improvement.  On the strength of the songs themselves, I would rate this album 5 stars.  On the basis of their latest \\"remastering\\" job, however, I would give it only 3 stars.  I guess Aqualung will forever be UNCRANKABLE!! <br /> <br />For an incredible remastering job, check out \\"Warchild\\".  They've really beefed up the mix with great fidelity & deep bottom end, plus some awesome bonus tracks.  Now, \\"Warchild\\" is definately CRANKABLE!!
0515141429|5.0|<br />Contrary to what many reader's believe Lee Child is British, but moved with his family from Cumbria to the United States to begin a new career as an American thriller writer. What probably fools a lot of people is that is rare for a British author to be able to write American thrillers with any kind of authenticity. He has won a number of awards with his books and he lives just outside New York City with his American wife Jane. The couple have a grown-up daughter, Ruth and when Lee is not writing he shares his time between music, reader and supporting the New York Yankees. <br /> <br />When Jack Reacher hops off a Greyhound bus near the little town of  Margrave, he little realises that in a couple of shakes of a rabbits tale, he is going to end up in jail. The ex-military cop is the only stranger in town, so he is the obvious choice of suspect for a murder that has been committed. <br /> <br />It soon becomes obvious that Reacher is not the murderer, but imagine his surprise when one of the victims turns out to be his brother. This obviously makes it personal for Jack and his investigations soon uncover things below the surface of what appears to be a sleepy little town, but on closer inspection is anything but.
B00006JKON|4.0|I was more than impressed with this release of \\"Warchild\\", because not only do we get some solid bonus tracks, the fidelity is flawless.  This has a nice bottom end & crisp highs, which is everything I craved out of \\"Aqualung\\" (see my \\"Aqualung\\" review).  I have owned this album in every format but 8-track, and this is by far the best.    David Palmer's orchestration on this album always weighed on me a little, but I still enjoyed it.  This is Ian at his most Shakespearean (he even looks like him), which might annoy the uninitiated.  Personally, I always preferred \\"Lick Your Fingers Clean\\" to \\"Two Fingers\\" due to the latter's overly lush arrangment.  Plus, you get some killer extra tracks like \\"Paradise Steakhouse\\", \\"Glory Row\\" and \\"Quartet\\".  This release is a more than fitting restoration & return to regular song structures.  So, buy it.  It definately CRANKS!!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This version has new and extended scenes that fill in the gaps that your mind normally does and provide more back story on the war and the characters personal lives.  The most notable is Michael's back story (for those of you who wondered who that girl was in the picture in his apt.), and an extended look at the back story of the war and Lucian's \\"defeat\\" and also some nudity (because a movie with vampires and no sex makes no sense).  Also includes great full length commentary with Len, Kate and Scott.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have another version of this movie in LD.  I like the story very much and its idea of using the Post Office to prove officially the existence of the Santa is so much better than the 1994 remake.  This edition provides the best of both world (Colour and B/W)for me as well.  All in all, it is a great value package for a young at heart.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink continues to break the mold. Love U and your hand. I especially love Dear Mr. President! She has a strong voice and attitude. She continues to wow us with her thoughtful lyrics.
