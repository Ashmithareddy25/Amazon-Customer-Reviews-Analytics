B000067CPX|2.0|Lost in the fact that this is the band's most eclectic and adventurous work to date is the fact that they simply aren't a rock band anymore. The band's strong suits used to be the power-funk basslines of Flea, with Kiedis bellowing out largely meaningless lyrics. Aside from the title track and the goofy \\"Can't Stop\\", those traits are essentially absent. If that meant Frusciante would get to steal the show with his riffs, a la Californication, even he sounds comatose on this one. It's an album of monotone pop ballads and the occasional diversion. Two of the latter, Cabron and On Mercury, are entirely listenable, but RHCP has earned the right to have great things expected of them. This record fails to deliver.
068987474X|2.0|Greg Behrendt may be one of those guys who hates having women call him, but he and his co-writer should be ashamed for writing an entire book based on a stereotype. Most guys do NOT mind being called for a date, especially by women they gave their number to for that purpose! <br /> <br />Go ahead and get this book if you're a fan of SATC, but don't assume the advice will apply to more than a relative handful of men. If you're meeting guys who seem like the ones described here, you need to start looking somewhere else.
B000002GJH|5.0|Matt Cameron on drums. Chris Cornell on vocals. Mike McCready and Stone Gossard on guitar. Jeff Ament plays bass. The term 'supergroup' would not mean anything if it weren't for this band. More songwriting and performing talent was present in the studio for TotD than any other record I own. While Eddie Vedder only appears on Hunger Strike, Chris Cornell's voice makes a surprisingly good counterpoint to Mike McCready's wailing guitars, which absolutely dominate this record. 'Reach Down' is a ten-minute epic prayer to the god of Rock, with a great solo followed by stunning a capella. 'Call Me a Dog' is one of Cornell's true lyrical masterpieces. Of course, if you had to pick five songs to define the Seattle movement, 'Hunger Strike' would be on the list. The PJ guys' ability to do 'mellow' allows Cornell to cut loose on songs like this a lot more than he did with Soundgarden.
B0002YLC24|2.0|Rather than an immediate sequel ( Rocky II, Rocky III, <br />et al ), Before Sunset  simmered for nine years, allowing <br />the director, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy to age <br />and grow and calcify. I didn't care for Before Sunrise, <br />principally because I flinch at Ethan Hawke's acting, <br />and because it was a dialogue movie without much <br />magic in the dialogue. <br /> <br />Before Sunset is another dialogue movie --- but the <br />dialogue is absent any particular clarity or distinction, <br />unless your standard is TV situation comedies. There <br />is no significant reach in verbal expression or poetry. <br /> <br />I would rather listen to and look at Nick and Nora Charles <br />nine years later - or Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory <br />( My Diner With Andre ) than these two.  <br /> <br />The chemistry seems contrived and the ongoing references <br />to sexual activities removes the sensuality from the <br />relationship. It does end quite well - fading out without <br />any momentous denoument - or declaration that we will <br />have these two to look forward to again somewhere <br />down the road.
B000683VI4|5.0|While flying back from Hawaii, I was able to watch this movie.  I didn't really know anything about the movie and wasn't too excited about seeing it.  But, without much else to do, I decided to give it a try and boy am I glad I did!  This has got to be one of my all time favorite movies.( I don't want to give away any of the story)  Afterwards, I got up to strectch my legs and saw the  whole plane full of people crying, both men and women!  Later, the flight attendant asked if I had seen the movie(I think she saw my teary eyes).  I told her yes and that I loved it.  She told me there was man in first class around my age (26) who told her that he wished his wife was with him on that flight so they could have watched it together.  She then told me that he told her that he would now be a better man and husband for having seen this movie!  I am preordering copies for almost everyone on Christmas list!!!
B00005JMUA|5.0|If you like violent characters and a great story, then you should see Kill Bill Vol. 2 for you won't be sorry.    Tarantino is a film genious and after taking a couple years rest, he is back at it with the Kill Bill series which is his best.    Kill Bill Vo. 1 was all about blood and gore, so I was expecting Kill Bill Vol. 2 to show more.    However after seeing Kill Bill Vol. 2 I realized that it was not, the second part of the story is all about developing the plot.    Although violence only occupies a few scenes, it does not make Vol. 2 worse by any means.    The characters are intriguing and their performances stunning, and we finally get a glimpse into what started this story that is so cunning.    Although this movie won't be nominated for any awards it is certainly deserving, I guess that the violence and the premise is a little too unnerving.    So if there is only one movie that you choose to see, I highly recommend that Kill Bill Vol. 2 it should be.

B000092ZYX|5.0|If you are still wondering if you wanna shell those $$s  for this album, you are reading the right review :) I'll try to make this as unbiased as possible: meaning that even though I am a big time fan of Radiohead over the years (from bends through Amnesiac), I'll try to rate this relative to their other ventures. Now if you are totally new to Radiohead, believe me, it's worth investing your time and money to check out their music! Ok, with that bit of an intro, let's head to the track-by track review and figure out how many *s this album actually deserves: <br /> <br />1. \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" - 4 / 5 - A nice hard rock song, that reminds me of their good old song \\"Just\\". It's not an exceptional track as many have suggested. It's an all out rock song, with none of the radiohead's \\"it grows on you\\" factor in there :)  <br /> <br />2. \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\" - 4.5 / 5 - Here's where they get warmed up and start showing you the signs of their brilliance! Although this is one of their simplest of songs, it is extremely catchy and sticks in your head!  <br /> <br />3. \\"Sail To The Moon\\" - 4.5 / 5 - For all those who thought Radiohead was just a beat machine, you'll be surprised with the vocal range of Thom Yorke! This is a beautiful, melodic song with one of the best vocal renditions of Thom. <br /> <br />4. \\"Backdrifts\\" - 3.5 / 5 - A cool song with creative electronic beats. But nothing great to write home about. <br /> <br />5. \\"Go To Sleep\\" - 4 / 5 - A pretty straight forward rock song. But I am surprised why Radiohead chose this song to be one of their singles.. when they have better songs on the album. <br /> <br />6. \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" - 5 / 5 - A classic radiohead track!!! This song really \\"grows on you\\"! With really good lyrics and eerie sounds, this is one of the highlights of the album and a delight for the fans! <br /> <br />7. \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" - 4.5 /5 - The first few times, I hated this song and kept skipping this song. But after a while, I got hooked andboy, this turned out to be another brilliant track! It starts off real slow, but then, the chorus and the stunning ending elevates this to the Radiohead level! <br /> <br />8. \\"The Gloaming\\" - 3 / 5 - An OK song. Reminiscent of their \\"Kid A / Amnesiac\\" era.. both of which I liked.. but this track is just average. <br /> <br />9. \\"There There\\" - 5 / 5 - One of their very best. I personally think that this is one of the most creative (both musically and lyrically), radio friendly song ever created! The lyrics, vocals, drums and the guitars are all top notch! This is what Paranoid Android is to OK Computer.  <br /> <br />\\"We are accidents waiting to happen..\\". This track alone is worth the all the $$s!! <br /> <br />10. \\"I Will\\" - 5 /5 - Another great song with only vocals and minimal arrangements. The simplicity, and innocence (\\"little babies eyes..\\") portrayed in the lyrics do justice to the melencholy of the vocals. <br /> <br />11. \\"A Punch Up At A Wedding\\" - 4.5 /5 - A nice, piano laden track. The mood in this song is kinda continued in tracks 13 and 14.  <br /> <br />12. \\"Myxomatosis\\" - 4 / 5 - \\"Airbag\\" Part 2? This is much more straight forward and accessible than Airbag which had complicated arrangements and lyrics. Nevertheless, a good, catchy listen. <br /> <br />13. \\"Scatterbrain\\" - 4.5 / 5 - Believe me, this grows on you! A nice song, kinda defines the mood for the next track. <br /> <br />14. \\"A Wolf At The Door\\" - 5 / 5 - A great song to finish the album!! With Beethoven's \\"moonlight sonata\\" playing in the background..Radiohead close the album with another of their creative masterpieces! The last time anybody tried such fusion were the beatles, (Moonlight sonata is played in the reverse on \\"Because\\" from Abbey Road). <br /> <br />So that wraps up this long review! The avg rating comes to 4.35 / 5.0 but I've rounded it up to 5 .. out of the sheer love for Radiohead :) Truly, Radiohead's creative brilliance is sprinkled all over the album, although the album as a whole is not flawless. But these moments of brilliance is what we've all been waiting for!! It reminds us that Radiohead, after all the years, is still capable of producing fresh, non-repetetive, music which puts them in a different league altogether! Hail to the commitment of the band members to produce something different with every release! So, regardless of your previous Radiohead experience, this album, on its own, is worth every penny.
B000002HMH|5.0|Now I've heard alot of complaining from people commenting on how this band took a turn for the worse after \\"Metallica\\" and that the 90's and on was garbage. This is not true. What they have on this album quality stuff, despite its different sound. I applaud the band for trying something new, yet still keeping a good sound. They owe nothing to you 80's die-hards. It's their music, not yours. That being said, I am kinda biased. I started off on the load/metallica stuff and gradually got into their early work, so maybe my sense of what's good and what isn't may be off. <br />Over all, all the songs on \\"Load\\" are great. The guitar is solid, hell the whole band is. Bleeding Me is very moving, I think Metallica's lengthiest songs tend to be their best work. If you are into Metallica and aren't so arrogant to believe the band somehow failed you, this album is a must. \\"St. Anger\\" on the other hand...*sigh* thats another story...
6305364648|2.0|True Lies (James Cameron, 1994)<br /><br />Perhaps in the hands of any director who's not one of the Great Triumvirate of Hollywood Hacks-- Steven Spielberg, Joel Schumacher, and James Cameron-- True Lies would have been an interesting and funny satire on the mindless-action-film genre. After all, it was clever enough to actually pull in real action-film star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Instead, it comes off looking as if James Cameron actually took the script seriously, and the result is overlong, boring, and not too terribly fun to watch.<br /><br />Harry Tasker (The Governator) is a secret agent whose wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks he's a computer salesman. Harry finds out his wife is having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Cameron regular Bill Paxton), who's masquerading as a secret agent and taking credit for all the things Harry and his partner, Al Gibson (Tom Arnold, recently in Mr. 3000), are actually doing. For a lark, Harry kidnaps Helen, plays along with the idea that Simon is actually the secret agent, and that the agency wants Helen to work for them, all as an elaborate way to get her back. Hat is, until real terrorists show up at the assignation, leading into a comedy-of-errors-style second half of the movie.<br /><br />You can see the potential, right? Even Woody Allen, the least funny man in America, could probably have gotten it right. Not so Cameron, who somewhere between T2 and True Lies really dropped the action-movie ball. (His humbling wasn't complete until the cinematic waste that was Titanic, but this was close.) Too much of the movie isn't played for the kind of laughs it should be, to the point where when it is played for laughs, it seems as if it's more the tension-relief laughter all good suspense movies need in order to keep the pace flowing. The problem is, if that was the intention, it doesn't work that way here. There's too much that could have happened and didn't, and too much that probably shouldn't have happened that did. The latter is probably the greater sin; the film runs two and a half hours, give or take a few minutes.<br /><br />Could have been great. Is run of the mill. **at did.

B0000524CY|3.0|The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen (William Friedkin, 1973/1999)<br /><br />Yes, the spider-walking scene is part of the restored footage in this film. Satisfied?<br /><br />In case you've been living in a cave for the last thirty-one years, The Exorcist is the intertwined stories of Father Lancaster Merrin (Max von Sydow), Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller), and Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair). Merrin, on a dig in Africa, sets loose the demon Pazuzu (voiced by the late Mercedes McCambridge), with whom he'd tangled some twelve years previously. Pazuzu, not too happy with being buried all that time, comes to America and chooses a random pre-adolescent, MacNeil, to possess. After some amusing attempts at medical treatment of demonic possession, Karras gets involved.<br /><br />The Exorcist has been voted the scariest movie of all time, the most controversial movie of all time, etc. I'm not sure by whom, but I suspect they were people old enough to have caught the original release in the theater. The only real scary part of the film, in fact, is the exorcism scene itself (much of the final half hour of the film), and, just as an example, Sam Raimi did a far better job of building tension during the first thirty minutes of The Evil Dead.<br /><br />Not to say that The Exorcist is not a good film. It is, in fact it's a great film. But this particular cut of it adds some things that were cut for what in retrospect were obvious reasons (the \\"subliminal\\" shots of faces and the like are cheesy enough to have been outtakes from Herschel Gordon Lewis movies), and make it less horror film and more badly-intentioned comedy. The spider-walking scene is pretty nifty, though Friedkin's original reason for cutting it was sound (it comes too early in the film, and for various logistical reasons it couldn't have been done later), and a number of the restored scenes during the setup add to the character development. In other words, had they kept the development and left out the painted face flashes, they'd probably have an excellent cut here. As it stands, either the original or the two-disc Special Edition DVD is preferable to this. Cheesy special effects knock a four-and-a-half star film on my 100 Best Films of All Time list down to ***.out the painted face flashes, they'd probably have an excellent cut here.

B00003CXI1|3.0|Although this is my favorite book in the series, its my least favorite movie in the series.  the kids obviously didn't know how to act and i really wish it was a little more like the book.  overall, its ok, but i'd rather read it than watch it.
B00008EY65|4.0|Guillermo del Toro pops up for his third American movie, and finally, he gets it right. Hellboy is a rip-roaring ride through a comic-book world on which del Toro could impose his own conventions without having to live up to a prequel (as with the mindless, utterly disappointing Blade II) or trying to make an action flick that requires suspense (as with the mindless, utterly confusing Mimic).<br /><br />In the 1940s, the Nazis, with the help of Grigory Rasputin (Karel Rodin. Also in Blade II)-- yes, that Grigory Rasputin-- try to open a portal to another dimension to summon what would be, had they been able to get the licensing, Lovecraft's Elder Gods. (I mean, come on. All those tentacles.) They fail, thanks to an American company of marines, but during the brief time the gate is open, something does come through-- an infant demon. With the marines is a paranormal advisor to Franklin Roosevelt, who takes the demon and raises it as his son. It grows up to be Hellboy (Ron Perlman, who will forever be remembered for his role in the TV series Beauty and the Beast more than anything), the crux of a division of the FBI that fights the paranormal, along with Abe Sapien, who might be better known as Fishboy (played by Doug Jones, but voiced by Frasier's David Hyde-Pierce), and a cadre of human agents. The newest of the humans is John Myers (played by newcomer Rupert Evans), and Myers and Hellboy go through the buddy-cop routine, but with a twist; part of Myers' mission is to bring pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) back into the fold. So it's a buddy-cop-love-triangle movie. With Cthulhu.<br /><br />The best part about the movie, really, is Perlman's wisecracking title character. The script puts him in some incredibly silly situations, but (and how much of this was actually scripted, how much was Perlman, we may never know) Perlman never lets Hellboy get through an absurd situation without remarking on its absurdity; for once, a truly intelligent action hero. It's about time. Add in a truly lovely nemesis in one of Rasputin's minions, the eerie Karl Kroenen (I'm sure the similarity to the name \\"Karl Rove\\" is a coincidence, but it makes the guy even eerier), a wisecracking corpse, a fish-man with a photographic memory, the potential a mini-Tristan-and-Isolde subplot (and this is really the movie's only failing; had they played that up, what fun they could have had), and John Hurt, and you've got two hours and change of out-and-out fun. Definitely worth seeing. ****truly lovely nemesis in one of Rasputin's minions, the eerie Karl Kroenen (I'm sure the similarity to the name \\"Karl Rove\\" is a coincidence, but it makes the guy even eerier), a wisecracking corpse, a fish-man with a photographic memory, the potential a mini-Tristan-and-Isolde subplot (and this is really the movie's only failing; had they played that up, what fun they could have had), and John Hurt, and you've got two hours and change of out-and-out fun.

B00005JN4O|5.0|I saw Finding Neverland last week in a special \\"sneak preview.\\" I found it amazing, and was in tears at the end.  <br />Johnny Depp is amazingly gorgeous, versatile, and is a perfect JM Barrie. Kate Winslet gives a delicate, heartwarming performance as a mother with a disease. Dustin Hoffman brought me to stitches at many times during the film with his funny deadpan lines. You will also see a familiar face from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" one of the funniest soldiers in the film is now \\"Nana\\" in \\"Finding Neverland.\\" Freddie Highmore, a young child actor gives an astonishing tearful performance as an angered child, yearning for his father.  <br />The film, with a fantastic cast, brought me to tears and laughter, and left me feeling inspired and happy at the end.
B00002RAOU|2.0|Bay of Blood (Mario Bava, 1971)<br /><br />It amuses me that Mario Bava himself hated this movie. The first thing I thought after it was over was \\"man, that was miles better than Black Sunday.\\" It's still not worth rewatching, but if you've steered clear of Bava after watching the borefest that was Black Sunday, this may entice you to at least give him another try.<br /><br />The plot, what little of it there is, is this; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake (the bay of the title). Her daughter stages a suicide, so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves. A bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident. Complications ensue.<br /><br />It's hopelessly entangled in its own plot, despite that plot not being in any way complex. It throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity (but some, at least, courtesy the lovely softcore actress Brigitte Skay), foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come. Basically, it's mindless fun. Dario Argento did it far better a few years later with Profondo Rosso; see that instead. **
B0002OERI0|5.0|A friend of mine recommended \\"American Idiot\\" to me.  And I must say, I haven't bought a Green Day album since \\"Dookie\\" (I went to the \\"Dookie\\" concert at age 14).  Now, it is ten years later, and I, taking my friend's advice, picked up their latest disc.  I was completely floored!  It has everything you could want in a CD.  You can listen to it over and over, and not just certain songs.  The whole thing is entertaining, and not only do I recommend listening to the whole album, I insist upon it.  If you miss a song, you miss an important part of Jesus'/St. Jimmy's (the main character of the \\"opera\\") life.  Never has an album reminded me so much of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\".  But with it's own complete personality, and a punk edge.  I think this album will appeal to a much wider audience for Green Day.  And, I also must add, I have noticed many \\"bad\\" reviews in regards to \\"Are We The Waiting\\".  This song may not appear as a single, but is none the less one of my favorite songs on the album.  My two favorites on the album would have to be \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\".  But, as I said before, the album is great in it's entirety.  So much so that I wrote a review here, which I have never done before.
1592400876|4.0|Lynne Truss, Eats, Shoots and Leaves (Gotham Books, 2002)<br /><br />All hail Lynne Truss, even if she does think one shouldn't be such a stickler about the Oxford Comma. (With it left out, how do YOU read a sentence like \\"I'd like to thank my parents, Alfred Einstein and Albert Schweitzer.\\"?) With thousands upon thousands of people asking why on earth punctuation matters as long as the passage is understandable, a question that reduces most sticklers to wordless fuming, Truss answers the question eloquently, in many different ways, as well as pointing out all the various peccadilloes that even the stickiest of sticklers may have glossed over, covering bits of punctuation history, and providing the book that really should be the punctuation primer in schools from here on out. Out the door with you, Mr. Warriner, Lynn Truss has written a better book that will teach more and is, to be blunt, far less dry.<br /><br />Perfect, except for that Oxford Comma bit. Love the Oxford Comma, for it shall love you back. ****
B0001DI0FI|2.0|When this film was at cinema, I almost went to see it, because all of the critics said it was so good.  Great I didn`t go.  I would have wanted my money back.  It is very boring, has no plot at all, a ship following another ship, ALL of the film. With a sort of \\"entertaining\\" battle at the beginning and a very boring and with a \\"pro-war\\" message at the end, which is the worst of the film.  There is a semi-battle in the middle.  There is no development of the characters, just in a superficial way. Quite impossible to be fond of a character of the film. Except, maybe, of the doctor, and not that much neither. <br />I am very surprised to see how many people here have reviewed well this film.  Can`t see how.  It isn`t even entertaining.  Still more surprising is that this film was made by the director Peter Weir, who directed before the good films The Truman Show and Dead Poets Society.  Really, don't waste your money and time. <br />If you want to see a war film, see a film called The Boat in its english title, though it is called the submarine in german, it seems to me.  It is about submarines and ships.  Or The thin red Line.  They are very good, and haven`t the pro-war message this one has. <br />Two stars because it may not be the worst film I have seen.
6301966988|3.0|Whoa.  GHOST is a good flick, but I'm having a hard time coping with all the metaphysical implications.  That spinning clay pot reminds me that my load of laundry is neither dry--nor clean.  And when spinning is accompanied by the Righteous Brothers, that's a recipe for supernatural confusion.<br /><br />Kind of like Dolly Parton serenading Hannibal.  Sure, it could happen, but who would believe it?<br /><br />Patrick Swayze, all four-eleven of him, steals our hearts as the lovable \\"ghost.\\"  He can do it all:  from raking a penny across a door to disrupting a money-laundering scheme.  And Demi Moore--even when she's up to her elbows in mud--is hotter than Hades.  She loves, she cries, she grieves, she believes (and now I'm out of \\"i\\" before \\"e\\" comparisons).  Yet Whoopi Goldberg provides both comic relief and clairvoyant clarity as the metaphysical agent for Swayze to extract his revenge and save his honey from the mob-hungry hordes.  Whoopi's good, she's funny, she wrinkles her nose and spits out her punch lines--but she needs to lose the hats and the Patti LaBelle outfits.<br /><br />Again, this is metaphysical stuff.<br /><br />But as I've said, I like GHOST.  Just don't understand all this supernatural stuff.  Like, when a bad guy dies, these Warner Brothers cartoons come floating out of the floor to capture said bad guy's \\"soul.\\"  The noise reminds me of my cat choking on a chicken bone.  Is all of this metaphysical?  Well, my cat doesn't think so.<br /><br />--D. Mikels
B000274THQ|4.0|This film is about a young man, who has been raised in East Germany by a mohter who believes in the sistem.  She has a heart attack and falls in a comma after seeing him in a protest.  As all the reviews say, while she is in a comma a lot of things happen, among them, the wall falls.  After she awakens, he tries to make her believe the communist sistem is still there, for the doctor has said she wouldn`t stand another heart attack.     This film is a funny comedy, not a slow one, as someone said in another review.  Didn't seem to me, at least.  Didn't notice the two hours.  It is, of course, a different sort of film, in everything, and that`s what is refreshing about it.  That`s probably because is a german film.  And this very important part of History is told from the point of view of germans.  From the point of view of people who lived it.  And of common people.  The fact that the main theme is the love of this man for his mother, and not romance (that is present also), as in most films, makes it different too, in a good way.  It is a lovely film, with lovely characters.  The main one, especially, anyone will fall in love with him.  I really recommend it.

0684800713|5.0|i must say when i started reading this book...it seemed dull at first and to some people it just may be that DULL..but really as you get further into the book you notice all the drifting of scenery and characters and moods...my god Hemingway threw all that in there and it just mixed and while reading it my imagination really felt a lil drunk with all the wine and so dizzy with all the travelling...ITS HOW GOOD HIS DESCRIPTIONS ARE that it literally takes you in...this is great work done right here...gotta luv this book the most...
B000003TB6|5.0|The Roots put the HIP in hip-hop. This album is ridiculously cool. I first saw The Roots, 2 years ago, on Chappelle's Show and I thought, \\"Yes, this is IT, this IS HIP-hop music\\" and I went out and bought \\"Phrenology\\" and enjoyed it thoroughly. And today, I finally picked up another album by this band. \\"Do You Want More?!!??!!\\" YES I DO!!! I've been in the dark about any of the other albums by the Roots, but now that I have this one, I will eventually own the entire catalog. I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! I mostly listen to jazz/blues/funk, anything with that groovin' element. When I was listening to samples of this album in the store, I couldn't believe how funkin grooven it was, then I heard the verse on \\"Mellow My Man\\" where ?uestlove drops in the swingin' jazz beat under Black Thought's rhyme, I had to purchase this. I can't wait to get more of The Roots. I could go on and on about this band. After hearing this, YOU WILL WANT MORE!!!! <br /> <br />Rhymes - 100% free of bling, bling BS, thoughtful and cool <br /> <br />Drums - Jam packed into the pocket, tight as can be, I mean, it's ?uestlove, whatta ya expect? <br /> <br />The Music - Mellow, tasteful, totally groovin
B0002OXVDW|5.0|THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT is GREAT entertainment.  Everyone, young and old should see.  It's a great way of introducing your children or grandchildren to REAL entertainment and not the junk that's out now. Makes one yearn to see almost all of the films featured in their full length versions.  While not all the numbers are winners, most of them are wonderful.  The grand daddy of them all is the first one, my favorite.  The other two have their wonderful moments as well.  I like the concept of the first and third installments the best.  Glad that so many are coming out on DVD next year....but we also need the following..SUMMER STOCK; BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY; IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER; THE PIRATE; BELLE OF NEW YORK; YOLANDA AND THE THEIF and the underated but delightful MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS.  Are you listening you people at Warners?? These films deserve to be seen by all musical lovers.  They were filmed so that you can actually see the dance numbers straight forward with none of the kinentic and quick editing i.E CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE.
6305127646|4.0|After six viewings (ok, so mainly the \\"good\\" parts, heh) I have analyzed what I loved about \\"The Saint\\".  Many of the bad reviews for this movie come from folks who seem to think it's an action flick.  Er, no. <br /> <br />It's a romance, people.  That may not be what the director/scripters originally intended, but that's the way it ended up.  A wonderful, stirring romantic origin-story that asks and answers the questions, \\"Why would someone become a professional thief?\\", and \\"Why would he change radically to become a \\"Saint\\", using his former talents for good?\\" <br /> <br />The answer, of coure, being love of a good woman.  Snicker if you must, but I still believe this can and does happen -- just with less sexy-looking people than Val Kilmer.   <br /> <br />Elizabeth Shue plays the naive physics researcher and does it well.  Some critics felt it was ridiculous that she was presented as a genius but couldn't make a public presentation without having heart palpitations.  Actually that's 100% possible, I've seen enough brilliant engineers totally fall apart at management reviews. <br /> <br />Having disposed of these objections, I will say that Val's acting skills made the movie.  Watching his body language change with his accents and hairstyles was amazing.  There is a scene where he actually \\"morphs\\", instant by instant, in voice and expression from his thief persona to \\"Thomas More,\\" the poet/artist/traveler who will steal Dr. Emma's heart.  Amazing. <br /> <br />His inner conflict was masterfully portrayed for those who notice subtlety.  He knows he can fool Emma - he HAS fooled her, completely - but then, is he \\"pretending\\" to fall in love with her or is it real?  What is real?  His self-doubts, his sudden perception of his inner emotional poverty, his impulsive decision to not steal Emma's cold-fusion notes because \\"Ahhh, I can't DO this... she's so great.\\"  No melodrama, no beating the audience over the head with it, just... Perfection.
B00016POFE|5.0|I've been into PT for some years now, and finally decided to see what the fuss was about the DVD-A - DTS version of In Absentia.  Now I can finally hear all of the little nuances that have been so carefully recorded for this outstanding album.  Furthermore, the extra tracks, Drown with Me, Chloroform, and Futile are revelations that I can't believe didn't make the album.<br /><br />Worth the price of this DVD alone are the videos for Blackest Eyes and Wedding Nails. Blackest Eyes gives the exact feeling of being at one of their recent shows, with the projected video images taking the forefront.  Most disturbing and powerful is the Wedding Nails video, which actually scared me the first time I saw it.<br /><br />Even if you don't have DVD-A capabilities, the DTS track is also at high resolution.  Buy and be mesmerized.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I too was dissapointed that the DVD set does not include all material however as far Led Zep are concerned they did not want their performance to be included because they thought it was sub standard and not worthy. <br /> <br />That being as it may it's taking 20 years to get material such as these DVD's on such a momentous world event that defined a generation is long overdue and I'll take anything!  One for the library to the younger generation.
055357342X|5.0|I feel it's important to point out that this series is so good, it should be able to penetrate the consciousness of readers of other genres, of people who are prejudiced against the fantasy genre (and perhaps rightfully so, what with all the terribly written fantasy books out there).  <br /> <br />A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE goes beyond fantasy. It is quality litterature and deserves to be treated like that. I love it.
0441003257|4.0|The New York Times reviewer calls Good Omens \\"a direct descendant of the Hitchhiker's Guide.\\" The parentage is probably right but the line of descent veers markedly after that. Neil Gaiman was 2004 Guest of Honor at Mythcon, the Mythopoeic Society's annual shindig. Their bulletin, Mythprint (Vol 41 No. 10, Oct. 2004) includes the text of his remarks on the effect of three writers on his own work: C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and G.K. Chesterton (mythsoc.org). With these muses to inspire him, it's no wonder he's become the premier fantasist across the board, from Sandman and graphic novels to co-writing Alice Cooper's rock opera, The Last Temptation, to Neverwhere and his own prolific output, to the present collaboration.<br /><br />That said, I would wish for more of the ghost of Doug Adams, but that's a given these days for anything I read (except P.G. Wodehouse, whom Adams stamped \\"the funniest writer in English,\\" Doug having a penchant for understatement). Good Omens, in case you missed the other three hundred reviews, is about an angel and a demon who decide they like earth and plot to put off Armageddon. The best characters are Crowley the demon and Aziriphale the angel. I'd gladly read a whole series of their adventures. The authors also handle the adult humans rather well, but where this book absolutely bogs down is in the bits about four kids, one of whom is the Antichrist. Neil and Terry need more cartoons in their video diet (who doesn't?). Watch Rugrats and Ed, Edd and Eddy and figure out how kids talk. Unfortunately, you can't skip these parts because the plot turns on them, lifeless and dead wood though they are. It also helps if you've seen The Omen, which the authors cannot help playing off of. All in all, this book isn't nearly as bad as most books the New York Times likes, even if it did make the bestseller list. It's also ready for Disney to pick up the movie option because of the many Queen songs Crowley plays in his car. Since Hollywood Records owns the Queen catalog, this means the film sountrack is ready to go. May I suggest another Hollywood Records property, Stryper, to kick out the jams on the angelic side? \\"Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly,\\" Chesterton once quipped. In that sense, the authors, along with the demon Crowley, find themselves on the side of the angels.wns the Queen catalog, this means the film sountrack is ready to go.

B000002H6C|5.0|they should remaster this album and rename it \\"metallica's guide to kicking a$$\\" because thats what this cd does from beginning to end.  this is my favorite metallica cd, i like it even better than master of puppets and ride the lightning, AND the black album.  all three of those are classic cds, but this album is so much more raw, and in my opinion more aggressive.  this is the most militaristic of all their cds; whenever i listen to this cd i think of bombs blowing up, machine guns, and troops marching in going to war. it makes me want to put on army boots, cammo, grab an m-16 and a few grenades and raise hell.  the only weak point that i can think of with this album is, like everyone else always says, is the fact that the bass is missing, but to be honest, i hardly ever notice it.  other than that, metallica was in top form with cd. another complaint that alot of people have with this album is the drums, especially with the bass drum sounding more like \\"tap tap tap\\" than \\"boom boom\\". i actually like the drum sound on this album, i dont know it just seems to give it a really bad a$$ effect. this is a classic album, the best one metallica ever made.  metallica kicked a$$ back then, and they still do now.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|What can I say... Here's another for the genre staple with warewoves thrown in to give it a story...<br /><br />Watching this a 2nd time, I have to say that this film was well done and the combining of two genres (vampire/warewolf) was a great idea!<br /><br />All in all, very entertaining.<br /><br />And which side are you rooting for?

B00004X01U|5.0|I am a huge Madonna fan, my favorite will always be Evita,but outside of that in my opinion, \\"Ray of Light\\" was the greatest since her first golden days of fame.  Music really captures your feeling and that is what Madonna is about......she makes you think of ex lovers LOL.  Anyway, listen to the samples and hear for yourself! American Life was the latest CD, and it totally bites., there is maybe one good song, and I only like it because I have herd it on the radio over and over until you have no choice to like it.  Remember, Amazon.com was the first web site to let you listen to samples before you buy, take advantage of that!
B00005N91B|4.0|By now most people are aware of some of the more notorious scenes in this popular 1992 movie about a murder/mystery writer (Sharon Stone) being prime suspect for a string of murders that eerily resemble the death scenes in her novels.  What some people may not know is that this movie actually has a really intriguing story.  I decided to rent this movie one night when not much else was at the rental store and I was in the mood for a mystery movie and the clerk at the rental store recommended the new unrated edition of \\"Basic Instinct\\".  At first I was skeptical, I figured it wasn't much for story, just eye-candy, and I wanted a story.  The clerk assured me that it was more than just eye-candy, this movie had an excellent story full of twists that would keep you guessing until the end, so I decided, why not give it a try.  To my surprise the movie was excellent.  Even the most notorious scene in the movie (the interrogation scene) which when talked about sounds like it was a marketing ploy to get plenty of guys in the seats, actually served a purpose in the film by showing the power Sharon's character weilded over men with her sexuality.     The acting in this movie is quite superb, especially by Sharon Stone who you never quite know if she's good or evil or simply playing the devil's advocate.  Michael Douglas also does an excellent job of playing a loose-cannon detective who is the lead investigator in the case and gets involved with Sharon's character.  The directing by Paul Verhoeven is also top-notch, possilby his best.      So, with all that being said, don't write this movie off as simply another raunchy movie with no story, give it a chance and I'm sure you'll be surprised.      \\"Basic Instinct - The Unrated Director's Cut\\" contains language, violence, strong sexuality/nudity, and drug references.
B000002H2H|5.0|When we think about Metallica, music like \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is what we should think of, regardless of what's happening now.  It is just an unbelievable album.  I think \\"Master of Puppets\\" is better, but it's undeniable that \\"Ride the Lightning\\" laid the groundwork for that album.  And that's one of my favorite things about \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" that it makes you appreciate \\"Master\\" more, highlighting their development as a band.   <br />   <br />  Another thing I really like is the production.  It's not the cleanest sound, but it shouldn't be.  \\"Ride the Lightning\\" sounds exactly like an underground metal album should.  This is unlike \\"Master,\\" whose production I think is a little bit too polished.   Maybe Metallica thought so too, and that's why \\"...And Justice for All\\" sounds like it does.  But who knows?   <br />   <br />  One thing I didn't like is that the guitar sound was kind of the same throughout the album.   <br />   <br />  But the most important thing about \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is that the songs rule.  My  favorite is \\"Creeping Death.\\"  That song just makes you feel alive.  The first four songs are classics, and really set the mood for the album, especially \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" and \\"Fade to Black.\\"  Metallica does a great job of creating a feeling of the hopelessness and inevitability of death in these songs.  But then, another thing I really like about \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is that near the end of the album, the protagonists in \\"Escape\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\"  actually win some.       <br />   <br />  And that brings us to the last song \\"The Call of Ktulu.\\"  It's a good song, but I didn't like that they basically play the same thing for eight minutes.  But what is really cool about it is the end, where it actually sounds more like what could be the beginning of a song, or an album.  I really like this effect of having the very end of an album sound more like the beginning of an album.  I'm surprised more bands don't do that.
0131177052|5.0|\\"Working Effectively with Legacy Code\\" is a very valuable resource.  The author defines \\"legacy code\\" as \\"code without tests.\\"  It doesn't matter whether the code was written last week or ten years ago.  There is more emphasis on old code that nobody understands, mainly because it is messier and harder to work with.<br /><br />The examples in the book are mainly in C, C++ and Java, but there are a couple in C# and Ruby.  While it is essential to know one of these languages, the author provides enough information to understand the others.  When a technique only applies to a certain language, it is clearly indicated.<br /><br />The author shows how different diagrams can help you learn how to understand code.  In addition to UML, there are dependency and effect sketches.  The author uses these to show how to think about understanding and refactoring.  Other tools, such as refactoring browsers and mocks are explained.<br /><br />Speaking of refactoring, there are \\"dependency breaking techniques\\" (aka refactorings) with step-by-step instructions (Martin Fowler style) throughout the book.  There are also explanations of why patterns and design rules exist.  Most importantly, there are lots and lots of cross-references and an excellent index.<br /><br />Working with legacy code isn't fun, but this book helps make it as painless as possible.  With the split emphasis between psychological/understanding/techniques and refactoring, this book is both a great read and an excellent reference.
B0002JJBZE|4.0|I still remember when Star Trek was first shown on Thursday night in 1966.  Immediately, we all knew that something new and very special was being born.  Star Trek was so far ahead of its time that it is still hard for me to believe that it ever got produced at all.  Star Trek as a series is a five-star production.  Here, in the second season the magic is still there, and most fans of Star Trek will want to snap this one up--it is great to be able to get the whole season in one fell swoop--this is a lot better deal than the earlier two-episodes-per-disk offering.<br /><br />The second season has some incredibly good episodes.  My two favorites are The Trouble With Tribbles (probably this one is almost everyone's favorite) and The Doomsday Machine.  \\"Amok Time\\" is another classic that most of us really like, and certainly there is nothing at all implausible about it.  \\"A Private Little War\\" is also an excellent episode and deals with a plausible scenario in which an innocent, less advanced culture is caught between the Federation and the Klingons.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the seeds of Star Trek's eventual demise are also evident in season two, with some very bad episodes.  I personally believe that the best Star Trek episodes are those that stick to the point of the series--what will humankind find when it ventures out among the stars, and what will the effect of this discovery be on humankind?  Those episodes that stick to this basic theme in my opinion are the good ones and those that deviate from it are the bad ones.<br /><br />Well, we ain't gonna find the Roman Empire, so I nix Bread and Circuses as a bad episode even if it was kind of interesting and funny (\\"you mess up this network's ratings, Flavius, and we'll do a special on you!\\"). \\"A Piece of the Action\\" is hilarious and enjoyable too, but again, it is not serious science fiction.  Similarly, we aren't going to find Nazis on some other planet, we aren't going to find Greek gods, we aren't going to find witches, nothing in the Gamesters episode is plausible -- the episodes that centered around this kind of nonsensical fantasy were just plain bad in my view, and I thought so at the time, back in 1967-68.  It took a lot of these bad episodes to eventually kill what is still the greatest series in television history.  One wonders why scripts this bad ever got approved.  There are many, many science fiction writers who could have written more plausible scripts about the real point of the series--what will we find out there, and what will it do to us?<br /><br />I realize that opinions will differ about the above, and that is fine, but that is my opinion.<br /><br />Happily, the Second Season still has numerous excellent episodes that make up for the above duds.  As I said, the magic is still there.<br /><br />While some have criticized the packaging of this offering, I am OK with it.  It is nice the way they include each of the original trailers with each episode, so if the title of the episode does not jog one's memory as to what the episode is about you can simply watch the brief trailer.  I found myself doing this a number of times, and frankly skipping a few of the stinker episodes (cat's paw and gamersters comes immediately to mind in this context).<br /><br />It is great that the Second Series is available at a reasonable price, so nicely packaged, and fans of Star Trek (myself included) will doubtless not be able to pass it up.mesters episode is plausible -- the episodes that centered around this kind of nonsensical fantasy were just plain bad in my view, and I thought so at the time, back in 1967-68.

0140277447|5.0|As a chinese I know this terriable event. I also know the fact that Japs have been trying to deny this event by arguing that population of Nanjing at that time is less than 300,000. Then they conclude that the whole event is fake. I can easily prove that this argument is so weak. Nanjing was the capital of china at that time. When the war was coming, lots of people live near Nanjing run to Nanjing for shelter. China was a agriculture society at that time, the rural population is much larger than city population. So it is impossible to know the real population of Nanjing when Japs conquered it. When Japs begins to kill people, they did not only kill people staied in the town, but also those people hided in villages, in temples. So the population of Nanjing at that time can prove nothing.<br /><br />China claim the 300,000 number with solid resources. As far as I remember, there are 2 major charity organizations buried part of the killed peoples. They record the amount of their work and the total amount is about 200,000. There are also huge amount of peoples were killed on the beach of the Yangzi river. their body can never be found.<br /><br />When the number of recorded dead body doesn't match the Nanjing population, it is either due to the wrong dead body amount calculation or due to the wrong population data or both. Japs claim this holocaust to be fake simply by saying that the population of Nanjing is less than the number of 300,000. This tells me and any chinese two things:<br /><br />1. They never really fell guilty about what they have done.<br /><br />2. Japs can never be our trustable neighbour.
B00003CY0V|4.0|When this movie debuted in theaters amidst some heavy criticism about lack of imagination and story, I was kind of put-off by it.  I really was wanting to see it because I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman because of the X-Men movies, and I generally cannot pass up an opportunity to watch Halle Berry, who is in my opinion one of the sexiest women in Hollywood.  So, I went against my better judgment and didn't see the movie until it came to DVD, and needless to say, the critics were way wrong. I was surprised by how good this movie was, it was well crafted and the acting was great.    The actors in the movie were excellent, John Travolta playing the villain (something he does more and more these days) was very complicated because he was bad, yet his motives weren't purely evil.  Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry, who acted together in \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United\\", were wonderful together, the sexual tension between the two was well played and very realistic. Out of the cast my favorite was Halle Berry, she really showed a new side of herself by playing a character that was ambiguous for the most part, and turned out to be bad, a part she hadn't played previously, and she seemed to enjoy playing up the sex appeal of the character, which was evident in her very popular topless sun-tanning scene. This scene is a perfect example of how sexuality can be a very powerful asset, and Halle uses her \\"assets\\" to her advantage.  Another side-effect of the topless scene was Halle's newfound courage and confidence in her sexuality that enabled her to do the critically acclaimed \\"Monster's Ball\\" and go on to win an Oscar for her powerful, raw performance.     The one complaint I have about this movie, has more to do with the DVD than the movie, is the ending, I liked the ending, that is until I watched the alternate endings in the special features, I liked one of the alternate endings more, and that's something that really frustrates me.  If the studios decide to end the movie one way, but allow you to see the alternate ending on the DVD release, and the alternate ending is more satisfactory, then you're left wanting to see it included in the movie.  The reason I wasn't as happy with the standard ending is because there isn't a great resolution to the story, Hugh Jackman's character gets his kid back but you don't know if he retained any of the money or not, from the way it ends it appears that John Travolta and Halle Berry wound up with all of the money, which wouldn't hold true to Hugh's character.  All of those items are clearly explained in the alternate ending.    \\"Swordfish\\" is rated R, for violence, language, sexuality/brief nudity.

B00005JMXX|4.0|This is a movie that wants to give the world a message, and though I am sad to say it fails to do this it is actually worth watching for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />So where do I begin?  Well for starters I'm a major fan of Ian HOLM and Adrian LESTER who played the British scientists in the film, not that they had big parts but in my opinion they were by far the best actors in the whole movie,.<br /><br />Dennis QUAID did a fair to reasonable job as the beleaguered Climatologist Jack Hall and Jake GYLLLENHAAL did well as his estranged son Sam who is trapped in New York when a tidal wave hits the city before the start of the \\"big freeze\\".<br /><br />We are given a taste of the weather to come, with falling ice the size of basket balls in Japan, and snow in New Delhi and it just gets worse which is what the film is all about.<br /><br />The film jumps from situation to situation, the trapped and doomed British Scientists in Scotland, Jack HALL trying to get to New York to his son Sam, Jack's Doctor wife looking after a dying child in a hospital and fragments of people's lives as they try to walk to safety across the frozen wasteland that is now the Big Apple.<br /><br />You can't fault the special effects, they are superb though the wolves in the zoo are a bet puppetry looking in my opinion but they give Sam and his friends a good run for their money when they go looking for antibiotics on a ship that has just floated up a New York Street, courtesy of the tidal wave.<br /><br />The plot isn't overly complex, we have the usual dumb people leaving the library when they are warned not to, ho hum, but hey we have to have few fatalities don't we along with the heroic I'll give my life up for my friends person, but like I said this is why we the General Public to the movies!<br /><br />As a pointer Glenn PLUMMER as the down and out Luther gives a solid performance, especially with his lovable dog in tow, he is by far the smartest person trapped in the library by the way; he knows what it is like to be cold and hungry in New York and his advise though on the surface is laughable, it is also very sound.<br /><br />There are some poignant scenes, such a librarian holding onto an old bible, to keep warm the library have to be burned, but he is hoping that this one book can be saved, so that civilisation can remember something about itself, that actually brought a lump to my throat which quite surprised me!<br /><br />All the same this film is an a real pot boiler of a movie with all the good ingredients to make you want to sit down and watch it, you have a love story thrown in, a family reunion, the tragic death of the President, the redemption of the Vice-President who hadn't believed the big freeze was going to happen, state of the art special effects and a pretty good sound track too, plus everything else that is going on!<br /><br />I might add that the Director has taken ideas from other movies, there is a scene where a young Japanese man is seen sitting having a drink of saki before going home when the basket ball size hailstones start to fall, he tries to get to safety, he is talking to his wife/girlfriend on the phone when he is felled and all you hear is his wife/girlfriend on the phone screaming his name.  If any of you remember the film Meteor with Sean Connery, there is a scene where a Chinese young man legs it home to try and get his family a way before the tidal wave hits, he is going to leave the family dog behind but he grabs it along with his wife and son and tries to flee but dies in the attempt.  Not the same but the concept is very similar!<br /><br />I do think there is a message in this film, quite an important one too but sadly it is lost in the Blockbuster mentality that it is liberally tarred with, for films with a message I would suggest you try watching, \\"I Heard the Owl Call my Name\\" or \\"Where the River Runs Black,\\" or \\"The Emerald Forest,\\" now those are films that have far more impact than \\"The Day AfterTomorrow\\" perhaps because they weren't made on a such massive budget and had a reasonable idea as to what audience they were catering too.t than \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" perhaps because they weren't made on a such massive budget and had a reasonable idea as to what audience they were catering too. <br />

0140277447|5.0|it reminds me my days in nanking, when I met many people whose relatives were killed by fuxking brutal Japanese.
0380778556|5.0|The book, Rebecca, was a very interesting book.  I liked how it portrayed romance and mystery and kept me guessing throughout the book.  Mrs. De Winter had to get through the trials of living up to the late Mrs. De Winter.  Her husband, Mr. De Winter, only wants a companion not a lover.  In the end, Mrs. De Winter does not feel intimidated by the late Mrs. De Winter after finding out how mean she really was during her life.  I would recommend this book to readers of all ages who like mysteries with a little romantic involvement.
0140277447|5.0|Reading these reviews are making me more and more upset.  First of all, I'm not trying to comment on Ms. Chang's journalism technique/sources/etc, because I don't have enough information to be a judge of that.  I'm also not commenting about the \\"numbers war\\" in the reviews etc., because I didn't count the bodies; therefore, I don't know.  But regardless of the discrepancies in numbers or the level of objectivity of Ms. Chang's work, the fact remains that the Japanese soldiers' atrocities against the Chinese DID happen.    I KNOW for sure that the Japanese soldiers did in fact commit many terrible atrocities against Chinese civilians, and often times in very sickeningly cruel systematic ways.  Though I am American, both my parents are from Asia, and my father was a child in China during WWII.  Ever since I was young, they've both told me about many of the horrible crimes that the Japanese committed against the Chinese during the war, as well as direct accounts that they've heard from people older than them.  (So I guess my experience was similar to Iris's...hearing oral accounts from the older generation etc.).  A lot of the atrocities that my parents told me about as a child coincided with the exact same happenings that Ms. Chang describes in the book.  And mind you, my parents are NOT communist!!  In fact, my Fathers family fought AGAINST the communist party in China, so he has no reason for spreading what many here are calling \\"communist propaganda.\\"  My experience is similar to many other second-generation Chinese people my age, in that many of my Chinese peers have parents who told them similar accounts as well.  Do you mean to tell me that my parents, the people they knew, and all my peers' parents are all communist and liars who, for some deranged reason, all want to spread random lies and propaganda about the Japanese for no good reason?  No.  That's just ridiculous!  NOT ALL CHINESE ARE COMMUNIST LIARS.  It's so unfair to consider all Chinese accounts as being propaganda based on the assumption that it's all from the Communist government.    It. Happened.  Face it.    How is it fair that according to some of these reviews, the only credible sources about the killing of Chinese are European/Western accounts & figures??  That is ridiculous...keep in mind how obviously racist & close-minded the West was in the 1940's compared to today (and even today, we have a long way to go in terms of racism & how America treats the rest of the world).  How can you ONLY trust Eurocentrically skewed outsider perspectives for Asian history?  While I'm not saying that the Chinese communist government is a very credible source, relying only on non-Asian accounts is also VERY seriously flawed.  How can you ignore all Chinese accounts when attempting to reconstruct Chinese history?    It makes me sick.  But if it makes you feel any better, TIME magazine (I think it was TIME...if it wasn't time it was U.S. news) ran an article on it a few years ago, and also acknowledges many atrocities & interviewed soldier's etc.  So there's a \\"credible\\" Western source for you.    and here's another from the San Francisco Chronicle:  \\"The Rape of Nanking, the infamous World War II siege by the Japanese Imperial Army, left Ni Cuiping with numerous scars.  The 75-year-old's traumas ranged from witnessing seven family members and relatives brutally killed to being shot in her shoulder. Now 50 years after Japan officially made peace with the United States and much of the world, Ni lives to remind people that the wounds and atrocities inflicted by Japan remain unresolved.  \\"I'm a witness to the Nanking massacre,\\" said Ni, who still lives in Nanking in China. \\"I'll never allow the Japanese government to deny history. As a witness I will testify to the last day of my life.\\"  Ni's stirring testimony at a press conference yesterday began a four-day event protesting the 50th anniversary of the San Francisco Peace Treaty.  The treaty, which is being commemorated thisweekend in San Francisco by Japanese and U.S. government officials, formally ended the war between Japan, the United States and many of its allies. It also has been cited by the Japanese government as proof that it has fulfilled its wartime obligation and is no longer liable against personal lawsuits.  But critics of Japan, including the Rape of Nanking Redress Coalition, see the anniversary as an opportunity to demand an official apology and individual compensation for war victims, sex slaves and forced laborers, something Japan has refused to do. The protest is highlighted by a conference at the San Francisco Radisson Miyako hotel called \\"Fifty Years of Denial: Japan and Its Wartime Responsibilities.\\"  Ni was among several redress advocates speaking yesterday morning. With tears in her eyes, she recalled how her family fled to the countryside outside Nanking in 1937 when the Japanese army invaded and eventually killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.  Shortly after, the army discovered her family. Her father, who was washing vegetables in a nearby pond, was the first to fall.  \\"They fired at my father and he was killed at the first shooting, I thought,\\" said Ni. \\"But they shot three more times and he died by the water.\\"  Her mother and grandfather were killed there, too, and Ni was shot in the shoulder. Later, she witnessed an uncle, two aunts and one of their unborn children killed by Japanese soldiers.  Soon Duk Kim, a speaker from South Korea, told of her experiences as one of approximately 200,000 sex slaves, called comfort women. The 82-year-old said she was 17 when she was forced to go work for the Japanese army.  Though she was originally told she would be a temporary nurse in Japan, she was instead shipped to Shanghai, where she began three years as a slave servicing Japanese soldiers. In small tents, the women were raped countless times, some fainting, others struggling violently.  \\"Every single day, the war soldiers lined up,\\" said Kim. \\"There were so many, we couldn't count them.\\"  Many girls committed suicide. Kim tried three times.  \\"I wanted to die,\\" said Kim. \\"The shock was so much, it was beyond words.\\"  She was later sent home due to medical problems but she never married because she felt she would be unacceptable to a potential husband.  \\"What I endured and experienced, I cannot forget,\\" said Kim. \\"Every bit of it is inscribed in my memory.\\"\\"    R.I.P Iris Chang, and all those who died and have been forgotten.    ****EDITED LATER TO ADD:  Unfortunately, I feel that this review site has somewhat degenerated into extremes & simplistic offensive comments all around, especially because the set up does not allow reviewers to respond directly to other reviewers' comments for clarification and intelligent discussion.    In any case, I, as a Chinese person, find it very offensive that many of the Japanese soldiers and the government responsible for the atrocities are denying them to this day and even go so far as to attempt to distort history and portray themselves as victims rather than aggressors. That makes me sick. The damage caused was bad enough, but to so blatantly deny it afterwards is just completely inexcusable and very nauseating to me.    But on the other hand, I am also extremely against racism. While these atrocities (which certainly extend beyond Nanking) against Chinese (and other Asian) civilians WERE indeed committed by Japanese soldiers in WWII, this DOES NOT mean that ALL Japanese are barbaric, evil, soulless, *insert extreme negative adjective here* people. It is important to hold the guilty individuals and government system accountable for their war crimes, but it is ALSO important to not make racist blanket statements about the Japanese people as a whole. There are cruel, cowardly people in EVERY race, and to single out the Japanese race as the epitome of this very HUMAN flaw is simply unfair, unreasonable, illogical, and hypocritical. The events were a horrific example of the epitome of human cruelty and sadism, and the events were caused by Japanese soldiers, but again, it is important to emphasize the difference between innocent Japanese people as a race, and those guilty of the atrocities & coverup. This is just a reminder for the need to be clear in distinguishing between the guilty and the innocent.    But aside from that whole debate, the most important thing for me is that...I truly hope that the dead and the victims will see justice done.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is witty, smart, and most of all, HUMAN. This isn't one of those Hollywood movies where today's exceptionally beautfiul stars prance around a movie set and \\"pretend\\" to give heart-felt performances. 'Napoleon Dynamite' showcases raw emotion, a simple script, and wonderful comic timing. Don't be surprised if, in a few years, a bunch of people come together for the first Napoleon Dynamite convention, complete with \\"Vote For Pedro\\" T-shirts!
B0000025C0|5.0|Don't Look Back is another solid album by Boston, along with their debut album. If you're looking to buy a Boston album, buy this one and their debut album. You won't be disappointed. Both are excellent examples of classic rock.

All seven songs are excellent; you won't find any filler here. <br /> <br />I'm not kidding, this is probably the greatest debut album ever made by any band. From top to bottom, Boston is solid. I'd give it 10 stars if that was possible. I definitely recommend Boston and Don't Look Back. <br />   <br />
B0002IQHY8|4.0|I have each and every Parsons/Parsons Project album on CD, and this one is a great addition to the catalog. It's very modern-sounding; Parsons continues to change with the times, and he's able to make albums that not only fit well with the rest of his releases, but also stand alone as solid accounts of current music trends.

B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie is really good. It stays true to the essence of the book while still incorporating new ideas and looks for things. I mean really, what's the point of having a movie follow the book EXACTLY? The vast majority who go to see these films HAVE read the books already, and if they haven't they won't know the difference anyway. <br /> <br />I think this movie is great because of the artistic license taken with it. It's not a carbon copy of the book, so it's as if you see a brand-new yet still very familiar story. I also like how it also speaks more to a older audience. I mean, all the original HP fans (like me) are a lot older now than they were when the first books came out. I'm nearly 18 now, and still big a fan. <br /> <br />I do wish they had put in the Marauders storyline, but I understand what the director said about how with the way they're making the movies, it can fit in better later in the series. I also respect the director's decisions on the other ommisions made, we all knew that they'd have to cut the story a bit. <br /> <br />I can understand how younger kids may start losing their innocent enjoyment of the movies at this point, but the books ARE the same way. Nobody can even TRY to convince me that The Order of the Phoenix was written for an audience the same age as the one for Sorceror's Stone. Face it, the series involves the kids growing up. Therefore, as they get older it only stands to reason that the storylines and everything will evolve and grow as well, becoming more suitable for slightly older audiences. <br /> <br />Really, this movie is a brilliant addition to the Harry Potter series and I'm proud to have it at the top of my Christmas wish list. It is a purely magical film from beginning to end. We get to see all the old familiar cast, minus Richard Harris (may he rest in peace, he really WAS Dumbledore), as well as some great new additions. I'm sure finding someone new to play Headmaster Dumbledore was very difficult, and even though itwill never be the same, I think they made a pretty good choice. All the Hogwarts students are much more mature and grown up now, and it's definitely reflected in their acting. It was fun to see. <br /> <br />Parents should be aware that the books do evolve and mature as the series continues, and the movies should be expected to do the same. If you haven't seen it and have any doubts, then my advice would be to simply rent it or borrow it from a friend so that you can watch it before you buy and before letting your young children see it. <br /> <br />I don't think there should be much of a problem with this one though, I don't think it's too much darker than the last one. The 4th and 5th are bound to be much darker than this one is. I think anyone who read the books knows what I mean, there's no way that they could cut the darkness out of those and leave the story intact. Therefore, if the maturity and darkness of this one is starting to concern you, I would advise you to take great caution with future HP movies as well.
B00003CXCT|1.0|These  DVDs   are  NOT  the  originals  but  does that really matter...when  the   actual  screenplay  is  so  bad  that it  is  hard to figure  out  just  WHY  anyone  is  good  or  bad....   They are just presented  and  gussied up  but  there is  absolutely  no  motivations   or  sense... the  additions  are ludicrous -   especially these days  after  witnessing  the Lord of the Rings  achievements  .   The  much praised  music  is  warmed over  Stravinsky,  Wagner,  Brahms, Puccini,  etc....   one wonders   if  John Williams  has  any sense of shame......    The characters of  Leia  and  Han  are  irritating  and  Mark Hamill is  such a bad actor  standing  next to Alec  Guinness -     -  one more thing -  i don't  recall   that  it  was so difficult  to understand  many of the lines -  this  smudging  of sound  is  a disgrace
B00008K78M|5.0|Her voice and style are wounderful. A great singer in a great performance. But what sets this dvd apart of many others is the quality that's behind the show. You can see that the cameramans are professionals, not just some kids got togeather to film their frends, but people that does this work as a full time job, and that are talented and has taste. The lights, the sound, the mix, the cut, are all done at a really good level. Unfortunately too many shows (even of big names) are sooooo ugly and lame on the screen that many times it's better to turn the tv off, and only listen to the music. But this is really not the case with Laura Pausini Live. Buy it if you like to see a nice work!
1582432678|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time.  To be honest, I'm not literary enough to comment on the book's strengths.  But I did want to comment on some of the criticisms in the Amazon reviews.  Namely, that (1) the book is a novel, NOT a dissertation on teen mass murderers and (2) an unlikeable protagonist does not automatically mean the book isn't any good.  Eva's failings are part of what makes the story so haunting.   <br /> <br />I agree, that it distracted from the realism of the story that Kevin's problems were not addressed more aggressively by his parents, but his mother's negative, judgemental version of events had the benefit of hindsight.  There really aren't that many SPECIFIC instances of obviously deviant behavior (although there are some).  And in one case, Kevin is vindicated and his mother is shown to have judged him too harshly.
B00003CXTG|5.0|\\"Pearl Harbor\\" (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor -- a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941.<br /><br />It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the dramatic-romantic part of the story BETTER be good, and it is -- and it's believable too (except for the premature sex part, which inaccurately transfers modern sex morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we see some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. Believing him to be dead, his girlfriend (Kate Backinsale) and best friend (Josh Hartnett) spend a lot of time together and naturally develop a relationship; but ***SPOILER ALERT*** Rafe miraculously survives, which leads to some more action ***END SPOILER***.<br /><br />Many criticize the acting and dialogue of the drama, but I found nothing wrong with it. In fact, I found it quite well done and realistic. For instance, the film shows that Danny (Hartnett) was abused by his father while growing up. Later while dancing & drinking Evelyn (Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny seems to be while Danny is shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him and he therefore lacks confidence. This is REAL, my friends. Much later, after it is believed that Rafe is dead, Danny goes to Evelyn's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, \\"You're such an idiot!\\" This is good, realistic stuff.<br /><br />The film also shows that the timid average-looking man (Danny) can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man (Rafe). It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.<br /><br />As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? -- Go ahead and state them. Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right -- Oh my God!!), but what film ever has everything 100% right? They for certain got the gist of the event right, what more do you want? Get a life.<br /><br />You want accuracy? The subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the winning Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story. Research it, it's a fascinating story.<br /><br />The film is also respectful of the Japanese' viewpoint as they plan, prepare for and carry out their attack. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression.<br /><br />There's also a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.<br /><br />After the attack I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.<br /><br />I never even knew about this bold bombing mission until I saw this movie. It took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in U.S. military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. 16 modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashlandor bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. They paid dearly for helping, however, as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! What evil bastages!! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the film and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.<br /><br />Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the film, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the movie showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? It caused American moral to soar from the depths to which it had plunged after Pearl Harbor. It has the very same effect on modern viewers.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for \\"Pearl Harbor\\" to stumble and fail, but it never happened -- there's not one misstep. Yes, the viewer has to be open to and patient with the opening drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I d have zero interest in seeing the \\"Transformers\\" films, but this is fine movie-making. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.<br /><br />GRADE: Aor bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is.

If you enjoyed \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" then check this film out. Don't listen to the moronic critics who have mindlessly jumped on the bandwagon to bash \\"Pearl Harbor\\" just because it's the 'hip' thing to do. Besides, these critics are no doubt closet admirers of \\"Jackass: The Movie\\" (giggle). What's that tell ya?    Lastly, if \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is such a dog of a film how could it possibly make $450 million worldwide and rank with the most financially successful films of all time? (Then again the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films are all hugely successful, so this in itself doesn't prove much. Still, it says SOMETHING).

B000001FTQ|4.0|U2 capitalized on the popularity of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" to get out this EP in 1985. \\"Wide Awake in America\\" takes its name from the key track, a nearly 8 minute live version of \\"Bad.\\" One of the centerpiece tracks from \\"...Fire\\" this song has excellent dynamics that build layers of guitars (even live!?)with some sequencers and fine bass and drum performances by Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. Bono's vocal is outstanding.<br /><br />\\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" is a stripped down version, and I like how the different guitar melody drives the tune. It's amazing how well Bono's voice holds up compared from studio to live tracks.<br /><br />After the two live tracks are two outtakes, \\"Three Sunrises\\" and \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" which can also be found on the Best of 1980-1990 Limited Edition B-side disk.<br /><br />\\"Three Sunrises\\" features a cool guitar melody and some excellent Bono/Edge harmonies. This song seems stuck between the \\"War\\" and \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" sound which is probably why it didn't make a regular release. Still, I like it.<br /><br />\\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" also harkens back to early U2. The bassline is kind of cool, but the melody doesn't really stick with you.<br /><br />With a total running time of only around 20 minutes, this is definitely an investment for those wanting to complete their catalog, or for live enthusiasts.
B000063UR1|2.0|After reading many of the review's that people have given, I come to one conclusion!  Sometimes a 5 cent cigar is just a 5 cent cigar.  I have seen this movie several times, it was never meant to be a 'classic' or anything other then what it is (was), a movie to entertain for that time.  I had more than a passing interest in seeing the movie.  The set used to make it was a old U.S. Navy ship by the name of the USS Valley Forge.  In 1969, while traveling in convoy to Hawaii with many other ships, mine included, it ran into another ship, mine.  So, I do remember it well. <br />Being a Sci-Fi fan (nut), I really enjoyed this film, as I do many others, but please, when you watch this movie, DO NOT compare it by today's standards.  It was a good movie for it's time, yes, flawed and dated, but still fun to watch and remember.
B0002W4SWC|4.0|Before Bridget Jones's Diary was released in theatres, much was made of the casting of soft-spoken American (from Texas no less!), Renee Zellweger as the very British Bridget Jones. It was seen as almost heresy by fans of Helen Fielding's very popular book of the same name. To almost everyone's surprise, Zellweger pulled it off with a credible British accent and a real commitment to the role (she even put on weight). Now, on the eve of the new Bridget Jones movie-The Edge of Reason, Miramax has gone back to the well with a brand new Collector's Edition DVD that promises new extras but is it really worth the double-dip?<br /><br />There is an audio commentary with director Sharon Maguire. She comes across as soft-spoken but delivers an informative track as she talks at length about making the movie, praises her cast and discusses translating the book to the big screen.<br /><br />One of the new extras to this DVD is \\"The Young and the Mateless (an expert's guide to being single).\\" It examines the single women scene with soundbites from successful stories, like the editor-in-chief of Allure magazine and a writer from Sex and the City.<br /><br />\\"The Bridget Phenomenon\\" is another new extra that looks at the success of the movie and how it perfectly epitomized single womanhood. There are interviews with Maguire and the cast with footage from the new movie. This is a nice look at the appeal of the Bridget Jones character.<br /><br />\\"Behind-the-Scenes Featurette\\" is a slightly cheeky take on the standard promotional press kit with interview soundbites from the cast and crew mixed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />Another new extra is \\"Portrait of the Makeup Artist,\\" which features a profile on Graham Johnston who did the make-up for both Bridget Jones movies.<br /><br />There are also four TV spots advertising the movie which is new to this DVD.<br /><br />Seven deleted scenes totaling 11 minutes in length include an embarrassing marketing presentation that Bridget does for a book. There is also a nice scene between Bridget and her dad (Broadbent). Also of interest is an epilogue of sorts that is a sly homage to When Harry Met Sally (1989).<br /><br />There is also a theatrical trailer for the new Bridget Jones movie, The Edge of Reason.<br /><br />Fans of the original Helen Fielding columns are in for a treat as a collection of several of them from various years are included. They range from originals that inspired the first movie to more recent ones that make up the bulk of the second movie.<br /><br />A new extra to this DVD is \\"A Guide to Bridget Britishisms\\" that features clips from the movie explaining common British slang, like \\"fanny about\\", \\"daft\\" and \\"wanker.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there are five reviews of the first movie from the likes of Rolling Stone, USA Today and Roger Ebert.<br /><br />Fans who have the first DVD that was released might want to hold on to it as the music videos by Shelby Lynne and Gabrielle are not included on this new one.<br /><br />Bridget Jones's Diary is much more than just the quintessential single woman's survival guide. It is a funny and engaging romantic comedy that champions a more realistic image of women. Bridget Jones is the photo negative of The Sex and the City women. She is not like them, with their perfect shoes and witty repartee. Bridget would be watching that show and not be on it. And this is part of the appeal of this movie to the average woman. This DVD is quite good. The new extras are entertaining but probably not worth buying the DVD over again unless you're a die hard Bridget fan.n that Bridget does for a book.

B0002YLC24|3.0|I was prepared to give this nice movie 5 stars...until I saw the 10 minute \\"making of\\" feature on the dvd. I got sick to my stomach when I saw that our two beautiful actors apparently don't have time enough in their lives to visit the dentist. No wonder they didn't kiss each other! Other than that, this is a wonderful film. I hope they make another one!
1559408855|5.0|I must admit that I approached this movie with trepidation, having heard and read so much about it. After having watched it, I must tip my hat to the late Pasolini, for I think it takes great talent to make a movie about human perversions without resorting to cheap shock. The cinematography is mesmerising. The sets are minimal. The dialogue is charmingly warped. The acting is superb. Compare Salo with Tinto Brass' Caligula. Both movies were about mankind's dark side, but I felt dirty and debased after watching the latter. Tinto, who is definitely not in the same league as other Italian filmakers like Pasolini, Fellini or Antonioni (and never will be I assure you) first left nothing to the imagination, and then gave the audience some more. On the other hand, Pasolini's Salo is like a lotus - a flower that dares to be beautiful in the face of adversity. This review is based on the Criterion Laserdisc.
0345308239|5.0|While probably not one of Tuchman's better work, it is never-the-less noteworthy and pleasing in that the author has gone to great lengths to present her case.  I like well researched books, and even though I may not be in agreement with some of her conclusions (which I am not), I admire her tenacity in making her point.  The book was a easy read, as most of her works are and quite informative.  Like me, you may not agree with all of her conclusions, but you will have to admit that she does give you food for thought and a door into which you can view a historical event through a bit of a different angle.  Even though this was not my favorite of Tuchmans many works, it is still a valued addition to my collection and I do recommend it.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Although I'm a life-long Conservative Republican, I'm also an American, and I recognize that \\"The American Way\\" has not only allowed but actually SUPPORTED the right to say what's on your mind.  It was Voltaire who said \\"I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.\\" And that philosophy heavily influenced Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers.  More than any other nation in history, America is a country where the rights and beliefs of the citizens - even those who disagree- are protected.<br /><br />If you believe that Michael Moore is a big fat liberal nutcase, you have every right in America to believe that. If you offer any opinion on \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" when you haven't even SEEN it - you're showing off your ignorance, and in America I get to believe that too.<br /><br />Certainly Michael Moore made the movie to bash George W. Bush and to prevent his re-election.  But not only is his right to do that protected in America, (And I thank God every day to live in a country with rights like ours) but Mr. Moore brings up some very legitimate concerns.<br /><br />When the first plane hit the first Trade Center Tower on September 11th I heard about it on the radio immediately and I remember thinking \\"isn't that odd? Maybe somebody was impaired - pilot had a heart attack or something....\\" But this report was followed minutes later by the crash into the 2nd Tower and I immediately knew \\"this means a terrorist attack of LARGE proportions\\".  The President received this word while he was sitting in front of an elementary school class, and I've heard that his explanation for his actions were that he \\"didn't want to alarm the children\\".  I'm ALL for not alarming children any more than they need to be - but when you're the President and your country is being attacked on a scale that you don't know of yet - I think it's okay to say \\"sorry kids, I need to go be President - I know you'll understand\\"..... or something like that.  Instead, Mr. Bush just sat there - for seven minutes.  Not the ideal response from my Commander-In-Chief.<br /><br />Mr. Moore also makes a pretty convincing argument that ties between Middle Eastern Oil, the Bin Laden family and the White House don't look very good.  Perhaps things are utterly innocent between the Bushes and the Saudi's.... but members of the military are taught to not only do no wrong, but also to not do anything that has even the APPEARANCE of wrongness.  This movie has it's own agenda, but I give Mr. Moore credit for skillfully highlighting the appearance of impropriety.<br /><br />His editing and writing are skillful, and he has a real knack for catching folks at inopportune moments.  I like the moment when he is standing across the street from the Saudi embassy - far away from the White House - when the White House Secret Service suddenly pulls up and asking what they're doing there.  Mr. Moore seems to politely say \\"we're just here shooting a documentary, and part of it is about Saudi Arabia.... I didn't know that the secret service guards foreign embassies.\\" \\"Not usually\\", the secret service guy replies.  \\"Do they give you much trouble - the Saudis?\\" Michael Moore asks.  \\"No comment\\" - the officer says.  \\"I'll take that as a 'Yes'\\", Moore concludes. It couldn't have gone better for Michael Moore if he had staged it himself.<br /><br />For those who say \\"don't watch this!!!!\\" I say: Why not?  It's not obscene. It doesn't threaten national security or my religion.<br /><br />Coming away from this film my thought was \\"I'm not certain Mr. Bush is doing the best job that he could as President.\\"  And I don't feel disrespectful or unpatriotic to want my President to do the best job he (or she!) could.  I remain hopeful - hopeful enough that I still voted for Mr. Bush in the recently completed election.<br /><br />You can disagree with Michael Moore.  But please don't try to say that he doesn't have a right to say what he likes.  Thomas Jefferson and I would disagree.
B0002YLC24|4.0|What ever happened to Jesse and Celine after they walked and talked the night away in Vienna in \\"Before Sunrise\\"?  Apparently that question preoccupied not only director Richard Linklater and his co-writer Kim Krizan, but Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who played Jesse and Celine, as well, because all four of them worked on the script for \\"Before Sunset.\\"  It is nine years later and although Jesse and Celine promised to meet again in Vienna six months later, they did not.  But Jesse has written a best-selling novel about the night he spent with Celine and on the final stop of a European tour promoting the book he turns around and discovers her standing there.  Of course, they have to talk, and while they have a lot to say to each other the catch is that he has a flight back to America that night.  This time their conversation has to be over before the sun sets.<br /><br />\\"Before Sunset\\" is not just the counterpart to \\"Before Sunrise\\" because it represents the day the way the original represents the night.  In 1995 these two were young, on the threshold of life where all things are possible.  Now, in the light of day, they can look at both their past and their present, as if there was not a nine-year gap in the conversation.  Again we are treated to lengthy takes where the camera shows Jesse and Celine talking, talking while walking, talking while in the back of a taxi, talking while sitting, but talking all the time.  Again we find ourselves wondering if there really is a script or if Hawke and Delpy are just making it up as they go along.<br /><br />The conversation gets around to the big questions (who did or did not show up six months later and who is or is not married with kids) but as easy as it is to talk it takes a while to get the nerve to be able to hear the answers, especially since that leads to the elephant in the room: did they make a big mistake by not ending up together?  \\"Memories is a good thing if you don't have to deal with the past,\\" she says at a particularly insightful moment, but Jesse and Celine have to deal with both.<br /><br />There is a moment early in the film, when Jesse is being interviewed about his book, whether he correctly characterizes his audience as being divided into three parts regarding the ambiguous ending of his novel, which apparently ends just like the first movie.  There are those convinced the young couple got back together, those who know they never say each other again, and those unable to make a choice.  But because \\"Before Sunrise\\" was such an intimate film, \\"Before Sunset\\" is not burdened by the overwhelming expectations faced by Alexandra Ripley when she wrote \\"Scarlett,\\" the sequel to \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" that had to find a convincing way of getting Rhett and Scarlett back together on another day.  Fortunately, Jesse and Celine are life size, which is why their story has captivated so many of those who managed to actually see \\"Before Sunrise.\\"<br /><br />\\"Before Sunset\\" is different from most other sequels because it was not made to capitalize on the financial success of the original.  \\"Before Sunrise\\" made $5,535,405 in the U.S. ($22,600,000 worldwide), which is probably what \\"The Incredibles\\" made before sunset last Friday when it opened.  \\"Before Sunset,\\" which cost four times as much to make, made $5,792,822 in the U.S.  But the writers/actors obviously cared about the characters as much as the viewers who captivated those who say the original film.  That was a story that refused to follow the predictable male fantasy (as articulated by Celine) of an American boy meeting a French girl on train, having sex with her, and then never seeing her again. But \\"Before Sunrise\\" took the road not usually taken and this 2004 film follows suit.  It is more of the same, but it is not, and for most people who have been looking forward to this sequel it was worth the wait.at a particularly insightful moment, but Jesse and Celine have to deal with both. <br /> <br />There is a moment early in the film, when Jesse is being interviewed about his book, whether he correctly characterizes his audience as being divided into three parts regarding the ambiguous ending of his novel, which apparently ends just like the first movie.

0800141660|4.0|I have heard the complaint that Emma Thompson was too old to play Elinor.  Incredible!  With the abundance of 50+ male actors playing action leads, I find this type of criticism out of place!  I liked Thompson's version of Elinor because I have never met an eighteen year old with the good sense that Elinor had.  It made sense to have Elinor a little older, because she is so wise, so practical, so insightful that no teenager could possibly display all those things.  I felt that this \\"Elinor\\" was a close friend.  I have always admired the Elinor character from the book because to live life, you can't always say or express what you really feel - it's not expedient.  Many times pure emotion makes a bad situation worse.  Elinor knew that.  She felt all that Marianne felt; however, she knew her actions would adversely affect other people and could worsen the situation.  She acted accordingly.  She used her head, but she did not lack heart.  Thompson conveys all this extremely well.  On a scale of 1 to 10, Emma Thompson receives a 10 from me. <br /> <br />Kate Winslet was a tremendous Marianne.  Marianne was as an idealist, yet comes to learn that realism too has value.  She learns there should be a time for both things in life.  Winslet portrayed Marianne's coming of age beautifully.  Marianne realizes that more than attraction is needed in marriage; friendship, respect and esteem are what make a person endure through life's hardships; that is what makes a relationship last.  This fact was very well presented in Winslet's performance.  Another 10. <br /> <br />I enjoyed Hugh Grant's performance as Edward.  Grant did not play Edward as a weak man; he played him as a mild, honorable man who had made a bad decision and was paying the consequences of that bad decision.  Well done. <br /> <br />I have never seen anything done badly by Alan Rickman yet, and never hope to.  His adaption of Colonel Brandon was excellent.  He played a man who had faced a great deal of disappointment in life, and yet, was not left bitter by it.  When he saw Marianne's idealism, he remembered his idealistic days and loved her for her possession of that quality.  I think that's terribly romantic.  Rickman did it well. <br /> <br />Imogen Stubbs was excellent as the nasty Lucy Steele.  It must have been an incredibly fun part to do!  Sly, malicious little devil! <br /> <br />Now about what I didn't agree with in the film.  I do not understand why the scene between Willoughby and Elinor during Marianne's illness never takes place in this movie!  It's pivotal in the book.  It explains so much!  Ten minutes should have been added to the movie. <br /> <br />Also, Lady Middleton should have been left in the script.  She rounds out the cousins that are well meaning, but difficult to live with.  She is also the driving force behind having Lucy stay at the Middleton's country home and bringing Lucy to town. <br /> <br />However, the movie was a very good one and should receive high accolades from all.  The casting was excellent, the acting was of high quality, and the direction well done.  Buy the movie, it's worth it!
B000001EAQ|4.0|When word got out in early 1997 that U2 was about to release a \\"techno\\" album, curiosity was piqued and axes were whetted. On its release, POP suffered the sort of lambasting the band hadn't received since RATTLE AND HUM some nine years before, and quite undeservedly so. \\"Fans\\" complained that it didn't sound like U2; critics countered that it sounded too much like U2, rather than a complete makeover. What no one seemed to appreciate was that this album, uneven though it may be, followed very much in U2's career-long tradition of mixing new and different genres into its own trademark sonic stew, thereby guaranteeing something unprecedented with each new release. As such, POP is indeed a classic U2 album, with elements of techno and lots of other stuff sewn in; and if it's not simply a remake of ACHTUNG BABY, nor another faceless platter of navel-gazing Eurobeat sound effects, that's all to the good. It's also worth mentioning here that POP is a singular achievement in sonic manipulation and processing, one of the finest examples of the use of the studio as an instrument since the mid-seventies heyday of Pink Floyd. <br />   \\"Discotheque\\" is as strong an opener as U2 has ever offered - big, brash, dance-crazy and hypnotically underpinned by a lethal two-chord guitar riff which maintains emotional suspension for the entire length of the song. The lyrics are likewise ambiguous, a satire on the European club set of the 1990s but one delivered with a straight face. \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" sets some of U2's most overtly sexy lyrics to a deep, gut-grabbing bass track and tastefully employed effects. \\"MOFO\\" is the most unrepentantly technoish item here, a maelstrom of synthesisers and filtered guitars, reaching one climax after another right up until its heavenly \\"Show me, mother\\" ending. Taking a breather, the band offers a pleasant ballad with \\"If God Will Send His Angels.\\" A vaguely carnivalesque soundstage adds some uncertainty to this otherwise relatively mainstream track, with the keening \\"Staring at the Sun\\" following effectively on its heels. \\"Last Night on Earth\\" brings in some ballsy rock with a wall-shaking chorus and spot-on bass work from Adam Clayton. \\"Gone,\\" another supercharged rocker, is quite possibly U2's single greatest song, bar none, which I suppose leaves me nothing to add. <br />   As many people have already pointed out, POP was never properly completed, and had to be rushed out following two missed deadlines. The latter part of the album, it must be admitted, suffers accordingly, though there are still some bright spots on the way to the end. \\"Miami\\" is pretty iffy, an apparently half-formed paean to that pastel metropolis with some mediocre guitar-gunning for atmosphere. \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" has the potential to be POP's most effective parody of...well, pop, but meanders where it ought to swagger. \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" is a slow and moody piece that ultimately overstays its welcome. \\"Please\\" works quite well, however, bringing the Irish troubles back to U2's catalogue after nearly fifteen years and adding some tight, tough drumming from Larry Mullen. \\"Wake Up, Dead Man,\\" despite its interesting folk countersong, is one reference to Jesus too many - indeed, if POP's detractors are right about anything it's the album's lyrics, which with a few exceptions (\\"Gone,\\" \\"Discotheque,\\" \\"Please\\" and \\"MOFO\\" among them) are a considerable letdown after the brilliant observations of ACHTUNG BABY and the sly epigrams of ZOOROPA. That said, however, there's no denying that POP is, at its best, as good as anything U2 has ever released, nor that as of this writing it remains, along with ZOOROPA, the repository of the group's most searching music.
0140277447|5.0|We cannot forget the history, or it will repeat.  Everyone's life is important.  Japanese government should make a formal apology for the horrible things they did in China.  I cannot imagine why it is so hard for Japanese to admit the things they did and to say \\"sorry\\" seriously, unless they don't care or don't want to correct at all.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I'm from the UK, hence I have seen the film prior to the US release date. <br />The criticism I have seen of this film is that it doesn't follow the book closely enough.  Maybe not, but its a charming, funny and very sweet movie.  All the characters you love are back, the 2 boyfriends, her family and her friends (though I still feel the friends should get more airtime). <br />There are many cringeworthy moments, never better than when she gets arrested (I wont give anything away) and the film doesn't let up.  I literally giggled and belly laughed from start to finish.  There are many 'moments' - the Thai 'Like A Virgin' prison scene for exmaple is hilarious. The acting is excellent, and the best performance without a doubt is from Hugh Grants caddish character! Brilliantly wicked. <br />My criticism of the first Bridget Jones, was that it was so 'twee', it portrayed the Uk in that postcard perfect image, which it certainly isn't (eg: London looking beautiful during the Christmas snowfall - the reality is black slush and hardly any snow at Christmas anyway!), and whilst there are a couple of moments like that this time round, its not so prevalent. (But thats a small gripe). <br />A very funny, heartfelt and sweet movie, and I think an excellent sequel, irrespective of how close to the book it is.   <br /> <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|1) \\"The Genesis\\" - An intro to the album with a clip of Nas' verse from 'Live At The BBQ', this is a nice way to start off the album. <br /> <br />2) \\"N.Y. State Of Mind\\" - Produced By DJ Premier - This track is fire. Nas spits two crazy verses here and Premo provides a sick beat and samples Rakim on the hook and it fits the lyrics perfectly. Crazy track. <br /> <br />3) \\"Life's A Bitch\\" featuring AZ - Produced By L.E.S. - While the world was just being introduced to Nas at this point, this is the first we would hear of AZ, and all I can say is, damn. AZ spits fire on the first verse and in my opinion outshines Nas here, but both come with ill verses. If you have heard any of the songs these two have done together, you know they always come correct. Another classic track. Another note on this song is that Olu Dara provides a trumpet solo at the end here to finish off this hot song. <br /> <br />4) \\"The World Is Yours\\" - Produced By Pete Rock - The heat keeps coming here as Nas comes with three dope verses and Pete Rock provides a classic beat. It's really hard to choose only one best song on this album but this might be it. This is a classic. <br /> <br />5) \\"Halftime\\" - Produced By Large Professor - Large Professor provides Nas with an older sounding break beat. This might turn off some people who are used to newer produced beats that everyone has nowadays, but just listen to the lyrics on this track and you'll be satisfied. <br /> <br />6) \\"Memory Lane\\" - Produced By DJ Premier - This might be getting a little redundant, but this is another classic track. Premo laces this track with a crazy beat, and Nas complements the beat with some more great lyricism. One of the standout tracks on the album right here. <br /> <br />7) \\"One Love\\" - Produced By Q-Tip - This is a hot track, as Nas spits verses in the form of letters he wrote to his boys locked down. He explains what has been going on in Queens while they were in prison. A nice cpncept here and again, Nas comes with ill lyrics. <br /> <br />8) \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\" - Produced By Large Professor - A slower paced beat here provided by Large Professor, and Nas lays down some nice lyrics to complement the beat, another very hot track. <br /> <br />9) \\"Represent\\" - Produced By DJ Premier - Again, it's Premo, so you know the beat is hot. And agin, Nas drops ill verses to go with the beat. It may sound repetitive, but again, this is a dope track. <br /> <br />10) \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" - Produced By Large Professor - This is a great way to end this classic album. Large Professor drops a dope beat, and Nas ends the album with a bang with some very hot lyrics. This is another classic right here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall: <br />Beats: 9.5/10 <br />Lyrics: 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />I praised this album enough already, if you don't have it and you like hip-hop, or you simply like music, first, you are ten years late, but better late than never. This is one of the greatest albums in the history of hip-hop
1401301010|3.0|Parallel lines never intersect, do they? <br /> <br />I have been a RHCP fan since Freaky Styley. I think that the CPs are the best band ever. Anthony Kiedis is someone I have always been drawn to and admire as an artist. I admire his lyricism and lifestyle... to a certain extent. This book tends to turn me away from AK as a person simply because he decided to co-author an autobiography that skips out on his spiritual nature, his self as an artist, and the sensitive and understanding part of his nature. Instead, he comes across as a 100% self-centered drug addict, with nothing other than sex on his mind. This book was really cool in the way that it described the origin and the creation of the band, and the trials and tribulations/efforts that went into making it all happen. But when you read the book, you get the sense that Whoever Whatsadilly who helped him write this, weeded-out the philosophical and deep nature of AK, and made it consumable for the average poo bear. I don't know AK. I have never met him. But I feel that through RHCP's songs and his lyrics, there is a whole 'nuther person that I do know, and that was purposefully kept behind the veil.  <br /> <br />I mean, come on... didn't his co-writer also write for Howard Stern, or something??? <br /> <br />Good read for any RHCP fan. <br /> <br />

B00005JMUL|4.0|First off, Robert Zemeckis is one of the most creative movie minds in the business.  He has always been way ahead in movie technology.  Whether it was Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has always been where the future technology is.  And the same goes for The Polar Express, which is a visual masterpiece... and an okay story.      This children's Christmas story is about boy named Billy, who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  So on Christmas Eve, a train named The Polar Express comes to pick him up and takes him on a journey to the North Pole. There he meets Santa Claus and believes in the Christmas spirit once again.  Thats basically the gist of the story.    As stated earlier, the visual effects are amazing in this movie.  Zemeckis used a motion capture device, the same thing that video game creators use in sports games.  Everything from the train ride to the design of the North Pole (which is the best visual part of the movie) is purely amazing.  Also, Tom Hanks (oh yeah, he's in the movie) plays five different characters.  Everyone from Billy to the train conductor to Santa Claus himself, are Tom Hanks' facial and body movements.  The story itself is ok.  The major problem is that Zemeckis tried really hard to stretch a book that was only about 30 pages long into an hour and forty minute long movie, and some scenes are really stretched out to fill in time.    My overall opinion is that this was a good movie, but nothing particularly special.  The only thing special are the effects.  But this is still a good holiday movie for the family and I would reccommend that you take your family or loved one to see this movie.  Maybe the Christmas spirit in you will be rejuvenated, but probably not.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Say what you want she is the biggest star around and this CD puts together all her hits. the bonus Cd with remixes is great I especially liked Outrageous.  Certain entertainers have that special something that when they walk on a stage you know something special is going to happen.  Britney has that something.  She may not be the greatest singer, but she is the greatest entertainer around/
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I've never been a fan of Hugh Grant's.  With the exception of perhaps \\"Notting Hill\\", he has always come off to me as being somewhat smug and self-satisfied.  In this film he portrays a thirtyish slacker who lives off an inheritance who is confronted with the reality of growing up.  This guise comes in the form of a maladjusted adolescent(Nicholas Houlte) who has to deal with bullies and his mother's suicidal tendencies.  Grant's character serves as a mentor for the lad and in the process matures himself.  The title of the film has something of a double-meaning.  Does it refer to the young boy or Grant's character?  The acting in this film is excellent with Houlte giving a natural performance and Toni Collette as his mother gives a complex reading of a character that could have been cliched.  The script here is excellent.  There are a number of scenes that stand-out.  One involves Grant volunteering for Amnesty International so he can meet girls on the phone bank.  Another involves Grant joining a single parent's group for the same exact purpose.
B000065V1V|4.0|Heathen is a very complex album, even the art in the Cd booklet is full of symbolisim. For example, wherever there is a picture of Bowie using his hands in some way (writing, etc) he uses his left hand, rather than his right. The words to the song 'Heathen' are displayed in the shape of a downward spiral.  <br />People mustn't go out  and buy this album if they think all Bowie is capable of is classic songs from the stone age such as 'Space Oddity' , 'changes', 'sorrow' and 'alladin sane'. If thats all you want and expect from him, then you'll be sorely dissapointed. Bowie has progressed and changed over the years, as everyone does, and can hardly be expected to keep on churning out the same old style of music.  <br />Heathen is very different from most music, full of atmosphere and changing moods. Most of the lyrics make inoffencive and mild, yet at the same time blasphemous refferences towards the church and people's view of god. Songs such as 'I would be your slave' and 'Better future', could at first be interpreted as songs about trouble in love and relationships, but if looked at differently, it becomes apparant that they are in fact lyrics about god and the ways of the church. The words of the chorus 'I demand a better future, or I might just stop needing you..' sugest as much. But they can be enjoyed as one or the other. Much of the music contains strings, angel choir-like voices and often break out two thrids of the way in to the song into demanding drums   that stengthen the whole lot. Bowie's music seems fraught with many, many layers, both in the lyrics and the music itself. Just as you think the song has done as much as it's going to do,setteling into a comfortable beat, another layer is added and  improves the whole picture. <br />All in all, some of the songs seem melancholic and emotional, others are preppy and upbeat (often with a twist), and others are more like rock and roll, especially energetic numbers such as 'Cactus'. An enjoyable album, and not too heavy or in-your-face. Buy it with an open mind.
B00005JL78|5.0|Roger Ebert called this the best film of 2002 and I am hard-pressed to disagree.  Steven Spielberg after the apparent failure of \\"A.I.\\"(not in my book) delved right back into the sci-fi genre.  Freed from having to make a film that had to live up to the expectations of the late Stanley Kubrick, Spielberg made a film that contained his own personal vision but in some ways is informed by the lessons he learned from Kubrick.  There is a certain cynicism about the future that Spielberg imagines but ultimately there is room for optimism.  The film concerns a future where crime is virtually eliminated through the use of \\"pre-cogs\\", drug-induced seers of the future who foretell crime before it is actually committed.  Tom Cruise plays Anderton, head of the pre-cog unit who is also grappling with the loss of his young son and a separation from his wife.  Things are going swimmingly for Anderton until he is implicated in a future crime and it's his time to run.  The themes in this film resonate such as the morality of using technology to violate one's civil rights for crimes you may or may not commit.  The film is also a slam-bang action film that will entertain even if you don't feel like dealing with heavy themes.  The cinematography, art direction, and special effects are all top-notch.  Cruise is excellent and is equalled by Samantha Morton, who plays one of the pre-cogs, Agatha.  There is a great supporting cast here with Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, and Kathryn Morris.  The story has twists and turns that make sense and result in a satisfying conclusion.  \\"Minority Report\\" definitely ranks as one of Spielberg's crowning achievements.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid is a must-see. It should have defined the Western genre, but was not followed, and now remains in a class all on its own. Paul Newman & Robert Redford give perfect performances playing two-bit outlaws in the old west. The film has wonderful dialogue, and creative humor throughout. It's not Jesse James, and it's not Oceans 11, but a wonderful mix between the two. Best of all, they make the bad guys look like the good guys. A true Western gem!
B00005T30L|4.0|Terrific film about the relationships between individuals who occupy the periphery of the \\"mainstream\\", whatever that may be.  Thora Birch is excellent as Enid, an outsider who embraces her iconoclism but due to circumstances out of her control is forced to confront the choices she has made.  Steve Buscemi was robbed of not only an Oscar nomination but the gold statue itself in his role as Seymour.  Seymour is a collector of vintage records and has no delusions about his lot in life; nerdism was foisted on him through no choice of his own.  Through a chance encounter with Enid, love blossoms between these two characters despite Enid's disdain for emotional attachment, at least she says.  This is a terifically offbeat love story that deserved a larger audience than it got, though maybe Enid wouldn't think so.  On a final note, Scarlett Johansen unconvincingly plays Enid's best friend.  Johansen in my mind is one of the more over-rated and untalented actresses working in films today.
B00005JL78|5.0|I have to agree with Ebert. This is the best film of 2002.  Steven Spielberg took us farther into film noir than ever before, and we are left with one of his best works ever.  Tom Cruise stars in this film as John Anderton, the chief of the police force unit, \\"Precrime\\", who use the psychic premonitions of three teenagers, \\"precogs\\" to stop murders before they happen.  This film is wonderfully shot through Spielberg's imagination of what the D.C. area would look like in 2054, and surpasses Jaws for the most frightening Spielberg moment ever with the scene involving Anderton and the \\"precog\\" Agatha, played superbly by Samantha Morton.  The film's strongest point may not even be how well it dabbles with the elements of a psychological thriller, but how much this film doesn't seem like it's possibilities are too far off. Great flick!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Star Wars movies since 1980 when I collected the ESB trading cards when ESB came out. I have also watched the two prequels on DVD as well. I have longed for the original three movies to come out on DVD. So they finally did. I brought my copy of it from a retail (not amazon.com) store on its first day relase. I last watched ANH, ESB and ROTJ on cable TV back in May 2001. I did notice the additional scenes and re-edits since I last watched them, but they did not reduce the joy of watching them one bit at all! I know some do not like the additional scenes and re-edits, and I can understand that, but remember almost all of the movie run time (about 387 minutes) is still from the originals. So you are still getting (IMHO) the feel and spirit of the movies as they were originally made. And thank George Lucas for at least offering us this box set. Who knows, he may finally relase the 1997 versions or the 1977-1983 versions some day, so be patient!
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Mystic River is probably the most powerful film I saw this year.  It deals with the lives of three friends grown up after one of them is sexually abused as a child.  Thoughts of the incident continually distress the abused child, played by Tim Robbins, while the other two are haunted by the wonderment of why it wasn't them.  Kevin Bacon, and Sean Penn play these two now grown men, Penn in the best male performance of the year.  He plays his character so perfectly; his emotion so powerful.  When he experiences a deep loss within his own family, he begins for the first time to start dealing with what he lost a child as well.  It's an outstanding film directed by Clint Eastwood that gave Penn the Oscar he deserved.

B00005JLKN|5.0|I've wasted enough time arguing in vain with my friends that this picture surpasses Silence of the Lambs.  But, I will say that this prequel of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy scared me, surprised me, and dazzled me more than the other films did.  This film skips the typical build up and jumps into the climax within the first five minutes where we meet FBI agent Will Graham, played by Edward Norton whose relationship with the yet to be imprisoned Lecter, played terrifyingly by Anthony Hopkins makes for some terrific watching.  It's a thriller in every sense of the word.
1401301010|5.0|This well-written work is a fascinating, raucous and wildly entertaining account of a man in the trenches of life. Through his amazing forays and obsessions, we gain insight into an extraordinary life. It is no less extraordinary that this man is still alive, after repeated attempts to immerse himself into the hard drug underbelly of Los Angeles.<br /><br />Just like we experience through the beautiful and accomplished album, By The Way, the reader emerges from the rich experience of reading this book with fresh insights and appreciation for the vagaries of an incredible life; with all its ups and downs. Serious ups and downs!<br /><br />Kiedis, although coming across as arrogant and belligerent in his early days, (which he readily admits to), becomes so ultimately appealing because he seems open to learning important lessons along the way. He is willing to transform, turning a propensity for trouble and self-indulgence into a desire to help others and powerfully affect them through his gifts - his music.<br /><br />I was moved deeply (and entertained by the debauchery!) by this academically talented college drop-out who went full speed ahead into his desire to make music. He has consistently gone to the drawing board time and time again (despite lengthy and pesky drug excursions) to express himself, in collaboration with other crazy musical talents, and deliver masterful productions.<br /><br />Some say that RHCPs have slowed down and become too chilled out. I disagree. They are more mature and now draw from a wider skill set and breadth of experience that informs their music and gives it nuances to be treasured. To be able to hear funk with symphony, or pop with rap, or electronica with ballads, in such deft combinations that sound so delicious - is the hallmark of RHCP. The songs are infectious and lasting. The music is constantly evolving in astounding ways.<br /><br />Kiedis is like the affable battered genius or the philosopher/boxer/Bodhisattva who has devoted himself to an adventurous and dangerous existence - in order to mine spiritual and auditory riches for the rest of us (especially those like me who have chosen safer routes) to enjoy. Rock on you shining diamond.<br /><br />In hopes that this unique and brilliant rock-and-roller keeps that promise to his dog and stays in touch with the inherent powers that have gotten him this far. Your newfound health is a gift to us all.has devoted himself to an adventurous and dangerous existence - in order to mine spiritual and auditory riches for the rest of us (especially those like me who have chosen safer routes) to enjoy.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|This seems to be the hit movie of the year. That is not completely a surprise.  There really wasn't another film that overshadowed it by that much, but I'm not sure if it deserves quite the pinnacle acclaim that it is receiving.  It is a very good film though about the relationship between a B actor, Bill Murray, and a newlywed, Scarlett Johnasson, and the way they spend their sleepless nights in Tokyo.  It is beautifully shot by youngster Sofia Coppola following in her talented father's footsteps.  Murray and Johansson's relationship is exciting, intelligent, and incredibly plutonic.  It's about knowing that there are others like you in the world, and the satisfaction that that knowledge is supposed to bring.  Whether it does or not though, the film does not even try to answer.
B000268QB2|5.0|His song \\"Everybody's Changing\\" made me want to buy their album.  I keep on listening to that track almost all the time, and I think I am already hypnotized by the song.  The song maybe depressing, but I really love it.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I loved this film, loose ends and all.  I think that it is extremely clever, very well done, and exceptionally entertaining.  We're not supposed to understand everything that happens.  I still don't understand how Mr. Roger's trolley gets from his house to the land of make believe through that little tunnel in his living room.  But, I love that it does.  That's what the Matrix trilogy is about.  This film is not as tight as the first, nor as ridiculous as the second.  It's just an awesome film.  New storylines and characters are added in to this last film of the series and it entertains extremely well while introducing a lot of thought-provoking moments as well.  The Matrix films were a pleasure to watch, and I am sad to see them go... unless Neo's still out there somewhere?
B0006284JQ|2.0|I am a fan of Britney Spears, but her recent single \\"My Prerogative\\" turned me off.  Since I am a fan, I really tried to make something that would like the song, but sorry to say, I really don't like the song.  I think Britney made a wrong move in releasing that song \\"My Prerogative.\\"  In addition, she tends to be rebellious, and honestly, I think I am seeing different Britney now - she was lovable before but it's different these days.  Two stars for her, because of the DVD.  It must be one star.
B00005JLR8|5.0|One of the best films of the year comes by way of an Irish immigrant family.  They come to New York City to escape the memories of their youngest son Frankie's death.  Johnny, the father and struggling actor, does his best to support his family, which includes his wife Sarah, (Samantha Morton), and two adorable girls.  We learn throughout the film that Johnny has still not gotten over the death of his son, causing him to have trouble finding success doing just about anything.  His girls, however, see everything in the world as magical, even the \\"crazed\\" African man who lives in the druggie-ridden tenement they are forced to live in.  It is a wonderful film that is sure to bring some water to the eyes as you see the story unfold, and the power of hope acted out.
B000005RG7|1.0|On October 14, 2004 I ordered the CD.  As of November 15, 2004 I still have not received the CD.  I contacted the seller (foxtrotmusic@sbcglobal.net) twice by email.  No one responded to the emails.  I would sure like to think there is a simple explanation.  However, I don't recommend any purchases from foxtrotmusic.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|After seeing Memento for the first time, I left not really understanding what had happend, but knowing that it was one of the best movies I had ever seen, regardless. Memento stars Guy Pearce as \\"Leonard\\" who has lost his memory in an incident that killed his wife. He spends the film hunting down his wife's killer, but with a short-term memory that lasts for mere minutes, he is forced to write down clues on the fly as he gets them, and rely on his notes rather than his memory to solve the case. The memory is also played in chronological reverse, turning a clever story into a brilliant movie. This is directory Christopher Nolan's 2nd movie, and beats out his brilliant first film, \\"Following.\\" A great film to check out if you end up enjoying this one as much as I did.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell plays Buddy the Elf, a human raised in the North Pole who heads to New York to find his father in the year's most joy-filled film.  Ferrell's performance made me laugh more than anything else I saw this year, and I am actually surprised that the film was not nominated at least for something stupid, like a Golden Globe Award.  The way that Buddy experiences New York City with his sucrose addiction, and his love of snowball fights is pure holiday magic.  The film easily jumps into my top holiday favorites of all time, right alongside Merry Christmas Charlie Brown, and the freaky claymation film with Rudolph.  It's a terrific film about seeing the joy in every aspect of life.
0140277447|5.0|I am buying this book to make sure my next generations will never forget such atrocities done to the Chinese people. Forgive is one thing, but make sure the truth is being told is also important. I don't understand why many Japanese people just don't want to admit the war crimes done by their ancestors in the past. Compare to the Germans, some Japanese people just earn me nothing but disrespect. However, I also met Japanese people who are honest about the issue. I have great respect to them. I don't believe all Japanese people are bad, but some of them are just morons. <br /> <br />
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is a wonderful movie that makes you question the difference between your real-life, and the life in which you dream, and if you can really differentiate the two. It is filmed in a very interesting and transitory cartoonish style with a beautiful string soundtrack behind it. The film revolves around one young man as he travels throughout a dream stage, and learns little minute long philosophies along the way from his peers and his strangers. The more he learns, the more he understands where he really is, and the more confused he becomes. It's a wonderful movie to watch in a group, if only for the conversations that will spring from the very unique thoughts the movie brings up. Kierkeggard fans will be pleased too, existential philosophy ranks high in this dream world, as does a quasi-Biblical view of the book of Acts. Fun film!
0140277447|5.0|This book provides the truth that happened duing World War II. Cannot believe japanese goverment still try to deny the atrocities they made to the other Asian contries. japanese goverment even juggle the textbook and deny this massacre to their next generation. In this forum, some japanese even jump out and try to deny the facts. If you want to know who is lying, just do some research if you can. There are many evidences in China can give you the truth.

B0000027RL|4.0|I have not been a PJ fan since their establishment.  In fact, I didn't like them from the few songs I first heard.  I thought \\"Jeremy\\" wasn't anything special, and \\"Release\\" was just a grunge band's attempt to write a ballad.  However, they grew on me... A LOT.  This band grew on me so much that they became my favorite band.  This album is not my favorite album, but it is VERY GOOD.  It is among the most influential albums out of the 90s.  Do yourself a favor and enlighten yourself with the grunge genre's founding fathers.

0679745203|1.0|Wow.  300 pages of nothing.  This book is certainly amazing.  Everyone tells me the style of this book is breathtaking.  Yea, it truly is.  He has absolutely no writing ability whatsoever.  The \\"imagery\\" and \\"description\\" that everyone rants about is pointless, boring, uninteresting, and rambling.  There is zero structure to the novel, and to add insult to injury, this hapless book doesn't even lead you to anything.  There's no plot.  It's just a winding nonsense festival of shallow observations and condescending themes.  If you would happen to like a book about 4 people living in a random villa TALKING for 300 pages, you'd love this book.  For all others, avoid this book like the plague.
B00003CXCT|5.0|At risk of offending the \\"die hard\\" Star Wars fanatics, I really enjoyed watching these films with my family. The stories as well as all the effects were great. The sound is awesome. <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|I think Alfonso Cuarn did a wonderful job!  Of course you can't get everything in that the book involves and I saw an interview saying that some things were left out because they fit better in the next movie as far as scripts go. Anyways, as much as I LOVED Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Michael Gambon's performance was much closer to what I thought of when I read all of the books and I think he did an excellent job for as little screen time as he got in this one.  As for saying it is a horror movie, what are you talking about??  Yes, it was darker and more serious, but the kids in the books GROW UP.  They are older and the movies are growing with them like the books do.  Maybe the first book is good for younger kids, but you have to think about the subject material in the later ones.  The movies are going to be more intense, especially Goblet of Fire since there is a death. <br />
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The two best movies ever, Aliens and Alien 3 SPECIAL EDITION!, the superb Alien, and the very original Alien Resurrection (still, the weakest of the four). I would gladly pay twice the price. The Special Edition of Alien 3 adds all the depth that was missing in the original theatrical release. Why did they leave out the fantastic outdoor scenes in the beginning and most of the religious aspects, which only give you more to think about. Alien 3 special edition is the best movie I have ever seen (and I have seen MANY).

068987474X|4.0|Unfortunately this book doesn't get to the heart of the problem. It encourages women to set the bar higher, insist on better behavior from men, and re-iterates that women are not the problem - men are. Well then, who is addressing the men and asking them to modify their behavior? Yet again the full burden of the chasm between the sexes has been placed squarely on the shoulders of women. Yet again women are being told to buy the self-help book, read it, and then change. I just don't get it - especially when the authors state over and over and over again that women aren't the problem - it's the men who are behaving poorly! This book has a great deal of useful advice. The tragedy is that as this book gains even more popularity, there will be more and more women dumping their loser boyfriends rather than put up with being treated badly. This will result in a sudden bachelorette-army roaming the planet, fighting over a finite number of decent guys  - a number that is not increasing! Please, Behrendt and Tuccillo should write a companion book - this time addressed to the MEN of whom they are so critical. Insisting that women raise their bar higher, while not teaching men how to reach that bar is just a recipe for societal disaster.
B000067J1H|5.0|I can see why someone would not like this movie, finding it overly violent, with an unbelievable plot, too complex of a storyline, unsettling characters and a disturbing worldview . . . but thank goodness I'm not one of them.  From the opening scene to the end this is a film that stands out and says: funny, intelligent, thought provoking and memorable - a fascinating little picture of a journey towards wholeness. lol.
0790731509|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the 1960's is \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" which, I believe, is an opinion I share with many others.  It was a different sort of a movie at a time when Hollywood specialized in different sorts of movies.  It took place in a Southern prison farm and it starred Paul Newman in the title role.  If he hadn't had a few other top-notch performances (\\"The Hustler\\" quickly jumps to mind) this would easily be the pick as his all-time best.  He really is the personification of cool at a time we all thought we knew the real meaning of the term. <br /> <br />The story is a rather simple one; a two-time loser joins a bunch of others on a chain gang.  We soon discover the hierarchy of the group which includes the leader; Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning role).  Luke isn't taken all that seriously until he makes an incredible boast and then proceeds to back it up.  He becomes king of the hill but, when personal tragedy strikes, he escapes the prison.  His noteriety grows in his absence but he is eventually caught and discovers just how hot Hell can be.  There's more to the story but the ending is a bittersweet one that needn't be spoiled for the first-time viewer.  The story I did relate isn't giving much away because this movie's greatness lies in the characters themselves; the story is just a way for us to get to know them better.   <br /> <br />This is a movie that stays with you for a long time.  It's one that most of us who saw it once have seen it a number of other times as well.  It may seem odd at times to find ourselves endeared to a bunch of petty criminals but that is inescapable when watching \\"Cool Hand Luke\\".  The big line in the movie is, \\"What we have here is failure to communicate\\".  However, the movie \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" is anything BUT a failure to communicate.  Don't miss this one!

WOW! <br /> <br />The three compilations have never looked so good. You get over 200 great musical numbers starring the greatest legends of the Metro lot, with colors that burst off the screen and sound that betrays its age. <br /> <br />As if that wasn't enough, WB has included hours and hours of mouth watering extras. SEVENTEEN OUTTAKE MUSICAL NUMBERS!!!!...vintage TV specials, and a new documentary that heralds the unsung heroes of the genre. Arrangers like Conrad Salinger...choreographers like Hermes Pan. This is cinematic nirvana. <br /> <br />JUDY, FRED, GENE and the gang are all on display here, and have made my new home projection system glisten. If you have a widescreen TV, the moment when the ATCHISON TOPEKA number goes wide is astounding. If you don't yet have a widescreen TV, WB has provided a fullscreen version. No matter what set up you have, the disc is ready-made for your best-possible viewing experience! <br /> <br />BRAVO to all involved! A PERFECT CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR ALL AGES!
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I first heard about the production of this movie on the George Norry (not sure how to spell his name) show (fomerly wacky UFO and supernatural freak - Art Bell), so I thought it might be a little strange.  I had also heard that the movie was very political and was a basic slap in the face to my fellow Republicans.  But it was NOT that bad, concerning a political slant, at all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the special effects.  The acting was not bad - I almost always enjoy everything Dennis Quaid does.  The story line could have been a little more believable, but all and all, this is a film that delivers great scenes, good dialogue and some very attractive people on screen.<br /><br />I can't think of a single part of the film that I found myself getting bored - that's a good thing.  I would suggest this movie to people of all ages.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum is awesome on the screen.  She manages to have that girl-next-door look and supermodel look going at the same time.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal (from \\"October Sky\\" and the shockingly terrible \\"Bubble Boy\\") does a great job in this film!  I really think he took the role as far as it could go.  I couldn't picture anyone else plaing this role.<br /><br />I say buy it - I really think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />See ya next review!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Minnelli makes magic as he falls in love with his leading lady while she clangs on the Trolley for the Boy Next Door. This is the stuff that dreams are made of, in a sumptuous DVD with loads of extras that is a must-have for MGM musical fans. <br /> <br />Grab it!
B00006674X|3.0|\\"Change of Habit\\" (1969) will not be remembered as one of Elvis Presley's best efforts, but this socially conscious drama represents an admirable change of pace. In his last fictional film, Elvis gives a believable performance in the improbable role of a ghetto doctor. He actually fares better than Mary Tyler Moore - hopelessly miscast as a nun. Though ludicrous in spots, \\"Change of Habit\\" is easier to sit through than many of Presley's lame musicals. Elvis remains fascinating to watch and the climactic gospel-rock number is a must-see.

0385474547|5.0|Okonkwo, the central character of the name, has been dominated by fear.  He is fearful of being like his father Unoka, who was considered weak but kind-hearted.  When his father died, Okonkwo was forced to work hard and achieve the status of being a chief.  Despite his achievements, he is still confronted by his past.   <br />Okonkwo's anger towards those make him most feared by his tribe and his family; especially his son Nwoye.  Okonkwo suppresses his emotions for he doesn't want to be considered weak.  His anger troubles the village chiefs who let him know that he must honor and respct the female.  But he is also confronted by his own tribe's customs.  The tribes customs center around the woman and Okonkwo looks down on the woman.  He wishes his daughter Enzima were a boy because she respects him for who he is.  Nwoye is fearful because his father doesn't show affection towards him.   <br />As the missionaries arrive in their village, change has occured and Okonkwo fears he will lose his status.  This new religion has attracted the outcasts, tribal chiefs and his son Nwoye.    Nwoye looking for solace, seeks it among the Christians.  Okonkwo banishes him from his life. <br />\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is a classic novel written by a very distinguished author detailing Africa pre-colonial times with understaning to their culture and way of living before the missionaries arrived.  In addition, it also deals with man's struggle to be a human being. <br />
B00005JG6Q|1.0|Heh heh heh...I'm sure you diehard Akira fans are wondering how your precious anime commodity would deserve anything less than a 5 star rating.  Well I have news for you; Akira is one of the biggest overly acclaimed garbage anime out there.  To even compare it to some of today's greats is a total waste.  Face it, Akira had it's chance to shine in the 80's.  It's over man, game over.  Why is it in the related matches with Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust?  I still don't understand that one.  I mean, Akira is not a benchmark in anime history.  It's actually pretty funny.  I mean, when that girl gets hit in the face by those bikers...That to you is the stuff of greatness???  And that one part where he crushes his girlfriend on accident; that is one of the funniest scenes in anime.  This anime deserves no accolades; only a throw away.  Don't add this to your anime collection and feel proud.  You are shaming the rest of your collection.  If you want a great anime from the 80's, get some Voltron or something.
0140277447|5.0|When I was young, my parents and grandparents told me about the atrocities the Japanese committed in Nanking in 1937...As a child I wondered how some people could be so low, even lower than animals...Aren't they human beings with families, mother, wife and daughter included? If so, how could they do all the killing and raping for 6 weeks without any scruples and never feel sorry? I'm 30 years old now and it still troubles me.  <br /> <br />Honestly my hometown is far from Nanking, so I'm wondering how traumatic it is for the local people...Even with no family members killed by Japanese in World War II, I grew up with hatred toward Japan and many Japanese people who keep denying their otrocities. I met some of them in America, and I always have a hard time even having a conversation with them...You know, I kind of feel like the whole nation was, and remains, psychologically abnormal, and I'm not used to dealing with groups like this...I firmly believe I'm not alone in thinking this way.  <br /> <br />So all I can do is to ignore them, and absolutely boycott any Japanese products. I'm very proud to say that I haven't bought anything made in that evil and weird nation... <br /> <br />As a history student I've a lot of respect to Ms. Chang, who has the most courage to bring up this topic! A real role model for the youths!!!
B000000OTU|4.0|They should have named it Aerosmith's Greatest Hits: Post Rehab. It's amazing how many hits they have had since bottoming out. These guys are the John Travolta of rock.
B0002VC924|3.0|This is just another Bush bashing film. Lots of prophaganda(sp?), most of it is just sqeud slightly to give for great entertainment values. I have acutally watched farrenHYPE 9/11, another prophaganda film, IMO, it's all pro-Bush, pro-War, etc. I think that both are just alluring you to be on one side of the fence or the other. Both try to take the work of tring to think yourself. As I heard on the beginning of the Tool cd on the video collection, &quot;Think forself, question authority.&quot; Who knows what really is going on, only the people involved know. Until you get a unbiased opionin about anything, then don't go parading your judgement around. Also, Bush isn't as any worse a President as any other in the past, he just seems to be bad at being miscevious(sp?) about it. There's always a hand in the cookie jar, no matter who is in office. But if you are a Bush basher, then this is the film for you.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I did not like the sub title use.  I feel it takes away from the flow of the film.  The DVD should have had English as a language.  Some of the violence seem contrived and silly.  When Jesus is forced to fall over the edge of a bridge that Peter just happens to be hiding under...yeh, right!  The majority of the abuse seems pretty realistic.  The androgenous devil is spooky as is the demonic images that various people see (ie:Judas). As a Catholic, I found the movie less than the inspirational powerhouse others have reported.  It is still worth watching.
0064471837|5.0|THis book was amazing. A majestic novel that deserves a standing ovation. CLAP CLAP CLAP. The entire trilogy is breath taking.  A real page turner.  I really love fanstasy but sometimes writers get carried away in their own magic worlds. This is NOT ONE OF THOSE BOOKS.  There are rules that apply, that make suspension of disbelief easy. If you like fantasy and Sci Fi this is the book for you.
B00005LW7R|5.0|Despite liking most of Verdi's operas, I had never warmed to this one.  In fact, one of the few concerts in my lifetime that I've walked out on (a slightly embarrassing admission), was a concert \\"Falstaff\\" years ago -- my friend and I looked at each other with a sort of \\"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\\" stare, and we fled.    So revisiting with older and wiser ears, I must say that, although this opera will probably not rise to my \\"top ten\\" list (but who knows?), this recording is one of the finest operatic productions I've ever heard.  The outstanding cast, headed by Bryn Terfel in a role that seems made for him, is excellent in every way, including Thomas Hampson as Ford, Adrianne Pieczonka as Alice, and everyone else.  The Berlin Philharmonic plays the score with both passion and precision, and it's all directed with great brilliance by Claudio Abbado, who seems to be having a personal renaissance in the last few years, after some terrifying health problems.      Conventional wisdom: no, this opera doesn't have \\"big tunes\\" as such.  It's more declamatory, with small jewel-like moments of orchestral color in between the exquisite characterizations offered to the singers.  If you're looking for say, Richard Strauss, then this won't be your cup of tea.  If you want the rhythm and drive of Mozart, this probably won't suffice there, either.  But if you're wanting a great story, with terrific acting that happens to be sung, it would be hard to find a better example.      The DG sound is excellent -- \\"velvety\\" is the word that comes to mind -- and suits the opera, the singers and Abbado's vision beautifully.  Highly recommended, especially for those who may not have responded to this piece in the past.

0140277447|5.0|Yes, I am a Chinese. And yes, I personally dislike Japan (government) and Japanese (I use to think only those politician deny the history, but the &#62; 100 1-star reviews from people of Japan changed my mind).  I could be biased based on my own feeling, so do those reviewers from Japan.  But please remember one thing, HISTORY IS HISTORY. It will not change just because you don't admit it.  So please face it. Not forgetting what happened before is the first step to keep suck kind of darkness from happening again.  I Wish Ms. Chang rest in peace.
1591840562|5.0|I am working on a computer graphics startup which creates photo-realistic images.  Art of the Start is a terrific book, a big help to us in our startup journey.  It is both informative and entertaining, and  is much more accessible and cutting through the crap than other startup books we've read.
068484267X|5.0|What can you say? This book takes you back and you become part of the McCourt's family. I recommend anyone who is selfish to read this book. It paints a picture that is priceless. We go back and see the tragedies that have occurred; yet McCourt's asks for no pity. He writes the truth and the details are vivid words that few writers succeed in writing. I implore everyone to read this book.
0142000663|5.0|In 9th grade, they made us read \\"The Pearl,\\" by Steinbeck and I swore I'd never read another book by him.  I had to read this one for a college history class and came away with a whole new attitude for Steinbeck.  Since then I've read several of his other books and he has turned out to be one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />The story follows the Joad family from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression.  They lost their farm to dust storms and greedy bankers and were forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a living.<br /><br />This book has been banned by school boards for years, and I recently read that the reason for this is that the bankers who serve on the boards don't like the way bankers are portrayed in the book.<br /><br />It's a great book and an accurate look at one of the worst eras in American history.  If you like the book, the movie is also worth watching.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Who could have guessed that Richard Linklater's next movie after the Jack Black vehicle School of Rock would be this little gem, Before Sunset? I love, love, love this movie. A sequel to Linklater's 1995 film Before Sunrise, it reunites the two lovers, Jesse and Celine, in Paris nine years later. The two have much catching up to do and only a little over an hour to do it in.     Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both wonderful and really seem to be playing themselves rather than fictional characters and their chemistry together is great. Indeed the whole film feels like a documentary about the chance meeting of two lovers. One reason that I loved the film is that I really, honestly cared about the characters and I was very interested in where they had been and where they were going. It is a dialog heavy film indeed. In fact, it's almost a dialog only film, just as Before Sunrise was. However, every line of dialog is important and every word that is spoken matters because these words are all that the two characters are granted.    The fascinating thing about the two films Before Sunrise and Before Sunset is that they are a portrait of an entire relationship. Two chance meetings, one over the course of a day and one over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes. That is Jesse and Celine's entire brief relationship. In Before Sunset, when they've gone their separate ways and then find themselves meeting again, they realize that there is no one else they would rather be with, even if they're only allowed to be together for a day at a time.    I hope that Richard Linklater will bring these characters back again. I would love to see a whole series of films starring them. I think this is one of the year's best films and I hope to see it get some Oscar nominations next spring.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I bought this movie as part of a 3 dvd pack with 2 other movies that are big hits.  The price was right and I thought that I could just ebay this one and recoup some of the money to make it even a better deal.  Was I wrong.  This was the best of the 3 and that makes it even a better deal!  You can read all the reviews here and they will tell you what the movie is all about.  Don't listen to any of them because I had no idea what this movie was about until I watched it.  It was so entrancing, I had to go through most of the extras on the dvd when the movie was over and it was just put together so well.  A  great mystery, I have loaned this out several times and recommended it more than that.  Don't rent this, you will want to own it!
0140277447|5.0|I can't believe some of the comments (most by Japanese) here. They claim that this is all CCP's propoganda. It is usless to throw around these terms without facts. How do you know this is CCP's propoganda? Are you a CCP official in charg of such propoganda? <br /> <br />Let's talk about some simple facts: Did Japan invade China during WWII. Did China have a war against Japan because of the invation? Did a lot of innocent Chinese (soldiers and civilians)die because of the war? The answers should all be indisputablly \\"YES\\"! Have Japanese gevernment ever apologized for these crimes. Absolutely NOT! Given all these facts, how could any japanese be so shameless to cliam that they are the \\"victims of the victor's justice\\"! <br /> <br />Nanjing Massacre would never have been controversial, had the shamless Japanese government not tried so hard to hide the truth!

B0000AUHPG|5.0|My favorite movie. Amazingly directed by Sergio Leone, I love the camera angles he does. Great story, great acting, one of the most fulfilling endings I've ever seen with so little dialogue. A masterpiece, Fonda and Bronson are perfect for this movie, and I beliee this is Leone's best film.
B00064MW6A|2.0|Some might think that Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' is full of hilariously campy fun; if it had been so, I would have given more stars for the trushy fun I might have gotten.  But the film turned out nothing like that -- in fact, watching it makes me feel more detached from the heroine, the story, the images, or actions.  They are often very campy, sure, and sometimes very bizzare, and sporadically thrilling.  But not campy, bizarre, or thrilling enough to be a minor cult classic. <br /> <br />One mistake is awfully empty and uninteresting story.  Patience Philips (Berry) is a timid designer working for a cosmetics company run by Lambert Wilson and his wife Sharon Stone.  But only the company's executives know that the new product contains a harmful substance.   <br /> <br />And you know, Patience unwittingly comes to know the secret.  and see, she gets killed before the ancient spirit of sacred cat 'Midnight' takes over her body, and she is resurrected. <br /> <br />And?  Well, see what Patience/Catwoman does.  It takes much time for her to realize her power, so she, 'partially' losing her memories, goes back to the company where she almost got killed the day before!  As if nothing had happened!   <br /> <br />OK, that's one of the silly mistakes in the story, but you get more (which I don't point out).  The rest of the film is about Catwoman who struts wearing high-heals, cracking a whip, dressed in black leather.  When you think the film is finally going to be fun (I mean, campy fun), Oscar-winner Halle Berry suddenly snatches meat of raw fish at sushi bar, and swallows it because, you know, she is a cat.  IS she kidding, or what? <br /> <br />Benjamin Bratt plays a cop who fell for her, and who does not know her identity.  But how many times have we seen before such kind of cliched police officer who should have checked out several things about his love?  Or, how many times has Banjamin Bratt played a cop before for that matter?  And not-so-good acting from Sharon Stone who just hasn't shown that she can act since the day of 'Casino'?                 <br /> <br />I really tried to like this film, but director Pitof, for all his visul skills, does not know what he really wants to do.  Actions?  Comedies?  Or just costumes?  He knew it in his previous work 'Vidocq' made in France.  Now I don't have a single clue to his intention.

B0000VD04M|5.0|I'm an Ed Wood fan, probably because his films are so horrible, so amateurish, so poorly acted, that they rise to an entirely new level of entertainment: Wonderful Bad. That said, it took a director of Tim Burton's calibre and an actor as quirky as Johnny Depp to make ED WOOD the delight it is.  And Martin Landau, as the washed up Bela Lugosi, is amazing. This film works on two levels, as I see it:  for those who have never seen an Ed Wood film, they'll probably buy or rent anything they can get a hold of just to see if the Tim Burton film is for real; for those who have seen the Ed Wood oeuvre, the Burton film will feel like an eerie documentary that captures the essence of Wood, and then some.  In other words, you can't lose!  (On another note, doing the film is black & white was a perfect way to capture the feel of the time, the place, and---using the word in its loosest sense--the filmmaker.)
B000094DUP|2.0|Depth.<br /><br />That is an interesting word. We all know we want it from music and we do not like it when an artist is said to be 'deep' and we find out that the total opposite is true. Normally, if I am looking for depth in music I will listen to the music of Lassus, Palestrina, Miles Davis, J. S. Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, Claudio Monteverdi, Giovanni Gabrieli, Brian Eno, Jon Hassell, H. I. F. von Biber, Mozart, Kraftwerk, Prince, Schoenberg, Weill, Berg, Dufay, David Bowie, John Coltrane, Machaut, Webern or Olivier Messiaen. However, I don't mind a bit of low-brow nonsense from time to time and I am not adverse to hearing something with a Pop flavour.<br /><br />I have heard this and the new Delta Goodrem album (which is clone of the first) in my workplace many times now.<br /><br />All I can say is that I am staggered by the lack of imagination and colour on this album. Predictable? Oh yes! Just too predictable, I'm afraid to say.<br /><br />Do we learn anything from these songs? No.<br /><br />Are the lyrics full of insight? No.<br /><br />Are they musically interesting or original? No.<br /><br />Is Ms Goodrem's voice vastly different or better than any other established Pop star? No.<br /><br />Are the song arrangements clever? No.<br /><br />Does Ms Goodrem do anything extraordinary on this album? No.<br /><br />Can you dance to it? No.<br /><br />I have tried to think of a reason for this album's existence and the only credible answer I can come with is that the whole exercise was merely designed to produce some sort of attractive package to sell to teenagers. There is no purely musical value in this recording.<br /><br />Delta and the faceless men behind her only want your money to bankroll their lifestyles.<br /><br />Delta is a shameless media-\\"lady\\". She's sold herself, her looks and her depth-challenged music in Australia for far too long! Please, America, take her off our hands! You'll love this cute little 'Ossey' with such a pretty face! \\"Oh! She can sing, too? Obviously, she should be in a sitcom.

How about 'King's Lead Hat' or 'No-one Receiving' or 'The True Wheel'? Or maybe a song from Schubert's Winterreise?

0140277447|5.0|We all need remember this: <br /> <br /> <br />War Crimes In China   <br />The Nanking Massacre   <br />Numerous eye-witness accounts of the Nanking Massacre were provided by Chinese  <br />civilian survivors and western nationals living in Nanking at the time. The  <br />accounts described thousands of innocent civilians buried alive, used as  <br />targets for bayonet practice, or shot in large groups and thrown into the  <br />Yangtze River. Rampant rapes (and gang rapes) of women ranging from age seven  <br />to over seventy were reported. The international community estimated that  <br />within the six weeks of the massacre, 20,000 women were raped, many of them  <br />subsequently murdered or mutilated; and over 300,000 people were killed, often  <br />with the most inhumane brutality.  <br />  <br />Dr. Robert Wilson, a surgeon who was born and raised in Nanking and educated  <br />at Princeton and Harvard Medical School, testified that beginning on December  <br />13, \\"the hospital filled up and was kept full to overflowing\\" during the next  <br />six weeks. The patients usually bore bayonet or bullet wounds; many of the  <br />women patients had been sexually molested.  <br />  <br />The international community had filed many protests to the Japanese Embassy.  <br />Bates, an American professor of history at the University of Nanking during  <br />the Japanese occupation, provided evidence that the protests were forwarded to  <br />Tokyo and were discussed in great detail between Japanese officials and the  <br />U.S. ambassador in Tokyo.  <br />  <br />Arnold Brackman, a reporter at the trial and author of the book The Other  <br />Nuremberg, commented: \\"The Rape of Nanking was not the kind of isolated  <br />incident common to all wars. It was deliberate. It was policy. It was known in  <br />Tokyo.\\" Yet it was allowed to continue for over six weeks.

B00005JMX6|4.0|Risky Business knockoff yes. Entertaining? A resounding yes. <br /> <br />This movie is pretty much a Risky Business 2004 but with an even more enjoyable flavor.  <br /> <br />First of all the soundtrack is fantastic. However, most of the key music is NOT included in the official soundtrack! David Gray's This Year's Love is not even on it! Even the depressing but excellent closing credit song Maybe You're Gone isn't included! <br /> <br />Emile Hirsch as Matt does a pretty good job of being that uptight HS kid that wants to experience the carefree lifestyle of his fellow student body. <br /> <br />What really makes this movie is Elisha Cuthbert. Incredible, simply incredible. I'll be the first admit that I bought the movie just from seeing her in the previews. What I did not expect was that she would take her meagerly scripted character and make it glow brighter than the sun. She took every scene she was in and showed she can act. Her subtle facial gestures and delivery of lines in some dramatic scenes like the motel room really showed me something. She is so much more than simple eye-candy although I'm pretty sure that alone will endear her to many fans. I can't wait to see her in a movie where she actually gets to showcase more of her acting talent. She is simply stunning on the big screen. <br /> <br />Timothy Olyphant as Kelly the producer offered that edge in the movie. He was also brilliant in his unpredictable character strip. Kelly was a \\"charming jerk\\". He really stole some scenes. <br /> <br />Emile's sidekicks were also a good cast. They offered funny moments and most kids growing must have had one of those two types of friends at one point in their life.  <br /> <br />The movie was definitely at the far end of escapism with it's mix of comedy, drama, and romance blended together but it works for this movie. I say hit! <br />
B0000033PB|5.0|ELP reunite and deliver their magnum opus. This album features instant classics like \\"Black Moon\\" and the incomparable \\"Paper Blood\\". Greg Lake's bass work on the latter is amongst the best ever recorded, and coupled with his soaring vocals and keyboard wizardry from Keith Emerson it makes for a formidable piece of socially conscious rock. Carl Palmer's contribution to the album is also not to be overlooked; the core of ELP is as powerful as ever. The album is a joy to listen to, but the live performances on the \\"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\\" DVD take the tracks from Black Moon to stratospheric heights. Both this album, and the aforementioned DVD are HIGHLY recommended to ELP fans, as well as the musically ignorant.
B00005JNEI|4.0|No, this movie is not so much about 9/11 as it is a assessment of George W's performance and the war in Iraq.      So let's get the facts together.  Something that the people who codemn this movie don't do and instead spew out fear/insults out their mouths.      There were/are no WMD's.  None Nope Zilch.  And, no, conventional explosives are not wmds.  It's easier to use fertilizer.    Osama got away.  He's still out there and planning our demise.  Oh, great job against terror.     While Osama is running away from U.S. and Afghani forces loyal to us we divert more troops to a wild goose chase in Iraq which George claimed was a get those WMD's that we have found loads of... Uh wait, umm we freed those people.  They are so grateful that they want to kidnap/behead hostages, and plant bombs for our troops.    Even when George W. put all his fine and rational intelligence into invading Iraq, he ignored Two Top level Military leaders who testified we would need (~500,000) several hundred thousand troops to secure the country AFTER the war.  Look at the top notch job they did, ie looting, infrastructure rebuilding on hold while people we freed suffer, terrorists rushing into the country after the war -we're still losing our men and women to insurgents because of his decision to ignore this advise.  He instead responded to their testimony by basically removing them and going with advice from Don Rumsfeld and his Cabinet henchmen who made Iraq a priority right from the start of the administration even before there was a 9/11.      Ah, those deadly aluminum Pipes which were used to make hmm.. pipes?  - Yet another example of fear spewing forth to pimp on people's fear.  There's your political capital you pimp.    Haliburton, where Cheney was a CEO, got a no bid contract for Iraq?       The ONLY time in the History of the U.S. that we have EVER PRE-EMPTIVELY attacked another country and and look how right George was.      I feel so much safer.  Oh wait, no!  I feel an irrational attack of fear coming on.... Bomb them all!!!!!  You have the political captial you pimp.      PS.

B00007GZR0|5.0|Oh yes, another great 60s comedy with Doris and Rock.  Their chemistry was so amazing that they can make the most ridiculous of scenarios palatable and funny (See Lover Come Back).  This one is a real joy to watch as Rock succumbs to every malady known to man - the cartoon medicine scene is hysterical -- and Doris is there to support him.  Tony Randall lends his famously funny helping hand and Paul Lynde as a funeral director is a hoot! Why don't they make movies like this anymore?
B000002L68|5.0|This is by far the greatest album he ever released. But even after 20 years we still can't hear the unedited version, unless you have those horrible sounding bootlegs. All the songs (except When Doves Cry and Purple Rain) were edited down for the movie. Hearing the songs unedited makes them that more enjoyable and you understand the context of the incredible songwriting. Its a shame Computer Blue was edited from 13 minutes to a mere 4 minutes. Hearing the unedited Computer Blue I realized this is the greatest song he ever did to date. I just hope one day we will all get to hear Purple Rain album UNEDITED
B0002Z1EG2|2.0|This album could have been perfect so easily.  It's better than no compilation but truly misses the mark.  Here's why: 1) It's missing \\"You've Got A Way.\\"  Instead of 2 versions of the same \\"new\\" song one of those should have been dumped in favor of this classic.  2) There is not one song from her first album.  They should have at least included \\"What Made You Say That.\\"  3) \\"You're Still The One\\" is the country mix instead of the pop mix heard on the radio.  That cool little flute solo is not here.  (\\"Up!\\" is also the country mix.)  Since this collection is culled from just 3 albums you may be better off with the original titles.

But, without the bombing, we don't know how much longer would the war last, how many more people would be killed.    We, Chinese people are forgiving.

B000084T18|5.0|I hear all these people talking about underground and \\"out of work\\" rappers.  If they are so talented, why are they not mainstream?  They gotta keep to the hood, the streets, I get it.  Well, that's their fault.  You're a fool if you wouldn't want to make millions of dollars by doing music.  If someone is \\"too\\" hard to take a check for what he's doing, than he's a moron.  Don't blame 50 and Eminem for all your poor little rappers.  They can't be half bad if they're the one's that put them out of work.  Peace!
0140277447|5.0|Just to let you guys know that... <br />Japanese soldiers used Korean, Dutch, Chinese women and many others as \\"The comfort women\\".  They still deny it or don't care.  They also used many of the civilians for medical research purposes.  There is a film showing Japanese medical researcher cutting naked civilian's arms off during cold winter time after pouring water on them to see what will happen to them and much more.... <br /> <br />But even with all that <br />I believe we should forgive each other but NEVER EVER FORGET. <br />As Dali Lama said, my enemy is my greatest teacher.  <br />
B0002WYS6S|4.0|One of the best live performances I've seen. Not to mention the production on this DVD. (Too bad they didn't play \\"The Glass Prisson\\" !!!)<br />All expectations by far exceeded. A must for any Dream Theater fan.
B00007KWHP|3.0|This review pertains only to the \\"extra tracks\\" version of this album.  \\"America\\" has never been a favorite of mine, with the live version being slightly less plodding than the studio version, and it's certainly not representative of the best of Yes.  Sadly, the \\"early rough mix\\" of \\"Roundabout\\" isn't much different than the album version.  There are a few hiccups, and the mix is, indeed, rough, but it's the same track as the album version.  A demo version or something like that would have been better, and there was certainly room to add a few more extras to this album.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Outstanding movie. Well researched. Brought up the Halliburton mess that involves Dick Cheney and his cronies PROFITTING from the war in Iraq while innocent duped American soldiers and citizens of Iraq die. No one I have ever asked can explain the reason for the invasion of Iraq other than mumbling some vague words about \\"terrorism\\". Michael Moore finally puts to rest my question. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!! It's all about greed and profit and thanks to Michael Moore for exposing Bush and his \\"have and have mores\\" aka \\"his base\\" as Bush describes the ultra elite who support him. Bravo Michael Moore.

Even wounded soldiers volunteered to go back and help after their retreat. Alot of lives were immediately lost, but it was amazing how no man was left behind.

B00000F5KH|5.0|As I have noticed with most Brasilian films, the cinematography of this film is unbelievable! Vinicuis de Oliveira, the actor who plays the young boy in this film has more talent than many A list adult stars in America. The movie is about an old angry woman with nothing to live for, who eventually grows a heart when she meets Josue (Vinicuis de Oliveira)and tries to help him locate his father (only living relative) after the death of his mother. I purchased this film on DVD and watch it religiously, whenever I'm in a relaxed mood. IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY... but they are tears of joy. Enjoy!
0140277447|5.0|International Military Tribunal for the Far East  November 12, 1948.     War Crimes In China  The Nanking Massacre  Numerous eye-witness accounts of the Nanking Massacre were provided by Chinese  civilian survivors and western nationals living in Nanking at the time. The  accounts described thousands of innocent civilians buried alive, used as  targets for bayonet practice, or shot in large groups and thrown into the  Yangtze River. Rampant rapes (and gang rapes) of women ranging from age seven  to over seventy were reported. The international community estimated that  within the six weeks of the massacre, 20,000 women were raped, many of them  subsequently murdered or mutilated; and over 300,000 people were killed, often  with the most inhumane brutality.     Dr. Robert Wilson, a surgeon who was born and raised in Nanking and educated  at Princeton and Harvard Medical School, testified that beginning on December  13, \\"the hospital filled up and was kept full to overflowing\\" during the next  six weeks. The patients usually bore bayonet or bullet wounds; many of the  women patients had been sexually molested.     The international community had filed many protests to the Japanese Embassy.  Bates, an American professor of history at the University of Nanking during  the Japanese occupation, provided evidence that the protests were forwarded to  Tokyo and were discussed in great detail between Japanese officials and the  U.S. ambassador in Tokyo.     Arnold Brackman, a reporter at the trial and author of the book The Other  Nuremberg, commented: \\"The Rape of Nanking was not the kind of isolated  incident common to all wars. It was deliberate. It was policy. It was known in  Tokyo.\\" Yet it was allowed to continue for over six weeks. The question at the  trial was whether each of the defendants were responsible for the massacre.        Death Sentence as related to the Rape of Nanking     Hirota, Baron Koki (1878-1948). Ambassador to the Soviet Union, 1928-31;  foreign minister, 1933-36; premier, 1936-37.

0140277447|5.0|Look at what some reviewers said: communist propaganda, PRC propaganda... Shouldn't the value of human life and human rights outweigh that of the ideology? Shouldn't truth be revealed instead of being covered? A tragedy that happened in China is as sad as one that happened in US, or in any other place. Does the ideology matter at all?! It's probably worth mentioning that the author herself wasn't even born in China. She was born in US, grew up in US, and received her education in US. <br /> <br />Please read the following comments which are cited from anna (san diego, CA): \\"The biggest reason why Iris' book does not have any iota of credibility is that she only repeats PRC China government's official claim of Nanjing war victims of 300,000\\". So you use this single number of \\"300,000\\" to conclude that this book has no credibility at all? How objective you are! Why some people just draw their conclusions in such haste without more meaningful evidences and arguments? <br /> <br />I recommend people to read this book. Don't let other people mislead you or judge for you.  <br /> <br />\\"We seek the truth, and will endure the consequences\\".

If you like Travis and/or Coldplay, you will love this album.  It is not as sweet and simple as Travis but not as intense as Coldplay's last record.  It is right in between.  \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" kicks the album off and will instantly get you on board.  The next 3 songs are of the typical Brit pop and then \\"Everybody's Changing\\" hooks you again.  The rest of the album is very pleasant.  There is a little bit of \\"something\\" in each song that makes it memorable.  I know some of these Brit bands get way too much hype (like Oasis and Blur) but this will be sure to please.

You can get this info elsewhere now, since these ideas have spread so far and wide, but not all secondary sources really understand this stuff, so reading the source first hand is great.

It is one of my favourite scores to any recent film to be most honest.   I must also take this chance to advise something that may sound slightly odd.  If you listen to this CD, particularly tracks 2 and 3 I have found,  while watching footage (with the sound off of course) on your television of the disaster of September the 11th, 2001,  it provides for a most moving haunting and for me at least spirtually and emotionally cathartic experience.   Buy it soon !
B0006284JQ|4.0|Many of Britney's fans should be sad right now for the letter she wrote and posted on her web site (if ur not sure go to britney.com). Britney is \\"retiring\\" for years, since she wants to dedicate to her husband and form a family. That's the reason why she released this GREATES HITS album. But i personally think that she shouldn't have release a greatest hits album just yet. I mean, many of the songs in this album (i.e. OUTRAGEOUS, IM NOT A GIRL NOT YET A WOMAN, OVERPROTECTED) werent big hits. And others (SLAVE 4 U, ME AGAINST THE MUSIC, BOYS) didnt even top the charts. The only songs in this album that can be considered in a \\"real\\" greatest hits album are BABY ONE MORE TIME, OOPS I DID IT AGAIN, SOMETIMES, DRIVE ME CRAZY, STRONGER, LUCKY, and TOXIC. She's also missing some of her hits like DONT LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW AND FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BROKEN HEART (both of those songs were much bigger hits than OUTRAGEUS, BOYS, OVERPROTECTED, ME AGAINST MUSIC) But, oh well. I think she should've released a remixes album instead.  <br /> <br />The 1st single MY PREROGATIVE is one of my fav britney songs and i thought it would be a big hit but i dont see it topping the charts. It's a great song with very good lyrics and it is a cover of bobby brown's version. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is the last thing that we're gonna get from britney for a loooong time. I feel that she's gonna get back to music when she's like 27 or 28, but her return will probably be a BOOM! According to the letter that she posted in her website, when she returns \\"everything will be completely different.\\" In fact, i think that's the reason that she released a GREATEST HITS album now; this probably means that this is the end of Britney Spears' first phase, when she returns, she'll come back totally different in her \\"second phase\\" to mark a continuation and probably evolution in her singing career.
0140277447|5.0|It's funny that someone thinks Iris Chang believed what the Chinese communistic party says. But as a matter of fact, Iris was born and raised in the States. Her parents are from Taiwan. Her grandparents are survivors of Nanking and moved to Taiwan before the CCP took over the country.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I am a fan of Britney Spears, but I was displeased with In the Zone.  The only Britney Spears cd that I would recommend people to buy would be ... Baby One More Time.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|This is Shania Twain's first \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD.  Most, if not all, her greatest songs are compiled in this album, with nonstop listening pleasure-from the first song to the very last.  It has a mixure of pop and country music, with the upbeat country version of the song \\"Up!\\" and the catchy pop version of the song \\"That Don't Impress Me Much.\\"  Her three newest songs are also on this CD, featuring both pop and country versions of the fun song \\"Party for Two,\\" the dramatic \\"Don't!,\\" and the tangy \\"I Ain't No Quitter.\\"  That song is very country-sounding, but is tolerable.  Other than that, every song is a hit.  This CD brings out the best in Shania's music from her \\"Woman in Me,\\" \\"Come on Over,\\" and \\"Up!\\" albums, including the songs \\"You Win My Love,\\" \\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\\"  I really enjoy listening to this terrific CD.  This album is a must have for any Shania fan.

B00006879E|3.0|I purchased Songs About Jane thinking that I have found a very great album.  Admittedly, I bought the cd after I heard She Will be Loved on the radio.  After I listened to the songs several times, and I concentrated on the lyrics very carefully, I sold the cd.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This was about as much a documentary as a Doonesbury comic.  If it had been touted as \\"opinion\\" or \\"editorial\\" I would have given it a higher review.
0140277447|5.0|Face the history.  <br />Chinese and international friends around here can't help to hold <br />back the anger and disappointment to what Japan had done to China <br />during the world war II. The book of \\"Rape of Nanking\\" is just  <br />one page of the whole tragety. Japan at least owes China a  <br />formal written apology.
B000002UB6|1.0|this is the worst beatles album. All songs are good, but Phil Spector did NOT need to put so much orchestratian in the album. I still like the beatles, but no (...) this is the worst beatle album. I DON,T HATE THEM, i jsut think that Spector should not have left this album the way it was and leave the orchestra alone.
B00005JMUL|5.0|My five-year-old son and I saw \\"The Polar Express\\" at the theater today, and we were both completely mesmerized by it.  We have read the book many times, and I was pleased to see that the animation very closely resembled the illustrations by Chris Van Allsburg.  The visuals were stunning, and the familiar scenes from the book (the wolves in the forest, for example) were replicated as part of the animation.  The plot was also true to the book, embellished of course, but never in a way that detracted from Chris Van Allsburg's creation.  The \\"Hot Chocolate\\" scene left us sitting in amazement, probably with our mouths ajar.  Later, I actually found myself perched on the edge  of the seat more than once (and I am 52 years old) in eager anticipation of the next event.  Also, certain parts of the movie were quite touching.  I am seldom interested in seeing a movie more than once (the only other time was when \\"Dances With Wolves\\" came out, about 14 years ago), but I knew as we left the theater that this is one we will have to see once more while it is in the theater.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|McNamara continues to lie and should save his soulless tears for Judgment Day. This interview should be watched by everyone, but only to better our understanding of how an evil mind works. Any student in 101 history would be able to catch his disgusting distortions of the facts. He'd like us to believe he is this poor misunderstood manipulated victim of history and politics. This man is no wise loving grandpa, he's a war criminal! I highly recommend this film.
B000148KK2|5.0|My introduction to the music of jazz vocalist and pianist Diana Krall came with her 2002 CD, Live In Paris. Like most contemporary quasi-popular jazz, it covered classics, but the performance had a youthful vigor and virtuosity that blew the dust off the chestnuts.  <br />The Girl In The Other Room contains some covers too, but these are from the likes of Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits, Mose Allison, and Krall's new husband, Elvis Costello. The remaining selections are original collaborations between her and Costello. Some jazz aficionados have turned up their noses. Let them go. From the instant Krall's left hand begins its first stroll until the terminal foghorn-like chord of \\"Departure Bay\\" fades to thin air, The Girl In The Other Room is a masterpiece. A few more records like this one may yet give jazz a future to match its past. <br />When Krall sings, I want a man to rock me / like my backbone was his own, in the Chris Smither classic, \\"Love Me Like A Man\\", she might as well have been speaking of what her piano does to time in these renditions. She makes it moan, snaps its eyes open again, again, and-a gain, only to close them again with new ecstasies.  <br />Her vocal style is an equally delightful blend of playfulness and mastery. Ella Fitzgerald or k.d. lang might be able to explain all she's doing. But the way Krall massages pitch, her swoops, growls, meditations, and the use of hard \\"r\\" sounds is enough to endear her to an ordinary listener like me. <br />The Krall and Costello original songs hold their own admirably amongst the fine company of cover selections. I've never been a big fan of Costello's music, but his lyrical assistance here resulted in passages such as, I ran my hands down silent keys / For secrets like these / And ever since / They turn up on my fingerprints. Writers drool, secretly or otherwise, over lines like these. <br />To cap it off, the sound recording is first rate. <br />This isn't classical jazz or goodtime party music. But, give it half a chance, and The Girl In The Other Room may sweep you into the future too. <br />
0767830555|5.0|I have seen this movie twice. I don't care if you are offended by the violent ending, don't like jazz or are disappointed that he doesn't kill as many people as Bruce Willis in \\"Die Hard\\", anyone with at least half a brain should see that this is a great classic. <br /> <br />Masterful acting, directing, cinematography and manuscript. And that anyone can see. <br /> <br />Having said that it is also a fantastic movie for the thinking person. I love the soundtrack and the entire mood of the movie. It is very moody. I also love the story, although I imagine some of my girlfriends would find it a little gory at the end. See it if you are a thinking person, definately worth it.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang, Who Chronicled Rape of Nanking, Dies at 36   By MARGALIT FOX     ...  \\"Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their [...], nail them alive to walls,\\" Ms. Chang wrote. \\"Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.\\"
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Though the album is slim, barely considered an LP by most music buyers' standards, its energetic music proves to be worry enough for Amazon.com's asking price. <br /> <br />Since there are many reviews, both negative and positive, about this album, I will try to describe the mood of each song and give you a sample of the lyrics I thought were great and representative of each song. <br /> <br />With each song, as other reviewers have written, there is a bit of repetition to the lyrics, but this only adds to the quality of the music in my opinion. The choruses repeated over and over only add emphasis to the message and build up the listener's excitement to hear the next stanza. Just my opinion though. <br /> <br />(If you're having trouble finding the Russian version, go to their official Russian website and you can download it for free.) <br /> <br />1) \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" 10/10 - Heaviest song on the album, very loud with chunky beats, keeps a fast pace throughout most of the song. It's mood is energetic and like most t.A.T.u. song's, it speaks of liberation.  \\"Nothing can't stop us! Not now! I love you! They're not gonna get us! They're not gonna get us! <br /> <br />2) \\"ATTSS\\" 10/10 - Most recognizeable song on the album, was their breakout song of January/February of 2003. It starts with a keyboard and leads into the song with drums.  The mood of the song is exciting, but does carry a somber note. The lyrics speak of being oppressed, but not allowing society to bring you down because they do not accept you. In the end, you do not have to accept society. \\"...Being with you/Has opened my eyes/Could I ever believe/Such a perfect suprise?...\\" <br /> <br />3) \\"Show Me Love\\" 8/10 - Starts with a phone call between the two girls in Russian. The transcript of the conversation can be found at various websites. Continues slowly with a song about a lover telling another to be more open with their affections, this is a song I enjoy very much. \\"Tell me how you've never felt, delicate or innocent/Do you still have doubts that us having faith make any sense.\\" <br /> <br />4) \\"30 Minutes\\" 9/10 - Slow song laced with laughter and piano notes throughout, carrying a theme of two lovers with only a short amount of time to make an important decision, whether that be interpreted as sexual or just a parting of the two, it has been debated.  \\"30 minutes the blink of an eye/30 minutes to alter our lives/30 minutes to make up my mind..\\" <br /> <br />5) \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" 9/10 - Only non-dance track supported by guitar and drums, a cover of The Smiths original.  Exciting song about equality. I prefer this version over the original. \\"How can you say/I go about things the wrong way?/I am Human and I need to be loved/Just like everybody else does\\" <br /> <br />6) \\"Clowns\\" (Can You See Me Now?) 8/10 - Very light and fast sounding track speaking of letting people know the real you.\\"All this black and cruel despair/This is an emergency/Don't you hide your eyes from me/Open them and see me now\\" <br /> <br />7) \\"Malchik Gay\\" (Gay Boy) 7/10 - Acoustic song played fast with a theme of a straight girl hopelessly in love with a gay boy. It took me a few listens before I began to enjoy this. \\"Handsome, tender, soft,/why do you look right through me./Thinking: \\"No\\". I can't deny my feelings./Growing strong. I try to keep believing...\\" <br /> <br />8) \\"Stars\\" 10/10 - Slow, sad song, with a mixture of pop and rap, speaking of a relationship ending. Very cool mix of English and Russian languages. (Lena sings the English, Yulia raps the Russian.) \\"How did we ever go this far?/You touch my hand and start the car./And for the first time in my life ... I'm crying./Are we in space, do we belong./Some place were no one calls, it wrong...\\" <br /> <br />The last three songs are great as well...I prefer the extended version of \\"Show Me Love\\" over the regular one...plus the two Russian versions of \\"NGGU\\" and \\"ATTSS\\" sound awesome....
0393312836|4.0|I read A Clockwork Orange to  help with studying while I was taking Russian in college.  (The slang used by characters in the book uses words similar to Russian.)  I was pleasantly surprised by the story.   <br /> <br />The plot follows 15 year old juvenile delinquent Alex.  He enjoys ultra-violence, a popular but illegal sport, raping women and girls, and classical music.  Alex tells his story to us heavily laden with slang.  The first person approach it kind of freaky because Alex is so... normal.  Unlike the violent and sexual explicit movie, the book isn't graphic.  What Alex is doing is more graphic than in the movie (at one point he rapes two nine year olds), but he doesn't describe it graphically.  He just does what he thinks will be fun.  If he sees something he wants he takes it  As he explains stealing a car he likes is like picking fruit from a tree. <br /> <br />Alex ends up arrested.  He is offered early release if he goes through a \\"deconditioning\\" program.  The program will deter him from crime.  It works but it has unexpected side effects.  His whole thought process at this point is disturbing since he still wants to rape and beat, but then he is also revolted by violence.  He wants the deconditioning undone. <br /> <br />This book is more of a pleasant curiosity than a must read.  The movie kind of played up the deconditioning and simplified or focused things depending on how you look at it.  The book has more issues, including a peaceful disturbing ending in which Alex lumps his violent tendencies with childhood.  The book is also good conversations material.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|In todays world of garbage rock \\"music\\" being dominated by either whiners (Good Charlotte, Simple Plan) or screaming and yelling (Lamb Of God, Hatebreed), it is nice to see a band that actaully sings! That's right, instead of crying like a little girl or screaming undecipherable words, these guys sing and play good rock music that is worth buying. The only thing I don't really like about this album are the slow songs. However, the highlights, \\"Cold Hard B***h\\", \\"Get What You Need\\", \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", and \\"Rollover DJ\\" among others are worth the price of admission.
B0006284JQ|4.0|I actually haven't gotten this cd yet but I know most of the songs on their except for the one new one. I'm just writing because I thought it was wrong for someone to come on here and bash Britney. It's so stupid. Now I'm not the biggest Britney fan I really don't have a whole lot of respect for her. But, I'll be the first to admit that the girl can sing. She isn't any Christina Aguilera but she's not bad. And if people think she's the best female singer than they should be aloud to say that.  <br /> <br />I personally like Ashlee Simpson, Mandy Moore, Lindsay Lohan, Kelly Clarkson, and my all time favorite singer Clay Aiken better (he's so cool and plus he's a Born-Again Christian. So cool!). But, I would never tell people who like Britney that they're stupid. This is a free country and people are aloud to like who they want. Just saying.
B000059MEK|5.0|Let's see what genres of music we have on this masterpiece of music... Techno: Check. Electronic: Check. Rock: Check. R & B: Check. Classical: Check. Country: ... okay so not EVERY genre is represented, still, the boys from France create one of the best dance/club CDs that I have ever heard. <br /> <br />\\"Discovery\\" is the follow up to Daft Punks \\"Homework\\" (it's been a while since that one was released too...). \\"Homework was another genius dance/club CD, but where \\"Homework\\" lacks in variety, \\"Discovery\\" lacks in consistancy. Every song sounds unlike the others. \\"One More Time\\" is the popular radio track that has an R & B sound to it, good song to get the dance floor moving. \\"Digital Love\\" is kind of a retro sounding 80's love song, in the same vein as many other love songs from that era. It's an enjoyable piece. \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" is a rock/electronic/techo piece to get those ravers out there to get up and bust a move. I also enjoyed \\"Face to Face\\", \\"Superheros\\", and \\"Voyager\\". <br /> <br />The only songs I would skip over, or listen to in short doses, are \\"Short Circuit\\" (reminds me of a robot going haywire, maybe in vein of the movie with the same name?) and \\"Too Long\\", which gets to be repetitive, and, ironically, too long. Both songs got to be annoying. Other than those two, this CD is awesome, and you need to pick it up if you are going to have a party. Throw it in the rotation and watch the dance floor get crowded.
B00009L1TA|1.0|Im not a huge fan of Travolta but i dont hate him either <br />Other than Pulp Fiction i dont own any other Travolta films and wouldn't buy any either. Get Shorty comes close, his performance is good but the film just falters and eventually isn't that great.  <br />Pulp Fiction supposedly revived his career and since then I haven't seen anything that has brought it up again <br />This film sucks <br />sucks <br />sucks <br />Not a zero star movie, it deserves the one <br />but anyone who owns it not only really enjoys terrible films, but really loves has been actors in their worst roles.  <br />TRAVOLTA- Call Quentin you need him again <br /> <br />P.S Saturday Night Fever and Grease may be classics to some people but i find them: <br />GAY! <br />men in tights dancing is not my idea of a well rounded superbly acted dramatic film that i can enjoy repeatedly <br />those films remind me of films such as Dirty Dancing <br />Gay men and women may love them and they may be considered classics in their own right <br />but they are GAY <br />face it <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|the thing about this album is that its all of her best songs... or at least the ones played on the radio and they're jumbled up. i really like the order of these songs although my favorites on this album are her newer songs 1,16,17. i think 16(i've just begun) would make for a great dance club remix. although if you listen to the lyrics its a tad hypocritical of britney to sing about enjoying being single. but besides that... if you like to listen to britney on the radio you need to buy this cd... besides you can get it mad cheap so why not.
0688170528|5.0|Although this book was pretty deep as far as the subject matter-at the core it is a great story about teenage love, and maybe perhaps obligation, that we sometimes feel to a partner who we've been with for a long time.  And the reasons we stay with them even though we think they really aren't \\"the one.\\"  This book had me guessing pretty much until the end-I couldn't figure out what was going to happen or who did what until the very end.  Although even the end has you guessing.    Picoult portrayed young love, but mostly obsession, beautifully and with mastery.  If you love lifetime movies, you'll probably read this book more than once!
B0006213WG|5.0|This album is incredible.  From start to finish, nothing but great songs.  I do have favorite songs from this cd but like I said the whole album is great.  I would start off with No Reason.  No Reason is a such a great song.  I can listen to this song all day long and not get tired of it.  It's so good that I have to sing along to it.  Then pieces another great song.  I just recently made a sum 41 mix album of all my favorite songs from their cds and I found that I used pretty much this whole cd on my mix it's that good.  So if your a fan of Sum 41 go out and get this album.  Trust me you will not be dissapointed at all.
0140277447|5.0|More than 60 years have passed since US attacked Japan with atomic bombs, and Japanese have claimed them as the victims of the use of nuclear weapons from then on. After I read Ms Chang's book, I begin to believe that at that time Japanese did deserve the bombs, and the justice has been done. <br />In his review T.T.Saga said \\"I don't have thorough academical knowledge about this historical matter,\\" then based on what foundation did he draw the conclusion that \\"this book is only scandalous one?\\" The only explaination I can come up with is that either T.T.Saga drank too much saki or he shares the ideology with those excuted Japanese war criminals after WWII.  <br />
B00000G3Q4|5.0|There's a reason why The Evil Dead is always listed among the greats of the horror genre. Ignore what you know about the sequals and focus on the horrific beauty of this movie. <br />While the rest of the Evil Dead movies tried for over the top gore for comedic effect, the orginal is a strait up scary movie, with non-stop thrills. The plot revolves around five teens who rent a cabin deep in the woods. They find a book called the Necramonicon and a tape recording of a translation of the spells inside. Unfortunetly, playing the tape turns out out to not be the best idea in the world, as evil spirits are drawn into the world of the living and begin possessing the teens. Soon only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left and it's up to him to find a way to stop his undead friends. What follows is a bloody fight between Ash and the \\"Deadites\\". <br />This movie was Sam Raimi's big break. He really shows what a good director can do with a small budget and a cheap camera. The movie has a documentary-like feel to it that many horror movies try, yet fail to really achieve. Bruce Campbell is great as a guy who is thrust into a situation with no idea what to do. He doesn't make a move against the zombies until closer to the end of the film. The other actors give good performances in some memorable scenes, like the infamous forest sequence, and Ash's confrontation with his undead girlfriend. <br />Lots of other movies have come out to try to imitate what Raimi did and none have surpassed this movie. It's not fair to compare the original to Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness since they are more comedic then horror. As far as horror movies go The Evil Dead stands on top as king of the mountain. <br />Hail to the king, baby.
068987474X|5.0|The basic premise of this book is that if you need to keep on making excuses about a man's ambivalence ... well, it's a waste of your precious youth and all it entails (what Behrendt cutely refers to as \\"your pretty\\").<br /><br />It seems obvious, until it happens to you. The message is as patently simple as \\"if you want to lose weight, consume less calories and exercise more\\". So why bother to read this book if its message can be summed in a sentence? It's because we (smart women ;)) keep on thinking that OUR case is different and Behrendt shows us in his tough love approach that no, we are deluding ourselves. To drive his points home he explicitly gives us examples of instances when we are apt to cook up a \\"yes, but...\\" excuse and jolts us to back to reality.<br /><br />Thinking back on all the times I made excuses for my exes, I wish someone pointed out the obvious to me. Sometimes (especially when our judgement is clouded by insecurity) we DO need someone to point out the obvious and Behrendt does so in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />The role of Liz Tuccillo is not v. clear to me in this book but her commentary sound very familiar to most women.<br /><br />***************************************************************<br />Allow me to add a comment from my own experiences (hope Behrendt and Tuccillo are listening ;))<br /><br />If a guy goes on and on about how \\"nice\\" you are ... uhmmm ... that's a sign that he sees you as a therapist, not as a dreamgirl. He'll proceed to use you as a sounding board to discuss all the women he treated like princesses and who eventually broke his heart. If he's really all that into you, he should be treating YOU like a princess, not like a therapist.
B00006LLNU|4.0|Every time I listen to this CD, I like it more and more.  It is so rich with soundscapes, anthemic buildup, and a minimalist, stark beauty, that it's hard to resist letting it just draw you in.  If Pink Floyd had grown up in Iceland, they might have sounded like this.  The lead singer veers in vocal style from David Gilmour of Pink Floyd to Thom Yorke of Radiohead.  At times languid, at times majestic, and always fascinating, \\"( )\\" is an amazing work.  All the tracks on the CD are untitled, and the CD booklet has no liner notes, only artwork, adding to the mystery of the band, perhaps a little pretentiously.  But that's a minor point in the context of the music.  My favorite track is #3, with its beautiful piano line and all that builds up around it.  Track #4 is perhaps the best vocal track, and the closest to a hummable tune on the whole CD.  Track #6 with its ringing crescendo guitar line is also a highlight.  But the whole album is full of transcendent moments, evoking in my mind the bleak beauty of their homeland.  This is definitely one of the most unique rock releases of the last several years, and worth your attention.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Frankly surprised by all the negative comments.  <br /> <br />Especially the calling of anyone disagreeing with Americans anti-americanism. jeez, get over yourselves.  <br /> <br />i thought the cast was great. of course some stories resonated with me more, but I enjoyed them all. Was it corny at times? Yes, but love is quite corny at times and much more complex of course, but I didn't expect a Andre Techne-style examination of it in this comedy.  <br /> <br />There was complexity, though in the Alan Rickman/Emma Thompson story and in Laura Linney's dealings with her brother and in Liam Neeson's, much more than I care to explain here and much more than I think the film is getting credit for here. I pumped it up a star for the detractors.  <br /> <br />A great holiday movie, warm stories...simply lovely, actually.
B0002Z1EG2|2.0|Shania is beautiful and she's had a few hits produced by her famous producer/manager husband.  This is a splendid collection of those country flavored pop anthems.  Her voice is decent, but not exceptional, and she's extremely attractive too.  The music enhances her physical attributes when she dances, and she always looks good in front of a camera, as opposed to behind it.
B00005JMXX|4.0|People have been saying they didnt like the plot........Its a movie, its not ment to happen! do you think lord of the rings is going to happen???? or dawn of the dead??? well, anyways i liked the movie, some of the acting were horrible, and there was a cauple of \\"cheesy\\" parts in it. but i dont get why people dont like the plot.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang took a great effort to document the forgotten genocide done by Japanese invaders in 1937. Probably because of the two A-bombs American troops had dropped to Japanese island, there is a prevailing sympathy to Japan in the US. However, people should be reminded that without the bombs, more Chinese, Korean, Americans and including Japanese might die because of long lasting war.     It is true that Iris Chang's book may not be as rigorous and thorough as academic history books should be. However, putting aside the emotion embeded in the book, facts are there. The Japanese troops were conducting genocide.    Let's all remember the Nanking massacre and cherish the peace we have now.
B00001X590|5.0|This is Joe's first album and it is his best IMHO. His following release, Joe Cocker, is also highly praised but I think falls a distant second to this one. Alot of soul and great musicians to back him up, including Jimmy Page. This one is great.
B00005U11Z|1.0|I wish I could give it NO stars. <br /> <br />They've become a joke, a tribute band - a second rate one at that! <br /> <br />What were they thinking - you don't dump the guy who brought you to the big time and replace him with a wanna-be. <br /> <br />Awful, absolute abysmal!  Jon Cain and Neal Schon should be ashamed of themselves.
068987474X|2.0|The book is a mildly amusing elaboration of the author's claim that if a man hasn't called, groped you, asked you for a date, or considered marrying you, \\"he's just not that into you.\\" My problem is that they cherry picked anecdotes to support their arguments.  In some of these cases, the women set themselves up for failure. No wonder the guy didn't call--when Woman X sleeps with Man Y on the first date, she is probably signaling a lack of self respect. The authors gloss over these problems to conclude that all women are great and men who don't call are cads, no exceptions, no excuses, move on! More funny and more accurate than this book is the Sex and the City episode where they began with the storyline that Miranda's guy \\"just wasn't into her,\\" had her embrace this concept as empowering, and then confront a second guy with it--when guy 2 had a legitimate excuse for ending the date early that had nothing to do with a lack of interest (he was sick). As a result of her enthusiasm for this catchphrase, Miranda ended up sabotaging this second relationship before it even started. Sure, he may not be into you, but something else may also be going on. Life is just too complicated to sum up in what is fast becoming a cliche.
B00028HBKM|5.0|just saw the Passion, and first let me say that I have never bothered to review a movie on a forum like this before. Having said that, this movie was extrordinary. It was graphic, at times brutal, but remember the point of this movie, the crucifiction of Christ...enough said. As for the much overplayed charge of anti-semitism, only those who go to the movie looking for such, will see it in the film, and those same individuals will have missed the entire message of the movie. The Jews didn't kill Jesus, we ALL did, because of our sins. If you chose to miss this movie not only will you have missed a great flick, but a potentially a life altering message.
B000667GFK|5.0|I have listened to this album everyday since the day I bought it. If you are considering to buy it, I asure you you will not regret. <br />In my opinion this is one of his best albums and I am sure it will become a classic. <br />His voice sounds great and he sings every song with a wonderful feeling. <br />The Mariachi Vargas de Tecatitlan did an excelent work, the guitarrs, the trumpets sound give the songs a very fine touch. <br />I asure you again, you will not regret!!! <br />Es uno de los mejores CD's que le he escuchado a LM! <br />Excelente trabajo!
B000001C6M|5.0|This is the best slayer album in my opinion. Better then \\"Reign in Blood\\" since SNM presented a raw guitar tone consisting of heavy & fast musical riffs with out the over the top distortion that   Reign in blood and all the proceeding Slayer albums had. SNM best represented the essence of SLayer which is to convey the Evil we deal with in this world.   With songs like Black Magic, Crionics, Fight Till Death, Slayer managed to create a mood that is a cross between  a horror movie and a war cry.   A trully great album with outstanding music. Not meaningless noise like we hear from the Fake metal bands that are out today.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I drove to the video store last night in my Prius and used my Sierra Club Visa card to rent this movie.  I have to say that this was one of the most informative movies I've ever seen.  From Dennis' character risking his life to rescue three or four ice samples to Dennis' character snowshoeing 40 miles overnight, this movie was AMAZING.  From the amazing insulation qualities of the library's windows to the uber-smart students burning books instead of chairs, wowzer!  It teaches us what the neoconservatives don't want to hear--the world really will end the day after tomorrow.  They are a little elastic with the \\"tomorrow\\" reference.  Cyclical climatic changes, shliclical shlimactic changes.  This will happen unless go back on our knees to sign Kyoto.   <br /> <br />Cheney hates the environment with his Haliburton and his oil buddies.  They want to see the destruction of the Earth so they can charge blood money to live on the Haliburton Space Station.  Don't you people see what's happening to us??  Listen to Gore--he was perfectly sane when he used this movie as an anti-Bush platform. <br /> <br />Yay for special effects!  In this day and age, it is completely acceptable to award a movie 5 stars for its special effects alone.  We are not living in a computer age, and therefore, poor acting and dialogue can be balanced by great special effects.  Whoooeeee!  Lurleen, did you see that whole dern bildin' just up and disappuhr?  That is amazin'!  How you thunk they did dat?  <br /> <br />The only think that bothers me about the movie is the ending.  With all of the snow covering the northern half of the U.S., I will have to sell the Prius and replace it with a new H2.  A vicious cycle, indeed.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|The Concert for George is absolutly fantastic. It made me cry and laugh. If you are a Beatles fan this is a sure winner. It just goes to prove that George was very under-rated. His work is great. What a masterpiece. Thanks to all connected to this concert which brings joy to all that realize that the Beatles will always be number 1. I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars. I also recommend George Harrisons last CD, Brainwashed. What a talent he was. He will be missed.  Thank you, Penny

0140277447|5.0|[...]      International Military Tribunal for the Far East  November 12, 1948.      War Crimes In China    The Nanking Massacre    Numerous eye-witness accounts of the Nanking Massacre were provided by Chinese   civilian survivors and western nationals living in Nanking at the time. The   accounts described thousands of innocent civilians buried alive, used as   targets for bayonet practice, or shot in large groups and thrown into the   Yangtze River. Rampant rapes (and gang rapes) of women ranging from age seven   to over seventy were reported. The international community estimated that   within the six weeks of the massacre, 20,000 women were raped, many of them   subsequently murdered or mutilated; and over 300,000 people were killed, often   with the most inhumane brutality.      Dr. Robert Wilson, a surgeon who was born and raised in Nanking and educated   at Princeton and Harvard Medical School, testified that beginning on December   13, \\"the hospital filled up and was kept full to overflowing\\" during the next   six weeks. The patients usually bore bayonet or bullet wounds; many of the   women patients had been sexually molested.      The international community had filed many protests to the Japanese Embassy.   Bates, an American professor of history at the University of Nanking during   the Japanese occupation, provided evidence that the protests were forwarded to   Tokyo and were discussed in great detail between Japanese officials and the   U.S. ambassador in Tokyo.      Arnold Brackman, a reporter at the trial and author of the book The Other   Nuremberg, commented: \\"The Rape of Nanking was not the kind of isolated   incident common to all wars. It was deliberate. It was policy. It was known in   Tokyo.\\" Yet it was allowed to continue for over six weeks. The question at the   trial was whether each of the defendants were responsible for the massacre.         Death Sentence as related to the Rape of Nanking       Hirota, Baron Koki (1878-1948). Ambassadorto the Soviet Union, 1928-31;   foreign minister, 1933-36; premier, 1936-37. Was foreign minister during the   Rape of Nanking and other atrocities perpetrated by the army. As premier, he   led his cabinet in planning the invasions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific   islands, in addition to continuing the undeclared war against China. Convicted   on Counts 1, 27, 55.      Matsui, General Iwane (1878-1948). Personal appointee of the emperor to the   Geneva Disarmament Conference, 1932-37; commander, China Expeditionary Force,   1937-38. Troops under his overall command were responsible for the Rape of   Nanking in 1937 and other atrocities. He retired in 1938 and then ceased to   play an active role in military affairs. Convicted on Count 55. He was one of   14 Class A war criminals who were secretly enshrined as \\"martyrs\\" at the   Yasukuni Shrine, which is dedicated to Japan's war dead and is Japan's most   revered Shinto temple.      Muto, General Akira (1892-1948). Vice chief of staff, China Expeditionary   Force, 1937; director, military Affairs Bureau, 1939-42; army commander in   Sumatra, 1942-43; army chief of staff in the Philippines, 1944-45.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Clint Eastwood's 24th journey as a director delivers a powerful and moving story about the true hurts and aches of loss.  Tim Robbins as a tortured soul, the survivor of a tragic episode in his childhood, is both disturbing and haunting.  Unlike most of the roles Robbins has accepted in his career, he takes this character to the next level, and reestablishing his place in the upper echelon of the current crop of actors.  Sean Penn, plays the other large role, a man who feels that life continues to bring brutal luck and tragedy,  I believe that he is truly one of the more underrated actors of our time.  For those who still think of him as the actor in Bad Boy and At Close Range, you need to see this film, if for any reason, just to see the true maturation of a brilliant actor.  He brings to life a very dynamic and complex character, one who is tought and intimidating one moment, and then the next is a broken-hearted father that gives a shiver to every other father out there.  This film is very deserving of all the accolades it received last year and is one of the few times that a great director and great ensemble cast come together and actually create a great movie.
B00024BHTC|5.0|The first song I heard was Dark Chest of Wonders, I believe. God how I wanted to hear the rest. When I finally heard it, I wasn't disappointed at all. Nightwish has evolved in a great way, the sound is perfect, you can hear each instrument on the album ( the orchestra just adds this..majesty to their original sound). Tarja's voice is as good as ever, maybe better. Easy to see she's worked on it a lot. My highlights : Nemo (at the beginning.. I thought it was just a normal song.. but after listening to it, you can't stop), Planet Hell ( heavy song, you just want to sing it out loud with them ), and Ghost Love Score (my favourite, ten minute long, the chorus is perfect, beautiful, not a single second is wasted in that wonderful piece of work).<br />I know a lot of people dislike the album. But to me, they evolved.. they could have done 5 times Oceanborn, but they were not scared to try other things. I recommend it to all the fans ;)
B0002SROSQ|4.0|The song \\"Hiding All Away\\" is hands down the best song I have ever heard from Mr. Cave, and one of the best songs I have ever heard in general. I have yet to really warm up to the rest of the disc(s), it takes me a while to warm up to new Cave, but \\"Hiding all Away\\" is worth the price of purchase. Get these discs if only for this song, it'll send shivers up your spine.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|All of her songs are wonderful, so each album itself <br />is a greatest hits album. I Ain't No Quitter has a catchy  <br />chorus.

0140277447|5.0|In fact, the people now living in Nanjing are mostly from other regions in China, there are very few native Nanjing'ers left after that horrible incident. (The native Nanjing'er speaks a distinct dialect.)    The Japanese keep the war criminals in their Shinto shrine and Japan's prime ministers pay frequent visits to the shrine, these all clearly state the sick mind-set of the current and past Jap government.
0316168815|5.0|Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones is a rare masterpiece, and one which kept me up far past a reasonable hour on a number of occasions. <br /> <br />Although difficult at times to digest, Sebold's story of a young girls murder and the life and struggle of those left behind, is at times both very real yet magical, and both an unspeakable tragedy yet hopeful joy. It is, however, always engaging and difficult to put away.  <br /> <br />Call me old fashion, but I would have a hard time recommending this one to any non-adult, due to the very difficult nature of the violence, specifically, the murder of a young child.  <br /> <br />If the 2000 +4 star ratings are indicative of anything, it is of the ability of this novel to resonate with so many different readers. No matter who you are you will find something to take away from this book, making it well worth the addition to your own library.  <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|This film stars Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel Mc Adams (The hot chick, Mean girls.) The film is funny, sad and thought provoking all at the smae time. It sends out a brilliant message that anyone can relate to. It is the best love story I have ever seen and it deserves to be remembered as 'a true mother-daughter movie, no matter what the age.' Much better than Titanic and a movie I will be sharing with others.
B000002O7C|5.0|There is no doubt this a short CD; however, there is less doubt that there is more fantastic music in the 30 minutes here than in most other two CD soundtracks.<br /><br />Basil Poledouris really is a genius.  There are few composers who can create a feeling of adventure just with a few bars.  The Russian overtones add the right flavor to make the composition exotic and exciting.<br /><br />Like other reviewers I miss some of the music in the movie that is not in the CD.  I enjoy each music piece so the order doesn't bother me too much.  Ideally of course it would be nice to have the missing music assembled in the correct order.  I suspect that would make the whole experience that much more satisfying.<br /><br />I wonder if I should give this 4 stars, but I love the music that is there too much.  5 stars because it is one of the great soundtracks out there.

0393039765|4.0|Kinda fun to read since I love the film so much.  Several key events were different in the adaptation but the best lines and heaviest ideas are taken straight from the book.  The original narrative is pretty scattered which the film sews up a little tighter.  It still packed a punch even though I read it after seeing the film a bunch of times.
B00005JMUL|5.0|Adapted from a classic children's book written by Chris Van Allsburg to the screen using computerized technology about a train ride to the North Pole, an expensive process but well worth the visual effects.  This was a complete Tom Hanks film using software to match his voice and mannerisms to many varied roles.  I liked him best as the conductor who punched letters into the children's tickets, return punches would complete a word -- each different to match their personalities and needs.    There is a lovely snow scene in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 11 p.m. on Christmas Eve when the mysterious steam engine arrived in the boy's own front yard with effects (shaking and noise) similar to an earthquake.  A skeptic about the validity of Santa Claus, he'd already looked in the World Book encyclopedia to read about the North Pole never thinking he'd travel there in less than an hour.  The boy was a lot like Brett (age 9) as he watched the mechanical Santa in a store window as the train went past.    It is a magic train, all alight in several cars but the children, dressed in sleepware, sat in one car except for Billy.  A sad little boy who'd never received Christmas gifts, he sat by himself in the caboose.    There were tapdancing waiters who served refreshments.  The hot chocolate left a brown mustache (like the while 'milk' one) on each child.  A lost ticket, swirling in the wind, lands amid a wolf pack; with the help of a bald eagle, it magically found its way back inside the train.    That's only the beginning.  Boy discovers the hobo who calls himself the 'king of the train' on top of a coach car and they ski (cross-country style) to the engine where he jumps into the coal car.  He thought he was asleep and dreaming in the swirling snow.    The hobo imprints on his mind that 'seeing is believing.'  But after a harrowing escape from the breaking ice after the train jackknives and slithers to safety, he learns that 'sometimes the most real things in the world are those we cannot see.'    Inside the cab of the locomotive, he blows the whistle, and the train has to stop as deer are all over the tracks.  It seems that the engineer could talk Karibo when his long red hair is pulled.  Both engineers were comical characters as played by Michael Jeter.    The music was magnificent as they take a wild ride down the mountain like a roller coaster.  We witness optical illusions with the Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle.  The tramp turns out to be a puppeteer with a marionette of Scrooge (bah, humbug), both patterned after Tom Hanks.    At the North Pole, we see a lighted Christmas tree even taller than our National tree in Washington, D.C. or that at Rockefeller Center in New York City.  Three children are separated from the group and endure another wild ride on the curvy tracks around this city of lights in the runaway caboose.      There appears to Boy a ghost of the hobo offering a nice hot 'cup of Joe' before they are stranded on a train turntable.  After a perilous walk to the tunnel, they find Santa's workshop in a cul-de-sac (dead end).    The lost children had adventures galore in the inner workings of the labyrinth and see all the 'good of Christmas.'  If you see only one Christmas movie this year, let this be it.  A delight for the whole family, it can't be beat for having Christmas spirit -- plus appropriate music.    Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' is playing as the mountain of gifts is lifted from an open observatory like Kitt Peak in Arizona and floated over the lighted city in a hot air balloon.  The 'flying eleves' (\\"kids, do not try this at home,\\" directed the conductor) sky-dived as the enormous bundle is loaded onto Santa's sleigh.  It takes some bungie-jumping to put the star on the tall tree.    As long trumpets herald the arrival of St. Nick, the prancing reindeer are a sight to behold.  It's as if we were in the Land of Oz with all the munchkins.  Santa's blue eyes were like those I remarked on recentlywhen I talked with a 'Victorian Santa' at the East Tennessee History Center.    Santa explains his gifts: first, you must 'believe'; one child received a 'smidgin of humility'; another, \\"no greater gift than friendship.\\"  He tells everyone that \\"the true spirit of Christmas is in your heart.\\"  His fiber-optic reindeer whip made the tall tree magical.    The Polar Express returns and they leave the city of lights as they head for home amid thick snow flakes and sparkling icycles.  The children are told that \\"it doesn't matter where a train is going; what matters is to decide to get on.\\"  Under the tree on Christmas morning is an old fashioned truck toy (which dates the story) and a harlequin doll like the one I have for Eric, age 4.  Santa had gift-wrapped and delivered his special present, The Christmas Bell.    Our local excursion train, the Rambler, is taking a Polar Express this Christmas on its regular route with readings of this book as special entertainment.  A giant step (I've been on these trips at different times of the Spring, Summer and Fall.), but this time it's 'reservation only.'    Completed in only 56 days as a result of the computer technology (rapid progress), I predict this will become a classic like Burl Ives' 'Frosty the Snowman' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'  An uplifting story.

0767906543|5.0|Comedian Mike Duffy has been with his girlfriend, Mel for 4 years and counting. While Mel is ready to take their relationship to another level, Duffy sees nothing wrong with leaving things as is.<br /><br />This is the first time that I have read a British \\"chick-lit\\" novel not only written by a man but starring a hero instead of a heroine, and I must say Cheers to Mike Gayle!<br /><br />After Mel proposes to Duffy, he says yes. But even still, she knows deep down that he doesn't want to get married. So she gives him an ultimatum - unless he can commit to her as a husband and not just a boyfriend, then there is no chance in them getting back together. Duffy thinks he can handle it - maybe even change Mel's mind and convince her that things are fine the way that they are. Time moves forward, and Mel is the first one to start seeing someone else - this has Duffy sick. He obsesses over this situation and slowly but surely he begins to realize how in love with Mel he is... But is it too late? Has Mel already closed her heart towards him? You'll have to read to find out. I will tell you that I was a bit surprised at the end. Gayle really had me going.<br /><br />This is a definite must read. A cute and hilarious story that also tugs at your heart.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|Get it. It got me. It has everything that's awesome about great rock 'n' roll, hell, everything that's great about music. Did you see Jack Black in \\"Hi Fidelity\\" when he was pushing \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" on a customer? Well, i agree w/ Mr. Black about B on B. And the same thing he said for B on B I say for \\"London Calling- The Legacy Edition\\". Bob's album is not a hippie record but rather a hippie era record- just great music. \\"London Calling\\" is not a punk record but rather a punk era record, timeless really. \\"This one goes to eleven!\\"
B00028HBKM|5.0|A Masterpiece of filmmaking and what movies were meant to do; The Passion tells a story, historically accurate and profound. A story read by many, pondered on by fewer and believed by even fewer still, the Passion does what no other form of media is capable of doing; it draws all the senses together and let's you feel the story of the Gospels. <br /> <br />Like all movies that are based on a true story, it goes out on a limb in a few places to fill in the gaps, where books are free to be ambiguous but movies are not. Yet those places are few and far between and in my opinion actually fit the story quite well. We may never know in this lifetime whether the fill-ins are accurate, but I see no greater harm being done then when believers speculate in private as to \\"this or that\\". <br /> <br />A professional \\"critic\\" Ty Burr, of the Boston Globe, stated that the movie was too much focused on gore and not theology and A.O. Scott, of the New York Times, stated that the film seems to arise less from love than from wrath; to which I have to say I'll never read the reviews of these men again. I make this statement confidently, since I, as an occasional moviegoer was able to find what they somehow missed. It's not as though I am the only one, at the time of this writing eleven reviews with an average of \\"A\\" have been written by the professionals; all but these two are rated high. Therefore I am more inclined to believe that ulterior motives are behind the negative remarks and I find that very unprofessional.  <br /> <br />A closer look at the criticisms reveals the impractical and unwarranted nature of the attacks. To say that the film lacks theology demands a comparative, that is to say, compared to what? Certainly not your average film, I don't know of too many films that are rich in theology. Comparing the film to other Christian movies, such as the famous one by Charlton Heston, is not comparing apples to apples, in the sense that you expect the Mel Gibson film to be morea dramatic experience than a dry narrative. Don't get me wrong the movies of the past are great in their own respect, but the most dramatic they ever attempt to get is voice inflection, when Charlton lowers his voice and says \\"Let my people go\\". It's the difference between the Discovery Channel's special on the Holocaust and Schindler's list - both are valuable and both need to be graded based on their own genre. What is surprising is that the movie maintains such a large degree of historical accuracy, not that it is lacking in any or lacking a theological lecture; something the movie was never intended to be. To the charge of a lack of love, I am awestruck. The love that the man Jesus shows is exactly what Christians have maintained for over two millennia. It is the story of a man, wrongly and falsely condemned who shows compassion for those \\"who do not know what they are doing\\" and who even a sinner dying besides the man Jesus, recognizes as not worthy the punishment but \\"praying for you\\" in the midst of the horrible torture. \\"No greater love has a man, than this...\\" cannot be escaped as you watch the film. Truly a most horrible oversight by a self proclaimed \\"professional\\". <br /> <br />All having been said, I am a better person for having watched this movie. Paul Harvey said it best when he said: \\"You don't watch this movie, you experience it!\\" Perhaps it is due to our multi-media culture, that I have grown up in, or an overall dumbing down of the populace - but I don't seem to be able to create the drama of the film in my mind, when I read a book or listen to a tape. Some people have been blessed with that ability, but not I. For me then, the movie does what no other form of media can, and with the small discrepancies and conjecture on the part of the movie and director aside, I am thankful and proud to recommend Gibson's work.
B0000CCZ3A|5.0|If you have the $ or are in Australia get, this one w/ the extra disc. V good. The extra disc is a great idea too. I'm not a big fan of \\"extra hidden track\\" tracks. If put on a bonus disc then it doesn't screw w/ the original; it becomes an addition and you can take it or leave it. When the e.p. came out one could download it. I was technically not capable of doing so but fortunately my brother-in-law just moved to Australia so he picked me up a copy. Cool. Getting this one instead of the original configuration of YHF is not a must. It's only a must if you happen upon a copy in yr travels. You could then trade in yr original copy or give it to a friend to spread the love.
B000002P2V|5.0|If you are a Who fan and already have their previous cds this one could be a surprise as it is almost as good as any of their best works. There is obviously an '80's' sound starting to creep in but the power chords and the compositional style of The Who is absolutely there. Get it and enjoy one of the last work s of a truly great rock n roll band !
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I can't say that this album was a disspointment, I was expecting it to be crappy teen rock. It seems that all Avril can bring herself to write about is teen \\"love,\\" it gets repitive, whiney, and just comes off as immature. I mean how many guys could possibley have broken her heart?Sadly, I caught myself humming along, the tunes are very catcy, very made for radio. If you liked Let Go, then you will definitly enjoy Under my skin. Its Let Go on a higher budget. Have fun!
B00005JMAH|4.0|The essence of the series lives in this movie.  The director set out of a mission to bring some of the more natural and realistic growing pains of being a teenager into our little Harry Potter universe.  Though, as with all movie adaptions of books some things are left out and some things are added, you've gotta admit it's a pretty good ride.  Michael Gambon is exactly how I imagined Dumbledore.  As a funny seemingly slightly irrevelent figure.  In the books he is always making jokes and winking and pretending not to be aware of things.  I think it was fabulous that Harry, Hermione, and Ron were starting to act like teenage kids.  In the books, Harry becomes very angry over time. Also, the caliber of the acting from the youngest actors have become  tenfolds over the first two movies.  I for one couldn't imagine anybody else playing any of roles.  The movie really steps up and brings the intensity of the emotions and relationships that are formed into the spotlight.  And has been said before, the Knight bus was awesome, Professor Lupin and Professor Trelawney were stunning, the dementors are scary, the hippogriff beautiful and I did like all the 'artsy' license taken with the film.  And as someone who was previously unfamiliar with the Harry Potter universe, after immediately watching the movie I plunged headfirst into reading the books.  I wasn't confused by the movie or found myself not understanding what was happening.  I think there were some slightly jerky transitions, but, I felt deeply immersed in the world onscreen.  All must remember, that the movie versions are being written to follow the series' flow.  And not to stand alone as it's individual book adaptation.  And with two books left in the series, one currently being written and the other with only the very last chapter completed---I think the screenwiter and directors are making brillant choices as to what they illuminate on screen.  I say generally a good time for all. <br /> <br />Now pass the butterbeer, please.
6305128952|5.0|A very fine film, maybe a little bit slow at times due to the desire to capture the very special rhythm of Montana. The story of a New York girl and her horse taken up in the trauma of an accident. The horse has become wild and the girl has lost a leg and finds it difficult to cope, what's more she culpabilizes the accident and the sore fate of the horse. So far nothing special. The mother is a magazine editor and she decides to take the situation in her own hands and to look for help from a rancher in Montana who is known as having very special contact with horses. He is the horse whisperer. In other words he is a horse psychologist. She drops her responsibilities and drives there with the horse and her daughter. It is then the story of the recovery of the horse and of the girl in the hands of that man. Patience, contact, even when necessary some force on the horse and some authority on the girl. The mother and the daughter integrate the ranch and discover a completely different life and rhythm : to live in nature, with animals and raise them. We try to forget that it is only to produce meat. The scenery is grandiose and the absence of any distraction makes the mother and the daughter concentrate on themselves, and regenerate their life energy. Just this adventure is strong anough to be fascinating. It also reveals that these ranchers, who are extremely satisfied in this life, have a past experience of the city (Chicago for instance), of cultural entertainments (classical music for instance) and are not completely cut off from life due to television. But this life also provides children with early activities and responsibilities and makes them grow a lot faster, not so much in their bodies but in their minds and psyches. They are able to cope with life at the age of twelve. This is an amazing education that has to be contrasted with the childish and infantilizing education we provide most kids in our schools. Of course a love, not affair, but adventure develops between the mother and the horse whisperer : change, a completely new universe, the discovery of feelings that are of a new nature. The attitudes of these two and the father that rejoins them at the end are surprising in many ways : the freedom granted by the father to his wife, the responsibility of the mother who will in the end return to New York, and the deepfelt passion of the mother and the horse whisperer that will be dominated and kept human and humane, a passion of the soul which will make it a lot more difficult to break, and yet which will remain totally controled by the mind. No abandon, no reckless delving into it, just accepting it and keeping it within the limits of a humane vision which takes into accounts the interest of others and not only the selfish desires of the lovers. Love becomes then a mental and cultural blending of feelings and experiences. It can be brought to an end but it will always live and survive. The film is extremely moral in a way and tries to show that natural living conditions do not produce uncensored impulses, far from it. To go back to nature builds a deeper moral and ethical approach to life. Some will say that is a myth. Right they are. Some will say that is a dream. Right they are. Some will say that is an illusion. Right they are. But it is something that does exist and that shows human beings are definitely not animals.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUween the mother and the horse whisperer : change, a completely new universe, the discovery of feelings that are of a new nature.

What's worse is that they never admit they did this. japs still do not apologize to other victim countries now!! Just look at how those japs wrote those reviews!!! You will know how their education teaches them to erase all the tragedy history!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|George Lucas was once brillent. Now, it seems that all he cares about is money. He has over-edited and changed his classic trilogy so much that its integrity has been damaged. Fixing a blooper here and there is fine, but completly changing scenes and actors 30 years after the fact is just cruel. I love Star Wars and grew up on it, but let's have the original released on dvd and not this hack job.
0140277447|5.0|The author has passed away but the bood she wrote is the best I ever read in my life. When Japanese want to obliterate the history of this period, the book carries out a supportive materials to show this unforgottable Holocaust, which definitely was made by Japanese fascist. The fact cannot be written out. So, it is an excellent work for us. We, all of human being, should remember this history and Japanese should self-question yourself and your behavior.
B00008ADPF|1.0|Nickleback is Clear Channel's best friend: their music is ordinary, dull, and absolutely defining mainstream. The songs here are all the same, with poor lyrics, and Chad's standard, ordinary singing style. Sorry about using ordinary so many times, it just defines this band so well.  <br />I find it hilarious that \\"A kid's review\\" was chosen as a spotlight review, because he/she defines the average radio-listening, Nickleback fan. What I hate about bands like this is that they take away radio time to expose bands that deserve our attention.  <br />Anybody with brains should turn this off and listen to real talent like In Flames. If you must listen to a radio-dominated band, at least listen to A Perfect Circle, Tool, Nine inch nails, Muse, Metallica (pre-St. Anger), or anything elsewith substance. By the way, try looping \\"Someday\\" alongside \\"How You Remind Me,\\" you'll see how Nickleback has produced two almost identical songs, caused by their radio-friendly formulaic song writing skills.

B000002KOY|5.0|I've always been a big Neil Young fan but it wasn't until a few years ago that I started purchasing Crazy Horse cds. This turned out to be my first and favorite Crazy Horse purchase. It's just a tight rock and roll album with some very good songwriting and playing. \\"Look At All The Things\\" is a hauntingly beautiful piece of work and is my favorite song on the cd. Other highlights include \\"Downtown\\", \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" and \\"Beggar's Day (covered by Nazereth on Hair of the Dog!). Danny Whitten would succumb to a drug/alcohol overdose after the conclusion of this album and was part of the inspiration for Neil Young's \\"Tonight's the Night\\" effort. Whitten was a multi- talented musician and song writer and as the case of many young musicians fell by the wayside and halted his life at a young age due to drug and alcohol abuse. We will never know how far Whitten could have gone in his musical career. Crazy Horse were able to step out of Neil Young's shadow on this cd and create heartfelt and meaningful music on their own. A good investment.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Honestly folks, if you liked Devil's Night, if you like D12 for whatever reason you have (personally, they just crack me up.) You'll enjoy D12 World.  There are tracks that'll make you laugh, and there are tracks that are almost enough to make ya cry.  Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
B0000027RL|2.0|i cant believe the hype i've heard about Pearl Jam....i mean dont get me wrong here, they make good music but doesnt it seem a little strange that they sound just like Creed and even Silverchair back in the day. now thoses bands have talent and originality. so if your thinking of buying Ten or any other Pearl Jam album, i would suggest Creed's Human Clay instead. God Bless.

Please release the Richard Donner version as the story would be more complete!!!!!!!
B0000508U6|5.0|This is a great indigenous effort by Coldplay.Very often when people talk about bands they forget the other band members and focus attention on the vocalist but I must add at this point that the whole band seems to be in a great groove. Its one of the best first albums you'll ever hear. Its nowhere near being the best Debut though.<br /><br />I heard \\"Yellow\\" a long time back and dismissed it off as a silly POP song. Never gave it a chance to grow on me. Then sometime in 2003 I heard the song again and I was just broken. Its like a love anthem you'd sing for the one you truly love. There's no one person who the song really belongs to because it<br />holds a great spark of emotion in its intriguing sound. Yellow brings a smile on my face each time I listen to it. I downloaded the video then and I saw what I could hardly believe. \\"Look how they shine for you...\\" I can safely say that way into time I'll look back at my life and this is one song that will remind me of those cold winter nights and the silly happy for no reason summer days. God Bless Yellow.<br /><br />\\"Dont Panic\\" Used to amaze me until I heard it 100 times.Its an average opener.<br />\\"Shiver\\" has this rapid emotion building melody to it which is smooth but a little incomplete.Good song though, one that will remain in your mind.A definite strong point of the album are the groovy hooks and chain of \\"Im better than the last one\\" Kinda tracks.\\"Spies\\" is a song you'll often find playing in my<br />room. It seems to make my incompletely complete room look complete.\\"Sparks\\" is something I wont do the foolishness of describing in mere words.<br /><br />\\"Trouble\\" is my favourite song on the album and its just the perfect song to hear....nevermind its just beautifully depressing yet uplifting.<br /><br />\\"Parachutes\\" never ceases to amaze me with its 46 seconds of control and absoluteness in terms of words and melody.\\"Here I am and I take my time , Here I am and I wait in line always...always\\" A Tearjerker! A Marvel!<br /><br />\\"High Speed\\" is super fantastic. \\"We Never Change\\" is something that makes the album look (or sound) Like a wall of emotions , all complete in themself. These are all winners mind you. Coldplay are here to stay.<br /><br />\\"We Never Change\\" is a song that lazily highlights the feeling of waking up late on a morning you were supposed to be awake earlier.\\"Everythings Not Lost\\" is just unbelievable but wears out on you soon if your impatient.(Im not) \\"Careful where you stand\\" is a moody groover.<br /><br />This album is close to being perfect. Beware of the song \\"Trouble\\" because it can make or break you.We Never Change\\" is something that makes the album look (or sound) Like a wall of emotions , all complete in themself.

B000003TA4|1.0|I bet Nirvana could have acheived higher musicality if they were playing with pots and pans and car horns as opposed to musical instruments.  <br /> <br />Everybody thinks it was Korn, but it was really Nirvana who were the true founders of this \\"nu metal\\" teen angst garbage.  You can blame Nirvana for all those annoying \\"mallcore\\" bands like Korn, Nickelback, and Linkin Park who have dominated the rock charts since the 1990s.  Almost everything bad about today's music started with Nirvana==monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiny lyrics about how miserable life is.   <br /> <br />Do you Nirvana fans really believe all the hype about Nirvana \\"killing off hair metal\\" and \\"saving rock and roll\\"?  Nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things.  Nirvana weren't about music.  They were about conformity, and nothing more.  Just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable, immature fools from their money.  They were the Linkin Park of 1994.  I blame Nirvana for everything bad that's happened to music in the last decade.
0140277447|5.0|It is sad to see in many reviews people use ideology to disguise facts. Here are some facts to consider:  a. The massacre was conducted by [...] Japen to China in 1937, before the Communists took power in 1949.    b. It's the communist China who gave up the right of indemnity in change of diplomatic acknowledgement of Japen.    Hide fascism behind communism is really a shame.  German's crime to Jews is all known to the world, espeicially inside U.S., where countless articles and Hollywood movies have demonstrated it. Whereas  Japen's crime in Asia during WWII is known little to the public. This is the first book published in U.S talking about the that history.    What's more important, is that fascism in German is not mainstream anymore, but fascist in Japen is still believed and carried out by considerable number of people,organizations and politicians. While Iris was writing the book, she received many death threats, but she still finished her book. That job sure isn't some coward working for money can do. Salute to the hero who revealed the facts.
0345457684|1.0|Reminds me of the kind of stuff I saw in my junior college creative writing workshops. Really. Sorry to be rough on the guy and God bless him for putting it out there, but I was so bothered by the stilted writing that I had to put it down. Completely unsubtle, boring use of the language. Like a white boy playing the blues: the guy has a couple chops but lacks soul. Who cares?<br /><br />Read William Gibson again (or for the first time GO NOW!) for chrissakes. How many pages did I get through? About 20 I guess, maybe a couple more. Admittedly, it's not completely fair of me to review a book I hardly started, but I'm suggesting that you not make the same mistake I did and spend money on this. Further, I'd rather re-read Neuromancer a thousand times than take another crack at this brick so this is what you get.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is the FIRST movie that my whole family enjoyed together. I have 3 young children who tend to get \\"spooked\\" at the movies. Usually there is conflict that is too intense for their sensitive little brains to handle. The conflict in Elf is not too intense. Elf was a JOY to see! This movie is funny, delightful, happy and NOT sickeningly sweet! Your whole family will enjoy it. I am looking forward to owning it on DVD!
B000002BFL|5.0|Why?  Because, after the scattered musical jumble that was the nineties, this cd brought it all home for me with his poignant lyrics and stripped-down arrangements.  After all, it's about the songs, not the hype.  The stories he tells are as amazing as anything Dylan or other troubadors like Waits and Prine have ever written.  Everyone I turned on to this recording was spellbound by its sincerity and simplicity.  It stands the test of time.
0140277447|5.0|I will suppress my hatred and treat Japanese people nicely.  I will ask for nothing in return but remembering what your cruel army had done to us Chinese!
0140277447|5.0|It is really ironical that some guys here talking about china's propagand. Every year Japnese wanna the whole world memorize the Atom Bomb fell in its two cities. Let me tell you something, that is propagand. Do you know why? The bombs were not dropped there by chance, it was because of the crimes Japan conducted to many countries during WWII instead. Did Japan memorize the crimes during that day?  <br />Now you have the idea who is propaganding.

B0000C172X|4.0|This is a really great album by Neil Young but this DVD-Audio Edition is STEREO only! DVD-Audio allows for multiple versions of the same disc, usually a Surround Mix and a Stereo Mix - but this ONLY has a stereo one. <br /> <br />Also, the quality isn't that much of an improvement over the CD (having listened to it too) probably because it was remastered at the same time. <br /> <br />And just beware, unlike SACDs you can't play these in regular CD players. You can in a DVD player to get a CD quality recording.

I do not want to describe it just because you can find the whole script in other reviews. But this movie is amazing. It i simple and plain but so sweet. Nice actors and wonderful sound track. And even though it's unrated, everything is so natural that I can't even imagine what rated version could be - I guess it looses a lot and that could explain some 1-star reviews (\\"learn to like it\\"):o) <br />It's like a fairy tale and you should watch it that way. <br />I do not buy lots of DVDs but this one is gonna be part of my collection.
0140277447|5.0|I am saddened at Iris Chang's recent death.  She was truly a brilliant young historian who courageously told the story of Japanese atrocities in China during WW2.  This story, up until now, received little attention in the United States.  This I could never understand. Yet Ms. Chang, through her relentless research, has uncovered a gruesome and horrific part of human history and told it to the world. I am very disturbed by all the comments written on this forum by people who claim these stories are communist China (PRC) propaganda. Hardly.  The Chinese in Taiwan (ROC), PRC's archenemy, share the same views on these irrefutable facts of East Asian history.  I don't blame the Japanese people and others on this forum,who seem to be using this book review section as their personal blog to argue WW2 facts (some of whom have submitted multiple entries).Perhaps, they are ignorant and misinformed.  Perhaps, they just can't accept that the ugliness demonstrated by the Japanese may be a part of them.
1401301363|5.0|Nigella Lawson's `Feast' is as much a feast for the mind as it is a resource for feasts of the body. Ms. Lawson loves to write about cooking and she does it very, very well. Even without knowing that she does weekly columns for the very well written New York Times, one can tell that unlike her equally famous Anglo culinarian Jamie Oliver, she does not dictate her books into a recorder to be transcribed by an editor.<br /><br />I got Ms. Lawson's latest volume to both review it and to expect that it will provide a good resource for Thanksgiving and Christmas meals, a resource which will survive more holiday winters than the molding stack of `Gourmet', `Bon Appetit', and `Martha Stewart Living' issues from holidays past. My slight hesitation based on a relatively poor opinion of her `Forever Summer' volume was overcome by Ms. Lawson's cheeky appearance on the David Letterman show where she upstaged Dave with a quip which I suspect will appear in best of collections for years to come.<br /><br />Speaking of Ms. Stewart, many have been nominated as successors to Martha's mantle of domestic arbiter of taste, but I think Ms. Lawson should be considered clearly ahead of the pack as an improvement over Ms. Stewart's take on food and cooking. In lieu of a clever metaphor, I will simply state that while Martha Stewart and staff gives solid advice on the basics and are almost always sound on the facts, very little real personality and passion shines through the slightly make believe feeling one gets from Martha's persona. Nigella Lawson is both a very real, very genuine intellect who takes us beyond competence to really caring about making a good meal for friends and family.<br /><br />Ms. Lawson's chatter and recipes for Thanksgiving are a perfect case in point. After noting that as a Brit, Thanksgiving is `not her party, but she is always happy to be invited'. And, to clearly justify her invitation, she states that Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other holiday meals are very much about tradition, and it would be foolish to deal with recipes that do not follow these traditions. So, she gives us two recipes for roasted turkey (one traditional and one with a brined bird), two recipes for turkey gravy, three recipes for poultry stuffing, a recipe for baked ham, a recipe for goose with a mashed potato stuffing, a `bohemian' roast goose, and a red cabbage recipe. The side dishes include pancetta wrapped sausages; maple roasted parsnips; perfect roast potatoes; sweet potatoes with marshmallows (oh my); Brussels sprouts with chestnuts, pancetta, and parsley; green bean and lemon casserole; bread sauce and cranberry sauce.<br /><br />All this goodness would be wasted if the recipes are not good, and I believe they are very, very good. The attention to cooking details surpasses virtually all other works I have seen on this subject. About a year ago, a Sheila Lukins book, `Celebrate' with a very similar agenda was published with menus covering over thirty celebratory events with lots of recipes, drink recommendations, and listening recommendations, but the book was primarily a good, easy reference for people who simply wanted to get a few easy tips for fleshing out events for family and friends. The recipes were sound, but simply not very deep. Ms. Lawson, on the other hand, gives us turkey-roasting instructions which look like they were copied from a book by Thomas Keller. The procedure for Lawson's turkey is almost identical to Keller's instructions for roasting a chicken in his new book `Bouchon'. Similarly, her instructions for the `perfect roast potatoes' are both careful and distinctive, from the very specific instructions on parboiling the spuds to the method for cutting them to get the best crunchy outside and pillowy inside. The goose fat for the roasting is a nice touch too.<br /><br />While Ms. Lawson only covers 22 occasions to Ms. Lukins' 35, Nigella pretty much covers just about every common event you can imagine. Joining Thanksgivingand Christmas are menus and recipes for New Year, Vegetarian celebrations, Valentine's Day, Easter, Passover, Breakfast celebrations, `Kitchen Feasts', `Kiddiefeast', celebratory cookies, chocolate birthday cakes, `A Georgian Feast', EID (Eid-ul-Fitr, a Muslim breaking of fasting feast), Ultimate Feasts (read `Last Supper'), Halloween, Rosh Hashanah, `A Venetian Feast', Festival of Lights, Partytime, Midnight Feast, and Funeral Feast. In addition to digging deeper into culinary wisdom than Ms. Lukins or Ms. Stewart, Lawson is much more ecumenical in covering Christian, Jewish, and Moslem celebrations not to mention coverage of menus from Russia and Venice.<br /><br />I should also say that while Ms. Lawson makes no compromises with culinary excellence, her recipes require very few difficult or unusual methods or ingredients. Comparing her Georgian recipe for walnut crescents with a Rick Rodgers essay from Austrian coffee houses shows that Lawson gives us a much simpler method to reach a very similar result.<br /><br />Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver share a passion for food and for communicating with food, which have few if any peers among us Yanks. Ms. Lawson says `I believe absolutely that the only way to live is to throw yourself right at it'. No holding back here, I'd say. She is a culinary Al Franken to Oliver's Robin Williams. Just as Franken is a very intellectual humorist, Ms. Lawson warms the scholar in my soul by giving full credit to those people from whom she has borrowed. Food talk is invariably a discussion and not a monologue. Ms. Lawson brings a very clear, warm, passionate voice to the party.<br /><br />Very highly recommended as a foodie read AND a source of entertaining recipes for many different occasions.nksgiving and Christmas are menus and recipes for New Year, Vegetarian celebrations, Valentine's Day, Easter, Passover, Breakfast celebrations, `Kitchen Feasts', `Kiddiefeast', celebratory cookies, chocolate birthday cakes, `A Georgian Feast', EID (Eid-ul-Fitr, a Muslim breaking of fasting feast), Ultimate Feasts (read `Last Supper'), Halloween, Rosh Hashanah, `A Venetian Feast', Festival of Lights, Partytime, Midnight Feast, and Funeral Feast.

B0006284JQ|4.0|To everyone who is complaining about Britney's record label putting out a greatest hits CD: Dont buy it. I figure, for the 10 dollars I paid for it, I got exactly what I wanted. I'm not exactly the biggest Britney fan in the world and I know she certainly isnt the greatest singer out there, but this CD is perfect for the \\"not really a britney fan.\\" its got all her fun early stuff, her dance-inspired later music, and its all together. I'd much rather put money down to have all her hits on one CD than shelling out money for four different ones and have to sit through hours of filler music and sappy ballads.  <br /> <br />Also, I love the bonus CD with the remixes of Toxic, Outrageous, etc. I can't get the \\"breathe on me\\" remix out of my head, which is a good thing. Personally I've been listening to this CD more than the main one. I couldn't give this album 5 stars b/c some of the songs are kind of cheesy and Britney's voice just sounds over processed, but as a whole its definately fun.
B000002GBK|1.0|Some things unfortunately just do NOT age well, and Rick Wakeman's overblown take on King Arthur and The Knights Of The Round Table does so very painfully. <br /> <br />Flush from his success with the \\"Journey To The Center of The Earth\\" tour, Wakey decided to approach an equally grandiose subject. However, in his quest to do so, he got a little too full of himself, a few pints and no small amount of Broadway-style cheese-wiz that would probably embarass Andrew Lloyd-Webber (as if THAT were actually possible). And as if that weren't excreable enough, he wanted to tour with an Ice-Capades production in addition to the orchestra and chorus (this however was short circuited, thankfully).   <br /> <br />End result, some of the CORNIEST, STOOOOPIDEST lyrics you ever heard in your life (they make \\"Hello Dolly\\" sound like Shakespeare by comparison) that permeate nearly ALL the tracks, save for the largely instrumental \\"Merlin The Magician\\" though this has cheese- whiz issues of its own, trying to jump to every musical style it can in the space of 6 or 7 minutes). The proceedings are NOT helped in any fashion by Ashley Holt's abysmal vocalizing (heck, William Shatner could outsing him and at least be somewhat entertaining) and the rather pedestrian band (although the orchetra and choir do get to flex their muscles periodically) as Wakey lets forth Mini-Moog and piano assaults aplenty. There are odd musical moments though that actually threaten to get good and interesting but that is QUICKLY dealt a death blow when the Broadway/Stage impulses take over.  <br /> <br />With the lone exception of \\"Six Wives of Henry The VIII\\", Wakey has NEVER been able to compose anything meaningfully deep or substantial, sounding more like Romantic/Post- Romantic period cliches strung together with other odd bits. He can play his keys like a fiend and contribute colorful passages in the confines of Yes, he can wear the coolest capes on the planet, but the boy CANNOT WRITE! <br /> <br />You want high-concept hijinks that are actually FUN? May I suggest William Shatner's \\"The Transformed Man\\" (at least it was FUNNY!). This thing however just takes itself WAAAAAAAAAAAYYY too seriously and tries to overcompensate with bombastic cheese whiz (I'm just glad he didn't attempt a collaboration with Elvis on a redux of \\"Hamlet\\"). <br /> <br />Best used for extracting confessions from criminals or getting rid of unwanted party guests. Otherwise, steer clear.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I walked out of the theater like someone had punched me in the gut. Or like the air had been let out of my tires. I am a fanatic fan. I have read and re-read the entire series. This movie just wasn't done well. I didn't like the new doumbledore. I didn't like the new set location castle hagrids hut ect... However, the kids are getting better at acting. I had waited over two years and I almost left the theater in tears. They left way to much out and people who haven't read the books have to clue as what is going on.... just my thoughts!
0140277447|5.0|Japan should learn from Germany and stop denying their crime during WW2. Now they even say their purpose in the WW2 was to \\"help\\" other Asian countries. What a BS.  <br />And don't forget they also try to \\"help\\" the US, don't forget the Pearl Harbor. <br />I am glad US finally \\"help\\" them to stop their crime with 2 bombs. And I hope if they continue to act like this, they will receive more, from angry victim countries. <br />
B000003FMY|5.0|One of the first legendary RCA \\"Living Stero\\" recordings, almost 50 years later and it has not lost its power to inspire and move. This is the definitive recording of this piece of music. Everything said about the orchestra and the conductor is true. However, a reminder about the particular piece of music. <br /> <br />One of the most powerful of all creative urges is to memoralize. <br />The results can range from the mundane cliches of commonality found in many of the statues in our parks and cities to the awe inspring works such as Mount Rushmore. Yet, perhaps the most powerful creations are those which try to overcome a grievous personal loss by immortalizing the evanescent.  Modeste Mussorgsky wrote Pictures at an Exhibition to perpetuate the memory of a dear friend, Victor Hartmann, an architect who died suddenly at the wripe age of 39. Mussorgsky was devastated. A year later a memorial exhibition of Hartmann's drawings, and paintings went on display. Mussorgsky attended this exhibition and was inspired and moved by what he saw. The result was a piano piece that sought to invoke inspiration from 10 of the pictures he saw there. While wonderful, it lay neglected for many years. It was not until 1922 at the request of the Boston Conducter Serge Koussavitsky, that Ravel unleashed the true power of the music by orchestrating it. With the help of Ravel's artful orchestration, which today this piece is required study in most music orchestration courses, the music created rises to the level of achievemenet far more massive and lasting than the  subject that inspired it. <br />Pictures at An Exhibition is inspiring,frightening, tender, sad,happy, etc. The music invokes all ranges of moods and colors. It is a showcase for musicianship with wonderful displays of virtuosity in the brass (especially trumpet, and tuba)but equally in the other areas of the orchestra. <br /> <br />But above all else the music is a tribute to an endearing friendship between two artists who shared a common vision and nationalist pride for their country. One of the greatest pieces of classical music written. Period!

B00005JNEI|5.0|Fantastic! I just saw both \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" on video. They are the best movies that I have ever seen. Even though they were documentaries they were edge-of-the-seat entertainment. When you are deeply engrossed in this movie you will wish it never ends!!! You will wish Michael could just go on and on with his inimitable style....About the \\"factual basis\\" of this movie..The camera never lies! To all those who criticize Michael: I guess the truth hurts!!! Oh yes, in both movies Michael exposes the hypocrisy and double-standards that  exists around here and is well-known all over the world...I guess the truth hurts like hell, dear critics!!
B00028HBKC|1.0|I wish I could have rated this movie with no stars. <br />It is like the Columbine Massacre for Christians. <br />It should be banned. <br />Jesus, the Christ, is much more deserving of holy respect than what he receives from the hack job of this violent video game produced by Mel Gibson. <br />If you want scarey blood and gore, buy the Exorcist.

At the time it was great but now i'm just sick of it. To me, for an album to be called classic it shouldn't get old, but this music has not stood the test of time. I feel the same, even more so for the pathetic Use Your Illusion duo.  I still have these cd's from when they first came out, and there they sit, gathering dust. A sure sign. O.K. Fire Away!

B00006J3WH|5.0|let's admit, sometimes it's hard to convert someone into a Buffy fan. but i've introduced many friends to the Buffyverse by showing them the musical episode...and so begins the addiction.<br /><br />lots of reviewers complain that the actors cannot sing well.  they're missing the point.  their CHARACTERS are not professionally trained!  do you really think Xander or Willow has ever taken a voice lesson?  the whole premise of the episode is that they are under Sweet's spell and sing unintentionally.  while some of the actor's voices are not professional quality, ALL of the actors did an amazing job...even Alyson Hannigan.  Amber Benson and Tony Head are excellent throughout the CD, but during the reprise of \\"Under Your Spell\\", in which they sing counterpart, they just nail the emotion of leaving Buffy and Willow.<br /><br />an admitted Buffy-fanatic, i even bought the episode's script and sheet music book, i love it that much.  Joss rocks out the best show on television!
1401301363|5.0|Nigella Lawson's \\"Feast\\" is a fabulous cookbook for most people, not just those about to prepare a Thanksgiving Dinner (though it is great for them too).  <br /> <br />\\"Feast\\" celebrates Lawson's unique take on cooking and on life. She is a strong proponent of being comfortable in your own kitchen and at your own party. She eschews \\"perfectionism\\" (e.g., perfect flowers as centerpieces, exquisite appetizers) for good, home cooked food and comfort.  <br /> <br />Lawson's definition of a feast has breadth and depth. This book includes sections on the traditional Holidays both secular and non-secular (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Hannukah, Eid-Muslim, Halloween). However, she also has suggestions for a \\"One Person Feast\\" or a \\"Venetian Feast\\" (which would make for a great dinner party)and other such events. MOST notably, she includes a section on a feast for a funeral with thoughtful suggestions on food to bring to the home of the bereaved.  <br /> <br />Lawson's cookbooks can be read as books. In fact, I recommend that's how you begin with \\"Feast\\": read it from cover to cover. Her prose is witty, sly and friendly. You feel as if she's standing there in the kitchen with you. <br /> <br />Finally, the recipes are terrific. You'll find great soups that you can use anywhere (you may want to rename the Halloween \\"slime soup\\" but you can serve it in the summer), wonderful suggestions for roasts (e.g., roiled loin of pork cinghiale, Georgian chicken), side dishes (brussel sprouts with chestnuts and pancetta), and desserts ( a flourless chocolate orange cake) that can be used any day and any time of year, feast or no feast.  <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough to lovers of food and cooking everywhere.
B000002C25|5.0|In its own right this album is a 5 star rating. <br /> <br />It may not be brilliant like their first two albums, but in its own way it is brilliant. <br />Its very long and very loud and just a completely different sounding album to there first two albums. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009W0U4|4.0|Webster difines nightmares as an event or experience that is intensely distressing. I don't think Webster ever saw Irreversible, but he pretty much nailed it right on the head. A friend had me watch the movie when I was staying with him one weekend. Thinking I could take anything I agreed even after his warnings. How bad could this be? Boy was I wrong. From the opening shot of the old men talking above the s&m club, to the club itself. This movie did not stop. Every one who has given a review has pretty much given the plot outline, so I will not do that. What I will do is tell you that after seeing this film I didn't know if I hated it, or if it was my new favorite movie. I felt dirty for days and for being a man. I felt gulity for not turning away from the rape scene, but much like a car crash, you just have to keep watching. Irreverible is brilliant in sense that it is able to make you feel, and 99% of the time those feelings are not what you would expect from just a film. What is also so amazing about this movie is the soundtrack: the reverse bass that bumps and gets into your stomach. It is an all out attack on the senses. Sometimes isn't nice to be shocked though?     A follow up:  As a joke I asked for the film for Christmas from my polyanna at work. I did not think that I would really get it but I did. So, I came home and put it in my DVD player. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen it. I don't know what I was thinking, but I watched it alone; not the best idea. On my second viewing I noticed some things I had not the first time. What effected me wasn't what I had missed, but that upon my second time seeing the movie, it was still able to make me feel the same way it did the first time. I have not watched it since, and I don't think I will for a long time. Not because it is a bad film--not in the least, but it is draining.     Not a good date movie
B00006M183|2.0|How can anybody who likes Pearl Jam music actually like this album. <br />Can't Keep is a good first track for the album, the rest is just really bland. <br /> <br />Some of the songs sound like they have potential, but the songs are just really dull and boring. <br />Eddie Vedders singing is shocking. <br />The way the songs were performed on Binaural was apalling as well. <br />To realise this all you have to do is compare there last two albums with the ones that came before that. <br /> <br />The last Pearl Jam album that had good songs music on that was performed well was \\"Yield.\\" <br /> <br />
0140277447|5.0|\\"Regardless of the discrepancies in numbers or the level of objectivity of Ms. Chang's work, the fact remains that the Japanese soldiers' atrocities against the Chinese DID happen\\". If a few Japanese claim the number is 200,000 instead of 300,000, it will make them feel better. It will make you deny the atrocities of Japanese soldier did to Chinese civilians. The truth is IT HAPPENED. There are a lot of thing you can't deny. You can't deny Japan aggression in WW II. No one invited Japanese soldier to enter China. Today, a few Japanese try to deny the Nanking massacre. Which massacre will be the next? Ping DingShan massacre? Liu Sun massacre? Or unit 731 biological weapon on live Chinese civilians? The unit 516 used the chemical weapon that had forbidden by international law before WW II. Even today, there are a lot chemical weapon in china abandoned by Japanese soldier after WW II. So the key point of a few Japanese is they want to act themselves as the victims of WW II because of the two nuclear bombs. They knew the truth. They might know the massacre more clearly than us so they are eager to deny because they fear the truth, they fear when the bottle is open, they can't keep their \\"noble\\" any more. The history is history. IT HAPPENED, no one has right to change it. FACE it. Act as a true man like the Germany government did after WW II. DON'T act as coward hiding in the shadow counts number by using your finger and mutter you just killed four people instead of five. FACE IT and ask for forgive from Asian People due to Japanese soldier did in WW II. If not, I have to say, the Japanese DID deserve the two nuclear bombs.

B0000CFW87|2.0|I can no longer hold my peace amidst this ever increasing Josh Groban hoopla! <br /> <br />What is it that has people so taken with this guy? <br />I am by no means an opera puritst or a pop music freak...I happen to be very well rounded musically, enoying anything from Jazz to Country to Soul to some Hip-Hop to Opera and much more. <br />So its not that I'm stuck on one type of sound and won't accept anything but what I like. <br />I even appraciate music that I don't personally like...such as alternative rock and such...I appreciate it for it's own unique essence. <br />I simply don't get this kid nor the outright worship of media and public of him. <br /> <br />I've bought both of his CD's...and gave both away. <br />I've even heard people refer to him as a tenor and in the same breath as Bocelli! <br />Groban is neither a tenor or even close to anything operactic...or pop-operatic even. <br /> <br />Granted he as a nice voice, he'd do well on Broadway but this pop icon status that's being bestowed upon him these days is rediculous. <br />Another thing that irritates me is that his fans give him credit for \\"his\\" songs. <br />Has anyone ever bothered to actually check as to who writes those songs which, by the way, border on the inane and outright boring? <br />It's NOT their beloved Josh. <br />Which is just as well because if he were to write his own songs they'd likely be of similar schlock quality. <br /> <br />I appreciate talent, but this kid and this CD are simply not THAT great. Good on some level yes...but come on. <br /> <br />Take his version of the immortal \\"Caruso\\". I have heard this song perfromed by anyone from Bocelli to Pavarotti to Amante and this is by and far the worst of all versions to date! <br />For one it's keyed so low that the late Melvin Franklin of the Temptations could have easily sung it and he was one of the greatest BASS singers ever! <br />Yet people rave about this mess like it's the second coming of the mythical savior. <br /> <br />Or take the over played \\"You raise me up\\" or something like that... <br />It sounds like a knock off of Vince Gills' \\"Go rest high up on that mountain\\". <br /> <br />I gave this Cd 2 stars instead of 1 because he does have a nice voice...like I said, I appreciate talent even if it's not my cup of tea. <br /> <br />To each his/her own and Josh to his millions and millions of fans...but not for me. No thank you. <br />Groban stay \\"Closer\\" indeed...closer to the furthest point away from me that is. <br />
B00005JNEU|3.0|I have a strong taste for realistic movies, but I must say that \\"Friday Night Lights\\" almost brought me to tears. The most heartwrenching scene is when Derek Luke (who plays the self-confident and talented \\"Boobie\\" Miles) knows his season, and time playing football is over, and goes to clean out his locker. He's all smiles, and confidence, telling his teammates to be perfect and win. But as soon as he walks outside the school, and joins his uncle in his car, he breaks down. Football is all I have, he cries, it's all I can do, and his uncle holds him. I have rarely seen such a powerful scene. I don't cry at movies, but I fought to hold in tears. Derek Luke is a largely overrated actor and deserves to be a star. I've seen reviews that unforgivingly didn't even mention his name among the cast. The other sad, moving storyline is that of the second-string running back, whose abusive, alcoholic father is played by singer Tim McGraw. What this film doesn't have is a happy ending, and cliche-ridden sports formulas that sink most sports movies. It's all the more powerful for that. It's a bleak, almost depressing movie because you know for the vast majority of kids in this rural town (that lives precariously through high school kids who are expected to play to perfection) are going to go nowhere, to sink into working class lives. Weeks later after seeing it, I still can't shake the images and sounds of seeing Billingsley and Miles struggling under the weight of expectation and knowing they most likely live in a dead-end town.

B00005JNDX|5.0|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason<br /><br />This is no average romantic comedy. Strap yourself in for the riotous laughter that ensues in this comedy featuring the ever-talented Renee Zelleweger. Friends and enemies, old and new, throw in some truly unexpected twists and turns in this sequel to the extremely successful Bridget Jones' Diary. Watching the film is like catching up with an old friend. Scenes are put together like little vignettes drawn from her now infamous diary (which only makes one appearance in the film strangely enough). The filmmakers expect that you have seen the first one and are delivering fans all the Bridget they can handle. Viewers of the first film will feel as if they are on all the \\"in\\" jokes... as they play up all of Bridget's endearing neuroses... from her \\"appalling bad public speaking\\" to her relationship with the \\"scary stomach holding-in panties popular with grannies the world over\\".<br /><br />Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is totally off the \\"hot\\" charts in playing the leading man. He lets it all hang out personality-wise and romantically in the Edge of Reason. If you're not swooning over him already, this film will certainly put you over the edge! And Mr. Cleaver (Hugh Grant) does not disappoint as the boyish cad that we all hate to love, or is it love to hate?<br /><br />The movie bets on its female fans having had a relationship with their own \\"Daniel Cleaver\\" and the scenes between Daniel and Bridget will make you squirm in your seat. Watching this movie is like being at a pajama party! You will laugh, squirm, yell and be driven to the edge of your seat and feel good doing it because so will everyone else in the theater. The movie is not so much about trials and tribulations of single-hood, it is about the pitfalls of the relationship decisions we make and how we can bond as women because of them. And this experience is reflected in the audience it brings together.<br /><br />Women bond with Bridget because they know what she is going through and fans will continue to enjoy that relationship with the new movie. That's half of what makes the scenes so downright hilarious (the other half is Zelleweger's comedic talent). As for the guys, don't worry, there's a scene at the end that will make it all worthwhile for them.<br /><br />What is lackluster about the film is that it is not as structured as the first, and Zelleweger starts it off a little weakly with a fuzzy accent in the beginning. Some fans might find that the smarminess subtracts from the experience and there is too much unfortunate mimicking of the original that came off a little forced. You won't really notice the relative lack of scene set up in this one because you will be too busy laughing and the filmmakers continue with some beautiful scenery and an excellent soundtrack.<br /><br />This movie has a hard time being at all serious but don't we all need a laugh (or two or three hundred) these days? The Edge of Reason is a must see for any true Bridget fan; it does not disappoint. It will take you to the edge of your seat and make you laugh like no other film this year. 4 ½ stars.she is going through and fans will continue to enjoy that relationship with the new movie.

037542217X|4.0|THE NO.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY was such an original and winning debut, that the subsequent novels in the series at best can only live up to it.  There is no matching the surprises with which that first book was loaded, especially in terms of its characters, its setting, its wonderful voice and wit, its story structure.  The good news is that Alexander McCall Smith does not betray what he has set up and he continues to use it to good effect in the 4th volume, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, this is a series set in Botswana, Africa, in which the estimable Mma Precious Ramotswe has set up a detective agency.  This is not your standard mystery formula.  The series relies more on the puzzles of human interactions and weaknesses in a traditional society that is rapidly adapting the first world frame of mind.  This time around, Mma Ramotswe tangles with slick competition, while her assistant, the surprising Mma Makutsi, takes a more central role.  The various strands of stories come together with Dickensian coincidences, but the author has already snatched your disbelief at the door so you don't care.  THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL has its comic moments which are not at odds with its wise reflections.  My only criticism of this volume is that the author does not devote the time to exploring his original characters, Mma Ramotswe or her fianc&eacute;, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, that he gives to Mma Makutsi.  He has recovered the deeper sense of the country that went missing in MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, but not to the depth of the first book in the series.

0140861785|5.0|A Christmas Carol is a Dickens classic whose story has held true throughout the ages. A Christmas Carol should ideally be read. After you have read the book you should buy this audio rendition. Geoffrey Palmer is not only an excellent actor but has a terrific voice for narration. Dicken's has a way with words that makes it easy to the reader/listener to imagine the setting. Palmer builds on this with his rendition of the story, where you can truly experience the old fashioned dickensian christmas era. Unlike other narrators that summarize this classic, Palmer reads straight from the novel so if you have the book you can follow line by line. The story is told across two audio tapes. I noticed that amazon.co.uk has just released this rendition on CD, so hopefully the CD will be available in the US soon. <br />

And rightfully delivered, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" storms its way out of your stereo with its grinding piano and haunting vocals.  Followed by the single \\"Time Is Running Out\\", the album continues into a steady stream of experimental alternative music that can only be defined as amazing. Not a song disappoints here; be it soft or pounding perhaps the album should have been named after the song \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes.\\"  Perfect.

Heard \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" over and over at a beach bar:  perfect relaxtion, and every time I here that song it brings me back to that warm, beautiful place.  Had to pick up the album after that.  And very good purchase might I add.    Like R+B music in general, but havent really been a fan of an individual album in a while until now. There's soul, funk, rhythm, and blues. And Timbaland! One of the best albums of the year!  Standout tracks: (the singles, especially \\"Karma\\"); \\"If I Was Your Woman\\"; \\"Heartburn\\"
0140277447|5.0|Nanking is also Nanjing in Mandarin Chinese. When Japan invaded China, Japnanese troops kill over a million Chinese people in Nanking in less than a week.  <br /> <br />Please dont forget about Japanese WWII criminal legacy.  The Rape of Nanking(Nanjing) is only one of the many crimes that the Japan committed in China, Korea, and other parts of Asia.   <br /> <br />I think it's unfair that schools in the US only teach about Holocaust but fail to educate our youth about Japanese crimes and brutality.  Not only were there rapes and massacre, the Japanese also tested biochem weapons on Chinese people in the north eastern provinces of China.   <br /> <br />The Japanese have not appologized for their crimes nor have they shown any effort to atone for their evil doings.  Japanese officials still visit Shrines dedicated to Jap WWII criminals.  Furthermore, the Japanese recently changed their history book to distort history, calling the Japanese invasion a \\"Liberation\\".  Outrageous!!!    <br /> <br />Japan recently have asked for a permanant seat in the Security Coucil in the UN (there are now 5 permant seats, China, England, France, Russia, US, all winner of wwII).  Some 25 countries even supported Japan's effort to obtain that seat.  Unbelievable.  IMO, Germany has done a much better job of atoning for what Nazi Germany did to the Jews.  And Germany has educated their youth about their wwII wrong-doings while Japan has tried to distort the truth.  Wrong!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Being an island country, Japan has sought to expand numerous times, invading Korea.  In the late 1800s when the Chinese(Qing) Government was weak, Japan forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan.  Still today, Japan still involves in territory dispute with China over DiaoYu Island(not far from Taiwan).  DiaoYu Islands belong to China and was ceded to Japan  along with Taiwan after China lost a war to Japan in the late 1800s.  Taiwan was returned to China after WWII in the San Francisco Treaty, but the US mistakenly left out DiaoYu Islands in the agreement.   <br /> <br />Judging from the above, we can see that the Japanese stil maintain their WWII mentality.  Hence, I believe that not only should Japan not be granted a seat in the UN security coucil, economic sanctions should be placed on Japan for failing to admit and atone for their criminal legacy in asia and aggresive tendencies still today.   <br /> <br />It is sad that the author of the Rape of Nanking has deceased.      I would like to thank her for making an effort to educate our youths about the past, something that our school system has failed to do.  Furthermore, I would like to ask you to let more  people know about Japan's crimes in Asia.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Masterpiece. The word has never been so well applied to an art form than when it comes to \\"Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2\\". I am a serious movie buff and I think it goes without saying that I loved this movie. It is definitely a movie buff's movie. Packed to the hilt with references to the chop-socky kung-fu flicks of days past, this movie delivers everything you want and would ever come to expect from the auteur that is Quentin Tarantino.  <br /> <br />The story goes like this. The Bride (Uma Thurman) was a part of a gang of international assassins called the DiVAS (the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad), whose teammates were Vernita Green, O-Ren Ishii, Elle Driver, and Budd (played by Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen, respectively.) They are led by Bill (David Carradine, never seen, only heard).  <br />The writing is excellent (as always), the dialogue exchange between The Bride and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox is wonderful in the brief screen time she has) is razor-sharp. The choice of opening credits music is absolutely perfect; it fits the mood of the film thus far very, very well. I love a good action movie, but they are usually brainless fluff pieces with buff men blowing things up left and right. But I got a serious kick out of an intelligent film where the hero was a heroine. Uma Thurman is pitch perfect in creating The Bride to be as real a person as possible. She is running away from a violent past, but it caught up to her. Now, they all have hell to pay. The scene in the hospital after she realizes what's been taken from her consists mostly of silence, then screaming sobs. Its pretty heart-wrenching stuff. The soundtrack to the whole movie fits like a glove. Pieces from spaghetti Westerns, old disco music, cues from classic film scores, all of it works perfectly in the film (\\"Twisted Nerve\\" works especially well in showing a possible demise of our heroine).  <br /> <br />The whole movie bounces back and forth through time. For those who don't like this type of storytelling, abandon this page and look for something more linear. It shows the past, then the future, then the past, then the present. She has all her victims on a list and checks them off one by one (only two are picked off in this half) as she treks across the globe to get to them. Lucy Liu is absolutely poisonous as O-Ren Ishii. And Elle...well, let's leave evaluating Elle for a review of Volume 2. In-jokes abound, as many references as Tarantino could fit into the film, incredibly choreographed fight scenes (the House of Blue Leave sequence will leave you breathless), and just the fact that they made samurai swords cool again all add up to one of the best films ever made. And its all, essentially, from very small pieces of other cheesy films. Taking the best of the worst can create the best of the best. The Bride takes out the worst of the worst and eventually rampages on to become a pop culture icon for the new millennium. Admit it, girls....even guys, you know you wanted to be The Bride for just 10 minutes.
B00006BTCA|5.0|.. are probably the most cruel thing you could do to a band at this stage in their career. Can you imagine if Sonic Youth was thrown away for sounding like the Velvet Underground, REM trashed in reviews for sounding like the Bryds or U2 for occasionally coming off similar to the Stones. You could even deny Bob Dylans talent if you wanted to and say he got everything he knew from Woody Guthrie, but no one does. That being said this album should be taken as it is. Sure at times Banks' voice resemble's Curtis' but thats about it. After listening to this album over and over I never once heard a bass riff similar to anything of Peter Hook. Just another quick example. When i went to see the Cure at Curiosa I was in the pit and there i met several older fans who could have cared less about the bands coming on before the Cure, one of them being Interpol. Most trashed them saying \\"get the Cure out here we dont want to here cheap Joy Division\\", and other stuff along those lines. Then just a couple weeks ago at the Interpol show at the Electric factory almost everyone who trashed them at Curiosa was up front with me at the show. <br /> <br />Upon first listen the obvious standouts are the PDA, NYC, and Obstacle 1. However looking back, after each listen and after hearing Obstacle 1 in almost a million vh1 or mtv comercials it is clear that PDA is the stronger track. It featurs a strong back beat and brilliantly ringing guitars juxtaposed against a memorable vocal. NYC likewise rings but in different manner almost like October era U2. However, those are cetainly not the only stunning tracks on the album, Stella, arguably their best song, runs the longest and is worth every minute of it and the New, running along the same spiraling line is just as good. As time passes it is likely that this album will only appear more unique, especially compared to the majority of music right now.
0140277447|1.0|She died today. I don't know if it's coincidental or not that she committed <br />suicide after suffering some years of a deep depression.   <br /> <br />To me, Iris Chang's book is probably on the same page as Hitler, if not worse.   <br />Did she kill several million Jews? No. But the hate that she incites from  <br />her books is astounding.  <br /> <br />Her book describes the tragedy of how Japanese people treated the Chinese <br />during their World War II invasion.  How cruel the Japanese people were, <br />etc. Were the Japanese evil? Yes. Are the Japanese evil? I don't know and <br />I really don't care. And I gurantee you that there are a lot of Japanese <br />youth that share my same opinion. Her book started some movement to  <br />demand reparations from Japan for Chinese families that suffered. <br />Now is there anything wrong with that? I'll let you decide that.  <br /> <br />But there are several things I would like to know: <br />Where is the book that talk about how the Chinese treated their own people? <br /> <br />Where is the the reparation for that? THERE IS NONE.   <br /> <br />While there may still be Japanese soldiers alive from WWII, today - <br />WWII has very little to do with the current Japanese society.  WWII <br />isn't going to happen again.  <br /> <br />We shouldn't forget what happened - but at the same time, we don't <br />need to write books like this to incite hate towards the Japanese people. <br />Do you honestly think that people are going to read this book or the <br />freaking back cover of this book and not generalize? There will be <br />at least one person that will generalize their hatred towards <br />Japanese people from that.  <br /> <br /> <br />Books like these are propaganda. Propaganda has nothing to do with <br />facts.  You can quote facts all day and it won't change propaganda. <br />Propaganda is misusing facts for a cause.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Amazing.  The book, too.  I even read Amy Tan's newest nonfiction book, where she discusses the painful yet rewarding process of creating this movie.  It's not far-fetched because much of it is based on real-life stories that occurred to her mother and aunties.
B0002XNSY0|3.0|This is a great move, a classic.  However, this version is not recommended.  Instead get the earlier \\"Special Edition\\" release, also available from Amazon.  I make this recommendation for three reasons.   <br /> <br />First, it's less expensive and you still get a good print with most of the extra features.   <br /> <br />Second, Dr. Strangelove was not filmed at a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.  While \\"Letterboxing\\" or a Widescreen presentation will give you more of the image than the TV screen shaped 1.33:1 ratio, it will do so only if the movie was originally filmed at a wider ratio.  If it was filmed at the 1.33 ratio and you present it in a wider ratio, the only way to do that withou having the image seem distorted is to cut off part of the top and bottom of the picture.  That's what was done for this release, a major mistake.   <br /> <br />Third, one of the things you're paying for is an interview with Robert McNamara.  For those of you who are too young to know, he was about the worst Secretary of Defense the country ever had.  He kept making wrong calls after wrong calls, misreading the Soviet Union, creating tension when it was unecessary, building weapns that weren't needed and blocking ones that worked if they didn't suit him and was the architect of the disasterous strategy of how we fought the Vietnam War that needlessly prolonged the conflict and was responsible for tens of thoushands of deaths on both sides (ie don't be concerned about military necessity or sensiblity, just keep track of the \\"body count\\" to determine effectiveness;  Don't attack enemy missile sites while they're under construction, wait until they have been finished and are firing and blowing planes out of the sky).  This was a man who had no concern about people or what was happening, but simply looked at the War as a way to feed his ego.  In the last 10 years he has been trying to rehabilitate himself by pretending that he was really against the war at the same time as he was micromanaging it.   <br /> <br />What relevance does this have to this review?  Simply that Robert McNamara is not qualified to comment on what was going on in the Cold War at the time because he was is more concerned with his \\"legacy\\" than telling it like it was.  So, why waste your money paying for a commentary by him?  Get the previous \\"Special Edition of this superb movie.  You lose nothing and save some money.
B000002H33|4.0|Man. It had been about two years since I'd listened to this album. I'd forgotten just how good most of the songs are. Sure, some aren't exactly top 'o the heap, but most are excellent. BUY! BUY! BUY!
0767812166|5.0|Briefly:  This movie is as good as virtually everyone else says it is.  Keep one thing in mind, though:  This movie is essentially a remake of \\"E.T.\\" with a romance added.  Alien trapped on earth.  Humans hide him out.  Has to contact home.  Must get to rendezvous.  Good Gov't agents and bad Gov't agents.  Friendly alien weakens and nearly dies but timely arrival of ship restores him to health just before departure.   <br /> <br />That said, a good story is a good story--and this is a good story, even redone.   Carpenter's \\"take\\" on the story is very well done and hugely entertaining.  Highly recommended.
0140277447|5.0|People in Jap, distorted in mind don't accept the fact that has been confirmed millions of times. They still think they were making good for asia in Wordwar II. How could they, by killing, by raping, by destructuring, bombing? Jap is a crazy country, they could be another killer in the future. People throughout the world should be alerted! Accept the fact, Jap. otherwise you will see tens of nuclear bombs, one day.
0140277447|5.0|Look at the review by those Jap.s, you know why they derserve <br />the two bombs.
0618477977|5.0|This is a superb gift to give to your kids. My children never get enough of it. Highly recommended and appreciated by kids (and adults) everywhere who love the holiday season.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is as it seems an autobiographical album of the grammy-award winning singer. I've listened to several songs on here which she wrote and co-wrote and really I give her points for honesty. The best thing about her on this album is her voice really is perfect. Her album shows her vulnerability all her feelings. This really made me respect her more as an artist because really she is. Why she's compared to britney spears ill never know (Britney can't sing! she's too fake). This album is not like her previous one where it seemed all pop-like. NOPE! This album is a mixture of genres: a lil hip-hop, a lil pop and a lil rock (Fighter is the best song on here with the rock sound to it!). Really its an album that shows her maturity perhaps her explicit sexuality which many people seem to be bothered by it. She's made a mark with the release of this album. Give this cd a chance you'll find out she's so SUPER talented.
0784011680|5.0|I can't believe this guy doesn't have an oscar for this movie!! This movie is beyond the best he's ever done. I saw it today in the afternoon and it was just purely wonderful. The story was done beautifully. Downey Jr. at his best. Just a great actor who shows his versatility in this film. Really did amaze me in so many ways. Great film by far
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album Rox! BUT I reeeeeally don't get you people, I really don't. This album has been rated by some people with 4/5 stars, then they slate the songs! come on people be fair!! These guys rule, and this has to be their best yet! Im not saying you should think that, that's just my opinion, take it or leave it, but this cd is definatley worth your money. Green Day are more like '2 hit wonders' in the UK, as we only really remember 'Time of your life' and 'American Idiot', but these guys desserve so so so much more, as this album proves the punk ledgends have still got it (and for a hell of a lot longer too I hope). <br />But anyway, heres a song-by-song guide, and what I think of each one- <br />1.American Idiot- This song kicks a**! Most people are tired of it now, but in my ears, it's still wicked. 9/10 <br />2. I. Jesus Of Suburbia- This song is catchy, and a great intro to a great 5-part song 8/10 <br />II. City Of The Damned- I like this song, it's got some cool lyrics,I think it should've been a whole song on it's own lol. 7/10 <br />III. I Don't Care- I cool intro riff, yeah its repetitive, but these guys can get away with it. 8/10 <br />IV. Dearly Beloved - Not the best song on the album, a bit short, but still a cool song, shows a bit of a romantic side to the band. 6/10 <br />V.- Tales Of Another Broken Home- Not too keen on this song, but it fits into the 5-part-song thing cool, I don't like slating things too much, cos I couldn't do better myself, so ya no.5/10 <br />3. Holiday- This song is catchy, has cool lyrics, and a wickedly short chorus. 8/10 <br />4.Blvd. Of Broken Dreams- This song is my favourite on the album, I can't put my finger on what it is, but it has something. It starts to sound like a ballad, but with an edge of punk, the lyrics are awesome.Lovin' it 10/10 <br />5. Are We The Waiting- After listening to this cd so much, this one started to not like this song as much, I know Im contredicting myself, by saying this, but the repetition gets on my nerves, the only downside to the album. 4/10 <br />6.St.Jimmy- One of the best songs on the album, wicked lyrics & chorus, this song's fast, and catchy. 9/10 <br />7. Give Me Novacaine- A slower song, but still an amazing song 8/10  <br />8.Shes A Rebel- Another song thats fast, cool lyrics stick in your mind, the chorus is a bit repetitive,but still deserves 8/10 <br />9.Extrodinary Girl- Strange intro riff, and another slower song,still has cool lyrics though. 7/10 <br />10.Letterbomb- I love this song, the eerie intro is wicked, and the rest of the song rulz. 9/10 <br />11.Wake Me Up When September Ends- A slower, more of a ballad style song, but is amazing,awesome lyrics. 9/10 <br />12.HomeComing <br />I.The Death Of St.Jimmy- I sound gory, but the reason I like this song is the second verse 'Jimmy died today, he blew his brains out into the bay, in the state of mind, it's my own private suicide' wicked 9/10 <br />II. East 12th St.- Sounds like the sequel to Jesus of Suburbia (probably is) love it, catchy lil verses. 8/10 <br />III.Nobody Likes You- The only song on the album written by Mike Dirnt, and is cool, a bit too slow for my liking, though Im sure many others will like it. 6/10 <br />IV. Rock And Roll Girlfriend- The only song written by drummer, Tre Cool, but this song is cool, it's a short catchy song, the same words are repeated in almost each line 'I got a rock n roll...' wicked 7/10 <br />V.We're Coming Home Again- I started to like this song, but the towards the end, it started to get a bit too repetitive, the slow chorus annoyed me slightly. 6/10 <br />12.Whatsername- I love this song, yet again, I can't quite say why though. The song is slow in it's verses, but speeds up for the chorus, it's small little things that made me like it.9/10 <br />Well there you go, my opinion of Green Day 'American Idiot' an amazing album, one that takes pride in it's place in my cds. Hope I've been some use to you. XxXxX RoCk On XxXxX
B0002Z1EG2|1.0|I used to enjoy Shania Twain's music, when it was country music! Now it's way too poppy! She is a sellout! Don't buy this album!
B0002OERI0|5.0|In a world where more and more horrible bands like Default, Hoobastank, and Breaking Benjamin seem to appear every day, thank God that Green Day decided to step in and show 'em how it's done. This, my friends, is rock and roll. <br /> <br />While other bands like Velvet Revolver have made honest attempts to revive the dying rock scene, they have mostly failed due to the fact that they aren't really doing anything new. With American Idiot, Green Day has taken the basic idea of writing a concept album-- with inspiration from bands like The Who, The Clash, Husker Du, and even broadway-- and fused it with the pop sensibilities of The Beatles and their own crushing punk style. <br /> <br />The result is an excellent album, musically, lyrically and otherwise. While all but one of the songs on the album tells the story of a teenager named Jesus of Suburbia, they can easily stand on their own as great, listenable songs that are distinctly Green Day. A fan of Dookie or Nimrod should enjoy this album just as much as a fan of any of the bands I mentioned above, or just rock in general. <br /> <br />I always suspected that behind the irreverent pop-punk radio hits was a band that really knew their stuff, musically; this album proves it. Forget Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Simple Plan and all the other Green Day-wannabes-- this album puts them to shame. Very highly recommended.
0140277447|5.0|Iris Chang stands up to remind the whole world crimes commited by <br />these Japanese troops, a undeniable truth denied shamelessly  <br />again and again by Japanese themselves. This is a masterpiece and <br />a real serious explosure of the history.  <br />History will not be forgotten, so does Iris Chang and her masterpiece.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE Shania Twain have, but I am a little dissappointed in this so-called Greatest Hits Collection.  To me a greatest hit is a song in its entirity, not RADIO EDITS!!! I was so disappointed that some of my favorite Shania hits were not on the disc in their entirity, instead I got radio edits of my favorite songs (You Win My Love, If You're Not In It For Love, I'm Outta Here, I'm Gonna Getcha Good) I was really disappointed, how dare they insult us Shania fans by giving us half of some of her biggest hits.  Also the country version of \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" should have been used, not the pop version.  The album is worth the new songs \\"Party For Two\\" and \\"Don't\\". But this Shania fan is going to make his own Shania Twain Greatest Hits CD, with all of her hits in their entirity.
0451526015|3.0|If you were to ask anyone if they would like to look young for the rest of their life, you would mostly think that the anwser would be \\"yes\\".  When Dorian Gray gazed upon his portrait and mumbled that he wished that he would stay that same as he appears in his portrait, the last thing that Mr. Gray expected was that his wish was going to come true.  While time rolls on, Dorians friends start to suspect something of Mr. Gray, but do not really know how to ask him about it.  As Mr. Gray's friends grow older, some people find out that Mr. Gray has a secret in the attic of his home.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Over the years, Green Day has always had a distinct sound; it's what has made them interesting.  <br /> <br />\\"American Idiot\\" is a disapointment to long-time fans. Most of the stuff on this album could be on an Avril Lavigne record. Cliche, pop-esqued, and mediocre, the band's new album is nothing special. <br /> <br />Coming from a long-time Green Day fan, save your money. The only people that will buy this album are all the Good Charlotte fans.
0385510438|5.0|This novel is not at all what I expected.  It focused on people's lives, relationships, and small town habits instead of a courtroom deliberation.  It was refreshing.  It touched on some very delicate issues such as desegregation of schools and corruption of politicians while at the same time being entertaining and predominantly light.  In addition this is one of the few Grisham books with a solid ending.  By basing the story on the newspapers existence it gives the book a more structured timeline.  I feel this is one of Grisham's best books.  For those of you who are avid Grisham fans you should try and see how many names and personalities you recognize from some of his other books.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|what the heck, this cd is total garbage the music is boring with very very stupid lyrics, this band is a discrace to classic rock style music.  Don't get me wrong I love classic rock but this is just retarded, posers trying to make aname for themselves.  What is up with the lyrics, Are You Gunna Be My Girl has some of the dumbest lyrics ever, and don't even get me started on Cold Hard B**** I read a interview in Guitar World with Jet and they said themselves that the chorus had nothing to do with the verses and visa versa.  what is that about?  In the same interview they dissed on Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Yngwie Malmsteen, if you don'tknow who those guys are then checkthm out, they are 3 of the most talanted guitarists in the world.  P.S. I only gave this cd 1 star because it is the lowest rating there is.
B0002858YS|3.0|i was expecting a lot more from this album, as the two singles were absolutely amazing.  \\"jenny\\" and \\"smile like you mean it\\" are very good tracks, but all the good music on this cd is in the front end.  the quality falls off after \\"somebody told me,\\" fading into an oblivion of \\"me-too\\" rock with an artsy '80s feel.  its not a bad album, much better than a lot of stuff ive heard, but i was certainly looking for more.

B00000G3PA|2.0|Jerry Bruckheimer has proved to us that with filmmaking like this, Armageddon really is here.  We're doomed.  <br />To enjoy this film you need to check your brain at the door and just really assume that anything is possible.   It also helps if you're a very emotional person that can get lost in feelings quite easily.   Unless you're wrapped up with the whole end of the world thing and not thinking rationally, you're going to find many holes in the plot, actors (some of them good) struggling with bad material and special effects done to the point where it just makes you sick.   What I really enjoyed about this film was how clever Jerry Bruckheimer was to keep the &quot;action&quot; and &quot;plot&quot; (terms used very loosely) so fast paced and hard to follow that you didn't even notice that he totally avoided even trying to realistically simulate the conditions of space (or anything else for that matter).<br />A worthy film for masochists.
B0002KVUKW|2.0|Yea I wanted to see this movie my friend saw it he said it was awesome, my brother in law saw he said it was boring.And when I saw it I agree, theres no plot to it, and its boring and dumb the only scene I like its the action scene in the beginnig but its still dumb.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Plain and simple, title explains it.  I just don't like them.

1400032717|4.0|This innovative and clever yet tender novel of Christopher Boone, an highly-functioning 15 year-old with autism, is unique and to be appreciated.  Narrated in the first person, the author, Mark Haddon, who has previously worked with people with autism, convincingly immerses us into what is the supposed mind set of an individual with autism.  As Christopher discovers truths about himself and his family while trying to solve the mystery of who murdered the neighbor's dog, he is able to overcome some of the social obstacles encountered by autistic individuals.
0140277447|5.0|It seems in some 1 star reviews, they attributed this book to the influence of China government's \\"propaganda\\", overlooking the fact that Iris Chang grew up in this free country.

B0002Z1EG2|2.0|not alot of Substance to her. I give her Dap for working a style&sound that bridges Country,Pop&Adult Radio. she is smart for working those elements&having a catchy hook or Groove here&there. Vocally she has hd some decent moments,but on a whole take away the Production&cleaver titles&there ain't alot happening. Shania is a Foxy Lady,but Musically She is run of the mill. after Her first Album&a few cuts I just ain't felt her quite the same.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I felt Iron Maiden's big \\"reunion\\" recording \\"Brave New World\\" was merely okay, so I didn't have very high expectations for future material. How wrong I was, as \\"Dance of Death\\" is one of Maiden's strongest albums as a whole.<br /><br />Iron Maiden have many great songs spanning their long career; some of my favorites are \\"Prowler,\\" \\"Remember Tomorrow,\\" \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" \\"Genghis Khan,\\" \\"Children of the Damned,\\" Hallowed be thy Name,\\" \\"Flight of Icarus,\\" \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\" etc. Despite this commendable fact, most of their recordings were plagued by \\"filler\\" or less than memorable tunes (e.g. \\"Gangland,\\" \\"Quest for Fire,\\" \\"Flash of the Blade,\\" etc.). Not to mention at least one of their recordings was unbelievably bad -- \\"Virtual XI\\" (with \\"Fear of the Dark\\" close on its heels). There were really only three recordings that were excellent AS A WHOLE -- the self-titled debut, \\"Killers\\" and \\"The X-Factor.\\" (I know some would disagree about \\"X-Factor,\\" mainly Dickinson fans who can't envision Maiden without Bruce singing, but it is a very strong recording -- a Maiden masterpiece, in fact. Be open-minded and give it a second chance).<br /><br />Well, I'm pleased to say that with \\"Dance of Death\\" Maiden have finally put out another recording that is strong from start to finish. Some highlights include:<br /><br />WILDEST DREAMS. A fine, light, quick opener; sort of a modern-day \\"Running Free.\\"<br /><br />RAINMAKER is similar to the opener in spirit but is even catchier. This is the big 'hit' of the recording, sorta like \\"Wrathchild\\" or \\"The Flight of Icarus.\\" The subject matter is mature, positive, spiritual and very welcomed by this reviewer. Another Amazon reviewer ridiculously complained that it was like Maiden doing \\"Christian rock;\\" I guess he'd rather have them record juvenile tunes about how much life stinks and how we should all be losers and commit suicide (Waaa, waaa).<br /><br />NO MORE LIES is another highlight with a nice build-up. It's also the third longest song on the CD.<br /><br />DANCE OF DEATH is a Maiden masterpiece along the lines of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"Hallowed be thy Name.\\" (Okay, maybe not THAT good, but close, real close).<br /><br />NEW FRONTIER is just as catchy as the first two tunes; interestingly, it's McBrain's first song written for Maiden -- great job, mate!<br /><br />PASCHENDALE is a patented Harris epic of magnificent proportions. The song features some seriously heavy, original & fast riffing and is ingeniously structured. The CD is worth buying for this masterpiece alone.<br /><br />FACE IN THE SAND is musically memorable and great; unfortunately Bruce overdoes it and strains to stay in key (e.g. \\"Quest for Fire\\"), almost ruining the song (I said 'almost'). This is definitely a case where Dianno or Blaze would have done a better job.<br /><br />The other songs are good as well, including the refreshing acoustic piece \\"Journeyman.\\"<br /><br />CONCLUSION: \\"Dance of Death\\" is proof that Maiden aren't floggin' a dead horse -- they still got it in 'em to create great music and great albums.

B0006284JQ|2.0|I'll give Britney  Spears  dap for a 2-3 cuts that I have liked by Her. but let me tell you it ain't because of Her Voice it has all to do with the Production of the cut.She is the Modern Day Era of what a Studio can generate&what a Label can put out here. I ain't madd at her at all.I respect Her Hustle,but lets be real there ain't much there in terms of Music vibe.every era has a Britney type of Artist that catches on&oh well they have a few decent cuts but that doesn't make a Greatest hits.
B000089CJI|5.0|I'm not a fan of techno music but when I first listened to \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\", I got shivers all over my body. I knew at that moment that the Postal Service was an extraordinary band.  There is no filler at all in this album, and the lyrics are well written.  Pay close attention to the lyrics in \\"Such Great Heights\\". They almost remind me of Leondard Cohen. <br /> <br />Absolutley Beautiful!
B00005QDW5|2.0|I'm sorry to undermine everyone else's thoughtful comments about this cd, but DO NOT BUY IT. I will give you one reason: This compilation titled \\"Echoes\\" does not even have the real version of the song \\"Echoes\\". Surprising? Not especially, if you have to mass-produce and commercialize a brilliant band, the best way is to cram as much material into one abbreviated crapfest, right? Yea, sure, its got all the singles. If you want the REAL genius of Pink Floyd, buy Meddle, the cd which has the REAL Echoes song on it. Buy Dark Side of the Moon, buy Animals, buy their entire discography because thats the only way to truly get a feel for the Floyd. This cd is terribly arranged, it throws in songs from The Wall and Momentary Lapse right next to Sid Barrets little acid poems, with a complete lack of chronology or concern for styling. Maybe some people enjoy the roller-coaster effect, but it doesnt feel natural to me. Repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS CD. Look over the rest of the Pink Floyd collection and take your pick, ANY AND ALL CDS ARE BETTER THAN THIS ONE!!!!!!
B00008J4P5|1.0|Music is subjective I'll admit, but what are you people hearing here I'm not? My God this cd sounds like my nephews frikin garage band on a bad day. Is that the point here?, is it supposed to sound like a first take in a low budget studio? Maybe I'm just a tainted musician, but I can't figure this bands popularity out. The tunes are ok at best and even that's pushing it. These people can hardly play their instruments and the singings God Awful most of the time. Call me jaded or whatever, but this band does absolutely nothing for me and that was after listen number six while trying to keep an open mind. Sorry folks not my cup of tea.<br /><br />A big No thanks!!
0140277447|5.0|This is undeniable truth, this book should be a history text book for ALL japanese! Let all japanese know what terrible thing their troops did in china!
B000002H6C|4.0|This cd can be expressed in two words really. The good two words!! Great songs, good ideas, powerful delivery. The bad two words!! Hollow sounding, poor production, cardboady sounding.<br /><br />I like cd's to have a wide dynamic sound to them. Highs, mids, lows etc. This has only mids and that is my biggest grip with this cd. The songs are great, but production is crap!!<br /><br />Overall it's a keeper but it needs to be remastered of something to fix that dull sound.
B0000029GA|5.0|now to that other review about tupac being better than nas, Tupac was good but not great to what a lot of people think he is, and I think thats cause of the brainwashing Mtv does and a lot of new rappers oout there. LISTEN TO DE LA SOUL OR TRIBE CALLED QUEST OR SOME ERIC B AND RAKIM or some boogie down productions
B00005B1EX|5.0|Rob live and in full metal fever. This cd rocks from start to finish. Tunes are tight and frikin great. Into the Pit totally kicks ass!!. The sound is excellent and the tune selection is great. Man am I glad he is back!!<br /><br />Halford Rulz!!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Funky Herbie Hancock music, title's that can only be Swinging London and the dirty green grass of an English park (whose significance will only emerge later). We see a troupe of mimes who race around for no apparent reason causing some confusion and embarrassment. We see the David Hemmings character of the Photographer coming out of a dosshouse and jumping into his Rolls Royce.  The old and the new London are shown in a series of beautiful and simple establishing shots.  We are increasingly aware of a use of bold colour contrasts by Antonioni - a blue van and a  yellow van, an entire street of red houses and a blue house, two black nuns in white habits and a guardsman who seems to be guarding a public street - juxtapositions galore. <br /> <br />The opening minutes of Antonioni's movie are stylishly cold but sexy, perhaps a little dated  to contemporary eyes and extremely ambiguous. <br />Ingmar Bergman said a few years ago that Antonioni had made at least two masterpieces; that is \\"La Notte\\" and \\"Blow Up\\".  It's quite useful to look at Bergmans \\"Persona\\" and contrast it's extremely ambitious intentions with the equally challenging \\"Blow Up\\", which was released in the same year.  Antonioni doesn't immediately appear to go as far as Bergman in deconstructing the established form of the movie but in a slightly less self-conscious way he seems to be pushing the medium into new areas of expression.  <br /> <br />An incredible sequence shot in a London park follows.  A growing sense of unease and dislocation with the world is being created.  The wind is picking-up, leaves are rustling.  He is taking pictures of Vanessa Redgrave and an older man in some kind of clandestine encounter.  Redgrave try's to get the camera, she bite's his hand - \\"What's the rush!\\" is the Photographers response.  We sense the dialogue is moving into a more expressionistic area also, it's going in the direction of a kind of minimalist-surrealism.  The Redgrave character goes back to the Studio with Hemmings. They share a joint and some wine and she moves  awkwardly to the  music; almost embarrassingly so.  Hemmings starts to process the film and in a series of shots, we hear the rustle of leaves once again, he starts to construct a sequence of events from the seemingly innocent rolls of negatives.  The inversion of the increasingly detailed  photos yielding a more difficult to interpret image is a satisfying puzzle. The photographer is being challenged with a startlingly different reality from the one he expected to see. <br /> <br />The commentary by Peter Brunette is a slight disappointment. <br />He seems to make several inexplicable omissions, although the majority of his insights are useful.  For instance, he mentions that Antonioni probably had a house painted blue; just after the Photographer has just driven down an amazing street of all red houses.  He also doesn't mention the introduction of the sound of the ball being struck by the racquets at the films remarkable finale.  I find some of the best commentaries on DVD are a constant stream of interesting background information; Mr Peter Cowie being probably it`s greatest exponent. Mr Brunette seems to leave silence where I'd have really preferred comment.  <br /> <br />The trailer and teaser trailer are great pieces of 60's kitsch and if you think the movie seems dated these will seem positively prehistoric. <br />The quality of the transfer is absolutely spot-on with only a couple of imperfections (a rather irritating vertical line over Redgrave for a minute and the odd rogue hair on the screen) and perhaps the colour seems slightly less saturated than it should be.  These are very minor quibbles though, and anyone interested in the potential of films should really own this movie. <br />
B000002WPI|5.0|If you haven't heard this rap masterpiece, it's not too late.  Buy it.  Why?  Just do it.<br /><br />9 MCs, count 'em, 9, from Staten Island, New York, made the legendary Wu-Tang Clan what it was.  The GZA, Raekwon, Inspector Deck, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, ODB, Masta Killa, U-God, and RZA with the beats AND the rhymes - it doesn't get much better.<br /><br />Absolutely everything on here is on-point, from track one, where the Clan doesn't forget to \\"Bring Da Ruckus\\" over a classic RZA beat, all the way to the track twelve conclusion.  Packed with 9 of NY's illest MCs, there's not one member of the Clan who can't consistently deliver on this joint.  From the GZA and his metaphors, to ODB and his strange rough noises and humourous takes on violence, everyone on here can bring it.  Even the Clan's producer, the RZA, delivers capable rhymes, not to mention his entertaining choice of Kung-Fu samples, off-key piano loops and blaring horn-packed beats.<br /><br />The standout tracks on here include - well, all of them.  ODB delivers two amazing verses on \\"Shame on a N****\\", backed by Method Man and Raekwon the Chef, the GZA tears it up on the highly-underrated track \\"Clan in da Front\\", only outdone by one of the RZA's best beats to date.  \\"Can It Be All So Simple\\" has the duo of Raekwon and Ghostface rhyming over thumping bass chords, and \\"C.R.E.A.M\\" has Raekwon and Inspector Deck tearing it up over a haunting piano melody and Meth on the hook.  Speaking of Method Man, he absolutely kills it on his self-titled track.<br /><br />Like I said, everything on here is excellent, which is reason enough for you to get this album, and see what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about - classic RZA production, classic Wu-Tang Clan rhymes.  This is what rap is all about.<br /><br />RIP ODB - May his soul rest in peace.  The Clan will never be the same.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is a magical album. Mr. Williams reflects a pretty atmosphere to this story of magic and sorcery. The music is very delightful and pleasant. Some of the tracks are: PROLOGUE opens the album with a mysterious sound; HARRY'S WONDROUS WORLD the close theme, one of the most popular themes, a masterpiece of magic; THE ARRIVAL OF BABY HARRY, the open theme introduces our mind to this magic world, a really good track and one of my favorites; DIAGON ALLEY AND GRINGOTTS VAULT, a colorful melody with a magnificent finale; MR. LONGBOTTOM FLIES, one of my favorites tracks, a masterpiece that combines a wide number of variations, as the track 2, this is a very popular track; THE QUIDDITCH MATCH, a long track that transports the people to a really match of this game, very popular and masterpiece; FLUFFY'S HARP, one of the most harmonic and melodic tracks of the album, this is very relaxing, one of my favorites; LEAVING HOGWARTS, a really beautiful song, very melodic; HEDWIG'S THEME, the best track of the album, the masterpiece of Harry, the most artistic and beautiful track, combines Harry's wondrous world, Arrival of baby Harry, and Prologue. This track is the really theme of the movie. <br />In conclusion, the album is a magical box. It is a really good album. The fans and no fans of Harry will love this CD. I love it.  <br />
0140277447|5.0|A few years ago, on the 4th of July, a friend of mine from high school commited suicide.  He hung himself while riding a train en route to New York.  I wasn't called or invited to the funeral.   <br /> <br />A couple of years later I saw his mother at a wedding.  She was obviously still deep in the process of grief.  She had a vacancy in her eyes that matched the one in my soul.  Somehow I allowed her to corner me and to ask me the question: why?  I gave the only answer I could have; a meaningless and sympathic answer that must have been as false as it sounded. <br /> <br />Today on NPR I hear, \\"Iris Chang, the bestselling non-fiction author of the 'Rape of Nanking,' was discovered dead in a car on the side of a California highway, an apparent suicide.\\"  She shot herself. <br /> <br />Her friend, Ignatius Ding, says of her:  \\"She saw all of the dark side of human history.  She was so sad and frustrated to see, day in and day out, what people could do to their fellow human beings.  Those images hung over her all the time.   Her room was like a shrine.  This is where she had lived for the last ten years ever since I have known her.  She cried a lot and was so depressed about the unfortunate past.  Her study was just full of maps, pictures, photos.  She posted all of it on the wall to keep track of the things she was writing.   This is where she lived and it was like a shadow over her life all the time.\\" <br /> <br />This is something like what I said to my friend's mother.  I imagine that, as this explanation of a courageous woman's death, my words were just as false.  And yet, despite the accidents of biology and chemistry that constrain us all, is there any doubt that this woman, who wrote so eloquently of the most lamentable aspect of our race, must have had a heart as big as any that ever felt love and compasion for her species? <br /> <br />In a 1998 speech, she compared the Rape of Nanking to more recent brutality in places like Bosnia, Rwanda, Indonesia.  It was important in all of those cases, she said, to tell the truth, to refute the deniers: \\"In fact, denial and amnesia are considered part of the final stages of genocide.   First the victims are killed and then the memory itself is killed.\\"  Iris Chang produced two or three of the most important historical essays of the last 50 years, as will become obvious in this, the Chinese Century.  But her works were not important just because they shed light on the mystery that is the Chinese, a quarter of the global population.  As in \\"The Rape of Nanking,\\" Chang speaks of the depths of human evil that can be inspired by blind patriotism.  Her works compliment and are comparable in scholarship to contemporaries like John Dower.  Those of us who loved her books will feel bereft now that she is gone, as if we have lost an old friend. <br /> <br />Iris Chang was 36 in November, 2004.  She is survived by her husband and their son, who was two years old when she died.  We mourn her exit.
B00004W592|5.0|This is a great CD to just zone into. If you like great rock musicians just being as such, check this out. The drumming is phenomenal. I used to love this album and have happily re-introduced myself after 25 years. You can't beat the old bands.
0884271153|5.0|\\"The Goal\\" was written to introduce Goldratt's Theory of Constratins (TOC) to production problems, but it also suggested applications to sales and marketing.  \\"It's Not Luck\\" takes us beyound \\"The Goal\\" and applies TOC to sales and marketing problems directly, with implications for corporate strategy. <br /> <br />No new theories are proposed, but Goldratt does not need to.  Instead, one follows Alex Rogo as he becomes a true beleiver in TOC.  He learns how to apply TOC to distribution channels, expensive high-ticket technology sales, and even commodity, price-driven situations.  He also begins to understand how to use TOC to build a wider corporate strategy. <br /> <br />Nothing new is needed beyound what has already been introduced in \\"The Goal\\"  The application of TOC to sales & marketing provides a more vivid picture of the power of TOC.  If you liked \\"The Goal\\" then you will like \\"It's Not Luck\\".  I did.
B00005JMJG|5.0|<br />\\"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! <br />The world forgetting, by the world forgot <br />Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! <br />Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\\" <br /> <br />--\\"Eloisa to Abelard\\" by Alexander Pope, a quotation read by Mary to Dr. Mierzwiak during the film <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is one of the most intensely beautiful and heartbreakingly honest films that I have ever seen.  I am truly at a lost for words; I am awed by the utter brilliance of screenwriter Charlie Kauffman.  This man is a genius.  He understands love and expresses it in such a stunning and truthful way that I never thought possible onscreen.  Never before have I seen such an innovative, quirky, and truly touching film.  Not the kind of touching that leaves you bawling for hours afterwards in the \\"Titanic\\" tradition, but the kind that really sticks with you; the kind that hits a nerve and will have you thinking about it for months afterwards. <br /> <br />With \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", both Jim Carrey and Charlie Kauffman prove something to us.  Carrey establishes himself without a doubt as a talented, versatile actor.  For awhile, I never though he'd move beyond slapstick comedies (think \\"Ace Ventura), which he's good at, don't get me wrong, but this man has such an interesting soul and such profound emotional depth that never really had a chance to shine through until now (we caught a glimpse of it in the enjoyable \\"The Majestic\\").  I hope that now that Carrey has proved himself more dramatic roles will be offered to him.  He is capable of much more than we originally believed! <br /> <br /> <br />Two of my favorite quotations (my favorite is above).  Simple and beautiful, especially if you've seen the film and can put them in context. <br /> <br />Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon.  <br />Joel: I know.  <br />Clementine: What do we do?  <br />Joel: Enjoy it. <br /> <br />Joel:I don't see anything I don't like about you.  <br />Clementine: But you will! But you will, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped, because that's what happens with me.  <br />Joel: Okay.  <br />[last lines]  <br />Clementine: Okay.  <br />Joel: Okay. <br />
B00005JKCH|5.0|Alfred Molina is fantastic as Doc Oc and the storyline follows the comic pretty well for a movie version of a comic.  The special effects are as expected, wonderful. <br /> <br />I have cancelled my order for the movie though as \\"Marvel\\" have taken out a lawsuit against \\"City of Heroes\\" and I will not be buying any \\"Marvel\\" products due to this.  I have been a Marvel fan since I learnt to read from \\"The Fantastic Four\\" comics as a kid, so it is a hard choice for me. Many comics fan friends of mine are doing the same too, even those who don't play \\"City of Heroes\\" as it could change many aspects of games and films etc...if the lawsuit goes ahead. A lot of game players are boycotting Marvel too. <br /> <br />Anyway buy the film if you like Spiderman, you will not be disappointed.
B0002B15PG|4.0|Those who just want a run of the mill \\"pirate\\" flick may rate this movie as fair. This movie is a story within a story yet within a story. This movie reveals the social requirements for captain / officer while it brings to view the life style of all rank aboard a war vessel. Knowing the multi-century turmoil between the two european nations adds to this movie's plot. For seafaring history lovers, this film is a 10.
B000002MP2|5.0|Rarely do I have a CD for 10 years and still just absolutely love it.  When I Come Around is my top favorite.  However, I'll always remember back in 7th or 8th grade when Longview came out, and it was such a different sound to anything that was out there at that time. I love them!  Basketcase is a good song as well as some others.  A lot of these songs are fun for a workout CD too!

6305657947|5.0|In this 1999 remake, Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is revamped as a highly successful businessman who takes great personal risk to get his kicks: art theft.   The initial theft scene is high-tech and beautifully executed: Romanian men saw their way out of the belly of a Trojan Horse delivered to the museum. As they nearly pull off a succesful heist, Thomas Crown trips one of the suspects. In all the excitement, a Monet goes missing from the Impressionist wing--into Crown's briefcase.  <br /> <br />Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) enters the picture to assist the police in investigating the theft. Banning is a \\"bounty hunter\\" of sorts for the insurance agency: she tries to recover the missing art for a percentage of what would be a hundred million dollar payout from the insurance agency. She frustrates the police when she uses her own resources and sexuality to find the painting in possession of Thomas Crown. The lead detective, Michael McCann (Denis Leary), is enthralled with her, but seems to realize that this wealthy American turned European semi-socialite is out of his league. He helps Banning back on her feet when she feels betrayed by Crown's increasingly secretive actions as they--two self-centered high acheivers--fall for each other and make tentative plans to run away.  <br /> <br />Attention to detail makes this film more than an urbane action flick.  The lead actors turn in impressive performances, especially Russo. And, Faye Dunaway makes an appearance worthy of more screen time as Crown's therapist.  Additionally, the film uses the excitement of the theft and subsequent investigation to build on Banning's and Crown's chemistry.  Plus, the soundtrack is unique, but still contributes rather than takes away from the mood and action.  (Unless you watch it several times and start to think, \\"Hey, I really like this soundtrack!\\").  The cinematography has a similar effect, whether its the wider angle shots of Crown and Banning on a glider flight or Carribean vacation, or the tighter, shifting scenes of Crown making mergers and acquisitions, both legal and illegal.  Plus, it's nice to have an action film that not only has a story, but doesn't have cheesy special effects that become dated so quickly (think Mission Impossible--now dated vs. the Fugitive (Harrison Ford)--good stunt acting never looks fake). <br /> <br />This is a DVD that I've really been glad that I purchased, rather than rented.  It makes a great date DVD--men like the action and Russo, women like the romance and Brosnan.  The beautiful locations, the actors, the soundtrack, and the shooting make this one of those movies that you'll enjoy watching over the years.

B00003CXAT|5.0|A first-class adaptation of the book, Jurassic Park is up there with the original versions of The Lost World and King Kong as the pinnacle of monster movies.  The characters are all well-acted, the storylines are engaging, and the effects will stick in your mind for a long time to come.  You really do feel as though you're in the car trying not to be seen or heard by that horrifyingly convincing T-Rex.  The Raptors are Spielberg's finest movie creation since Jaws, and the sets, combined with a first-rate soundtrack, really makes you feel as though you're on some faraway island.
0553573403|4.0|I was reading the list of reviews I've done before and realized that I'm usually only motivated to write reviews on books I disliked.  I do so to try to save other readers the disappointment of devoting hours to an unworthy novel, but it occurs to me that I'm not doing justice to the truly worthy ones that way.<br /><br />That in mind, I enjoyed this book a great deal.  In fact, the entire series has been consistant and entertaining, and I'm becoming quite impatient waiting for the excellently titled \\"A Feast for Crows\\" installment.<br /><br />Avid fantasy readers will find very little here they haven't read before in some way or other, but what you might find is an author with a skill for immersing the reader in the story, and a well fleshed plot that doesn't drag or jump around incoherently.
B00004WIDR|3.0|This sequal to Jurassic Park, based on another of Michael Crichton's books, is fun and engaging, but unfortunately is nowhere near as good as its predecessor.  There are a lot of dinosaurs, but story seems to take second place to special effects.  Interesting details include a comic parody of Bob Bakker, but all too often it feels like it's being played for laughs.  Recommended to fans of the series, but the original and part 3 are much better.
0140277447|5.0|When I read Iris Zhang's book \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", I was not as shocked as other people because my grandmother had told me such things from her experience. My grandmother lived in a small village near Zheng Zhou, He Nan Province. When Jap army invaded into their hometown, most people ran away into mountains. However some villagers stayed at home to take care their ill relatives and property. After a couple of months, the Jap army moved and my grandmother came back to their village. She found their village was set fire and totally destroyed. All villagers who didn't leave were killed! And a boy was even cut off between his legs!! So brutal,atrocious, slaughterous was the Japenese!!!Japenese own Chinese people millions of lives. They committed crime more hedeous than Nazi. Shame on Japanese! <br />If they still don't realize their crime, they will be punished back one day!
B00003CXXS|5.0|Bringing the energy back to the series, this sequal also features the return of Sam Neill as a more embittered Dr Grant.  The new storyline involves the rescuing of a crashed aircraft from Jurassic Park's 'Site B'.  The characters are all strong and well-acted, there is barely a dull moment, and the dinosaurs are at their best.  Worth noting is the giant Spinosaurus (watch out for the 'Jaws' tribute), which battles the T-Rex.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Let me set the record straight: I have not been a follower of Ray Charles' music. But I found this album to be interesting, partly because of the artists he teamed up with, after having read about it on Paste Magazine. It has a real high production and historical value, considering the amount of talent that was put together to make it happen.<br /><br />Though not all of the songs touch me in the same way, some of these versions I can totally see becoming new standards, with my favorites being the Sinatra classic \\"It was a very good year\\" alongside Willie Nelson, \\"Hey Girl\\" with Michael McDonald and the BB King track. However, I cannot help but think about the formula being used: tribute/duets, posthumous album... those concepts smell like music label greed to me, but still the net feeling I get after listening to it is: it's a keeper!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Definitely a good CD with a powerful message about what America has become but I think they could do without the cursing.  There are also a few weak spots. <br /> <br />What I thought was strange that tracks number 2 and 12 include several short songs under one track listing.  At first this is kind of cool but later on it gets somewhat annoying when you have to listen through all eight minutes of track 2 at once to get to your favorite song on it.  Track number 2 includes 'Jesus of Suburbia' 'City of the Damned' 'I don't care' 'Dearly Beloved' and 'Tale of another broken home.' <br /> <br />Track number 12 includes 'The Death of St. Jimmy' 'East 12th Street' 'Nobody likes you' 'We're coming home again' and 'Rock and Roll Girlfriend.' <br /> <br />There were quite a few highlights on this album including \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" \\"Give me Novacaine\\" (which is a completely random song but for some reason, I like it) \\"Wake me up when September Ends\\" and \\"Whatsername.\\"  Most of the other songs are medocre but not very memorable or all that good. <br /> <br />One of my least favorite songs was actually \\"American Idiot.\\"  The lyrics were definitely making a statement but the melody is just an incredibly simple guitar part that gets pretty annoying after awhile. <br /> <br />Overall, I do recommend this CD but be aware of the weaknesses.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|The indie scene has become a bit crowded this year... or maybe it's always been so and we've only just become more aware of it lately. Among Interpol, Modest Mouse, The Postal Service, Death Cab for Cutie, Grandaddy and other acts in this realm, Franz Ferdinand flashes some interesting signs of musical creativity all the way from across the Atlantic, in Scotland. With a sound that reminds of Interpol at times, their self-titled album is able to keep you interested all the way through it, and all the way through many listenings... plus it has that sticky factor that most other indie acts seem to be missing. With a largely guitar-based sound, this Scottish band is one to keep an eye on, as long as they don't get hooked on a formula. And in the meantime, they are a sure way to take you \\"out\\" of your routine musical habits.

B000000W6F|4.0|This album was relly important to me and so many other people who spent the early 90's in suburban highschools. This was one of the seminal crossover albums that brought the previously \\"fringe\\" Alt. Rock style to the mainstream. When I think of the stuff I listened to back then with staying power, this album immediately comes to mind along with sophmore release Siamese Dream and other Butch Vig productions such as Sonic Youth's Goo and Dirty, and the ubiquitous Nirvana Nevermind Album. When someone makes a movie about highschool in the 90's they would be negligent not to include at least one of these songs in the soundtrack.  <br />Butch Vig is to Alt Rock in the 90's what Rick Rubin was to Hip Hop in the 80's. This album is at once accessible and challenging, and will always hold a prominent place in my nostalgia vault along with Jane's Addiction's bipolar Ritual De Lo Habitual album. If you enjoyed this you might also enjoy Dinosaur Jr and a lesser known UK band called Swervedriver. Also on the early 90's highschool tip - don't sleep on Ween or Hieroglyphics
158799190X|5.0|I often wonder how depressing the situation in science, be it 'hard' or 'soft', must be when a scientists such as myself must turn to the world of finance for insight into the business, the practice and the philosophical foundations of science.  I too often find myself learning the most important lessons concerning the (best) practice in science from texts on subjects as diverse as bonehead composition, investment and speculation, and (Good Lord!) history.  Taleb's book, Fooled by Randomness, is one of several texts that have taught me professional and life lessons, all the while mesmerizing me with such lovely bits of prose sprinkled here and there.  It is without a doubt financial and scientific poetry for the mind and the soul. <br /> <br />Although at times some passages require a re-read or two, the book is a small, brief meditation on probability and how it often plays out in (mostly) the financial markets and in life.  I placed 'mostly' in parenthesis because the book also spends a fair amount of time taking a few well-deserved swipes at scientists, be they 'hard' or quantitative types, or so-called 'soft' or holistic types.  Yet, with this book, Taleb had something more devious in mind, and with a sophisticated level of wit and subversion he has written a book largely on a vexing and dangerous subject- the ongoing confusion between luck and skill. <br /> <br />Many scientists have fallen into the trap of being able to compute, but not understand, probabilities, a distressing state of affairs that has unfortunately been actively abetted by most educational systems (especially at the graduate level).  Understanding of probability takes more than just 'a way with numbers'.  It also requires critical thinking.  Our ideas about probability are partly empirical; that is to say, our ideas are based either on past data or data taken from observation and/or experiment, careful or not. <br /> <br />Probability tries to determine likely outcomes and how often they willcome to pass.  In the financial world, it is quite common to use the past in order to divine (predict) the future.  This is often where many financial 'experts' go wrong, as they often confuse the usage of descriptive statistics (numerical summaries of the past) with inferential statistics (basically, using a sample to draw conclusions about a population, or more bluntly, making conclusions about the whole thing by looking at only a part of it).  Moreover, most financial experts and more than a few scientists often forget that their statistics are derived in a particular context, and in many cases that context is often changing, and thus, for all practical purposes, their predictive abilities using their fancy statistics is pretty much zero. <br /> <br />As such, this is the central theme of Taleb's book.  Statistical computation and the derivation and manipulation of equations do not in themselves imply understanding.  As Taleb says, \\"Most disasters come from the fact that individual scientists do not have an innate understanding of standard error or a clue about critical thinking.\\"  I find this to be too true of many of my colleagues, and more than a few big names in science.  This lack of understanding, when combined with an often intentional confusion of endless examples of notable anecdotes (all those people we seem to hear about who have made a killing in the market) and the average outcome (that great mass of humanity that either lost a tidy sum or, if Lady Luck did smile upon them, broke even), the egregious confusion between luck and skill, constantly changing contexts, and the pernicious habit (especially among scientists) to cling loyally to certain fundamentally flawed if not extremely limited ideas and worldviews tenaciously, serves to explain much of the foolishness that passes for 'science' in financial circles, or worse- 'conventional wisdom'- in the physical, biological and sociological sciences. <br /> <br />Those looking for a deeper understanding of probability and specifically, those wanting to comprehend how 'scientists' can and often do go horribly wrong in their thinking, definitely must read this book.  Just because an event has never occurred before doesn't mean it can not occur (as the fellows running Long Term Capital Management should have known), and all possible events can not be realistically accounted for at any given time.  Also, anyone looking to invest in the financial markets must read this book before they make any moves. <br /> <br />I am definitely keeping this book as a reference, and more to the point as a reminder that it is indeed possible for PhD holders to write with clarity, style, grace and wit- characteristics one seldom encounters in the writings of many so-called 'learned' individuals.
B000148KK2|3.0|I have all of Diana's CD's as well as the DVD of her magnificent Paris concert, and I adore them all, except for the first one, Stepping Out. She has matured so much as a performer since then. I was disappointed in The Girl in the Other Room; although the performance was sterling. The songs were all of a type, dark and enigmatic. A friend surmises that her loss of a parent and her marriage must have affected the content of this CD. I know nothing of Elvis Costello's music except for what is on this latest CD. Maybe I should check him out?
0140277447|5.0|Reply to the so called \\"general\\" Japanese,    My grandfather was killed by brutal Japs. And many other   people in our village where I lived were killed by these   monsters in late 1944.    The so called \\"general\\" Japanese, sent their sons  to kill Chinese people, sent their daughters to satisfy  those soldiers. They saved every penny to support the  war. Is it enough to call them guilty?    Without reparation and deep apology, there is no so  called peace, because history will repeat if you  don't learn from history.    Jap's PM visits war shrine every year to angry all Asian  countries which suffered from Japan.    All Chinese, Koreans, and other people, watch what Japan  is doing and what it is saying to determine if we should  or should not forgive them.    Without retrospection, Japs are doomed. Period.      \\"Especially to Chinese people,    As a Japanese, I am in a deep shock after reading so many extremely offensive comments against \\"general\\" Japanese.    Have these people who hate Japanese witnessed the holocaust by themselves? Do they at least have a connection to the victims? Do they hate any Japanese people in front of them even if they have nothing to do with the war?    Do they know that this unfounded hatred against a specific race is nothing but racism and nothing different from what the Japanese soldiers used for an excuse to kill Chinese people in those days?    I would not argue the credability of the content of this book nor agree with the Japanese government's attitude to the history problems.    The only thing I can say is that we have to stop the cycle of hatred. The hatred does not make us move forward. All these offensive comments reminded me of my terrible memories with some of my Chinese friends, at least thost who I believed are my friends.\\"

B0000039LE|5.0|The horror genre has had it's great moments. Such moments would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Child's Play, Friday the Thirteenth, etc. But the greatest ever is without a doubt, Halloween. None of those other slasher stars started killing at age six. Not only that, but damn that mask is scary! The movie starts out with young Michal Myers, stalking his sister and then killing her brutally. He is sent to a mental institution, where he escapes. Then he comes back to his hometown, where he goes to kill his last remaining family, Laurie Srode, who is played exellently by Jamie Lee Curtis. There is only one man who can stop him, Dr Loomis, who is played by overacting Donald Pleasance. (But he is good enough to make the sequils.) Altogether, this makes one of the most scary movies ever.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Many musicians/producers/record companies today try to develop their image as great musical innovators who \\"break new ground\\" in terms of musical trends.  Most of what I hear these days is fusty, reheated leftovers (from one of the last four decades) that is repackaged with a fresh face then sold as new and original by the money hungry record company wonks.  Innovation should not be defined as trying to guess what will be popular next - innovation requires a Sea Change. <br /> <br />The term Sea Change is defined by Webster's Dictionary as \\"a marked change: TRANSFORMATION\\"  This album truly represents a musical transformation for Beck with gentle inspiration from Nigel Goodrich (the notable producer of Radiohead - another truly innovative band).  Back to Beck - I love the fact that you can count on him to be totally unreliable when it comes to consistency of his music.  That's why critics \\"in the know\\" place Beck in the same circles as Miles Davis and David Byrne - Great Musical Innovators! <br /> <br />From album to album, Beck really doesn't seem to care what critics or fans want as he marches to his own spaced out drum.  From the moment he came on the scene, Beck has mixed musical styles in ways that other artists can't even begin to imagine.  The way Davis fused Jazz and improvisation or Byrne took us across different continents of the world in every new album, Beck puts Pop, Country, Hip-Hop and Rock all in a blender and mixes up some totally original sounds.  <br /> <br />Many reviews refer to Sea Change as being inundated in \\"a cloud of mind-numbing melancholy.\\"  Depressing, slow, boring are all adjectives used in reviews and I think that most are missing the true beauty of this album.  Beck basks in the glow of a \\"Sunday Sun\\" (one of the songs on Sea Change), with his feet up in a hammock, a perfectly cold beer at his side whispering relax . . . relax . . . relax . . .    <br /> <br />This album reminds me of long lost days of youth when time didn't have anyvalue, stress was no where to be found and you could afford to just let your life float slowly \\"Around The Bend\\" (another GREAT track on this album).  All twelve songs are poignant works of soul resonance in a format and combination that's hard to resist.  This is music worth listening to as opposed to playing in the background as NBC did with \\"Golden Age\\" at the end of the this year's World Series - Sea Change deserves better than a fate as TV commercial music!!!!      <br /> <br />Go ahead, buy this album, flip on your stereo, crank up the volume, lay on the couch with a cold beer and immerse yourself in Beck's Sea Change.   <br /> <br />Try it, you'll like it. . . but make sure to  R  E  L  A  X  ! <br />

B00005JKGO|5.0|For those who have been raised on soap operas, La Dolce Vita may be a movie that is, in many ways, difficult to grasp. As opposed to portraying a central character with either a fixed purpose or definite goal, Federico Fellini introduces the audience to Marcello Rubini, an Italian tabloid reporter who struggles to find meaningful aspirations in life. <br /> <br />Adeptly played by Marcello Mastroianni, Rubini is not the type of leading role personality that many audiences will be frequently exposed to. He is neither protagonist nor antagonist. He is, instead, a juxtaposition of paradoxes. For instance, he comes across as a great Italian lover who has finally found the woman of his dreams, only to rediscover hours later that he cannot commit himself to any one person. Throughout, Rubini constantly puts himself in start-and-stop modes, implicitly advertising himself as a socialite one day only to withdraw himself into utter isolation later in the evening. <br /> <br />From one scene to the next, Rubini seems to want to reach out to those around him, but for some reason, he ultimately decides not to. It is as if he has an invisible wall that somehow separates himself from the rest of society, and the perceived complexities that he either creates for himself or else are created for him evolve and never seem to subside. Perhaps the movie was a parallel to a mid-life crisis phase that Fellini was about to enter. <br /> <br />Near the conclusion, Rubini is essentially faced with a decision that one might extrapolate as a Heaven or Hell option. Either way, it seems as if Rubini will continue his course only to change routes and then pass from one interest to another. One might argue that he is a hedonist, but Rubini, to me, is not exactly that. He is like the dog who loves the wheel and will get up close to it but not close enough for contact. <br /> <br />La Dolce Vita, interestingly enough, means The Sweet Life. However, I don't think that Rubini's life would be describedas sweet, but it would not be classified as bitter. Just as Rod Serling's Twilight Zone was described as a world between shadow and substance, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, though not an episode with any fifth-dimensional references, is an interesting portrayal of a man whose role in life seems to fall somewhere between participant and observer. And this facet which, perhaps, plays to the strengths of the movie's brilliance would not be the most useful tool in this age of shallow, Hollywood blockbusters. <br /> <br />All in all, five for five for La Dolce Vita. It is an interesting and highly daring focus on early 1960's Italian pop and underground cultures that might come across as shocking to some viewers over forty years later. <br /> <br />Viva La Dolce Vita! <br />
0880389052|5.0|RA Salvatore has practically spawned a cult of the drow within the realm of AD&D gaming with his classic dark elf hero Drizzt Do'Urden. This long-awaited book takes the reader into the origins of Our Hero and explores the rich world of Menzoberranzan, city of the drow. Even if you don't play the game, you'll love this adventure. If you do play the game, you'll find a wealth of material for your group. Salvatore gives us a new hero in Drizzt's father Zak'naefein, and a Queen B you'll love to hate in his wicked mother Malice (who is more than aptly named). If you haven't read the Icewind Dale trilogy, don't worry - this series is complete in itself. But prepare to be hooked and snared into the web of the Spider Queen.......

068987474X|5.0|Most relationship-help books for women make the tragic mistake of assuming that any man is gettable so long as the woman changes her body, brain or values, plays manipulative mind games, or learns to think the supposedly complex thoughts of men. What trash. Men know what they want and they go for it. Case closed. Any woman who has been relentlessly pursued by a creep knows this well enough. So why don't women apply this logic of male behaviour when the guy in question is someone they like? That's precisely what Behrendt and Tuccillo invite you to do in this book. The principles are pretty simple. Most men are \\"verbally uncommunicative\\" when it comes to their emotions - that is, we're usually too weak to say, \\"I don't like you\\". But, as Behrendt and Tuccillo make clear, our actions say it all. Men aren't afraid of commitment. We're just afraid of committing to someone we don't love. This book is curiously liberating for men, too. Too often we're made to feel guilty about breaking up, like we're morally obliged to continue an abortive relationship with a woman even after we've realized she isn't \\"the one\\". But no transformative pop-psych voodoo is ever going to create romantic bliss out of two people who simply aren't compatible, but too scared to face up to the truth. This is a wonderful wake up call for single women, and a godsend for men. If the phone isn't ringing ladies, move on - because he already has.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I'm going to make this short and quick, if you watched the movie without reading the book first then you were probably like me, confused and a little frustrated as to what the hell was going on.  I ended up buying and reading the book to find out just how much info they left out and how everything connected finally with what was going on in the movie.  Trust me, READ THE BOOK! <br />Another thing, if they purposely made the movie confusing to get people to buy/read the book, it worked. ;)
B00005JNEI|5.0|What's with all the right-wing vitriol being expended on this film? For a bunch of people so apparently resolute on spreading the joy of \\"freedom\\" throughout the world, it's odd to see conservatives getting so enraged when an American exercises a bit of it at home. Sure, you might disagree with Moore's views. Sure, you might accuse him of presenting only one side of the story. But go make your own movie. Isn't that what a free press is all about? I'm sure you won't have trouble getting financial backing or a distribution deal. Fox News runs equally biased, equally risible \\"news\\" every day. I rarely agree with most of what Moore says, but I adore the fact that he says it and the way he goes about the task. His work is both a consequence and a cause of a truly functional democracy. Look at what it's achieved - people are finally talking about the issues; they're wondering if what Moore says is true; they're doing their own research and making up their own minds. If the conservatives are right, then truth will out and they'll be justified - so what have they got to worry about? If the conservatives are lying, then truth will out - and they'll get what they deserve. That's the way it's meant to work, even in Florida. So what's the problem? Moore isn't anti-American, he's simply anti the abuse of power. For my money, that makes him a true patriot. Like Gore Vidal, Moore sees the difference between the American Republic, and the American Global Empire which is its most dangerous enemy - and until conservative Americans learn to separate the flag, the Presidency and moral righteousness, and see that unthinking worship of any one of them can be used as a smokescreen for the debasement of the others, then the fear of seeming \\"unpatriotic\\" will be used to frighten and manipulate Americans to whatever ends those in power choose. I'm simultaneously delighted and disgusted by the existence of \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\": delighted that America is still a nation where a citizen can mount this kind of attack on the government and live to tell the tale, and disgusted that the Presidency has been dragged to such depths by the Bush-Cheney junta that a wildly accusatory film like this is needed as a corrective. And as far as the claim that this is \\"propaganda\\" is concerned - sure it is, but give me a break ... conservatives still stroking their decks of \\"Iraq's Most Wanted\\" playing cards have lost all right to that claim.his kind of attack on the government and live to tell the tale, and disgusted that the Presidency has been dragged to such depths by the Bush-Cheney junta that a wildly accusatory film like this is needed as a corrective.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Let me begin by saying this is a completely enthralling movie.  I wept at the plight of three little girls walking across Australia and dodging the evil Tracker who would take them back to captivity.  But the movie is not a true account in the sense of children being ripped from their mothers and locked away from their own society.  And the word \\"genocide\\" is thrown around capriciously and without regard to its meaning. <br /> <br />Genocide is the murder of a race of people.  The children who were relocated were fed, clothed, given an education and (horror of horrors) a Christian value base.  For anyone who would like to take the time and read the other side of \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\", may I recommend an article by Keith Windschuttle which can be accessed at this web address:  [...]     <br /> <br />Again, the movie itself is top drawer, but should in no way be considered a truthful history of the treatment of aborigines in the mid-20th century, nor should it ever be used for educational purposes as it is in error.
B000005S37|5.0|Sorry, but I had a profound spiritual experience when I heard this album all the way through for the first time (I'd previously heard a few snippets of it on Dr. Demento).  Like another reviewer said, this album sounds exactly like the inside of my head.  I never knew someone else on earth heard that sound, and Lou actually captured it, whether on purpose or not. <br /> <br />The best pranks run so amok that nothing is ever the same again.  Metal Machine Music is such a prank.  It was the beginning of the end of rock's tyranny over the cutting edge.  It's the reason I traded in Bob Dylan for Aphex Twin as my favorite artist.  It was one of the defining moments of a career that defined the term \\"anti-hero.\\"  It's punishing in a good way.  Thank-you-sir-may-I-have-another!

1591840562|4.0|There is one thing that I love about this book:  the dedication page.  Guy dedicates the book to his three children with, \\"A child is the ultimate startup, and I have three.  This makes me rich.\\"  It was this dedication alone that inspired me to buy this book.  Unfortunately, VC's don't care whether you love your children or not.  They just want to make a quick buck, then cash out before you mess things up.<br /><br />Most of the advice is useful.  Some great points:  1) focus on building a great company rather than on trying to get funded/rich, 2) be realistic, 3) practice, practice, practice before you get in front of anyone (customer, angel, VC).<br /><br />With the exception of the \\"minichapter\\" on The Art of Internal Entrepreneuring and a suggestion that you should wear a jacket and tie when pitching on the East Coast, the book is most applicable to people launching brand new companies in Silicon Valley.  If you are launching an internal startup or hoping to get East Coast/European financing, keep in mind that this is a conceptual book.  You will need strong business, marketing and financial plans before anyone will take you seriously.

B000002HMH|4.0|This album continued and exaggerated the trend that the black album started.  It's much more... \\"rockish\\" or \\"mainstream\\" than their albums from the 80s that demonstrated speed metal at its finest.  To me, this album depicts the depth of Metallica's talent.  How many bands do you know of that could dramatically change their sound, even style, and do it well?  These guys are musicians.  Most people over the age of 35 will disagree with me, but they are.  Unlike many of my fellow Metallica fans, I don't believe they \\"sold out.\\"  This album is still Metallica, and it is very good.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I don't believe everyone (my grandmother) will appreciate it.  However, if you like Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Bush, Silverchair, etc... then this album is recommended for you.
B000006CCG|4.0|In 1984, a friend played a cassette featuring a song called Animal. The story was that the label refused to release it. Naturally we all had to hear it. Despite it's controversy, animal is actually a damn catchy little number. <br /> <br />Later that year, I snuck into First Ave(Mpls nightclub) to see Armored Saint, Metallica and....WASP! The whole reason for going was to see WASP and their legendary stage show. The two opening bands were awesome(looking back it is funny to think of a time when Metallica was just an underground band with a buzz) but Blackie Lawless and co made the night special. Blackie stepping out, 6'6 with boots and a buzz-saw blade on his cod piece, left a definite impression. I walked away hooked on this band that was too dangerous for mid-America. <br /> <br />On this re-release of the album that started it all, Animal is included, along with Show No Mercy and Paint It Black. As I said, despite it's subtitle, Animal is actually a decent song. <br /> <br />The album proper starts out with I Wanna Be Somebody, a thundering number that is the quintessential teen anthem, even now I want to raise my fist in the air and my teen years are long behind me. L.O.V.E. Machine follows and is a mid tempo dong about...well...not really love but sex. Hey, Blackie wrote it, you can't really expect it to be sentimental. School Daze is a far nastier song than Alice Cooper's Schools out. \\"Fire Bell is ringing hell and I'd sure like to see it blaze.....BURN IT DOWN!\\"  <br />Songs like Tormentor and The Torture Never Stops certainly added to W.A.S.P.'s reputation as being satanic and sinister. Sleeping In The Fire is beautiful and dark. <br /> <br />Honestly, this album has a dated sound, but the songs are still enjoyable after all these years. The truth is that W.A.S.P. put out a heavy, tight album of catchy tunes. I would certainly buy it again, especially this version with the bonus cuts.

0393035158|4.0|Sam Harris book offers a refreshing and much-needed analysis of the failure of religion and the devastating effect that faith-based ignorance has had on human progress. The End of Faith postulates an age when mankind is no longer ruled by fictitious gods, but realistically recognizes this may be generations in the future. In the meantime, Harris advises, we need to work with whatever moderate elements exist within Islam (which he correctly identifies as the most dangerous of all the religions) to blunt the aggressiveness of Muslim fundamentalists. Harris arguments, sound within themselves, lose some of their force when he debates the need for spiritual experience in the human consciousness.
0452284392|4.0|Complexity can be redefined into pattern and pattern redefined into relationship and process. In doing that we feel in control or at least a little comforted. We feel that all things are interrelated, linked. Professor Barabasi makes a compelling case for this in his book, Linked.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone with the least bit of system or pattern recognition and the hunch that it's all related. Linked does not go off in either extreme: spirituality or quantum physics. The grounding is thoughtful and welcome.<br /><br />My only contrary thought and I thank the author for raising it in me, is how do we unlink? Is it possible? Is it welcome? These questions come more from a personal psychological perspective. This book has opened a new area for me to ponder. Thanks.
0783231032|3.0|More is explained in the DVD version (didn't see the laser disc one) than the 1979 release. In the original cut the characters and storylines were left looking unfinished. The film would have done better at the box office if they'd released this longer, epic version. My favorite scene is when Loomis Birkhead (Tim Matheson), while trying to impress his comely new girlfriend (Nancy Allen) is mistaken for a Jap and to prove he isn't one on stilts he gets a hard kick in the leg.
B000005RQ0|4.0|Being a Deep Purple - Mark-II fan I always gave Whitesnake a stepmotherly treatment. This album I realy like.    The only album I realy listend to by the band was 'lovehunter', I also have some later albums which I listen to occasionally.    I bought the 'Lovehunter' CD yesterday and here is my review based on long listening over 15 years and a couple yesterday.    This is a bluesy rock album with some realy great songs.    The classic here is 'Walking in the shadow of the blues' a realy great blues song with great guitar work Bernie.    'Help me through the day' is another slow blues song which is brought alive by David Coverdale.    The other songs are the traditional '70's rock and roll mixed with simple but pleasent arrangements by David Coverdale & team and having the regular Coverdale lyrics of love, suggestive sex and sex.    'Outlaw' is a song which has Bernie Marsden on the vocals. More on the American '70s rock tradition with lyrics not the cliche David coverdale penchant for love, women & sex. This song breaks the monotony of the later half of the album.    All in all a great album one of the better ones by Whitesnake, First half of the album is real classic stuff, the second pretty average with the exception of 'outlaw'.     This album has more roots than the later albums by the band like '1987', 'Slip of the tongue' which were an overdose of giving the masses what they wanted.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is without doubt one of the best albums I have ever bought. buy it and see what you think. The guitar chords are simplisic but effective and extremely catchy. This album will infect your head with catchy lyrics and sounds. There is not one bad song on it.This is an album you will either love or hate but I love it
B000005L86|5.0|This music sounds as ancient as the Earth, as the Universe.  It reverberates with the same eternal vibrations that inhabit life.  Lee Perry is at his best, and The Congos vocalizing is beyond measure.  It is a perfect combination, you could listen to this album on repeat forever, and it would never grow old.  You listen to this album not only with your ears, but with your soul, it is of the same iration.  I have to rate it five stars, but it transcends rankings, listen and feel.

B00005JLH2|1.0|OK... first of all, yes, where is the marching in this? They should not be called a \\"marching band\\" if they have no marching going on. This movie is the lamest thing I've ever seen. My friend and I made the mistake of renting it last summer, and we just laughed through the whole thing. It's pretty dumb. And I just finished watching it again because my brother, who is in a REAL marching band, wanted to watch it, but we just laughed through the whole thing too. It is such a joke.  And yeah, if you need to play \\"popular\\" music and have a rapper at your show to sound good, then you need to go back to learn REAL music. Marching band is NOT an army, there's discipline and stuff but it's not even that bad. And marching band is about just playing the music, not playing to win. I think my brother's high school band could seriously take on all these bands and really kick some [...]. Obviousy the people who wrote this music, had no intention of attracting the musically educated audience. If you're gonna dance and \\"bust some moves\\" or whatever that was, then don't call yourselves a \\"marching\\" band if you don't have any marching going on. If you're a good band, you hold your instrument either parallel to the ground or above, obviously in Drumline they're all weak and can't hold their instruments right!!     And yeah, this movie seems like it's trying to show that if you keep whining, you'll eventually get what you want.     And to add to what my title is, there are some bands that add some dancing to add to their general effect, but I wasn't aware that I was in to watch a bunch of \\"dancing\\" bands. Just stop calling yourselves marching bands because you're not lol.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann's new thriller cannot boast the ingenious script -- it's full of holes -- but it is still a taut, stylish one with good acting from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  It's not long and self-important saga of 'Ali'; it's more like 'Heat' where tension rises as characters are driven to the edges. <br /> <br />It's Los Angels Airport, where the story starts.  Tom Cruise's guy Vincent receives a bag from another guy (slyly cast cameo of the British star of 'Transporter').  Vincent, apparently a cool businessman on trip, has to do some jobs within a day, as you see later. <br /> <br />And Jamie Foxx is a taxi driver Max, hard-working, honest, and believing that he can do his own business one of these days, and has spent more than 10 years doing the same thing.  Now, Vincent hires Max, offering a lucrative ride, which turns out a very unusual one, for at the first place the taxi are headed for, a dead body falls down from the fourth floor. <br /> <br />Right, this is a change of pace for Tom Cruise, Mr. Nice Guy whose CV includes 'Top Gun' and 'Mission Impossible.'  This time, however, he plays a calculating, chilly man from underworld, who knows how to kill without mercy, but has his own philosophy of life.  It's contradicatory, but Tom Cruise manages to be the merciless killer with great skills. <br /> <br />Besides Jamie Foxx who is very convincing as Mr. Everyman  easily intimidated at first, but gradually changing to somebody else, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill appear, plus Irma P Hall ('The Ladykiller') who adds a precious tone of comic relief to the noir. <br /> <br />But the film is without doubt Mann's, or I should say, Mann's images of LA at night.  He not only lives in the city, but knows the city, and the 'sprawling' city ('Vincent's word) with many faces plays the most important role in the film. <br /> <br />The most regrettable thing is the story of Stuart Beattie which is full of plot-holls.  Think about it.  A realprofessional killer would drive his own car, instead of taking a cab, for instance, and the such items as the silly FBI or ineffective witness protection belong to the B movie cliche. <br /> <br />Still, Mann succeeds in making the film quite gripping  thriller, with the great use of LA landscapes.  Don't think too much when watching it.  Just prepare to be entertained.
B000001ELL|1.0|WHYY??????????? <br /> <br />This album sent Kiss into the gutters for years.  It was made for the wrong reasons.  Kiss was always the anti-disco and they did this.  I wouldn't recomend this album if your looking for rightous rock. <br /> <br />The only reason it deserves 1 star is because of Ace and his kick ass playing.
1567184855|5.0|\\"Are you afraid of death? Do you wonder what is going to happen to you after your die? Is it possible you have a spirit which came from somewhere else and will return there after your body dies, or is this just wishful thinking because you are afraid?\\" --Dr. Michael Newton in Journey of Souls - Case Studies of Life Between Lives<br /><br />At one time or another, everyone wonders what happens to them when they die, and what lies beyond the grave. In his book Journey of Souls - Case Studies of Life Between Lives, Hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton chronicles the experiences of 29 people that were under deep hypnosis and their experiences between lives. Many books have been written about past lives, but this book addresses what happens between lives.<br /><br />Dr. Newton did not set out to regress people beyond their current earthly lives. In fact, as a skeptic by nature and one oriented towards traditional therapy, he resisted requests to do past-life regression--feeling that this was unorthodox and unethical. However, one of his clients complained of a lifetime of chronic pain on his right side, and during one of their regular sessions, the client made stabbing motions to describe the kind of pain he felt. When searching for an explanation for this client's choice of images, he uncovered that his client had a past life as a WWI solider that was killed by a bayonet in France. Through this discovery, they were able to eliminate this pain altogether.<br /><br />He then began to do past life regressions, but then stumbled on a discovery of enormous proportions: he found that it was possible to see into the spirit world through the mind's eye of a hypnotized subject who could report back to him about life between lives.<br /><br />Dr. Newton explains:<br /><br />\\"The research was painfully slow, but as the body of my cases grew I finally had a working model of the eternal world where our souls live. I found thoughts about the spirit world involve universal truths among the souls of people living on Earth. It was these perceptions by so many different types of people which convinced me that their statements were believable. I am not a religious person, but I found the place where we go after death to be one of order and direction, and I have come to appreciate that there is a grand design to life and afterlife.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Newton shares actual dialogue culled from audio recordings of regression sessions between he and his clients about what happens at the gate of death, who meets us on the other side, what we do once we're there, the purpose of our life, the role of guides, the nature of karma, cluster \\"study groups\\", inter-soul communication, what happens to \\"disturbed\\" souls, aura colors, the different levels of souls, and much more.<br /><br />I found Journey of Souls utterly fascinating, as well as Dr. Newton's sequel Destiny of Souls. However, my experience with these books was much more than mere intellectual fascination: both my husband and I experienced an utter paradigm shift about the afterlife, the Creator, and the purpose of life. Up until reading these books, I was still on the fence about reincarnation, and my husband's perspective was \\"no way!\\" The compelling regression sessions chronicled in this book convinced us otherwise, largely because of the consensus among regressed clients and how their reports confirmed some spiritual notions we were discovering on our own through direct experience.<br /><br />No other model made sense to either one of us; we long concluded that there was no literal hell, but what of suffering on Earth? Are our bodies, and our lives, completely random and arbitrary? Is it really possible we live more than one life? Why are we born into the family we are, especially if it results in abuse or pain?<br /><br />In these books we discovered that individuals carefully choose his or her own body and life circumstances to bring about certain experiences and to draw the soul closer to the perfection of the Creator. The whole point of incarnating is for self development. Yet, no one is rushed back into incarnating, and every soul has a chance to enter a dimension of time/space to \\"try out\\" a life and decide if this is the best choice for their own path.<br /><br />On the other side, there is playfulness, exploration, role playing, lessons, growth, past life examination, and so on. It is a place of rest, healing, rejuvenation, and self-examination. There are \\"schools\\" and our learning is a part of a specialized soul group. We have guides who teach us how to work with energy, and others who open up \\"books of life\\" so we can scrutinize our past life performance--and decide where we messed up, and how we can best grow in future lives.<br /><br />A helpful aspect of this book is the explanation of why some individuals go through difficult relationships, especially as children:<br /><br />\\"When clients tell me how much they suffered from the actions of family members, my first question to their conscious mind is, 'If you had not been exposed to this person as a child, what would you now lack in understanding?' It may take awhile, but the answer is in our minds. There are spiritual reasons for our being raised as children around certain kinds of people, just as other people are designated to be near us as adults...<br /><br />...whatever happens to us in life, it is important we understand that our happiness or pain does not reflect either blessings or betrayal on the part of a God-oversoul, our guides, or life selection coordinators. We are the master of our own destiny.\\"<br /><br />Most encouraging though, especially to those who fear a vengeful God awaiting them after death, is that we are not condemned or punished in the afterlife. Newton writes:<br /><br />\\"All soul evaluation conferences, be they with our guides, peers, or a panel of masters have one thing common. The feedback and past life analysis we receive in terms of judgment is based upon the original intent of our choices as much as the actions of our lifetime. Our motivations are questioned and criticized, but not condemned in such a way as to make us suffer.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend Journey of Souls, especially if you're searching for answers about the meaning of your life, why things happen, and what happens after death. Truly, we are never alone and are always surrounded by a supportive \\"great cloud of witnesses\\".<br /><br />Janet Boyer, author of [[ASIN:1571745874 The Back in Time Tarot Book: Picture the Past, Experience the Cards, Understand the Present]] (coming Fall 2008 from Hampton Roads Publishing)pment.

0800177177|4.0|Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of the often filmed Bram Stoker classic is still a stunning achievement to this day.  Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as the immortal count and Winona Ryder gives one of the best performances of her career as his star crossed lover Mina Murray.  Keanu Reeves is alright as Jonathan Harker, even though his accent isn't particularly pulled off well, while Anthony Hopkins and Tom Waits have great fun as vampire hunter Van Helsing and Renfield respectively.  The production, set design, and cinematography are still breathtaking to this day, even though in some spots you can tell just how much the film has aged.  Other than that, this is still one Dracula that you can't go wrong with.  The cast also features Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell, Richard E. Grant, Sadie Frost, and Monica Bellucci.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is outstanding. It's a beautiful love story and probably one of the best roles I have ever seen Jim Carey and Kate Winslet in.(Elijah's wood character was wonderful too, very creepy and nerdy but he played it so well :) ). This movie makes one see how we don't realize how important something is to us(like love)until we don't have it anymore. It also let's us know how important memories are and whether they are good or bad we shouldn't ever forget them because those memories help make us the people we are, we learn from our memories. <br />
0140277447|5.0|Read all reviews, some guys obviously from Japan criticzied this book for faking or from PRC progangda, but , please , read it by yourself, judge by yourself.  <br />After I read this book, I give 5 star to this book, it is really worth for reading.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Only die-hard fans will enjoy, and notice exactly where the 49 minutes have been added. I thought the extra 49 minutes was unnecessary and just dragged out scenes (e.g camera fixed on one pointless spot for too long in an attempt to be 'arty'), so really this is a review for Apocalypse Now normal version.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now is unlike other Vietnam war films, don't expect another Platoon type film based solely on the war. Apocalypse Now is simply based on the evil within a man, and the breaking point every man has. It's a deep study on the human psyche, not a study on the war itself. The film will go down as an 'art' classic, this is understandable. The vividness of direction is ahead of it's time (1979), the jungle is made to look like an oil painting at night with it's coloured flares lighting the depths of the jungle. The brief action scenes are full of bright lighting and artistic takes (some bullets fly with red trails, yellow trails, completely unrealistic but stylish). The famous bombing scene with Duvall and the helicopters is shot wounderfully, classical music booming, bright coloured flares and bizzare flourescent explosions. Capped off with the famous line of \\"ah, I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\\"<br /><br />The plot is very simple, Martin Sheen must find Marlon Brando who is a highly skilled, highly intelligent man who has simply gone mad due to the war. He almost has an army that follow him in fright, every day he goes out and kills some, and leaves the carcass outside to rot. He creates his own hell. By the time Sheen finds him, he himself is fighting inside, trying his best not to succomb to the harsh environment. You sense Sheen feels for Brando, and vice versa. The film takes a deep plunge into both man's minds, and it's intiguing to say the least.
0140277447|5.0|We deeply miss Iris Chang already in the days after her death.  She was a favorite writer of mine, and definitely among the best of current popular historians.  Her work is both scholarly and superbly readable, suffused with feeling for history's victims, and anger at cruelty and injustice.  This led some critics to fault her for bias, and this book is off the mark in assuming that Japanaese are united in denying the Rape of Nanking.  But her passionate partisanship compels attention to overlooked injustices of modern history.  This is the common thread running through all her work (\\"Rape of Nanking,\\" Chinese in America,\\" Thread of the Silkworm\\").  The grim subjects she dealt with possibly played a part in the circumstances leading to her death, although we should refrain from passing judgement.  Iris was researching a book on Americans fighting Japanese in the Philippines during the Pacific War.  We can only hope that enough progress was made so that one final gem will appear under her name.  She continues to inspire others to follow the trails she blazed.

B00004BZ16|4.0|Sandinista! is the classic \\"difficult follow-up\\" record, and here, The Clash took the experimentation of London Calling and ran with it. They ran with it far into vast dimensions that can't even be fathomed. <br />Of course, this record is going to be a mess; it's 2 CD's that reach well into their spacing constraints. But I'm going to take the opinion less accepted and say that the record sounds really consistent. For a while anyway. By the last half of the second disc, the record begins to fall apart into odd dub experiments that are too strange for their own good. And the child-choir version of \\"Career Opportunities\\"? A cute gimmick sure, but necessary? <br />However, the first 3/4 are brilliant. Let's look at the highlights: \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" Hitsville U.K.,\\" \\"One More Time,\\" \\"Somebody Got Murdered,\\" \\"The Call-Up,\\" \\"Junco Partner,\\" \\"Police On My Back,\\" \\"Charlie Don't Surf,\\" etc. Really, there's something you'll enjoy here, and if you're a devoted music fan, you'll give the record the time it needs to sink in.

The tune - \\"All Alone at Christmas,\\" sung by the wonderful Darlene Love and written by Little Steven VanZant.  The song, so far as I know, was previously only available on the \\"Home Alone 2\\" soundtrack. <br /> <br />I was hugely disappointed to discover the track was missing from the \\"Love Actually\\" soundtrack. <br /> <br />The cold wind is blowin' and the streets are getting dark <br />I'm writing you a letter and I don't know where to start <br />The bells will be ringing Saint John the Divine <br />I get a little lonely every year around this time <br /> <br />The music plays all night in Little Italy <br />The lights will be going up on old Rockefella's tree <br />People window shopping on Fifth Avenue <br />All I want for Christmas is you <br /> <br />(Tell me) I've got to know <br />Where do lonely hearts go <br />Because nobody ought to be all alone on Christmas <br /> <br />Anyway - the soundtrack is very well done, but in my opinion, would have been over the top with this last addition.
B000005IU2|5.0|That's for sure. Really, even with the current fetishism for garage rock and old-school punk that's come about recently, can you see any band currently in existence putting out a record like Fun House? My god, it's simply one of the most filthy, ugly, raunchy, and abrasive records to ever released under the rock n' roll banner. And it's beautiful in its own way because of that. I'm a firm believer in the theory that passion trumps talent. And despite whatever technical skills may be lacking, the guys sure keep it together enough to let the music bleed with a certain primal quality that hasn't been found since. This record was recorded in 1970, and it still sounds more dangerous than anything coming out nowadays. The five stars is a given.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|To lose someone like this in music is nothing short of a travesty.

DON\\"T PASS ON  EXPERIENCING THIS CD!!! <br />Love and Life,  <br />Rich  <br /> <br />
B0006213WG|4.0|This album is a huge improvement for this band.  They get better with each album.  They are by far the best of the pop-punk bands. <br /> <br />1. Intro -- just a short instrumental, nothing special <br /> <br />2. No Reason (9/10) -- One of their heaviest tracks ever.  Killer chorus.  2nd best song on the album. <br /> <br />3. We're All to Blame (9/10) -- Sounds like a punk version of System of a Down's \\"Chop Suey.\\"  It's the best song on the album, and the best song Sum 41 has ever done. <br /> <br />4. Angels With Dirty Faces (6/10) -- Another heavy song, but drags through the verses.  The chorus isn't bad. <br /> <br />5. Some Say (8/10) -- Softer song, sounds like some of the songs from their 2nd album, \\"All Killer No Filler.\\" <br /> <br />6. The Bitter End (6/10) -- Here's a real heavy song for these guys.  Sounds A LOT like Metallica's \\"Battery.\\"  Nice guitar solos here, but the vocals aren't too good. <br /> <br />7. Open Your Eyes (8/10) -- Another song with a great chorus.  Nice guitar work in the verses. <br /> <br />8. Slipping Away (7/10) -- Softest song I've ever heard from this band.  Very well placed in the album as a break between the heavier stuff. <br /> <br />9. I'm Not the One (7/10) -- Great intro, sounds like Linkin Park.  Another powerful chorus like tracks 2 & 7, but not as good. <br /> <br />10. Welcome to Hell (6/10) -- Short power-punk song.  Sounds like The Offspring. <br /> <br />11. Pieces (9/10) -- This should definitely be the next single.  It's the best of the 3 softer songs on the album, and it's their best chance for cross-over success.  Has \\"Top 40\\" written all over it. <br /> <br />12. There's No Solution (7/10) -- Another great intro, and another great chorus.  A little slower than most of the other songs on the album, but still pretty heavy. <br /> <br />13. 88 (6/10) -- Starts off like a typical Sum 41 song, then gets real soft for the first verse, but the rest of the song is pretty typical.  Nothing special here. <br /> <br/>14. Noots (bonus track) (5/10) -- Doesn't suck, but its pretty boring.  The chorus is decent though. <br /> <br />15. Moron (bonus track) (5/10) -- Intro sounds like Green Day.  Another pretty boring song with a decent chorus. <br /> <br />16.Subject to Change (bonus track) (7/10) -- Long intro, which isn't bad.  Guitar work in the verse reminds me of Papa Roach from their Infest album, and the chorus is almost identical musically to the one in \\"No Reason,\\" but the lyrics here sound stupid.
0140277447|5.0|History should not be forgotten, never. After I read this book, I was deeply shocked by the inhumane cruelty of japaneses. I told me myself that they were not human but animals. I can't understand how we can ignore somewhat this huge event. As a student once studied in Nanking, every year this time ( I mean this event) there will be some aerial alarm whistles to remind us of the dead killed by japaneses. These \\"animals\\" snatched our culture their own but attacked us as mad dogs. This book is quite true and valuable to those who know little about the Nanking holocaust. I recommend it seriously to you. The auther is respectful regarding her professional attitude and analysis. The world should remember that unforgettable event. And japaneses should be aware of what their progenitors did! They should apologize for that and bow to admit their huge crime!!!

B00008WT49|2.0|My rating of 2 stars applies to the SACD version of this record and not the CD.  I consider the CD to be a 5 star recording.  After carefully listening to both the two channel SACD mix and the CD stereo versions I could not discern an audible difference.  I enjoyed the 5.1 mix and found the rear surround to be tasteful and subtle, not at all distracting, but, again, no significant improvement in detail except that created by spreading the sound around to five channels.  A recent article on the \\"Stereophile\\" website suggests that the SACD mix in fact shares the same 16 bit lineage as the CD, which would explain why the two channel mix and the CD mix sound identical.  Norah's label has cheated its customers with this one and should go back and do an actual DSD mix and replace these \\"CDs\\" for free or give us our money back.  There is no reason to purchase this SACD in addition to or in lieu of the CD unless you are interested in listening to a standard resolution 5.1 mix.
B000002GKT|5.0|I bought this album at Sears in 9th grade 30 years ago, and nothing can send chills up the spine like I Don't Need No Doctor. You hear the sound pushing through the microphones. Intense a live performance as it can get. Marriott is pure Pie, RAW, RAMPANT, REAL. Music just isn't made this way anymore. Buy it.
B0002S947K|5.0|If you've been searching for a new great american singer/songwriter, only to be dissapointed by poor production, lyrical trivality, or lack of depth, try Ray LaMontagne's Trouble. It's rich, deep and very well done.    Upon further listing and one live performance - This is the real deal folks! Do yourself, friends and the neighborhood a huge favor and buy it.     Do I sound a little over enthused? Sure, but have you listened to it? If so you know why.    I'd pay $100.00 to find one more new artist as good. If you know of one please share.

B0000640VN|4.0|<br /> Now imagine, if you will, falling in love with a man your crazed ex-boyfriend claims is from the 19th century? Your brother is convinced said guy is a 'true' actor. Did I mention the punk that stole your purse was pursued on horseback by said guy? <br /> <br /> Poor Kate! She's falling in love, after alot of mishaps, and this is one situation you can't exactly talk your way out of.   <br /> <br />Now, that you're curious go ahead an buy this movie. This is the cutest Romantic/Comedy I've ever seen. The script is tweaked to perfection, the actors definately don't sway from their parts, and Sting's \\"Until\\" song is absolutely perfect with this movie. *psst* The video's on the DVD. <br /> <br />
B0002SROSQ|4.0|Nick Cave is a songwriter of a literary bent. Fair or not I categorize his body of work with Bob Dylan, Tom Waits and, hmm, Mose Allison. Fair or not. I saw the Birthday Party ... twice in fact ... and saw the very first US shows of The Bad Seeds. So I've been following this Cave critter around for something along the lines of two decades. Creepy as that sounds, I've never idolized the fella'. I'd lost track of his work between \\"From Her To Eternity\\" and \\"The Good Son.\\" But once I got my hands on \\"Murder Ballads\\" and \\"Let Love In\\" I've reflexively purchased every new release. This one's mighty good. Like Dylan, Waits and Mose before him, Cave continually finds new inroads into singularly-focused topics that motivate him to write more tunes. He's looking at a diamond and continually finding nuances in the glimmer of its facets. But ... in the end ... this music (rather the sound that comes out of the speakers) is noisy to some, obtuse to others and makes my wife yell at me to turn the freakin' record off NOW! As I said, Not for the unconverted.
068987474X|5.0|First - I think this is an excellent book. As a young woman dating, I've fallen into a lot of the traps set forward in this book. As a matter of fact, the friend handed me the book when I was stressing over a guy who \\"just wasn't that into me\\". Not only did it perk me up, I giggled insanely through most of the read. I thought it was well-written, and achieved its goal of being both humorous and making an excellent series of points. I'd recommend the book to ANY young, dating woman I know - and to any woman just for a good read. <br /> <br />Second - This book is not meant to change your life. You should realize this before you pick it up - reading a funny self-help book will NOT make you a sex-goddess or the perfect woman or even a decent person. If you think that it will, go sign yourself up for some therapy and save us all a lot of time. <br /> <br />For all of you complaining that men shouldn't be lumped together, blah blah blah.. we know. I know. You know. They know. We know. <br /> <br />This book is meant to give a second perspective on a sensitive issue - how men will tell you, subtly or not, whether or not they're into you. It isn't meant to change your life after one night. Yes, it's funny. That only helps to drive the points home - where some self-help books put you on the defensive, this one entertains and draws you in. Defensive people don't learn. Entertained people do. <br /> <br />So read the book. Have a good laugh. And then examine your dating style - if you're making excuses for losers (or good guys who just aren't diggin you), you'll see it pretty quickly. If not, you had a good laugh, didn't you?
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I have been a Dream Theater fan for many, many years. I own every album, single, video, and most of the side projects, and I have seen these guys in concert a couple of times. I always thought that they were something really special- for me they combined the best of progressive musicianship with good, thoughtful, and often inspiring lyrics. They have had disappointing moments over the years (I never did like Falling Into Infinity much either, but it was better than this), but all in all, their career was fantastic until this album.  <br />In my opinion Train of Thought lacks inspiration and heart. I enjoy Dream Theater's heavy songs- don't get me wrong. Caught In A Web has always been one of my favorites, for instance. So, its not the heaviness of the album that bothers me. Its that this one lacks the variety that their previous albums have shown- the expressiveness and the creativity which are the hallmarks of their sound for me. It also has the worst lyrics they have ever produced, and since their lyrics are also an integral part of the experience for me, this came as a huge disappointment. An angry Dream Theater song, from time to time, is a good thing. An entire album of the same gloomy facade is not. I think I might even have been able to handle an angry album from them if I had thought that there was any sincerity in it, but I really don't think thats the case with Train of Thought. <br />This album is an entirely lack-luster collection of songs from a band who has brought its fans so much diversity and spirit in the past. I hope that they will eventually produce something better, but for the first time since I originally heard them, I am not anticipating the next album. I'm not giving up on them either though. I'm just disappointed.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|VAMPIRE HUNTER VAN HELSING [HUGH JACKMAN] GOES TO TRANSYLVANIA WITH THE INTENT OF PUTTING AN END TO DRACULA. TOO MUCH UNNECESSARY SPECIAL EFFECTS, BAD ACTING, BAD ACTION, NO THRILLS, BAD PLOT, PREDICTABLE PLOT TWISTS, UNNECESSARILY LONG RUNNING TIME, AND WHEN YOU ADD THIS ALL UP, YOU GET THIS MOVIE, WHICH IS ABOUT AS MUCH FUN AS WATCHING ONE OF THOSE STUPID REALITY TV SHOWS. HONESTLY, THIS MOVIE ONLY BELONGS IN ONE PLACE: THE TRASH CAN. A BIG WASTE.
B000094DUP|5.0|She's a beautiful, talented young lady who has a lovely strong voice unlike the same ol' Britney, Jessica, Holly and Mandy you hear all the time these days (there are too many of those plain voices around singing about the same ol' thing 'sex')...and Delta doesn't sell her songs through showing off her body in her video's...that's why her fans respect her more. <br />But this album is fantastic, favourites are 'Not me not I', 'Born to try', 'Innocent Eyes' and 'Butterfly'.  All my friends in the U.S. who heard me play this album in my car would ask 'who is this? it's great' and so I gave them all a copy of it and they were thrilled.  We could all relate to some of her songs.  Thank you Delta for not being another barbie wannabe, thank you for showing and proving you have a voice and talent.  You're great live too!
B000002UAU|5.0|To understand this album, you have to understand the Beatles state at that point.  They had already made artistic strives (\\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\"), but it was hard to shake off their image of screaming girls and mindless pop music like \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\".  At this point, they didn't even want to be Beatles.  This ultimately leads to the idea that they can take on this alter-ego of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and create music that is totally outside their musical spectrum.  Neither before or after did the beatles create the music they do on Sgt. Pepper.  Musically and conceptually, the songs on this album are very diverse.  They range from the complex \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" using the synthesizer and a distorted vocal effect, and references to LSD, to the simple \\"She's Leaving Home\\", which uses a harp and violin, that creates the simple story of a daughter leaving because she's unhappy with her family.  Another, retro- favorite, \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", shows that paul doesn't just want to get married but grow old with his wife.  The real masterpiece of this album, however is \\"A Day in the Life\\".  This unloads the pop star image in a big way.  It shows that these guys can write a song filled with meaning.  When the excitement of the Sgt. Pepper Reprise fades into the calm \\"A Day in the Life\\", the creativity and intelligence of these guys shines through.  If you want an album that's extremely artistic, but fun and playful at the same time, get this.

B00009V7RF|5.0|This is the best dance/funk CD that I've heard in a while. I'm not into urban very much, but I love this album. I enjoy the Peas' top 40 hits, especially &quot;Let's get retarded&quot;. The one, non-charting hit that especially impressed me is &quot;The boogie that be&quot;. It's got a fantastic beat and I really dig those funky sirens. They totally make the song! Although it's a very basic dance track that doesn't have a lot of instrumentation, it has such a great sound that totally makes up for it! It reminds me of Daft Punk's &quot;Face to face&quot;, off their album &quot;Discovery&quot;. If you liked &quot;Boogie that be&quot; you will love &quot;Face to face&quot;. Anyway, Elephunk is an excellent CD. Get it, play it, love it!!!
6304698658|5.0|I love this movie. I wish I could let my son watch it, but there's some profanity in it. They do drop the \\"f bomb\\" in it, which is a drag, because if it didn't have the profanity it would be a great family film! Love, love, love this movie.
0140277447|5.0|When someone mentions the word holocaust, most often people will relate that word with the Germans and Jews during World War II. When Japan is mentioned, the first things that come to mind are the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Nanjing Massacre truly has been forgotten.  <br /> <br />Now, the Japanese government denies that such massacres were actually committed in Nanjing. They say it is a story made up by the Chinese. If this story is a lie, then why and how did so many people die? Why are there pictures taken of these brutal acts by the Japanese soldiers? What about the Japanese confessions and their diaries to prove all the things they did? What about the hundreds of thousands of people who witnessed these crimes? What about the trials where many of the high ranking soldiers were found guilty and punished for their injustices? There is too much evidence against the Japanese soldiers to deny such cruelties  <br /> <br />During World War II, so many horrible acts were committed against the innocent. When it was all over, the bodies were countless as well as the tears shed around the world. The Japanese stole the lives of many, and at the same time killed millions of innocent people. The horrible memory of the Nanjing Massacre still lives with many of those who survived through it. With all that happened in such a short amount of time, it's a shame that the Nanjing Massacre is labeled the forgotten holocaust--not only forgotten, but denied by the Japanese executioners.  <br /> <br />
B000002J09|4.0|This may not be the best Led Zeppelin album, but it's definetly the most essential.  It features the rockadelic classic, \\"Black Dog\\" and the Blues inspired personal favorite \\"When the Levee Breaks\\".  The real masterpiece of Led Zeppelin IV, however is the greatest song in Rock'n'Roll, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  I think everybody should have heard enough songs from this album on the radio to know whether they want to buy it or not.
0395389496|4.0|When I was a child, My mother bought me this book expecting to me to like it. When I was finished with it, She thought I hated it. It was just a okay book because do we really need to read about a boy that doesn't believe in santa and all the sudden, a The Polar Express is in his front yard ready to take him a on a magical journey to the north pole. The story is creative, and it has a wonderfully tearful ending when you relize that he belives in Santa. Also most recently, a movie has been released, and it has stayed true to the book.
B00006IUL6|4.0|Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors, but I'm a bit turned off by Hollywood these days so I don't watch too many films, even when he's starring. But with nothing else to do on a 14-hour business-class flight from Chicago to Tokyo, I decided I might as well give it a try. If it bored me, I could always turn the channel to the satellite view of the airplane's flight path. I was happy to see the film's setting was one of my favorite places on earth--Alaska. But I was also nervous. Would Hollywood do a hatchet job on small town Alaska as it does the rest of small town America? To my surprise, \\"Insomnia\\" was a realistic portrayal of small town Alaskan life. It shows that even in Alaska, there are modern, state-of-the-art police technology, and people have cars and them thar real big picture box contraptions. Wow! Did the scriptwriter actually leave his mansion and notice a world beyond the Santa Monica hills? Al Pacino plays a Los Angeles detective who arrives in Alaska to help with a local murder investigation. His performance, as expected, is intense. As it turns out, he volunteered for the Alaska assignment to escape controversy in Los Angeles. Although his character is flawed, I found myself rooting for him to overcome those flaws. The murder mystery intensifies as does the mystery surrounding Pacino's character. The local police trust his judgment, but they sense something just isn't quite right with him, especially one police woman who is suspicious of his motives. What happened back in Los Angeles? The action is suspenseful, the setting inspiring. I highly reccommend this film for people who enjoy Al Pacino, police suspense and Alaska scenery.
6305603847|5.0|I feel like a total fool trying to write a review of \\"Pink Floyd: The Wall.\\" There is almost no point in even attempting to summarize this extraordinarily symbolic and emotionally complex film into a few hundred words. It's like trying to fully explain why you love someone on one side of a postage stamp. But, I'm always eager to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) in order to review nearly everything I see on DVD or read. Why should Pink Floyd's magnum opus be any different? Actually, this film meant more to me roughly fifteen years ago than it does now. Back then I was an impressionable lad with nothing more than a car and Pink Floyd's entire catalogue on CD to my name. More than any of Pink Floyd's other albums, \\"The Wall\\" is probably the one most suited to young people. Its themes of emotional and physical alienation, its strident antiestablishment views toward education, and its bleak condemnation of war resonate most with kids who think they can change the world. By the time you get a few years under your belt, by the time life wears you down a bit and makes you more accepting of the massive hypocrisy we all toil under, the album loses a bit of its luster. Don't get me wrong; \\"The Wall\\" is still one of the best rock operas ever created, and the movie is still worth watching.<br /><br />The story, as though I even need to summarize it, concerns the tumultuous life of troubled rock star Pink (Bob Geldof). Here's a guy who has a whole host of ailments eating away at his soul. It would appear that being rich and famous, immensely talented, and the envy of millions everywhere isn't the type of life one would wish on their worst enemy. First of all, Pink's father perished in the ill-fated attempt to hold the Anzio beachhead in 1944, thus robbing our protagonist of a strong male influence during his childhood. With his father gone forever, Pink grew up under the stern gaze of his domineering mother, which shaped his outlook on future relationships with women. In fact, we see just how difficult it is for Pink to deal with females when he nearly murders a groupie during a rampage through a hotel room and in his growing distance from his pretty wife. Second, Pink didn't function well during his school days. His teachers at school mocked his penchant for writing song lyrics--from \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" no less!--and spent all of their time trying to break down his individualism so they could turn him into a faceless drone. Life is apparently quite tough in merry old England.<br /><br />Don't worry, there are many more dilemmas our hero must deal with before he can tear down wall he built to keep people out so he can reconnect with humanity. The third major problem Pink deals with is his drug addiction, which has spiraled out of control and threatens to claim his life. He's so bad off that he spends most of his off time nodding off in a hotel room watching old war films on television while a cigarette burns to an ash between his fingers. He almost passes over to the other side at one point, but his manager (played by Bob Hoskins) manages to revive him just in time for his next concert performance. Finally (or fourth, whichever you prefer), it seems living the life of a rock star is eerily similar to a career as a fascist dictator. You can march on stage clad entirely in black, wearing an armband with a pair of crossed hammers on it, and preach to the adoring masses. You can order underlings to physically remove riffraff from the room, and send them out into the streets to wreak havoc on the decadent society. Yep, living on stage sure has its problems. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that Pink also undergoes several horrific hallucinations. Good grief! It's amazing most (but not all) of the conclusion is as redemptive as it is.<br /><br />It's impossible to argue that \\"Pink Floyd: The Wall\\" isn't an amazing film. The sights and sounds seen in this movie stay with you for years afterwards: the Gerald Scarfe animation sequences,Geldof's creepy ability to portray a man completely detached from reality, and of course the music. Ahhh, the music! Pink Floyd went back into the studio to rerecord most of the songs, and even added a few more intriguing bits to the mix. It is in this film where one finds what is perhaps the most depressing Floyd song ever, the dirge \\"When the Tigers Broke Free.\\" It's a heartbreaking tune describing the death of Pink's father (also Roger Water's father) at Anzio, and Pink's discovery of a form letter from the King of England, \\"signed with his own rubber stamp,\\" offering condolences to the family for the loss of his father. Soul shattering stuff even though the song probably would fit better on \\"The Final Cut,\\" the album that followed \\"The Wall.\\" I could go and on with the mind blowing stuff in the movie. You definitely wouldn't want to watch this bleak film if you're feeling blue.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"The Wall\\" coming out on DVD are the extras. The commentary track alone, with Gerald Scarfe and Roger Waters, is worth the price of the disc. We finally get to hear exactly what these guys were trying to accomplish with the film. We also get to hear Waters's astonishing admission that his only regret about the movie is that it doesn't contain any humor. Humor? In \\"The Wall\\"? Imagine that! Fans of the greatest rock band in modern history must pick this one up posthaste.

0375758992|5.0|I found that I couldn't put this book down. The author has fantastic insight into her own dysfunctional family. This is a touching survivor's story. A wonderful book, even more so because it's autobiographical. For anyone who loves reading about life in Africa and overcoming adversity in life, this is the book for you. Has a bit of &quot;Nightmares Echo&quot; and &quot;Living Lolita in Tehran&quot; in it. All excellent reads. Highly rated.
B000002J03|5.0|Although I love Led Zeppelin's debut, it's a confused collection of songs by a band that hasn't really found it's sound yet, but on Led Zeppelin II, the line between blues and hard rock starts to blur and Led Zeppelin finds it's own style, set apart from their blues and hard rock heroes.  Two examples of this are the Blues/rock masterpiece \\"The Lemon Song\\" and the smooth, jazzy \\"What is and What Never Should Be\\".  Another favorite of mine is \\"Bring it all Back Home\\" because it just plain rocks, but the real masterpiece of Led II is the opener, \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". It's a hard rock anthem and that opening guitar is classic, like this album.

B000002I25|5.0|I don't think I've heard an album with basslines as smooth as on this one, or a lead singer as great as Jim Morrison.  This is especially true on \\"Light My Fire\\", the bands most successful, and in my opinion, best song.  It features Jim's smooth vocals, and kicks into a bass inspired jam.  \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is another personal favorite. It's just got so much soul, along with \\"Backdoor Man\\".  Now, if you want classic 60's rock'n'roll, my two suggestions are \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" and \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\".  If you want a great rock'n'roll debut, by the Doors self-titled.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I love vampire mythology, especially Anne Rice's vampire chronicles. I have been a fan of Anne's anti-hero the vampire Lestat and his blood-drinking companions since high school. When \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" was going to be turned into a movie, I was a bit wary of the film as was Anne Rice, especially with Tom Cruise in the lead role. I can't blame Anne for being wary of Tom Cruise as Lestat. Much to my surprise, Tom Cruise put in a pretty decent performance as the devilish Lestat. Brad Pitt on the other hand wasn't nearly convincing as the tortured Louis. He wasn't bad but his performance didn't stand out with me. Kirsten Dunst was the perfect Claudia. She was perfect as the demonic child-vampire. Her debut performance was definitely an indication to what to come for this delightful actress. Antonio Banderas as Armand was so miscast. In the books, Armand was much younger when he became a vampire. That was the biggest miscast, not Tom Cruise as Lestat. Armand was only 17 when he became a vampire and Antonio Banderas doesn't exactly look anywhere near 17 years old. I also didn't think Christian Slater was right for the role of Daniel, the mortal that Louis encounters. The film itself was pretty much faithful to the book although the introduction of the film was not nor did the film ended like the novel did. The cinematography was gorgeous. Ten times better than what was in that crudfest called \\"Queen of the Damned\\" (which did not follow the books \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" as it was supposed to be). The film was visual eye candy. It was what I imagined what New Orleans looked like in the early 19th century. I have to admit I have always thought that \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" was not nearly as good as \\"Vampire Lestat\\" or \\"Queen of the Damned\\" but nevertheless, it is still a good book and classic too. Overall I like the film adaptation. Too bad \\"Queen of the Damned\\" was a complete mess no thanks in part of the bad script, and awful directing. \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" may not be flawless but I still enjoy it. It is one of my favorite modern vampire movies.. \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" may not be flawless but I still enjoy it. It is one of my favorite modern vampire movies.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Amazon has to learn how to stop those kids who keep registering 20 or so names hoping to up the rating of SW prequel films just because they were wrong to their friends when LOTR ruled and SW prequels stank. Otherwise, why else would anyone give 5 star ratings to Episodes I and II? There are some good things in Episode I sure. The duel, the great music, a young obi-wan, Portman's brilliant smiles etc. However the movie as a whole doesn't stack up to any of the LOTR films which deserved 5+ stars each and every 17 oscars the trilogy won. Sad to see Jar-Jar while ubiquitously hated, with billboard posters on mainstreets of many cities actually helps Episode I by annoying viewers while AOTC caused a lot of boredom induced sleeping without Jar-Jar because Lucas hasn't directed anything worthy to actually be in a theater since ANH. Episode III may be an improvement since Lucas has used up two movie slots as practice and I will grade it fairly as well. TPM ***, AOTC *1/2, ANH ****, ESB ****, ROTJ **
B00067BBQE|5.0|How refreshing it is to see Evanescence releasing this DVD so shortly after a certain dark-haired little sister known as Ashlee Simpson let so many of her fans down on \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" <br /> <br />Why do I make this comparison? Ashlee Simpson claimed to be edgy, raw and all about the music. She wanted to be everything that Evanesence IS and has been since its earliest beginnings (Yes, I was there. I saw them in concert two days after the release of \\"Fallen.\\")  <br /> <br />Undecided buyer, you can't judge Evanescence by what you've heard on the radio. Understand that you cannot begin to perceive the true power of this band and Ms. Lee's voice until they are seen live, until you can feel the walls shake with their pounding, dark energy. <br /> <br />Though the walls probably won't be shaking (unless you have a killer surround-sound system), I'm sure this DVD will give you a true picture of the way Evanescence can hold and entrance a crowd, just by the sheer power of their emotion and musical talent. <br /> <br />In simplest terms, buy this DVD, you freaking idiot.
B00008WT5M|1.0|There was a period between 1975 and 1982 (between \\"high voltage\\" and \\"Flick of the Swith\\"), when AC/DC could put out albums that sounded, initially, the same but still keep it fresh, but by 1990, these 43 year olds were oblivious to how bad their music was.  They either linger in the past (Fire Your Guns) or took turns into the wrong direction (Thunderstruck), and if \\"Mistriss for Christmas\\" made the final cut, I'd hate to hear the songs that didn't.
B0002OERI0|4.0|When I first heard \\"American Idiot\\", I thought it was the best song ever. I was immediately convinced to by the new Green Day record. I was right. <br />Songs <br />1. American Idiot-(see above)(A little overplayed now, but I still like it) <br />2. Jesus of Surbia- Its a little long, and I don't think I've heard the entire song yet, but maybe someday I will. <br />3. Holiday- AWESOME SONG!!! Great Bush bashing!!! <br />4.Boulevard of Broken Dreams- Call me crazy, but I like Green Day's slower songs than their faster ones. This is a slow one. <br />5.Give me Novacaine- An OK song. Doesn't really stand out like others. <br />6.She's A Rebel- Great song! Mentions Toronto, which is a total plus! (I'm from Ontario) <br />7.Extraodinary Girl- Like Give me novacaine, doesn't really stand out. <br />8.Letterbomb- vocals at the beggining are an awesome touch. Kind of reminds me of their Warning stuff. <br />9.Wake Me Up When September Ends- BEST SONG ON THE CD. I kinda think its about September 11. <br />10.Homecoming-Doesn't really stand out, sort of like a filler <br />11.Whatsername- Amazing song!! Perfect ending to CD. <br />Overall best songs on the CD are American Idiot,Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Wake me up when September Ends and Whatsername.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Farenheit 9/11 is a funny yet emotional and eye-opening film focusing on the Bush Adminastration's connection with Saudi-Arabia and their acts before and after the September 11th attacks. It's a gripping and involved satire that digs deeper than any other film that director Michael Moore has done. With media footage and file footage about Bush and others, the film covers a veriety of subjects, including the patriot act, Bush's past oil connections and others. <br /> <br />Michael Moore does an amazing job of getting the facts to the view. Unlike his other films, Moore rarely appears on camera, letting the film clips and interviews speak for him. This let's the viewer get the full story, rather than just stare at some guy who is talking about Bush.  <br /> <br />The emotion is high in this movie. Graphic scenes of war-devastated cities in Iraq, a collection of scenes with a mother mourning over her sons death in war, and a thought provoking look at Iraq in the month leading up to America's attacks. However, there a comical parts, and the film has a satirical edge. From stealing a ice cream truck to read the patriot act to Congress or playing back a stupid remark that Bush had said. <br /> <br />This film is genius. It's sad that it did not effect the election, but it is good to know that there are people like Michael Moore out there who still feel the need to change something. The braveness in this film and the unbelievable amounts of data collected in it's entirity make it a film like no other. A film that not only is based on facts, but based on human emotions. I recommend this film to anyone who loves films. It is a masterpiece and is definately one of the best movies of 2004.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I discovered Radiohead a while back.  Probably way after everyone else.  And I was really pissed!  WHY, I asked myself, why did it take me so long?  Why had nobody turned me on to them?  Fast forward:  Having listened to all of their albums (because I gobbled them up like a bulemic with a toilet in a twinkie factory), I have found that OK Computer is not only the best album they have done, but one of the best albums ever made.  I listen to CD's all day at work, because, as we all know, radio sucks. And I have like 3 or 4 hundred CD's there.  And for some reason, I listen to this one at least twice a day.  I never seem to get tired of it.  I also like The Bends, and Hail to the Thief.  And of course, Pablo Honey.  But OK Computer keeps calling me.<br /><br />I wish there were ten stars.  But then I would have to give it eleven...
B000002P5W|5.0|For the most part, the music on \\"Axis: Bold as Love\\" sticks to the style of \\"Are You Experienced?\\" (which isn't nececarily a bad thing), but there are some exceptions.  \\"Little Miss Lover\\", for example takes a big step from any previous work, to newer, harder, edgier grounds.  Meanwhile, \\"Bold as Love\\" takes a step in the oppisite direction, trying to tug at your feelings by singing this song with emotion (Which is never done on \\"Are You Experienced?\\").  Another masterpiece on this album is the so-called song, \\"EXP\\", this takes \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" but rips away all relation to real music and turns it into pure instrumental creativity.  On top of this, Hendrix hasn't lost touch with the world of pop radio, making songs like \\"Spanish Castle Making\\", another one of Jimi's hard rock classics.  All in all, this album is worth-while, but only get it if you crave hendrix.  If you already have \\"Are You Experienced?\\", short on cash, and looking for a different sound from Jimi, I'd skip it.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: *****  DVD Extras: *****<br /><br />A sensitive script, intelligent direction, and phenomenal performances are the highlights of \\"In America\\".  The story centers around an Irish family - weighed down by unresolved tragedy - who illegally immigrates to America with very little going for them except their hopes for a better future.  They settle into a decrepit building in the brutal Hell's Kitchen area of New York City where their lives become entwined with one of their neighbors, a dying artist who has already discovered within himself some of the healing they are seeking in their own lives.<br /><br />Such material might easily become maudlin in the wrong hands, but co-writer and director Jim Sheridan (who based the story on incidents from his own life) keeps a tight and tasteful rein on the tale as it unfolds, never letting it drift into inappropriate sentimentality.  Proof of his skill is to be found in the Original Ending, which is included among the selection of deleted scenes.  The original ending was marred by a certain lack of emotional restraint; the revised scene is much more reserved, more in keeping with the mood of the film as a whole ... and infinitely more satisfying.<br /><br />Sheridan's achievements with the pen and behind the camera are enhanced by a quintet of remarkable performances.  Oscar nominees Samantha Morton and Djimon Hounsou are flawless in bringing to life the characters of the mother and the ailing neighbor ... but in truth, Paddy Considine as the father and real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger are just as perfect in their respective roles as the father and the two young daughters.  \\"In America\\" is truly an ensemble acting piece, and Sheridan's casting director could not have done a better job. This an unusually honest, provocative and touching film that deserves the widest possible audience.  \\"In America\\" is a true winner.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Following the 'reviews' of my brother and parents, they strongly disliked this movie. But I wanted to watch it since Kate Winslet is my favorite actress. At first I was cautious, but the movie started to evolve into a great quirky love story, and at first you might be a little confused, but everything falls into place in the end. And to the reviewer who shut the movie off 30 minutes into it, you missed everything! You can't just turn off a movie like this! It made me feel like I was in the memories with them, since they are just like dreams.  Don't pass this one up, and especially don't shut it off until it's over, because you'll have missed out!!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I am not that new to Nightwish.  I own Oceanborn, Wishmaster, and Century Child.  I have listened to them and loved them from the start.  Tarja's voice has been the very manifestation of my soul in this world of conflicting shadows.  Marco has been my voice in this planet of cruelty.  I have listened to Nightwish grow and become the greatest group of all time, at least in my opinion.  Once is the compilation of all the years they have spent playing music, and Tuomas has proven his proficiency at playing the keyboard and writing their music and lyrics.  Nemo is my absolute favorite song on the whole album.  Although in truth I could no more choose a favorite track on the cd than a favorite star in the heavens, Nemo is my favorite.  To anybody that has never heard Nightwish, my sympathies go out to you.  Blessed Be
B000002UAX|5.0|To follow up, Sgt. Pepper, which put the emphasis on the entire album, and if you choose to count it, Magical Mystery Tour, which put the emphasis on storyline, the beatles put out the white which put emphasis on individual songs.  This might have been an effort to show versatility, or the inability of the bandmemers to sit with each other long enough to think through an album.  However it happened, this album is as good as ever.  Paul produces the well-known classics like \\"Back in the U.S.S.R\\" and \\"Ob-Lah-Dee, Ob-Lah-Da\\" and undiscovered nuggets like \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Birthday\\".  Meanwhile John shines with \\"Blackbird\\", an honest, acoustic triumph, and my personal favorite from the album.  Meanwhile, George gives forth his efforts with \\"Piggies\\", a great blugrass inspired song and shines with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", an awesome song that takes second place to blackbird as best song on the album.  Now, to show that this is an all four member inspired album, ringo makes his debut with good night. If you only have 1 Beatles album (Including Greatest hits), this would be the best choice.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I haven't been a huge Green Day fan up to this point in my life but AMERICAN IDIOT caught my ear and changed my view of the band and their musicianship.  <br /> <br />This album not only rocks all the way through but flows from song to song. I would have to say that AMERICAN IDIOT is the album of the year for 2004. I believe that years down the road it will be looked at as Green Day's masterpiece! <br /> <br />Get this album! <br /> <br />
B000031XCR|4.0|Includes some of her most well known songs.  \\"Power Of Love\\" and \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" are my favorites on this album.  However,  \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\"  should have been included.
0312995423|1.0|First off, my paperback copy of this book says copyright 1998, so I was prepared for a little \\"license\\" in terms of computing technology. But in 1998 the Internet was already huge and most corporations had high-speed internet access.  Not, for example, hundreds of low-speed ISDN line ties to a single \\"freon cooled\\" supercomputer that, oh by the way, you can't simply power off.  Even after the \\"generators\\", which happen to be in the room WITH the computer, are shorted out when somebody falls off a catwalk and into them, the mammoth computer continues to run. As if that's not bad enough, this supercomputer is attached to a file network (cleverly called a data bank in the book) that holds all of the NSA's most secret data, is wisely attached to the Internet, and also can't be turned off.  Oh, and apparently there are no backups of anything enywhere.  So from a technology perspective, this book reads much more like it was written in, maybe, the early 1980s and Mr. Brown thought he would throw in some  \\"eighties futurama\\" items into the mix to make it more interesting.  The trouble is very little of it would have made sense even then and very little of it is believable today.  Do not read this book if you know ANYTHING about computers, computer security or cryptography.  It will only exhasperate you.   <br />Oh.  Plot?  Hmm.   Well.  It is sort of a \\"find the key before bad things happen\\" plot, except after a mind-numbing chase in Spain, they find the key and, oops, bad things happen anyway.    <br />I found myself just hoping it would end!   <br />Character development?  How about a senior system administrator (Brown calls them \\"sys-secs\\" to imply they are security savvy) named Jabba because he looks and acts like Jabba the Hut from Star Wars.  And this guy Jabba, on several occasions, swears at and talks back to the head of the NSA.  Sure.  No need to be politically correct talking to the head of the NSA!   <br />I am really looking for a current book I can recommend to people looking for a good, believable, techno-thriller.  This is absolutely NOT IT!   Even recent lackluster works by Tom Clancy, or even Clive Cussler (and his ghost writers) are more believable and entertaining than this.
B000002JS6|5.0|shortly after the death of lead singer bon scott, AC/DC made the couragious move to hire a new lead singer and record this tribute album. \\"Hell's Bell\\", the albums opener tells how they're still thinking of bon, by it's words and music.  \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" and \\"Have a drink on Me\\" look at the death of bon.  The title track is definwtly the boldest song, saying that they're still rockin', desoit bon's death.  On top of the tribute aspect, this great hard rock.  It delivers that trademark AC/DC beefed up guitar sound on every song.  It's song's range from the radio friendly, energetic \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" to the bluesy, laid back \\"Rock'n'Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", but the real masterpiece of this album is \\"Back in Black\\".  The opening guitar is classic and the whole song just rocks.  To sum it all up, any rock fan needs this album. It's a must have landmark in hard rock.
B000067FP7|4.0|Gremlins is the funny story of a young man named Billy whose inventor father gives him a small, furry, adorible critter called a mogwai.

0792833236|5.0|This is the best boxing movie.  It has the most intense fight scenes.  The story line is also very powerful.  I also recomend the book of the same name.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I bought this album several years ago and still listen to it on a regular basis, unlike most of my purchases. For those wanting a primer on punk, this is not for you: at this point, the Clash left much of the punk sound behind them. But for an intro to the Clash, you couldn't do better. There is the anger and despair of the title song, and the punk adrenaline fueling such songs as Brand New Cadillac and Death or Glory. But, hey, these guys can have fun, too--just listen to Rudy Can't Fail, Jimmy Jazz, and Revolution Rock. And, of course, there is always the leftist political sensibility. <br /> <br />I've always liked Joe Strummer's singing (if that's what you call it), but it's not for everyone. You don't always understand what he is saying, and I can't help feeling that his lyrical abilities were wasted on his voice. However, he packs enough punch into these songs to compensate for any unintelligibility as in The Right Profile(is he seizing towards the end of this song?). And, let's face it, noone else's voice can cover these songs and do them half of the justice. <br /> <br />Another added bonus: Guns of Brixton. I can't say I know how Arnold Schwarzenegger sings, but I imagine its similar to Paul Simonin here. <br /> <br />Disappointments? I don't get the hub-bub about Spanish Bombs, Lost in the Supermarket, and Train in Vain. These songs are more polished and more commercial, but they lack the verve that makes the rest of this album work. <br />
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is album is amazing. Each song is very distinctive, and as a recording it has an truly unique raw, warm sound. This album truly represents a creative peak for the band, in my opinion. While not quite as dark as Vitalogy, which was comprised mostly of Vedder's songs, this album is a bit wierder and more diverse sounding. Also,  <br />if you've only listened to Peral Jam's early stuff, this album is worth listening to just for Jack Irons, who really opened up their sound. Although their currently with one of the best drummers on the planet, Matt Cameron, Jack came along and with him they made their best music (No Code and Yield). Buy this album no matter what-- it's incredible.
B00008J4P5|5.0|They are, along with The Strokes, the saviours of rock and roll!!!  And Elephant is without question the greatest of all White Stripes albums.  Not a weak song to be heard and when the music finally stops you are breathless and pleading for more!  For those of you who don't get it go back to the Velvet Underground and work your way up through The Stooges, Modern Lovers, Television, Patti Smith, etc etc.  Then it will all fall into place.  Rock and roll at it's absolute best.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This stuff is amazing.  I have not been this fired up about a band since I first heard Opeth and Devin Townsend.  I especially love Track 5 (pay special attention to the bass and drums).   <br /> <br />It is difficult not to make comparisons to Radiohead because of the similarities of the lead singers' voices, however, the overall mood of the album is very unique.  If you like Radiohead's kind of stuff, but tend to prefer music that's a bit heavier, then you might love this band.  To me, the music on this album is defintely not intended to be played as backgound music, it demands the listerner's attention.  Play it at the high volume it deserves. <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Brilliant CD well worth a place in anyones CD collection, this album has it all, fun up beat songs to moving ballads. Buying it on amazon is amazing value! Its worth WAY more.
B0002OERI0|5.0|they are back with their energy and American Idiot will no doubt be one of the best ablum of the year, the quality of the song is excellent, they show the world how perfect a song with 3 chords can be, melody-wise and arrangement-wise, we already heard their 1st single \\"American Idiot\\", and i'm sure this song, and even the whole ablum, will be a masterpiece of all time!! (i mean musically....) <br /> <br />i'm not a big fan of Greenday, indeed, i just heard them on and off from the radio and MTV thru out the years, but this album turn my head, i listen to it everyday and still enjoy it very much...... i'd give them 2 more stars if i can.  <br /> <br />Nevermind the political side of the album, i am not into that neither, just don't let that kind of thing turn your back...
B00004BZ0N|2.0|Five simply stunning songs (London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful and The Guns of Brixton) and one good one (Koka Kola) and the rest you can keep.  Not the defining punk rock moment we are lead to believe but maybe if it was a single album (it was a double vinyl release) it could have been a worthy classic.  The cover, however, is a classic from the Elvis reference to the pure rock and roll pose.  Shame about the music.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think \\"Under My Skin\\" is one of the best albums of 2004. The follow-up of her first album \\"Let Go\\" is definetely getting more matured and more romantic. I have to say that the best songs from this album are: \\"How Does It Feel\\", \\"My Happy Ending\\", and also \\"Nobody's Home\\". \\"How Does It Feel\\" was co-produced by Chantal Kreviazuk & Raine Maida, and I think that song is just so perfect. Buy this album and you won't regret it! I have listened to this album for so many times.
B000089RVX|4.0|I normally like music that you can rock out to, like Slipknot, Linkin Park, and Eighteen Visions, but Evanescence is definatly one of my top 5 favorite bands. Amy Lee has a great voice, and she doesn't lip-sync like Ashlee Simpson (god  i f***ing hate her..) All of the songs are great, but they are all pretty similar. I really didn't like that they put 2 my immortals on the album, one is live or something i think, but they both sound exactly the same. <br /> <br />Also, if you are someone who isn't really relegious, but you're parents are making you take confirmation, this was the one CD that my pastor would let me listen to in confirmation. haha.... <br /> <br />Okay  im starting to ramble, but this is a very good cd. I didn't buy it, i burned it, and im not so sure i would pay money to buy this, but im very glad i burned it.
B0006213WG|3.0|after \\"All Killer No Filler\\" and \\"Does This Look Infected\\", they proved they are technically great and have good songwriting skill, but we have to admit that things seems repeating on \\"Chuck\\", they do have some new ideas in their arrangement, and show more of their Metallica-ish impact thru out the ablum, i mean, if you like those blazing beats and breaks that you like on \\"All Kiler\\" and \\"Infected\\", you will want to give this album a listen, or if you want something really surpriseingly new and innovative, maybe not this time..
B000002KIE|5.0|12 songs, 38 minutes and 27 seconds and Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, hippies, prog rock and all self indulgent, self centred tedious 'rockers' of the 70s were justly dismissed as meaningles old farts and replaced with this - Rock and Roll!  They were downed much like the Berlin wall and with them went 20 minute guitar solos and drum solos and it was great.  The most significant single moment in the history of the greatest musical form in all history (rock and roll, folks, rock and roll) apart from Elvis recording 'That's Alright Mama'(of course).  Thrash, bash, crash, demonic stare, anger, sarcasum, and energy to burn.  A piece of history everybody should own.

Guy does a phenomenal job of giving candid advice of what to do and what NOT to do to bootstrap your start-up.  It's a must read at any level in any organization on how to use your creativity to expand your job, your company, your community, your passion for giving meaning to the world.

0140277447|3.0|This book has brought to the popular Western attention a subject that has been highly politicized in the East for decades. Iris Chang said that she wrote the book \\"out of rage\\" -- and I think the book shows it. I am deeply saddened by the news of her unexpected death. There is something deeply sad about this all.    To make yourself informed of the state of the historical research on the Nanking Incident, and of the place of Chang's book within it, I recommend you to read the article \\"The Nanjing Incident: Recent Research and Trends\\" by David Askew, Associate Professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. You can read it on the Web.     I quote from Askew (If you are interested in this subject, find and read the whole article):    Although the research in Japanese remains superior to that in English and Chinese, this was not always the case. Ironically, perhaps, much of the primary material on Nanjing was originally written and published in English. The two central collections of primary materials consist of works published in English very soon after the incident itself: H. J. Timperley ed. (1938), What War Means: The Japanese Terror in China. A Documentary Record, and Hs Shuhsi ed. (1939), Documents of the Nanking Safety Zone (this second work has been reprinted in Brook ed. 1999). This head-start has not however been maintained. The first major monograph on Nanjing to be published in English after Hs was the problematic work by Iris Chang (1997), The Rape of Nanking, a work that can only be described as frequently fabricated and/or fictitious. Following the publication of Chang, historians have at last started to write in English about this important event in Sino-Japanese history. Joshua A. Fogel ed. (2000), The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography, is by any standards an impressive work (albeit one that focuses on the historiography rather than the history of Nanjing). Although flawed, both Honda Katsuichi (1999), The Nanjing Massacre: A JapaneseJournalist Confronts Japan's National Shame, and Hua-ling Hu (2000), American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin, are important contributions. The latest in the long run of recent publications in English includes Masahiro Yamamoto (2000), Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity, a work that is easily the most objective historical account of Nanjing in the English-language literature to date.

B000000OQF|1.0|G n' R are an 80s hard rock band who want so much to be Led Zepplin.  The problems are, firstly, there is no such thing as a good hard rock band from the 80s (in fact one could argue that there is no such thing as a good 80's band at all) and, secondly, Led Zepplin are complete and utter crap so why aspire to be like them?  G n' R are merely posers - all hair and no talent.  The Village People of hard rock and it doesn't get any sadder than that.  AVOID!!!
0140277447|4.0|I haven't read this book yet. But I know some history about that brutal killing done by ugly Jans. Such a mean nation, such an unhornest government, such stupid and arrogant Jans who deny the history. I look down on Janpan. Honestly, I hate them deep from my chinese blood. ALso I hate them as a human being. Janpanese are arrogand outside but inside they are pathetic. History can't be forgotten by us, by our descendant.
B00008BXJG|1.0|Why do AC/DC command such respect?  They only ever wrote one song and simply changed the lyrics.  Album after album of the same old crap.  It wouldn't be so bad if it was a good song or if Bon could sing or Angus play the guitar.  Save yourself some money and stand on the cat - it sounds the same.

'New York City Cops,' 'The Modern Age,' 'Last Nite,'... in fact the whole album is simply stunning.  To be critical of this album is to admit you know nothing of what makes great rock and roll.  Perfection!
0440178002|5.0|this novel is quite possibly the best novel written after the death of sir dickens. in my mind, no author will ever surpass the genius of dickens' writing (especially bleak house. i love that one), but James Clavell has certainly come close. shogun being about as long as bleak house, the detail is just amazing. great character developement, especially when written in an age where bestsellers are pointless trashy love novels written to gain a few dollars (im exagerating here). not to the extent of 19th century english lit, but hey, hes not being paid by the word (or at least i dont think he was), so he can take the time to develop a plot-driven book with great (not amazing, but definitely worthy of the adjective great) characters. this is definitely one of those page-turners that you just can't put down, but it is deeper than that. james has a way of keeping you interested, yet a way of making the plot memorable, much like dickens except not depending on a set of circumstances (imo dickens' biggest downfall, but is easily overlooked). come to think of it, i don't think there were any EXTREMELY boring parts in this novel. some will argue that nothing happens in the beginning, which is true, but it isn't extremely boring because you are learning about japanese culture (which i already knew quite a bit about), which gives a touch of interestingness (is that a word?) that keeps you hooked. right before blackthorne gets his ship back is probably the most boring part for me because all it talks about is his secret relationship, but i got through it quickyl and with little encumbrance. <br /> <br />review in a nutshell: amazing book with good characters and plot. worthy of a read by ANYONE of any age, occupation, interests, etc. <br /> <br />READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you wont regret it...
0140277447|5.0|The details remind me of what my grandma told me of what the japanses soldiers did in china, really barbaric. raping, killing pregnant women, and then cut her open alive and take out the fetus, tie chinese in bags and drop them in deep lake, experient on kids with candies laced with germs, so on and so on. There is no deny that the japanese did the most horrific crimes during WII, much more than the germans to the jews. This account of the japanese brutality is not only shared by the east asian nations, I learned that, from the time when I visited Britain, many WII british POWs recounted their encounters in the hands of the japanese soldiers, and I still remember vividly their tearing eyes on their aged, wrinkled face. Some of them are still detest anything japanese. One time when the japanese emporer visited Britain, these formal POWs went to protest against the japanese emperor with some absolute resolve for the japanese to utter a word of appology.     And yet, the japanese failed to do so to all the nations it inflicted so much pain on, while we all remember the german conceller kneeling down in front of the polish victims, the japanese government, the japanese people, still refuse to utter a word of appology, being the nation which brutlelly invaded China and then massacred more than 10 million people. The germans killed 6 million Jews!    where ever you go in China, the hatred of ordinary Chinese towards japanese is deep rooted, almost every Chinese could tell you some of their reletives, or someone they heard of died in the hands of the japanese, including two of my relatives in North China, and one of my husband's uncle in South of China. Not any kind of properganda can make the grass root people so hating the japanese, it is what their deeds that's done it.    japanese, and yes, I mean oridinary japanese who bred those barbaric 'soldiers' are really evil people. They are still not appologizing...really amazing people! and the world lets it. Although one reason of the Chinese not telling the world the detailed attrocities commited in China by the japanese is due to the Chinese culture of shame, a shame they feel being butchered, they'd rather forget this 'shameful' period, but it does not mean that the hatred willl be gone without a heart felt appology from the japanese goveronment representing their people. And yet, the japanese just plays on this Chinese characteristics of rather forgetting the 'shameful 8 years', and having get away of paying war repatriations etc, they continously deny crimes happened. what a un-shameful nation, what a barbaric people!     I am all for stopping the cycle of hatred, but unfortunately, when it comes to the japanese, and because of their behaviour after the war, and still today with their priminister and most polititians and their whole people pay tribute to their war criminals and not appologizing, I see no end of this hatred towards japanese, and it is not only a chinese phenonmenon. ALL the nations invaded by japanese and brutalized by it, have this hatred, still today.    I hope the world come to realize and see exactly what a nation japan really is, a nation superfacially polite, but really in-humane, and really really un-civilized, more like murderers with suit and tie!

B00005V0X5|5.0|There have been some reviews of this re-release by people who obviously don't know much about WHY it was re-mastered &amp; re-mixed.  This isn't just a case of CDs sounding better than analog tape.  There are some guitar parts on this that weren't even on the original release.  Those aren't newly recorded parts either, they were recorded with the rest of the original album.  Not only that, but it sounds to me like there are alternate takes of guitar and vocal parts used here.  The way it sounds now is the way the band wanted it to sound back then, with full advantage taken of advances in sound technology.  As for the people complaining about the bleeping in &quot;These Boots&quot;, they obviously never read what Dave Mustaine wrote in the CD booklet about it.  For legal reasons, the song would have either been left off or altered the way that it has been.  For those who don't want it on the album: make a copy of the CD and leave &quot;These Boots&quot; off.

0790736039|4.0|LIKE ALL THE OTHERS....LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.... For anybody who is afraid of clowns, they should never see this movie. IT is Pennywise The Dancing Clown who eats worlds and children. The only thing that sucks is that the killings are never actually shown. The only ones brave enough to confront it are 7 kids who have hard relationships with each other after their childhood. When memories come back to them...they remember.....THERE'S SOME SAD NEWS.  {I like  Pennywise's razor-sharp teeth} The ending is a little disappointing, but the rest of the 3 hours is neat.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Wow! That's all I can say. This album is a tremendous collection of chart-topping hits. Fun, catchy, uplifting music with tongue-in-cheek and in-your-face lyrics combined with heartfelt beautiful ballads. All delivered by Shania Twain's warm, distinctive voice. A real showcase of an amazing carrier. <br />And as a collection a wonderful gift and a must have for people who like feel-good music, beatiful love songs and moving melodies. <br /> <br />
B0002G2B2M|1.0|I wasn't exactly sure what to make of this film at first. It was so boring and never made any sense at all. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't know why anyone likes this. It wasn't funny, and it wasn't interesting, and I found that my personality can be decieving and I'm sometimes like Joel Barish, even though I don't like this movie, {but I like the actors in other films}, but if you're like me, ESSM is not worth seeing more than once if you don't like movies that don't make any sense. Like me.
0452282152|1.0|This book presents nothing to keep a listener interested: no intrigue, no mystery, no PLOT, no character development. I must've trudged through 7/8 of the story, and then I was sidetracked by something more urgent. Two days later, I could not care less what would happen in the story and so I have not finished it. (I lasted through 7/8 from mild curiosity, and I was on a cruise with a lot of time for just listening as the oceans sailed by.)

0140277447|3.0|Especially to Chinese people, <br /> <br />As a Japanese, I am in a deep shock after reading so many extremely offensive comments against \\"general\\" Japanese.  <br /> <br />Have these people who hate Japanese witnessed the holocaust by themselves? Do they at least have a connection to the victims? Do they hate any Japanese people in front of them even if they have nothing to do with the war?  <br /> <br />Do they know that this unfounded hatred against a specific race is nothing but racism and nothing different from what the Japanese soldiers used for an excuse to kill Chinese people in those days? <br /> <br />I would not argue the credability of the content of this book nor agree with the Japanese government's attitude to the history problems. <br /> <br />The only thing I can say is that we have to stop the cycle of hatred. The hatred does not make us move forward. All these offensive comments reminded me of my terrible memories with some of my Chinese friends, at least thost who I believed are my friends.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella did a fairly effective job in his portrayal depicting the ravages of the Civil War in his slightly overdrawn \\"Cold Mountain\\".  The battle scenes replete with thousands of extras and the overall theme of the movie gave it a poor man's Gone With the Wind feel.<br /><br />The gifted and classically beautiful Nicole Kidman plays the genteel Ada Monroe a Charleston native who is transplanted to idyllic Cold Mountain, N.C. with her reverend father Donald Sutherland on the eve of the commencement of the Civil War.  An interaction with local lad Inman played by Jude Law leads to a brief platonic romantic interlude as he marches off to war.  She implores him to come back to her and he vows to do so.<br /><br />The naive enthusiasm of the Southern boys for war soon leads to the ravages of bloody battle.  Law suffers through wounds and battles and decides to desert and return home.  Meanwhile back in Cold Mountain, with the slaves emancipated, the farms are not being tended and people are starving.  Kidman, whose father has passed away is ill equipped to fend for herself.  She is rescued by a very effective Renee Zellweger playing the down home country girl Ruby Thewes who comes to live with her and together they forge a hardscrabblelife together on Kidman's farm.<br /><br />All the while, Law encounters the horrors of war on his journey back home.  He encounters drifting deserters, fatherless children, marauding soldiers and a society destroyed.  He interacts with both Natalie Portman and personal fave Giovanni Ribisi on his trek who both give good performances in a supporting role to the story.<br /><br />His journey finally brings him back to Kidman and Cold Mountain where he finds that things have changed rather dramatically.<br /><br />The film does a nice job in representing the turmoil and hardship creatied by this unfortunate chapter of U.S. history and the lives destroyed as a result of it.
B00005JMYI|4.0|Who ever thought that cologne, macho-men, and punting dogs off bridges could be so hilarious?! <br /> <br />Many people have told me to pass this one up, but once I saw it, I have to say that the funny parts are enough to override the stupid/lame parts, which were, essentially, few. <br /> <br />It seems that after a few flops, Will Ferrell has found his niche among the tacky '80s \\"newsculture\\" where fighting for an anchoring position over a woman is absolutely unheard of. Ferrell plays a smooth-talking, manly anchorman for the top-rated newsstation on network TV. When he discovers that his position is in jeopardy, he realizes that he must fight for what he loves: poetry, long walks on the beach, and his dog, Baxter. <br /> <br />This joyous and often absurd romp through Pleasureland and beyond had me laughing at the many celebrity cameos and crazy plot twists. But you have to admit, that \\"Anchorman\\"'s quotability is close to that of \\"Zoolander,\\" with incredible lines like, \\"You just punted Baxter off the bridge!\\" You just need to see it to believe it! <br /> <br />Anyway, I give it four stars since it kept me laughing through its absurdity...
6305841861|1.0|I hope you'll excuse me for interupting all this fan club drivel with an actual critical review, but this is a horrible movie. Just like most every other movie that has tried to be a horror and a comedy at the same time - it ends up being neither. Although I chuckled a few times, and, I will admit the gore effects were cool at times, since this is primarily supposed to be a horror film, I must point out that there is not a single scary moment in this entire film. I'm sorry but there is just nothing interesting about a severed hand giving it's former owner the middle finger. It's not scary and it's not funny. It's just plain stupid. I mention that scene because it's the perfect metaphor for the entire movie: not scary, not funny, just really stupid.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I am a huge fan of everything Bridget Jones. I've read the books and love the movie. So imagine how elated I was when I discovered that a sequel film was in the making!    Today, \\"Bridget Jones's Diary: The Edge of Reason\\" opened in Portland, and of course, I was there to see it.    Bridget has definitely grown up a bit [...]. However, the film is consistent in Bridget's awkward moments and physical humor. But this film deals more with what happens when we finally get the relationship we've dreamed of.    Mark Dary (Firth) is the perfect boyfriend. But what happens when the honeymoon is over? The workaholic lawyer spends more time at work and with sexy Rebecca, leaving Bridget out in the rain (literally!). Bridget's fears get the best of her, and to make a long story short, gets stuck in a Thai prison...    The cinematography is consistent with the predecessor, and it is ofen enjoyable to hear Bridget's inner dialogue. I felt that the acting was actually significantly better than the last, too, especially considering the improvement of Renee Zellweger's British accent. And props to her for gaining weight to fill the role!    Overall, this romantic comedy was touching as well as funny. I give it four stars and recommend it to any Bridget fans!

0784011176|5.0|This film shows how music can become the strongest side of a personality when a woman who cannot talk expresses herself on the keys of a piano : she plays music to live inside herself and to be in harmony with the world and particularly her daughter. Married from a distance by her family to an unknown man, she finds he is absolutely negative about the piano, her piano, that will stay on the beach. But a neighbor will get the piano, let her play, though his attraction and interest is obviously sexual. She will yield to his desire because the piano, the music are bridges between them. This will lead to a drama, a mutilation, a separation, an elopement, the drowning of the piano, the near drowning of the woman, and a better future in spite of a prosthesis to compensate for the mutilation. She has met the man she loves and that love came from her music and her piano. As such the film is rather naive and simple. What makes it a great film is that it is situated in New Zealand, though the woman's family is English. Two other levels of characterization of the husband intervene in this situation. First his gross and unrespectful treatment of the local population, the Maoris. He more or less exploits them, he does not try to speak their language, he does not try to have any contact with them, except when he needs them to work for him. The second element is his conception of his farm : he does not take into account the local resistance at his opening some land for his farm because that land is an ancient and traditional burying area for the local population. He refuses to take that into account and he does what he wants, and only what he wants. In other words he is a born dominator and has not heard of the ecocultural dimension of life : it is true he lives at the beginning of the colonization of New Zealand and his attitude is that of a colonial settler. And moreover he is unable to cope with his wife, to understand her desire and need of her piano, and then to make himself be desired and loved, even in spite of her attempts. It is this slow and precise description of the main characters of the film and their relations to the local population that makes the film interesting, not to speak of the acting which is excellent, and has to be so in those constantly refrained and dominated feelings that are at stake.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUbe desired and loved, even in spite of her attempts.

B00004U8P9|5.0|Too weird for some. Not weird enough for others. The truth is that this is a totally unique, extraordinary amalgam of many different genres, melded together to make something original which will not be equalled, let alone bettered. Like all great works it actually improves with age, and with repeated viewings. Although I'd noticed, and puzzled over, the late-night queues for it in London's Chelsea for some months before, I saw it first with a live and lively participating audience in New York's Village, round about 1985. It was not a forgettable experience, although I admit to being bewildered most of the time. I bought the DVD about 18 months ago, watched it then, and have just watched it again. Many things come to notice with these repeat viewings. The writing is subtle, and deep. It's the kind of thing that a writer produces once in his life, and then cannot do again. It brings together so many strands of observation and experience, and expresses them, perfectly, in the idiom of the Zeitgeist. That makes it timeless, or, in other words, one for the time capsule. It doesn't date, because it is already dated. The performances are superb: Curry is just fan-bloody-tastic. He's even better than Mick Jagger at doing that thing. All the other characters are exactly right. Who knows what the film draws on: I seemed to see a quote from \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" in the boy and girl in the churchyard. American Gothic/European Gothic --- all the way from the 18th century. It's like the Marquis de Sade on a milkshake, and infinitely more entertaining. One thing: in the first showing that I saw I thought I remembered Charles Gray shaking a fishnet leg with the best of rest of them, but this scene didn't appear in the DVD (I have the 2 disc version). Have I just dreamt it, or was something cut?
B0002IU988|4.0|If you're a hardcore Creed fan, you probably won't want to hear what I have to say here. But the thing is, aside from a different lead singer (in this case, Myles Kennedy), there really is no difference between this album, One Day Remains, and a Creed album; after all, the rest of the band consists of all the same people. And listening to this album shows that the guys still shine as usual.<br /><br />There are plenty of songs on here that would satisfy any rock enthusiast, whether it be pulsating songs like \\"Open Your Eyes\\" or mellow songs like \\"Broken Wings\\" (no, that's NOT a Mr. Mister remake). Other standouts include the \\"The End Is Here\\", the introspective \\"Shed My Skin\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Down to My Last\\".<br /><br />While things may get a little disorganized at times, like in \\"Metalingus\\", this is still a good album from Alter Bridge. Lovers of Scott Stapp may not want to like this album, but results are so exceptional that it's pretty hard not to. Pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00005JMUL|5.0|I highly recomend going to see this film.  The story is fantastic, the animation is astounding, and the plot \\"though simplistic in nature\\" is great. <br />   When viewing Polar Express I noticed how the \\"many\\" adults enjoyed the movie just as well as the children did. Hot Chocolate was one of my favorite musical number.  I had to go see this movie again.  When my wife returnes to town she want's to see it and I will go to.   <br />   I highly recomend this film.  If I could rate this film it would be a 6 on Amazons scale.  MOST EXCELLENT !!!
B0000067L4|4.0|This fourth and final album to be issued--in January 1969--during Cream's two-and-a-half year career is probably their most consistent, and among their best. At six songs in just over thirty minutes, it's short, and for anyone awaiting a major final statement in 1969 it must have been a bringdown. But looking at the group's work 35 years later, it is by far their tightest album, with nary a weak cut. <br />   \\"Fresh Cream\\" (December 1966 - the US version issued early in 1967 is superior)was Cream heavying up the blues. Some of Clapton's most blistering guitar can be found on this mix of originals (by Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker) and blues covers. The best version on CD is DCC's gold disc, combining the UK only track (\\"Spoonful\\") with the US only track (the classic \\"I Feel Free\\") and adding both sides of Cream's debut single (\\"Coffee Song\\"/\\"Wrapping Paper\\"), all nicely annotated. \\"Disreali Gears\\" lacks the sonic impact of the debut, but shows Cream's progress away from blues derivations to a more integrated sound: fine pop hooks adorn blues/psych originals. Clapton is more subdued as a guitarist, but makes his presence felt as both vocalist and (for the first time) songwriter, and there are more varied tonal colors and moods, from the proto-Zep mythology of \\"Brave Ulysses\\" to the haunting, downcast \\"We're Going Wrong.\\" Much of the progress is due to new producer/multi-instumentalist (and virtual fourth member) Felix Pappalardi, who had produced Fred Neil and the Youngbloods, and would go on to found Mountain in 1969. <br />    The # 1 smash double album \\"Wheels Of Fire,\\" was yet another step forward, with Bruce, Baker and Pappalardi adding trumpets,tubular bells, tonettes, cellos, and violas to the mix of two covers (Albert King and Howlin' Wolf) and seven fine originals (including perhaps Ginger Baker's finest contributions to the group--\\"Passing the Time\\" is worthy of John Cale, and fans should hear the near-six minute version first issued by DCC). The second, live, disc shows that,however far they had grown in the studio they had become amazingly self indulgent on stage. (No doubt these aimless jams sounded fresher in 1968). Of the four mostly long tracks, only the Clapton-sung \\"Crossroads\\" captured the fire of live Cream at its best. The other three live tracks, adding up to 40 minutes, are really the worst Cream on record. (Again, the DCC gold version, reproducing the original silver-foil cover and adding Clapton's only original song from these sessions, \\"Anyone For Tennis,\\" is the way to go if you can afford a copy). <br />     Cream broke up in December 1968, and \\"Goodbye\\" is its farewell (though a 'Best Of' and two volumes of \\"Live Cream\\" would follow). The three live tracks are loose and full of fire (especially the classic nine-minute \\"I'm So Glad\\"), recorded near the end, in October 1968. Clapton's guitar is blistering, but the trio maintains focus and these killer tracks beat the live disc on \\"Wheels of Fire\\" hands down.  <br />     The three studio tracks show the continuing growth of the band (with Pappalardi once again playing and producing throughout). This is not the sound of the famed power trio, but a creative studio collaborative. Each member contributes a gem: Clapton's \\"Badge\\" (with George Harrison) is one of his greatest achievements. Bruce plays piano (and Pappalardi, mellotron) on Jack's delightfully whimsical \\"Doing That Scrapyard Thing,\\" which, like \\"Badge\\" is more reminiscent of the Beatles or Traffic than anything on the first two Cream albums. Ginger Baker's track, typically mordant and surreal(he was, after all, both the oldest member and in the midst of a lengthy period of opiate addiction)\\"What A Bringdown,\\" is terrific: driving and jazzy, a four minute antecedent to Blind Faith's \\"Do What You Like,\\" with Bruce on keyboards and Pappalardi playing bass! <br />     \\"Goodbye\\" was no grand final statement - thank god! - but a fleet, near flawless minor classic that has aged better than some of the group's more famous work. If you can find it, check out Mobile Fidelity's killer transfer (now out of print).
1563890119|4.0|What I meant by the title of this review is simple:<br /><br />You are either going to like this book or you're going to dislike this book.....there is NO inbetween here!<br /><br />Anyway, back to my review. I have almost finished reading this book. I'm more than half way done, and I think I can form a valid opinion of this book as well as anyone who has read the entire book.<br /><br />That being said, Preludes and Nocturnes' story revolves around Morpheus (aka the Sandman or Dream). Morpheus is a being called an Endless. He was once the ruler of the dream world until he was captured by a religious cult, which had all thought they captured one of his sisters, Death.<br /><br />Sound confusing, well.....it gets better. Morpheus was imprisioned for an entire human lifetime, which is roughly 60 or 70 years. This imprisionment also has caused thousands of people to either die from staying awake or die by being in an eternal slumber. He finally finds a way out and escapes. The people who were asleep have finally awaken, but what Morpheus doesn't realize is that everything in his world has changed. He also realizes that he has to find his tools that gave him power, so he can get things back in order. The main storyline is the quest Morpheus goes on to get his tools back.<br /><br />This is a very complex storyline, but it's great fun to read, and is really unlike any comic book you'll ever read. This book has sparked enough interest for me to buy two more books, and that doesn't happen too often. I once thought that nobody could come close to what Alan Moore did with \\"The Watchmen\\" or even what Frank Miller did with \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,\\" but I'm starting slowly realize that this Sandman series is coming pretty close.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is my all time favorite movie. The first few times i saw it, i cried at the end. It's a little slow at one or two scenes, but it's such a great movie. It had a few little funny scenes, but was more a dramatic fantasy film. It's made of a lot of little stories, that all connect with each other. It's more for adults, because if you don't listen carefully, it can be kind of confusing.
068987474X|5.0|This book is great!  I read it in two sittings it was so good.  It is short, sweet, to the point, and absolutely right on.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Chris Doyle, Aussie expat who calls Asia home and whom you may know as the cinematographer behind \\"Hero\\", had this to say about Lost in Translation: \\"the 'dirtiest' - ethically speaking - film I have had the misfortune to see\\" and after seeing it I'd have to agree with him.  <br /> <br />You know there's something wrong when the movie's idea of funny is when people of a certain nationality has trouble pronouncing foreign words accurately. <br /> <br />Picture this: it's an American kid's first day at a Japanese school. His family has just migrated to Japan. Obviously, he has trouble with the language. So, all the other high school kids start laughing at this. Him: Nar-nar-kar-wa. They: No, no - Nanakawa! Hahahha!\\" So he goes - why are they laughing at me? Is it my fault? Eventually he gets severely depressed and perhaps psychologically scarred. Not so funny now is it. <br /> <br />Maybe it's just me though. I know if I saw any other American movie which made a laughing point out of someone's handicapp, say, a superhero's sidekick in a wheelchair, I'd have thought that's pretty bad taste.

Set in gay Paris, but using songs from all eras and all types.  Reworking tunes from Madonna to Sting, from Marilyn Monroe to Joe Cocker and setting it in time period costumes and lavish production numbers, this IS a feast for the eyes and ears.  It is fabulous.  Almost beyond description.  Could grow into a cult classic.  Nicole Kidman DESERVED an Oscar for this role.  She sings!  She dances!  She has an illness that could kill her!  Ewan McGregor, in a star Turning performance is believable singing and dancing to show his love for Nic.  Its all about love, the impossible love you root for.  Nic & Ewan make a great couple on screen, with red hot chemistry.  Fast and furious direction keep the film moving along nicely.  If you want something different that is full of life and energy, this is a great way to sing two hours away.
B000007R1M|5.0|This is great stuff. I found this album at a thrift store on cassete, and literally wore it out. Very interesting music, almost creates a trance like feel when your driving.

Warner Bros turned it down as too good for a flip side single. The song was \\"Handle with Care\\" <br />Being turned down and after being together for a while the five decided to form their own band using a name that would not give away their actual identies) The Traveling Wilburys was formed, remember Bob Dylan was with Columbia Records, Petty was with MCA Records etc. So they had to keep everything a secret until George Harrison went ot MCA, Columbia etc to get their permission for all the band members to sing on an album that was not their own Label. Once they got the legal OK, they were off and running with promos, videos and then the release of Vol 1. <br />A hit over night, but in December 1988 a month after the release of the album, Roy Orbison died of a massive Heart Attack. <br />The band regrouped and in 1990 they release their 2nd and last album called Vol 3 (Vol 2 was skipped over in memory of Roy) All Vol 2's are actually  Tom Pettys \\"Full Moon Fever\\" 1990 release song for song, which is regarded as the Wilburys 2nd release that never was since most of the Wilburys sang on his Album. <br />Imports also refer to this as Vol 2 but it is still Pettys \\"Full Moon Fever\\".  <br />Roy only had time to appear in one Video promo \\"Handle with Care\\" the others have the four original members and Roys guitar in a chair to affect the \\"Missing man formation\\" for muscians. <br />Other performers that had a part in the Wilburys, but got very little credit were Eric Clapton, Del Shannon, Ringo Starr and K D Lang appeared in the Studio to do a duet with Roy on 'Crying\\" shortley before Vol 1 was finished and on the same recording studio. <br />Roys 1990 release album that was not completed because of his death called \\"Mystery Girl\\" featured the Wilburys on \\"You Got It\\" which Roy never lived to see released. <br />After George Harrison death the Wilburys met with Legal problems concerning who was in charge of the original tapes and rights. Cynthia Harrison finally got control and that where it ended. At least until Barbara Orbison and Cynthia Harrison met in April 2004 to discuss some \\"Possibilities\\".
B00005JMUL|5.0|I found it quite distrating and confusing that the only two negative reviews to date were written by people who haven't even seen Polar Express!  I take people's review's seriously and don't need to waste my time by reading jibberish based on blind assumptions.  You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover or a movie by it's trailer. These are movie reviews, not trailer reviews.  Thank you.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I wrote a review titled \\"Entertaining\\" a short while ago (see below) praising Shrek while saying that the Donkey was annoying. Seeing it again I can now appreciate the humour of the character more, I suppose he's too frenetic at first impression.  <br /> <br />And I say again that the \\"adult\\" content is very mild, and much worse is watched by kids on TV every day. And poot humour is something that all kids find funny, like it or not. But I still think the film is too short! <br /> <br />BTW the Shrek DVD I managed to obtain had an added 15 minute 3D section in an extra disc. If you liked the original you'll love Shrek in 3D!
B0002MB7QW|4.0|I bought this movie and couldn't finish seeing it because it was scratched but the first hour had me on the edge of my seat.  I kept squirming and wanting more.  What fascinated me about this film is how the director brings the end of this ice age and the beginning of a relationship between father and son.  They say that tragedy sometimes breaks up families but what happens when a family is already broken up, they are reunited.  Hurray!  I loved it!!!!!!!
0140277447|4.0|I borrowed Irish Chang's book The Rape of Nanking from a local library to read exactly five years ago. I read fiction horror stories, but none of the stories left indelible chill in the spine like The Rape of Nanking did. It left me mortified and shaken unlike any book I've ever read. <br /> <br />A true horror story that's rare in disturbing the reader to maximum effect, and I have read the Marquis de Sade's novels such as The 120 Days of Sodom. De Sade expounded philosophy in human behavior and psychology (a century before Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud) in the context of fiction. Sade's ironic and misanthropic perspective of humankind in its able reign to commit barbarous cruelty embody truth in realization by the worst beasts in us all when being stripped of civilization and subject to deprivation in human dignity. What deprive us make us stronger tyrants. <br /> <br />A one star is deducted because of Chang's emotive appeal towards the end, not to mention questionable accuracy. I have no doubt the Nanking incident happened, but the number of the inhumanely murdered remain a question. Moral outrage is understandable whenever Japanese government officials, businessmen, educators and polemicists deny Nanking incident. <br /> <br />It is an undeniable truth that what Fascist Japan did in its reign of terror on the 1/10th of the world was evil. United States implicates itself in covering up the mass-scale war crime (despite the trials and subsequent execution of the lesser convicted war criminals, they exonerated the amoral Emperor Hirohito who acknowledged and approved of expansionist conquests culminating in crimes against humanity during his rule) to assist the defeated Japan in achieving its economic and political power for the purpose of global trading.  <br /> <br />Profitable trade is a priority over human lives lost in the bath of blood and ashes decades old. Germans continue to bear the memory of pain and shame by being forced to compensate the Jewish (and other races?) victims of the Nazi conquest and subjugation. Former Imperial Japan fascists have the convenience of not only not being humilated but live prosperous lives knowing they participated in the rape, pillage and plunder of the invaded countries and get away with it without prosecution and penalty. The majority of Japanese population do not know this side of history and do not care because they want to move on instead of facing the shameful past and begin the healing process onward.  <br /> <br />A few million Filipinos perished under Imperial Japan's brutal occupation of the Phillipines, yet it remains an asterisk in official recorded history. However, the POWs can never forgive the Japanese for the cruelty and endurance they suffered and their plea for justice remain unanswered because the powers-that-be favor Japan's economic recovery over anguish of individual victims.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is music that makes me smile. Beautifully crafted electro-pop with heartfelt lyrics. Ben Gibbard's vocal stylings that uncannily resemble Ben Folds' fill in the bleeps and clicks with his sincere delivery. The ladies singing backgroud, Jen Wood and Jenny Lewis, almost steal the show. The simply sweet and charming harmony their voices offer are the perfect complement to Ben Gibbard's.   <br /> <br />Listen on the bus, in the rain, at 3:37 am. <br /> <br />My stand-outs: \\"District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" \\"Such Great Heights\\" \\"Nothing Better\\"
B0000042MY|5.0|I enjoyed the Last of the Mohicans when I first saw the movie in Theatre.  It is a powerful production; full of love, tragedy, and suspense.<br /><br />A couple of years later, a friend loaned me the tape soundtrack.  It was then that I realized the power of the film is entirely carried by the music.  Each selection will evoke the emotion of that scene.  A good soundtrack always recalls the movie and inspires the emotion.  It is an understatement that Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman created a 'good' arrangement of music.<br /><br />The unique factor for this soundtrack is that it stands on its own as a great collection of art.  The arrangement of the sound tells a powerful story that can remain seperate from the film and maintain its' appeal.  Everybody knows the soundtrack or at least has some familiarity with at least one selection from the CD.<br /><br />I recommend this CD as a great improvement from the old audio tape, as an outstanding soundtrack and as a timeless collection of relaxing and passionate music.
0140277447|5.0|This is a very good book which states an undeniable horrible crime committed by jap troops fully supported by their crazy people. they are not only without any humanity, but also coward, even afraid of face the truth, tried to deny it again and again.  but truth is truth, no one can cover it, and we will forever remember that horrible december in the mid 1930, remember all the inocent victoms. <br />
B00063F8B2|5.0|Even though my four year old wasn't ready for the entire movie, she refused to leave until the credits were over because she loved the music so much! I think this is a great soundtrack for both grownups and children- it does allow you to visualize some of the fantastic scenes in the movie with silly songs like \\"Hot Chocolate\\", yet the soundtrack also throws in some of the beloved Christmas classics for good measure. All in all, it is a great compilation that should please both children and adults alike.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I considered this movie to be a worthy follow-up to the first one. Its a very charming and undemanding movie where Bridget tries to take her relationship with Mark Darcy to the next level. The sequel proves to be just as laid back as the first movie and I enjoyed the comic talents of all three stars involves, Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Yes, Grant as back in his usual role from the first movie, trying to \\"change\\" but remaining the same wormy self.<br /><br />There are some uneven spots along the way which may distract from the overall story. A good example of this would be the subplot of Bridget's friend and her involvment with a younger man which get Bridget thrown in Thai prison where she bonded with all these Thai women who really had bad relationships; making Bridget realized how lucky she was with Mark. The entire scene, charming as it is, was bit off tangent from the general tone of the movie.<br /><br />Zellweger managed to master her English accent pretty well this time around and her perky demeanor and high spirit carried the movie pretty well. Her skills as an actress also improved as well. Both Firth and Grant provided very good support as well. Firth had more screen time then Grant this time around and Bridget's \\"friends and family\\" also got less screen time as movie worked around the relationship between Bridget and Mark. A good all around comedy that I thought to be pretty entertaining and enjoyable to watch.
B00005R87Q|2.0|Rather than just bashing this film (albeit well deserved) let me start with the good points. 'The Fast and the Furious' has good production values, cinematography, and performances. The director does a decent job at maintaining pace and the story does offer some character development. Where this movie hurts itself is: 1) Apparent lack of a technical consultant. In the first race scene, Walker's car begins spewing nuts, bolts, and washers from the dashboard (?). Apparently he has plenty of spare parts in places they should not be. In the same race he burns out his cylinders and yet is still able to outrun the police. This movie is filled with such technical flaws (I won't even mention hitting a semi head on and walking away without a scratch); 2) The good guys are a crooked cop and a thief who hijacks trucks. The bad guys are truckers who defend themselves and Asians.; 3) The film-makers should have seriously set aside their own predjudice.-- Although the technical inaccuracies frankly will not bother many at all (hey, if it's entertaining, why not), it's basic assinine concept of protagonists and it's expressed predjudice make it something I cannot recommend. There are several stellar reviews for this movie on this page that rate this movie as good to great. Just take a look at the number of copies of this DVD which are available and the cheap asking price. This should give you an indication that this is a movie you will not want to see again and that at least a few of the stellar reviews are from people wanting to get rid of their copy.-Bob
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have to agree with what one of the other reviewers said. The second movie is a vast improvement from the first and that is only because the first was severely constrained by having to introduce all the characters and lay down an infrastructure for the other two movies to follow. But that is no lying that the second one is great! There are some amazing special effects scenes and the characters are well developed and familiar by now. You also see the introduction of that scorned but piteous creature-Gollum. Also the female characters are better fleshed out- Arwen and Eowyn. <br />Like I said in my review for the Fellowship of the Ring,if you love the movie and are planning to buy it, you might as well go ahead and buy the extended edition. It is only a little more expensive than the theatrical version but far richer and more satisfying! You wont regret it.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Although Moore's efforts to get Bush out have failed so far, his film still is a refreshing picture that gives some great insights into the actions of the current USA government. On the other hand, like some other reviewers I think Moore misses out a lot of opportunities to make an even more powerful indictment. Moore makes it appear as if the main goal of the Bush government is oil and business contacts - there may be some truth in that, but this is really an all-too simplistic view. The word neoconservative is not mentioned at all - why not mention the ideology that so strongly drives this cabinet and indict it (which is easy enough), and why not say more about Bush's fundamentalist religious convictions? And on the level of actions - where are Guantanamo Bay and other cases of ignoring the Geneva Charter? These may be some of the most heinous and typical actions of the administration and provide most excellent ammunition for critics - but we do not hear about them.  <br /> <br />Instead, Moore spends a large part of the film (about the entire second part) to tell what a misfortunate idea it was to invade Iraq - sure, he's right, but we all know that (well, *many* do). There is the story of a mother who lost her son in the war, which is very moving for sure, but such stories have been in the newspapers and journals all the time. I'd rather see him offering some revealing material (as happens in the first hour) than making a documentary like anyone else does.  <br /> <br />Certainly there is a lot positive in Moore's narration about the war, too. The Orwellian quote about war was right spot-on, and if anything Moore convinces you even more that the war in Iraq was a misfortunate idea. Particularly amusing is it when he goes asking conservative Congressmen to let their sons serve in the army - of course their reactions are expectable, but one of them draws such a terrified face when he's asked this (\\"why, *my* son in the army?\\"), that he perfectly betrays his own hypocrisy. It is not the rich who sustain this war, as Moore aptly concludes, but mostly the poor ones like those from Flint, Michigan where, due to sheer disinterest of the administration, half the population is without work. Here Moore creates a great image of a government that is so rigorous in foreign policies while it cannot even sustain the situation within its own borders. The same is true for the Oregon coast, where due to budget cuts only one agent can patrol. Does the government actually care about security once the cameras are gone, you will ask yourself. And that while they constantly abuse the \\"fear factor\\" and have such laws as the Patriot Act that affect the most harmless imaginable citizens.   <br /> <br />Like many, I do have my doubts about some of the evidences Moore brings up in the first part of the movie about the Bush family's links to the Saudis and the Bin Ladens. Much of the evidence seems merely suggestive, particularly that of the oil pipeline deal in Afghanistan. It really goes a bit far to suggest, as Moore does, that Hamid Karzai was merely appointed because of his business contacts. But even if only a small part of the entire story is true (which I'm sure of) then Bush has quite something to explain. Particularly convincing is the part that narrates about the contacts of Saudi oil sheiks with companies Bush ruled (and ruined) in the 80's, and the dependence of the USA on Saudi investors - how can you act against the Saudis if they're such good friends of yours and effectively own 7% of the country? Again, there is a great hypocrisy in all this, and that is what Moore brings out so well during the entire movie. It is unfortunate that he feels the need to exaggerate things so often, since (as another reviewer aptly observed) the mere facts are saying enough. That, and Moore's reluctance to touch some of the Bush administration's most controversial actions keep this from being a 5-star film.  <br /> <br />Finally, it seems to have become fashion to say that the Democrats lost due to their total disrespect towards Bush, and that Moore is the best example of this attitude. What sense does this make? As if the Republicans have always been so flattering towards their opponents, and as if O'Reilly is such a nice guy. Sure.

B0006284JQ|4.0|After listening to this CD, I realized that this was more of a collection of some of Britney Spears' greatest singles than it was greatest hits. If it were just focused on her greatest hits, all of her songs would have found a place on this CD in some way. Missing are \\"From the Bottom of my Broken Heart,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,\\" \\"Born to Make You Happy,\\" and \\"I Love Rock and Roll.\\" The odd thing is that they are included on the \\"Greatest Hits\\" overseas, where they were all released as singles. The U.S. version of this album, in my opinion, was cheated out of at least one or two more songs.<br /><br />  The \\"limited edition\\" bonus CD seemed a little out of place as well. Instead of getting a sampling of her entire career, most of the songs chosen are from her \\"In the Zone\\" era. I would have liked to have had a remix of \\"Oops!... I did it Again\\" or \\"Baby One More Time,\\" or perhaps even \\"I'm A Slave 4 U.\\" Instead, the remixes included are for the songs \\"Everytime,\\" \\"Outrageous,\\" \\"Toxic,\\" and the unexpected one, \\"Breathe on Me.\\" The good news is that these are said to have never been released before and all are above average in quality. There is also a \\"Megamix\\" by Chris Cox that does span the entire 5 year career thus far but seems almost too short.<br /><br />  Those are really my only complaints about the CD. What I really enjoyed is that all the tracks sound better than ever. Some of these may have been remastered and even if some just went back and did a touch-up on some of the vocals and background beats, it make a world of a difference and enhances the sound. I am glad that someone decided to include the video-version of some of the songs. For \\"Sometimes\\" it is the (Stop! Remix) that made me wonder why we didn't get that sort of quality on the first CD. Finally we have the \\"Darkchild\\" remix of \\"Overprotected\\" even if it is only the Radio Edit. I couldn't tell much of a difference though.<br /><br />  As for new songs, there's the given, \\"My Prerogative\\" that sounds more like a statement being made than a controversial song it was marked up to be. Spears did say she was planning on taking two or so years off of her career to deal with her life and family. She plans to return and reivent herself and her sound (Madonna's influence perhaps?). \\"Do Something\\" makes me wonder if this is the new direction she wants to take. It's a great song! I was surprised by how different it sounded. If you didn't know it was Britney singing it'd be easy to mistake it for a Gwyen Stefani track. The vocals are very different and the sound is very fresh, nothing like it is really out there. She also curses in it (the F word can be picked out). This is definately a break for Spears who seems to stay \\"in the safe zone\\" for the most part. \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" was a favorite track from the \\"In the Zone\\" era that didn't get put on the CD but was offered as an extra or download from many places. It definately is a great song and it was a hit on the Internet for Spears. \\"Outrageous\\" was a fun inclusion as well since it has to be one of Spears' more interesting and catchy tracks. It was produced by drama king R. Kelly after all, what would you expect?<br /><br />  This CD is fun and even with it being so short compared to other countries' releases, I'd still recommend it. It'd be a nice gift for a fan or for someone who's been interested in Britney Spears or the pop scene. Not all the songs on here can be considered \\"pop\\" in my opinion but this is a good sampling or start for someone trying to get into Britney's music.ven, \\"My Prerogative\\" that sounds more like a statement being made than a controversial song it was marked up to be.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain's Greatest Hits album is probably the best GH album released this year by a country/pop artist. This GH album contains almost all your favorite shania's songs but a few are missing out such as \\"You've Got A Way\\" and \\"She's Not Just A Pretty Face\\", but most of them in it are good. Some old songs are different from what you used to hear,  \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good\\" and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" have new instrumental arrangements, gives a new touch to the old version and I like the new sound. The new song \\"Party For Two\\" included here have pop / country version featuring Mark McGarth / Billy Currington, country fans will probably favor the country version with Billy. Both version is different with different instruments. I like the country over the pop version. Don't is another new song which sounds very country, a slow love songs that sounds nothing like what Shania ever did, simply awesome. I Ain't No Quitter is a new country song that I don't like very much, its just not Shania's style of music, Its sounds like its classic country, I prefer Shania singing modern country..  <br /> <br />But nonetheless... its worth buying this album as it clocks at over 77 minutes and cost less that 11 bucks, (might be even cheaper elsewhere). And it contains a lot of my old-time favorite Shania's track such as \\"forever and for always\\", \\"man! I feel like a woman!\\", \\"from this moment on\\", \\"you're still the one\\", \\"love gets me everytime\\", \\"the woman in me\\", \\"any man of mine\\", \\"whose bed have your boots been under\\".... <br />
B0006IUDXA|5.0|What is not to like about this fabulous series?  Action, drama, comedy and problem solving.  And its all family friendly.  MacGyver used his brain, not guns to get himself and his friends out of trouble.  What mother could say no to a show like that?  Not to mention kids can actually learn a thing or two from this show, unlike ones on today. The show presented a good role model while being highly entertaining at the same time.  And most importantly, he was easy on the eyes :)

Or how amazing it is that Norah Jones is so famous in a world of auto-tuning and over production on most everything else out there. <br /> <br />Her success has given me new faith in out musical tastes. <br />Not everything has to be fast and electronic to be something that we pay for. <br /> <br />I've sat at my own piano, trying it out. <br /> <br />-Bought singing lesson Cds, \\"Voice lessons To Go\\", by Vaccarino, <br />did the Artist Way by Cameron to free my creative flow. <br /> <br />All as a result of this young girl simply singing at her piano. Wow her piano teacher must be pleased.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, along with the Shawshawnk Redemption.  It presents the story of a good, whole-hearted man in George Jung.  The movie captivated me in such a powerful, emotional way.  I'm 23 now, and I only wish I were this age back in the 70s when the bulk of this movie took place.  Some may negatively label George Jung as a criminal for dealing marijuana and then cocaine, but I don't see it like that. Doing or selling drugs doesn't make anybody less of a person.  It was his choice, and unfortunately he had some betraying friends and was unjustifiably put in jail for life.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Miss Kristin Chenoweth... If there is a greater star on the rise on the great white way I dare you to name her. I spend my days puttering around in my care listening to Ariella Vaccarino's must-have CD series \\"Voice Lessons to Go\\" in preparation for the moment I put the real deal on here and try my best to match the vocal styling of Ms. Chenoweth... and fail (but maybe with these vocal CDs I've been listening to... who knows). Anyway, the woman is a queen of the stage at the moment and this recording is a vocal photograph of a true star in the midst of her prime. I highly recommend buying it.

0780020685|5.0|i'm not going to get all into the production details of this movie and where it is located and all that jazz.  what i want to say is that this movie is the best thing to ever grace my sight. at first i thought it would be tough getting used to full-screen ( i hate full screen formats!).  but alas, the movie was so good i didn't even realize the black bars were gone.  of course, akira kurosawa didn't use widescreen until after the fifties, or was it late fifties...hmm?  all i know is yojimbo is in wide screen and it didn't come out too long after seven samurai.  and i found out something new after watching this movie:  toshiro mifune is/was the greatest actor of his time.  he steals nearly every scene with his humor and genuine zest for life.  the movie is black and white and runs about three and a half hours.  there is an intermission halfway through, i don't know how long that is, i always skip it.  but anyway, this is probably the best movie ever made, and probably will keep that title in my book until they resurrect the great kurosawa and make him perform another miracle.  the film takes place in a small village, one that bandits keep raiding for food, and the villagers are too poor and hungry to fight them off themselves, so they go on a little journey to hire some samurai. some hilarity ensues in the recruiting process but once everyone is on board, buckle up for the greatest movie going experience of your life.  but seriously, this movie really is that good.  mostly for the character interaction.  when something is funny, it's not funny just to make the audience laugh, but it's because whatever is happening on screen to the characters is funny, and they laugh about it, too.  when something goes wrong, the movie takes a very serious turn, and when someone or something is sad or depressed, you can't help but feel their pain.  i think akira kurosawa was the only director to ever catch such human nature on film, and he directed everything, so he must've really knew what he was doing.  and to think, a legendary movie such as this got mixed reviews when it was released in japan in the fifties.  and was like number three in the best movies of the year, there, that year.  so, it's not for everybody, but i do think that every person alive should see this movie at one point in there life.  but a bit of a warning, after you see this movie and really appreciate what a masterpiece it is, every other movie will seem so much less important.  everything else will just turn to crap in your eyes, because this is THE movie to watch.  it's sheer genious and i feel very lucky to have seen it, and even luckier to own it.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Just like the old Talking Heads song, psychologist Chris Kelvin wakes up in his spartan sleeping chamber aboard a space station orbiting the enigmatic planet Solaris to discover his wife Rheya by his side. His beautiful wife, awake, close to his side, easing him out of one nightmare and into another.<br /><br />There's one minor complication: Rheya has been dead for years.<br /><br />So there you have it: Kelvin, stunned, having a David Byrne-esque \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" moment, wondering \\"is this my beautiful wife\\"? And for much of Steven Soderbergh's heartbreaking, masterful, quiet and searing \\"Solaris\\", the supposition is that maybe that doesn't matter very much.<br /><br />\\"Solaris\\" is not Soderbergh's finest hour---for that look to \\"Kafka\\". But that said, it is a quiet masterpiece, a brave film that operates solely on its own terms and offers the viewer absolutely no quarter nor compromise. Surrender yourself and your time to the film's immediacy, just as the survivors on the film's spartan space station give themselves over to the unknowable forces on the planet, and you will probably be as moved as I was.<br /><br />Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel and reprising the material in Andrei Tarkovsky's epic Russian film, Soderbergh's \\"Solaris\\" is only incidentally science fiction. It's more a thin skein of science fiction stretched taut across a dense, luminous surface of human pain, of the anguish and fallibility of memory, of love, of love lost, of the possibility of redemption. That's really what Soderberg wants to cut down into, and he wields a brutally sharp scalpel here.<br /><br />Have you lost the thing you loved most in your life? Have you lost true love? Fine: what would you do if you thought you could reclaim it, salvage the moment you lost it, make things right again?<br /><br />What would that be worth to you?<br /><br />What would you do to get it?<br /><br />That, in essence, is \\"Solaris\\". Oh yes, to be sure, the plot is about a space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris; the station's corporate owners have lost contact with it, and a rescue team is equally silent. The DBA Corporation turns to Clooney's Chris Kelvin (bravely and masterfully played by George Clooney, who owns this film), a psychologist who was a colleague of the station's chief scientist Gibarian, who had sent across a mysterious invitation to Kelvin before the first security team had been dispatched. He arrives to a scene of unnervingly, creepily quiet chaos, with Gibarian dead and the rest of the crew having retreated to their separate quarters, plagued by what they contend are visions.<br /><br />Much like Polanski's \\"The Ninth Gate\\", \\"Solaris\\" suffered from a marketing campaign that perhaps emphasized too much the science fiction elements of the piece. The space station, the planet, the sere, technical, sleek surfaces of the examination rooms and sleeping quarters are merely palletes on which Clooney paints his own internal torment and very private suffering, writ large; the space setting is, like Holocaust-era Warsaw in \\"The Pianist\\", almost incidental to the movie. This film could have been set anywhere---underground, in the desert, in a skyscraper penthouse.<br /><br />Soderbergh directs deftly, fluidly, using his technically precise sets as counterpoints to the choices the crew of the space station must make. The acting here is top-notch: Clooney turns in a laser-perfect performance, Natasha McElhone is remarkably poised and completely convincing, Jeremy Davies provides a few wan laughs as the unnerved Snow, and Viola Davis fights the good fight as Gordon, who absolutely, positively will not let the Human Race be undone by good intentions. And here, by the way, is just one of trillions of deft little touches Soderbergh uses, this one hinting of alien invasion: what better way for some vast intelligence to undermine humanity than by burrowing at us through our emotions?<br /><br />For all the breathtaking expansiveness of the shots,which draw favorable comparison with Kubrick's work in 2001, this is an interior movie, and the film lives or dies on the chemistry and work between Clooney and McElhone. For my money, they are remarkable together. Each scene between them, each line, each breath, each facial contortion, tells; there is not a wasted sequence or shot here, and technically this may very well be Soderbergh's most compact, complete, and least pretentious film.<br /><br />Tragedy, horror story, dark night of the soul, fable of a love lost---whatever it is, \\"Solaris\\" is unforgettable.ng expansiveness of the shots, which draw favorable comparison with Kubrick's work in 2001, this is an interior movie, and the film lives or dies on the chemistry and work between Clooney and McElhone.

B00005JN0T|1.0|Look: what you came to see was Will Smith, a typically competent actor who can do macho-hip-urban-cool in his sleep, and lots of shiny stuff exloding and breaking, right? You did *not* come to wrestle with the eternal soul-crushing dilemma of what, exactly, constitutes Artificial Intelligence, and whether or not it constitutes a Moral Evil to use creatures with feelings and 250 IQ points to clean our toilets and haul out our trash.<br /><br />Am I wrong? Well I tell you this, whatever the case: if you wanted shiny things getting broken with a side order of Will Smith, you got cheated. Check out \\"Independence Day\\" for that. And if you wanted to wrestle with the soul-searing, heart-warming problem of what to do with your local warm-fuzzy AI robot, then you should check out \\"Blade Runner\\".<br /><br />The point is this: \\"I, Robot\\" is cinematic carbon dioxide: it's odorless, colorless, and tasteless. In fact, it's riskless: it's so determined to be a staunch, dollar-earning blockbuster that it does absolutely nothing daring or terrifying. Did you know that good-guy robots wink at you to let you know everything is all right? No? Did you know that you can tell the Evil Wicked Robots from the Duddly-Do-Right Robots by the little chest lantern: Red means Evil, Blue means Good? You didn't? Did you ever expect that on a weekend you'd be watching Will Smith cowering at the top of a Chicago skyscraper while Evil Robots climb up the building ready to do him in?<br /><br />\\"I, Robot\\" is without a doubt the stupidest (and I use that word intentionally, because the movie merits it), most boring film I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through. It is amazing someone like the talented Alex Proyas (who helmed up the nifty \\"Dark City\\" and iconic \\"The Crow\\") had his hand in this slick, sleek, embarrassing and boring mess. It is positively sacrilegious that the great science-fiction luminary Isaac Asimov has his name affixed to this thing---if anything justified rising from the dead and eating brains, \\"I, Robot\\" is it. And it didn't have to be this way: even on a strictly action-movie level, Proyas manages to take some potentially cool scenes (the hulking, scary, highway robot transports) and completely ruin them (again, more robots jumping on a car...zzzzzz).<br /><br />The thing that annoys me most about the excremental \\"I, Robot\\" is that I now suspect the robot was winking at me because he knew I couldn't get my money back. The movie's original tag-line was \\"One Man Saw it Coming\\". If only I had.the dead and eating brains, \\"I, Robot\\" is it.

B00005JNDX|5.0|I laughed my butt off during this movie. I looked forward to it--and it was well worth the wait! Colin Firth is absolutely charming, I'm such a fan now. Hugh is as cheeky as ever, and it's good to see Bridget have a nice balance between depression and glee. She really is a lot more chipper in this movie and it's infectious! I'm seeing it AGAIN tomorrow!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|The Amazon review of this album is so inaccurate. Matthew Cooke obviously didn't listen to this album more than once. Muse are one of the most original bands currently around and this album is certainly not 'unoriginal' as he calls it - name any other current rock band that can use a grand piano to such great effect, particularly as they do on the albums pinnacle - 'Butterflies and Hurricanes'. Sends shivers down my spine when I hear that song. And they certainly aren't 'going around in circles' as Matthew Cooke suggests - if anything, they are on a stairway to heaven.... <br /> <br />Tip: If anyone just getting into Muse hasn't listened to their previous album, Origin of Symmetry, buy that next - its a true classic and one of my all time favorite albums.   <br />
0140277447|5.0|Since Japanese are still refusing to concede that they invaded China from 1894 thru 1945, instead, they defend they \\"ENTERed\\" China. For chinese guys, if we wanna enter the USA, we have to apply a visa to obtain legal entry into the USA. However, I am wondering whether Japanese applied Chinese visa when they \\"ENTERed\\" China. If not, it's not \\"ENTER\\", instead, it's \\"INVADE\\". For American readers, if some strangers \\"ENTER\\" your house w/o your permit, what's your action? Of coz, this rule is also applied to Japanese. During the 911 nightmire, thousands of american people were killed by terrorist, which made the United States \\"United\\". At the end of 1937, 300,000 Chinese people were raped by Japanese in Nanjing, the capital of China at that time. Don't you think it is nightmire? If 300,000 American people were raped in Washington DC by Japanese, what's your feeling now? Thanks for your reading. And if you really like this book, please   tell your family, your friend, your neighbor and your community. This is a true story happended in 1937 in China, and it was made by Japanese. Shame on Japanese who are still refusing to commit their guilty.
B0000797IO|3.0|Even though it stars Jennifer Aniston of the thankfully canceled, obnoxious, fake sitcom Friends and it's written by Mike White, who wrote Orange County this is not a comedy movie, a romantic movie or a chick flick. More of a bleak drama with the feel of an independent movie.<br /><br />In some dead-end Texas town a supermarket checkout girl longs for a more exciting life, stares off into space with a disconnected look and moans a lot. In one of her stares she connects with Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), a lonely, borderline insane young writer. A much needed affair breathes some life into her existence.<br /><br />I wasn't entirely satisfied with the film overall. There wasn't a good explanation for Justine actions and decisions in the film's climax. Who's baby is she carrying? Why did she betray Holden? She's not a good girl. Not by far. So I'm assuming the title is meant to be an ironic one.<br /><br />Anyone expecting Friends or Picture Perfect or Along Came Polly or Object of My Affection or any of the endless incarnations of Rachel Green be warned...it ain't that way.<br /><br />Probably the most mature work Jennifer Aniston has done. But there's still an incomplete feeling to it all. Worth watching with no pre-judgments.
B00064MW6A|5.0|I really loved this movie.  So much so that I saw it twice on the same night.  I have not seen such a good movie in many years.  What made it so good was the terrific sound track.  I want to buy it as soon as it comes out and the movie also.  I loved the plot and Halle's movements as a cat looked very real.  The special effects were quite good.  I really will look forward to a sequel when it comes out.  Who cares if it really follows the comic book plots.  Lets have something new and creative.

Don't they ever understand there is something called CONSCIENCE in the world? If these are the comments from &#34;genereal&#34; Japanese, do you think they deserve any respect at all? Remember, how people treat you is determined by how you treat people.<br /><br />&#62;Have these people who hate Japanese witnessed the holocaust by themselves? Do they at least have a connection to the victims? Do they hate any Japanese people in front of them even if they have nothing to do with the war?<br />&#62;Do they know that this unfounded hatred against a specific race is nothing but racism and nothing different from what the Japanese soldiers used for an excuse to kill Chinese people in those days?<br />&#62;I would not argue the credability of the content of this book nor agree with the Japanese government's attitude to the history problems.<br />All of us may not have witnessed or suffered from the holocaust ourselves, but we did witness the prime minister of Japan officially visiting the Yasukuni Shrine every year and praying for the soldiers including those class-A war criminals who killed thousands of our people. We did witness these right-wing Japanese shamelessly fabricating and distorting history in the high-school textbooks. Don't you understand it's nothing about racism? Just imagine if your neighbors killed your brothers, raped your sisters, then their family members claim that everything is fabricated and refuse to apologize to you, will you forgive them? Does it matter whether they are white, black, or yellow skinned? Does it matter whether they are capitalists or communists?<br /><br />&#62;The only thing I can say is that we have to stop the cycle of hatred. The hatred does not make us move forward.

B00003CXD5|5.0|1948 was an Oscar duel between the British import \\"Hamlet\\" by Laurence Olivier (with six nominations) and the American production of \\"The Treasure of Sierra Madre\\" by John Huston (with four Oscar bids). Both dramatic pictures were B/W and were heavy favorites to dominate the awards (and did so with seven wins between them).    John Huston deservedly won best director and best screenplay (with the joke that William Shakespeare wasn't eligible for \\"Hamlet\\" that year). The film is a dark one that explores the themes of greed and madness with superb all-around performances, especially by Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart. By directing his father, a veteran character actor of stage and screen, to the best suporting actor prize, John Huston made Oscar history -- it mark the first time that a father and son won Oscars in the same year for the same film.    Inexplicably, Mr. Bogart was not even nominated for best actor in what arguably was his finest performance of his long career -- this oversight would contribute to his win three years later in another John Huston production of \\"The African Queen.\\" He is mesmerizing as the American who literally and ever so slowly goes insane over his pot of gold.     At the end of the 1948 Oscar awards, \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"The Treasure Of Sierra Madre\\" were tied with three Oscars each -- \\"Hamlet\\" would  break the tie by winning best picture and giving Mr Olivier his second Oscar win of the evening (to go with his best actor win). Similiar in themes, both films are worth seeing and  the viewer can decide which they prefer more.
B000002N3J|5.0|I have always loved Madonna, she is my favorite singer, and artist, in the whole world but I have really liked her dance, upbeat songs which is why I wasn't so sure about getting this album.<br /><br /> It's all her famous ballads which have never been my favorites, but even \\"Crazy for You\\" and \\"Live to tell\\" work here in ways they don't make it for me in the Immaculate Collection!<br /><br />I got it just yesterday and have already listened to it completely twice!<br /><br />  All of the songs are in some sort of perfetc harmony it's as if it wasn't a mere compilation but a new album, all the songs sound fresh together.<br /><br /> Among the best are her rendition of \\"I Want You\\" which has this beat and sensual nostalgia that makes it irresistible, there are two versions in the album with Massive Attack who make the arrangements and are brilliant!<br /><br />  There's a remix of \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" and what was then the new song \\"You'll See\\", I prefer the Spanish version which sounds more heartfelt but isn't here unfortunately.<br /><br />  The album came out when Madge was doing Evita and it seems to remind us of the voice and the emotional power this pop queen has, as she herself says she's not only controversial, she also sings and her music is what has kept her here so long!
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I have to say  that  I enjoyed this movie very much.  It definitly was on of Orlando's hottest looks.  That really is the main reason I went to  see the movie. Oh my, I faint at the thought of the wonderful sight of him(faint faint).  If you don't like it then you're not nice!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|This item has been a LONG time coming. I became mesmorized by the show MacGyver in the early 80's and followed it ever since. It is great to finally be able to collect this great tv show in an unedited format. The show has never seemed to lose its popularity, and it's one show that even my kids love to watch with me. This is a must-have for old and new Macgyver fans alike!

B0002VL0KQ|2.0|We were very excited to purchase this CD, since our 5 year old was growing tired of her Kenny Loggins and Linda Ronstadt lullaby CDs.  We still use the baby monitors, so we were excited to be able to listen to something new, too.  We were very surprised and not happy that this CD is basically Celine belting out lullaby songs at almost full voice, with lots of times with a very soft, soothing passage and then suddenly a very loud section.  It kept startling my daughter awake.  We ended up putting it in the garage sale.  Very disappointing.  Update:  we recently found \\"Sleeping with the Fishes\\" and give it a rating of 5 stars for the kids!

This film is a rare gem and is unlike anyone of the modern movies

B000005JAK|5.0|People can talk on and on about how amazing zen arcade, or double nickels on the dime(no offense to either, because they're both great albums)are, but in the midst of the let it be's and murmur's, their was this lost little gem Candy Apple Grey. When i first heard Husker Du, i was let down, very much so indeed. I was, and still am big in to the replacements, and r.e.m., so i decided i needed to get an album by one of the other biggest post punk artists. so i saw zen arcade, heard it was their best, and bought it, much to my dismay. I was so dissapointed by it. too much junk on it it seemed like, so i basically gave up on the Huskers. Until one day i was shopping at a record store, and saw another Husker Du album entitle Candy Apple GRey(you rarely see anything other than zen arcade around here, so i was amazed to see another album by them). I thought to myself \\"well i didn't love the replacements when i got tim, but instead when i got let it be\\" so i bought the thing, and fell in love with it. This album overpowers everything else in the husker du cannon. the songs are so melodic, and beautiful, even the louder songs. This is without a doubt Grant Harts finest hour, with standouts like Don't Want to know if you are lonely, sorry somehow, deadset on destruction, and the heartbreaking no promise have i made. Bob Moulds 2 acoustic numbers, and i don't know for sure, are really his best songs on this album, while the rest are fine, they just don't stand a chance against harts heartwrenching numbers. of course the music is as good as ever, but about as melodic as it possibly could get, which is a good thing by the way, to all you punk rock snobs who think husker du sold out when they made zen arcade. but anyways, the lyrics too are also heartbreaking, and very worn out sounding. this album sort of reminds me of the replacements final record, all shook down, because of the title, possibly lifted from too far down? and both albums very worn sounds. so if you are into the whole post punk scene, and like the mats, and rem, and minutemen, and so on and so fourth, get zen arcade for about your 3rd husker du allbum. why buy what's the most popular, and talked about, when this little piece of beauty is just dying to be discovered.
B000062YB1|5.0|When you think of Slayer, you think of Reign in Blood. But this is definitly superior to that in more ways than one. The last with Lombardo, which is a shame,is my favorite Slayer albumn, with the classics, Dead Skin Mask and Seasons in the Abyss. It starts off with one of the best Slayer songs around, War Ensemble. Its at breakneck speed(what song isnt) and has an awesome solo by Kerry King. This is always played live and for good reason. The next two songs are underrated gems. Blood Red, has some awesome riffs in it and Spirit in Black might be my favorite song on the album. It has great drumming, lots of time changes, good solos, the works. Then there is Expendable Youth, a gang violence song which is a little slower, more South of Heaven type. Dead Skin Mask, a classic, with some cherry lyrics, is another live staple. Hallowed Point, which they've just now started to play live, is definity my favorite song on the album. Its fast, hard, knocks the crap out of you. Skeletons of Society and Temptation... well they pretty much suck. The exceptions to the album, pretty much fillers. Born of Fire is an average, fast, satanic Slayer song. Finally there is the just plain wonderful opener of Seasons in the Abyss, which leads into an awesome song with more melodic(?) singing in the chorus. <br />So there ya go, with a mixture of Reign and South of Heavan styles, this is a perfect album for new and old Slayer fans alike.
B000002UZ6|5.0|No words can describe how truly amazing an artist Tina Turner is.  When she debuted in the late 1950's as half of Ike And Tina, she immediately made music history.  Through the years, the duo released hit after hit including their most successful, a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Proud Mary\\".  Throughout, Tina Turner was always the center of attention while Ike stayed in the background with his guitar.  After their bitter divorce in 1977, Tina went solo.  This is when she would conquer the world with fierce ambition. <br /> <br />With the acceptions of \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\" and \\"Nutbush City Limits\\", this 1991 album release \\"Simply the Best\\" compiles her hits after going solo.  Every song was written perfectly styled to suit her.  All have that unique ingredient that suits her well.  Whether rock, pop, R&B, or gospel, they maintain the quality that attracts listeners.  The most noted is her biggest success \\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\" from 1984.  Her vocal performances are only one aspect that earns her the title Queen of Rock.  Her fierce and heartfelt performances always express her sung words to the fullest.  Listeners can sense her strength and pain everytime she sings.  Her highest potential energy is always presented in her performances. <br /> <br />Such talents prove why she has become one of the most influencial women in music history.  Therefore, she's more that a music icon.  It'll likely take many more years until another artist comes close to touching her territory.  This makes \\"Simply the Best\\" a must-have for Tina Turner fans.  This is sure to continue pleasing listeners for many more years.  <br />
B0001NBMBC|3.0|It seems that in the metal world Slipknot is despised beyond belief so I checked this out of curiousity. After looking at this and some of there older stuff its very mixed feelings... <br />This album IS a horrible metal albumn, but if you take it in a rock perspective its better than half of the other stuff out there. This band actually has potential to make a good metal albumn, but itd take a few steps that most likely arent going to happen. Like for instance, ditching the extra band members. They really just bring the band down; its a waste for two extra percussionists that you cant even hear on the albumn. Also, an interesting addition, Slipknot had a few SOLOS on this albumn. Add those to each song and itd be progress. And one thing I hate about this album... is the singing/melody passages thrown in. Vermillion is just disgusting to me. Get rid of these disasters and then we might be looking at a descent albumn. <br /> <br />Now some positive things are, again, the better guitar work on this albumn. Also, Joey is an awesome drummer that could be just as good as Paul Baustoph. There are a few more sophisticatedly(wow) written songs, which is a plus. And some riffs are in here that could please the average metalhead. So if your into hard/extreme rock, pick it up. If your into Slayer and old Metallica, stay away.

It vividly decribes the Chinese people's suffering and the city's disarster brought by the Janpanese Nazi.  It reveals the history denied by the current Japanese government.  The crulty described is far beyound imagination.  It is no less than the Auschwitz Concentration Camp, if not more.  For those who want to know more about the Chinese history in WW2 and the Japanese holocaust in Nanking, it is a good choice.

It stays true to the spirit of the book.  They of course had to add some to make it a full-length movie, but everything that's in the book is in the movie too.  Go take your children to see it.  The animation is also awesome and draws you into the movie.  It seems so real.  Also, adults, look for Steven Tyler towards the end. ;)

B00005OAIE|4.0|This was definately worth the money. It's a wonderful CD to listen to whenever. If you need some motivation to do house work, if you have people over for dinner and you want something nice to listen to, or if you're planning a romantic evening for 2. There are so many stories in these songs and it's worth taking some time and listening to the lyrics. He's incredibly talented for such a young guy. I was shocked to hear '83 because I really didn't know how old he was until I listened to it. Fabulous!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is perfection. I am a huge fan of all music that is passionate and complicated. I really do not care for Prog music at all. On this one, these perfectly polished musicans became very deep, emotional and soulful. This is their crown jewel. I don't think they could understand how it became, and they did it. They hit a vibe and they know it. I went and saw them live just because of this work and was blown away. It is actually like beautiful artwork. It is simple, it is thought provoking, it is easy and it feels.... it lifts itself off of the canvas and has its own idenity. Everytime you listen to it you hear and feel something striking.
0790734850|5.0|Hollywood in the 1940s: The LAPD is primed to forge a prestigious, competent public image when the incarceration of crime kingpin Mickey Cohen provides the opportunity to rid LA of organized crime.  Three officers symbolize the directions the department might take: Bud White (Russell Crowe), violent and flexible with his ethics; Ed Exley (Guy Pierce), a by-the-book opportunist; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), plugged into the show business scene and eager to remain so.  A massacre at a coffee shop starts a series of events that will offer each of these morally conflicted men a measure of redemption. <br /> <br />This film boasts a huge cast of characters and a complex storyline but never confuses.  Director/co-screenwriter Curtis Hansen deserves high praise, as does his marvelous cast.  This film has tremendous atmosphere and feels absolutely authentic.  Highly recommended. <br />
B000059H99|5.0|I just want to remind everyone that Rocky did not win the fight. He was not the new champ. He lost the fight. That is part of what was so great about this movie. He did not care if he won the fight he just did not want to look like a fool. They NEVER should have made 2-15 or whatever. This was a perfect movie, and the sequels just made people think of this movie as a the first in long line of bad movies. If you tell people that this movie won Best picture they will probably not believe you. This is a great movie.
0971057907|5.0|Like most homebrewers, I started out with Charlie Papazian's book \\"The New Joy of Homebrewing\\".  I had the second edition.  It was a good book, but comparing it to this text, it seems hopelessly dated.   <br /> <br />With the explosion of microbreweries across the country, lots of people got turned on to GOOD beer - and many of those looked into homebrewing.  With so many people trying different methods and equipment, over time, brewing became simpler and much of what was deemed necessary in the earlier days was discarded.  Many of the techniques and equipment listed here are the results of years of trial-and-error streamlining by other homebrewers.  In addition, there's never been so many resources available via mail order and on the net.  Homebrewing really is easy at this point. <br /> <br />This is the best basic brewing text I've found.  You can start with it by making extract only beers, graduating to specialty grains in addition to extract, then to all grain brewing and making your own recipes and beer styles.  The book is linear, presents the information as you need it and the information ranges from the most basic (like sanitation) to as technical as you could possibly want (water chemistry).   <br /> <br />For years I've been an extract and specialty grain brewer.  I never completely understood the process of all-grain brewing until I bought this text.  It gave me the courage to build my own lautering tun and brew my first batch of beer made completely from scratch.  It was a pale ale, nothing exotic, but man was it good beer.  Check out the author's website and read the first edition online.  The second edition is improved, so if you like the online text buy the hard copy book. <br /> <br />There are other good texts out there (the author lists many of them in the back of the book) but if you only want one homebrewing text, buy this one.  It's a shame that Amazon doesn't carry it anymore.  Track it down.
B00005JNDX|3.0|Bridget (Renee Zellweger) is back with Mark (Colin Firth) and Daniel (Hugh Grant) in tow: looking resplendent in a variety of wacky outfits, which only accentuate not hide her weight concerns.<br /><br />But some of the fun and gloss of the first installment is gone, however. Zellweger is still chipper and a blast as Bridget. It's just that the plot and everything surrounding her is just a bit off.<br /><br />Many scenes, in particular the Skiing sequence, reminds me of a similar one from a 1960's Doris Day movie: which is OK if it is done in the same light, snappy vein, but it isn't... it just falls flat. Humorless.<br /><br />One scene that does work is the fountain scene/fight between Darcy and Daniel. It's silly, awkward and dumb.... but very very funny.<br /><br />But to tell the truth, what we all want to see anyway is some kind of resolution to the Bridget-Darcy-Daniel triangle. Am I right? And we get one...finally. But like life it takes awhile to get there.<br /><br />\\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" is humorous and sometimes even downright funny. But with all the talent involved here, this last of the Bridget Jones movies should of at least been all the things that the first one was: warm, emotional, caring and hilarious.
B00006CXXU|3.0|I think this album goes to show that Christina is trying to grow up way too fast.  But, that doesn't make this album completely terrible.  Some good songs on this album are: \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Loving Me For Me\\", \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\", \\"I'm OK\\", \\"Dirrty\\", \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Singing My Song\\", and \\"Impossible\\".  If you're a huge Christina fan like I am, buy this album.
B000002HFU|5.0|I'll keep this brief.  As a middle-aged white woman who isn't the biggest rap/hip-hop expert in the world, I want to say that we have lost a singular talent with the passing of Ol' Dirty.  This album is a great place to hear the demented craziness that he personified in his raps.  I hope the album he was working on over the last year of his life sees the light of day.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
B000099T2L|5.0|I'm one of Beyonce's BIGGEST fans, and I would've written this review earlier if I only had known about this website.  I love her work with Destiny's Child, and she's making even more fans with this debut.  There's only one song on this album that I don't like-\\"Speechless\\".  But, the rest of the album makes up for that pitfall.  It took me awhile to get used to \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" because it sounded like she wasn't really singing like she normally does.  It sounded more like she was whining, moaning, and groaning.      Many people say that Beyonce cannot sing, and that all she can do is dance and shake her thang.  That's not true at all!  If you even take a listen to this album, you'll here her vocal power and prowess on tracks like \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" (taken from Destiny's Child's 2001 album \\"Survivor\\"), \\"Me, Myself & I\\" and \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" (a duet with Luther Vandross).  If you listen to this album, you will agree with me.      I must say that the only thing that I didn't like about this album is that there are way too many guests here, making it quite difficult to enjoy more of Beyonce than Missy, Jay, Luther, Sean Paul, Sleepy Brown, and Big Boi.  However, that does not take away from \\"Dangerously In Love\\"'s beautiful, sexy, and mature style of R&B that many fans of Destiny's Child, Beyonce, and the R&B genre as a whole will enjoy.    Track ratings:    \\"Crazy In Love\\" - 5/5    \\"Baby Boy\\" - 4/5    \\"Naughty Girl\\" - 5/5    \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" - 3/5    \\"Be With You\\" - 5/5    \\"Me, Myself & I\\" - 5/5    \\"Yes\\" - 4/5    \\"Signs\\" - 5/5    \\"Speechless\\" - 2/5    \\"That's How You Like It\\" - 5/5    \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" - 5/5    \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" - 5/5    \\"Daddy\\" - 3/5
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Picoult has written a book so intense that you feel as if you're apart of this family.  She brings you into each character so you feel their emotions and thoughts.  All I could think about while reading this book was \\"what would I do\\".  It's easy to judge another person, until it happens to you.  The way it was written was so true to life that it was hard to believe that it was fiction.  Well researched and so true to life are the characters.  The story was full of unpredictable turns, just like life itself.  A story worth reading.  I will be purchasing more of her books in the future based on this one.
0140277447|5.0|I haven't read this book yet, but there're a couple of words i want to say after reading so many reviews here.  <br /> <br />As a Chinese, i grew up with a hard feeling with Japanese because of all the stories i learned from books, movies as well as relations of the direct victims about the brutal crimes they had done during WWII. But more anger actually comes from the continuous denials of the history by the Japanese government and a lot of its people. <br /> <br />However, to avoid bias, i think i need to do more independent research to find the truth for myself. And the one thing that makes me give 5 stars for this book is that this book raises such public awareness of this period of history. HATRED, EXTREMISM, PREJUDICE AND APATHY all come from IGNORANCE. So i believe no matter for Chinese, Japanese, Americans or any other world citizens, it's necessary for us to make our endeavors to read more and research more about the history, and share with each other; to make our endeavors to walk out of this ignorance and return to the history the justice it deserves.   <br /> <br />Thank Iris for her great contributions. Thank everyone who shared his/her passion and compassion.  <br /> <br />We cannot judge on history, but history will judge on us.  <br /> <br />And we always need to take the responsibilities for what we have done, though sometimes that might be something that we wish we'd never have done.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Lets get going with this... <br /> <br />1. The Package, a weird song that sucks you into the dark and drags you down, it starts of slow gets slower in the middle and bam its kicks you in the stomach... <br /> <br />2. Weak and Powerless, A great song its on the radio first single they droped and dam its great... <br /> <br />3. The Noose, is the most Beutiful song ever, lol im a a guy I have to not act gay so thats where beutiful came from... Anyway song will stick you and keep you... <br /> <br />4. Blue, starts off with a little strings and into the blue you go... <br /> <br />5. Vanishing, its a very weird song, I dont like to voice what I think the songs are talking about so You wont see that in my reviews, Im not here to pick the means Im here to tell you if the songs are worth a listen, and this being crazy you might fall in love or you might hate it, I have fallen in love with it... <br /> <br />6. A Stranger, Slow, Strong, nothing like I expect... <br /> <br />7. The Outsider, I happen to think its the best song on this cd, but many will say other wise, just take a listen for yourself its a rocking song... \\"If you chose to pull the triger\\". \\"do it somewhere far away from here\\"... <br /> <br />8. Crimes, Just numbers, I think they put it in to play with your mind... <br /> <br />9. The Nurse who loved me, it has a very old fell to it, it has a sound of the old days the way its sung and the way the music is flowing... <br /> <br />10. Pet, I could tell you what its truly about, but why Its angerness at full power to the way things are... <br /> <br />11. Lullaby is really the ending and slowing down of pet, a cool down if you will... <br /> <br />12. Gravity, I just like the over all sound and fell of this song its great, I like the words \\"I chose to live\\"  its really saying to me that all the other songs where him getting his hate and he was close to death from drugs and boozz, and then Gravity chagnes it around and says he wants to live, sorry for telling you kind of what I think the song stands for but I took a slip, it just makes the music crazy and I love every minute of this cd... <br /> <br />I was very unsure about this cd the first run through, because not all the songs will jam like Weak and Powerless and the outsider but all got to me in the end and showed me that music does not have to just jam that slow songs can rock and suck you in just as well...
0440237688|5.0|What is there to say, really? I mean come on!     You just have to read this book!!! There is no better book than this!!! You have got to read the Giver at least once in your life!

B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein is possibly the best industrial metal band ever!!!! I really like this album. Felt it was a new level for the band. Good sounding orchestration was a great additive to some of the tracks. This should please the Rammstein fans as well as pick up some fans along the way. Every track left me in awe, and I bought this only hearing Sonne (Which is an amazing song!) and I was happy to find out that all the songs were up to that caliber, meaning all the songs were amazing!<br /><br />  1. Mein Herz brennt 5/5<br /><br />  2. Links 234 5/5<br /><br />  3. Sonne 5/5 THE SINGLE!<br /><br />  4. Ich will 5/5<br /><br />  5. Feuer frei! 5/5<br /><br />  6. Mutter 5/5<br /><br />  7. Spieluhr 5/5<br /><br />  8. Zwitter 5/5<br /><br />  9. Rein raus 5/5<br /><br />  10. Adios 5/5<br /><br />  11. Nebel 5/5<br /><br />The new album of Rammstein will surprise many people around. These guys give a new meaning to the term extreme metal with their music. The music can be described as extreme metal with many different influences in it. The aggressive attitude is mixed with extreme metal and many melodic passages and the result is absolutely stunning. They have the ability to capture the attention of the listener and never let it go. I can't find not even one flaw at the album no matter how many times I hear it! There is no reason that a person with musical taste would not like the extraordinary album. A must buy!
B00005JMAH|2.0|How on earth anyone could think this was even half as good as the first two movies,let alone the best of the three is beyond me!                                                               Other reviewers have had their say about how different all the sets are, but for me the worst thing about this movie was that the director had this wealth of wonderful and experienced acting talent but apparently felt it  necessary to rely on cheesy special effects! From the opening, long-drawn out sequence with the inflatable aunt to the corny stop action ending by way of the cartoony bus-ride with the silly, shrunken head and later,the skinny werewolf, what was this guy thinking? Thankfully, Harry Potter 4 has a different director, who will, we can only hope, remain true to the books the way Chris Columbus did with the first two. Either way it can only be an improvement on this.                                           The only reason I gave this two stars is because of the presence of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and the rest of the cast - the movie itself only merits one star!
B000023VR6|5.0|U Can't Hate this man or his album! it really is a masterpiece. <br />i wish he cood tour australia with snoop!!! so they can show us some of their classix!! <br />he is stilla Ni**a wit an attitude! <br />Fav Songs : Still Dre, The Watcher, Housewife, Xxplosive, the Next Episode, seriosly its the whole album really. <br /> <br />U Can't F*ck wit Dre Day!
B000003TBP|5.0|bob dylan himself said that everyone rips off but just rip off something good. this record doesn't sound weird to me. it sounds modern. anyone who says it's a ripoff of old music is a moron. yeah. lots of people rapped over harmonicas xylophones tubas acoustic guitars and drum machines in 1974. every six months nowadays i put this record in and get a twelve pack. I got plastic on my mind....
B00005AQF7|5.0|Big Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle!! is easily 1 of the my FAV albums of all time!!!!! everysingle song on this is A class material! <br />i will never ever get sick of this album!!!! <br />but i do have a favourite song which is.....Ain't No Fun!!!!!!! <br /> <br />if for some reason u dont have this album!!!! u really shood go and get it!!!!! it is worth every cent!! <br />u gotta luv snoop! even though he'z changed <br />
0060589272|5.0|This was my first book by Paulo Coelho. A friend let me borrow his copy and so I really had no expectations. <br /> <br />Mr. Coelho's writing, in this book, moves along very smoothly and I never once was bored. <br /> <br />The story is not about a prostitue, though that is what the main character does for a living. The story is about making choices, about searching for love and refusing to search for love. This story is about taking risks, some calculated, some spontaneous. <br /> <br />In the end love does indeed conquer all reason because it is the only reason. Why run away from love just because it hurts sometimes. The pleasure is worth the pain.  <br /> <br />At the end of this book I felt very encouraged and happy. Yes, there was a happy ending, though the plot was not exactly predictable. Either way it was a very good book and I recommend it to anyone.
B00003CXCT|3.0|But personally I can't see buying a whole new set unless the special features are what draws you to it. <br /> <br />I'm an old Star Wars fan.  I still have my 20 year old VideoDisc player, which works (for those who remember them) and have the original trilogy which I still watch time to time.  Color and sound are still terrific, even flipping them over halfway through, and changing discs, but you'd not expect less from the first precursor to today's DVDs. <br /> <br />Like many, I got the Special Editions on VHS when they came out, and some of the changes were welcome, some weren't.   <br />But no movie and update is going to be perfect.  It's personal choice.  I'd take the trilogy as a gift when the original versions come out on DVD, but I won't buy another set like this, not when there's so many versions out on tape and DVD already. <br /> <br />I'd suggest getting this set if you haven't bought any of the movies in say, 10 years.  But if you're a longtime fan who's kept up your library of Star Wars, unless the Special features is enough for you to plunk down the extra, it'll just be another set gathering dust on the shelf, like my three different sets, two VHS, one Videodisc. <br /> <br />Ahhh, now to just look forward to the full Sextet releases in a couple years.  the Original Sextet, the Special Edition Sextet, the Definitive Sextet, and the I Can't Do Anything More To These So We'll Throw Everything Into the Set Set <br /> <br />Gotta admit, as much fun as the original Trilogy was. . . they know how to run a cash cow.

0140277447|5.0|I learned a lot in detail about the most inhuman holocuast committed by Japanese troop in Nanking City during World War II from this book. IMHO, it is a book that tells you some real truth about WWII.
B00005JNDX|1.0|If there was a worse film released in 2004 than Bridget Jones Mark II then I'm glad I didn't see it.  After watching this execrable dross it dawned on me that I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life that I won't be getting back.<br /><br />Yet, perhaps it was just me?  Much of the audience did laugh from time to time at the often slap stick humour.  I just found it predictable and tired.<br /><br />The original film of 2001 was fresh and at sometimes amusing.  This sequel, however,  showed that you can only get so much out of the one idea.  Bridget Jones had morphed into an absurd caricature.  She even gets stuck in a Thai jail on a drugs charge!  What's more, the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu when her two suitors are involved in another fight is palpable.  It just wasn't funny!<br /><br />If you're even just thinking of seeing this film, don't waste your time!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|If you want a CD with a singer who you can feel the energy coming from, with exxxcelent guitar riffs, kinda like In Flames, but not limited to only one sound.  With one of the best drummers in music today, buy this CD.  The worst track to me on this CD is the very first one.  So skip that one and start on number two.  You will love it.  MY personal favorite tracks are \\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\" and \\"Zombie Autopilot.\\" <br /> <br />The only thing this album doesnt have is one single genre of music to put them into.  They are in no way \\"posers\\" they just like the sound that they are putting out.  If you don't like the CD then you just dont like this one type of music.  That doesn't mean this band isn't good.  I would say this is my favorite band besides \\"Into Eternity.\\"  BTW if you like this CD buy \\"buried in oblivion\\" by Into Eternity.  Slightly more powerful, but awesome.
B00020HEL6|4.0|Yep I know she's actually 15 now, but she was 14 when the album was recorded. I am a hardcore Metal/Rock/80's Pop listener and even I have to say that this chick is incredible. She has the habit common to any newly-minted teenage singer trying to be taken seriously: she tends to add just a bit too much dramatic flair to some of her vocals. She'll mature eventually. That sounds odd considering she already \\"sounds\\" more mature than people her parents age. Though she handles the old standards extremely well, I think that there can't be that much of an audience for this type of music. I mean, the World War II generation is dying off. With her vocal range I think she could greatly expand her fan base if she pulled a \\"Shania\\" and went Pop Country. Also, why hasn't this chick recorded a Christmas album yet? There is a plethora of Bing Crosby tunes screaming for her attention.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is the best System of a Down album out there, and a definite must-buy if your into hard rock. Although I could safely say that its over 50% screaming by Serj, all that songs are all distinct, and each has its own different feel to it. A rundown of the songs: <br />1. Suite-Pee - Banger to start out, Serj saying some random stuff about tripping out to some sort of drug. Very nice instrumentals to start out the song. 9/10 <br />2. Know - Decent song, but probably the one I skip the most. Just doesn't really have a distinct feel to it, I guess. 6.5/10 <br />3. Sugar - Just a fun song about the Kombucho Mushroom People. Very strong. 8.5/10 <br />4. Suggestions - I love how this track starts out relatively soft, then immediately changes into a more SOADy, hard track. 9/10 <br />5. Spiders - One of my many favorites, very soft, with a gradual climb to an emotional end. 3rd best song on the album. 9.5/10 <br />6. Ddevil - Silly little song in between two of the stronger songs. Nice weaving of the guitar and drum in the middle of the song. 7/10 <br />7. Soil - The best song on the album. Very good job in mixing all the various musical elements in creating a powerful song, with the catchy chorus of \\"Don't You/Realize/That Evil/Lives in the Motherf------ Skin.\\" The band at its best. 10/10 <br />8. War? - Good song, with a hardcore start, a fadeoff, and then the a crescendo to the end where the beginning is repeated. 9/10 <br />9. Mind - Strangest song on the album. Very soft beginning, with sudden drums and vocals. Then the main part of the song goes on, with strange vocals and even stranger sounds/noises, and towards the end of the song, the beginning comes back, with the words \\"look at each other\\". Hard to get used to, but one of the better tracks on the album. 8.5/10 <br />10. Peephole - Strange circus-like feel to the song. Also a very weird beginning, with the first part of the song containing a very low volume version of the main chorus of the song. Interesting anddifferent sound to it though. 9/10 <br />11. CUBErt - Great introductory guitar piece, with some non-sensical lyrics from Serj (as usual), but it works for another sub-2 minute song, the second on the album. 7.5/10 <br />12. Darts - My second favorite song on the album. Nice, heavy start to the song, with sudden shifts in the tempo and direction of the song. There are about 5 different times when the song goes from hard to soft and back again, and with \\"interesting\\" lyrics (mostly screaming). 9.5/10 <br />13. P.L.U.C.K. - Probably the most meaningful track on the album, about the Armenian genocide. Despite being personal, it really doesn't feel all that distinct and different. Works as a nice closer to the album though, and its still rather interesting. 8/10 <br />Overall, a very strong debut album, and their best work to date. Definitely worth a buy if you're a SOAD fan, or like the genre in general.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is has to be the best cd I own. She is a wonderful talent. Kick back and listen to the relaxing sound of Norah Jones.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I really loved the Matrix.  Smart, movie that caught you off guard.  But Matrix Reloaded should have been labelled Matrix Re-bloated.  It was silly, pretentious and basically laughable in spots.  Neo goes Superman.  Blah!  And yes, I really gave it several chances to see if it would improve.   <br /> <br />So I held off with this final installment - 2 installments too any.  Bigger is not better, it's just more of the same overblown mess than Reloaded was.  Trinity's death scene was bland, failing to move me.  It was so much special effects, and some quite funny.   <br /> <br />Wave bye bye Neo...thankfully!!  This movie series will go down in the history of film as how NOT to make a sequel and a sequel's sequel.
B00068IOWM|1.0|Another comercial and safe hype,that's this \\"new\\" album.All That You Can't Leave Behind was the first part of this album.Now we have more distorded guitars, but in the end is pretty the same comercial intended kind of albums. So now we'll have to wait until 2008 for more of the same. 2 bad albums and you're out, someone said... therefore U2 is out.U2 has become the most overrated classic band, every new song is received with devotion,w ith bowing, screams, caps down, etc, but just for think, which was the last truly great and unforgettable song? Staring At The Sun or Please, from Pop...7 years ago. Even some fans say Stay,from Zooropa...11 years ago.  <br />The band looks and sound tired, Bono looks and sound awful both with his long hair and rough voice. The band plays boring,with such lack of ideas that's something to worry about. Like a fan said recently, \\"while there're many younger bands who can't sell half of any U2 record (Radiohead, Coldplay, Travis, Keane, etc) these old men can sell easily 10 millions with any crap,just because they're U2, a big music company. A shame, really shame\\".  <br />Overall the album sounds flat, and producers didn't make any great job here, given the songs don't go anywhere, both sonically and musically. <br />This album should have been just an EP containing: <br /> <br />1- City Of Blinding Lights <br />2- All Because Of You <br />3- Miracle Drug <br />4- Crumbs For Your Table <br /> <br />all the rest of the album is simply nothing.They're so obsessed in composing \\"the best album from all times\\" ( now just an stupid and repetitive Bono's cliche ) than they forget how to make A WHOLE ALBUM, not just separate songs put togheter in a decent tracklisting. A great album is something you have to experience as a whole, not skipping any track. But here you can easily skip 5 songs from this record, including the tuneless Vertigo, one of their worst compositions. U2 now think their albums too much calculate, and they forget the main thing: make music, no snappy craps, no big comercial marketing, no big hypes. Nobody believe in Bono anymore with his same words again and again before every new album after Pop \\"this record is our best collection of songs ever\\". They don't sound naturally here, no mention to hoarse Bono's vocals and the same ( now boring ) Edge guitars he has used on ATYCLB. I'm sure most of reviews are paid by their management, because is pretty weird to see many fans disapointed by this album while the press caps down with this average album. U2 now keep stand at the top because of their extraordinary 80's and 90's albums, when the band wasn't obsessed with more and more awards and \\"their best album ever\\".  <br /> <br />It's time to go home, really U2.
B0002S94OS|5.0|this is lamb of god everyone..not some metla band straight out of europe. this album is great to all the curious. sure..songs do coalesce with each other if not carefully listened too...but..AOTW does offer alot with songs such as \\"hourglass\\",\\"the faded line\\", and \\"what ive become\\". even the title tracks \\"ashes of the wake\\" will please all the guitar virtuosos out there. This album may not be as crazy as other metal albums ive heard...but what it comes down to is if this album is good or bad. great drums by far as in \\"blood of the scribe\\"..but the vocals are decent and unique..the guitars play great riffs...and even the song writing structure is well mixed up.  I read from someone above that these guys suck compared to children of bodom.  the fact is that these guys arent children of bodom, killswitch, unearth, mastodon, slayer. they dont even rely on all the overcliched slayer riffs that can be found in many metal bands. these guys are lamb of god...n the album shows enough that they are respectable and stand out. Even children of bodom (if you wanna hear metal listen to kalmah..they are better than bodom) gets lame after a while compared to this album because their song struture is almost always the same (intro verse chorus verse chorus solo chorus outro) whereas AOTW serves up variety in \\"the faded line.\\" for all the curious out there..listen to \\"the faded line\\" and make ur own decision...not what the metal-only-comes-from-finland- ppl say.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|This is da greatest collection of pop music I've ever seen!  Forget about that crappy Now series, buy The Wretched Spawn today!  You'll be brought to tears by George Fischer's heavenly tenor singing. Sounds almost as good as Justin Timberlake, who as we all know, George took lessons from back on the No Strings Attached tour when he was their roadie.  Some people call this a metal album, but I consider that disrespectful and rude.  Metal is something that's satanic, evil and loud.  Cannibal Corpse couldn't be further from that. Nothing but happy riffs, soft drumming and overall just a nice, soothing mellow sound. The lyrics are touching stories that will make you feel empathy toward humanity.  My personal favorite is Severed Head Stoning, which is a moving song about not giving up on your dreams featuring guest guitarist John Mayer. Also another great song is they deserve to die, which features special guest vocalists Hootie and Fred Durst.  Overall, Cannibal Corpse is the best boy band since the Backstreet Boys and I would bet they will be on TRL before the end of the year, which as we all know, is the greatest show on earth.
B00003CWL6|1.0|This film is hard to believe. Although it is well-made and generally sustains interest, it's message is poisonous.<br /><br />The \\"hero\\" is a teenage drug peddler. He sees artistic beauty in things like a corpse with its brains blown out.<br /><br />A neighborhood gay couple is portrayed as blissful and well-adjusted; by comparison the two heterosexual couples are miserable and dysfunctional. One heterosexual father quits his job during his midlife crisis and starts an affair with a high school cheerleader (!!); the other hetero father is a sadistic control-freak. One heterosexual mother is a materialistic adulterous, the other a zombie. Their kids are lost.<br /><br />It is revealed that the reason the one father is such an abusive hate-monger is because he denied his homosexual tendencies all his life.<br /><br />The overall message of the film rings loud and clear: Embrace homosexuality and you'll be happy, have a normal family and you'll be miserable.<br /><br />If you're a homosexual and want encouragement for your chosen lifestyle, then pick up this flick. All others should avoid like the plague.
B0006213H6|4.0|The casual fans might as well not buy this, because you'll probably complain how it doesn't sound like \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\" and the ambient filler will probably bore you to death.  And then I'll have to read some review about how it wasn't \\"like that song on 'Vanilla Sky'\\" and how you wasted your money.  Well, let me do you a favor by not wasting your money, and let me do myself a favor by not reading some inanely stupid review. <br /> <br />No, this is not a new Sigur Rs album; it is their debut album finally being released in the U.S.  The most memorable songs are \\"Hun Jord,\\" \\"Myrkur,\\" and \\"Von,\\" with \\"Syndir Gufs\\" being a good runner up.  The rest are--and were intended to be--ambient filler.  It sounds like they took an EP's worth of material and expanded it out to be a full album.  It's still good, though, as I enjoy Sigur Rs' ambient collection, and I think this album is well worth checking out for serious fans.  For everyone else, if you buy it, just keep things into perspective:  this is nothing like their last two studio albums.
6303421563|4.0|Take away the elaborately staged shoot 'em ups and the spilled blood and the rest of the mayhem, and what we have here is a love story, of sorts.<br /><br />Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read.  He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets.  Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a \\"cleaner\\" so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother.  Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.<br /><br />Okay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style.  After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial.  (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.)  After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.<br /><br />What French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original  La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment.  He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some \\"cute\\" shots of his very pretty little star.  One wants to ask, \\"What's a nice Jewish girl [Portman was born in Israel] like you doing in a movie like this?\\"<br /><br />What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot.  Some highlights:<br /><br />The scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, \\"He's not my father.  He's my lover.\\" (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)<br /><br />Reno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).<br /><br />Stansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills.  In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, \\"This is from Mathilda\\" as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand...  (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review!  Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)<br /><br />One last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!<br /><br />Okay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.<br />What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot.

B000002540|5.0|Though 30 years hence, \\"On Your Feet, Or On Your Knees\\", continues to be regaled as rocks finest live recording. It sure is. Blue Oyster Cult produced a three part symphony of evil in the early 1970s, and wrapped it up in this live coda. Cemetary rock with an industrial flare and stoned out crowd, this live recording has the feel of being present at the concert. And as many others have already noted, I'd like to echo the sentiment that this is probably the only live recording inwhere the songs actually sound tighter and more disciplined than on the original studio celebrations. I attended my first of 20 or so Blue Oyster Cult shows several hours before I was born and so help me God, I remember it! La dolce vita!
B00028HBKC|5.0|When I had first popped this into my DVD player, I had a fairly good knowledge of what events I was going to see. I had no idea on how in depth Mel went into it. The movie was in fact word for word of what really happend. The acting was teriffic. The actors really convince the audience of what is going on. And of course the directing was great. Mel did add a little with what I thought was the anti-christ when satan was holding that little child. And yes, Jesus did suffer that much. He was not killed from the suffering because the bible says that \\"no man will kill me, but I will yeild my spirit.\\" So in all, the movie was great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|The strokes have ripped out the skeleton of bands like television and the velvet underground and given it a cute little bow tie and are now selling it back to a new generation. The music on Room on Fire is delivered in the laziest and most apathetic fashion possible because thats what's perceived as \\"kewl\\" these days. The lo fi production is truly an ingenius gimmick because they're not only saving money in the studio but also marketing it as trendy and fashionable. This music may be more tolerable than britney but it's still the same in principle.
B000003B6J|3.0|If this was 1989, when I heard this album, I would have given it one star.  That's because the lyrics were so over the top, the music was so far ahead of anything and offensive in most cases.  But this group NWA is from the streets of Compton in California, and they strongly addressed the ills of their community on that album.  It spawned Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, DJ Yella, and the dynamic raps of MC Ren.  The music sounded muddy with the basslines and Dr. Dre should be commended for having some funky sounds within those songs on one of the first albums he produced. This album might have set the tone for the hits he's had for numerous artists the past 15 years, even up to Eminem.  But their anti-police song, while shocking, addressed police brutality long before the Rodney King incident later one.  And while no one should ever say that to law enforcement, this group never held back.  Ice Cube and Mc Ren were the strongest rappers on this album. Eazy lets the sexual lyrics go into overdrive as he macks to the ladies, and Dr. Dre is so-so with his raps with his boasting. DJ Yella had some slamming scratches and samples to match with the group. On the one song where they don't curse at all, Express Yourself, they show their more positive side where people have to stand up for what they believe in. The '91 album was a much better album, but Compton some uneven joints within its pace. In 2004, I have upgraded it to 3 stars because the record thematically holds up very strongly. NWA helped put West Coast rap on the map and they could do gangsta rap better than anyone!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I Like this movie I finally saw it I laughed threw it alot of funny moments to it and I say its one of the best animated movies ever made.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Most movies follow a simple rule.  Goodness may only lose temporarily, and evil may never win.  Movies like Mystic River, which break the rule, can be brilliant or disturbing.    In the opening scene, three boys are playing street hockey.  A stranger impersonating a cop orders one of them into a car. The other two watch helplessly as their friend is abducted.      The movie then joins the three in adulthood: abduction victim Dave (Tim Robbins), ex-con turned family man Jimmy (Sean Penn), and detective Sean (Kevin Bacon).  How will the three characters, past and present, fit together?  We expect friendship, but that clich is quickly trampled.  When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, the childhood bond isn't so strong that Sean and his partner can't investigate.  And while Dave still lives in the neighborhood, he's a suspect preoccupied with his own problems.  Friendship seems to have died the day of the abduction, so these guys might do anything to each other.    Mystic River inhabits a real, day-to-day universe.  Characters make off-task remarks and struggle to find the right words.  That makes the tragic scenes all the more disturbing: the body at the murder site, the father's anguish, the body at the morgue, the body at the funeral home . . . enough with the body!  I wanted to leave at that point, but the mystery drew me in.  Not the whodunit kind of mystery, for the detectives are sharp and evidence is everywhere.  The mystery of how and when the pieces will come together.    Other clichs and assumptions get trampled along the way.  We're unsure who to grieve or cheer for.  Victims can hide their own misdeeds.  Good guys can hide the truth.    Everything seems so real.  What better complement can be paid to the acting?  A few moments of going overboard perhaps challenge the reality effect.  Jimmy's anguish could use an occasional interruption, and Michael's suspicious wife is too blatant at times.  But those are imperfections of script, not acting.    If you believein the evil/goodness rule, you might not like the ending.  Mystic River is true to its own rules, and consistent with its own universe.  The pieces fit together in a way that is brilliant and disturbing.
B00005RDSM|5.0|The children in the Darling family love story about Peter Pan.  So naturally when he shows up one night looking for his missing shadow, they're thrilled to go back with him to Never Land.  There, they face Indians and \\"the world's most famous crook,\\" Captain Hook.  Will they survive their adventures with the boy who never wants to grow up?<br /><br />I have always had a fascination with this story.  As a kid I remember checking the Disney picture book version out of the library week after week.  When I finally got to see it, I was enthralled.  There is just something magical about the story.  It's partially the coming together of all the boyhood adventures in one place.  Mermaids, Indians, and Pirates?  What more could any boy want?  And, of course, the ability to fly.  The \\"You can fly\\" sequence over London is one of my all time favorites.  The whole movie really is animated very well with a story that movies quickly from place to place with lots of humor to keep everyone entertained and gorgeous animation of the fanciful Never Land.<br /><br />This special edition is worth tracking down.  The picture (original full frame) is sharp and the surround sound is very nice.  Extras include a documentary on the making of the movie and a promotional theatrical featurette from the original release.  The \\"audio commentary\\" is unique.  Hosted by Roy Disney, it consists of selections from interviews of the voice talent, live action models, animators, and animation historians.  While not your usual commentary, it's fascinating stuff and well worth a listen.  Finally, there's a treasure hunt game and DVD storybook for kids.<br /><br />This movie still brings a smile to my face and probably always will.  Maybe my friends are right when they say I love this movie so much because I always wanted to be Peter Pan.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I can't believe how much Carrie Fisher sounds like Margot Kidder nowadays.  Anyway, the original Star Wars Trilogy (sort of) is finally on DVD.  Yes, these are the Special Editions (sort of).  Even more changes have been made here.  I consider myself a moderate Star Wars fan: I enjoy the films and the video games, and I still collect some of the action figures, but I don't read all the books, sleep on Star Wars sheets, dress up like characters from the films, or anything like that.  There was a time when I was younger that I would've been very much against the idea of altering these films, but now that I'm older I feel that Lucas should be able to (for better or worse) modify his films (he would say \\"complete\\" them), but I also think the originals should be available for those who fell in love with them back in the day. <br /> <br />Anyway, on to the films.  They look and sound great, and most of the changes don't alter the films in a negative way.  I like the addition of the Jabba scene in the original Star Wars, and they've improved the CGI to make him look more like he does in Episode I.  Unfortunately however, Greedo still shoots first in this version, and even though it's been improved a bit, it still looks bad, and still changes the story for the worse (in my opinion).  This is my single least favorite change in the whole trilogy. <br /> <br />One other change that has some fans angry is the substitution of Hayden Christensen at the end of Return Of The Jedi: now, instead of seeing the spirit of an older Anakin, we see young Anakin...looking kind of creepy no less (though it would explain why old Anakin's body doesn't disappear when he dies if it was young Anakin who became one with the force). <br /> <br />At any rate, this is a great set, and the bonus disc has (among other things) a great documentary on the making of the trilogy that will surprise a lot of long-time fans. <br /> <br />I recommend this DVD set, though hopefully someday the original versionsof these films will be released for those who want them.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|In the 1940s Universal Studios attempted to re-energize horror films at the box office by churning out movies that crammed as many famous monsters into the plot line as possible.  The result was usually more notable for being silly than effective, and in spite of its highly touted CGI effects VAN HELSING is sillier still.<br /><br />Suggested by the vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA, the film presents a young and sexy Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is in the employ of a secret sect of the Roman Catholic Church run along James Bond lines.  After a little run in with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvannia along with a trusty Friar as sidekick.  There they promptly meet a sexy vampire hunting gypsy princess, and the three promptly encounter the Wolf Man, the Frankestein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's Brides, and even Dracula's Babies.  Who would have thunk it?<br /><br />The CGI effects are impressive and the occasional hommages to the original Universal Studio horror films of the 1930s and 1940s are occasionally amusing--but the whole thing very quickly collapses into a lot of visual and audio noise, and there isn't much to hold it together.  After about half an hour I began to use the fast forward button on my remote a lot.  It's a case of the director, actors, and special effects people having more fun than the audience.<br /><br />The transfer is quite good, although to my eye CGI effects do not work as well on the home screen as they do on the big screen.  There are also a handful of bonuses, none of which are greatly interesting or particularly well done.  Final take: this a movie that seems to be made by and for a bunch of hyperactive fourteen year old boys without a whole lot of imagination.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|this record's not bad- but doesn't live up to all they hype. The songs are catchy enough but only slightly funky.  At times the grooves are strong but there are no killer lyrics and hooks to match it. The front man is cute and that helps.  <br />I think the band has promise and will be worth following to see what they put out next.  If you like guitar- funky -european music this record will do the trick.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Excellent...  Amost every \\"guitar\\" player who is a \\"guitar\\" player is here.  Clean video and an excellent DTS soundtrack.  This is not just about Clapton - it's everybody.  A must buy...
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I was also fortunate enough to be at this concert in person on Sunday, the final day.  There were three songs that day that totally blew me, and ALL of them were omitted from this DVD: <br /> <br />1) The opening National Anthem, with Neal Schon on lead guitar and the popular Randy Jackson on bass... my guess is that this was omitted because there was a time at the end of the song when something happened to the mikes or the drum set, and they only played the cymbals for about 5 minutes, but that came at the very end of the anthem, so it could have easily been faded out <br /> <br />2) Jeff Beck... he only played ONE song in this concert (Cause We Ended As Lovers) because they were running short on time and the rain was approaching, but it was definitely one of the best songs of the entire event. <br /> <br />3) BB King / Buddy Guy / John Mayer / Eric Clapton combo.  I think they could put out a whole DVD for just the one hour BB King set.  When BB was trading licks with Buddy Guy, Mayer and Clapton (with Vaughn butting in here and there), that was possibly the best concert experience of my lifetime. Every few minutes, another guitar superstar would pull up a folding chair and start cranking.  Sure, there were a lot of screw ups during the set, but the free-form trading of licks between these huge guitar legends should not have been left off. One BB King song... but two from Vince Gill and JJ Cale? What were they thinking??? <br /> <br />Anyway, other than that, I am EXTREMELY impressed with both the audio and video quality of this DVD. I just hope they put out a DISK 3 sometime with the rest of the good songs.
B000009EAD|5.0|All I'm going to say is, if you like metal music and you haven't heard these guys or have and don't like them, you need help.<br /><br />They continue to improve with each release and this cd is no exception to that rule. It's all hear, riffage out the ying yang, great melodies, fantastic vocals, solid rhythm section, it just plain kicks ass. I love the opening riffs of Burning Times and it just gets better after that.<br /><br />This cd rocks!!
B00005T30L|2.0|Okay, so Thora Birch is hot in this movie and Steve Buscemi is the man in anything he does.  But this one just didn't do it for me.  It had a few funny parts.  I wanted to see more of the weird guy at the convenient store with the numchucks - though he kinda reminds me of Stifler from American Pie.  I like the girls Daria attitudes and such, and their retarded graduation concert thing was a riot, but the movie in it's entirety just had nothing really going for it. <br />Kick ass tune in the beginning though, nothing I've ever heard of before.
B00005JA2B|5.0|If you're into classic progressive hard rock?, this is a cd you must have in your collection. It totally rocks from start to finish. Kansas is a great band period!! These guys know how to play their instruments (White Stripes and countless other bands are you listening!!) and it shows up in spades. What fantastic musicianship these guys had. The songs are truly masterpieces and take you on a ride that is absolutely enjoyable. Kansas deserves a better fate in rock music history as they were a great band, no if ands or buts!!
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy is a very good sequel to the Bourne Identity. Like the first movie the film moves briskly through a series of action scenes. What elevates the two movies is the strength of the lead character Jason Bourne played well by Matt Damon. Jason is an interesting character because unlike so many action characters that strut across the screen with arrogance and mindless run into crazy situations saying corny one liners, Jason Bourne thinks. Matt Damon displays the lead character's uncanny ability to calmly think and plan his way out of a situation; he's never arrogant and he never grand stands. This makes this character more real and gives the circumstances in the movie more credibility than a normal run of the mill action movie. <br /> <br />The reason why this sequel (and perhaps the third movie) is so good can be attributed to the basis of which these films were made, a pre-existing book series. This character wasn't revived to build a film franchise with a bunch of hack screenwriters just trying to make money. The story and character have a strong background already built in. Which was particularly important for Bourne Supremacy, because the action scenes were very hard to watch. The camera moves and cuts so much it's nauseating to watch. And even if you can stomach the movement it is hard to figure out what on earth is happening. This film could be the only action film I can think of where the film excelled despite it's action scenes.  <br /> <br />My hope is to end the franchise with a solid third film based on the books. Hopefully they will decide to get a team together that can film both drama and action for the last go around.   <br />
B000002HFU|5.0|Yesterday, the world lost one of it's best rap talents, straight from Staten Island, reppin' the Wu-Tang Clan.  ODB, you will be missed dearly.  This album, the 2nd solo-album to come from the Wu-Tang Clan, gives an insight of the Ol' Dirty back in the day, containing great tracks such as \\"Brooklyn Zoo\\", \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ya\\", and one of my personal favorites, \\"Raw Hide\\" featuring Raekwon and Method Man.  The RZA beats are here too making this one great album to remember ODB by along with his second solo cut, \\"N**** Please\\".<br /><br />RIP ODB.  He will always be remembered as one of the most unique personalities in rap music.  May he rest in peace.

B00012QM8G|5.0|It is rare for a craft or a form of art be taken to its utmost potential. Limits are easily reached in any discipline or pursuit, but to take it to its highest potential is rare and commendable. Schindler's List is one of those rare works. It is the account of millions of lives woven into one story, if that is possible. This is certainly that attempt, and it is a noble and courageous one.

079073804X|5.0|Some films you watch on a friend's DVD players, some you rent from the video store and others you make an effort to own. This is one any collector of classic films must own. Even if the horror genre has never appealed to your tastes, buy this movie for it transcends categories.  Although it had a cult following in the early 1970s, this is no cult film, twisted and demented for someone's narrow agenda. If you are literary minded and fret about its faithfulness to the bestselling novel, put those fears to rest for Blatty wrote the screenplay. If, on the other hand, you tend to shy away from films with religious motifs, rest assured (but uneasy for other reasons) that this film does not need to proselytize to make its point. It is compelling on its own account. And if you saw it decades ago and can't recall whether it was merely a dark fantasy of youth, you will find your first impressions were indeed deep and remain so. The Exorcist forces the reader to confront evil in its rawest reincarnation and to wonder, at the very least, whether the demonic possession of a girl could really have been satanic.  As one who was raised strict Catholic, and who is very familiar with the actual incident upon which this film is loosely based, I must admit to a considerable bias in assessing its merits. But any Christian or non-Christian who believes in God and the palpable existence of his fallen angel, Satan, will find this film profoundly disturbing and at the same time spiritually uplifting.
0316776963|2.0|After hearing much raving about Sedaris I looked forward to reading this book. The first chapter made me laugh out loud but it was downhill from there. I found it disjointed, rude and often crude and had to work hard to finish the book.  Very disappointing.
B000089RVX|1.0|This self obsessed voclaist, Amy Lee ranks amongst my least favourite artists. I saw an interview with her on MTV and she irritated me immensely with her laid back arrogance, strive to look like 'she doesn't give a damn' when in fact she really does. Her attempt to look hippie, scrappy, poor, when in fact she's rolling in money, has a rather posh English accent, comes accross as arrogantly educated, and is obviously no hippie is horrid. She claims 'music is easy, it's just something I do' - f**k right off. Arrogance doesn't bring you fans, you may well be a talented composer, but we don't want to hear outrageous comments about how good you are. Please be quiet.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This DVD set recorded a memorable event. It's final release will trigger a lot of youth sediments in people who grew up in the 80's like me, and that should be a very good reason for people to have to own this DVD set, in addition to the fact that the proceeds will go to charity as well. Same as others, I do miss of a lot of artists/sessions which are left out. But what I really want to say is: don't forget to read the excellent sleeve notes that come with this DVD. They tell us what Live Aid really is in the bigger context of world injustice. They tell us why Live Aid did not solve the problem of Third World poverty, and how Bob Geldof has taken on a journey from charity to justice after the event. They also hinted why another Live Aid has not occurred in almost two decades. I feel that these issues are far more important than why certain artist is or is not included in this DVD (which is also explained in the notes if one needs to know why). And teenagers in the 80's should now be mature enough to have realized the deeper meaning of this historical event, just as Bob Geldof has.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie has all the great elements...... great love story, you'll laugh, cry, cringe & rejoice.  Five stars definitely
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I thought this was the best movie by far that I have seen in a very long time. I thought it was visually, stunning and the story line was just incredible. I want this movie for my collection very badly!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If - by the end of this movie - you haven't fallen in love with Napoleon you are either too old, too young, or simply do not have a heart...and my own is certainly not bleeding. <br /> <br />You will identify, laugh, cry, ponder -  all to some degreee. <br /> <br />Introduce (or reintroduce) yourself to the geek that lives inside you.
0385335482|4.0|Sophie Kinsella used to write about finance--as you'll soon realize reading \\"Shopaholic.\\" The book is basically a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" cautionary tale about spending beyond your means. None of the characters really come to life and the plot is so stressful your heart rate will jump at times. But \\"Shopaholic\\" was a wake-up call for this reader about some of the mental strategies we all use to justify unnecessary shopping. Should be required reading for all single women!
B00005JMX6|5.0|There are plently of highschool movies outthere(Ex. OldSchool,  Porky's,Animal House)but they all lack one thing,STORY LINE!!!  This movie has one of the best storys ive seen in a while.  It actully isnt all about the T&A in this movie. It's about a kid that will do anything for the girl he loves.  Yes it did remind me of Risky Business, but i thought that it was a little more fun,whereas Risky Business was more serious. Watch this movie, ITS GREAT!!!!!!
0312995423|3.0|Dan Brown once again shows his skill at crafting page-turners in \\"Digital Fortress\\" but once again also illustrates how he can't create a decent character to save his life. The writing is servicable and the plot this time is quite compelling--an unbreakable code that threatens government surviellance of the Internet. He also nicely summarizes some of the arguments AGAINST government surveillance of the Internet, and adds some nice plot twists and action sequences. Better than run-of-the-mill Crichton, but if Brown would take some writing classes, it could actually be good.
0156027321|4.0|Like most great books, \\"Life of Pi\\" plays out like a slow-moving daydream. For the most part it is subtle and not much seems to happen, but underneath there is much that it is moving and memorable. Around the middle section I became afraid that the book was trailing off and going nowhere, but by the end the book proves fulfilling and full of memorable moments.
B00024I2Z4|4.0|I loved Mulan. The little Asian family jokes were hilarious! Frying dumplings over an open fire with chopsticks. Ingenious. The little details of humor are what made this movie so much fun to watch. I'm glad the main story line wasn't about love. A nice relief of traditional animated movies (Pocohantas, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc...), though I've always loved Disney movies. Q: the dog's name is little brother, is that just a translation from the chinese word for little brother? <br />
0141439513|5.0|I do not often find myself reading female authors, but when I do, it is always in the classics. Jane Austen is deserved known as one of the best. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is witty and memorable. I need not say more. I cannot see how this brilliant work could do anything but polarise opinion, there is no middle ground.
B00000K19E|5.0|I am a big fan of this movie...unfortunately as the sequels came out it progressively went downhill, yet still enjoyable.  I was always amazed at what an original idea this was until I watched the Japanese anime film \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" from 1995 (the manga [jap. comic] came out in 1989?).  There are so many similarities taken from \\"Ghost...\\" even down to the fast trickling green code writing and the head connectors to \\"plug in\\" to the net.  Still a great movie though but not an original masterpiece that I thought.  Everyone should see \\"Ghost in the Shell\\".  Ghost # 2 is coming on DVD in December and I'm looking forward to it.
0140277447|5.0|this article explains some of the absurd reviews on this board: <br /> <br />NANKING MASSACRE -- THE JAPANESE VERSIONS <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />From 1937 to now (1990), the Japanese militarists, the government and the public dealt with the undeniable atrocities committed by the Japanese troops in Nanking and the rest of Asia in a number of ways. The major waves of Japanese treatment of this dark historical tragedy ranged from total cover-up during the war, confessions and documentation by the Japanese soldiers during the 1950's and 60's, denial of the extent of the Nanking Massacre during the 70's and 80's, official distortion and rewriting of history during the 80's, and total denial of the occurrence of the Nanking Massacre by government officials in 1990.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />(I) DURING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SINO-JAPANESE WAR <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />The Japanese Government had a tight control over the news media during the War and the Japanese civilians did not know about the truth of the Nanking Massacre or other crimes committed by the Japanese troops abroad. In fact, the Japanese soldiers were always described as heroes. It was not until the postwar Tokyo Trial (tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East) that the truth of the Nanking Massacre was first revealed to the Japanese civilians. The atrocities revealed during the Trial shocked the Japanese society at the time.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />(II) POSTWAR TO 1970's <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />Prior to 1970, there was no open denial by the Japanese regarding the Nanking Massacre. In fact, there were a number of Japanese books, many were confessions or diaries by Japanese soldiers, which confirmed and gave detailed accounts of the Massacre. Works by the Japanese documenting the Nanking Massacre climaxed with the appearance of Katsuichi Honda's series of articles, \\"The Journey to China\\", published in Asahi Shinbun (Nov.,1971), which were based on interviews with the survivors of the Massacre. However, the Nanking Massacre was never emphasized in the Japanese history textbooks. During the Tokyo Trial, the Massacre was treated as one unique example of the atrocities committed in Asia, rather than as a separate charge. Few Japanese historians treated the Massacre as a serious research topic.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />(III) 1970 TO PRESENT <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />The denial of the Nanking Massacre started around 1972, when the right-wing political force in Japan began to rise. The Japanese denial of the Nanking Massacre and other brutalities in Asia can be divided into three broad categories:  <br /> <br />(a) Complete Denial of the Massacre  <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />By the end of 1971, the wave of confessions by Japanese soldiers and research by journalists exposing the brutal crimes in Asia encountered strong resistance from the right-wing conservatives. The denial movement began with two controversial yet influential articles: (1) an article by Shichihei Yamamoto, \\"Reply to Katsuichi Honda\\" published in Shokun!, March 1972; (2) an article by Akira Suzuki, \\"The Phantom of The Nanking Massacre\\", published in the April issue of the same Journal. This wave of open and public Japanese denial of their war crimes escalated over the years, as evidenced by Massaki Tanaka's book \\"Fabrication of Nanking Massacre\\" (Nihon Kyobun Sha, 1984) in which not only was the Nanking Massacre denied, but the Chinese Government was charged as responsible for the occurrence of the Sino-Japanese War.  <br /> <br />(b) Disputes on the Number of People Killed in the Massacre  <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />Besides total denial, another line of Japanese thoughts insisted that the Nanking Massacre was exaggerated by the Chinese. This view is best elaborated in a book written by Hata Ikuhiko \\"Nanking Incident\\" (Chuo Koron Shinsho, 1986) in which it was argued that the number of victims in the Massacre was between 38,000-42,000. It was also argued that the killing of surrendered or captured soldiers should NOT be considered as \\"Massacre\\". This book is now considered as the official history text on the issue by the Japan Ministry of Education.  <br /> <br />(c) Distortion and Rewriting of History  <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />In 1982, the Ministry of Education embarked on a campaign to distort the presentation of the history of World War II. In the process of the revision of history textbooks in Japan, Japanese \\"aggression\\" in China was substituted by \\"advancing in and out\\" of China during the Sino-Japanese War. The Nanking Massacre was described as a minor incident which occurred because the Japanese soldiers were too frustrated by the strong resistance from the Chinese Army. Although the substitution of the word \\"aggression\\" by \\"advancing in and out\\" was finally stopped because of the strong protest by the surrounding Asian countries and various Japanese educational groups, the rewriting of the Nanking Massacre remained. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has never admitted that the distortion of history is a mistake.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />(IV) 1990, DENIALS BY JAPANESE OFFICIALS <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />The Nanking Massacre came into focus again when an interview with Shintaro Ishihara, the most popular contemporary writer in Japan (co-author of \\"The Japan that Can Say No\\") and the most flamboyant member of the Diet, was published in the October issue of Playboy Magazine. In the interview, Ishihara declared that the Nanking Massacre never occurred, and that \\"it is a story made up by the Chinese, ... it is a lie\\". On November 10, 1990, during a protest by Chinese Americans against the Japanese actions in Diao-Yu-Tai Island, the Deputy Japanese Consul in Houston maintained that according to Japanese sources, \\"the Nanking Massacre never occurred.\\"  <br /> <br />[...]

I open and read the jacket blurb, and that's all it takes for me to grab it home with me. Of course, I stopped by the front desk and check it out first. What a fantastic read it is. You can not have a bad day if you are reading this book. If you're in the slump, pick this one up. Works like magic as an \\"upper\\"!
B000006045|5.0|That is what comes to mind when I think of this album. It is so beautifully dark and hypnotic and life altering. The songs are so perfect its as if they are not of this world.

B000003TAL|5.0|...should be barred from both listening and buying music, as they're likely to make bad purchases. :)  Ok, perhaps that's a bit extreme, but really, this is it.  This is your four years in high school, this is your life, this is your first girlfriend and your first car accident and the first time you picked up a guitar and all you could do was make random noises with it but still felt like it was cool.  Like you were on the brink of something.  Although this album came out when I was 4, I can still grasp its meaning.  It's timeless.  This album is about life on the brink of the point at which you truly start living.  The crux between \\"teenager\\" and \\"child\\", the confusion, the disorder, the optimism.  And yes, this album is just as incoherent as this review.  But that's what it's about.  Maybe this album means something to me because perhaps I'm still there, or maybe because I was so recently there.  But anyone who has been anywhere this album has, I'm sure you will enjoy it.  And we've all been there.

038551123X|4.0|I just finished Darkly Dreaming Dexter and feel definitely drained.  I can't remember the last time I've read a novel whose slide down from the climax didn't end exactly as I'd imagined.  I found myself reading the last few pages as rapidly as I'd read the first gruesomely delicious chapter.  I will admit that through the middle of the book, narrator Dexter's self-involved musings caused the flow to drag decidedly, but that's just dear demented Dexter.  Can't wait for the next novel featuring Dexter.  I want to see how he handles his protagonist Sergeant Doakes.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I am a huge fan of the work of director Tim Burton and have found something to redeem even his lesser work(Yes, \\"Mars Attacks!\\") with the exception of the misguided \\"Planet of the Apes\\" remake.  \\"Big Fish\\" is his most assured and mature work to date, if mature refers to a movie that contains giants, witches, and werewolves.  The film concerns the strained relationship between a dying Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) and his son Will(Billy Crudup).  The point of contention between the two seems to be the fabrications that the elder Bloom uses to relate about events of his life.  Edward Bloom clings to his dying breath to the truth of the tales he tells.  Young Will finds these stories disingenuous.  The film seems to come down on Edward's side in the sense that what is wrong with these minor digressions from reality when they make life that more interesting.  The acting in this film is superb.  Albert Finney as the elder Bloom is nothing short of spectacular. His work here was unfairly denied an Oscar nomination and possibly the gold trophy itself.  Why is it we take some of our finest actors for granted?  Ewan McGregor as Edward Bloom as a young man is every bit Finney's equal and he is another talent we take for granted.  The remainder of the cast (Jessica Lange, Crudup, Helena Bonham-Carter) are all good.  I would also like to cite Alison Lohman as Edward Bloom's wife as a young woman.  I saw her in \\"Matchstick Men\\" and she was nothing short of stupendous.  She is somebody to look out for in the future.  Burton's direction is surehanded, the script is excellent, the art direction and cinematography is breathtaking.  Another citation has to go to another one of Danny Elfman's masterful music scores.  This film is one that grows on you and is one where repeat viewings will enhance your appreciation of it.
B000002NZO|5.0|This album has 2 of my favorite songs from Genesis.  The frist being \\"White mountain\\", the music is beautiful, there is a lot of emotions in the lyrics and I am amused by the tongue gymnastic of the lyrics.  My second is \\"The knife\\", the hard side of Genesis. <br /> <br />I do not agree with other reviewers when they qualify this album as not an easy listening album.  Hate does already done pretentious prog phrases.  I never needed time to get used to this album, it's melodious and mostly mellow. <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|This is easily my favorite album of 2003 (fave for 2002: Audioslave, fave for 2004: Velvet Revolver).  Innovative mix of spooky metal with a hip hop flavor - thoroughly modern. Then add a female singer and female dynamics - just can't get much better.  Every track on here is a 10.  Can't wait for the next one.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is pure genius. She writes such great songs. I can't really tell you my favorite punk rock song she has composed, since all of them are 5 stars.  For other great punk rock bands check out Green Day, Sum 41, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Rancid, and Ataris.
B000005Z0E|4.0|I've listened to this album many many times. I guess the best way to describe it is like this: <br />It's old school, don't be too shocked not to hear pac saying thug life every 4 bars. But if you ask me that's a good thing because the rap itself is more political and focuses on struggling and opression rather than money and groupies. It's really all a matter of whether or not you like the actual lyrics or just the voice and the beat, if you like this album go to the record store and get the Lost Tapes as well.
B000002HFU|5.0|There was no one quite like Dirty, and no album quite like this. Why doesn't this bull**** happen to wack MC's? Dirty was a standout performer in a group that reshaped the face of hip-hop in the mid 90's. People who never listened to rap before dove headfirst into underground hip-hop when they first heard the wu. While most MC's were just trying to convince us that they were crazy, Ol' Dirty was the real deal. One listen of \\"Return\\" will convince anyone of that. So long, Dirty. And thanks.
B00002E224|5.0|This is the film that you will watch over and over.  I just ordered Before Sunset about the same two people.  I saw the Before Sunset movie in the theater recently.  Recommend both of them highly.
B000002C25|5.0|It's true that Noel himself dispises this album, but he really should not. With Oasis preparing to release a new record in May 2005, I thought I'd a review of my favorite Oasis record. Be Here Now is a totally different sound featuring layers upon layers of guitars and plenty of long-running loud sounds. It also has some of the sweetest melodies the band has ever put out, such has \\"It's getting better, man!\\" and \\"I hope I think I know.\\" The only part of this album that I don't love (as in, I only LIKE) is the two-part \\"All Around the World.\\" Making it go on for almost 12 minutes on two tracks is totally unnecessary. But that's really my only complaint...maybe the fact that the record is lacking a little in bass. Other tracks such as \\"My Big Mouth\\" and \\"D'yer know what I mean\\" are flat-out rockers that show us a new side of Oasis. Each track tends to play like \\"Champange Supernova\\" and its epic-feel. Jam-packed with Beatles referenes and masterpiece after masterpiece of epic songs, I encourage all doubtful Oasis fans to give this album another listen (through good headphones) and hopefully you'll realize it's beauty.
B0002Y4TZG|3.0|This isn't a review of the Clash's \\"London Calling\\" album, which for all purposes is one of, if not the, greatest albums of all tie. This is a critique of this package of the album. <br />The record itself is amazong, though it is the exact the same as the record that has been out on C.D. for the past five years. <br />But the extras are a bit of a sham. The widely bootlegged \\"Vanilla Tapes\\" were actually better in their bootleg quality. Here the sound is muddled, which wouldn't be a bad thing if you could actually hear it all, but since there has been absolutley no effort made to fix the sound, it just reeks of laziness, like someone at Epic Records decided to drain more cash from Clash fans since the only surefire way to sell records anymore is re-releasing classic albums to people who all ready own them. <br />The DVD is made up of things that are all ready availble on the far superior \\"Westway to the World\\", except this time again it feels like a patchwork. The editing is choppy, and it looks, feels, and probably is just a way to jack the price up another five to ten bucks. <br />The reason for the re-releasing, and most of this type of stuff(you hear me Weezer) is to make money. There is something wrong about this that I can't even explain it in words. This package feels like something Joe Strummer would have been against. <br />If you are a Clash fan then you no doubt disagree with me, and that's cool. All of this is subjective. And if you don't own \\"London Calling\\", then by all means get it as quickly as you can. But not this version. Get the single C.D. version.
B00005614N|5.0|This is truly a classic. This is a Roulette Records session from 1961 where these two legends teamed up on 17 Duke compositions. This includes ten informative pages of liner notes which includes this postscript...\\"because Roulette had used Duke without permission from Columbia, that label got it's quid-pro-quid by obtaining the entire Basie band from Roulette to record both band together. Morris Levy wasn't such a tough guy after all.\\" Gotta love Mo.
B00006SFBD|5.0|well. If u want the heaviest music Deliverance is a perfect album for you. Opeth still have there strong Death sound, but now explore through classical sounds. If you enjoyed hurry up and go see them live! that's even more fun. Anyway this album is so dark and filled with talent. If you hate humans buy this album! because i do!
B000002KNI|4.0|A half-million people showed up for this long awaited re-union!This album documented what must have been a magical evening. It's pretty cool to hear how the Paul Simon solo hits sound with Garfunkel singing along.
B00005614M|5.0|This is one of the most unique jazz albums ever produced and is an essential.  Miles's first essential album has him with a nonet (Two saxes (an alto and bari), one trombone, one french horn, one tuba, a rythymn section, and of course Miles himself).  There are three different nonets on this cd with that instrumentation, and he is joined by such greats as John Lewis, Gerry Mulligan, Max Roach, Lee Konitz, J.J. Johnson, and Kai Winding.  Each of the twelve tracks is unique in its own way, even though the same mood is sustained throughout the remainder of the album.  Even though all of the tracks are good, some highlights are: \\"Move\\", \\"Jeru\\", \\"Boplicity\\", and \\"Israel\\".  So if you're a fan of Miles's quintet/sextet stuff of the fifties and sixties, and want to hear him in a different setting than \\"Birth of the Cool\\" is for you!
B00006JLX4|3.0|After spending zillion hours listening for Pixies' records, I started the quest for holy sequel. I wanted a band, that could impress me with energy, vision, aggression and familiar songwriting. Many really cool bands followed the Pixies - Weezer, Nirvana, Radiohead, Manic Street Preachers, Blur. I love them all. But i wanted more. Reviews on \\"Slanted & Enchanted\\" disturbed me. Many critics and people said: this album is a real gem of 90s indie rock. I had just one Pavement's song in my collection - \\"Here\\", greatly performed by Tindersticks. And i bought this remastered edition.  I think, this is a good album. Yes. But not great - in every point. Some songs sounding like outtakes from \\"Daydream Nation\\". Some songs sounding like a raw blueprint for Weezer. Some songs sounding like a tired Pixies cover band. I don't understand WHY many indie-fans praise this Pavement debut. There are a lot of greater music, recorded in same years.  Overall it had some enjoyable points, and some bonus tracks are very interesting. I can recommend it to indie-rock / low-fi / garage rock / post punk listeners. But remember - even the White Stripes is better than this one!
B0001XAPX8|4.0|So much of movie watching has to do with the hype, and therefore, expectations, surrounding a film.  Since I had not heard much of this movie, I was surprised to find such an all star ensemble in an unheralded film.  So I had the pleasure of simply watching it with no expectations, no book to compare it with, etc.  The result was a compelling story of twisted lives coming to grips with themselves and their pasts.  Nicole Kidman has to be one of the greatest actors of our generation, since she plays her white trailer trash role to perfection, accent and all.  Anthony Hopkins use of subtle expression and understatement add tension and depth to the film.  If you like complex, interwoven stories with good characters, you will like this film.
B00005JN4O|4.0|This story is based on James Barrie, the playwright best known for Peter Pan and it is one of the best films that I've seen this year, despite receiving next to no hype or marketing push.    James Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a playwright, successful enough to have a nice house with servants, and a beautiful wife (Radha Mitchell). Still, his marriage seems distant and he is bothered by the mediocrity of his creative output. On opening night, people complement him on his terrible plays and he knows they are just trying to be nice.      One day while sitting on a park bench, he encounters three adolescent boys, who he quickly befriends. He invites them over for dinner and also solidifies a friendship with their mother, played by Kate Winslet, much to the disappointment of his wife and her mother, the stern, protective Julie Christie. The boy's father died from cancer and to some extent, his becomes their playmate, without trying to replace their dad. At the same time, his wife becomes increasingly disenchanted that her husband is spending so much time with another woman and her children.    As his friendship grows with the boys and her mother, he begins to develop a play, loosely based about them. While initially met with skepticism in the planning stages, the play ends up becoming Barrie's most famous creation.    While less visually fantastic than last year's Big Fish by Tim Burton, Finding Neverland has its own tastefully limited special effects, but it outshines Burton's film in its amount of sheer heart.    I actually ended up seeing this film since I arrived too late for the film I originally wanted to see. At the end of Finding Neverland, I was not even slightly surprised to see the audience burst into applause. It was also nice to see that the film was sold out.    The acting is well done without being spectacular. I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance, but he didn't play the role with an extraordinary amount of charisma. Some people will see this as a failing, but Ithink a genuine performance is better than glitzy but shallow one. One of the children is particularly strong, playing the role of Peter. He's the youngest but at the same time he's complex, cynical and surprisingly mature.
B00003CXCD|5.0|In a beautifully restored print, this fairy tale movie provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. The approach works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. One can see her star rising most precipitously throughout this film, even in scenes as seemingly minor as the one where she sits on the Spanish Steps breathlessly describing her perfect day. Nonetheless, the revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie, quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc from opportunistic reporter to smitten commoner that makes the ending so bittersweet.<br /><br />Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like \\"Wuthering Heights\\" or \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has some nice extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to movie costuming. A lovely reminder of what great stars Hepburn and Peck were during Hollywood's golden age.
B00000728J|5.0|Everything Is Wrong: Mixed & Remixed is surprisingly one of my favorite releases by Moby.  After searching through the long list of singles and rare albums by him on Amazon, I came across this and read a few reviews for it.  I was skeptical about it and skipped over it.  A month later I was in a local used CD store that had hoards and hoards of old used techno CDs-and this caught my eye.  Again, I was skeptical.  It couldn't possibly be as good as his huge releases like Play or 18, but when I brought it up to the counter to listen to it I was shocked to find that it was more of an exciting listen than parts of 18, Play, or any one of his other CDs.  Unlike anything I had heard by Moby, it had a real feel of continuity and flow to it that I hadn't felt from many other artists.  Every song works as a perfect remix to its counterpart original and most times improves on where the original fell short.  Within the first week I owned it I must have listened through the entire album (discs one and two) at least 20 or 30 times.  Each disc has a specific feel to it-disc one is described on the back cover as \\"Hard Techno,\\" \\"Joyous Anthems,\\" and \\"Quiet Ambience.\\"  Disc two is \\"New York Hard House,\\" \\"Groovy Acid,\\" and \\"Melodic Trance.\\"  This is a rare treat and is what I consider probably the best buy I have ever made-an amazing double CD (2 full hours in length) for about half of the normal price.  I urge you, if you have heard and enjoyed any of Moby's music such as \\"Everything is Wrong\\" then buy this immediately.
1573225517|4.0|I was required to read this book for a Modern Fiction class I am in. I really did enjoy the work and would recommend it to others.  <br /> <br />This book is about the \\"modern loser\\", Rob, who is a music snob. Rob uses his top five all time most humiliating heart breaks to describe who he is and where he comes from. He shows you his faults and lets you into his mind. This \\"modern loser\\" is easy to relate to or relate to someone you know.  <br /> <br />The book begins with his long time girlfriend walking out on him, a thing he is familiar with. You are spun through the heart breaks of Rob's life and how each one has brought him to the man you see today. Rob, who owns a record store, uses music as a biography of his life. He looks down on those who are not in-the-know about what good music is, or at least his version of it and blames pop music for the depressing life of its fans.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed seeing through Rob's eyes his view of women. You could see his record shop and the people who worked there. I enjoyed the way Rob described things from his life. I could have lived without so many of his top five lists. I am not a music snob so some of the music talk bored me.  <br />  <br />This book is really enjoyable but I do recommend reading the book before watching the movie.  <br />
B0006FO8RA|4.0|Britney's &quot;Greatest Hits: My Prerogative&quot; is exactly what it sounds like - it's all her greatest hits, although as the Amazon review stated, it's missing &quot;From the bottom of my broken heart&quot;. However, Amazon also forgot (along with everyone else) about the second song it's missing: &quot;I love rock and roll&quot;, from the album \\"Britney\\" and the  Crossroads soundtrack- possibly because it was her only song not to make it up on the UK charts.<br />I personally like this album because while I am not a really big Britney fan and I don't buy her CDs, &quot;Greatest Hits: My Prerogative&quot; has all her dance tunes lined up in neat procession, without the unneeded accompaniment of fillers and sappy love songs.<br />Her three &quot;previously unreleased&quot; songs are alright - &quot;My Perogative&quot; 's tell-it-like-it-is lyrics are quite empowering and speak true to Britney's current tabloid-frenzied life, however, the album could probably due without track #16, &quot;I've just begun (having my fun)&quot;. A thoroughly pointless song that isn't really catchy, I can't see why it went so high on the online download charts. Yet #17 is more promising; again, not one of her best songs and not single-worthy, it reminds me (slightly) of Gwen Stefani's new song &quot;What you Waiting For?&quot; - only without the sassiness of Ms. Stefani.<br />Overall, I think we finally have a Britney CD worthy buying, whether you're a casual fan or a die-hard Britaholic. My only gripe, other than tracks #16 and #17, is the album cover. Could Britney possibly look any more emaciated or gross? As a teenager myself, I speak from experience when I say it's pictures like that that make girls develop eating disorders.
B000001FS3|5.0|Even though I consider Achtung Baby their best, this just narrowly misses it but back in 1987, this was a definate welcome. In a decade of wannabe new wave groups and sound-alike pop metal, U2 gave an album with depth and substance. <br /> <br />Where the Streets Have No Name: The.Best.Intro.Ever. After church-like synth, we have Edge's classic delay-laden riff. Despite the repetitive structure, it holds it's own as one of their great epics. 10/10 <br /> <br />I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For: a very long title for a great anthem. A song about an endless search. While Streets was big and epic, this is fairly mid-tempo but without being ballad-like. 10/10 <br /> <br />With or Without You: A song more about the darker side of a relationship, the first single and a smash hit. Edge does probably the most beautiful guitar notes that seem to go on forever, and of course there's Bono's emotional climax at the end. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bullet the Blue Sky: Like Achtung Baby's opening trilogy, the next song just ruins it. Pretentious lyrics and clumsy rock despite Edge's cool guitar work. Still played live. Why? No clue. 6/10 <br /> <br />Running to Stand Still: taking away BtBS and you'd have a flawless quadrilogy opening. But even after BtBS, you have a slow song with probably Bono's most emotional vocal performance. Their best drug song since Bad. 9/10 <br /> <br />Red Hill Mining Town: Bono's vocal performance is top-form but the rest of the song? It's ok. His vocals more than saves the song, Edge does good guitar work to compliment but it's not compelling enough for me. 7/10 <br /> <br />In God's Country: Ahhh, here we go. Nice, upbeat, catchy, with an awesome Edge intro. Lots of overdubs by Edge. Sounds like a lot of unneccessary guitar parts but only Edge can make it all sound great. 8/10 <br /> <br />Trip Through Your Wires: I wasn't a big fan of the bluesy rock songs from Rattle and Hum and this is no exception. Oddly this was one of Edge's favorites although the band didn't like it. Band compromised and Bono added harmonica. Meh, not a huge fan of it. 7/10 <br /> <br />One Tree Hill: Now this is more like it. Written for one of the band's closest friends, it's a nice tribute without having those overdone ballad-esque feels. It's catchy and nice to listen to, although what's with that thing at the end? 9/10 <br /> <br />Exit: A slow but big builder once it gets going. Song about a man who got enraged and shot his wife. Song sure sounds like it. It sounds angry and it's a awesome song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Mothers of the Disappeared: Probably the most beautiful closers they've done to date. Written about an incident in Argentina where children were kidnapped and killed because locals were turning into compassionate people. Rather than having a pissed off song like Bullet, it's a cry for acceptance and peace without being preachy. Haunting and eerie. 10/10 <br /> <br />Some missteps here and there but their minor grievances. Great guitar work, passionate vocals, poetic lyrics and some classics prove that U2 was a band that was sorely needed.
B00063F8B2|3.0|Let me begin this review by stating what I feel should be obvious to any score collector: this is the best Christmas score since John Williams's classic \\"Home Alone\\" score. Alan Silvestri has pulled out all the stops in creating an exquisite accompaniment to an exquisite film.<br />No less than six themes can be found in this score. The principal theme, the \\"Believe\\" theme forms the heart of the score and is used as the foundation of the Josh Groban song of the same name. Another theme is the \\"Seeing is Believing\\" theme, featuring a solo celesta that represents not only the main character's desire to believe in Santa, but also his reluctance to do so for fear of being had.<br />As for the songs Silvestri composed (with lyrics by Glen Ballard), they serve their purpose in the film, although the lyrics occasionally feel forced and clich&eacute;d (\\"When Christmas Comes To Town\\" being the worst example). The Steven Tyler song \\"Rockin' On Top Of The World\\" is a very poor effort that was, thankfully, only included for a few seconds in the film. The highlight is \\"Spirit Of The Season\\", Silvestri's carol for the film that will surely go down in film lore as the equivalent of Williams's \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" from \\"Home Alone\\".<br />As for the album presentation of this score, Warner Bros. once again has marketed to the lowest common denominator. Instead of being an album of entirely original music for the film, six of the fourteen tracks are traditional Christmas songs that can be found on any compilation album. In the film, these songs were used only as \\"elevator music\\" in the North Pole scenes, and completely destroy the mood of magic and mystery that Silvestri created. When will label executives realize that serious fans of film composers want the film score on album, not pop songs? As it is, Silvestri's score occupies a mere two tracks on this album. So this means that, since most of the film had music, and the film was 90 minutes long, there were approximately 60 minutes of score recorded for the film. And we get a mere two tracks? Brilliant, Warner Bros., brilliant. Just like when you threw out Gabriel Yared's superb score for \\"Troy\\" and replaced it with a Horner score that was written in 13 days because a preview audience member felt Yared's work was too \\"old fashioned\\". (The film still tanked, by the way.)<br />In conclusion, buy this album for Silvestri's work, because it's phenomenal, and hope that someday a label like Var&egrave;se Sarabande will get the rights and do a proper score release. In the meantime, listen to this album and be appalled by how many of the non-original songs you already have in your collection and how you were cheated by moronic record executives eager to get a quick buck from the uninformed consumer.<br /><br />Silvestri's music as heard in film: ***** of 5<br />Silvestri's music as heard on album: ***** of 5<br />Non-original music as heard on album: * of 5<br />Album overall: *** of 5or the film.

0385508417|3.0|One should know better than to read a book after seeing the cover re-done with the Tim Allen movie cover.<br /><br />My mother gave this to me last year as a \\"must read\\". I thought so highly of her suggestion, it wasn't read until now, a year later only after I had no new books on my shelves to read and hadn't had time to buy something new to start.<br /><br />I loved the idea at first, the Krank's skipping Christmas and all the material fuss. The financial aspect had me questioning my own holiday plans. But after being sucked in to the wonderful idea and these two happy people planning what seems to be their second honeymoon, I was dropped flat by the need to reach in to the book and punch all the other characters.<br /><br />Who cares if these poor people do not celebrate? Apparently, everyone in their town. It becomes a nosey neighbor free-for-all on who can one up the next.<br /><br />After Grisham has made you feel sorry for poor Luther, he poorly attempts to add a last minute stranger who adds simply nothing to the plot. I am not even sure what he was there for.<br /><br />All in all, I might have just waited for the Tim Allen movie. At least then, I could have fast forwarded to the end and saved myself the trouble.
B00012FXB8|1.0|This is easily the worst Alien film, which is remarkable considering how awful the fourth film was.     Alien 3 is often muddled, dark and incomprehensible with an annoying music video/video game quality to the filmmaking that makes it difficult to sit through.     While the first two Alien films are classics and worth being in any film buffs collection, the last two are truly awful and should be ignored as cheap, unworthy successors.     At least the fourth film had some of an amatuerish \\"so bad, it's funny\\" quality to it. This film is just an awful, depressing mess. Avoid it like the plague.
B000001DTM|5.0|1987 was a relatively low point in music. Wave after wave of new wave and \\"metal\\" singing about girls, drinking with girls, or doing girls. In comes U2 on their 5th album, The Joshua Tree that showed layered production and one thing the metal scene was lacking: depth. Year later they put out Rattle and Hum, a cd and movie duo that many thought was self-indulgent and pompous despite having some of U2's best songs. Flash forward to 1990 when the band was having some frustrating studio sessions. A jam on the song One becomes the saving grace and as a result, they have a record that, personally, eclipses Joshua Tree.    Zoo Station: Helter Skelter from R&H was an ok closer. This is an awesome opener. A heavily distorted riff introduces the new sound. One complaint: the chorus when Bono sings the title: first time it's whispered, second it's dead on catchy, third it's in the background. 9/10    Even Better Than the Real Thing: an upbeat rocker that gets better as it goes on and gets better more you listen. Had a very memorable video. 9/10    One: No question: THE best song Bono has written, and the band has performed. Lyrically simple, musically simple, yet dig into it's meaning, you'll find a huge bank of meanings that makes the song personal for it's listener due it's versatility. 12/10    Until the End of the World: after the 3 punch assault of the last songs, here comes a song that while not horrible, it kinda ruins the flow. A great arena filling riff and a conversation between Jesus and Judas mixed in with a great Edge solo. An unofficial single(a video was made but don't think it was commercially released) 7.5/10    Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses: I like this version better over the single version. The guitars to me sound fuller. Lyrics to me seem to talk about an affair. Another single. 9/10    So Cruel: Things slow down but don't mean it's boring. A simple catchy piano melody. The song may not have a big climax but I still find it listenable and a bit catchyat times. 8/10    The Fly: The first single to introduce the new sound and it's a doozy: big distorted Edge riff with industrial beats and a duel chorus between Bono's normal voice and his \\"gospel voice\\". I like the gospel chorus better although he barely sings it at times live. 8/10    Mysterious Ways: Probably the most danciest song U2 has done since...well ever. It's catchy but it seems overplayed to me. Sometimes I skip, sometimes I sing along but it's still good. 8/10    Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World: well written, although quite slow. Chorus is very catchy. And it also has the well known fish needs a bicycle line. 8/10    Ultraviolet(Light My Way): After a slow building opening, you get an insanely catchy guitar riff with the catchiest hook on the album(\\"baby baby light my way\\"), runs a little bit long but very minor gripe. 9/10    Acrobat: Here's where the record starts to drop off. If Hold Me, Thrill Me and Miss Sarajevo were written during these sessions and replaced this and the next song, you'd have the most flawless record of the 90's. Instead we get this ok song that's underrated by some, but not compelling. 7/10    Love is Blindless: keeping with the tradition of a soft subdued closer, U2 gives us this. I find myself sometimes listening to it now and then but for me, the record ends with Ultraviolet. 7.5/10    The Joshua Tree had a couple songs that could've been dropped or changed around a bit but it was one of those sum-is-greater-than-parts records where the great tracks outweigh the bad but the bad still pokes his head. Even with the last 2, Achtung Baby is a personal favorite and one of my top 3 records ever.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Like the song that was written for her, \\"A Love That Will Last\\", Renee Olstead is here to stay.  Unless you know that Renee is a fifteen year old, you have no idea that this marvelous voice belongs to a teenager.  She sounds so much older in the arrangements, and her voice is so melodic and stylistic. As some would say, Renee has an arranger and conductor and entrepreneur, David Foster, who ensures that this songstress will be her best.<br /><br />The songs Renee chose to sing are the standards, the songs that we remember being sung by Ella and Diana. My favorite is the song that was written for her by Linda Thompson, \\"A Love That Will Last\\". A new song sung by a new voice, but sounding so sultry and defined.  \\"What A Difference a Day Makes\\", is one of the standards that stands out- a lyrical salute to the oldies. \\"Summertime\\" is graceful and lazy and easy. \\"Is It You Or Is You Ain't My Baby\\", is one of those songs that has your toes tappin' and your fingers snappin' to the beat. The other songs are the old standards that we all love: \\"Taking A Chance On Love\\", \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\", the old Neil Sedaka song, and \\"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do,\\" Sunday Kind Of Love\\", \\"On A Slow Boat To China\\", \\"Midnight At The Oasis\\", and \\"Sentimental Journey\\".<br /><br />This CD is a find; it was a present to me to mark the end of treatment and will always have a place in my heart. This young, fresh voice brings hope and renewal to us all.<br /><br />Renee Olstead has a future that is bright, and at this young age, she will need guidance and support. She has found this in David Foster. He has assisted in the career of Josh Groban and other young people.  This is a CD to be recommended. prisrob
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Relationship Of Command is ATD-I's finest work, closely matched with the Vaya EP. Here's how the tracks stand out.<br />1. Arc Arsenal - Fast, explosive opener to the album that really shows what ATD-I is all about. 9/10<br />2. Pattern Against User - Amazing song with great beat, great lyrics, and great sounds. An amazing experience. 10/10<br />3. One Armed Scissor - A very solid song, but it can lose some interest after several plays. 8/10<br />4. Sleepwalk Capsules - Fast, fun song, but vocals can get annoying. 8/10<br />5. Invalid Litter Dept. - This is the song that changed everything. The haunting rants of Cedric, mixed with the powerful chorus, makes this song very meaningful. 9.5/10<br />6. Mannequin Republic - While many people do not enjoy this track, I seem to just start rocking out when listening to this song. The screams, the fast pace, and the guitar line, makes you just want to scream along. 10/10<br />7. Enfilade - Good song, with an explosive chorrus - 9.5/10<br />8. Rolodex Propoganda - The worst song on the album, while it is still good. 7.5/10<br />9. Quarantined - Seriously, this song is one of the best rock songs ever. 100/10<br />10. Cosmonaut - An extremely exciting, fast song. Cedric's best singing moment is in the bridge of the sond (the screaming part).10/10<br />11. Non-Zero Possibility - Another beautiful, yet haunting song.This makes me smile everytime at the end, but I have no idea why. 10/10
B000001EGE|5.0|I am in love with this album. Every track is wonderfully written and composed and Elton's two best songs of all (in my opinion, of course) are here: 'Rocketman' and 'Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters'. The rest of the album is just stellar, with the upbeat and irresistable 'Honky Cat', the thinking person's song, 'Mellow' and the satirical 'I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself'. The music and lyrics by Elton John and Bernie Taupin (respectively) are an unbeatable combination and they are still doing it. See their latest effort, 'Peachtree Road'. This truly is a classic Elton album.
B0000TB050|5.0|This a unique glimpse of the band at home, and they are fantastic. This is the first concert DVD that I've played start to finish and never had to desire to skip ahead on a song or two, that's because U2 keeps the energy level extreemly high. On top of a great concert and great musical performance, the show is very entertaining and Bono's dialog with the audience makes the concert even more special. <br /> <br />If you do buy this, read the booklet that comes with it. It helps explain some of the events going on that may otherwise be overlooked. <br /> <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|listen before you critize this review. This is a great movie, mainly, because of its breathtaking and mersmerizing animation. it is a techinque that hasn't been done before.Robert Zemckis took a real risk and it payed off because this film is excellent. The only problem I had with this movie was that Tom Hanks did too many voices. They could've branched out and could've had some other actors to do the other voices. \<br /><br />The film is about a boy whose name is not said, is in bed on christmas eve and he rubs off off of us as a non-beliver of Santa. He, all the sudden, feels a rumbling and see lights, and he gets his robe on and goes out to look, it is The Polar Express, with Tom Hanks as The Conductor waiting to take him and a large amount of kids to the North Pole. He goes on the journey to the north pole and along the way He meets a ghost hobo, a boy afraid of christmas, a boy that is a smarty pants, and a girl that becomes his friend for the film and helps him make it through the movie. The movie is literally a roller coster ride, there are so many twist and turns on the way that you feel that you are riding along with them. This movie stays so true to the book, you won't belive it. Most movies base itself on the books! The ending made me tearful to know that Hero Boy now belived in Santa. That got me.<br /><br />Robert has a great movie on his hands. Yet another great collaberation with Tom Hanks, that is full of Christmas cheer, imagination, and fun. Go see this movie a lot, and see it near Christmas time if it is still in movie theathers. I loved it, my mom loved it, and the rest of the family loved it.<br /><br />Go see it right now!
B0001EBXBK|3.0|The first 20 min was just great!!!! Good action, but after that the movie was so rare, and with chapters, and  couldnt understant nothing after that.<br />The acting is good ! but the movie is weard :$.
B00005JMUL|3.0|I don't normally write many reviews online but I had to come on and write a quick review about this movie.  Today, I took my 7 year old son to see the Polar Express.  We were both looking forward to it very much and I personally thought it was a well written movie, but....my son went in fully believing and came out with a lot of doubt and a lot of questions to my dismay.  I know that the movie is supposed to make kids with question suddenly believe, but, it did the oposite for us.  It opened his eyes to a lot of things that he hadn't really thought about until he saw it being questioned in the movie.  My advice to parents is that if you bring your kids to the movie, be prepared for the possibility of the doubt coming out of the film.
B00003CXI1|1.0|This movie is a pastiche of cliches right out of almost every British childhood story from \\"Tom Brown's School Days\\" on. The special effects for the most part look as though they were done in the 1960s or 70s, and I've seen better make-up in old Dr. Who reruns. The muzak is worthy of the most derivative drivel by John Williams, swelling to clue the audience to the heroic bits and cloying to signal the sweeter nougat. The only sadder sign of massive cultural collapse than the popularity of this sort of cobbled together candyfloss is the number of people who think that the Harry Potter books are \\"manuals for the Religion of Witchcraft.\\" <br /> <br />No wonder Spam is making a comeback in Ms. Rowland's homeland. If you want some good childhood fantasy stuff, try some of Roald Dahl's old classics; he at least had some imagination, and there have been better movie adaptions from some of his books.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I went to see Troy in the theater and wasn't expecting too much.  I will have to say I was impressed with this film.  I thought the story and acting were very good. Even though Brad Pitt is considered the \\"star\\" of this, the other actors roles were great.   <br />If you enjoy a good mix of action, romance, and drama, then you should like Troy.  I was wondering when they would release this and will definitely pick up a copy when it comes out.
B00063MBU8|5.0|With the intruduction of Simple Plan back in 2002 with their pop-punkish debut album No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls, teenaged boys and girls were able to express angst against the world and their parents with some pretty catchy hooks.  Now, with the release of their sophmore album it truly shows how those 5 French-Canadian guys from Montreal have matured throughout the years.  With songs about death, war, hate, love, broken friendship.. and of course being a kid, Still Not Getting Any is one of the best CD's to come out in 2004 and will truly make an impact on their professional career and their listeners.
B000002A46|5.0|This is a must have Christmas album! It's been ten years since this cd came out and I never get tired of it. Mariah's voice is amazing and the choice of songs mixed with the ones she wrote make it a instant classic. This is just a beautiful cd! <br />TRACKLISTING: <br />1. Silent Night - very classic <br />2. All I Want For Christmas - upbeat song that Mariah wrote, about wanting the one you love to be there for Christmas <br />3. O Holy Night -  my favorite! I love this song in general but her vocals just amaze me... <br />4. Christmas (baby please come home) - great, energized song... <br />5.

0679731725|5.0|Mr. Stevens is the last great butler at Darlington Hall, and has been serving their for so many years. With all the experiences he had, people he met, and personnel changes he went through, he was able to maintain his pride, professionalism, and self respect in the most untouchable ways. Then he is encouraged by his american master to go on vacation through the english country side,and to meet with Miss Kenton who has been an old friend and helper at the Hall.<br /><br />Kazuo Ishiguro describes Mr. Stevens and what is related to him in the most detailed but interesting ways. Ishiguro's \\"Remains of the day\\" is beautifully written, simply detailed, and reflects a lot of world history facts. It reprsents a clear statement to how much we get invloved in our duties and commitments that we lose our daily contact and awareness with the other side of our personal life that continues to exist.<br /><br />Mr. Stevens demonstrates the seriousness that we take life with and when we have a chance to make a break and change our own set rules we struggle making those calls on time, and we find it late to turn back the clock.
B00063MBU8|1.0|I wasn't expecting a GREAT album when I first heard, \\"Welvome to my Life,\\" but I didn't think it would sound like it does. It's very cliche, and VERY typical. Not to mention it sounds like everything else. If that's your taste, than by it. If you were expecting brilliant, then don't buy it.
0140277447|5.0|Previous reviewer mentioned: <br />>The book \\"The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II\\" could have been entitled \\"The Forgotten Holocausts and Wholecausts.\\" The book recounts the horrors of 300,000 deaths the Nanjing massacre in 1937 committed by Japanese soldiers. During WWII China lost 19 million.  <br /> <br />>It is sad to note that socialists and communists in the People's Republic of China went on to exceed that number, killing 35 million, in another forgotten Holocaust.  <br /> <br />>China's own Holocaust was exceeded by socialists in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, killing 62 million, in another forgotten Holocaust.  <br /> <br />Thank you for pointing out other holocausts that might happen in human history. However, I do not think your comments are related to this book at all. As you emphasized the holocausts by socialists and communists, I want to remind you that holocaust is not the \\"privilege\\" of socialists or communists. For example, the eradication of the American Indians (1775-1890) is not what socialists or communists did. Here is a list of numbers that you may want to take a look at: <br />Russel Thornton, American Indian Holocaust and Survival (1987)  <br />   1) Overall decline: From 600,000 (in 1800) to 250,000 (in 1890s) <br />   2) Indian Wars, from a 1894 report by US Census, cited by Thornton. Includes men, woman and children killed, 1775-1890:  <br />Whites: 19,000, Indians: 38,500 to 53,500, TOTAL: 65,000 +/- 7,500 <br /> <br />In your comments, you said \\"For example, here is an excerpt of a review that is referring to the Japanese, and applies equally well to the socialists and communists in China during the subsequent slaughter: 'Nanking, she writes, served as a kind of laboratory in which Japanese soldiers were taught to slaughter unarmed, unresisting civilians, as they would later do throughout Asia. Likening their victims to insects and animals, the Japanese commanders orchestrated a campaign in which several hundred thousand--no one is sure just how many--Chinese soldiers and noncombatants alike were killed.' \\" In analogy, it probably applies equally well to those whites who killed so many American indians. <br /> <br />Everyone makes mistakes. It is human nature. I did not give above examples to blame or annoy anyone. I just do not understand what your intention is to emphsize \\"socialists\\" or \\"communists\\" in your comments. If you want to talk about holocuast in human history, it is completely out of the scope of this book and should not be posted here. You can definitely elaborate this topic into tens or hundreds of books. Not to mention there are numerous holocausts committed by non-socialists and non-communists. If you just want to advertise your website, then I believe it violates Amazon.com's review policy.
0140277447|5.0|The following comments are quoted from \\"Convergence or Divergence? Recent Historical Writings on the Rape of Nanjing\\", a review by DAQING YANG, which is published in The American Historical Review Vol. 104, Issue 3.    Comments on Iris's work: Iris Chang's The Rape of Nanking is also one of the most comprehensive accounts that explores not only the atrocity but also its postwar remembrance. Chang accomplishes this remarkable feat by incorporating much of the recent work on the subject by Chinese and Chinese-American historians, including many disturbingly graphic photographs and a number of the translated documents. But Chang also has made her own discoveries. The diary of German businessman John Rabe, who headed the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, is perhaps the most well-publicized. Chang tries to describe the Japanese atrocities in Nanjing from three angles-Chinese victims, Japanese perpetrators, and Western eyewitnesses-in what she calls the \\"Rashmon perspective.\\"     Comments on some Japanese authors: One tendency is to reject an entire source-usually, incriminating ones-on account of the smallest irregularities. For instance, Itakura Yoshiaki, the businessman[...]\\"expert of the Nanjing Incident,\\" published a short study in 1997 ostensibly to ddress the issue of responsibility. After scrutinizing the battle records of two Japanese army units widely believed to have followed orders to execute Chinese captives, Itakura claimed to have found discrepancies in the sources and concluded that, \\"based on available evidence, orders to execute prisoners cannot be ascertained.\\" And some writers like Ara Ken'ichi, for instance, are prone to the \\"fallacy of negative proof,\\" arguing that whatever is denied by Japanese officers and journalists who had been in Nanjing or is not found in written sources becomes synonymous with non-existing events. A most alarming example is Higashinakano Osamichi, a professor of intellectual history who published a book in1998 that dismisses the Nanjing Massacre as a postwar concoction. After demonstrating that the \\"Nanjing Massacre\\" could not be found in many English-language and Chinese publications issued around the first anniversary of the event, he argues that \\"[the atrocities] were not recorded because they did not happen.\\" Higashinakano's effort to explain away the incriminating evidence is equally blatant. For just one example, he devotes a chapter to proving that \\"not taking prisoners,\\" as used in Lieutenant General Nakajima Kesago's wartime diary, meant setting all captured Chinese soldiers free, and thus there was no massacre. Yet Higashinakano deliberately ignores the fact that, a few lines later, Nakajima himself wrote about \\"finding a pit large enough to dispose of these 7,000-8,000 persons.\\"
B0006284JQ|5.0|This is the best collection of graetest hits ever put together.  Although this album is lacking a couple hits like Born to Make You, Happy From the bootom of My Broken Heart, and I Love Rock 'n' Roll, it is still awsome.  There is only one track that I do not agree with as a greatest hit, and that is I'm Not A Girl,...  It is just a really annoying song.  It seems like everyone hates her, but this Graetest Hits proves that deep down inside you all love her.  She would not have this album unless people loved her. If you think Britney has no talent, and think she is a [...].  You obviously are blind-sighted.  She is an amazing performer.  Her concerts prove that.  She may have been a little bit to scandly dressed, but look at how awsome she is.  She went through a lot, and I think Britney now knows she needs to cool down for a bit cause she kind of went crazy working so hard.  I have so much respect and admiration of this woman.  She is probably the biggest idol of all time.  She is even bigger than Madonna ever was.  I wish you the best Britney.  So if you are just sitting at the computer right now, \\"get up out of your seat, and do somethin'\\" buy this CD.  01. My Prerogative                          5/5  02.

B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I am, or WAS, a huge Eminem fan. I listened to all of his CD's and his singles. The Slim Shady LP had great songs, the Marshall Mathers LP didn't have a bad song and The Eminem Show started going down. First in the Eminem Show he ripped off Aerosmith. Em fans will say he ripped off Dido in \\"Stan\\", but that was actually good. The only thing good about \\"Sing For The Moment\\" was the Aerosmith portion of \\"Dream On\\". But that is a different record. <br /> <br />D-12 sucks. Eminem sucks. D-12 is nothing special to me. This CD is horrible. They are a bunch of losers mixed in with Eminem, and when you make that combination you get one bad band. But, Eminem will continue to get fake fans, followers and the media to support him, so he can make a CD worse then Michael Jackson's face and he will STILL get followers to say his album's are good. <br /> <br />As for the two hits, My Band and How Come, are both horrible. The first time I listened to \\"My Band\\" I just shut it off. After hearing it on the radio, I was extremely disappointed and was not laughing. The music video is sh*t, and it is not funny. When Eminem used to make fun of N'Sync and Britney Spears, but now he is just trying too hard. He thinks he can sell by being funny, but you get one good laugh and then you want to puke. The hooks are horrible and D-12 makes it worse. <br /> <br />How Come was alright. After a few radio plays, it became horrible. It wasn't like \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" where we can listen it to a million times and still not shut the radio off, but it is more like listening to \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"Yeah\\" a million times, then shutting it off. D-12 has no talent. They are a wannabe Eminem, and I don't know who wants to be like him except for some suburban white kid who thinks he knows hard life in the ghetto. It is time for Eminem to give up his band and to hang it up, for good...
B0002XVQNU|4.0|I always thought this movie was underrated and on the receiving end of too much flack. There was absolutely nothing wrong with Ben Affleck's performance and the rest of the cast did an amazing job. <br /> <br />Daredevil had an edge to it more so than Spiderman which was mainly focused at a child/teenage audience. This movie offers darker themes and covers greater areas. It explores the fine line between justice and vengeance, brutality, revenge, corruption, love and religion. <br /> <br />This movie did have a lot ground to cover in 90 mins such as Daredevil's origin and setting up the rest of the characters involved: Bullseye, Elektra and the KingPin. So you did grasp this understanding through the course of the film. <br /> <br />I thought the costumes were faithful to the comics although I didn't think much of Daredevil's mask which lacked a neck. It looked more like a \\"cap\\" and earlier on in the film (Subway Scene) more like a bandana. It does get a little anoying watching this especially since Spiderman's costume was so dead on with his comic book roots. They mentioned they didn't want Daredevil's costume to resemble Spiderman's but come on how can they possibly mistake Daredevil's image for Spidey??? <br /> <br />The final scene with Daredevil and Kingpin was a little rushed but they were trying to set up the sequel by ending the movie in this way. I honestly hope we do manage to get a sequel as there are just too many unanswered questions left over from this film that need to be resolved. <br /> <br />Overall a striking movie with a lot of vision and I am certain this Directors Cut will be an even deeper experience since he was forced to edit and omit scenes to obtain a PG 13 rating. Definitely one of the best comic book adaptations.
B0002DB52M|1.0|Sorry, I need locations when watching a movie.  I understand the director or writer was trying to be avante garde but this is ridiculous.  Try to be edgy without losing the audience next time.  Definitely for the brainiacs not for the realists.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I love how people attack michael moore's appearance instead of commenting on the movie.  This movie is groundbreaking, and ppl have got to stop being in denial.  Watch the movie with an open mind.  I saw a review saying that they looked up the facts afterward.  That's really smart.  And for people who watched the fahrenHYPE 9/11 movie, don't you think that will be just as biased as how you say michael moore is? think about that...
B00009ATIX|4.0|This review refers to the DVD release of Solaris, the remake. Just a couple of notes from the outset:<br /><br />(1) This film will not be well-liked by most people. There are a ton of spoilers in most reviews, so I'll try to boil it down for its essence to avoid ruining the unfolding of the movie should you choose to see it: a guy goes to a spaceship where weird things are happening and sees his dead wife. Maybe. That's all you need to know about the plot. The movie, some might think is slow, there's no action, it's a head-tripper, and honestly, had I not read the book before and also seen the magnificent Tarkovsky original, I might not have followed what was going on. As such, while I really enjoyed it, I can't call it either a great film nor one that is likely to appeal to a broad cross-section of movie watchers. There are some heady issues surrounding reality, consciousness, life and death, and if you take them too seriously you'll find yourself snoozing.<br /><br />It's definitely in Soderbergh's style, and it's been fun watching him skip between genres in recent years, but it's more like \\"The Limey\\" and less like \\"Erin Brockovich\\" if you want to pin it down. While it's not an indy flick -- in the sense it's expensive and bankrolled and produced in Hollywood fashion -- it feels like a small art film or an indy. And please, god, don't expect \\"Aliens\\" or \\"Titanic\\" because James Cameron's name is over the credits as Producer.<br /><br />(2) Both the original book and the Tarkovsky film have much to recommend them, although they also share characteristics of being verbally philosophical and talky which this version most assuredly does not. This version is incredibly tight.<br /><br />(3) If you're a film student or into the mechanics of film, though, this DVD edition is an utter delight. I can easily see this sequence in a film class curriculum: watch the movie; watch the DVD commentary; read the screenplay; watch the Tarkovsky \\"original\\"; read the Lem original source book; write your term paper.<br /><br />The DVD contains two interesting but not unusual featurettes on the making of the film. It also includes, somewhat unusually, a complete original screenplay (that you have to page through with the fast forward button). And it contains the customary Director's commentary, featuring director Stephen Soderbergh and producer James Cameron bantering about the movie. (In the honest assessment of Sodbergh, the commentary is \\"Just another version of two white guys sitting around talking.\\")<br /><br />The two of them discuss nearly every choice that was made in assembling the movie, from lighting and the use of post-production to CGI and whether to rehearse actors or not and dozens of technical tricks. And the movie itself is sort of like a catalog of techniques and effects. I don't mean to imply it's showing off: it simply uses a huge variety of film techniques to move the story along, and Cameron and Soderbergh discuss in the commentary both what works and what didn't work, what reshoots were required, what processes underlay the film, how the rewrites were done, and so forth --  and do it in a rather entertaining way, to this film fan, at least.<br /><br />And one of the things I enjoyed both about the film and the DVD is the way Soderbergh just endlessly pillages other directors and films: Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarkovsky himself, Eisenstein, heck, even the Lumiere brothers -- even a dash of James Cameron. As Cameron himself says at the end of the commentary, \\"There are no new ideas. We're a hundred years into the process of filmmaking now.\\"<br /><br />As such, while I enjoyed watching the movie, I rather much more enjoyed immediately re-viewing it with the commentary, and I think this is going to be a keeper for those who like studying technical details. It's like \\"Citizen Kane\\" in that it comes close to summarizing what the 21st century film-maker has at his or her fingertips (the way \\"Kane\\" slopped together virtually every technique of 1941 -- rest assured I'm not actually comparing the film's stature to Kane.) There's a bit of what Soderberg immodestly calls \\"pure cinema\\", visual-only story-telling, which does remind me of \\"The Limey\\" and some of the silent classics as well as \\"2001\\" and the original \\"Solaris\\", and I mean that all in a complimentary sense.<br /><br />It's also a huge genre-bender. There are elements of slasher flicks, ghost stories, horror, detective mystery, romantic tragedies, a very slight dash of comedy (thanks largely to the great Jeremey Davies in a supporting role), Soviet agitprop, Godard nouvelle vague, 1930s theatre, and who knows what else I missed the first couple of times I saw it.<br /><br />This is not a flick you're going to want to pick out for Saturday night brain candy, or to change your mood if you're depressed, because it will either bore you or depress you more if you want mood-altering fluff. But it's a good one-timer for those who like the brain-bending what-is-reality film along the lines of Philip K. Dick or Alejandro Almenabar, and a multi-viewer for film school.nique of 1941 -- rest assured I'm not actually comparing the film's stature to Kane.)

0060730552|4.0|This book was incredible! A great story that had me from page 1. I bought it for my wife (with a friend's recommendation) and we wound up fighting over it! We broke down and read it together. It was relatable to problems and hardships in life to anyone and so inspiring. We both plan to reread it. It'll stay in our collection.
B0002SROT0|4.0|this is an incredible album that draws more than a few comparisons to elliott' beloved beatles' White Album. it has a perfect balance of folkish, quiet songs like from his first three albums (&quot;Last Hour&quot;, &quot;let's get lost&quot;) as well as a number of stunning orchestral pieces with gorgeous layered vocals, very similar to figure 8 or xo. &quot;little one&quot;, &quot;king's crosing&quot;, &quot;coast to coast&quot; are all essential elliott tunes. the only bad things that i could say about the album are a) one can't help but read into EVERY LITTLE MENTION of death or suicide as prophetic (which may be fair or not, who knows), and b)this is the only elliott smith album that i had to listen to more than once to love it(which i guess could be seen as positive, too). One thing that makes me kind of sad is that i'm afraid that some people will buy from a basement because of the tragic circumstances surrounding it, this i would not recommend. Instead, go pick up a copy of either/or, and figure 8. Try and understand the music he made before he died before you try and understand what he's saying with from a basement on the hill.
1401301010|4.0|I've always found Anthony Kiedis to be unusually articulate -- especially for a rock star.  Consequently, I was looking forward to reading his autobiography.  The book is riveting for a number of reasons.  First, Kiedis is pretty unflinching in describing the sordid events in his life revolving around his addictions to heroin and coke. At certain points, you get frustrated that this guy, who seems so smart and introspective, keeps falling into the same self-destructive patterns.  His account has given me a new perspective on drug addiction.  Second, I am a long-time Chili Peppers fan (Uplift MoFo Party Plan is probably my favorite album) and learned more details about the history of the band and the guys who have played in it over the years.  Third, this guy's sexual history is truly impressive.  From \\"sleeping\\" with Cher as a kid to his steady stream of actress/model girlfriends as an adult, he recalls his romances in a way that is neither exploitive nor sugar-coated.  Fourth, I'm about a year younger than Kiedis and his descriptions of life in the '70's and '80's were often so vivid that I felt nostalgic for those times more than once.  This is a well written book and I highly recommend it.  Kiedis' story will be of particular interest to fans of the RHCP but I think many non-fans will also enjoy reading it.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Simply put, this album is monstrous.  The Edge dominates most of album with brilliant guitar work.  Bono's soaring vocals manage to bring a tear to the eye of even the hardest soul.  Don't forget about the best rhythm section in the business - Adam & Larry.   <br /> <br />U2 continues to be the most relevant band in rock.  The new album is U2's masterstroke.  I suggest that other rock bands listen to this CD and take notes.
B00068IOWM|2.0|Why so many fans think with albums like ATYCLB and this one HTDAAB 80's U2 is back ?. I think that sentence is pointless, there's no way for U2 to return to these days. U2 in the 80's had many things to say, both with music and lyrics, but now...\\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" at the end of Vertigo is something horrible !! by the way, Bono is far from 80's voice. This album is inoffensive, inopportune, accessible, pop, false, and overall the worst possible way to celebrate their 25th birthday. I think a far better way could have been a remastered releasing of all their classic albums, from Boy until Pop, as well Live DVD's with previously unreleased footage ( Like Led Zeppelin DVD ). Is a shame, really. The fans can swallow any U2 stuff, just because is something new, but that doesn't mean quality at all. There's no one memorable and unforgettable song here, like Pride ( in the name of love ), Sunday Bloody Sunday, One or Stay. Now is time for re-discovering underrated albums like Zooropa or Pop, and bury this \\"new\\" U2. How so many fans can be blind, and say this is equal to Joshua Tree, Acthung Baby or Unforgettable Fire ? there's no new music here, no new guitars, no new style, is just another ATYCLB with a few spices courtessy of The Edge, but even him sounds like always here. <br />The title was chosen obviously just for typical reviews like \\"this album is a bomb\\" and things like that. The more I listen the album, the more I lament to see what have they done  <br />these last years, wasting all the time staining, soiling, burying and their extraordinary career seeking for instantaneous grammy and money. It's been a long time in which U2 doesn't offer anything really new, neither with new LP's nor with the live concerts, but having the great advantage of being a recognized and respected band throughout the world, U2 always <br />will have fans that acclaim anything that they  <br />put on the radios, like this \\"bomb\\". <br />I really feel embarresed when I listen to this new U2 album, and I have to admit I ashamed of U2 now. I have listen this band since Joshua Tree, but now they have become in music for sissies <br />The title of this album must have been \\"How to dismantle a band who used to make music and surprise the world\\"
B0006284JQ|4.0|When I heard about this cd, I immediately did not want to purchase it. The track arrangements and lack of several singles of hers I liked simply made me want to avoid it all costs. Besides, with Shania's hits album that week it simply made me not want it. <br /> <br />Well, it turned out the album came with a bonus remix cd featuring remixes of songs from the In The Zone album (which I liked) and was only priced at $9.98. Well let me tell you! <br /> <br />The CD's tracklisting is horrific. It puts this emphasis on her negative singles (disc kicks off with the spitefully sung \\"Prerogative) and clumps them in with \\"the best of\\" her overproduced electronic jargon. The disc seems to purposely avoid including wholesome singles like \\"Born To Make You Happy,\\" \\"From The Bottom..,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" or even any of her hit Pepsi songs or her smash-hit Christmas song to add to brighten Holiday spirits. The album comes close, keeping \\"Sometimes\\" - but with it being all the way at track 11 after hearing Britney's non-stop negativity, you can bet you won't feel very enlightened! <br /> <br />\\"Not A Girl\\" is included, but in a strange way with heavy synthesizers and dubs all over her voice - I don't remember the song ever sounding like that. Nonetheless, with it being the album's only ballad (alongside the suicidal \\"Everytime\\"), and not popping up until track 15, it's too little, too late. And those 2 tracks tagged on at the end suck. Ditto for the 2 remixes off that horrific \\"Britney\\" album. The singles sound better on their actual albums when they're shown in light, as opposed to the psychotic pessimism they seem to be echoing here. <br /> <br />Overall, the first track (and first single) is a nice Britney song, the way the album layouts and everything is done is very nice a majestic, and the holographic view of all her vibrant cd covers is simply stunning. However, the album's only real redeeming factor comes (unfortunately) on the remix cd - which actually comes free with the album - where it showcases several of her tracks in a positive, storytelling light in new versions. <br /> <br />All in all, my rating comes for the actual songs (docking off a star for the 4 I don't like) and not for the way the album is set up.
B0002S943O|4.0|I saw Depeche Mode a couple of times on the \\"Faith and Devotion\\" tour, and also bought the \\"Devotional\\" VHS when it came out all those years ago.<br /><br />DVD1 of \\"Devotional\\" is a transfer of the original VHS movie, and the great improvement is of course the sound, which is exceptional. The performance of the band is outstanding, and the song selection rightly focuses on the \\"Faith and Devotion\\" album, but other nuggets include \\"World in My Eyes\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\" and \\"Enjoy the Silence\\". DVD2 brings some extras which, frankly, I don't really care all that much for. I do wish that they had added the 2 bonus tracks (including a superb \\"Halo\\") on DVD1.<br /><br />In retrospect, we can now say without much of a doubt that DM era-1993 was DM at its peak. Once you can over the fact that Dave Gahan desparately seeks street-cred (tattoos, long hair, etc.), you have to admit that his voice was better than ever. Adding live drums was a stroke of genius. The songs rocked. Last but not least the stage design by Anton Corbijn was superb. This is a thoroughly enjoyable DVD, and a must for any DM fan. Highly recommended.
0440238609|5.0|This is an exceptional trilogy. The characters are deeply founded. Their world is also wonderfully crafted. The writing, no matter what you think of Pullman's ideas, is beautiful. <br /> <br />I would just like to point out that I think it is amazing how narrow-minded people can be. When you choose to read fantasy, you should realize that it is fantasy. There are some things you might not agree with, such as the portrayal of God. If, however, you choose to criticize the book based on religious principles, you need to take a second look at yourself.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I had heard about this movie from several people and had met mixed feelings. Some thought it was stupid and some thought it was the greatest thing that they had ever seen. Personally, both volumes are among my favorite movies. If you can stand cursing and lots of bloody action, then you're probably going to love this movie. A lot of the bloody parts are exaggerated, but I watch a lot of bloody anime and I was used to that already. My favorite character was Pai Mei. He was neat, and I liked the fact that he was egotistical. ^_^
B00005JNEI|4.0|Of course this is a biased movie, but Moore poses many FACTS that you can draw your own conclusions on. The conservatives are outraged by this movie because it shows the dirty side of their leader. Sorry the truth is so hard for them to swallow. <br /> <br />I'm so tired of conservative rhetoric being thrown about. F9/11 was a refreshing film that finally gave a voice to the people who have been seeing through these lies for years now. Bush may have won this past election, but Moore's work gave the alliance against the regieme more conviction. <br /> <br />THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD!
B0000035E7|5.0|Despite what you might read in some of the other reviews that precede and follow this one, \\"Bleach\\" is an essential album for any Nirvana fan. The sound quality is, needless to say, not even close to the glossy production of \\"Nevermind\\" or any subequent Nirvana releases. Furthermore, aside from \\"About a Girl,\\" no song on this album is really \\"radio-friendly.\\" Therefore, don't expect a logical precursor to \\"Nevermind\\" on this one. As with all of their full-length releases, Nirvana undergo significant changes between this album and the next.  <br /> <br />What you can expect, though, is to gain some insight into Kurt & Nirvana, before all the hype and fame. A complex punk-metal-hard rock hybrid, \\"Bleach\\" rings with an intensity that is not captured in any of Nirvana's subsequent releases. Interestingly though, the intensity and complexity that define this album aren't necessarily obvious at first. Indeed, this is an album that, perhaps more than any other Nirvana album, requires repeated and focused listening. The more one listens to this album, the more he will come to appreciate the album, the band, and the influence that Nirvana has had on rock and roll. <br /> <br />While I definitely encourage every Nirvana fan to purchase this album, people who are relatively unfamiliar with the band's work may be better off purchasing one of their later releases first, and then returning back to \\"Bleach\\" once they have become better acclimated with the band's music. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br />Scoff <br />Negative Creep <br />Big Cheese <br />Floyd the Barber <br />Love Buzz
0735619670|5.0|I never read the first book but I had always heard about how good it was. The 2nd edition is a very good book. A lot of the information contained within the covers is pure common sense that unfortunatly, most developers probably don't follow. McConnell provides an excellent resource in this book.
B00005LB50|4.0|I saw them play in 1966 at The Whisky,and how I got in was nothing short of a miracle.They remain my favorite Band to this day. So, after hearing Neil remark in 1975 that he had unreleased tracks,along with the others,perked my ears right up.How were we to know that we would all reach middle age before getting them?? Neil was the sole effort behind the set,and he gave us what most we have been waiting for. However,I can't give this set 5 stars because of some glaring errors. First,why the repetative Disc 4?? Why were tracks such as \\"Sell Out\\" \\"Extra, Extra\\" \\"I Guess You Made It\\" \\"The Hour Of Not Quite Rain\\" left out?? I was greatly disappointed not to see the 12 min. \\"Bluebird\\" not there(Reportedly, both Stephen & Neil can't stand it).For all of those who never saw them during their short duration, this STILL is an example of what they were like LIVE. The original version of \\"Mr.Soul\\" is a gem.Bruce was the engine that ran The Springfield, and this track shows it. And stop looking for \\"Stampede\\". It never existed.Period. Read the Book that Ritchie and John Einarson wrote. Lastly, whether Neil wants to admit it or not,The Springfield was Stephen's Band.Period.
0375507256|5.0|I don't buy new books.  I only get them as gifts or rescue them from used books stores, library sales, and thrift stores.  I can offer no higher praise for \\"Cloud Atlas\\" than purchasing it, which happened after reading a wonderful review in the Washington Post book review, I marched right out and picked up a copy.  Michael Chabon, one of my favorites, gave it a great review, so I didn't have much to worry about.  The sheer level of brilliance and subtle magic to get these discordant stories to work together blew my mind away.  My copy, which will stay with me a long time, is now with my girlfriend, who's floating up high, using her \\"Cloud Atlas\\" to navigate about.
B000001ELR|5.0|When \\"The Elder\\" flopped and Peter finally left KISS, everybody thought thats the end for KISS. But instead of vanishing forever the \\"creatures of the night\\" emerged from the shadows to deliver their, perhaps best, work. Not only did Eric Carr bring some new, raw energy to the band to start with or the collaboration of Gene with Bryan Adams on \\"War machine\\" left us awe and wonder but by the time \\"I still love you\\" echoed back from the speakers it was crystal clear that KISS is THE BEST and very rightly so.
B000083E79|1.0|Cher is everything that is wrong with music and has been for sometime now. Thirty five years now and a slew of help along the way has given this monster a world wide reputation. If there was the least bit of talent, I'd have no reson to write this review. If you feel the need to buy played out hogwash with no talent for singing or playing any sort of instrument, waste your money here. All I can do is shake my head.
B000001EL7|5.0|Admittably, in over 30 years of \\"Kisstory\\" the line up changed a lot and some of their records like \\"Carnival of souls\\" weren't exactly great BUT \\"Love Gun\\" is kiss at their peak. The cover is brilliant to start with, the little \\"love gun\\" pistol should be worth a fortune today and the songs on this album are all way above average. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Tomorrow and tonight\\" (pretty much neglected by the band itself when it comes to live gigs) or \\"Christine sixteen\\" are not only perfect 70s but perfect KISS. The title track itself is one of the best songs ever written by Kiss. The album portraits KISS' openness towards all individual players as Ace Frehley finally gets to sing on \\"Shock me\\". The 1998 \\"Psycho circus\\" should have sounded like the \\"Love Gun\\" album.

B00005JMUL|5.0|I just went to see this movie last night and I have to say that this is one outstanding movie and creative production!  This is definitely a movie that you have to experience!  The animation in this movie is just outstanding and the characters look SO real.  I felt like I actually knew the girl in the story, she seemed so realistic, and all the children really.  The mannerisms and facial expressions of the children are so close to what children are really like.  Some of the scenes are just breathtaking.  It is nice that they tried to match the 3D animation with the illustrations in the book so closely.  I can't imagine the work that went into this production and I say kudos to the producers/illustrators of this wonderful family film.  I've heard that this movie is also being shown in 3D Imax theatres and wow that would be fantastic.<br /><br />The storyline is also very well done and the sound of the bell is symbolic of the belief in Santa Claus.  It is a movie about the belief in the Spirit of Christmas as well.  One of the 4 main characters believes already, one doesn't believe, one has the wrong idea of what Christmas is about (i.e. getting), and the other is disillusioned.  It is neat to see how these characters are developed and how they achieve that belief in Christmas and Santa Claus by the end of the movie.  It is emphasized that the Spirit of Christmas is inside us.<br /><br />Some of the scenes may be a little frightening for small children.  I found the scene when the train goes on the ice to be a bit scary but maybe this was because I was watching it on a 30 ft. screen!  I think the conductor says 'blazes' a couple of times, and some people may not like the ghost on the train idea or that the children are climbing out of the train (do not to this at home, yikes!).<br /><br />I am definitely going to see this movie again.  I loved it so much I went out and bought the book and the soundtrack both of which are really outstanding.  The movie has retained the flavour of the book and isn't it great that it is motivating more people to read the book!?  This is not just a movie for children, and if you have a childlike heart you will absolutely love it.<br /><br />I want to add that because I am a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing, I tried out the Rear Window Captioning as it was available in one theatre.  The person at the customer service desk gave me a reflector on a stick that fit into my cup holder.  The words were in red at the back of the theatre and I could view these in my transparent reflector.  It was difficult to get the right positioning sometimes, but I can see that it could be very helpful for some people.  That is what RWC beside the movie listings means and also sometimes headphones are also available in those theatres as well.nd isn't it great that it is motivating more people to read the book!?

038572179X|5.0|A monumentally beautiful novel, it stayed with me for many weeks after I had finished it.  Vivid, haunting, incendiary, \\"Atonement\\" creates a separate world which I felt I had paid a brief visit to.  It is difficult to convey in a \\"review\\" the power of this book, I can only hope that it may help someone make the rewarding decision to also become immersed in this reality.  This is not a book one can or should try to rush through, not a page turner, but that should not deter you from a truly great work of art.
B00005JMAH|5.0|There are so many bad (or just plain silly) reviews of this film and that is really sad.  What most people miss is the fact that the style of the books change and mature as the characters grow up (and therefore, so should the films). This is part of the sheer genuis behind Ms. Rowling's work.  For those who want the same sappy kid stuff that made HP popular in the first place, hop in your time machine and fly backward a few years.  For those of you who are interested in the characters growing up and moving forward...enjoy this wonderful film!
B00005JKES|5.0|I didn't want to see Twin Peaks when it first came out because I would have had to start in the middle.  I didn't give it much thought, although I got the soundtrack because the music had made an impression on me back in 1990.  It was a real treat.  The less you know about it before you start to watch it the better.
B0006284JQ|1.0|<br />A greatest hits album from Britney Spears? What's next, a Kanye West anthology? A Christina Aguilera box-set? The current state of pop music frightens me horribly. <br /> <br />See, the phrase \\"greatest hits\\" connotes something redeeming about one's songs. Spears' \\"songs\\" are hardly the \\"greatest\\" of anything, much less redeeming. In fact, much of it (if not all of it) is utterly unlistenable, appealing to the lowest common denominator who hasn't a critical ear and will passively accept the crap MTV and the FM radio shoves them. <br /> <br />But one things for certain: Britney looks fine in that cover picture. Then again, this doesn't help when bombarded by the atrocious beats and sonic hell of her \\"music.\\" Ergo, if you're thinking of purchasing this disc, read my type....WAKE UP AND SNAP OUT OF IT!!!! <br />
6300273199|5.0|I'm a huge fan of AC/DC with Bon Scott on lead vocals, this is the only concert I have ever seen with Bon just before his untimely death in Feb 1980. It's a great concert filmed live in Paris, they rock out sing all the best Bon songs like, \\"Live Wire\\", \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"Let There Be Rock\\",\\"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\\", \\"Walk All Over You\\", \\"Highway To Hell\\" etc... Bon is clad in tattoos, frizzy long hair and his trademark tight ripped up jeans, they are so tight they keep ripping during the show lol! The interviews are really good also. Bon has a wonderful sense of humor, I think he was one of the best hard rock singers and sexy frontman of all time. I think AC/DC was a perfect match Bon's nasty lyircs backed with the power chords and energy of the young brothers. Why isn't this on DVD yet, with extra bonus tracks and lot's more clips of Bon? I think it's about time for a new Bon Scott release! I love BON!!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I did not hear about The Offspring before hearing their catchy songs on the videogame Crazy Taxi. I got \\"Americana\\" as a present and I loved it! Now I am a huge fan of the rock band. This is what I think about each song: <br />1. Intro (0:09) NO GRADE <br />A basic intro. An automated voice says, \\"Welcome to Americana\\". <br />2. Have You Ever (3:56) A <br />An awesome starting song. I love the lyrics and it is extremely catchy. I can really relate to the song, so I listen to it a lot. <br />3. Staring At The Sun (2:13) B <br />I like the beginning, but I really dislike that the song gets really fast. If they kept the same tempo throughout the song, I would have given the song a higher grade. After a few listens, the fast tempo gets less annoying and more fun to listen to. Great music, cool lyrics. <br />4. Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) (3:08) A- <br />This song reminds me a lot of one of the wannabees in my grade. I really like this song because of its great music, funny voices, and good lyrics. The video is also very funny. <br />5. The Kids Aren't Alright (3:00) A <br />This song really makes you think. Very good lyrics and music that enhances the song a lot. I like the line \\"how can one little street swallow so many lives\\". Great chorus, awesome verses. I love this song! <br />6. Feelings (2:52) C <br />I don't really like this song, but it grows on you. Compared to the great songs on this album, you will probably pass this song. The lyrics are not too good, but the fast-paced and the singing is good. The chorus makes up for the not-so-great verses. Not terrible, but the rest of the album is better. <br />7. She's Got Issues (3:48) B+ <br />Slower than most of the other songs on the album, but still a good song. The song is funny and kind of depressing at points. The lyrics are great, the chorus is O.K., and the music accompanies the lyrics well. Good song. <br />8. Walla Walla (2:57) B <br />A song about a friend going to prison. The band makes fun of the persongoing to \\"walla walla\\" which is funny. Great music, and the lyrics are pretty good. The song eventually gets annoying and the other songs on the album are better. <br />9. The End of the Line (3:02) B <br />This song is depressing because it is about death, but with this band's reputation their songs can't get too sad. The music is good and so are the lyrics. Decent song, a good listen. <br />10. No Brakes (2:04) C <br />I don't like this song very much. Kind of annoying. The verses are not too good, but the chorus is. There are much better songs out there, and a lot are on this album. <br />11. Why Don't You Get A Job (2:52) A <br />A funny parody of \\"Obladi, Oblada\\" by The Beatles. Actually, the songs have almost nothing in common, except for the chorus tune. This song is funny, catchy, and has a great video. One of the best songs on the album. <br />12. Americana (3:15) A <br />The beginning of the song is used on the Crazy Taxi menu screen. I like the part leading up to the lyrics, and the lyrics are really good, too. The music is great. This song is one of the best songs on the album. <br />13. Pay The Man (10:21) A <br />The beginning of the song (the part leading to the lyrics) is 3 minutes long. The real rock song starts at 4:53. The lyrics at the beginning are very well written. The rock song is also pretty good, featuring more great lyrics and catchy music. One of the best songs on the album. The song then takes a break at 8:06 and the \\"Pretty Fly Reprise\\" starts at 9:16, which has a mariachi band play the tune to \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\\". What a way to end the album! <br /> <br />Overall, this album gets a B+. There are a lot of awesome songs on the album that makes it one of my favorite rock albums ever. There are some decent songs and two bad ones, but still if you don't buy this album, you'll miss out on a great adventure through rock.

B000008M1P|5.0|After VH1's bands reunited got Vixen back together for a one time performance, an EMI exec at the show decided to re-release their first two albums. God bless you. If you remember when rock was fun and not always anger and pain, when bands like Motley Crue, Poison, and Warrant ruled, then you'll love Vixen. Thanks to EMI, we can now buy these underrated gems. Thank you EMI.
B00005JMUL|1.0|I watched this movie with my family, and after about thirty minutes, I just couldn't figure out why I was still sitting there.  Neither could my three kids.  So we all got up and left and watched another showing of \\"The Incredibles\\" again.<br /><br />What a contrast!  In \\"The Incredibles\\", Pixar deliberately kept to the standard cartoon look in order not to distract from their main focus, which was to create an extremely clever storyline and deeply effecting characters that would just grab hold of the audience.  My vote for the BEST Picture of the Year.<br /><br />In \\"Polar Express\\", you have this expensive $165 million high tech movie that seems to be obsessed with pushing the state of the art in computer graphics, over and above any desire to make a movie that somebody would want to watch.  Tom Hanks once again lends his name to an avant-garde project reminiscent of the old Saturday Night Live skit \\"Bad Theater\\".  Hanks must be having some sort of a mid-life crisis as an actor - as one of the most marketable actors out there right now, he could have his pick of movie projects, and he seems to be stuck in this mode of picking projects simply because they are somehow ground-breaking and new and different.<br /><br />I have read where people have criticized this movie for having creepy looking kids with \\"Dead Eyes\\".  This sort of criticism misses the real point.  Every movie with special effects has holes and slightly off mismatches that reveal the fact that special effects were used.  If the movie is engaging enough, you will not notice these mistakes or mismatches.  For example, it took me multiple viewings of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies before I started to pick up on some of the slightly off special effects.<br /><br />If the movie totally bores you to death, and seems completely pointless to watch, then all of a sudden, these slightly off special effects become the focus of your attention.  This is indeed what happens with \\"Polar Express\\", quite easily.<br /><br />When the singing and dancing waiters came out and started slinging hot chocolate to all the kids, all I could think of was that the feet of the waiters didn't seem to be realistically dancing on the floor of the train.  And that's when I realized, wow, I need to get up and leave, this is just getting really bad, I'm starting to focus on the mistakes in the special effects, I could be doing a zillion better things than that.<br /><br />ARF!  ARF!  To call this movie a dog would be an insult to dogs everywhere.iters came out and started slinging hot chocolate to all the kids, all I could think of was that the feet of the waiters didn't seem to be realistically dancing on the floor of the train.

0425188809|5.0|Watchers is the first book of Dean Koontz that i have read, and it has put a want for more of his work in me. The story is about two science projects, planned to be used as government defences, that escape from their lab. <br />  Travis Cornell runs into the first of the two, a golden retriever with extraordinary intelligence. He keeps the dog, and soon finds out jsut how smar he is, and eventually finds a way of communicating with it. <br />  The other is a beast! it was mixed with several animals, but i wont go further into detail because Koonts seemed to have tried to let our imaginations run away with us as to what the thing looks like in detail, then reveals it at the end.  <br />  Then theres the reclusive, beautiful woman who has been sheltered by her not too mentally stable aunt since she was a child, literally looking out on the world with fear. She meets Travis and the dog, who saves her from being raped by a man who was trying to take advantage of her ignorance. She grows to have a relationship with Travis and the dog.  <br />  Then theres the assassin. A man who kills both for immense pleasure, and for money. But mostly because he thinks he absorbs the life energy of every person he kills, thus thinks that once he hits the limit he'll be immortal. You can make your own mind up on him, ithink he's a plain wacko! <br />  Then, last but not least, theres the cops. One about the project of the two animals, the other has suspicions. the one who knows has to try and find them both before it becomes public.  <br />  Truly a masterpiece of great proportions. The characters are all uniquely different, equally interesting, but by far the dog is my favourite. I gaurantee you you'll fall in love with it yourslef, and wish something like that would happen for real. Who knows, it might have already, as the book shows just how ignorant the world can be, and how blinding the government can be. <br />  And, before i forget, apart from all the character dilemas, and heartfelt suspense, there is unforgetable horror. The book will have you turning on lights befreo you get into bed, looking behind when your walking down your hall or up your stairs and will have you leaping at your own shadow!  <br />  Okay, i've talked too mcuh, so just go out and buy it, sit down and take a deep breath, coz this is not a book you'll forget and one you'll most definitely read again and again.... <br />
B00068IOWM|3.0|Well, sometimes is better to be quiet and not talk to much, isn't it Bono ?. How many times have you listen any artist saying \\"this will be the best record ever made\\" and things like that before ?. Since Pop, in 1997, U2 has used to say the same thing to their new album, and that the reason why I didn't believe at all those wonderful Bono's words about this new album. I have so many ideas about reviewing this album, so I have to order in my mind now...well, here I go.  <br /> <br />First, an overall review, and second, a song by song one.  <br /> <br />This album is near 50 minutes long, intended as a \\"singles album\\", not as a concept album or any other art form. So, to some extent, is pretty ATYCLB ( one of the worst U2 albums ever ), that's quite dissapointing. I don't know why U2 can't make a more art and interesting album, with so many things happening now, like War on Iraq, some U.S scandals like Torture on Iraq, relationship between Saudi Arabian and Bin Laden's family, civil war in some countries in Africa, Mid East, the fall of United Nations after Bush's wish to go war, etc.  <br />Is bassicaly a nice collection of songs, but quite empty and lack of deep, interesting and unexpected moments, etc. Sometimes is pure Rock, and sometimes in slower. Is not Techno at all, also isn't Punk at all. The overall sound is flat, I mean, if you compare ( for example ) Bono's voice sound is pretty the same on every song, unlike many truly awesome records like Radiohead Ok Computer, Pink Floyd The Wall, Led Zeppelin IV, John Lennon Plastic Ono Band. Sound mixer wasn't very smart. The same thing happen with Edge's guitars, when they're distorded sound pretty the same on every distorded chords, and then they're delayed, sound pretty the same too. By the way, Edge is not so creative on this album, I mean, all his guitars are great ( like always ) but you can't find his whole new guitars used on Boy, Unforgettable Fire or Acthung Baby. Many guitars sounds like ATYCLB. Larry's drums and Adam's bass are really filler !!!, I mean, you can't find any such a classic bass like Pink Floyd Money or Another Brick In The Wall, any classic drumming like The Police Message In A Bottle or Roxanne, etc. Truly bad, they seem to be just a boring musicians, without any ideas. The whole album are just Bono, The Edge and some keyboards and strings.  <br />After listening the whole album, is clear Bono's voice will never returned back to Zoo TV times. Is pretty the same singing than ATYCLB, sadly, that's the true. You can realize how he has to \\"fight\\" with his voice to reach higher notes.  <br />For my overall view, my rating is no more than 6/10.  <br /> <br />Song By Song:  <br /> <br />1- Vertigo: Just a Rock song, nothing more. Absolutely empty and pointless song, silly lyrics, flat sound, etc. The Jacknife Remix has so much interesting moments than the \\"master\\" version. Bono's voice should have sounded like Jacknife Remix. Also is a short song, just intended for a hit single. You can't find any deep messages on this song. 5/10  <br /> <br />2- Miracle Drug: What an improvement !!! The best song of the album. Great melodies, great guitars, Bono's voice at the best of the whole album. Is a mid-tempo song, and will be a classic.  <br />10/10  <br /> <br />3- Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own: A typical mid album song, and pretty ATYCLB one. Is very nice, a ballad, with many high guitars and almost no drumming. Nothing to compare with classic ballads like All I Want Is You, One or With Or Without You. Bono's voice is pretty crappy. 5/10  <br /> <br />4- Love And Peace Or Else: What the hell is this ? is this U2 trying to make Pink Floyd's Money or what ?. If that so, they should have done those awesome and classic Gilmour's guitars. A really filler song, the worst of the whole album. Skip the track, the song turns boring and boring. For the first time, Edge is wrong with his guitars, except on the middle \\"quiet\\" part. The only good thing is the ending, should have been longer and with a real guitar solo. Again, Bono's voice should have sounded different. What a crap was the sound mixer !!.3/10  <br /> <br />5- City Of Blinding Lights: Again, another classic of the album. Beautiful song, really great and worth listen. I love it, really love it. Most of the time, when Bono and Edge sing the chorus is something unforgettable and great. That piano like Boy times is cool. Bono sounds far better not trying to reach those impossible high notes for him. The longer song of the album and one of the best. Well done U2. 10/10  <br /> <br />6- All Because Of You: Nice song, so many guitars, between acoustic and electric ones !!. Another song singing in a dual voice style, cool and fresh. The ending is pretty Rattle & Hum song. I know you'll like it. 9/10  <br /> <br />7- A Man And A Woman: Unlike the previous song, this song stars pretty simple in its instruments. Is one of the most different song of the album. Nice instruments, except for boring Larry's drumming...why he is so lazy on this album ?. I think it would have been better a somewhat Peter Gabriel's drumming programming.  <br />The song is really good, but in this version turns somewhat boring, really. 7/10  <br /> <br />8- Crumbs For Your Table: Another dual voice style song, also another highlight moment on the album. Edge's guitars lead the song, and AGAIN Larry and Adam are so lazy...please guys, if you can't play better than this, leave the band and give a chance for younger and far better drummers and bass players !!!. Another \\"long\\" song ( if long is 5 minutes running ). Another song could have sounded pretty different, but is still good. Remains me to some extent ATYCLB Walk On. 8/10  <br /> <br />9- One Step Closer: The 3rd quite song ( since A Man And A Woman ) makes the album  less interesting, really. Basically, a Keyboards song, with almost no drums and few guitars. Another low point of the album, it seems to be a filler song. 4/ 10  <br /> <br />10- Original Of The Species: Many chords used on this song, that's weird, because sometimes is great and sometimes y bad. In The chorus is great, anyway, as well during verses, but in the brigde is bad. Overall is another quite song, making the B-side of HTDAAB clearly lower than the A-Side. Again, Edge's guitars are the best of the song. 6/ 10  <br /> <br />11- Yahweh: After 4 songs somewhat boring if you listen one after another, this one could have put between those ones. Is the last song of the album and ( again ) is a dual voice style. Nice song, but is not a classic. Bono's voice is not his best. Is not an ending like All I Want Is You or Love Is Blindness. When I'm listening this song, I want to put again the highest points of the record, Miracle Drug and City Of Blinding Lights.  <br />6/ 10  <br /> <br />Now is your choice to buy it, but one thing I'm sure of: this is NOT the U2's masterpiece, unlike what Bono said. Is nice, but is not their best.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|While my husband thought this movie was \\"okay\\", I was viewing it through the eyes of the child I become each year at Christmas.  I loved every second of it and thought the storyline and animation was outstanding.  There were only a few minor points (what child would go with strangers - but then again, the movie was set in a different time, when kids played in the street into the dark hours and neighbors could be trusted). <br /> <br />In my opinion, Tom Hanks knew he had the resources to leave this world a Christmas legacy including a few new carols that will undoubtedly become part of our holiday folklore.  I think this project inspired him to leave us this beautiful and wondrous gift.
B00008ADPF|1.0|This is one of the most futile recordings I have ever heard - you will want more than a nickel back if you waste your hard earned money on this sonic foray into nothingness. On the first cut I thought I was listening to Roland O. from Tears for Fears trying to sing to some formula based commercial metal. This is just another in the abyss of commercial thievery - record it and they will come . Unfortunately there are enough uneducated masses to keep this weak scam music going indefinitely.    Flush it and go sack some groceries dorks .
B000055ZB8|5.0|Well, like thousands of frightened and astounded fans before me, Nosferatu impresses as a German-Expressionistic masterpiece.  Certainly it should be ranked in the best twenty films ever made. The date of this version is 1929, but in a recent film about the making of this first vampire movie, Shadow of the Vampire, 2000, they claim 1921, which seems to me from the sets, lady's make up, technology, and photography, that 1921 is the correct date. <br /> <br />The score of this release certainly is driving and enhancing.  The amazing death carriage scene done in reverse negative is unforgettable.  Max Schreck is a geeky, malformed vampire. He is so deformed that Shadow of the Vampire suggests that Max actually believed himself to be a vampire and that Murnau was willing to sacrifice actors and crew members to Max's cravings.  Yes, it's a funny idea, but trust me readers, after seeing Max's vampire, I'm not sure he doesn't dine on cast blood. <br /> <br />German Expressionism is the juxtaposition of cubic forms on everyday scenes to enhance an underlying dread.  This dread in Germany after WW1 expresses primitive fears of a society in a tailspin, starvation, poverty, a fear that God has forsaken you to the forces of evil.  Although Stoker's vampire is of the 19th century, it is difficult to tell whether we are watching rural Germany of the 19th or 20th Century.  F.W. Murnau is one of the greatest directors of all time. <br />
B00011F5DK|5.0|I saw this game on NBC's Today Show almost a year ago and have been looking for it ever since.  Finally found it and WE LOVE IT!  Our family has played this game nearly every night since receiving it in the mail.  The rules of the game are simple and CAN be learned in less than a minute, as advertised.  It is a tricky game that requires stategy and forethought, but it is a great challenge and alot of fun.  A great choice!
B00000JQFM|5.0|My first guitar teacher exposed me to \\"Satch\\" for the first time.  She encouraged me to learn Midnight and other bits of songs from this disc.  Since then I've learned to play many of the tunes and parts of all of them. <br /> <br />Satch inspired me to develop my own style.  He's not my only influence (I also love blues, jazz, and classical), but he's certainly been the strongest.  I've written a number of instrumental tunes that have a bit of the Satch flavor, but I've borrowed from a lot of other musicians as well.   <br /> <br />I definitely recommend his other discs as well.  Crystal Planet, The Extremist, and Flying in a Blue Dream are probably the most accessible, but the others are great too.

B000063DFN|5.0|Powerslave, being Maidens peak, is what they should be remembered by. After two really good albumns, Beast and Piece of Mind, they came out with this sucker. Unlike the two before it this album is without one filler. Theres perfect muscianship, with some of Maidens best solos(Aces) and song writing(Rhime). THIS is it; before synths, before Blaze, before age, the perfect album. <br />As is common with Maiden we have a good hard rocker from the begining. It starts off with one of the best on the album, Aces High. Then a sort of overrated song but still great Two Minutes to Midnight. Then Maidens best instrumental Losfer Words(Lost for words*cough*). Flash of the blade and the Duelists are two awesome songs with some great guitar work. Back to the Village is probably the weakest song on here but, when the weakest is that good it says something about the album. Powerslave, tied for the best song, has a very egyptian feel to it and has an interesting slower section in the middle. Maybe the best Iron Maiden song of all time, Rhime of the Anchient Mariner the 13 minute epic closes off the album. Wonderful lryics, and lots of different feels to the song it ends the album perfectly. <br />If you like Maiden, metal, or good music do yourself a favor and pick this up.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The Matrix was a brilliant movie. The sequels were not. After watching Matrix Revolutions I really wished that the Wachowski <br />brothers had just stopped with the first one. This is ghastly. The audience cares about Neo, Morpheus and Smith so what did we get? Morpheus being weak and unsure (and pretty out of shape. Larry Fishbourne obviously hadn't been to the gym) endless scenes with annoying side characters, and horrible cliches. Was the crusty old military man scolding and then having to rely on the plucky kid scene necessary? Were the endless scenes of the commander talking slowly to the counsel needed? And as for the slow talking did anyone notice what a bad actress Jada Pinkett Smtih is? She spends the entire movie scowling and speaking her laughable lines very slowly. While I'm on the subject of laughable was I the only one who laughed at Trinity's death scene? Considering her injuries she shouldn't have been able to talk much less give Neo a pep talk. The battle scenes went on too long and weren't original in the least. This whole thing was just a lumpy mess.
B00024BHTC|5.0|When I went to Estonia and Finland this past summer, I never knew that I would come back with such a treasure as this CD. I had previously never known about Nightwish, let alone any operatic metal bands, but since getting Once, I have become a huge fan, getting all their CD's and listening to them constantly. But why has this musical change occurred to a person who has never even heard the name before? Well, I first heard the last minute or so of \\"Nemo\\", their first single off Once, on a ferry to Stockholm while watching the European MTV channel, and after writing the name of the band on my hand, I made it my goal to find the album that song was from and get it for myself. I then, when I got back to Estonia, rushed to the nearest record store, and, after listening and being blown away by the first track (\\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\") I quickly bought it. Amazed was I at the creativity of this band. Tuomas (the guitarist and main composer) had extended beyond the stereotype of symphonic metal bands just being a rock band with a synthesized string part, and wrote the perfect songs for combination with a real full orchestra. Also, with Tarja's perfect operatic singing, a certain professional effect is added that is very rare to find in popular music nowadays. Even with her as an example, all the band members are true musicians, regardless of what songs they play, which makes the songs all the more amazing to listen to. Now, before I truly listened to CD, I was even then verily impressed at the layout of the album. The cover was done very well, with a lighter and more simplistic, angelic design which is different than their old albums, surrounded by another cover encircling it. For the songs now, I rated them on a 5 point basis, and then gave each of them a brief commentary. <br /> <br /> <br />Dark Chest of Wonders 5/5 <br /> <br /> This is the one track off the album that affirmed my obsession with the album. The song starts off with an introduction of the concept of the concept of the album which is carried on throughout the album, as Tarja speaks the words \\"Once I had a dream...and this is it\\" on top of a bright cascade of bells, before it starts right into an amazing, and heavy guitar riff. This, topped off with the orchestra coming in as well, adds an essence to the intro that makes you want to listen to the whole album. When the vocal comes in, an exchange between the chorus and Tarja's operatic singing is a very creative twist on the singing. The song continues on, but the most impressive part I find in this song is the orchestra arrangement after the bridge. This is absolutely breath-taking, and it is probably the reason that I bought the album. This blend of Nightwish's core instruments and the orchestra is just perfect. This song is a masterpiece in itself. <br /> <br />I Wish I Had an Angel  4 /5 <br /> <br /> When I first got the album, I never particularly liked this song at all. Out of all the songs, in fact, this was the only one I would skip, but I guess after listening to it enough, it grew on me. I would have to say the most impressive factor on this track is the harmony in the vocals. Though Marco's voice doesn't quite match up in the ranks with Tarja's, the melody itself is very well done, and the bouncing back and forth adds an echo-like effect. If there was one factor to change in this song, it would be the screaming in the middle and end of the song. Especially in the middle, I don't find that it particularly fits the song very well. <br /> <br />Nemo    5/5 <br /> <br /> Being the first single off the album, one would suppose that this song is very catchy. Verily, I would presume so, for even I was drawn to Nightwish through this song. But as well as this, the song is a musical masterpiece. With enrapturing harmony and singing by Tarja, as well as surreal keyboards in the beginning, a very oceanic and arctic setting is placed in one's mind. The chorus in the song is one of the highlights in the album. Along with being catchy, it is absolutely breath-taking and, well just amazing. Even for a real life example, a fellow band member and I used to work at a restaurant together, and he started to hum the chorus to Nemo and as soon as he did, everyone else was asking what the name of the song was and they wanted then to have the song. All from a simple hum of the melody as well. But anyways, the song itself ends off strong with a beautiful orchestral arrangement. A must listen for any music appreciator in the world. <br /> <br />Planet Hell   4/5 <br /> <br /> A very epic blend of orchestral and choral part starts off this song, as it gradually leads into the heavy portion of the song with the drums coming in. This is a duet between Marco and Tarja and that itself plays very well; even better than in I Wish I Had an Angel. Still, Tuomas' voice could be a bit less harsh, but it's excusable when you notice the composition. I notice that in this song there is less of the band itself, and more orchestration, but that in a way compliments the song very well, for it has a lot more classical roots than most other songs on the album. <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood  3.5/5 <br /> <br /> I can see the attempt that the band made for this song to have a very Native American influence on the songs, and they have done a pretty good job of it. Even so, though, there is something about this song that loses my interest somewhere. There is not much of Tarja singing in this song, but that is made up with a beautiful orchestration. The one thing that prevents me from giving this song a five is the fact that there is not too much variation in the song. True, there might be different versions of it throughout the song, but they don't differ enough to keep me interested for 8 and a half minutes. Also, the chanting at the end, though a very fine idea, went on for too long. <br /> <br />The Siren   4.5/5 <br /> <br /> The Siren is a very fine track off the album. Personally, I wouldn't think it too farfetched to say that this song has the most beautiful singing from Tarja. The heavenly background vocal countermelody sung by Tarja in the chorus creates a very ethereal setting. Also, another highlight is the violin solo in this song. Surprisingly, it fits the song extremely well, and is indeed one of the most creative violin solos I've heard (this is coming from a violinist) in a while. The only somewhat bad thing is that Marco's voice in this song, though actually quite nice, is a tad too rough for its counterpart. <br /> <br /> <br />Dead Gardens   3/5 <br /> <br /> I would have to say that this is the dullest point on the album. The most particular reason for this is the guitar part. Especially with the overly long repetition of the riff at the end, it isn't overly creative. It is not an awful song, but it lacks excitement. <br /> <br />Romanticide   5/5 <br /> <br /> For all heavy metal fans, this is the song for you. Undoubtedly the heaviest song on the album, the guitars on this track are beyond supreme. Fast and striking, the guitar, and the drums, combined with the almost scary chorus combine to make an amazing heavy prelude to Ghost Love Score, and a definite make-up for Dead Gardens. The change of tempo into the much faster and heavier portion at the end is also a wonderful addition, and help lead into... <br /> <br />Ghost Love Score  6/5 <br /> <br /> Music at its finest. No words do I have to say on how amazingly amazing this song is. The absolute perfect arrangement of orchestra, chorus, and band leave this ten minute long epic near the top of my list of favorite songs of all time. Starting with an amazing orchestral entrance, the listener's mind is enraptured and then lead into what is possibly the greatest chorus of all time. Harmonies that leave you trying to hold back tears of realizing that perfection is actually attainable flood the chorus. But it isn't a repetitive song, if one is worried about that. The song progresses throughout many different creatively put together sagas. One common feature with all of these is the beautiful and epic orchestral accompaniments that strengthen them. If heaven is anywhere on Earth, it is in this song. <br /> <br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan 5/5 <br /> <br /> This song shows that Nightwish is capable of more than just heavy metal. Following Ghost Love Score, this song is a perfect slowdown. Using their original Finnish language instead of English, the song shows a certain sense of patriotism, which is shown throughout the song, especially in Tarja's voice. A definite highlight, however, is the cello solo, which is very suiting for this song and is filled with much more emotion than a guitar ever could in this song. Overall, the main factor that makes this song so amazing is the orchestral arrangements.  <br /> <br />Higher than Hope  4/5 <br /> <br /> A nice, though not amazing, ending to the album. Composed entirely by Marco, the guitarist, there is a bit of a difference in the actual sound in this song. Starting off with a seemingly innocent and quiet intro, the vocals are accompanied by the orchestra and acoustic guitar mainly until the chorus, where the true root of the song is revealed. With a slow, but emotional chorus, the laments of the words are vented through a heavy and march-like melody. Though not my first choice for the final song, it serves its purpose, and is a valiant effort on the part of Marco to compose for the band. <br />
B000001DYD|5.0|I picked this album up seemingly by accident--I was travelling in the south of Ireland and one of my hostesses lent me a \\"blank\\" tape onto the first side of which I recorded Doolittle.  Several weeks later, I fell asleep on a bus and the recorder switched to the other side, revealing the hidden album--I was kicked out of sleep by Rid of Me's powerful chorus, and, needless to say, the remaining months of my travels were perforated by PJ Harvey's delicious howl. <br /> <br />That was over ten years ago now, and I still listen to this album regularly (read: at least twice a month.)  Throughout her career, PJ Harvey has consistently impressed me, each album unconsciously adventurous & profound, yet strangely familiar.  I highly recommend her work.
B00068IOWM|1.0|what did have to happen to U2 for they could make a so deficient and lack of honesty album? what happened with those 4 young man from Dublin who reached directly at our hearts and minds, with 3 chords and the truth? all that illusion, all that magic, all that youth, all that energy, and those hymns are had lost, television has been turned off and the white flags have been put out. It gives so much pain, really, because I'm a die hard fan, and I really believed in they were going to release their best <br />album, but that hasn't happened. I don't know how to do now, if <br />return waiting, or better to begin to listen to another more honest and new music. Despite with Pop they sent acid critics towards that supermarketing world a while ago, they have settled down in that world of the commercialization nowadays. I feel so bad, U2. <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|I love this album.  I was persuaded by a friend of mine who lives in the UK to buy this cd.  I was hooked right away.

B0002XNT0I|5.0|Back in 1993, AIDS had been in the forefront of the news and everyone's minds for quite a while. Still, a major Hollywood movie still hadn't dealt with the subject matter. Sure we had some incredible films like \\"Longtime Companion\\" and the stunning \\"Parting Glances\\" (both which I highly recommend as truly visionary cinema), but they were more independent and not likely seen by mainstream audiences. Finally, with the foresight of Jonathan Demme, and the star power of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, Philadephia roared onto the screens and into our hearts. And now, finally, we have a DVD treatment that this movie truly deserves.<br /><br />Andrew Beckett, high priced lawyer of a top Pennsylvania law firm, suffers from AIDS quietly at the beginning of the film. A lesion betrays his secret quickly, leading to his dismissal. Firing back, Beckett attempts to secure the services of Joe Miller, a personal injury lawyer with an everyman reputation. At first rejecting his offer and even pouring salt in his wounds by mocking him, Miller is converted to the cause after witnessing subtle discrimination in a library. It is through Miller that everyone can approach this story, and it is through Beckett that we learn dignity and we learn pain.<br /><br />Much as been said about Tom Hanks' Academy Award winning performance as Beckett, and Denzel Washington's wonderful portrayal as Miller. Together, the two are an acting powerhouse, both equally dynamic and compelling in their characters. One can only wish they would team up again sometime in the future. At any rate, they are supported by a fine ensemble, starting with the late Jason Robards to the rarely seen and much missed Joanne Woodward, whose performance will reduce you to tears in seconds.<br /><br />Included in this DVD package are several documentaries detailing the development of the movie. The director's and writer's commentaries shed wonderful light into the process that went into making the movie. The few deleted scenes are wonderful to see, especially during a \\"settlement\\" negotiation between the parties. One very poignant thing mentioned in the documentary were the number of people suffering with AIDS that were employed in this movie, both in front of and behind the scenes. Very touching.<br /><br />But this isn't just a movie about AIDS. This is a movie that soars above the simple \\"movie of the week\\" syndrome, and dares to address such things as tolerance, acceptance, getting over your fears, and welcoming people for who they are.  It's amazing how relevant and meaningful those messages are today. In a climate of unacceptance and intolerance to others, hopefully Philadelphia's essential meanings will continue to ring as a bell of Liberty, and not just in the streets of the town of Brotherly Love.cenes are wonderful to see, especially during a \\"settlement\\" negotiation between the parties.

6302256704|3.0|You don't need a lot of brainpower to absorb this movie. It goes for the cheapest laughs it can find. To name three: pratfalls, pratfalls and more pratfalls. Sometimes it works -- especially when Lloyd Bridges is on the screen -- and sometimes the jokes fall flat. You're bound to get a few chuckles, and at only 90 minutes, it's doesn't require a big time commitment. Some of the jokes are so quick, you might have to watch it over to get them.

B00005ALP6|3.0|The film \\"My Fair Lady\\" is an acceptable adaptation of the satire \\"Pygmalion\\" of G.B. Shaw. Acceptable because the whole essence of satire is kind of watered down in the musical; yes indeed some script was used from \\"Pygmalion\\" but still the attitude that the actors portrayed at some moments were not as \\"satirical\\" as in the book. My fair Lady is a fabulous musical itself, but if compared to the book \\"Pygmalion\\" it is not the most exact depiction of it. I believe that G.B. Shaw's ironic and satirical humor is not shown as much as it should be; the whole idea of illustrating \\"Pygmalion\\" should be placing as a main theme in the movie, the satire of the various topics in the book like the relationship between Higgins and Eliza, The deserving poor in contrast to the undeserving poor like Mr. Doolittle, etc. The strange affection /hate relationship between Eliza Doolittle and Higgins is one of the main things that represent the rare, yet exceptional factors of G.B. Shaw's satirical themes. In My Fair Lady the irony in the relationship is shown in a different way; Eliza openly shows her care and affection for Higgins during one of her musical solos, while in \\"Pygmalion\\" this wasn't shown by Eliza in such a direct way, instead it is written in way that the reader is to assume of it. Another way in which the marvelous musical My fair Lady, as I said before a great movie itself; that is, if it weren't to portray \\"Pygmalion\\", makes a change at the ending of the movie; the ending of Pygmalion clearly shows G.B. Shaw's traditionally sarcasm take place; as Eliza leaves Higgins house, marries a middle class young man, gets to run a flower shop but can't really handle the job, and ironically there was still a part of her that missed Higgins even though he's behavior towards her wasn't the best. Eliza has to adapt herself to the middle class, when all she knew about now was high class.  It was as if she were trapped inside a world she didn't want to be in anymore and didn't know anymore. In My Fair Lady Eliza gets to stay at Higgins house and not got through the changes and desires she couldn't have as in the book.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I have always heard good things about Shania Twain but I confess I never actually got around to buying one of her CDs. Man, did I cheat myself! Her singing here is electric, full of positive energy and emotion. She emotes so well and her intensity blew me away! Wow!<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Forever And For Always,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good,\\" and UP!\\"--a triumphant start! Shania packs a powerful punch here! I was hooked by the end of just these three songs! GRIN The CD song set includes two really nice versions of \\"Party For Two,\\" one with Mark McGrath and the other with Billy Currington. Terrific! I also love the beat on \\"Don't Be Stupid.\\" Great song!<br /><br />I also believe my favorite song would HAVE to be \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" Its positive energetic upbeat rocks hard and really well. The musical arrangement on \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" is totally awesome and of course the words make an important statement about focusing on the person in a love affair rather than material goods.<br /><br />I can see why every song here either has been a hit or will be a hit really soon! I am definitely adding more Shania Twain CDs to my collection! Her strong, powerful and heartfelt singing makes her so uniquely genuine! This is a gift she shares with us all! Just this one CD and I was HOOKED! GRIN
B0006284JQ|2.0|I appear to be the only one here not blinded by the pin-up photo of Britney on the cover of her CD.  Calling this album \\"Greatest Hits\\" is an understatement on many levels: first of all, most of the songs on this item were just her singles, so a more suitable title would have been \\"Singles,\\" much like Mariah's #1s.  Second of all, Britney's music is mostly electronically enhanced lyrics over loud, heart-racing beats that cause the listener to get caught up in wanting to dance and forget about listening to the words or the sound of her vocal range.  For such a young artist, it is premature to release a CD of hits: it is as if she is just giving up.  In my opinion, the strongest songs of hers are not even on this CD.  Some of my favorites have been Shadow, Not a Girl (on the album), Brave New Girl, and Overprotected-- songs that show her softer side (the real girl behind the glamorous, overly sexualized image).  Now that Britney has admitted she will take time away from her career, this album seems like a way to remind the public she has made a ridiculous amount of money in the past few years, and she is ready to capitalize again on the same songs that brought her popularity, airplay, and infamy.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I was anxiously awaiting the PoA movie being as it's my second favorite book in the series (Goblet of Fire being my favorite).  When I finally saw it, I was not disappointed.  I loved the new setting (especially the lake) and the darker atmosphere, especially the dementors (they were extremely scary and chilling).  The hippogriff was exactly how I pictured it in the book, and the scene with the Care of Magical Creatures class and Harry riding the hippogriff quickly became my favorite scene.  Cuaron did a great job directing (I loved the \\"time\\" symbolism throughout), and the young actors are getting better and better with each movie.  However, there is a reason I am giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5.  In my opinion, very important details were left out.  We are never told the significance of the Marauder's Map or Harry's patronus.  In place of these very important details are scenes which are cute but unnecessary, such as the choir singing and the boys of Gryffindor eating sweets which temporarily make them sound like animals.  Also, I thought the movie was a little too fast-paced and choppy.  It seemed that one minute it was winter, and the next it was spring.  Overall, even though the movie had its faults, it is an incredible film and, in my opinion, the best Harry Potter film to date.

B00005U8EM|3.0|Once the film starts flowing properly, and it gets less repetitive, and goes into different situations (including Phil trying to commmit suicide which I do NOT remember from the TV version!), it's a lot better. The beginning, for me, does get kinda boring. Some people might think this kinda film might run out of steam and inspiration, but it's full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity.<br /><br />This is one of Bill Murray's best movies ever, he is at his cynical best in this, and totally tops anything like Scrooge or Ghostbusters. I love the way he tries to change for the better, and still manages to get slapped in the face by Andie McDowell loads!<br /><br />What gets so tedious about this movie, is how many days are actually shown, and how he manages to find out everything about everyone. Obviously, it couldn't actually show everything that happened, otherwise we'd all still be watching the movie, but he is said to go through February 2nd, 34 times. There were many more days implied, for example how he knew everyone so well in the diner, but only 34 days were actually shown. It's never actually explained in the movie (maybe in the commentary, I never watch those), why Phil actually came to be reliving February 2nd over and over again, and why that particular day. Particularly since he'd done the broadcast from Punxsutawney for three or four years, I always wonder why that particular year. Early drafts of the script explained the cause of Phil's weird experience: a disaffected ex-lover called Stephanie cast a spell on him to teach him a lesson.<br /><br />In one scene, Phil throws himself from the bell tower of a high building.

B00008WT5C|5.0|This has got to be THEE greatest ACDC album of all time!!!!!Back In Black has nothing on this baby!!!As good as BIB was,the band was robbed of it's raw,primal,very live sounding recordings.Fortunately for LTBR,it captures ACDC at their prime with Bon Scott(the greatest).All of the songs feature catchy,sleazy,yet genius throat scratching lyrics by Bon and some of the most roughest pulse-pounding guitars put down on record in the 70s.The sound is so,so,raw and it's just what makes all of ACDC's 70s recordings essential stuff.Awesome heavy metal album ahead of its' time and all of the songs freakin' rock!  <br /> <br /> <br />LONG LIVE BON SCOTT!!!!

079213690X|5.0|Good movies like these are hard to find nowadays. I rented a bunch of videos and this was the only video that I wasn't disappointed in. The rest were junk and a waste of money, not worth a second watch.  <br /> <br />Not only does this movie combine excellent, flawless acting, but also directing, movie shooting, and all else. I have yet to think up of a flaw that this movie has created. Nothing important.  <br /> <br />The gore in this movie was great! It might seem nasty to some but it makes the movie more graphical and realistic, also shows that the directors really try to bring out the real picture when it comes to love and war.  <br /> <br />I'm sleepy but other than that, this movie was very good, a rare movie definately worth the 5 stars if not more.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Considering the fact that Britney isn't even middle aged and has only released four albums, many people would be quick to ask, \\"Why in the hell is she coming out with a greatest hits album?\\" I would agree with those people if it weren't for a few obvious yet overlooked reasons. <br /> <br />First, Britney has been in the music business, with her first album \\"..Baby One More Time\\" released overseas first, for over ten years. She's done four world tours and numorous domestic and overseas intermissions. <br /> <br />Also taking into consideration the fact that although she came after a generation of stars that would put many of the Biblical charactors to shame, she has held her own and made a mark on the current generations way of thinking as well as the styles of music that we hear. <br /> <br />Most of those that feel that Miss Spears is too \\"new\\" to have a greatest hits album must not remember the fact that after only four studio recorded albums, Madonna released the IMMACULATE COLLECTION only to return for a new generation of listeners (she now has three total). Also, Janet (who I believe Britney most emulates), signed with a new label and upon departure, released DESIGN OF A DECADE. She had only released three prior albums and has since released three more and sold out tours worldwide. <br /> <br />I mention all of this to say, give her a break. After all, she has been in the spotlight since she was eleven years old, she's done what she had to do, caused some fodder for the press and has enough number one singles to make up a collection of great hits. <br /> <br />And besides, if that many of you didn't like her, how would she have such a collection?

But this is the second <br />cd in a row that has been good. I loved Permanent Vacation <br />and this one is also good.... It was the last real good <br />album they made before Honkin on Bobo. Is there some <br />commerical stuff here? Yes! Is it as good as TITA or <br />Rock? It's CLOSE! You got some sexual songs here like <br />YOUNG LUST but my favorite is FINE! Song is underrated <br />and kicks major @ss! Other favorites are \\"My Girl\\" and <br />the slow song \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" which reminds me of <br />\\"Uncle Salty\\" from Toys in the Attic. If you are new <br />to Aerosmith you probably want to checkout the first <br />4 albums first.... But make sure that you don't listen <br />to the trash from Get a Grip-Just Push Play.

B0002858YS|4.0|...we'd all be dead. This is an incredible album, especially considering it's their debut! Of course the singles are great, but the other songs are kick-ass as well. Sure, there are about three songs that have the same back-beat as \\"Somebody Told Me\\" but who cares?!? Melodically, harmonically and lyrically, every song is unique. I'll break down the songs: <br /> <br />1. Jenny was a Friend of Mine- 6/10 Cool tune. I dig the sound FX in the intro. Good opener but all-in-all, I don't think it's one of the strongest songs on the album. Catchy chorus. <br /> <br />2. Mr. Brightside- 9.5/10 Great song! Lyrics, meldody, hook, beat.. it's all top-notch! Who frickin' cares that he repeats the lyrics from the 1st vs. in the second one? They're good lyrics. Anyone who's ever been jelous or had someone cheat on them can relate. I especially like the optimistic lryics. <br /> <br />3. Smile Like you Mean it- 10/10! This is quite possibly the best song on the record! The lyrics are great; \\"Save some face.. you know you've only got one.\\" The chorus is the best. The haunting chorused guitar (it could be synth) perfectly complements the vocals. This song is absolutely perfect! <br /> <br />4. Somebody Told Me- 9/10 If you don't have the album this could be the only song you know (and maybe Mr. Brightside). It's a great song but, I've just heard it so many times that I'm kinda tired of it right now. I'm sure I'll love it again in a week or two. However, when I first heard it, I couldn't listen to it enough. Great hook... dig the 80's techo/dance beat! <br /> <br />5. All these Things I've Done- 8/10 The chorus really has a Beatle's feel. I love the vs. where he goes to the minor 7th after singing down the maj. 7th (for you music theory nerds).. very melodic. \\"I got soul but I'm not a solider\\" great stuff. <br /> <br />6. Andy, You're a Star- 4/10 This is probably the weakest song on the record simply because of the intro. It takes a little while to get going. Once it does it ok, though. It's just slow and doesn't have the energy the other tracks have.  <br /> <br />7. On Top- 8/10 This song rocks and is a lot of fun! Man, the synth is so great on this song! The vocals are great too. Play it in your car, turn it up and drive fast!  <br /> <br />8. Change Your Mind- 7-10 Lyrically, this song is really strong. It sounds a little like the Strokes, but not really.. still has the Killer's feel. Good tune. <br /> <br />9. Belive me, Natalie- 6/10 This is probably the 2nd weakest song on the record. The chorus is good but the verse vocal melody just isn't very good. Some of the notes are questionable. Nonetheless, a fairly good song overall. <br />  <br />10. Midnight Show- 7/10 Instrumentally, this song sounds the most like \\"Somebody..\\" Kick ass, chorus. Really pumping. Another one to drive fast to... as per Branden's instructions; \\"Drive faster boy!\\" <br /> <br />11. Everything Will be Alright 7/10 This song took awhile to grow on me because it's slow and the vocals in the verse sound out of tune at points. After several listens, I've realized that the dissonance is intentional and the vocals aren't really out of tune, it's just a byproduct of the chorus effect that makes them sound that way. The chorus is absolutely great; heartwrenching even. It's melancholoy yet optimistic, bittersweet, which is how a great ending should be. <br /> <br />Buy this record! It's well worth the money! <br />
B00005JN4O|5.0|I saw this film at a sneak preview last Thursday night, and was utterly enthralled with it from start to finish. Johnny Depp shines in one of the best performances of his career as J.M. Barrie, a Scottish playwright, who after coming off of his last poorly reviewed play, struggles for inspiration. And this he finds, in the minds and hearts of the Lywellyn-Davies family, a widowed Sylvia Lywellyn-Davies, and her four young boys, whom he meets by chance in a nearby park. The children are immediately enthralled by Barrie's childlike manner and his wild imagination, (Barrie equally so) and he soon becomes a prominent figure in their lives, and the life of Sylvia, much to the gossip of the town, and the dismay of Barrie's wife, Mary. From his relationship with this family, Barrie soon begins to write the play that would remain a classic forever, \\"Peter Pan\\".  <br /> <br />One of the things I liked best about this film are the performances, which are incredible. Johnny Depp, who has been named an Oscar contender for Best Actor, is perfect in the role of the quirky and imaginative Barrie. As Sylvia, Kate Winslet is astounding, and the supporting cast of Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie, and Radha Mitchell are a pleasure to watch. However, the performance that truly blew me away in \\"Finding Neverland\\" was that of Freddie Highmore. At the mere age of twelve, he seems to embody innocence, and is captivating and moving as Sylvia's youngest son, Peter. Keep an eye on this young man, he can next be seen in another beloved tale, \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" as Charlie Bucket.  <br /> <br />The world of J.M. Barrie was rich in color, life, and imagination, and the filmmakers in \\"Finding Neverland\\" have done a brilliant job of bringing that world to life. This film manages to make the audience laugh and cry, and truly feel for the characters onscreen, which is something that is not achieved often. I would truly recommend \\"Finding Neverland\\" for anyone wanting a terrific story, wonderful performances, and, of course, a little magic to brighten an evening.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie was a masterpiece. I'm a devoted Harry Potter fan, and believe thoroughly that Alfonso Cuaron has brought the intangible magic of Rowling's storytelling to the screen intact, not cheapened and dulled to a nub as Columbus had done. Most Potter-holics will tell you that this film ultimately is flawed because some of the book's large points aren't covered in this film, such as the backstory of the Marauder's and the creation of the map, and the lack of the paternal link with the stag form of Harry's Patronus, and the omission of Harry's talk with Dumbledore at the end of the book. Well, the movie doesn't suffer one bit. And as an admitted Potter-holic myself, knowing these things were missing didn't affect my ability to enjoy the film or my astonishment at Cuaron's remarkable accomplishment. He has created a work of art that rivals the source material's emotional impact. Rowling herself has stated that she loves this film, and was astonished at how fundamentally Cuaron understood what she was trying to communicate with this book. <br /> <br />The acting has improved immensely in this film, thanks in large part to Cuaron's expert tutelage, such as having Radcliffe watch Truffaut's THE 400 BLOWS, to get a sense of an artist's filmic depiction of the pains of adolescence and the fear of growing, (Truffaut's famous freeze-frame ending at the conclusion of THE 400 BLOWS also informs the homage of Cuaron's ending: a freeze-frame of Harry speeding off on his new Firebolt broomstick). He worked with the young trio very closely to help develop their friendship on-screen in a more natural fashion. The children in this film act more like real kids than in almost any other film intended for children. Dumbledore finally has the sly, devious glint in his eyes that you envision from the series, instead of just the grandfatherly twinkle. Emma Thompson's hippie-Divination teacher is lovingly perfected. Lupin's paternal rapport with Harry is heartbreaking, and the sense of cruel injustice which tears him from Harry's life at the end, as well as the heartache of Sirius' departure, is delivered with an emotional honesty absent from the first 2 films. <br /> <br />Cuaron's visual style is perfectly wedded to the source material, letting the sadness, anger, alienation, and confusion of adolescence, color the palette of the film with deep blues, greens and grays, sparkling silvers and inky, shadowy blacks. The ornately detailed interiors, with their improved dramatic lighting and vast, expansive depths, coupled with the lushness and rugged naturalism of the new outdoor locations and surroundings seen in this film, are brilliantly employed; the world of Hogwarts inside and out now matches the baroque majesty conjured by the reader's imagination when poring through Rowling's complex structures on the page. Cuaron's superior filmic vocabulary enables him to put irises, superimpositions, widescreen framing, wide-angle lensing, fluid camera movements expertly utilizing cranes and dollys, to the task of capturing Hogwarts in all it's magical, menacing, awe-inspiring glory. The conjuring of the Patronus, and Sirius flying off into the moonlit sky on the wings of Buckbeak, are two of the most goosebump inducing, heartbreaking scenes in the world of fantasy film. The greatness of Cuaron's approach, visually, emotionally, thematically, can be felt in the tenderness of Lupin telling Harry about his parents on the bridge and during his attempts to teach Harry how to conjure a Patronus, and when he and Sirius look longingly at the Hogwarts castle from the forest, together in a quiet, contemplative serenity. Cuaron has truly done magic of the most advanced kind here.
B000002IU9|4.0|Any band, especially metal that can lay down and record a twenty-eight minute epic that is based on the tale of Homer's 'Iliad', the disc's opener, \\"Achilles, Agony & Ecstasy In Eight Parts\\" must be given credit where credit is due. What a concept album. On the track \\"Death Of Patroclus\\", vocalist Eric Adams puts some emotion about the pain in which Achilles endures when his best friend gets slain by the evil Hector. A couple of the CD's rockers I also liked were \\"Ride The Dragon\\" and \\"Power Of The Sword\\". This was the band's seventh lp. Might be their best work since 1984's 'Hail To England'. If you are looking for some fine earth-shattering heavy metal, look no further.

The mind, beholding Quality, or Tao, is all there is.  After 4 reads and 15 years, I finally got it.  It's super-simple, yet the hardest thing to accept.  But once you do, watch life's Gordians knots fall apart.         Thank you Mr. Pirsig, for your intellectual pit-bulledness in the face of Plato's inversion.        The book's highly rich parallel structure is poetically satisfying.        Why did the author collapse?  He paralyzed under two fundamental reversals at once: philosophical conversion to Quality from Truth, and, moral conversion from power to \\"mu\\"?       My opinion is that if he had been in the right hands at the time, he would have pulled out ok, ie, without the shocks.  P.S.: It's Monism.
B000001G5H|5.0|Contrary to popular misconception: Chopin wasn't an effeminate, swooning, perfumed-hanky kind of composer. Part of what makes him such a titan is the intellectual steel invisibly undergirding even the most tenderly melodic Nocturne to issue from his pen. What makes the Pollini recording so definitive - beyond even his dumbfounding chops - is the clarity and vigor with which he articulates this aspect of the music. Trust me: if Freddy was still around, he'd sniff disdainfully at those candelabras-and-moonbeams posers turning his compositions into runny Camembert. *This* is the way he wanted his music played. Bravissimo, Maurizio!
0790729652|5.0|Now, as most biased people are, there is always a personal connection one may have to certain films.  This just happens to be mine.  As I have grown older, I can see its flaws in special effects and some in the acting.  However, (for any comic-book-thumping Neanderthal who wants to gripe about its inaccuracy to the comic) let me point out the brilliance of the NEWLY adapted Batman tale.  Somehow, Burton not only managed to capture the brilliantly dark atmosphere of Gotham City, but also managed to turn Batman into a movie classic combined with outstanding actors and your standard \\"action film\\" motif, rather than a campy hero romp.  Why I respect this film, is that it DOES NOT seem like a corny super-hero movie (as some of its subsequent films are), but rather reads to me as a very compelling action film with very interesting and mentally deranged characters.  The atmosphere of the film shows a seedy world, in which the gadgets, although far-fetched, are primitive enough in appearance to give a suspension of disbelief.  Bruce Wayne is wealthy-therefore can manage to have recourses beyond others' reach.  Also, his gadgets never get so ridiculous (i.e.: Shark Repellant Bat Spray or flame-resistant capes) that you lose interest.  He has a plane, a great car and a grappling hook!  It keeps it pretty down to Earth, as much as a super hero flick CAN.  As for the acting, of course, Jack Nicholson will always reign supreme in his performance as Jack Napier/The Joker.  He manages to produce a sadistic and creepy persona, while being off-beat and hysterical.  I must also say that Michael Keaton is a fantastic Bruce Wayne/Batman.  He manages to show internal conflict very well and darkness unmatched by the following Batman actors.  Kim Bassinger...sucks.  But she manages to not ruin the movie at all because...well...her role just isn't that interesting.  For anyone who knocks the design of this film, I must remind those critics that it won an Academy Award for its design...so obviously, it has that going for them.  I can only recommend this highly to anyone with any remote curiosity; it will remain forever to be one of my favorite films of all time.bviously, it has that going for them.

0553260111|4.0|I bought this book thinking it would have to be somewhat different from the movie. What we have here is a plot completely different from the movie. Some characters share the same names and positions, but similarities end there. The villain of the book doesn't even appear in the movie.<br /><br />I've read Ludlum before. He likes to balance numerous plots that leave you wishing he would cut it down to 3 or 4. Well, here he is at his absolute best. You want more information. You need more information. It is a clever conceit to make the audience identify with Bourne by having him being an amnesiac. Since he is learning about himself at the same rate as you are learning about him, you come to like him and trust him. I normally just read and don't root characters on (Samwise Gamgee being a very notable exception) but I did with Jason Bourne.<br /><br />The dialogue is for the most part fantastic especially when it comes to the plot. Ludlum is not the most romantic writer and his use of \\"darling\\" get tiresome quick. His pacing is precise. During parts of great action I found myself running through the pages, and the moments of slow deliberate action I read carefully and cautiously. Such manipulation of the reader has to be respected.<br /><br />If you like action or spy novels, you could do so much worse than this.
B00000JZI9|4.0|Silverado is not only a top notch western featuring a very A list cast, but it is important as it was the first \\"A\\" western made in Hollywood in years.  (By A I mean not made for TV.) <br /> <br />The cast list is a who's who of great actors from Glenn , Glover, Costner, Kline, etc... as the Paths of Glenn returning home from Jail, Kline a reformed thief and Glover who comes out west to aid his father converge.  There is some first rate comedy and action.  John Cleese as the Sheriff is played straight but works as comedy as well. <br /> <br />There is nothing to dislike about this film, it is a fine tribute to all the fine westerns that came before it.   <br /> <br />Look for a small cameo at the begining by Sheb Wooley a longtime western actor from the 50's and 60's.  If they could have squeezed in Jack Elam somehow it would have been perfect.
B000089CKH|5.0|Right off the bat this record grabs you, from the stripped down \\"blizzard of 77\\" 's haunting melodies and harmonious vocals, to the melancholy wonder of \\"inside of love\\" achingly poigniant yet lyrically simpistic it echoes sentiments that connect to the listener, something nada surf's previous albums have failed to do for me.  From the gentle lonely fun of \\"high speed soul\\", to the achingly sad \\"killian's red\\", to the somber tone of \\"neither heaven nor space\\", \\"Treading Water\\" happens to be one of my personal favorite cuts on the album.

B00005JMUL|5.0|This film grabs you from the beginning.  The thing that struck me from the beginning that the difference between this new technology and animation, even modern cgi, was that the people actually moved like people which allowed the suspension of disbelief right from the start.  What this caused was my total immersion in the world the film creates, without distraction by disbelief in the characters.  The beautiful story, which retains the spirit of the book, compares favorably with some of the great all ages fantasies of all time such as Willy Wonka and The Wizard of Oz.  Also like those films, Polar Express has a creepy scary quality that children who see this film will remember the rest of their lives.  Have any of us ever forgotten our childhood fear of the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz? <br />     Most of all what this film offers is movie magic.  At it's heart is a  one hour and forty minute train ride to a magical world of ghostly hobos, armies of elves, flying tickets, and creepy dead toys.  So bring your children, reach your own inner child, and go see this film, you won't regret it <br />
0140277447|5.0|After reading some of the reviews posted here I felt compelled to write my own. While some of the information about Nanking in this book may not be completely accurate the fact remains that Japan did commit numerous atrocities in China and other countries. The fact that Japan has refused to take responsibility and formally apologize to each of it's victims is appalling. The typical idiotic Japanese way of thinking is that you can alter the truth. If Japanese textbooks say that the atrocities never happened, then they never happened. Wrong!!! Japan is waiting for all of the victims to die off but the world will always know the truth. I have lived in Japan for seven years and it is the most childish, ignorant, and racist country that I have ever been in. If it were not for my job and foreign friends I would have left long ago. Granted there are many good Japanese but as a whole Japanese society is an ugly thing. Their way of thinking is still incompatible with the rest of the world. They think there are two kinds of people in the world, gaijin (foreigners) and Japanese. It is ok to bully (kill) those outside their group which was witnessed by many during World War II. If Japan had the chance to try and rule the world again they would take it. Unfortunately they have not learned from their mistakes. Japanese people like to think that they have always been a peaceful country. But just seven decades ago they were enslaving their neighbors. Also, they are protected by the US and not allowed to have a military. But they do have \\"defense forces\\". It angers me how Japan always puts out a squeaky clean image and that many people around the world buy it. Granted no country is perfect but you have to acknowledge your mistakes in order to overcome them. The Japanese still don't understand this. But the truth will not go away Japan!
1878424319|5.0|We live in a world that encourages us to make multiple decisions. We worry about yesterday and tomorrow and forget about today. Don Miguel Ruiz expounds ancient Toltec wisdom know as The Four Agreements. This book helped me to realise that if I simplify my life by using these four agreements, and really living them, nothing else matters. Or rather everything else will fall into place. I strongly recommend this book to people who feel overwhelmed by all the self-help literature, or advice from talk shows, etc. Take this step and buy this book, and start living life.
0345350499|5.0|Of all the books I read about Camelot and it's time, MZ Bradley's book comes truest to life. I can almost feel the pathway leading up to the circle of stones that separates the worlds between the old ways and the christian ways. Marion Zimmer Bradley gives a realistic if not feminist look at the history of Cornwall. She makes magic a natural way for the people while explaining why the brutal downfall of Camelot and the disapperance of magic must take place. The voice the author uses through Morgaine is new to common belief. Morgaine now becomes a woman, a mother, and a victim of destiny, bearing the terrible resposibility of a priestess.Definitly one of the best ever.
0679720200|5.0|When asked what I felt was the greatest novel of the twentieth century, this is the one I came up with a some moments for reflection. It is short, highly accesable, and contains some of the most fascinating and exhillerating insights into the nature of humanity. Camus' narrative touch is often breath-taking, and makes you want to learn French just to read the book properly. He manages, as a stylist, things that the likes of Sartre and Proust could only dream about. I love this book perhaps too dearly, but I would reccomend it to any thinking adult.
B0002EXH5O|1.0|I know this has been said in previous reviews, but I must pile on and reiterate, DO NOT BUY THIS REMASTERED VERSION. Some of the vocal tracks have been re-recorded and sound like absolute garbage compared to the original mix. Buy the original Rust in Peace mix that came out on Capitol Records, it has the superior sound. I can't believe Mustaine did this to this album!!!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|i love rufus and i love his music. i love all three albums, and am anxiously awaiting want two.  the only problem that i have is that the volume of this cd seems low.  i have to turn it up louder than my other cd's, whether i'm in the car, or at home.  i'm not sure if i bought a bad cd, or if this was just the way it was recorded. i went to see rufus last year, and the songs from want one sounded excellent.  rufus is a very charismatic performer.
B00005ALP6|3.0|Is it possible for a moviemaker to remain completely faithful to the characters, themes, and techniques depicted by any author in a play? And to what extent is this possible? After watching \\"My Fair Lady\\", directed by George Cukor and mainly based on G.B Shaw's \\"Pygmalion\\", one can say that it is a tolerable, yet not very accurate interpretation of the play since the original satire loses its essence in the movie.  <br />The exaggeration, depicted by the actress personifying Eliza becomes not only irritating but absurd to the extent that it does not reflect Shaw's intention accurately. The actress overstresses not only the accent, which is supposed to be that way, but movements, reactions, etc. as well as the actors personifying Freddy and Higgins.  <br />This satire is mainly expressed, in the play through Higgins and Eliza relationship, or the few conversations between Higgins and Mr. Doolittle; as well as the contrast between the undeserving and deserving poor, or the social meeting in Mrs. Higgins' place. In the play, this technique is abundant and expressed indirectly, yet not irritating as it is in the movie. In \\"My Fair Lady\\", messages from the play are often, if not always, sent to the audience through songs (Eliza's solos for instance) were the director emphasizes the most; where as in the play the use of language combined with satirical sentiment and the ambience emphasized the importance and the message transmitted. It is in the play, where the satire is the main focus, yet not in the movie. <br />Concerning the script, dialogues were, indeed, very accurate and from that perspective, portrayed an accurate interpretation of the play. But the emphasis of a musical is very distinct than the main focus of a play. <br />Overall, both the musical and the play focus on the story of a flower girl that soon becomes the caprice project of two Gentlemen: Mr. Higgins and Colonel Pickering. But it is evident that the interpretation of the director differs from the original version. It is for these reasons, that the movie \\"My Fair Lady\\" would be seen just as acceptable and a little bit inaccurate according to Shaw.  <br />Having said all these, I would like to say that it is a great movie by itself. <br />
B00005JMFQ|4.0|It has as much to do with Christmas as Home Alone, The Bishop'a Wife & other holiday fare.      Here's the deal: You meet somone new during the holidays. It is the perfect 1st date movie. It's about love, but totally non-threatening. If the two of you last, it is a movie to revisit year after year. It's already in dvd to take home (complete with a 9-11 reference to date it forever).      Christmas in London. About a dozen different love stories  somehow intertwined with each other. Stangely, in these times, no overtly gay love stories.      A feel good movie that can be viewed by anyone.  Lots of recognizible stars in a very large, loveable cast. The scenes of modern day London are terrific. Merry Christmas!
0385336810|3.0|Sophie Kinsella no doubt captures the essence (and insecurities) of today's twenty-something single girl.  This book will definately have you laugh out loud and root for Emma Corrigan, the lead character.  You'll definately be able to relate to some of the secrets she reveals in a terrifying situation (\\"It was me who jammed the paper copier last week\\"). The book has a good flow and keeps you interested but just doesnt have the same spark of Kinsella's other books. I felt that the ending was a little too sappy and could have been ended in a much clever way.  I would wait until this book comes out in paperback or check it out of the library.  I'd save a few extra dollars and put it towards purchasing Kinsella's hilarious Shopaholic books.
0743454529|3.0|Yes, I had a love/hate relationship with this book. I loved the premise and got right into the story. But, I did not like that it was multiple first person, and that each person had a different font, that was annoying. I also didn't find the voices terribly different. I also thought there were too many viewpoints here, and I did a LOT of skimming to get to the story, skimmed almost all of Jesse's chapters, as he just wasn't important or interesting and then Julia and Campbell's relationship slowed down Anna's story and didn't add to it. I also did not like that there were so many flashbacks. Did we really need to experience ALL of Kate's hospital moments? As someone else point out too, I think there is a fine line in a smart book like this, where you are presenting issues in a thought provoking manner. The first half of this book was much stronger, and then she fell into too much melodrama, and very 'watch this' type of writing, where you notice the clever observation and profound thoughts of the characters, and it was just too much. But, I could have easily dealt with all of this until her 'twist' ending, which to me was a terrible cop out and cheat, and made me feel like I'd wasted several hours for that kind of a lame payoff.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|My teacher and I watched this movie together because neither one of us could believe that there was anything remotely Buddhist about it. We were dead wrong. Not to beat the point because there are a few discussion strings already on this website about the religious symbolism and spiritual content of the movie, we re thinking of using it for teaching and meditation purposes. Once we have something together we will post the link to the material.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, if you have not seen this movie you should make a point of doing so very soon. It is a historic film.

B00004TRD8|5.0|There are three versions of this movie on this 2-disc DVD:   Theatrical Version   Special Edition   Extended Special Edition (Also known as the Orginial Uncut Version)    The extended special edition is an easter egg, and that is the version with 20 minutes of additional footage, not 16 minutes. It is extremely hard to get to. It contains a new ending and extra footage.     The new footage cut from the theatrical version is described below:    Chapter 10: Ain't no Trouble    This new scene shows two prison guards beating Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) up because she refuses to take her medicine. This scene was cut because it took a long time to shoot and she was getting very mad at one of the prison guards because he kept messing up and it took a total of 20 takes or something. She later got her revenge on him later in the movie.    Chapter 13: There is not much time left in the World    This is another scene that was cut from the theatrical release because this was something that made the film too long. But what is interesting about this new scene is that it has a character from the first movie, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) of whom was never in the theatrical version of Terminator 2. The scene is a dream scene, and it shows the two characters hugging and kissing, then Kyle walks away. Sarah chases him down the hallway, yelling \\"Kyle, don't go!\\" Then she goes through some double doors and ends up at a playground. Then, at the end of the scene, it shows the nuclear blast and then, Sarah wakes up from her dream.     Chapter 20     This is a new scene showing the T-1000 stealing a policeman's car after the explosion of the tow truck chase.    Chapter 24    This is a new scene of the T-1000 killing John Connor's dog, and finding out that The Terminator and John are aware of his whereabouts.    Chapter 37    New dialogue is added to this scene.    Chapter 38    This new scene is where the Terminator, John and Sarah open up and take out the Terminator's chip, therefore shutting him down. Then, Sarah knows she can't destroy the actual Terminator, but, she can destroy this little, fragile chip that is like the on/off switch for the Terminator. John stops her from trying to destroy the chip with a hammer. He convices her not to do it, and she finally listens to him. SO, she doesn't destroy the chip, and they put it back in the Terminator's skull. This scene was cut because this took about three months to film this one scene.     Chapter 39    This new scene is a scene when John teaches the Terminator how to smile. This scene is hilarious, because when thew Terminator tries to smile, it looks like he is smiling like a horse. This scene also has a new character for the movie, and the person is the woman John Connor (Edward Furlong) says \\"nice place you got here\\" and the new character, being the cashier (played by Nancy Fish) says, \\"gimme a break\\".     Chapter 41    This new scene introduces Miles Dyson (Joe Morton)'s family. It is a scene where it introduces another character to the movie,  and that is Dyson's daughter, who was never seen in the thatrical version. This scene was cut because when Sarah tries to kill Dyson, and Dyson's son was available for shooting the film, but his daughter wasn't.    Chapter 43     This is an extended scene where additional dialogue between Sarah and her friend Enrique. And, the other part of the extended scene is John talking about how he lives, and it also show him handling large assault weapons. This scene was cut because Cameron did not want to show a kid handling large scale weapons.     Chapter 49    This extended scene has additonal dialogue of the Terminator and John talking to each other while the Terminator drives to the Dyson house.    Chapter 50     This extended scene shows Sarah stalking Dyson.    Chapter 55    This new scene shows Dyson, Sarah and the Terminator destroying all of Dyson's equipment.     Chapter 67    This is an extended scene showing the T-1000 malfunctioning.    Chapter 75This is an extended scene of which there are two Sarahs, yet one of them is the real Sarah. This extended scene shows which one is the real Sarah and the fake Sarah. What it shows is that the fake Sarah (the T-1000)'s feet are also malfunctioning, so that is how John could tell beteween the two.    SCENES ONLY IN EXTENDED SPECIAL EDITION     These two scenes are very hard to see, so here is a description.     Chapter 24    This is the uncut sequence of the T-1000 at John's foster parents' home. The added footage shows the T-1000 searching John's room.    Chapter 79    This is the orginial ending  for Terminator 2. It is set in the year 2029 and it shows a much older Sarah, now being 64; and a much older John, playing with his daugher at a playground. It also shows Sarah speaking into a voice recorder.
1400076943|5.0|I know I'm being unfair when I say it should have made the short list since I have not had the opportunity to read many that did so -- they are not available in the US.  I chose this book since it had made the long list and was one of the few available here from that list.  As revealed in other reviews, this is a classic story of abuse and denial, told time and time again, but has the ring of actuality about it.  The fact that the background is Nigeria and not a more familiar locale makes it even more compelling.  The revelation that this kind of abuse is prevalent in that corner of the world makes it all the more horrifying, plus the fact that part of the father's abuse is to deny his children access to his traditionalist father and heritage.  As another reviewer has remarked, I look forward to a sequel because these characters are so vivid, I want to know what happened to them once the book was finished.
B00008438V|2.0|Simply put, this is a juvenile boy's fantasy run amok, trying to pass itself off as comedy with some insight into the teenage \\"experience,\\" whatever the hell that is.  I saw this years ago, and found it to be stupid & inane beyond words.  I saw it again on TV this weekend, and found that time has in no way improved it.<br /><br />All of the John Hughes hallmarks are here --- teen angst galore, loads of pithy, self-aware dialogue that no real-life teenager would ever utter, broadly stereotyped adults that are nothing more than cardboard cutouts.  Additionally, of course (giving us a hint of what was to come with the \\"Home Alone\\" movies & \\"Baby's Day Out\\"), there runs throughout the film crass & vulgar slapstick masquerading as humor.  It is embarrassing to thing that a movie as crude and unfunny as this even managed to be made in the first place.<br /><br />I do admit that I found Bill Paxton (as Chet) to be funny throughout the movie, and Anthony Michael Hall has a certain dorky charm to him that makes him almost impossible to like.  However, it just isn't enough for me to get past the sheer stupidity of the movie.  The scary thing is, this is far from the worst of John Hughes' efforts, and that is indeed saying something.  Maybe that is why I didn't give it one star.
B00001ZT6Z|4.0|This is an excellent Metal album, while listening it reminds me of Metal Church/Queensryche more than Sabbath, but is great nonetheless. <br />Brian May, legendary Queen Guitarist is quite welcome on \\"When Death Calls\\", Brian is a close pal with Tony Iommi, the King of the Riff, these two working together musta been awesome to see. <br />And Tony Martin on vocals after Dio left was great too, But I wonder when Cyd Charisse let him out of the house. <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I watch this every single year as the holiday approaches and it never gets \\"old\\".  It makes me laugh each time I watch it!  Chevy Chase at his best!  The lingerie counter scene - Hilarious!  The squirrel in the Christmas tree - Classic! I could go on and on! I give it a huge 2 thumbs up!  Every cast member delivers an A+!  Great!  Great!  Great!  For those sensitive to language, there is some bad language in various spots of the movie but all in all it's one of my favorites!
0743454529|4.0|I'm a mystery lover through and through and figured this book would not hold my interest - I was wrong... <br /> <br />I listened to the audio version of this book and loved it. Given that each chapter is a different character, the audio version uses different voices/narrators for each character, making for an easy distinction in voice. (I actually came to dread Sara's voice. She made me so angry!) I thought this was a wonderful book simply because it made me \\"feel\\". How did I feel? In the 13 hours it took to listen to it in my car - I was put through every emotion possible - and that folks, makes for a great story. I definitely recommend it. <br /> <br />After skimming through your reviews - so many of you hated the ended and felt it was a \\"cop-out\\". But remember, this story is about Anna. It was always about Anna (even Sara could never seem to grasp that). And guess what - bad things happen everyday to wonderful families. Not all stories can have that perfect happy ending we all yearn for...
B0006284JQ|5.0|I know people are complaining that Britney hasn't been out long enough to have a true greatest hits album and I agree.  A better title would be \\"Singles,\\" or \\"The Best Of Britney Spears,\\" but who cares?  The album rocks!  As a fan since the beginning, I have to admit that the latest album Britney released (\\"In The Zone\\") was her best to date.  Her earlier albums were too bubblegum and filled with fillers, her later albums not so.  The track listing could be improved because it takes away from the value of the music but you get used to it.  Also, as mentioned in other reviews, not all of Britney's hits are on here, like \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,\\" \\"Born To Make You Happy,\\" \\"I Love Rock n' Roll,\\" and \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart.\\"  \\"Greatest Hits\\" proves that Britney is talented and has staying power.  Even if she's taking a break now, you can be sure that she'll be back.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I have loved SP ever since I first saw them live, back when they were virtually unknown to the world. This CD is definitely the best one, with the greatest combination of songs. There are still some fun songs, but the songs on Still Not Getting Any reflect a growth and maturity of the band. The songs are powerful and awesome- with great parts and lyrics.
0140277447|5.0|Thirty years ago when I attended Ji Zhao Ying Elementary school in Nanjing, many the holocaust witnesses were still alive and lived in my neighborhood. They told stories in summer evenings. Often mentioned were their close relatives killed by Japanese in the bloody days. It seemed every senior neighbor could name victims in their family trees. Iris Chang, however, from a higher level, depicted a big picture of the holocaust, and described truthfully the history in a logic way. The contents are faithful and the author is loyal to the history, according to my knowledges that directly come from those witnesses. <br />- A reader from Nanjing
B00008ADPF|1.0|Actually, there are no words to describe how bad it is.<br />Anyone claiming this piece of trash \\"rocks\\" just doesn't know any better.Don't embarass yourself cos' in a few years you'll be ashamed to admit you actually PAID for it.<br />There are thousands of great bands starving, making great, great music, waiting to be discovered and you make this crappy bunch rich?? What's wrong with you,people...
B0002S947K|5.0|This album has not only touched me, but inspired me in so many ways.  The title track, \\"Trouble\\" is the most amazing song I have heard in a long time.  Then you hear \\"Shelter\\" and you want to cry.  This is a song where the vocals lead the music, not the other way around.  His lyrics and rhythms are amazing.  Ray Lamontagne is an incredible artist and is going to lead new music in a wonderful direction.
0783225792|5.0|Not much to say besides Love it, Love it, Love it.  Pacino and DeNiro make a great team.  Love everything about this movie.  A must see for movie lovers!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD kicks A**. It's a little morbid But still it made me cry. It's one h**l of a headbangin' CD.
B00001QEE9|5.0|A well-done movie from Disney. A great kids movie, and the adults will find much to love here too. Jiminy Cricket really steals the show- just watch the scene where he comes into the pool hall where Pinocchio is smoking cigars and starts Jiminy yelling at him. I thought the scene was very funny. A good movie for the kids, slightly more mature than other Disney flicks, but something that the children will like. <br /> <br />However, I don't understand why parents say they don't like showing this to infants and toddlers. Fact is, a two year old child will not understand what is going on very well, if at all. The transformation scene, the smoking, destruction, and the gun under Geppetto's pillow goes right over any young child's head. If a child tells you that the movie scares them, you simply put the DVD in a closet and leave it there- period. The movie was made about 2/3 of a century ago, when people didn't make such a big stink over EVERYTHING that happens in a children's movie. And please use your head- if you are thoroughly convinced that Pinocchio will scare your toddler out of his socks, then purchase him a copy of \\"Hoop De Doo! It's A Wiggly Party\\" or \\"The Care Bears Movie\\". Be warned, though- your child may not like these sugary sweet, super censored programs any more than you do.
B00005JLFC|4.0|A real classic movie.  Why is it not available on DVD??? <br /> <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. The actors were splendid. And to think that one man could love a women so much to do the things he does for her every day just gives us a sense of hope.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Lots of people refer to this as the funniest movie of all time which is a pretty strong thing to say but I can't honestly think of one that's made me laugh as much as The Holy Grail even 30 yrs. later. The only person I've known who didn't think this movie was funny was my dad who was an occupational guidance councellor at the time. I still remember him shaking his head in dismay as he left a room of hysterical laughter behind him (not really that uncommon).  <br /> <br />The Grail is definitely the funniest thing the Pythons as a group ever did and that's saying something. I guess it probably is the funniest movie ever made!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Funeral is this year's You Forget It In People for me. It's an album that's bound to have its share of detractors since it's gotten hyped to the point where it's easy for someone to become turned off from the start. And Funeral really didn't sink in until I gave it a few listens. It's a gorgeous record, a complete explosion of some of the most densely constructed beautiful sounds to hit indie rock in a long time. To write them off as another \\"orchestral pop band\\" milking The Soft Bulletin, you're missing the point. The Arcade Fire present a completely frenzy of emotionally wrought songs that get tear ducts working. The first song \\"Tunnels\\" is a fabulous opener, one that slowly builds to a point of absolute release. \\"Power Out,\\" \\"Laika,\\" \\"Crown Of Love,\\" and \\"Rebellion\\" are all gems, and the final tune \\"In The Backseat\\" will have you sobbing if you're not already. Believe the hype this time, and pick this one up. Definitely the best of 2004.
B00000260F|2.0|This record is a complete disaster. Jeff Beck must look back at this album and remark \\"what was I thinking\\". First of all there isn't enough Jeff Beck to hear on the record. It sounds like a bunch of mediocre songs with terrible no-name singers trying to pull it offf and Jeff Beck throwing in an occassional solo. What's even worse is these solos are nothing to write home about either when you compare it to guitar work on \\"There and Back\\" or \\"Blow by Blow\\". The only saving grace when it comes to vocals on this record is Rod Stewart singing \\"People Get Ready\\". He should have just paid him to sing on the rest of the record and maybe it wouldn't have been that bad. But I must say hidden on this record is probably one of the most moving and haunting instrumentals Jeff Beck ever composed \\"You Know We Know\\". The guitar work on this song is Jeff Beck in top form. Besides these two tracks, and the decent \\"Escape\\" with Jan Hammer, the rest of the record is overproduced and oversynthesized trash.
B00005JMAH|2.0|With the richness of the story available to him, the director did one of the worst jobs I have ever been subjected to. I am almost glad it was too short. Anything longer would have been pure torture. I took a friend whom I had been telling about Harry for ages, and was actually embarrassed for Ms. Rowling's work. My friend was totally lost, as would anyone be who hadn't read the book before attending. Was this director on drugs, or was he simply trying to design the worst possible film he could get away with - just to see if he could? Does he believe that anyone who reads Harry is totally incapable of comprehension? Or was he simply insulting his audience?<br /><br />For myself, I was truly disappointed that such a wonderful storyline was butchered into a disorganized, ill designed mess. I went back home and re-read the story, just to make sure that it was the movie that was such a disaster, and not my own memory! Thank goodness it was the director and not myself. Imagine my shock when Ms. Rowling actually praised this destruction of her work - is it written into her publisher's contract that she accept whatever the director designs, no matter what a terrible job he does? What a disappointment.<br /><br />If this is what was done to my favorite Harry Potter to date, I certainly hope that the next director is less of an incompetent than this one was, or I will totally give up on the whole series and stick with the audio versions of the books. At least I won't feel as if I am being purposely insulted!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Me and my sister went out early the morning of November 9,just to buy this CD.  It was well worth the wait!  Every song on this CD makes you want to get up and dance!  I would advise anyone to buy it.  It was a great addition to all my other Shania CD's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|HAving grown up wathching Kennedy and Johnson and McNamara on our black and white tv, it was hauting to listen to McNamara talk about it. He raises some issues that neither Republicans nor Democrats can answer... <br /> <br />I do need to very a few statements from the movie. For example, is it really true thet McNamara got Ford to introduce seat belts and padded dashboards without governement legislation. If so, score one for capitalism! <br /> <br />Also, I was taught that Kennedy was getting ready to send large numbers of troops into Viet Nam before he was assassinated. McNamara contradicted that.
0201633612|5.0|I first read this book six years ago. It was the right time at my carrer. I had just finished a C++ project that hadn't gone so well.<br /><br />With all the failures of the project still fresh in my mind, it was easy to appreaciate how useful the book was. We could have used many of the concepts in the book in that project.<br /><br />And here is the catch of this type of book: it is not appreciated until you go through a project wihtout it. Giving it to a college student as reading assignment will be a waste of time. It is more useful to the professional with some experience under the belt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it remains little read by professional programmers. It deserves a lot more attention and careful study.
B00063MBU8|4.0|When the single \\"Welcome to my Life\\" came out I was blown away. It was a great song that me along with hundreds of other teens could relate to. So of course there was one question on my mind, would the new album me a CD full of incredible, well written songs like their first single or a big let down. The answer? Alot of new amazing tracks just as good, if not better than the first single. It's music that I can relate to, and who can resist the soul-full voice of Pierre's. Even if you weren't a Simple Plan fan in the past, I urge you to pick up a copy of the new album... you won't be dissapointed.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool to me is not just a band. I can't say exactly what I mean by that, but must regrettably quote Fred Durst in that they're above talented. Before this CD, I was listening to bands like COLD and Trust Company. I have every Tool cd (except Salival which nobody has) and believe they have progressed to an almost spiritual nature with their last cd Lateralus. If you've never heard this cd, stop what you're doing and go buy it. It costs $20 bucks and you won't regret it. <br /> <br />This cd starts off with Stinkfist (if you didn't know, when MTV played the music video, they named it track 1) which is great. The sound doesn't just go through your ears but searches for your soul, until you feel the sound throughout your body. Some might be put off by that but any Tool fan would agree whole-heartily. <br /> <br />I hope that Tool will start up again soon and look forward to the day I can see them in concert.
0060254920|4.0|A nice, imaginative story about a kid named Max and his imaginary monsters. <br />This book is very fun to read out loud at bedtime. <br /> <br />Depending on your taste, you might consider the illustrations to be a *bit* outdated. Even though the illustrations are beautiful and full of detail, the colors are a bit too dull for my taste (and my kids).
B00005R2M3|5.0|shakira is one of my favourite singers to date. she is just different.  her voice is exotic and cannot be dupicated.  she has a beautiful body and can work it well.   <br /> <br />the 3 best tracks on the LP are 'objection (tango)', 'underneath your clothes', and 'poem to a horse'.  'objection' is just brilliant.  i love the way the song begins with the acordian and breaks into this latin opera. it is awesome.  'underneath your clothes' is excellent. i did not like this song until she sang it live on DIVAS LIVE 2002.  \\"poem to a horse' made me think and if a song makes me think like that...its the bomb. <br /> <br />'fool', 'the one', 'whenever, wherever', and 'eyes like yours' (the english version of her spanish hit 'ojos asi') are just classics. <br /> <br />the whole album was wreckshop and i recommend this album to everyone. even the hard core gangstas. JP. but this album is hot. <br /> <br />5+++ stars
B00005JMUL|1.0|Call me immature but Im not. When I was young, I was totally freaked out with santa, I cried and cried everytime I sat on his lap. But the thihng is, writing a review on this not so good movie has ntohing got to do with my bad experiences... <br /> <br />The polar express is When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe. <br /> <br />what makes this movie so great is (eerr) the CGI. The background and the special effects are dazzalling amd sometimes exciting. But the thing is, Though the movie is visually stunning overall, but the animation for the human characters isn't lifelike enough, and the story is quite...... odd. <br /> <br />There was no heart to this story... no soul to makes us feel warm in our bodies.... but It really exposed the coldness of the movie and litterally coldness of the north pole... <br />I found this movie quite scary. Santa is scary... the north pole is scary. Wouldn't they have frozen to death? <br /> <br />I don't know... theres something not right about this movie.. ignoring the fact santa clause is evil and BIG AND SCARY RED DEVIL!... BUT!!!!!!!! <br />Its not the right kind of movie that would score an A+, nor A nor B+ nor B nor C+ nor C nor D+ not D Nor E+ but a nice \\"E\\". <br /> <br />The reason for such a low score is because this movie does not live up to its trailer.. and it tries to hard to become a nice holiday movie...  <br /> <br />heres a funny quote from a reviewer and I agree: <br />\\"Now it can be said, Santa Claus is a fascist dictator who likes to kidnap and endanger children so that they can learn the true value of Christmas.\\" <br />-- Michelle Alexandria, ECLIPSE MAGAZINE <br /> <br /> <br />p.s: not only santa is scary, the whole animated characters are dead freaky.. like zombies back to life in pastic form!

B00008S2VG|3.0|i dont get madonna at all.... she changed from boy toy, material girl, sex siren, controversial star, mother, sophisticated lady, novelist..... then HARD CORE POLITICIAN!!!!! <br /> <br />i dont like this madonna at all... she is tryin to reach a point and tell me something but im as confused as ever... <br /> <br />the title track 'american life' is just a millenium version of \\"we built this city\\". this song is alright but then she starts rapping... which sounds okay until she mentions PILATES!!!!! first rule of rappers.... DON\\"T RAP ABOUT PILATES! PERIOD!  the LP goes on into 'hollywood' which i still dont know what she is talkin about but the song is still alright. <br /> <br />okay i could get into the album but this album was not all that great... the best songs are 'easy ride', 'die another day', and 'i'm so stupid' (arguebaly the best song on the album because she is so mad in this song). <br /> <br />overall, i'd rather her madonna rap about having sex with warren betty then about her luxary life...  <br /> <br />2.8 stars <br />
0553573403|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved Lord of the Rings, but when it comes to plots, subplots, and intrigue, this series takes the cake.<br /><br />It is a story of several kingdoms struggling for control over a land.  It has everything one could ever want in a novel:  love, backstabbing, incest, bloodshed, loyalty, action.  The story is told through the eyes of various characters so one gets to see the events through different viewpoints.  The characters are all very human, they all have virtues, vices, and self-interest, just like real people.  Unlike most novels, its plot is not a clear-cut battle between good and evil, it is more of a study of human nature set against the backdrop of a medieval/fantasy world.  Here people do not live just because they are good, and do not die just because their usefulness towards the plot has run out.  Sometimes they die when you do not want them to -- in their prime.  Although this can be upsetting, it reflects how life works sometimes.  The best part is that the author makes sure you know all of the characters inside and out so you actually feel for them when things happen to them.<br /><br />Each book in this series is either just under or over 1000 pages long.  A daunting task?  Hardly.  Once you start them you simply cannot put them down.  George R. R. Martin is the master of the cliffhanger.  Make sure all your personal affairs are all tucked in before you start reading this series, as you will probably start to neglect your career and home once you start reading this series -- they are page turners.  Always have the next book in the series on hand or you will be tortured as you wait for it to arrive in the mail.  I already pre-ordered the 4th book in the series, which is set to come out in December 2004.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00006879E|4.0|This CD came out in the summer of 2002 and it has taken 2 years for it to break to a larger audience. After hitting the road, they have polished their act, their on stage presence and their playing and singing skills. Singer Adam Levin reminds you of singer Colin Bloostone from The Zombies (British Invasion) and the soulful feeling of Simply Red. I am quite sure that if they hold together and continue to write within this soulful and skillful vain into their next album, they do have the talent to become a big international act. Nope, they are not a \\"one hit wonder\\". Listen and listen carefully. There's a lot of talent here. Kudos! And on to the next for 2005.
B0006284JQ|3.0|I think Britney Spears has been the biggest, most influential pop artist of the last decade.  She totally changed the pop music scene around the world, and can already be compared to lifetime divas like Madonna.  It was about time she released her first greatest hits compilation, but \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative\\" is definitely  not the best she could have done.  She only has 4 albums out, and for that reason, I expected ALL of her singles to be included here.  \\"Born To Make You Happy\\", \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\", \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" should have been included by default.  On the other hand, I don't know why \\"Outrageous\\" was put in here...the video was never even released, and the song never became a single.  Finally, why release a cover song as the lead single for a greatest hits album, and worse of all, title the CD that way?  \\"My prerogative\\" is Bobby Brown's greatest hit, not Britney's.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|an intensely spirited and comprehensive tour de force (through funk, punk and everything in between) that will surely satisfy those listeners who can handle a band that has truly evolved. Those of you perpetually stuck in the early days need to move on. The last few offerings from this band are stronger, more mature examples of genius - so of course they're going to play a lot of that stuff (and alienate the nostalgia junkies).<br /><br />I, too, was there watching when their first video hit MTV. They've gone from novelty to masterpiece of DNA through no small miracle. Enjoy a great band having an amazing and well-deserved time.
B0006IIKS0|2.0|This overlong, over bearing and over weaning documentary shows two kinds of Metallica sessions. There are the musical sessions that become the \\"St. Anger\\" album, and the therapy sessions that show the three core members of Metallica as a dysfunctional bunch of puffed up jerks. (Well, maybe not so much Kirk Hammet, who spends most of the movie being quiet.) The problem is, at two hours and twenty minutes, the war between Lars and James gets old, and fast! Had \\"Some Kind Of Monster\\" delved into more of the creative processes instead of dragging on and on with the endless analysis, this may have been an interesting 90 minute VH1 special. But Noooooo! Apparently those with creative control over this monster decided that every little nosepicking argument had to be preserved for posterity.<br /><br />There are the occasional interesting moments. These include Lars' Dad telling him that the songs \\"don't cut it.\\" The band plotting to ditch their therapist Dr Phil, and then the therapist guilt tripping the band to keep him on. Lars' comment that the original bassist Cliff Burton might not have made the cut for auditions. You can even almost feel for James as he slams the door on the band, then books himself into rehab. Ditto for Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, shown confronting Lars about getting dumped by and living in the shadow of Metallica. (Is the Megadeth therapy DVD coming next?)<br /><br />But frankly, this isn't anywhere near as interesting as it could have been. Both The Ramones' \\"End Of The Century\\" and Wilco's \\"I am Trying To Break Your Heart\\" are scads more interesting than the whiny blob that Frankensteined into \\"Some Kind Of Monster.\\"
B000031XCR|5.0|This album can convinced you how professional Celine Dion sings.  Though I don't conside this as greatest hits like what other people assumes, this album is worth to be bought and be part of your Celine Collections....
B000000OA6|5.0|I just finished listening to Innuendo today. I only knew a few songs from it (the ones that were on Classic Queen), so I didn't know what to expect. I liked the songs that were on Classic Queen, but I wasn't sure about the rest. <br /> <br />Innuendo far surpassed my expectations. While I didn't care for Bijou or Delilah, the rest of album was fantastic. Great album to wrap up Queen's long reign.

B00000G3Q4|5.0|Even though it's been more than 20 years since its original release, 1982's THE EVIL DEAD is still an impressive marvel of low-budget filmmaking.  It does have its palpable flaws, but this first feature-length directorial effort from SPIDERMAN's (2002) Sam Raimi, produced on a shoestring budget of circa $350,000, offers clever special FX, interesting make-up work, relentless shocks, and brilliant direction and camera work.  And of considerable note to genre fans, it highlights Raimi's knack for pushing violence and gore to such an extreme that it becomes comic or farcical, a characteristic that is enhanced by the slapstick talents of actor Bruce Campbell (who would himself become a cult hero due to his work in this and other Raimi films).<br /><br />The story involves a group of college students who, during a weekend getaway, find a Sumerian Book of the Dead in an old wilderness cabin they've rented.  When they unwittingly unleash evil spirits and demons while reading incantations from the book, that's when the real havoc--and the real fun for the audience--begins.  As each of the kids, one by one, are possessed by the demons they've loosed, body parts and bodily fluids go a-flying until only one young man is left to face down the Evil Dead.  A simple plot with a simple set up, but Raimi and Campbell effectively milk it for all the scares and all the laughs they can get.<br /><br />There are several editions of THE EVIL DEAD available on DVD, most of which come from the wonderful folks at Anchor Bay.  Most are of great quality and offer beautifully restored digital transfers of this cult classic.  The best discs also include feature commentaries from Raimi and Campbell.
B000267JQK|4.0|I First Heard Seether With Their First Single Fine Again.  I Got Their First And Only CD Disclaimer For My Birthday.  I Loved Pretty Much Every Song On The CD But The Only Complaint I Have About It Is That It's Too Short With Only 12 Songs.  Everything Changed For Me When They Re-Released Disclaimer As Disclaimer II And Added Four New Songs And Four Songs Taken From Soundtracks They Have Been On.  It's Too Bad Instead Of Making A New Album They Just Added Songs To Their Old CD But It's Still A Great CD.  Some Songs That Stood Out To Me Were; Gasoline, Fine Again, Driven Under, F#ck It (The Version On This CD Is Different From The One On Disclaimer), Broken, Sold Me (From The Punisher), Take Me Away, Out Of My Way (From Freddy Vs Jason), Hang On (From Daredevil), Broken Feat Amy Lee (From The Punisher).  This CD Should Have Something For Everyone; Hard Songs, Slow Songs, Acoustic Songs.
B00023BLXK|4.0|This movie is great! It has good dancing and really enjoyable music. Those who thought that the original \\"Dirty Dancing\\" was good will enjoy this even more (I personally do not think much of the original) as the dancing is better - it's more sensual and fluid - and there is great chemistry between the two lead characters in this movie that was absolutely lacking in the original version!  <br /> <br />The backdrop of this movie (the period just before the Cuban revolution) does not impact much upon the storyline other than being a convenient way for the show to end (and rather abruptly at that), but forget about it! What is there is enough for warrant it more than just one viewing. A definite must-watch for people who like dancing, good music and a little romance!
B00006V9A0|1.0|I admit, the songs are decent, but the remixing of the songs suck.<br /><br />Smells Like Teen Spirit has too much bass, for example.<br /><br />Anyway, you should buy the albums rather than compilations.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay, as I said in my review for her Greatest Hits album, I hate Britney Spears as a person. She's a slutty little airhead. But I don't care. I think her music is catchy and fun to dance to. Most of the tracks here are more club-friendly than radio-friendly, but I think this is, by far, her best album to date-and so, of course, it contains her best song of all time, \\"Toxic.\\" Unlike her previous three, which had a few strong singles and then a mound of atrocious ballads and other aggravating filler, this record is short and sweet and really doesn't have much filler.  <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC- Great club track. It gets better when you listen to it more, but when you listen to it too much it gets old. Not my favorite, but good. (4/5)  <br /> <br />(I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM- This one is way too long-over five minutes-it's like a remix. However. It is a pretty good club track-its fun and because it features the Ying Yang Twins, as another reviewer posted, it does indeed have a 'meshed Indian-dirty ghetto' feel. (3/5)  <br /> <br />SHOWDOWN- One of the worst tracks here. It's kind of annoying. (2/5)  <br /> <br />BREATHE ON ME- This one's pretty cool. But you have to be in the right mood to listen to it. Reminds me of Madonna's \\"Erotica.\\" (4/5)  <br /> <br />EARLY MORNIN'- I kind of want to like this one but I'm really not that thrilled with it. Cool club jam, once again. (3/5)  <br /> <br />TOXIC- Awesome, awesome, awesome. Read my other reviews on it (Now 15, Britney's Greatest Hits) for details. (5/5)  <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS- Another cool club track that just isn't that fantastic. But good. I love the breakdown in the middle. (4/5)  <br /> <br />TOUCH OF MY HAND- Don't ask me why, but I like this song. Very cool, Asian-influenced beat in the beginning. (5/5)  <br /> <br />THE HOOK UP- Along with \\"Showdown,\\" the only true filler here. I don't really like it. Britney can not and should not rap. It made me laugh. (1/5)  <br /> <br />SHADOW- This is a really good song. I'm surprised it didn't become a hit. Along with \\"Everytime,\\" it is one of the only two ballads by Britney that I enjoy. (5/5)  <br /> <br />BRAVE NEW GIRL- The closest to Britney's traditional bubblegum pop this album comes to. It is also one of my favorite songs here. Why this didn't become a hit I have no idea. It has a very sweet, happy feel. The beat is very catchy. (5/5)  <br /> <br />EVERYTIME- As I said before, one of the only two Britney ballads that I actually enjoy. I really liked it when it first came out, but I like it a little less now. What she did in the video was stupid. It's still a good song, though. (5/5)  <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC REMIX- In some ways, this is better than the original version. Great beat. (4/5)  <br /> <br />OVERALL SCORE: 50/65      <br /> <br />All in all, this is definitely Britney's best album to date, but it is also the least appropriate album for the kiddies, so you might wanna be aware of that. For those who are annoyed by bubblegum pop, this is for you. If you're only going to get one Britney album, I would actually recommend her Greatest Hits CD, but there are some songs here I like way more than a couple of the songs on there.
6304698798|5.0|I'm not a \\"western\\" type of guy, but Sergio Leone's Man with no Name trilogy reeled me in to three of the greatest westerns ever made, starring none other than Clint himself.<br /><br />Nothing compares to this movie in terms of style. Every character has its own charm-be it Clint's reluctant style, or ugly's cunning nature and the cruel \\"bad\\" guy (determine for yourself who is good, bad or ugly). The music has become kind of an anthem for the \\"wild wild west\\" movies and has been copied the world over. I have seen the movie half a dozen times, still I cannot resist playing the DVD whenever I get time. Would highly recommend it to everyone.
B00068IOWM|3.0|After reading all reviews here, by far the best and most helpful is that very long one, in which I found an overall and then track by track review. Most of the other ones just express a really dislike for this album, or love and hands down for the same. I think a good review MUST explain and gives full details about the item reviewed, not just \\"I hate, is crap\\" neither \\"I love it, it Rocks, is awesome\\". Both kind of reviews don't say me anything about the album itself. So I'm gonna give more details about this album, and then my own opinion. <br />One weird thing is there's no fade in nor fade out on this album, every song starts and ends like a live concert. There're many guitars on this album, both acoustic sometimes ( tracks 6 and 7 ) and electric ones ( all the rest, including tracks 6 and 7 ). Among electric guitars I found some hard ones ( tracks 1, 4 and 6 ) and many \\"classic Edge ones\\" on several tracks, like 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 11. Track 5 remains me some I will follow guitar, track 3 is very ATYCLB guitars, as well tracks 2, 8 ( a bit harder anyway ) and 10. Track 11 is more an Acthung Baby one, talking about instruments, with that Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses druming, but Bono is very average on this album, sadly. The guitars and keyboards is the main sound of the album. You'll find several strings and keyboards specially on tracks 3, 9 and 10 ( on this one, there's some Oasis strings appeared on Wathever, for example ). <br />Most of the songs are short, and the album is just 49 minutes long, being the shorter album since Unforgettable Fire in 1984.  <br />Unlike cover art, this album has nothing from Punk Music, rather is very a quiet and slow one. The hardest songs of this album are tracks 1, 4 and 6. The mid tempo ones are tracks 2, 5, 8 and 11. Ballads and slow tracks are 3, 7, 9 and 10. So just 1/3 of the album is \\"Rock\\". The most similar album is All That You Can't Live Behind. For me, the \\"A\\" side is better than the \\"B\\" side. The strongest numbers are Vertigo, Miracle Drug, Love And Peace Or Else, City Of Blinding Lights, All Because Of You, Crumbs For Your Table and Yawheh. The weakest songs are Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, A Man And A Woman, One Step Closer and Original Of The Species. The most different song, Miami from Pop, Numb for Zooropa, The Refugee from War, is Love And Peace Or Else, but this track is not so great, really. Again, Bono sings pretty weak and rough sometimes. <br />Yahweh stars awesome, and for the first time I actually I listen the 90's U2 here, except when Bono sings the word \\"Yahweh\\".  <br />A Man And A Woman seems to be the new Party Girl, specially for the intro. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own goes nowhere, making togheter with One Step Closer, boring 9 minutes of the album. I can notice City Of Blinding Lights probably will be next single, is such a strong song, well constructed and performed and it's my favourite from the whole album. All Because Of You is pretty a Rattle & Hum song.  <br />Of dissapointing way, some songs seems to be built with more than 200 takes, even The Edge admit Vertigo needed 300 takes. That makes the album <br />lack of freshness and energy. Also you can notice all overdubs weren't played at real time. A lot of post production for this album. <br />Sincerely I don't like that form to make songs, as if they were puzzles you need to put one piece and then after 2 weeks, <br />other one. Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band and The Dark Side Of The Moon were written like that, but here, sadly, I'm not listening such a whole and amazing new music world.  <br />This new album is a good listening, it surpasses the mediocrity and simplicity of All That You Can.t Live Behind, there's no Wild Honey nor Grace nor Peace On Earth here, but this album isn't essential neither won't change the music world, unlike what Acthung Baby, Zooropa and Pop did. Some songs are better than others here, as well some other U2 albums are better than thisone. Peace

B00024I2Z4|5.0|For me, watching \\"Mulan\\" on Special Edition DVD was the first time viewing the movie. It's a great presentation and it really holds up well. The music is in the strong Disney tradition, with vocal pieces developed by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel and the awesome soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith. The story is well written, with characters the viewer can really feel for, particularly the main character Mulan. Finally, the film is a visual masterpiece that really draws the eye to its beauty and helps to tell the story. Possibly the film's only weak point is its villain --- Shan-Yu doesn't really have the same effect as some of the more well-developed Disney villains such as Jafar from \\"Aladdin\\" or Hades from \\"Hercules.\\"<br /><br />I'm not any big, renowned film critic, so if I haven't sold you on the movie, perhaps I can at least give you a good run-down of the special features. Although the special features for the \\"Mulan\\" Special Edition DVD are not quite as numerous as those for the recent \\"Aladdin\\" release, they're just as good. The first disc contains songs / music videos and deleted scenes, as well as a tour of Mulan's World. The songs in this movie are very strong and the music videos are no exception. Some are better than others, but I definitely enjoyed them all. Jackie Chan's performance of \\"Be a Man\\" in Chinese was a great one to include. There are several deleted scenes, complete with commentary, as well as a deleted song that's fairly cool, but it's obvious wouldn't have worked with the movie. The Mulan's World feature has Mushu (Mark Moseley I would assume, since Eddie Murphy hasn't done the voice since the original feature) explaining various aspects of China. Since it's Mushu, there are plenty of jokes, of course, but I feel this actually really was quite well done as far as learning goes. Finally, the first disc includes a commentary track that gives a lot of insight into the making of the film, what things did and didn't work, and what some of the major people involved with the film liked. The second disc contains one more bonus song, \\"Reflection\\" in Spanish and a behind-the-scenes tour of the movie. Unlike the \\"Aladdin\\" behind-the-scenes featurette, this one has a bit more open feel. Each of the aspects from graphic design to music are in separate sections and you can select them to view at your leisure. You'll learn everything from how the movie was developed visually to the process of being it to other countries.<br /><br />This is definitely the complete package of what one would expect from a two-disc DVD set. If, like me, you haven't seen \\"Mulan\\" before this, you should definitely take a look, or if you're already a fan of the movie, this is a great DVD set to get.of the major people involved with the film liked.

B0000025RI|4.0|Seven of the nine songs on this album were released.  It has sold over 40 million copies worldwide.  Only \\"Thriller\\"!  Michael Jackson delivers a very strong album with \\"Thriller\\".  You could have popped this album in 1982 (the year of its release), or in 2004 and it would still have the same effect.  This album is timeless.  There is quality music on this CD.  Fillers are out of the question.  Everything's a keeper.     \\"Billie Jean\\" is one of Michael's biggest singles to date.  The song is about (as if you didn't already know) a groupie accusing Michael of being the father of her child.  The beat to this song is great and no one had ever covered that topic in their song before so Michael did a bit of innovation for this one.  The album's title track is all about being scared.  From the instruments in the background to the video to the lyrics, Michael's only intent is to make you scared.  \\"PYT\\" is another album highlight; Janet sings in the background as an added bonus. \\"Lady in My Life is a lovely song.  It's a ballad and Michael shows his fans that he can be sensual, and he can even croon his female fans, too.  \\"Wanna Be Startin Something is about people trying to start mess among other people.  This song was the first single form \\"Thriller\\" and was a huge success.     What I like about this album is that Michael covers so much in just nine songs.  He goes from groupies to avoiding fights to instigators to the lady in his life.  Michael really broke the mold the release of this album. Why?  CAUSE THIS IS THRILLER!    Mikeisha's Top 5  1. PYT  2. Lady in My Life  3. Human Nature  4. Wanna Be Startin Something  5. The Girl is Mine
B00005JMXX|2.0|\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is one of those movies that can be rated as worth seeing, as long as nothing else of importance is going on.  This movie takes a big-budget, special-effects-filled look at what the world would look like if the greenhouse effect and global warming continued at such levels that they resulted in worldwide catastrophe and disaster, including multiple hurricanes, tornadoes, tidal waves, floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age. The acting was sub-par, at best.
0156027321|3.0|Well the first part of this book was extremely horrible and hard to muddle through !  However the second part of the book (the actually adventure) I really enjoyed   I would not recommend the first part to anyone .
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This is an amazing album that I haven't stopped listening to since I picked it up 6 years ago. Almost all of the songs are great, my favorites include Down to the Waterline, Sultans of Swing (duh), and Lions.  <br />Anyone who likes rock music from the 80s should definately buy this album, and you'll want to buy all of the other ones, too.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|\\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" packs enough fun, twists and turns to make two entertaining movies. Renee Zellweger turns in a memorable performance as Bridget an unmarried career woman still looking for Mr. Right in all the wrong places. Suddenly, she has two possible suitors. Her cad of a boss (Hugh Grant) who's probably all wrong for her but feels so right and a human rights lawyer (Colin Firth)who feels all wrong but is probably right for her. Her misadventures with both men will immediately win you over.<br /><br />Now that we've got the plot and review out of the way I'm going to focus on what's different between this edition and the previous one. The first DVD released in 2001 and this one released to coincide with the sequel \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" look exactly the same. There's nothing to distinguish one disc vs. another. Also, many of the special features are the same as well and, contrary to the amazon.com summary, many of these were on the original release as well.<br /><br />The new edition features a handful of new featurettes. Jenny Bicks a writer/producer on \\"Sex and the City\\",  the editor of Allure Magazine and others comment on the difficulties in our narcissistic society. Her comments on finding Mr. Right in a world of Mr. Wrongs are frequently on target and quite funny. It's a standard but occasionally clever featurette that weaves clips from the movie with special footage highlighting the difficulty of finding the right person in a  society. \\"The Bridget Phenomenon\\" focuses on Bridget herself-Helen Fielding. Well, actually according to Helen and the film's director Sharon McGuire Helen really isn't Bridgett. She just assumed her identity for the famous columns she wrote. Interviews with the cast members discussing the perception that being single is full of woe. Fielding discusses the great appeal of Bridget lies in the gap of how their expected to be and how they actually are. \\"Portrait of the Make Up Artist\\" focuses on Graham Johnston the chief make up artist on \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" and the newly released sequel. All the other featurettes and Special Features appeared on the first edition of this funny comedy with the exception of \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" trailer. There's also reviews of the first film on this disc.<br /><br />The original release had the feature commentary by director Sharon Maguire, the behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the movie, deleted scenes. Contrary to the listing here the original Bridget Jones' Diary Columns appeared on the first disc as well. Missing from the new edition are the music videos. That's about it. The film sounds and looks exactly the same as the previous edition.<br /><br />If you haven't purchased the film before or rented it on video but didn't buy the DVD, this new edition is worthwhile picking up. If you have the previous edition, these new featurettes will only make this worthwhile if you will watch them (some folks don't pay attention to featurettes at all or watch them one time)more than one time. All of the new featurettes are quite entertaining but hardly essential.<br /><br />Regardless of which edition you buy, this is a delightful, funny, frothy and clever film that you can enjoy on your own or with a signficant other. Step into Bridget's world and, if you haven't seen this and are going to see the sequel, definitely pick this up first for a delightful introduction to Bridget and her men.ist on \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" and the newly released sequel.

078322611X|4.0|Costner stars as Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, who hears the mysterious words &quot;If you build it, he will come,&quot; and is compelled to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield.  The meeting of Kinsella and shoeless Joe Jackson was one of the best parts of this unusual movie.  While the film has had its many detractors, I loved it, the idea of it, and especially the excellent execution.  That final scene, with the line of car lights streaming out over the horizon, still gives me goose-bumps.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I understand very little French but I absolutely love this album. The \\"hokiness\\" that is sometimes present in her English songs (or, that is, songs written by American lyricists) isn't a concern with this album. The guitar acoustics are wonderful and sometimes paired with catchy vocals and lyrics (\\"Tout l'or des Hommes\\"). \\"Retiens-Moi\\" is upbeat acoustic. Just listen to the samples on Amazon. I've always been a fan of her vocal abilities, but admittedly not of some of her American songs (e.g. \\"Because You Loved Me\\"), even ones that have hit the top 10. Just check out Babelfish (translate function) through Altavista. I love the album. Check out her other French albums - for the musically open-minded, they are generally not a disappointment. Enjoy!
6305364648|5.0|The Amazon write up for this film implies Cameron doesn't like women. But Jamie Lee Curtis does look to be having fun. Yes, us men are going ga-ga for her as she is exploited. But (a) she raked in a heap of money (b) her stunning body has been immortalized in film and (c) how many women can claim to have turned on so many men at the same time with so little effort? (Hint: Curtis may very well be an alpha-female. Maybe and ENTJ.) The action sequences in this film, as in all Cameron films, have a serious true-to-life feel. Arnold may very well be a psychopath as he slaughters deranged terrorist after deranged terrorist utterly without remorse or even blinking an eye. But the way it's done you really get the feeling that the violence is essential to the story and had to be done this way. (Again, unlike Sum of All Fears, which is a major letdown once you know anything about plotting. Why is the leader of The Greatest Nation on Earth not levelheaded? The story's suspense derives entirely from the US President acting like a nincompoop. Which speaks well neither towards Clancy the democrat nor Clancy the patriot.) Which is why Cameron is better than Sam Peckinpah, who filmed Tarkovsky-like action sequences that often seemed out of place. <BR>There's also enough gadgetry in this film to keep the editors of Maxim busy for at least a year. The subbasement of the building Arnold and co-star Tom Arnold work in is a standout true geek heaven. Cameron really delivers the goods.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Seinfeld, and I'd love to own it all so I can watch it at my leisure.  Anyway, I went into Target (Rockhampton, Australia) yesterday to check out the Seinfeld DVDs - I was seriously thinking about buying them.  The prices were : <br />- Season 1&2 are $80 AUD <br />- Season 3 is $80 AUD <br /> <br />So, $160 AUD for 40 episodes.  Given that there are 180 episodes, the total cost of owning Seinfeld will be about 160 * 180 / 40 = $720 AUD.  And, to watch these you will be juggling anything up to 30 DVD disks. <br /> <br />Yeuck.   <br /> <br />As much as I love Seinfeld, I'm not all that keen on paying a $700+ for it, but worst of all I hate the thought of juggling 30 damn DVDs.  So, I'm waiting for higher format disk versions to come out.  Hurry up Blu-Ray !! <br /> <br />I can't imagine too many people out there spending $700 on Seinfeld - and Target's shelves were full of the first 2 packs, and no-one was buying them (or even looking at them) when I was there.  Maybe when all the packs are released they will have a huge discount sale to clear all the stock that isn't moving - at least that's what I hope.  $200 or less would be great for the whole 180 episodes.  Then I would buy the complete set - but I still hate the thought of juggling 30 DVDs.  ;) <br /> <br />All on 1 super capacity disc would be much better.  ;)
0330485377|4.0|Sebold has one previous work to her credit, that being the nonfiction LUCKY, a haunting account of the author's rape at age 18. THE LOVELY BONES is a haunting work as well, but in the literal sense of the word --- for the narrator of THE LOVELY BONES is a 14-year-old girl murdered during the commission of an unspeakable act committed by a quiet, monstrous man of such vileness that the reader wants nothing other than to reach into the pages of the book, grab him, and rip his face off. The victim, Susie Salmon (&quot;like the fish,&quot; as she tells us early on), relates her fate with a poetic matter-of-factness; she is at peace as she narrates, from her heaven, an account of what happened before and after her death as well as the repercussions of her death upon her family. What she wants is that her family achieve peace and that her murderer encounter justice. You can tell THE LOVELY BONES is a going to be sad just by reading the back.....so is that what you want? to cry? just like you did when you read &quot;where the red fern grows&quot; as a child? i think most people picked up this book hoping and praying that it wouldn't be as sad as it seems- and luckily, it isn't. the whole point of the story is how we can overcome loss, even at the darkest hours of our life. i hope that nobody close to me dies in such a horrible way as suzy did, but i know that deep down i will remember this book. hopefully, it gives light to those people who are overcome with terrible loss, and inspiration to those of us who have been lucky enough never to have had a loved one perish. this book is now one of my favorites, because although not all of the characters are likeable, they all overcome some sort of obstacle. If youre one for a page turner like LB, then you might try THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD.  Its funny, harrowing, VERY unusual, and above all, enjoyable and frank. Highly recommended.
B00006V9A0|3.0|...It's a real rip off for the die hard Nirvana fans.  It's good for someone who is just getting into Nirvana,  but for the fans that already have every Nirvana release,  they will be paying about 15 bucks for 1 song.  \\"You know you're right\\" definately is a good tune,  but it's not worth 15 bucks.  Go download it on Kazaa or something,  but don't buy the whole thing.  Only buy this if you're just getting into Nirvana.
B00005JN0T|1.0|If you never read Asimov, then you will enjoy this film. Stuff blows up real good, Will Smith wisecracks and shoots stuff and the co-star adds to the hoochie factor. <br /> <br />But if you read the book, well the phrase \\"Asimov spinning in his grave\\" comes to mind. The idiot screenwriters, treating the 3 Laws of Robotics as a suggestion, created a script full of \\"Crazy Killer Robots\\". This was something Asimov often poked at in his writings. The Outer Limits episode called \\"I, Robot\\" is more faithful than this mess. <br /> <br />What's worse, Alex Proyas, the director of the great \\"Dark City\\" directed this affront to good sci-fi. <br /> <br />And I thought \\"Minority Report\\" was as bad as it could get...
0140277447|3.0|Richtig, many Japanese think in the same way as what David Askew is saying in your quote. Indeed, I think he learned to think that way by reading Japanese authors. Japanese know that the modern Chinese identity is constructed on the hatred against Japanese. That was what Jiang Zemin, the former head of the Chinese communist party, tried to accomplish by the means of national education. We witnessed how successful he was, for example, at this year's Asian Cup soccer game at Chongqing, where the rowdy Chinese supporters' anti-Japanese violence made international headlines. Then, what do Japanese think about this? There are those on the Right who feel irritated by this Chinese ideology. But many, including myself, think that if the Chinese can unite their nation by hatred against Japanese, that is, if the Chinese government can control their people, divert their attention from the internal problems to the outside enemy, and avoid the internal political disaster, let it do so. We don't mind if they hate us, unless they harm us. We just love them back. We worry more about the Chinese political instability. To hatred and anger, we just respond with love and intelligence... at least until something more terrible for both of us happen. Until then, we just swallow all their abuse and love our neighbor, staying intelligent and informed at the same time. That's how we read Iris Chang. We read her in the wider context and knowledge. You may call it media literacy.
B0006284JQ|1.0|When I \\"heard\\" that this CD was available I thought, \\"great stocking stuffer for my young daughter!\\"  I went to purchase the cd at Target....well sorry, ain't happenin'!   <br /> <br />WHY oh W-H-Y would they ruin an otherwise decent CD by making the cover trashy?  NOT something I would allow my daughter to have! <br /> <br />And just WHO is she trying to appeal to??  The 5-12 year old girls who are her largest fan base?   <br /> <br />I think her sales will suffer for her going by the way of Christina Aguilera.....cheap.  It's a shame really.   <br /> <br />THIS mom will go and download the preferred songs off of an MP3 site (legal of course) and make my daughter a decent CD.  <br /> <br />I hope Mandy Moore continues to be a better musical artist by taking the high road and keeping her clothes on.
B00005JMUL|2.0|I LOVE the book upon which this movie is based, and I love Tom Hanks, and most of his films.  I love Christmas and Santa and have actually played an elf in my life.  So why is this expensive movie so hideously off-target?  Because it has no life, and its vision of Christmas and of the North Pole is of a scary looking place that is cold, distant and has no merriment -- a dreary, hellish, Third-Reich of the North.  And for all of the fuss of the CGI wonderment, only the train, with its rollercoaster thrills, comes to life -- the children and people in this movie look like zombies.  The music is either cheesy, over-the-top new stuff (Hot Chocolate, the strangely uninvolving musical number on the train) or classic Christmas songs that play like music in floating through an old radio on the deserted streets of the North Pole - a place as welcoming as a morgue.  It's a heartless vision that virtually drains the magic from the book, which is elegantly spare and has on its mind only one word: believe. This movie is misguided in nearly every way -- calling into question the artistic judgment of those who created it...what were they thinking?  How can you weave magic without caring about someone, or something?  These characters have no life in their eyes -- and it isn't merely the fault of the animation process (think of any of Disney's classics...the characters are more real than some people!)  I'll stick with Miracle on 34th Street as the ultimate believe-in Santa movie, and I still plan on putting the cookies out this year...
B000002HFU|5.0|This album, one of the solo Wu-Tang joints that was released between 1994 and 1997, which I consider the PRIME of the Wu-Tang years, is perhaps one of the best efforts. ODB was an original voice with style to go. Simply put, if you like hip hop you should own this album. No other way of putting it. If you already own and know the tracks backwards and forwards you know how good this album is. It's like George Harrison when he started making his solo efforts after The Beatles broke up. You just get it and you love it because that's the nature of the musical genius on every level; production, lyrics, and execution. <br /> <br />Rest in peace, Old Dirty Bastard. You did your thing and you added an ingrediant to music that was missing for so long: originality with no holds barred.
B0000524CY|5.0|I have seen \\"The Exorcist\\" several tims, and picked up \\"the version you've never seen\\" when it hit the shelves last year. It's amazing how this landmark movie still holds it's power 30 years after it's initial release. I will not bother to try and do this film justice with an amateur review, and unless you have been hiding under a rock for the last 3 decades you most likely know what the story is about. But I would like to touch on two things, the added scenes in the latest version are great. As if you needed any more reason the feel sympathy for Regan, watching her go through the medical tests is just awful. Linda Blair just does such a great job in this movie, it's really a shame her career took such a nose-dive. The other aspect of the film that I really enjoyed with this new DVD package was the soundtrack. It was like watching a \\"new\\" movie with enhanced audio, and with surround sound \\"Tubular Bells\\" has never sounded better. This film may not be for everyone (my wife still refuses to watch it), but if you have the nerves to handle it...well the newest version is well worth the money.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana does it again with this fabulous collection of ear candy that's sure to please his old fans and attract new ones. Carlos' magical guitar on \\"Smooth\\" blends perfectly with Matchbox 20's Rob Thomas's superb voice, and \\"The Calling\\" with Eric Clapton is superb. This CD was well-deserving of its Grammy nods, and the only pity is that it took the music industry so long to reward such an exceptionally gifted artist. I thought \\"Abraxis\\" would never be equaled, but this \\"Supernatural\\" perhaps surpasses. Enjoy!<br /><br />.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This movie is without a doubt one of my favorites.  Nightmares galore when I was a kid, I think it scarred me.  Definately John Carpenter's masterpiece that startled everyone in the late 70s.  The music, the mask, and the atmosphere still freaks me out to this day.  Jaime Lee Curtis did one hell of a job in this movie.  Can't forget the scene where she was in the house finding her friends dead, coming out of one of the rooms and seeing Michael's mask illuminating in the dark closet watching her.  Damn just thinking of scenes sends shivers down my spine.  Not really much I can say about this movie that probably hasn't already been mentioned but, this movie is a MUST HAVE movie in your collection.  Pop some popcorn, turn on the surround sound, dim the lights, grab a blanket, and be prepared for some jumps.  This classic still scares the hell out of me like it did when I first seen it.  As Donald Pleasence said in one of the movies \\"You're talking about him like he is a human being,\\" \\"That part of him died years ago.\\"

B0006284JQ|4.0|Although it's a wee early (ok who are we fooling?? she's only been out 5 years!!) for Britney Spears to release a greatest hits CD, I love it. I am not a fan of her, but I love singing and dancing to her songs. The best song on here and that she's ever released is \\"Toxic\\". I was disappointed that she did not include \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" on the disc, but I guess \\"Everytime\\" makes up for that. As for her new songs, \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\" is a great song. But \\"Do Somethin'\\" is not the greatest. But all in all, a solid effort for this too early greatest hits CD.

0140277447|1.0|I read through the book and I think it is a very nicely written one. One minor point is that it would be nicer to note in the text the references documents in the style of academic articles. That would be easier for readers who are interested in digging into the original documents themselves. Nonetheless, I think that this book gave a very clear view of one of the saddest event ever happened in human history in a way that can be understood by general public.  <br />I strongly disagreed with one of the reader's review for criticizing this book as \\"ridiculous\\". The reasons for my disagreement are as followed: <br />1. Criticizing Point:  <br />\\"Iris Chang is a fourth-Generation Chinese American. She does not speak or understand any of the languages needed to examine this issue (Chinese, Japanese and German). I have concluded that all information used in this book is second-hand information, most of them is propaganda.\\" <br /> <br />Disagreement:  <br />First of all, there are a lot of first hand references written in English, as were listed in the book. In fact, one of the reasons that Nanking Massacre was known to the world was because quite a few Europeans and Americans happened to witness and documented the event. If the reviewer considered none of those documents are first-hand documents, I am not sure what the definition of \\"first-hand\\" information is. In addition, some of the documents are even reported by Japanese themselves. It is not reasonable to report something against their own country if it is not truth, especially during the war time. <br /> <br />Second, according to what the author stated in the book, the author is a second generation Chinese American (not a very important point here, but it implies the reviewer may not read the book clearly before jumping into conclusion). In her book she thanks her parents and many other people for helping her translating needed documents from different languages. Many of these helpers are scholars with knowledge ofmulti-languages. Take her parent as an example, they were born in Mainland China, grew up in Taiwan and received their Ph.D.s from Harvard University in American. Is it reasonable to believe that they have enough knowledge in both Chinese and English to translating some of those documents for her?  <br /> <br />2. Criticizing Point:  <br />The reviewer stated: \\"My great uncle was in the Japanese Army. He told me several times not to believe in this kind of nonsense. It is impossible to kill so many people in such a short period. Especially with soldiers who were not equipped with machine guns or other weapons for mass-destruction. Just take a minute and think. According to my uncle, it took almost 3 days to burn 6 corpses of his comrades after an attack. How long will it take to burn 300.000 corpses?\\" <br /> <br />Disagreement: <br />First, it maybe true to take 3 days to completely burn 6 bodies. However, we were not talking about cremation ceremony here. We were talking about burn to death. How many minutes can a human being endure before he or she was burn to death? Thanks heaven it is not 3 days!! Besides, if the reviewer had read through the book (or any other documents), not all 300,000 corpses were burn, a lot of them were buried or dumped into river. Please read the book before jump into conclusion and make such a harsh criticism. <br /> <br />Second, Japanese soldier did have machine gun. Of course not as powerful as the modern model, but they did have machine gun. Japanese did not start the war un-prepared. Besides, how difficult it is to kill civilians (especially elderly, small children and babies) who have no weapon at all? It did not even need weapons for mass-destruction. In addition, if one likes to play the number, here it is: The number of the Japanese troop invaded Nanking was around 50, 000. The peak of the ciaos was around 6 to 8 weeks. The conservative estimation of casualty is from 260, 000 to 350,000 during that period. Do the math yourself!See how possible it is! I have to emphasize that it is not my intension to use these numbers to prove the Massacre did occurred, that would be too shaky. The real evidences were presented in the book and the documents it referred. I merely use these numbers here to show that one can not use these numbers to claim it is not possible that the Massacre occurred. <br /> <br />Third, though I have no intension to dishonor anybody's ancestor, I have to point out that the credential of reviewer's great uncle's words is really questionable for the following reasons: <br /> <br />Scenario 1: His great uncle was in Nanking with the Japanese army while the Massacre occurred. Then it is possible he participated in the crime (thought may not be voluntarily, I hope). It is a common sense that one can not use the words from the accused as objective evidence. Especially when he or she is denying the crime accused. <br /> <br />Scenario 2: His great uncle was not in Nanking while the Massacre occurred. Then all he knew about the event were from the propaganda in the army, which by all means could only be more misleading than any outside propaganda. <br /> <br />One question I would like to ask here: how many casualties qualify it as a massacre? Even if it is propaganda, even if only 10% or even 1% of the reports were true, it is still a horrible crime. Besides, Nanking Massacre was such a crime not only for the number of civilian casualty, but also the cruel way the victims were killed. Think about it, if one of the women, just ONE, that were tortured, raped, before they were killed were your own mother, wife or daughter, could anyone just shrug and say \\"it is ridiculous, it is just propaganda....\\"? If one of the victims of the \\"killing game\\" (reported by the Japanese newspaper, not Western or Chinese propaganda) is your own father, brother or son, could anyone just shrug and say \\"it is ridiculous, it is just propaganda....\\"?  <br /> <br />A tragedy such as this must not be forgotten if we don't want history repeat itself. Human being will only advance if we can recognize the mistakes we made and put in effort to prevent it from happening again.

B00005JMJG|5.0|Charlie Kaufman has become the go-to-man for scripts that bend time, place, and traditional conventions: he's scored another winner with \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\\"  Teaming with Director Michel Gondry for the second time (they made the semi-flop \\"Human Nature\\" in 2001), they have made a great film, perhaps the best from a Kaufman script.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the unlikely stars, both cast against type.  Carrey excels as a withdrawn and depressed man who meets a free-spirited neurotic, played by Winslet, who's never been better.  The two have a fling and seem to bring out the best in each other, although it quickly devolves.  Winslet decides to have her memories of Carrey erased by Lacuna Inc., which jump starts the time-bending plot.  Kaufman's scripts are always pleasantly off-beat and funny, as is \\"Eternal Sunshine.\\"  However, what Kaufman has added this time around are some keen perceptions about relationships.  Carrey and Winslet manage, against all odds, to portray a believable couple and the results are genuine moments of understanding and heartbreak.<br /><br />Every remaining element of the film is superior.  Gondry's direction is masterful, aided significantly by the cinematography of Ellen Kuras (Blow, Swoon).  The supporting cast are also excellent: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood (as the amusing memory-busters), and Tom Wilkinson.  Overall, this film is the best of 2004 so far and stands poised to become a modern classic.<br /><br />DVD Extras: The DVD is packed, including interviews, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a director's commentary, and deleted scenes.
B00005JMXX|2.0|You'd never know that the special effects juggernaut that is the Day After Tomorrow was based on a book by Whitley Striber, but the one thing you will know is that the never ending surge of CGI enhanced weather disasters are brought to you by the same team that brought us the special effects turkey Independence Day.  There's no point of going into the story since there isn't much of one to describe, just that Denis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are wasted in their roles as a father and son who are caught in the middle of an end of the world-esque weather phenomina that catapaults the planet into chaos.  Make no mistake that the CGI effects are a sight to behold, and the Day After Tomorrow can be taken as a guilty pleasure, but other than that it's as lame as it looks.  Those who want a mindless escape may want to check it out, but even then you are better off with something else.
B0002OERI0|5.0|In the year 2054, people will still listen to American Idiot. Or maybe even enjoy it live off-Broadway.<br /><br />Green Day has pushed the envelope with American Idiot, transcending overtly political overtones to produce a solid mix of songs, scores and pieces that may very well be recognized as the first punk rock musical.<br /><br />Green Day's albums usually have themes that consist of smoking pot, wasting time and being lazy, to name a few. But on American Idiot, Green Day holds no hostages: they attack the current president, the \\"new media\\" and \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" a metaphor for the lazy \\"American Idiot\\" who soaks in propaganda like a sponge.<br /><br />Two of the songs, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" are over nine minutes long, and broken up into five acts. Out of 13 tracks, these two songs in particular set the stage for an American Idiot musical that could rival Tommy and Jesus Christ Superstar.<br /><br />Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and Whatshername are the main characters on the album. Jesus of Suburbia gets his \\"television fix sitting on [his] crucifix\\" and St. Jimmy is Jesus' friend, who later in the album, suffers the same fate as other teenagers who find only one tragic escape from their pain and suffering. Whatshername is a \\"rebel, a saint, and the salt of the earth.\\" She captures Jesus' heart with her defiance of media and propaganda, but in the end, Jesus can't remember her name-only the time they spent together.<br /><br />Green Day has not only woven powerful lyrics and thought-provoking characters into this masterpiece, but they also experiment with a variety of genres, from rock 'n' roll (think Meatloaf) on \\"Rock And Roll Girlfriend,\\" to a catchy march-like tune in \\"Are We The Waiting.\\"<br /><br />American Idiot will not only be recognized for its musical genius within the punk scene, but also as a musical voice that reflects the sentiment of young adults in the post-Sept. 11 and post-war Iraq generation. The sound of American Idiot extremely differs from that of their classic albums, such as Dookie and Insomniac. The obvious political statements may alienate some Green Day fans, but Green Day has never cared about the possibility of pushing people's buttons. No listener can escape American Idiot without being accused of apathy or stupidity in some way.can Idiot extremely differs from that of their classic albums, such as Dookie and Insomniac.

630522577X|4.0|For the ignorants, \\"My Fair lady\\" is an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's splendid play \\"Pygmalion\\". People often say that it is a very bad adaptation, an adaptation that maybe insults the writing of George Bernard Shaw. Maybe the director of the movie, George Cukor is to blame and also the writer that turned it to a musical, Alan Jay Lerner. Whatsoever, they were making a musical out of an excellent play, a musical that was adapted to the period of time it was being displayed to the world, the year 1964, a year located post-McCarthyism and before people realized the conflict in Vietnam, so therefore people was expecting a happy and cheerful musical. <br />To my opinion Audrey Hepburn (goddess of cinema) helped the so called satire the play is supposed to show. Her job in this movie is totally credible, whatsoever I think people expect a poorer looking girl after reading Pygmalion, also she doesn't even sing in the movie, a singer does it for her, known as Marni Nixon. Professor Henry Higgins played by Rex Harrison was not such a credible character as Eliza, I expected a more arrogant man, well in the movie he is a really arrogant man, but Harrison could have put way much more charisma into Higgins since he is a really good actor, whatsoever not a good singer, another fact that maybe \\"Pygmalion\\" was not made for being a musical, since Harrison was never singing just talking really fast, going along with the music. Alfred Doolittle (Stanley Holloway) and Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) were another two excellent performances, since they matched my expectations after reading Shaw's \\"Pygmalion\\" <br />For my opinion Cukor's \\"My Fair Lady\\" could had been a better movie considering the plot, characters, setting, etc, were based on Shaw's \\"Pygmalion\\", having readers with excitement at the beginning of the movie and leaving them with a little disappointment after watching it. Whatsoever \\"My Fair Lady\\" is one of the best movies in the history of cinematography, along with \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"The Godfather\\" trilogy, \\"Casablanca\\", \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", and so on. <br />

Now, I listen to Rob Zombie, Metallica Puddle of Mud and other \\"angry\\" artists and I must say that I was unimpressed with the CD.   <br /> <br />I listened to a few songs and they started out great! Had an awesome beat and put you in that zone. What I don't understand is why oh why do the songs that start out great, end in a fit of angry screaming at the end?  What is the purpose to this? And is it supposed to make me feel good? I find it very annoying and I end up flipping through to the next song.  If they had put those angry portions on the snippets where you can listen before you buy, then I definitely would NOT have bought this CD.

0751362999|5.0|This book is an abridged version of Charles Dickens' original. It is not only shorter, but parts of the language are modernized and therefore easier to understand. It contains all the major important events in the story and is full of illustrations that show a child what London looked like at the time the book was written. The captions of the photographs, drawings, and paintings also explain passages of the book, for example the story mentions an almshouse; the illustrations show what it looks like and explains who it was for and why. One of the characters works at a milliner; a drawing shows what a milliner's shop looked like, another shows a silk bonnet made in one of those stores. We see paintings of the streets of London, the clothing of poor and rich people, the food they ate (e.g. brawn), etc.<br /><br />The illustrations and sidebars give children a much better understanding of the story and the time in which Dickens lived. I highly recommend this book for young readers.
B000667GFK|5.0|Master Work, powerful music. This Album can really show you why he is the artist on top of all others. The pitch and quality make this album elegant and one of a kind. Yet Another Instant Classic.<br /><br />NYC,<br /><br />GA<br /><br />GLito1@aol.com
B00006ZXSK|4.0|Sure, like any rendition of a classic, Ever After has holes you could rear cattle in -- everyone in France inexplicably speaks with a perfect British accent; Leonardo Da Vinci has nothing better to do than to advise a romantic couple in the matters of the heart; a young girl brought up on menial house chores has more grace in hand-to-hand combat than the Prince of France...etc.<br /><br />Yet, amazingly, very little of this goes unforgiven if not totally unnoticed because the movie bears an infectious charm in its rhythm.<br /><br />The script is thoughtful enough to maintain a distance from mickey-mouse concepts of pumpkins and fairies. The dialogue has enough grace to keep anglophiles glued, there's even a wanton skein of humour that makes it all more pleasant than your average garden-variety Cinderella narrative. The roundabout love story is beautifully developed, earning full marks for the screenplay. The visuals of nature, palaces, horse chases etc are stunning, and the costumes full-bodied and colorful. The background score, while not remarkable, makes for an excellent prop.<br /><br />That is in itself a creamy cake, but the film wouldn't be quite the dessert it is, had it not been for some icing in the form of delicious acting all round.<br /><br />I'm not a raving fan of Barrymore but her Danielle is thoroughly likable, sweet without being cloying, confident without being overly theatrical. Dougray Scott does his job as the Prince, but I could see why his character likes Danielle much more than she likes him. The vixen of a stepmother is played immaculately by Anjelica Huston, as are the two daughters and the crones who serve as the domestics.<br /><br />A wholesome film that pulls all the right strings and pulls them fluently. Recommended in a blink.
B0002858YS|4.0|This album is truly hit of miss.  Some of the songs - like the first Single \\"Somebody Told Me\\" - have what seems like infinite replayability.  The first half of the album is like that.  From there, though, The Killers falter - like they used up all their A material on the first few tracks and REALLY wished that they were releasing on vinel, so at least people would know the rest was their \\"B side\\". <br /> <br />All in all though, the album is worth a listen.  I would suggest you buy the tracks you like on iTunes - $10 isn't worth four or five good songs.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you are thinking about becoming a Beatles fan, start with this album. It is packed with many of their hit number one singles, everything from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"Let It Be\\". One CD cannot represent the Beatles fully, and some number ones are missing in action (Back in the U.S.S.R., Strawberry Fields, and Please Please Me being obvious omissions.), but this is a good start to a Bealtes collection. Make sure and pick up the albums as well, as many of their album cuts and lesser known tracks are classics as well. Long live the boys from England!

B0002OERI0|4.0|You have to give credit where credit is due. No matter how much you dislike Green Day, even if you don't like this album specifically, you've got to give them credit for at least trying something different and expanding their musical scope. <br />Personally, I think this album is the best Green Day album ever released.  More than that, I'd call it the most ambitious release in the rock genre this year.  Green Day is ressurecting an almost dead art in the form of rock operas/concept albums.  They've created a very loose story of a struggling teenage outsider growing up today in America.  He is lonely, abandoned, does drugs to try to ease the pain and eventually kills himself. The concept is seemingly interrupted by anti-war songs, but really that's all part of \\"Jimmy\\"'s  world if you think about it. <br />Forgetting the 'concept album' as a whole, going song by song the album falters a little.  Don't get me wrong, songs such as 'Jesus of Suburbia', 'Holiday', and 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' are really good, sure to become Green Day classics.  However, in the middle the album really sags.  Many songs in the middle get skipped ALOT.  Worst of all, 'Whatsername' was pretty much (I hate to say it)ripped off of the Wallflowers 'One Headlight'.  The lyrics and story really make up for anything the songs are lacking though.  This is really an album you need to listen to while reading the lyrics to fully \\"get it\\". <br />On a side note, but importantly, I like the way that 'Jesus of Suburbia' and 'Homecoming' are actually suites of 5 different songs that play as one long song.  This is clearly a nod to The Who's 'A Quick One While He's Away', the father of all rock operas. <br />Overall, the strengths on this album FAR outway the weaknesses.  I can't think of any better rock albums to come out this year.  After such a huge musical leap as this, I can't wait to see what Green Day does next.
B00005AQF7|4.0|Bathtub (6/10) The intro it is aight not all right, it's aight.  <br />G Funk Intro (8/10) Rage with her afro puffs comes in, with good rhymes. And Snoop doesn't really rap but kind of talks, something like that.  <br />Gin and Juice (10/10) You can be a old lady and bump to this, Snoop kind has a party type song, cuz his momma aint home.  <br />Tha Shiznit (9/10) Snoop tells you why he's is the Shiznit, on the beginning of Biggies first album you hear this song in the background.  <br />Lodi Dodi (9/10) a interesting story telling song, with Snoop Dogg on his day out. Running into these crazy women.  <br />Murder Was The Case (8/10) a darker song, on the start of the song Snoop is shot, but through the song he talks about death a little. And things he is going through.  <br />Serial Killa (7/10) D.O.C, RBX, and Tha Dogg Pound are on this one. Six million ways to die choose one.  <br />Who Am I (What's My Name?) (9/10) Nice, this song has the biggiest nuts and guess what? It is I and I am it.  <br />For All My Ni**az & B**ches (9/10) I really like the hook on this one and the verses were alright.  <br />Aint No Fun (If the homies can't have none) (6/10) Nate Dogg says a little too much on the start, but this song is about women that don't want to put out.  <br />Doggy Doggy World (9/10) They tell how this world is crazy it's more to it than that. They spit good rhymes through it.  <br />Gz and Hustlas (9/10) Good intro, this song is to the Gz and hustals.  <br />Pump Pump (10/10) Best song next to Gin and Juice, he is basically telling you don't f**k with him.  <br /> <br />We all know Snoop has lost his mojo, but still makes good music, this is a classic album, that will stay in hip hop's valt forever. You can't be a fan of any type of rap and don't have this album.
B00064X3FE|5.0|One of the best SACDs so far. Clean Crisp and Bold. Good separation on the surround mix by Greg Penny, even thought the back speakers seem to over power some of the later selections at times.  Very little oversaturation. Perfect Vocals. This confirms analog recording techniques were reaching their peak back in 1975.  This is one to show off your system over and over and over again.
038551123X|4.0|A lovable serial killer?  So it seems.  Dex is a fascinating character.  In a world of compromises and justifications, somehow he can love this righteous serial killer right?  THe book moves at a fast clip (although a bit more action might have been welcome in the middle) and has a comic sensibility.  It is also surprising and the mystery is geniune.  I commend Lindsay on something odd, amusing, and cool.  I look forward to July's new Dexter book.
B0002MB7QW|1.0|Like the reviewer who said he couldn't stop laughing while viewing this ridiculous piece of low grade cinema, I, too, found myself laughing and saying out loud to no one in particular, \\"This is just plain stupid.  The effects are not even that great and not even halfway believable.\\"<br /><br />  The only thing that attracted me to this movie was the trailer, which, as it turns out, was the best part of the movie.<br /><br />  Lines like, \\"There are more things to do with books than burning them\\" are just annoying and uncalled for and would make any lover of literature cringe, even under the circumstances that the books were being burned.  (To make a fire in a library fireplace to keep warm-whatever.)  When a guy is sifting through books to toast, he expresses his disapproval over the possible burning of a Nitzsche title.  But lo and behold, around the corner pops a guy who exclaims, \\"Hey, there's a whole section of tax books over here guys!\\" and away they go to add the IRS to the bonfire.<br /><br />  I can't remember the last time I saw Dennis Quaid in anything I was glad I paid money to see, but witnessing Jake Gyllanhall struggle through this two hour mess just made me sad.  An actor with his potential, (re: The Good Girl) should not even be looking at scripts this bad.<br /><br />  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.  It's the end of this movie, and I am glad.<br /><br />  Do yourself a favor the next time you get a hankering to watch a disaster movie and rent something done by Irwin Allen in the seventies.  At least his stuff kept you at the edge of your seat.  I watched this mind numbing yawnfest over three days time and still couldn't stay focused.  Not how a disaster film should make me feel.  Two thumbs down and one nose up.  Avoid this movie.
0393324818|5.0|As a fan of books that you can learn something from, yet are fun to read, this is a winner.  Michael Lewis does a great job of providing just the right amount of depth for the general public on sabermatrics and the data-driven approach to managing a baseball team.  The result is an enlightening and amusing story that will make for a fun read.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Right on the money. Doesn't miss a beat. Creative writing and great performances. The humour and occassional drama come in subtle waves. The boy in this story is definitely the character of Hugh Grant and to the story's credit a second boy,who is of age to be an authentic boy is introduced. He walks into Grant's life and turns everything upside down and they both learn to be men. Instead of going for broad comedy the script is more subtle, focusing on people's dilemmas, contradictions, hypocrisies and even finding humour in their tragic failures. It's really a drama that takes everything very seriously. But because it sees the light at the end of the tunnel, very clearly it teaches us that when life presents an end to something, it also offers a beginning to something else. Let's embrace it!   <br />
B00005B36H|1.0|listen to a perfect circle instead.  tool fanboys are the most pathetic examples of humans, anywhere.  everyone of them would suck maynard off if given the chance.  they act like tool are gods.  they make music..nothing else.  they aren't a spirtual force of unstoppable nature that cures the sick.  they write songs.  yes, they do.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Yes fans are very fickle towards this album, and rightfully so. It is by far their toughest effort to swallow, leaving casual Yes fans sratching their heads. I basically look at this album as some amazing moments squished in between the odd long lulls. The album starts with &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot;, which opens with a monotone chant which is very odd at first listens. It builds up into a great &quot;swirling&quot; keyboard passage overlapped with some bluesy guitar. Very spacey and cool. A neat guitar solo leads us into the high pitched peaks of Jon Anderson's always-amazing vocals. Very &quot;adventurey&quot; sound leads us into a great chorus, capped off by the immortal words: &quot;We must have waited all our lives... for this...&quot;. Really well thought out stuff here people. Fast forward throgh one of the said lulls, my favourite part of the song kicks in. When he starts about &quot;over-hanging trees&quot;. Very beautiful bit, stands out as one of the better moments on the album. And then you get some repition for awhile, a few other cool bits and it's over. WHOOOO doggie, after listening to that one, you know you're in for a hell of a ride!<br />&quot;The Remembering&quot; starts off with some nice fluttery melodies from a flute. This accompanies us into a softly picked guitar intro with some soft singing from Jon and the gang. Very &quot;fanstasy&quot;, great melody, awsome set-up. Later on, it gets a bit more upbeat with the singing of the &quot;...Summers so long...&quot; part. Queue more almost listless singing from Jon and Co., we are thrown into another lull, one that can still be good for a listen here and there. Once again, around the 9:00 mark, my favourite moment of the song pops up. After some spacey, atmospheric keyboards, we are treated to a quick flury of nots from Steve's accoustic. Great singing (&quot;Don the cap and close your eyes, imagine all the glorious challenge&quot;). Amazing guitarwork both times through that section. Around the 15 minute mark (don't quote me), very soft parts take over. Good way to end the song.<br />&quot;Giants...&quot; is a toughie. Very odd structure and choice of intruments. I'm not a big fan of the song, but it is a very interesting listen.<br />&quot;Ritual&quot; closes the album out with a great song. Flowy guitars introduce us to the basic song structure. Great bass lines throughout as well. Jon chips in with some wordless banter. Very cool. Around the 6th minute, Jon decides to stop that rediculous french singing (I'm french canadian, so don't worry, I'm allowed) and starts singing this GREAT melody that you can't help but feel good after. &quot;Seems like a fiiiiiiight!&quot; caps this great part off and leads us into more lully singing and a few uncomfortable bongo hits. Still a great track.<br />So don't give up on the album. You will too be finding out where your favourite bits are, and will be giddy at the thought of sharing it with fellow TfTO fans.

B000056HRZ|4.0|Casablanca, 1942 film   The story is set in Casablanca after the fall of France. Refugees crowd the city, waiting to flee abroad. Rick, an American expatriate, runs a café (with gambling in a backroom). This operation is protected by the local Chief of Police. The first funny scene is where Victor Laszlo, wanted by the Gestapo, appears under his own name! Then he is introduced to the Nazi chief! All so polite (can you believe it?) Rick is said to be on the blacklist, with a price on his head. How did he not just escape, but wind up with a café? I suggest Rick made a deal with the authorities, and works as a high-grade informer. Its not an accident that Yugartes is arrested after he shows up at Rick's and confesses. Rick has knocked around way too much to be so sentimental in Paris. The question is whether the Laszlos will be able to escape to Lisbon, and then to America, with the transit papers. Those German soldiers sing “Wacht am Rhein”, a 19th century nationalist song. “Watch on the Rhine” was a stage play and a later film.   Conrad Veidt portrays the top Nazi with ominous overtones and underplayed evil. Rick shows sentimentality with the Bulgarian couple; was this just a whim or some sort of pay-off to explain a large sum of money? Victor Laszlo escapes from an underground meeting. Wouldn't he be under constant surveillance? There is a surprise ending. Rick double-crosses Louis to let Victor and Ilse leave. The foggy night creates atmosphere (is fog possible in the desert?). Major Strosser arrives, but somehow lacks his usual retinue and pays dearly for his mistake. [Believable? It echoes the fate of Heydrich.] The real scandal is not that Rick and Louis run off together to join the Free French. It is that nobody escaped from the concentration camps of the Gestapo unless they were turned into double agents. This suggests Victor is now a Nazi agent (read some of the post WW 2 books)! The efficient British counter-intelligence would soon deal with him. Or could Rick really be a triple agent, who uses Louis' affection to escape to Allied territory after effecting the escape of Victor and Ilse?   The charm of this film seems to be its classic restraint and understatement with its stilted language. It has unity of time, place, and action. The film is fast-paced and tightly edited. The Hollywood Production Code supported the happy ending where Victor and Ilse’s marriage continued after their hardships. The cleverness of this film is how it layers sentimentality over a rude reality, like some old-fashioned fairy tale that has different meanings for children and for adults I think the happiness of the performers shows in their stage presence. Many were refugees from Nazi Europe. This makes it a better film than “Citizen Kane” and its cynical performers. One flaw is the story of exit visas which cannot be canceled; no government would do that. ‘Force majeure’ trumps a piece of paper.   The book “Round Up the Usual Suspects” tells about the making of this film, whose story transcended the usual money-making entertainment. The popularity of this film was followed by a series on radio, as with other films (“Sam Spade”). That is where “Play it again, Sam” may have originated. There was also a popular novelty tune inspired by this film..
B00005ALP6|3.0|After watching My Fair Lady, my dislike for visual interpretations of literature has increased monumentally. Although the film might have minimal qualities, which would entitle it to the numerous awards it has received, it is an understatement to say that it does not accurately portray G.B. Shaw's Pygmalion. An author who very clearly includes a cynical tone in the play, and the element of satire is indeed the entire \\"make-up\\" of the play, would greatly dissaprove of this film.  <br />It is evident to me that the producers and directors of this musical made a half-hearted attempt at accurately portraying the message which emerges in the play. In fact, I find that Pygmalion was simply an object used to obtain characters and events, yet the main conflict of the play was not at all perceivable in the movie. The idea of a satire is to \\"ridicule or hold up to contempt the faults of individuals or of groups\\". Frankly, the entire concept created by G.B. Shaw was ignored by the makers of this movie. <br />Not only was the play generally not portrayed accurately, but the acting was not exceptional. It is to my belief, that when a movie producer decides to base a movie on a play or novel they should make the ultimate attempt at portraying the characters accurately. After reading the play, my perception of the characters was very extreme. Seeing that the play is a complete ridicule of different social classes, I imagined Henry Higgins as a completely detestable human being. Not physically, but in the way he carried himself, and his treatment of others. In the movie, the transition he made from being a mean and classist person to accepting Eliza was abrupt and unnatural. On a different level the interpretation made by Audrey Hepburn of Eliza, was quite unbearable. She was almost \\"too pretty\\" as a flower girl, and although she did an exceptional job pulling off the accent, her acting did not meet my expectation of Eliza.  <br />The fact that this is a \\"Hollywood\\" interpretationtruly drives the movie away from the play. It is usual for this type of film to include the \\"cheesy\\" aspects of cinematic production, which give it this denomination. The film portrays the story as one of love, rather than the satirical and cynical tale that G.B. Shaw tells. The worst part of this film, has to be the musical aspect. It is very difficult, to portray cynicism through music. In fact, the music makes it quite a ridiculous interpretation of the play. It is definately the wrong script to adapt as a musical film.  <br />On a final note, I have to say that i am definately biased, having read the play prior to seeing the film. I saw the movie with a pre-established view of what i believed would be an accurate portrayal of the play, and was very dissapointed with the result. The movie disregards the objective of the play, taking away the veyr thing that makes Pygmalion an excellent read.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The character of Napoleon Dynamite is one of the most brilliant examples of cinema. Who doesn't see a little bit of his or herself in him? Hell, I owned a pair of those snow boots, drew screwed-up monsters during class, and for the majority of my formative teenage years was forced to endure boring, unimaginative people assuming they had more power and brains than I did.<BR>And Debbie is the greatest: she is everywoman.<BR>And LaFawnda simply made the movie - a small role but so influential.<BR>I am so pleased that this movie, made on a miniscule budget, became such a hit.
0618526412|3.0|Besides this book, I have read \\"A Member of the Wedding\\" by Carson McCullers.  It is very striking to me that when I read each of these books, my mental images of the characters and settings were in black and white.  Well, really, I saw it all play out in shades of gray. The people and places in this book are dark, often dirty, lowly, depressed, depressing and teetering on the verge of hopelessness.       The title aptly states the novel's theme; the overriding feeling of the book is stark loneliness.  The characters cannot connect with one another - even when they are trying very hard to do so.  They don't have authentic relationships even when they think that they have found a soul mate.  Each of them wants to share his or her inner-most truths, and without exception they are impotent in their attempts.  They each have things that they want to do, talents that they want to express.  In each case, they can't or don't overcome their personal burdens to reach their goals or to achieve any sort of success.  In the end, they are each alone with little hope for a more fullfilling life.     The book is very well written.  Each chapter is written as a stream of consciousness of one of 4 main characters who each move the story forward a (very tiny) bit. This book is all about characters.  It is definitely NOT about plot.  McCullers remains stylistically consistent throughout, which seems to be quite an accomplishment in this very ambitious first novel.      For me, reading this book is a literary accomplishment.  I can check off another classic from my list of books to read.  However, it was not a book that I found enjoyable.  I would suggest that ambitious readers should tackle it.  Its style, mood and characters are very effectively created and sustained.  On the other hand, if you prefer plot, uplifting or hopeful themes, happy endings or characters that grow or overcome their limitations, you may not want to spend your reading efforts on this book.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit comes forth with another good album.  A few of the tracks on here were all over radio airplay around when this became released and it has a few classic tracks on here as well.  The album starts off very strong but loses a little a bout a third of the way through.  There are songs to get you pumped up and have very strong beats, while a few are more relaxed and deeper type of songs.  There are a few skippable ones, but for the most part it is a good album and a must have for fans. <br /> <br />#2 - 10 (classic) <br />#3 - 9.5 <br />#4 - 10 (classic that'll make you wanna break stuff) <br />#5 - 9 <br />#6 - 8 <br />#7 - 6.5 <br />#8 - 6.5 <br />#9 - 5 <br />#10 - 9 (f/ Method Man) <br />#11 - 7.5 <br />#12 - 7.5 <br />#13 - 8 <br />#14 - 2 <br /> <br />check all my reviews
B000001DTM|5.0|If Elvis and the Beatles suggested what popular music could become, then U2 became it and this album proved it. The rich textures that comprise these songs never become more important then the songs themselves.  The lyrics sharply bring into focus details from an itensely hypnotic enviroment. Listening to the words is like listening to your friend confiding in you. The genuine doubt expressed within this masterpiece has given me faith. It is beatiful music.
B00005JKC3|3.0|This is a well made movie with its special effects.  However, the story line is not as interesting as the original tv series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.
0553266306|5.0|I just finished reading The Day of the Jackal again more than 15 years after my first read. It hasn't lost a thing over the years and remains one of my top three novels of all time. I think the book is even better than the original movie, although that was great too. Frederick Forsyth is still writing and I've read most of his novels over the years. In my opinion, only the Odessa File came close to this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!
0553212540|5.0|This book is a facsinating read that blends insult and injury quite well.  Fat and ugly people surely will be delighted or destroyed.  Wittisms roar and pundits will roll in hedonism for the intelligentsia.  A must-read for good-looking people and geniuses everywhere.

B000067CPX|4.0|My sentiments are summed up in the title. In my mind, they keep getting better. This album may not have the same profile as BSSM or Californication, but we have an album that embodies musical artistry. let's go through it song by song. <br /> <br />1. By The Way: It's a good song and it grows on you, but this was a little misleading to how the album turns out to be. but a good song that combines the superb basslines of flea to john's sweet melodies. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />2. Universally Speaking: It has a soothing note, but tends to drag on a little without changing the dynamics of the song. this way it can get boring and i find it is the worst song of the album. 6/10 <br /> <br />3. This Is The Place: This song starts slowly but then turns into a song that will stick in your head. It's all good fun. 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Dosed: By far the most mellow track in the whole album. Old skool chili fans will hate this, but is one that you can fall asleep to, such is the calmness of it. All the world's problems can fall away after listening to this. 7/10 <br /> <br />5. Don't Forget Me: One of the best in the album. Starts off with Flea's incredible basslines and goes into John's superb tunes. AK's lead and John's back-up vocals are awesome. All in all, this just combines so well. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />6. The Zephyr Song: Beautiful song, especially when you watch it with the video. Another song where you can just sit back and relax to. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />7. Can't Stop: The best song in the album for mine. Combines the funk of old and the pop of new into a fantastic song. You won't be able to ge this out of your head. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. I Could Die For You: The album shifts back to slow and mellow. But this is another song you can relax to. Anthony's lyrics are beautiful, and keeps the melodies rolling. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />9. Midnight: One of my favourite songs in the album. In all four corners, this song captivates you with its beauty. Starts off with an orchestra and ends with John's sweet tones. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Throw Away Your Television: Initially, I didn't like this song, but it grows on you. Flea is more involved here and it sounds a bit more like the chilis of old. I prefer the version of this song in the 'Live At Hyde Park' album. 7/10 <br /> <br />11. Cabron: Extremely fun song. You could mistake this for a Latin American song. Very catchy. 7/10 <br /> <br />12. Tear: Good lyrics but lacks a sufficient beat. Chad has little involvement and it feels that it doesn't have any climax that songs should have. Seems like the band didn't know if it should be catchy or mellow, and ended up in a mediocre void between. 6/10 <br /> <br />13. On Mercury: Another beat-catching track that makes you beat along with it. Similar to Cabron with its association to Latin music. 7/10 <br /> <br />14. Minor Thing: Sensational song with all members playing a noticeable part. Anthony's lyrics and voice are fantastic, John's guitar riffs and harmonies are elegant, Flea does his job without fuss and Chad is heavily involved. The ending is outstanding. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />15. Warm Tape: Pure chillout track. It goes a long way in summing up this album. Has a consistent beat yet is soothing. 7/10 <br /> <br />16. Venice Queen: Ends the album with a bang. Starts very mellow but expands to be a very catchy tune. Lyrics are beautiful. John is especially noticeable with his clinical guitar riffs and his sweet backup vocals and harmonies. Lovely. 8/10 <br /> <br />This album would probably score less than BSSM or Californication, but it is by far the most thoughtful and reflective album put out by the Chilis. One ought to be thankful that an album like this came out because a lot of ppl don't want to hear another album sounding like their previous work. the chilis keep us interested with their ever evolving music. therefore, i give by the way 7.5 out of 10.
0385513755|4.0|Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is an interesting book for a number of reasons.  It is entertaining yet essentially light reading. It is also filled with tantalizing bits of information about the history of Christianity and a miriad of other related topics including paganism, Gnosticism, The Knights Templar, art history, and the Holy Grail.<br /><br />The most fascinating aspect of this novel is the overwhelming public interest and controversy surrounding many of the assertions Brown makes in this book.  It may be safe to assume that most people have little or no previous exposure to these topics and it certainly has generated extreme controversy in Christian circles. There are no less than 20 books in print that attempt to support or refute the information found in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  I have never seen such polarization over a work of fiction before.  That said, this illustrated edition is just the kind of thing to not only make the reading experience more enjoyable and interesting, but to continue to stir things up by providing visual references for the works of art, architecture, and religious symbology discussed in the text.  Here it is pretty hard to dispute some of the things Brown talks about when it is staring at you in living color.  This would seem to give the book's many detractors more work to do also.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is not great literature by any means, but it is entertaining nonetheless.  I would recommend it especially for the simple fact that it presents ideas that make people think.  This was obviously not the original intent of this work of fiction, but has turned out to be one of its strongest selling points.

1400031362|4.0|The beauty about this intelligent and funny series is that you can read them in any order, once you've finished Book One, \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\".<br /><br />Undoubtedly, a meticulous mind would prefer to read them in the order in which they were written, and I would have chosen this option if the second book hadn't gone astray in the mail.<br /><br />Unable to wait another minute, I dived into book three, and was not disappointed.  What's not mentioned in the blurb is that Mma Ramotswe has far too much on her plate, and is forced to share the spotlight with the efficient and intelligent Mma Makutsi, now promoted to Assistant Detective of the agency, with the added responsibility of managing Mr. Matekoni's auto repair business.<br /><br />While her boss is out of town sorting out the worries of a rich Government man whose concern for his younger brother and inheritance has poisoned his mind, Mma Makutsi takes over the story completely, devising methods to select a deserving and scandal-free beauty queen, while at the same time anchoring two businesses, and trying to keep them both afloat.<br /><br />This is really the story of the quiet and homely secretary who matured into a feisty, albeit plain swan.<br /><br />Amanda Richards November 14, 2004
B00000AFFF|1.0|The 2 fab tracks are THE SWEETEST PUNCH and TOLEDO. The rest is utter crap. And it's Bacharach's fault since he's the only one with any talent anyway. Costello continues to wring his precious song-lyric metaphors for all they're worth. Check out the ultra-emetic MY THIEF (or better yet, don't) with its precious girl-singer mewling about a \\"perfect alibi\\". It made me wanna fwow up all over Elvis's collection of cutesy-poo hats.
0156027321|3.0|Funny, I most enjoyed the begining of the book of Pi's life in India and the zoo. The rest of the book began to drag for me after a while. If the author was trying to show how boring being lost at sea is by boring the reader, it worked. Surprisingly, I wished the story had continued more afterwards, I would liked the story to continue in Canada.
B000062YAZ|4.0|Slayer's Reign in Blood is generally considered their crowning achievement, a landmark of speed, intensity and ferocity. In many ways it is, most of the songs here are blazingly fast. Many of them are well over 200 BPM and zip by in little more than two minutes. That is my little gripe with this album. Songs like Necrophobic,Piece by Piece, Reborn, Epidemic seem like just a blur. They fail to leave a lasting impression. They are not bad songs by any length, but neither are they really great. Thankfully, this album has a few great songs. The best is Angel of Death. Its lyrics are about Joseph Mengele, the Nazi officer. It starts off the album with its intense beginning. Then it really starts to get good. It moves into a speedy but catchy section with exceedingly gruesome lyrics about the effects of Mengele's experiments. Then it hits with a great riff and a couple of really atonal crazy solos. It really wins you over by the time its all over. The next two songs are a blur until you hit Altar of Sacrifice. Altar of Sacrifice is another really good song even with its really stupid Satan lyrics. Jesus Saves has a slow intro but gets fast too with some lyrics about religion. The next few songs are OK before Postmortem. Postmortem is a really catchy mid tempo song. It is really good before it gets fast at the end. The final real song on the album is Raining Blood. It also features a good riff and some lyrics about purgatory and hell. Its a great song despite some odd thunder and rain effects. The final songs are extras like Aggressive Perfector (a remake of an older song) and a remix of Criminally Insane(the original is better). All in all, this album is quite rewarding. If you like speed rather than more mid tempo thrash, you will love this album.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|'Memento' is a very well made film. The main character Leonard makes genuinely surprising discoveries throughout his search for the man who murdered his wife. This is a revenge movie in which I actually felt sympathy for the protagonist, for, though 'Memento' is primarily a thriller, it does not gloss over the sorrow Leonard feels about his wife. Unfortunately, Leonard is also very confused and vulnerable because the man who killed Leonard's wife also injured Lenny in the head, causing him to have very short short term memory. One of the main themes of 'Memento' is how crummy people are - and how people will manipulate each other at any chance they get. <br /> <br />'Memento' is famous for being told \\"backward\\". One thread plays forward, another, which involves most of the action in the story, works backward, scene by scene. It works well, and is more than a gimmick. The climax is neither predictable nor over the top, and is one of the best I have seen in a while. <br /> <br />The acting is astounding, particularly by Carrie Ann Moss. As her character gradually unfolds, the viewer sees the greatly varied facets of her personality. Joe Palantino is an excellent actor, and he is perfectly cast as an untrustworthy but seemingly helpful cop. Guy Pearce successfully plays Leonard Shelby, who is alternately lost, driven, disciplined, and frazzled. Each main character is sympathetic in some way but has a supremely unpleasant streak. <br /> <br />Due to its intricate plot, carefully attended details, and complex character motives, 'Memento' holds up on repeated viewings. Highly recommended.
B0000CDL93|5.0|That no, in this case it does not. Regardless of whether you believe that the assasination of JFK was a conspiracy, this movie is well worth the time. It is significant for its courage in bringing to the front of viewer's minds the thought that yes, our government can, and sometimes does, conceal the truth from its people. This movie's scope is not simply the assasination of John F. Kennedy, but the naive belief that our government, and indeed any government, should be blindly trusted. By reminding us that all power corrupts, this film illustrates the simple fact that every citizen must question his government's motives and actions, and that in order for democracy to continue, information must flow freely.

B00068IOWM|5.0|This album appealed to me on the first listen (it's playing on the radio and being distributed on the web at the present moment). The Edge dominates, which is a U2-trademark, but his guitar is not overwhelming. Bono's vocals are passionate, which is another U2-trademark. As far as the songs go, U2 blow the house down. There's rock, ballads and romance in this album. I've been a U2 fan since 1983 (the War album) and I think Atomic Bomb will rank as one of U2's finest. This is not hyperbole: Atomic Bomb is as good as Joshua Tree or War. Sometimes a particular song outshines the rest (Pride on The Unforgettable Fire), but not on this album. There are several thrillers. As Bono would say, \\"Make sure your CD holder has a copy.\\"
B00005JNDX|3.0|Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and (especially) Colin Firth are three actors I'm willing to give any benefit of the doubt to, but \\"Edge of Reason\\" really tested my patience in that regard.  These three professionals try their collective best to breathe some life into this slight tale, but only marginally succeed.<br /><br />Blame the material - the original 'Bridget Jones' penned by Helen Fielding basically invented the chick-lit genre (or at least brought it to the collective consciousness of the UK/US public).  Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually) helped Fielding bring it to screen, as directed by close Fielding friend, Sharon Maguire.  'Edge of Reason' - the book - was shunned by most of the audience that flocked to the original.  It comes across as a stretch.  And what doesn't work in print definitely falls flat on the screen - a call girl-backed rendition of 'Like a Virgin' in a Thai jail (don't ask) for example did not succeed in elicting a single laugh from the audience.<br /><br />Too bad, because these three deserve better.  Hugh Grant was quoted recently as saying he was contemplating 'retiring' from film.  If so, it'll be a huge loss - this guy makes it look so effortless.<br /><br />One other point is how abysmally under-used some of the actors are - Jim Broadbent might be one of world's foremost character actors.  We get a couple of shots of him in a lavender tux.  He has maybe ten (at most) lines througout, none memorable.  A waste.<br /><br />And, amongst Bridget's support crew, we get Jude, played by Shirley Henderson.  Since the release of \\"B.J.'s Diary,\\" Henderson has gone on to star in \\"Intermission\\"  and \\"Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself,\\" both to critical acclaim.  Yet, she's completely part of the woodwork here.  Another lost opportunity.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I watched `Love Actually' with an eclectic group of friends last Friday night. And even though we all thought that the movie (which traces the seemingly separate love stories of several couples - and some love triangles) didn't quite gel together we all agreed that it was a true \\"feel good\\" picture and overall an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.<br /><br />With a simply incredible cast that toplines a number of the major British actors (Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley) the movie does occasionally seem unwieldy and top heavy. But the most common effect throughout the group of us who sat through it last week was smiles as the simple charm of the picture wins you over.<br /><br />This is a hard picture to give a brief synopsis of the plot for. There is so much going on and a lot of which appears unrelated that all one can say is the film tries to convince us that love is everywhere. We have a newly elected single British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). An author taking a working holiday in France (Colin Firth). A young bride (Keira Knightley) whose best man comes to realize he also loves (who can blame him) and a young boy who loves an American girl who is returning to the USA and a number of other stories. Stories that all come to a satisfying conclusion by the time the end credits roll.<br /><br />Another notable highlight of the movie is the soundtrack and as our group tried to figure out what the connection was between all people in this movie we all decided that regardless of how well it turned out - the soundtrack was a winner. With its selection of favorites one of the group exclaimed `I think this movie has all my favorite in it.'<br /><br />So, if you feel like getting into one of the best `feel good' movies of the past year (or any year) or simply want to watch an all-star cast at the top of their game then `Love Actually' needs to be on your list. It's a good reminder that entertainment comes in many different forms  - just like love.- just like love.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Well, I finally got to see this one and I am kicking myself that it took me so long to get around to it.  What a wonderful film! It is so creative and romantic and beautifully acted that I was riveted to the screen.  Carrey - who usually makes me really crabby - is just great here.  I can't even describe how this film finally changed my opion of him.  Winslet is like a piece of of eternal sunshine, Dunst, Ruffalo, et al. are each excellent.  This movie is funny, moving, suspenseful and romantic all in one. Beautifully filmed and with a great score, I can't recommended this one enough.
0800141326|4.0|It was my understanding that TOHO, Co. LTD. gave permission to the United States to make a version of their &#34;Godzilla&#34;, to which every rule was ignored.  In 1962, The United States had given the Japanese permission for the use of &#34;King Kong&#34; in King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962).<br />  Excitement grew of the United States making a CGI-effects Godzilla and not a man in a costume.  The theatrical trailers would not show all of the new image of Godzilla and now we know why.<br />  Many fans were in disgusted shock of how Godzilla's face and head looked.  He had a triangle flat head with a rectangled face.  Nothing like the Godzilla we had loved to watch when we were a youngster.<br />  The best of casting was Matthew Broderick in the lead.  Not the over-muscular, macho-type, but a regular-Joe and I think that would please the Japanese as well.  Matthew Broderick is certainly a well liked actor in America.  Broderick plays &#34;Nick Tatopolus&#34; who can shock earthworms out of the ground.  His study concludes that the earthworms are much bigger than the norm.  Suddenly, the army arrives and he is re-assigned to search for the giant creature that is making its way to New York City.<br />  All in all, it's not that bad of a film if you are really in a Godzilla mood and the special effects are 100% better than what TOHO, Co.

B000002AGN|5.0|A lot of people must have approached \\"Time Out\\" with great suspicion on its release: a \\"cold\\" jazz pianist leading a quartet in odd tempos.  What could be more squaresville than that?  But Dave Brubeck was so inspired in the conception that it could not fail; if breaking jazz out of the 4-4 trap ultimately led the music down cul-de-sacs it was worth it for the sublime melodies and brilliant use of rhythm.  It didn't hurt to have first-rank players, especially Paul Desmond, who if he owed a lot to Stan Getz made his own mark with his understated, smooth, supremely eloquent approach to the sax.    One of the all time great recordings, excellently remastered, and a must for any music lover.
B0002S64OG|5.0|This is one of the most-watched videos in the house.  Our girls love the toys-and-music segments - and some of the toys are so cool I find myself watching right with them!  The language and math development sections are very useful and accessible.  They're a great way to help us prepare our young minds to develop and grow.  Bravo!
B00005JM0B|3.0|This is film is lucky it got 3 stars. I am disappointed in the remake, it ends terriblly like Dr Strangelove, but unlike the Kubrick classic it isn't a comedy ( I don't think) it is hard to tell, it is a mix of romance, comedy, suspense and mild horror - how in the hell can that happen? I'm all for new ideas but this is not new, or even remotely thrilling to watch. Arnold Schwarzenegger is back (sadly) as the teminator, another good one (sadly) you know what will happen from the start, the terminators will arrive in the present, one good and one bad, the bad one will chase the good one who's the robotic bodyguard of to hapless little f**ks and it all end in an explosive climax (yawn).  <br />  <br />  I am also very very sad because I actually pray for crappy director James Cameron to take the helm from Jonathan Mostow (who may as well have pointed the camera at the moon all the way through, it would have been more interesting) although Cameron does have a tendancy to use shoddy special effects and unusual camera positioning to show his production.  <br /> <br /> Arnie is too old, a woman terminator is not what should be done and the storyline is too shaky and far-fetched to believe, but enough with the faults - what are the good points? <br /> <br /> * It made me laugh through sheer tedium  <br /> * Arnie's star glasses are fun shame he crushed 'em <br /> * They used an assortment of fun vehicles - Crane, Hearse and a Camper Van. <br /> <br /> The worst thing though is at the end he said \\"this is just the beginning\\" - OH-NO, does it mean, surely not, oh-no he's back and only 70 years old! I really do hope they don't ruin the terminator saga even more by laying open to the poor film viewing masses Terminator 4: Rise of the very old rusted-up banger machines!!!
B0000CDL93|2.0|This film is without question effective and engrossing, done by a very talented director. <br />As a history of the Kennedy assassination, however,  it is a horrible joke, all the worse because people take it at face value. Stone comes from  the 'throw-it-all-at-them' school of conspiracy theories, where he's completely unconcerned whether all of his facts are correct, fit together, or even contradict each other; he just wants you to accept something, anything. <br />He had been a hero to me before this film, with 'Salvador', 'Platoon', and 'Wall Street', but he lost me completely and forever with this cynical pack of lies. He surely knew that much of what he was putting out here was false but did it anyway. An absolute disgrace. <br />To go through all the evidence here is, naturally, impossible, but perhaps one typical example wouldn't go amiss: Stone calls Oswald a good American, just trying to live a good life. Here's the truth, well-established and documented. Oswald bought the rifle and was even photographed with it, photos verified by top experts.  He used the rifle to try and kill General Edwin Walker 6 months before, a fact verified by forensics and by the testimony of Marina, to whom he admitted it. On the night before the assassination he stayed with Marina (they were separated), breaking what had been his habit (he generally only stayed on weekends), because he had to pick up the rifle which was kept in the garage. He took it with him, in the guise of 'curtain rods' wrapped in paper (what a phenomenal coincidence, to have taken something the same shape and length as a rifle to work the day of the assassination!!), to work the next day. That morning he left his wedding ring and almost all of his money with Marina (what a coincidence, to have done this on the day of the assassination!). Then, after the assassination, he abruptly left without speaking to anyone, rushed home to grab a pistol, left immediately, entered a cinema without paying (I'm skipping the murder of the policeman, assuming him a \\"good citizen\\")then fought a policeman who approached him, even pulling the trigger, which didn't fire. All of this is fact and well-documented by unimpeachable sources. Does this sound like the actions of an innocent man to you, as Stone would have it? What a joke!!! <br />If you must see this thing then enjoy it as drama, taking the rest with a grain of salt. I know there isn't the least chance of this, however.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface 1983, it is probably the most renowned and eagerly celebrated gangster film of all time, it can live up to and conquer the onslaughts thrusted at it from various gangster films, even masterpieces such as Goodfellas and The Untouchables cannot compete with this.  <br /> <br /> Al Pacino is absolutely phenomenal in this epic, he plays his part to perfection and gives himself a chance to be remembered as a true film god, he excels as Tony 'Scarface' Montana and his reputation to actually be a hard-assed gangster is seriously emphasized. He is backed up by Michelle Pfeiffer and sublimely presented onto the screen by a directing genius Brian De Palma, the long film is not only one that will keep you glued to the set from start to finish with explosive fire fights, fantastic scenes of sheer gore and a bit of romance too, but it also conveys a powerful message, that there could be blokes out there like 'Scarface' and that what he says may well be true, like he said ' we need people like him so we can point our f***ing fingers and say, that's the bad guy' and I think fantastic memorable quotations like that make the film even more interesting. <br /> <br /> I am not sh***ing you, this is one of the best films in the world, honestly I tell 'Scarface' is my little friend and I beg you to watch it!! NOW!!    <br />
B0002YLC24|4.0|Unfortunately I had the bad luck of reading some of the reviews where the ending was given away. Still, I wondered how and where it was going to take place, so it wasn't a total loss. Even though many, if not all, of the reviews gush rhapsodically about how great it is...I wasn't quite so knocked out. It IS a good ending, and it IS well executed. But as it fades out, I kept thinking how much that moment played out like a moment of episodic television - GOOD episodic tv, mind you, but it was underwhelming, not the greatest ending in the history of cinema. Actually I was a little worried during the scenes taking place in the cafe. Poor Ethan Hawke's character was on the verge of letting his romantic interest be subverted by Celine's need to talk about her boyfriend problems, turning Jesse into a \\"GOOD LISTENER\\" - making him a \\"friend\\", i.e. dead to rights in the romance department. Luckily for our pair, he corrects himself. Actually, for those wanting more of these two, a PERFECT \\"epilogue\\" of sorts, can be found on Linklater's earlier effort, \\"Waking Life\\". I won't spoil it, but check it out - the scene with Jesse and Celine (you can find it on chapter 5: \\"Death and Reality\\"). You can pretend it's what happened after the music stopped.
B000002J09|5.0|...the most influential rock record of the post-60s era. Led Zeppelin's highest selling album is certainly a level up from their first three and takes a step in a new direction with songs like \\"When the  Levee Breaks\\" and the band's most famous rock n' roll anthem, \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" by creating a whole new sound and giving life to whole new genre of rock, \\"heavy metal\\".<br /><br />1. Black Dog: The album's first track has a blazing guitar riff and an overall vibe that is reminiscent of older Zep songs like \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".<br /><br />2. Rock and Roll: A screaming, fast-paced rocker with a whole lot of energy and excitement, that unfortunately got over-played to the point that every time I hear it I think of a big black Cadillac Escalade careening through the desert with a trail of dust behind it. Still worth a listen.<br /><br />3. Battle of Evermore: What was the battle of evermore? No one is quite sure, but the beautiful piece of acoustics and harmonies keeps you distracted from the thought. The lovely little third track is one of my favorites on IV.<br /><br />4. Stairway to Heaven: The song of the album. Not my personal favorite, but still an emotional epic that defined rock a decade later. Starts off slow, but builds to a gripping finale featuring one of the greatest guitar solos from Mr. Page.<br /><br />5. Misty Mountain Hop: A bouncy little number singing about hippies or something beyond. Really will make you \\"Hop\\", all the way to the Misty Mountains.<br /><br />6. Four Sticks: The sixth track is definitely not the best; a droning song with a weak guitar riff that really drags towards the end of the five-minute piece.<br /><br />7. Going To California: A mellow, pleasant little piece that may be boring to one listener but beautiful to others. Certainly not as energetic as, say, \\"Black Dog\\" or \\"Rock and Roll\\", but very well and artisticly written nonetheless.<br /><br />8. When the Levee Breaks: My favorite track. Led Zeppelin once again tries and succeeds at performing a raging, riff-carrying blues number. The guitar riff towards the middle is simple, yet epic, and a wonderful way to end a wonderful album.<br /><br />If you want infuential music, that is old yet still very alive in the music world, and want to get into this great classic rock band called Led Zeppelin, you now know where to start.rack.

B00005JMAH|1.0|Wow. That's really how you sum it up in one word. Only instead of a bright happy cheery wow, it's a shocked, disgusted, amazed (in a bad sort of way) wow. There are about three perks to this movie. 1. You get to make fun of Daniel Radcliffe's continuously declining (can they decline anymore?) acting skills. 2. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, and Rupert Grint remain funny/cool. Come on, you can't say Alan Rickman's bad (think Dogma). 3. There was an Indiana Jones reference. You can't deny that utter coolness right there (Check the quotes and trivia. You'll see what I'm talking about). Now, for the bad. It was unrealistic- when do go to a shopping area (Hogsmeade) and walk down a completely empty road? And invisibly holding a lollipop, even more! And why did we not find out the nicknames of his Harry's father and friends? That could come in handy when Harry writes letters to Sirius (Addressing them to Padfoot) at the beginning of the next book! Or what about the werewolf? Since when do werewolves look like THAT? Yeah, that poor thing looked kind of like Gumby on crack. And the sexual tension was too much. It was fogging up the screen. Put it in subtly please? Weren't Ron and Hermione supposed to be mad at each other pretty much the whole time? There was about one argument. That was it. Yeah. All in all, if you're watching this, I hope it's for humorous intentions only. Or you're taking clips for a movie titled \\"How Not to Make a Movie\\". Hey, they have to listen to me. I'm their money. One more movie as bad as this one, and there goes their funding. Right down the drain.
0140277447|3.0|Unfairly some people evaluate comments without reading them. Some support only 5 stars, others only 1 star. Some customer reviews can be highly ideological and dogmatic, they can be extremely violent in the language they use, and they can be more than careless with the historical facts and sources.     I remembered the article \\"New Research on the Nanjing Incident\\" by David Askew (an Australian professor, neither Chinese nor Japanese), when I read many comments by Chinese and Japanese. Now I understand what Askew said. If you are interested in \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", I recommend you to read the article.  [...]  I quote from it.    In this paper, I have attempted to shed some light on the state of research of the Nanjing Incident today.    First, to put it mildly, Nanjing is a controversial topic. Although our understanding of the events of Nanjing does not even begin to approach our understanding of the holocaust, in both instances there have been tendencies to demonise anyone who budges from the orthodox position. The problem is that the orthodox position is completely different in China and Japan, and within Japan itself three distinct orthodoxies have emerged. Although there is real debate in Japan, no one there now accepts the figure of 300,000 victims as plausible, while in China the figure is set in concrete (both figuratively and literally) at the entrance of the Memorial for the Compatriot [Chinese] Victims of the Japanese Massacre in Nanjing. It would be unfortunate if the debate were to continue to run on parallel lines, never to come together to produce a deeper, more complete and transnational understanding of this historical event. How to overcome the obstacles, on the other hand, poses a dilemma. As long as much of the debate is dominated by ideologues, the sensible option for historians may well be to keep their heads down and research other topics. That, however, cannot be a desirable outcome. Historians surely have an obligation to combat the tendency to use Nanjing as a weapon in contemporary ideological and international contests.    Second, too many Japanese authors are insensitive to the fact that Nanjing for better or for worse has become a central plank in the construction of the modern Chinese identity. To discuss Nanjing is to threaten this self-identity. Those who participate in the debate, therefore, need to show some sensitivity to it. I am not arguing that the Chinese orthodoxy needs to be accepted without question. Indeed, my own position is that it is more dangerous (at least in the long term) to found national identity on a lie than to discover the truth and live with it. However, some effort does need to be made (at both extremes of the debate) to avoid the use of violent and inflammatory language, and to show a much greater awareness of and sensitivity to the moral implications of historical inquiry.    Third, historians are obliged to examine calmly the primary materials and reconstruct the history of Nanjing on the basis of what those materials say. Some who write on Nanjing clearly want to absolve the Japanese of all blame, while others want to depict the Japanese as a uniquely brutal and ruthless race. Neither position should form the starting point of any discussion of the events in Nanjing - although, of course, either might be the conclusion of any such examination. The publication of as many primary materials as possible is clearly an essential condition to this approach, so the discovery and publication of as much as possible must be encouraged.    Finally, a dialogue among historians working on the Nanjing Incident needs to be promoted. One such forum can be provided by the English language, where researchers from both Japan and China can debate with researchers from third-party countries such as the USA, Canada Britain and Australia. The problem with the Chinese and Japanese language discourses is that they are both so insular and the political environments are so charged. It is in the market of ideas and through constant debate (including, perhaps, the mediation provided by third-party historians), that the truth will be approached.
0790729628|1.0|This has to be the worst movie I ever watched... or sorry, I should say worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. I don't understand how people love this movie. It's boring and stupid. Also the acting is terrible. Harrison Ford at his worst!!!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's new album is truely amazing.The song My Happy Ending is the song I saw on TV once that made me start discovering the music world!I love the song &quot;Together,&quot;I could listen to it all day!<br />Don't Tell Me is also a very good song.What I really like about it that its saying not to let anyone take advantage of you and stick up for yourself.Avril proves that not all Canadian talent is crap(like some people say).<br />If you don't have this CD then get it,NOW!
B00005JMUL|5.0|I am telling everyone I know to go see this movie in 3D at the IMAX, whether they have kids or not.  The animation is great, the story is wonderful, and the 3D is amazing!  I have a low tolerance for cheesy things, but this movie doesn't go there.  There is one moment that gets a little sticky-sweet, with a sappy ballad to go along with it - if you like \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" and \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", you'll like the song, if not, take a restroom break then. But other than that, the story kept my attention.  This was the first movie in a long time that I didn't notice time passing, and when it ended, I was surprised that an hour and a half had passed. I do HIGHLY reccommend that you see the 3D version, although it might be a little too scary for very young children.  If you wouldn't take your child on a big roller coaster, you might not want to take them to the 3D version.  But GO SEE IT, it's a holiday classic, one that they should show at the IMAX every year.  Oh, and I have been stuck living in the south for 13 years now, but this movie reminded me what it's like to actually have snow falling down on you, the 3D effects were that good.  Just GO SEE IT!
076790592X|5.0|An old, dying professor, Morrie Schwartz, continues to teach and touch peoples lives, even after his death.  Tuesdays with Morrie is a great novel by Mitch Albom, one of Morrie's college students, and deserves a five star rating for all the lessons it teaches people about life.  Mitch Albom takes a creative approach for writing this book; he goes back and forth between past events with Morrie that happened during college and current events with Morrie after graduation.  The story begins with Morrie Schwartz having been diagnosed with a deadly disease called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  Instead of being depressed and sad, Morrie started to write philosophies about the deadly disease.  Mitch eventually found out about Morrie's condition and decided to visit his favorite old professor.  They bonded like in the old days and the professor started to teach him about lessons in life.  Although, Mitch gives an amazing description on the type of  person and teacher Morrie really was, one little thing that was upsetting was the recorded conversations between the two; many readers can benefit from reading as the book encourages one to cherish the real meanings of love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Morrie was a intelligent, friendly, humorous, and an optimistic human being whom everyone loved.  His outlook on life was so grand even with his horrible illness.  A perfect day to him is gathering his friends at home, eating a wonderful dinner, and dancing.  Enjoying the plants and outdoors was his way of life.  Most people overlook the beauty of the outside world, but not Morrie.  He appreciated all things that nature had to offer.  In this book, he shows us a different perspective of life and things that really matter, especially family and friends.  Some other important lessons taught in the book is about the fear of death, why society acts certain ways, and how important it is to forgive.  Even though Morrie knew he was dying, he tried to make the best out of the timehe had left. <br /> <br /> One aspect about the book that did not appeal to me was the recorded conversations the student had with his teacher.  The poor, old man was dying and Mitch was recording his conversations every week they met.  Morrie probably did not mind because he was a kind soul, but still it was kind of upsetting.  Maybe Morrie would have shared more with us if he had not been recorded!! <br /> <br /> People reading this book will find it of value because everyone can relate to one or more of the topics being discussed.  This book has people thinking about the true meanings of life.  We should be thankful for being healthy and being close to our family. The simple pleasures of life itself is worth more than anything.  Morrie's positive and comic attitude for dealing with his disease can help people have a more optimistic way to cope with their own illness.  <br /> <br /> This book is filled with so much emotion and love, it is just overall phenomenal!  Mitch Albom has done a fantastic job by sharing with us the values of life that Morrie taught him.  During the last fourteen weeks of Morrie's life, Mitch changed from being the busy man whose life was all about his job, to a man just simply enjoying the finer things life has to offer.  It is so indescribable to see such a strong bond between a teacher and a student.  Tuesdays with Morrie will most likely change its reader's way of life in one way or another.  It had me forgive one of my dearest friends for an incident that happened a couple of years ago.   <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I haven't gotten this yet, but I know it's going to be five stars because it's Live Aid!    I have an audio bootleg of the whole show, minus a track or two. So I know what was played--as I said, minus a track or two. And I checked out the tracklisting for the DVD. There is stuff missing, but not as much as you might think.    I don't blame Led Zep at all. They played Live Aid with two new drummers, had only a brief practice with Tony Thompson and Phil Collins, and hadn't played together in 6 years. As I said, I have their set on audio--and they were *terrible*. I like Led Zep but I skip past them on my Live Aid CDs. It was probably the worst they ever played in their career. Sloppy, out of beat, out of tune, Plant's voice was out of shape--I'm not surprised they didn't give permission to have any of that abomination included.    Someone said that Queen's whole set (the set of the show, IMHO, and I'm not a huge Queen fan) was included. True. But other artists seem to have their whole sets included--U2 for sure (yes, they only played 2 songs, because \\"Bad\\" went on for 14 minutes!). I believe Dire Straits only played the two songs included as well. Bowie's whole set, which was brilliant, is here. I think that that's Clapton's whole set as well.     The artist that got screwed? The Cars. One song, and it's the completely boring \\"Heartbeat City\\"? I wonder if Ric Ocasek had a say in that, because he's always had an unhealthy attatchment to that song (I've always wondered why they even *played* it there). Meantime, the stunning version of \\"Just What I Needed\\" is not included. That's the biggest loss.    Elton John has only one song missing from his set: \\"I'm Still Standing\\". Now, I'll miss that, because it's a version that really kicks [...]. However, I understand why they left it off--it might kick [...], but it's badly out of tune!    I would've preferred The Pretenders' whole set--they were amazint that day--and I'll miss the Beach Boys' \\"California Girls--Help Me Rhonda\\" medly. But I do have those on audio.    Other than that? The highlights are all there. I can't wait to buy this set!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is great, I am a huge fan of tool so obviously, I came to love APC.  <br /> <br />Maynard James Keenan has the best voice ever. I suggest the band Tool, and Grain, they are a band from texas, who aren't popular yet, but will be.  <br /> <br />To rate this cd under a 5 is a crime, in itself.  <br /> <br />Best songs: The Outsider, The Noose, Blue, Lullaby, Weak and Powerless.
B000009CEM|1.0|This album gets one star for cars. that's IT. when i first heard that song...i instantly knew i had found the perfect industrial band. heavy riffs, but very melodic. in cars, the sound of the guitar is JUST how i like it, and the dude's voice is absolutely perfect. i LOVE that song. but noooo...when i pick up this album, all i hear is a bunch of friggin screaming, a barrage of drums and a solid wall of guitar. it SUCKS. it sounds exactly like slipknot. down with fear factory. down with slipknot. GO SYSTEM OF A DOWN!
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is worth the money. You're getting 18 Led Zeppelin songs on 3 discs all recorded live at California in '72. Some of them are over 20 minutes long and are overtaken by solos by Jimmy Page. Especially on Whole Lotta Love which is a 23-minute song. He also plays very well in the 25 minute Dazed and Confused song. You get to hear an extended version of Moby Dick, one of the best drum solos from John Bonham with no stops for 19 minutes (way better then the 4 minute album version). You hear Robert Plant at some of his best moments in almost every song except solo parts. <br /> <br />If your unsure about buying this because you never bought any Led Zeppelin albums before you will not be disappointed at all. I do recommend buying the Complete Studio Recordings before this if you're new to them like I am but I bought this and the Complete Studio Recordings in a week's time. If you like rock/blues/acoustic/metal music with guitar/drum solos played throughout almost every song then I recommend this. <br /> <br /> <br />CD-1 <br />1. LA Drone- (: 14)-N/A <br />2.

B00000JLWW|5.0|This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I have watched it over and over again. And I will continue to watch it over and over again. Leonardo Di Caprio's role as Jack Dawson whose is so deeply in love with the beautiful socialite Rose DeWitt is one the most touching relationships that I have ever seen in a movie.
B000024D4R|3.0|I think this album might be one Pink Floyd's darkest eras. It doesn't have the originality of Pre-dark side material, Doesn't reach the Nirvana attained in \\"Shine On You crazy diamond\\", and doesn't have the force present in \\"The Wall\\", or \\"Careful with that axe...\\".<br /><br />It has three extremely long tracks along with two extremely short ones. Unfortunately, the long tracks rely way too much on special effects and sound engineering and little on the music itself. But there is some good material:<br /><br />-The two short tracks.<br /><br />-Small bits of good guitar in \\"Dogs\\".<br /><br />-The really really good opening in \\"Sheep\\". It is a pity that after such a good opening the song goes horribly weird and melody-less. Just straight heavy metal, something way below a true Pink Floyd's fan lofty standards.
068987474X|4.0|The idea behind this book is great, and I've really enjoyed reading it.  It's good for a laugh and a sort of backhanded way of feeling good about yourself. <br /> <br />Although that backhanded method only went so far... It gets a little depressing once you realize that in all of your relationships and dating experiences, the man involved has never \\"been that into you.\\"  With so many excuses in the book, we wonder if anyone really will.
B000002U9W|4.0|Although the opening track, ATM, has been praised as a great fusion between classical music and rock, I think it is rather just a really weird jam with some bright moments. If you're looking for a good classical/rock fusion, look for Deep Purple's \\"Concerto for Group and Orchestra\\"(1969), recorded before ATM. And best among all classical/rock fusions, Deep Purple's \\"April\\", from their third album, also calles Deep Purple.<br /><br />About the other tracks: \\"Fat old sun\\" is when the Floyd started to find out what they wanted to do. And it shows you that Gilmour's guitar is Floyd's identity.<br /><br />\\"Alan's Psychedelic breakfast\\" deserve special attention. It compares to no other Floyd track. It takes you to a farm and really makes you smell the breakfast as it is being cooked. Really relaxing.<br /><br />The other tracks are not as good. It's a pity that Floyd didn't experiment any further with the classical/rock concept.
B00000K0T8|5.0|I always hear people reminiscing about how they miss the 36 Chambers sound. I really don't. I mean, the evolution that led to \\"Ironman\\". This was the start of what sound that would almost define \\"Wu Tang Forever\\", and god damn isn't it funny, hip hop in the last 2 years. No credit given, of course. If \\"Supreme Clientele\\" is pretty much the blueprint for all the b.s. that we're hearing how (of course, watered down with none of what made Supreme Clientele so good. I think it might be talent). \\"Ironman\\" would almost seem to be the blueprint for half the undergound hip-hop I've heard more than enough of lately.   I guess that means Ghostface pretty much beat the trend like, damn, this CD is 8 years old now?  If Amazon would allow the 7 words you can't say on TV, most of this review would be various versions of those saying how (...) good this CD is. Yeah, there are standout tracks, \\"Iron Maiden\\", \\"Winter Warz\\", \\"Camay\\", \\"Daytona 500\\", \\"After The Smoke is Clear\\"(the undisputed champ), but the whole CD is pretty much one solid track after another. The whole second half is flawless. So is whole CD really. Just get it.
B000002U8G|3.0|I'm a huge Floyd fan, but I find this album to be not really good. \\"One of these days\\" is a favorite of Hard rock lovers, but can scare the heck outta more symphonic-oriented Floyd fans.<br /><br />\\"Seamus\\" is a musical \\"joke\\" featuring a dog singing blues. Could have been further developed and made a bit longer. It was a very original idea.<br /><br />\\"Echoes\\" is the real reason for most people to buy this album. Yes, it is a very famous Floyd piece, and after you get used to the really weird noises it contains (that can easily scare most children) and after you hear it about 5 times in order to understand its structure and mood changes, it's really good. But it is not love at first sight. However, this studio performance is rather mellow and lacks a lot of the force present in the first live performance during the John Peel show (The best performance of Echoes). The second best performance of \\"Echoes\\"  was in the \\"Live at Pompeii\\" film. If you're planning to buy this CD just for Echoes, get the \\"Live At Pompeii\\" DVD instead of this CD.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|When I think of Christmas movies \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", \\"A Christmas Story\\" and \\"National Lampoons Christmas Vacation\\" have always been the first to come to mind. I can now add \\"Elf\\" to that list of timeless classics. Will Ferrell is at the top of his game in portraying a child-like elf. It really is too funny!<br /><br />  Elf is a truly original spin on Christmas. Think about it... that is hard to do... be original about Christmas! \\"Elf\\" succeeds in bringing us a very funny movie with some much needed Christmas spirit. Regardless of your holiday beliefs, \\"Elf\\" is a movie that everyone can enjoy!
B00005JMUL|3.0|I already went to see THE POLAR EXPRESS on 3D IMAX yesterday, and it was visually interesting and more than a little obnoxious. The 3D was fun, for it made it far more worthwhile than it would be otherwise. But I'm not the target audience for the film anyway, for I have little Christmas spirit and don't believe in Santa Claus. But, oh well.<br /><br />In addition to including all of the major plot points (both of them) from the Chris Van Allsburg book, the film has some pretty spectacular, downright frightening action sequences featuring creepy-looking animated children in constant states of peril.<br /><br />Those scenes, likely to scare the bejeezus out of smaller kids, are beautifully animated, and, on 3D, I found that it's really cool to watch a runaway train full of bright-eyed children almost collide with a mountain while skidding across a cracking lake of ice.<br /><br />The main girl character has braids that don't move. She almost gets killed three or four times, dangling from heights and what-not, but always gets saved because the train is \\"magic\\" and the North Pole is \\"magic.\\"<br /><br />The main boy character has weird eyes, and he's never given a name. For some reason, he keeps having conversations with a ghost of a hobo on the train - even though no one else acknowledges the ghost and the ghost has little to do with the story, other than communicating to the hero that \\"doubt is bad\\" or something.<br /><br />I think he's there just so Tom Hanks gets another character to voice, which seems greedy because he already provides the voice of dozens of characters - from the Conductor to Santa Claus.<br /><br />The music in this movie, by the way, is completely annoying. My friend and I had that song \\"Hot Chocolate\\" stuck in our head for seven hours after watching this.
B00006879E|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best album I've bought this year. \\"Songs About Jane\\" contains a great blend of R&B, Rock, Soul, Pop and even a little Jazz. Maroon 5 is extremely versatile. No two songs on this album sound alike.....and that is well appreciated here! The whole album is phenomenal! They're also good live as the last track is from a live performance. <br /> <br />AND there are no explicit lyrics (at least that I could notice, anyways).  <br /> <br />To sum it up: <br /> <br />AWESOME BAND <br />AWESOME ALBUM <br />AWESOME SOUND <br /> <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|I saw this in the cinema when it came out. Absolutely enthralling. <br />This film is extraordinarily well-crafted. Not done on a colossal budget, but it stands up to many films of the period VERY well ( compare this with HELL HOUSE , and you can see the difference in scare value, as well as the quality of this film). <br />In terms of content, the film has Priests in it who said that the various scenes most critics rail against as Blasphemous, are perfectly legitimate in context. <br />The really  chilling element that I have found bugs some people out , is that the Director uses some REAL  audio from an actual exorcism to beef up the presence of the demonic sounds. <br />If you are going to do a film on this genre, general topic area, then using the right material makes a big difference. This film does not make the mistake of making up its own \\"occult\\"  material like some recent films do. <br />This is a perpetual classic that shows just how a well made film will stand the test of time, small minded critics, and quality scripts ... however much the Director has to beef it up with cool ideas :-) <br />Great version .... also , get the 25th Anniversary  edition for some great , and insightful  extras. <br /> <br />
B000002HFU|5.0|In the passing of a true pioneer in hip hop, I'd just like to thank him for him livin out his dream and doing his own thing with no one holding him back. Return to the 36 Chambers is a great album that shows what ODB was really capible of...this crazy album doesn't hold Ol' Dirty back and he just lets loose giving a real colorful album. This album has always been considered one of the Wu Tang's best solo releases...and with good cause too. Although he wasn't the greatests emcee of all time, he was the greatest in his own field that has influenced and inspired other rappers who now follow in his foot steps. I just hope that he finished, if not completed most of his debut album for Rocafella so they can release that in the wake of Ol' Dirty's passing.  <br />RIP Russel Jones, hope you're havin a great time entertaining millions up in heaven cause you're still entertaining millions down here.
0790729628|3.0|First impressions are usually the most lasting.<br /><br />That said, I feel that the \\"Director's Cut\\" of BLADE RUNNER should have been packaged along with<br />the original \\"Theatrical\\" release only as a comparison offering to anyone really interested in seeing<br />how this film was intended to be viewed by the film maker.<br /><br />I first saw BLADE RUNNER on \\"The Movie Channel\\" back in the early 80's. To say that I was literally<br />blown away by this movie (as I was by THE ROAD WARRIOR and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK) is an<br />understatement! The dark presentations of our society/world in a not-so-distant future in these films<br />really hit home for me.<br /><br />Remember... this was the early period of the \\"Reagan Years\\". The \\"Cold War\\" was still a reality, \\"1984\\"<br />was just a stones throw away on the calander, the 21st Century still seemed far over the horrizon, and<br />respected scientists such as Carl Sagan constantly reminded us that \\"it is not inconceivable that we<br />could destroy ourselves... in a moment of unforgivable negelect... tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />Okay... back to the movie! LOL<br /><br />Why do I prefer the \\"theatrical\\" release over the \\"Director's Cut\\"? My answer is simple. BLADE RUNNER, as<br />originally released... just \\"feels correct\\". The voice-overs give the film that 1940's detective movie \\"feel\\".<br />The ending is one of HOPE... for humanity, the future, doing the \\"right\\" thing, and yes... for LOVE.<br />When I purchased the \\"Director's Cut\\" on VHS some years later (1993?), what I watched left me feeling<br />empty, cold, and most definitely feeling like SOMETHING was \\"missing\\"! I have watched this version twice,<br />to make sure my first impressions were not misplaced.<br /><br />So SORRY...<br /><br />but if this is what the makers of this film originally intended us to feel...<br /><br />then give me the \\"theatrical\\" offering...<br /><br />ANYtime!<br /><br />........................................................................<br /><br />UPDATE: 2008<br /><br />I recently purchased the \\"Four-Disk Collector's Edition\\" of BLADERUNNER.<br />And may I say it is simply worth EVERY penny!!!

0140277447|3.0|I don't think this is a place where we should be discussing the Japanese responsibility for the Nanjing Incident (we should be talking about the book, folks!), but there seem to be some factual confusion so please allow me to make a couple of important ones clear here. Some reviewers are saying that Japan has not accepted the fact of the Nanjing Incident. But what do you mean by accepting? All Japanese government-approved history-textbooks today clearly state that the Japanese troops brutally killed a great number of Chinese civilians, including women and children, at Nanjing in 1937, and also that the Japanese government didn't report the incident to the Japanese people at that time. Aside from the disagreements about details (the number killed, etc.), the Nanjing Incident itself is an established, well-known (oh yes!) historical fact in Japan. Some of those textbooks even state that China is claiming the killed to be 30,000. The Nanjing Incident IS one of the most horrible moments of Japanese history in our consciousness. Did you know that?     Has the Japanese government formally apologized to China for the Incident? No it hasn't. But this is, as you should know, a complicated political issue. I myself think that Japan should just make a formal apology. But Japan has not done so yet for several political reasons. First of all, it is not the modern international custom to make formal apologies about war. Germany did apologize for the holocaust, but they did not apologize for the war itself. In the modern international laws, the defeated nations pay indemnity. Japan of course paid the indemnity set by the Allies and by the bilateral agreements between China and Japan, not to mention the tens of billions of dollars Japan has paid to China as ODA and other economic assistance since then.    Moreover, the formal apology for the Nanjing Incident (which happened 67 years ago) wasn't even an issue between China and Japan for long time. It was Japanese (Katsuichi Honda, etc.), not Chinese, who dug up this then-not-well-researched historical incident and started debating about it after the war, leading to more research work after another and creating a big genre of historical research in Japan. It was a Japanese (Saburo Ienaga) who sued the Japanese government for the suppressed description of the Nanjing Incident in the history textbooks (and won). It was these Japanese activities that got China notice the Nanjing Incident for the political use. Before that, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping even acknowledged a certain merit the Japanese military power in Asia had for their country during the war. (I'm not saying that this is the common sentiment in Japan but that even Chinese leaders used to say such things.) It is only since Jiang Zemin that China has started bringing up the issue of \\"formal apology\\" as a diplomatic card.    To repeat myself, although the historiography of the Nanjing Incident is pretty complicated, Japan has never denied that the killing took place, never since the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Japan is a free country, so there can always be some deniers who make controversial arguments (those recent Japanese \\"revisionists\\" have their counterparts in Germany and elsewhere in the world), but those extremists don't represent Japan as a whole. (\\"Sintaro Ishihara, the most popular contemporary writer in Japan\\"? Come on. He's an old-time mediocre novelist turned nut-head right-wing politician.)    One sentence about the Chang's book: I think she is a good story teller, but not a good historian. Period.    If you are really interested in the objective truth at all, it goes without saying that you should at least check out the findings and arguments from other perspectives too. But those of you who keep calling us \\"Jap\\" and just say \\"this is the truth!\\" don't seem to have taken the necessary trouble to educate yourselves with the available literature (I can't even tell if those \\"this is simply the truth!\\"people have really read the Chang's book either). It is so dangerous if we do not calmly and objectively collect the empirical data and analyze them to learn from history. If you really respect those Nanjing victims, it is our responsibility to find out the real complexity of their lives and deaths.    Finally, if you think Japan has a \\"squeaky clean image,\\" that's your problem and not ours. We hell know our country is full of bullsh**. :-(
B00005JMUL|5.0|I watched `The Polar Express' yesterday with some of my friends and we all agreed that it was the best Christmas movie we had seen in a long time! This is a movie that anyone from any age group can watch and enjoy. <br /> <br />The story revolves around a young boy who has nearly lost his faith in Santa Claus and the spirit of Christmas. On Christmas Eve, he wakes up at night to find a train, called `The Polar Express' outside his home. The Conductor welcomes him and invites him to go to the North Pole. Although he is still skeptic about the whole trip, he nevertheless enters The Polar Express, and as a result, goes on an unforgettable journey filled with magic and excitement.  <br /> <br />I found this movie to be perfect in every way. The animation, to start with, is incredible! The characters seem so life-like, along with the breathtaking scenery that you feel that you are watching a real movie, not an animated one. An immediate scene that comes to my mind is when the train accelerates towards Glacier Gulch, and the conductor, along with the 2 kids, are taken into an unbelievable roller-coaster ride, which made me hold on to my seat as well.  Of course the talents of Tom Hanks add tremendously to the film. He provides the voices for the Boy, the Conductor, the Hobo and Santa Claus so skillfully that he brings the magic of the characters to the screen. Moreover, the background score adds perfectly to the movie throughout including songs such as `When Christmas comes to Town'. <br /> <br />This movie will make you laugh, gasp, feel excited and in the end, leave you with a nice warm feeling inside. If you watch this movie, this holiday season, you will believe!

B00005ALP6|1.0|My Fair Lady, an award winning movie, for its great musical performances, and its \\"impressive\\" acting. This musical, an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, is said to be one of the greatest movies of its time. After reading the original play by Shaw, I can say that this movie is one of the worst adaptations from a book to the big screen. You see, Pygmalion is a play based on Shaw's cynical satire, by making fun of the social class difference, and using comical ideas such as the \\"undeserving poor,\\" he creates a masterpiece that is worth passing on from generation to generation. My Fair Lady degrades what Shaw took so long to build, from his first edition of Pygmalion to the last; this movie destroys the essence of the cynicism and satirical content.  <br /> <br />One of the ways that Shaw's satire is destroyed is the fact that My Fair Lady is a musical. Musicals usually involve jolly tunes and sad tunes, but not really allowing any room for cynicism. From what I have learned about Shaw, he does not seem like the person who would enjoy one of his plays to be morphed into some dandy musical, especially if it does not respect the essence of what Pygmalion represents. <br /> <br />Even though this movie does not represent Shaw's satire in Pygmalion, it does try to keep some aspects of the original play. We find that in the script of My Fair Lady, there are still lines from Pygmalion, which is a failed attempt to preserve the play's originality.  <br /> <br />Hollywood is known for inventing stories, just as they did in My Fair Lady. By adding things to make the movie more appealing to what the movie audience wants, the story loses its essence. In My Fair Lady there are parts that never appear in the play, for example, when Eliza goes to the horse races, this never happens in the book, Eliza goes to Mrs. Higgins' house, where she is tested. With this added scene, the book is changed even if the same thing happens in both places. The way that Hollywood changes Pygmalion in an abrupt way, is the ending of the movie. Eliza ends up together with Higgins, which is something that is left unclear in the book, if anything Eliza ends up with Freddy in Pygmalion.  <br /> <br />We can see that My Fair Lady is an inadequate adaptation of G.B. Shaw's masterpiece, Pygmalion. By allowing Hollywood to warp the essence of Shaw's cynical satire, the meaning of the word adaptation was destroyed. My Fair Lady, is one of the worst musicals to be made. <br />

B0002MB7QW|1.0|I have to say the CGI are great but the storyline is baaaaaaad. This movie includes all the stereotypes and clichs of a disaster movie and that makes it so previsible: The teens who, of course, will fall for one another at the end of the movie. The separated couple who, of course, will make things up. The father and son who barely know each other who, of course by the end, will have the strongest bond ever. The guy who will sacrifice his live for his friend... Hopefully, I'm not going to list them all here. Bad. Bad. Bad. The idea of using the global warming as a start was a good one in my opinion but the storyline and the actors are really bad.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time, and the DVD was certainly worth the wait. I have been an Ed Wood fan since reading \\"The Golden Turkey Awards\\" by Harry and Michael Medved many years ago. In the Medved book, Ed Wood not only was named the \\"Worst Director of All Time,\\" but his masterwork, \\"Plan Nine From Outer Space\\" won \\"Worst Movie of All Time.\\" That is high praise indeed, but I think the reason Ed won was because of his naive commitment to his work. A lot of directors have made a lot of worse movies than Ed did (many with astronomically larger budgets), but the devoted earnestness of Wood's films truly set them apart.<br /><br />In this film, shot in perfectly suited black and white, Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood in the greatest performance of his career. Depp shines as the eccentric director, and truly brings the character to life in a way that genuinely makes the audience like and appreciate Ed. The other towering figure in the movie is that of Martin Landau (who deservedly won an Oscar for this performance) as Ed's friend Bela Lugosi, the great man of gothic horror films. Landau is mesmerizing as Lugosi, and people familiar with Wood's films will be amazed by the uncanny accuracy of his performance. Through the relationship of these two men, the audience really comes to appreciate Wood's fundamental humanity. I can't say enough about Landau's performance. Rarely has there ever been another biopic performance as accurate or powerful.<br /><br />The film traces Ed's film career from his personal statement about angora in \\"Glen or Glenda,\\" through the \\"Bride of the Monster\\" debacle (the scene of Bela flailng with the unmotorized octopus alone is worth the price of the DVD), and finally to his opus, the film for which he will always be remembered, \\"Plan Nine From Outer Space.\\" The sets throughout the film are absolutely perfect, and the interesting thing is how Director Tim Burton made the \\"Wood\\" sets look perfectly shoddy, without making them into a parody. The lighting and makeup are also perfect (Rick Baker also won an Oscar for makeup) and greatly enhance the period feel of the film.<br /><br />Tim Burton will always have a special place in my heart for thoughtfully casting original Wood regulars Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks and Gregory Walcott in small roles. That was a greatly appreciated and gentlemanly touch.<br /><br />The DVD was definitely worth the wait. There are several \\"making of\\" features (one featuring Johnny Depp in drag in a meat packing plant), the original trailer, commentary from several principals of the film, and a delightful (and extremely strange) music video, directed by, of all people, Toni Basil.<br /><br />This is a great movie, and from what I have read about Wood, is generally quite accurate. The entire supporting cast is fabulous (particularly Bill Murray), and they truly manage to capture the essence of the Ed Wood experience. This is suitable for all audiences except young children. There are some language issues, and some issues of confused sexuality (crossdressing; angora fetish) that are not suitable for pre-teens.<br /><br />Ed Wood finally got the recognition he deserved; I only wish he were around to enjoy it. He died in poverty in 1978. I recommend this film without any reservations. Thank you, Tim Burton.rody.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|In 1983, theater audiences were treated to the outrageous comedy \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\" featuring the fictional Griswold family thanks to the superb writing by John Hughes and direction by Harold Ramis.  In that film, the head of the Griswold household, Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Jr. (Chevy Chase), is determined to take his family on the best vacation ever by driving them from their home in the Chicago suburbs to the fictional amusement theme park in California known as Wally World.  However, things don't quite go the way that Clark had intended along the way.  Two years later, the Griswolds returned to the big screen in the rather disappointing \\"National Lampoon's European Vacation\\", which was directed by Amy Heckerling and co-written by John Hughes and Robert Klane.  Four years later (1989), under the direction of Jeremiah S. Chechik and solely written by John Hughes, the return of the Griswold family in \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" was again as funny and well-written as their original 1983 film. <br /> <br />Similar to the original \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\", in \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" Clark Griswold is determined that his family will have a traditional Christmas celebration at their home in the Chicago suburbs and invites his parents and his in-laws.  Clark's wife, Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo, who was also in the previous two films), does not share his obsessive enthusiasm, but goes along with him, including making a trip to the mountains to chop down their own Christmas tree.  Accompanied by their children, Audrey (Juliette Lewis) and Rusty (Johnny Galecki), to the mountains, the trip is hilarious as it doesn't go quite the way that Clark planned.  For outdoor decorations, Clark uses a ridiculous 25,000 lights to transform the Griswold home into what he thinks is the ideal Christmas setting.  Then, unexpectedly and uninvited, good ol' Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid, who was also in the original film) shows up with his peculiarfamily in their broken-down RV, which he parks in front of Clark's home.  More laughs ensue when Clark's parents, Clark Wilhelm Griswold, Sr. (John Randolph, 1915-2004) and Nora Griswold (Diane Ladd), and his in-laws, Art (E.G. Marshall) and Frances (Doris Roberts, better-known for her portrayal of Marie Barone in the TV sitcom \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\", 1996-2005), arrive, as well as the cigar-smoking Uncle Lewis (William Hickey, 1928-1997) and Aunt Bethany (1908-1998).  With an electric-cord-chewing cat, a flaming Christmas tree, a disappointing Christmas bonus, family fighting and a SWAT team, \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" is sure to make you laugh and encourage you to plan your own traditional, old-fashioned family Christmas celebration. <br /> <br />Other memorable characters in \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" include Cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn, who was in the original film), Cousin Rocky (Cody Burger), Cousin Ruby Sue (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), neighbor Todd Chester (Nicholas Guest), his wife Margo Chester (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Bill (Sam McMurray), Mary (Nicolette Scorsese), Clark's boss Mr. Frank Shirley (Brian Doyle-Murray, who played the Kamp Komfort manager in the original film) and his wife Mrs. Helen Shirley (Natalia Nogulich).  Overall, I rate \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.
0140277447|5.0|It's a must read. I was totally outraged by Japanese behavior, not only in WWII, but also now.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|For years, I've wondered when Alan Parsons would go this route.

B00005ALP6|4.0|The film \\"My Fair Lady\\",  being an adaptation of the play Pygmalion by G.B Shaw, destroys the complete satire that is presented in the play by Shaw's cynical interpretations. Shaw's persistent and comical sincerity humanizes the social class difference, marriage, and various themes which are presented throughout the play and brings comedy and drama to a more \\"real\\" level. The film \\"My Fair Lady\\" was nominated as the best musical of the year in 1964, presenting the best duplicate of the play Pygmalion. This film did not exactly adapt to the original play of Shaw's Pygmalion, because it cracked the satire presented in the play which gave it originality and excellence. I believe that the whole satire was destroyed because of the musical part, in which the feelings and expressions showed were controversial from the real play. The whole point of the satire and the exaggerated humor and ridicule was constructed to show the myth of Pygmalion, and disappeared due to the whole concept of the movie. <br /> <br />The Pygmalion representation of society was taken by this musical and changed the themes presented in the play. I'm not saying that the movie does not try to keep some specific lines from the play, and tries in a way to perform the original script throughout the film, but the musical fails to do this consistently. The switching of the themes in the film portrays another feeling than that Pygmalion. The character interpretations that appear in the movie are different to those that appear in the original play which exemplify the contrast between the undeserving and deserving poor. The relationship between Higgins and the flower girl, Eliza, were presented by Higgins as an understandable man while in the play he was the most close minded, rude and detestable man. Eliza, the flower girl, acted by Audrey Hepburn was a beautiful woman whose performance was great in showing real emotions, like her attitude and her way of speaking, but lost all the original emotions when themusical part appeared. Eliza's affection towards Higgins was showed during a musical solo that the flower girl performed. Her facial expressions of happiness were so evident, that it made it very different from the play, where her emotions were mainly stated by words and not physical expressions. The singing was not actually done by the actress, but by Marni Nixon. The performances were not as excellent as what I expected them to be. The characters did not portray the real characteristics of the original play of Pygmalion. The emotions were so enhanced that it made the film a ridiculous duplicate of the play. The satire and cynicism presented by Shaw was swept away throughout the whole firm. <br /> <br />The ending differed in both the play and in the movie which change the whole theme that Eliza presented. In the play the ending is very ironic or almost sarcastic using a humorous exaggeration of a typical happy ending story where Eliza got married and ran a flower shop missing her days with Higgins who helped her become the women that she was. In the film we can see that it ended by Eliza staying at Higgins house. To conclude, I believe that \\"My Fair lady\\" was not even close to a good adaptation of the play Pygmalion because it destructed the whole satire that truly represented the myth of Pygmalion. <br />
0553801503|5.0|I have yet to find any series from the Fantasy genre that even comes close to rivaling \\"A Song of Ice and Fire.\\" The way in which Martin describes his characters and the plots that develop with them is utterly amazing. I am sure anyone that has read the series has their favorites, mine would definitely have to be Daenerys, Jon, and Tyrion. I very much enjoy how he is not afraid to cut off main characters, it really adds something to the series, anyone that has a chance should definitely pick up a copy of the first three and the fourth as soon as it comes out.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I tell you, it doesn't get any better than this Broadway Musical Soundtrack. Amazing talent, wonderful songs, and a slew of recognizable faces. Idina Menzel shines as the \\"Wicked Witch\\", Elphaba. She brings a depth and charm to the bumbling character that many actresses wouldn't have been able to acheive. Her beautiful voice and amazing belting talent make her a wonderful talent. Kristen Chenoweth is outstanding as G(a)linda, the Good Witch. Her little girl voice is lovable and charming, and her operatic vibrato is beautiful.  <br /> <br />I recommend this CD above all others! If you love Broadway (or even if you don't!), you will love WICKED!
B00005MAM2|4.0|I read the epic manga of Akira first and got this for my birthday. For being an adaptation (even if it was done by the creater), I felt even with the changed parts from the manga, this was good. The dub, like most will agree, sucked; Japanese audio with English Subs is the best to go with most anime (unless it's Inu Yasha, both aren't that good but the Japanese sounds like he has a headcold).  <br /> <br />For a synopsis, Old Tokyo is destroyed in 1988 (when the movie came out) and another World War begins with the Soviets and Americans going head-to-head (which we don't see). Tokyo is rebuilt over thirty years in Tokyo Bay on a manmade island where the movie starts (2019). The government is hated in this movie and we'll see anti-governmental members everywhere (including riots and terrorist bombings). Kaneda is the leader of a biker gang which goes around causing mayhem in the streets while fighting their nemesis gang, The Jokers. During their battle, Tetsuo (a friend of Kaneda who is put down often by him) is injuried when a small man walks out onto the road while his bike is driving by. The bike explodes and Tetsuo is taken by military medics to a hospital. Kaneda meets Kei, a member of an anti-government group, at a police questioning. Tetsuo is revealed to be a telekenetic and quickly gains power, seeking the mysterious Akira (who in the manga was actually a boy). During a raid, Kaneda and Kei meet Tetsuo with his new powers, seeing he's turned evil with his newfound powers. After a long and explosive track, Tetsuo reaches Akira to find him dead, only jars of organs (that ticked me off a little, I liked the little boy Akira). Several other psychics revive Akira to suck Tetsuo into another reality where a new universe is born and destroyed, consuming Tetsuo into it. <br /> <br />Changes from the Manga: Otumo takes out all of manga 3, which requires Akira to become a bunch of organs becuase at the end of Number 2, he destroys Neo Tokyo. This destruction and lackof government creates a load of clans and territories, the most known is The Japanese Empire, lead by Emperor Akira. I felt that Manga #3 was needed becuase Kaneda comes into the story as a chauvanist, cursing, antisocial, arrogant, egotistical biker but leaves less chauvanist (at least in my eyes) becuase he develops a romance with Kei, a real tomboy who seems to change his views on girls. In the anime, they only hint at a romance (mostly one sided with Kaneda making really bad pick-up lines or starting conversations that are less-than casual) and Kaneda leaves the same chauvanist, cursing, antisocial, arrogant, egotistical biker he started out as. <br /> <br />Overall-I think the dub and differences in the storyline were a disappointment but the overall movie was great, especially the dub-synch in Japanese (the mouths ACTUALLY move with the words!). Four stars!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Some bands claim to be progressive because they are backed by a symphony or they add keyboards to the music. True progressive music is music that pushes beyond the limits of its time, writing and production that is so unique and fresh that it becomes a breath of fresh air each time you hear it. Like you've just woke from a comma and entered a new life. Such is Opeth and the release of Deliverance/Damnation. Each new release shows a new layer of growth and pioneering sounds that only now are becoming the mainstream. Although mainstream now, history sees what The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Brian Wilson did to reinvent music for their genre,Opeth is now doing with metal.
1592400876|4.0|It's rather amazing that a book on punctuation can be written so extensively and at the same time, provide much comic relief. Through this book, you'll realize that despite having been well-schooled, there are so many punctuation mistakes that we commit without even realizing the gravity of the errors. More often than not, the incorrect placement or omission of these nitty gritty symbols can lead to miscommunication and the result is often diasastrous and comical.<br /><br />Lynne Truss presents the different punctuation marks in different chapters which include illustrations of wrong usage, explanations of the history and evolution of the punctuations and of course, the correct usage. The coverage is rather comprehensive, if not all encompassing.<br /><br />I encourage anyone to give it a read. All schools should stock a few of these and teachers can use the book as an instructional guide without being being a bore.
B0002YLC24|4.0|This review contans ***SPOILERS***&#60; so don't read if you haven't seen the film.  As &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; is one of my favorite films, I was thrilled to see &#34;Before Sunset&#34; when it came out on DVD last week.  Although I loved the movie, and I see it as a realistic &#34;sequel&#34; to Before Sunrise, I don't see it as an optimistic ending as everyone else seems to.  During the movie, I felt that there was a diconnect beween Celine and Jessie that would not have been cured by a few hours of conversation.  I felt that time had made the characters so different than they were during the first movie, that the only thing that they now had in common was the dissapointment that they shared in not being together all these years...and the resulting gaps in their love lives.  While most seem to find the scene where they are traveling up the stairs to Celine's apartment as some sort of positive event, I see it as they have said all that there is to say to each other.  Its an uncomfortable silence.  And it is one of the only times during the 2 movies where the characters walk but don't talk to each other.  Also, even at the end, when Celine dances for Jessie and tells him that he is going to miss the plane, it feels to me like he is trying to get rid of him, like she is not comfortable with him being there.  Note that the characters do not touch each other throughout the movie.  Finally, in the end, I see it as unralistic that Jessie will simply stay in Paris with Celine, and give up his son, who he says is the most important thing to him.  I'd love to be the romantic, but it is simply not realistic.  Having said all of this, watch the 2 movies back to back.  The physical appearance of the 2 actors, and the difference in the conversation will strike you.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Holiday movies seem to me to almost be a wasted effort.  A film that only appeals one month of the year.  \\"Elf\\" is different.  It has that magic that \\"Christmas Vacation\\" has.  A film that I will watch every holiday season.  It will be timeless and never get old.  It is charming and fun for the whole family,  It is cleverly written, tightly directed, and slick production values.  Will Farrell is in top form in the title role.  Director Jon Favreau show his comic timing in his direction and moves the film at a quick and happy pace.  Sit back, drink eggnog and leave Santa some cookies.
B000002JS6|4.0|First off, I am not a die-hard AC/DC fan, I enjoy them and I own three albums (Back in Black, Highway to Hell and The Razor's Edge), and the only thing that keeps AC/DC from cracking even my top 5 favorite rock bands ever is that their songs are too repetitive. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes I feel like some of their songs are just the same thing over and over again. The reperitive things are good, but it'd be nice for a change.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is a Miles Davis Masterpiece!   A superb collection of songs, filled with   powerful expressions and a smooth flow.    Paul Chambers-- Bass  Jimmy Cobb-- Drums  John Coltrane-- Tenor Saxophone  Cannonball Adderley-- Alto Saxophone  Wynton Kelly/Bill Evans-- Piano    Blue In Green is my favorite song from the album.  It's a gentle & hypnotic piece that   I never get sick of hearing!    Miles Davis plays his trumpet as though he's reciting   a beautiful poem through it.
B000002KET|5.0|This is a truely incredible album. Black Sabbath's trademark \\"sludgey\\" style of guitar and slow, but still head-banging tunes keep you into it the whole album. However, I must warn anyone, skip Fluff (Track 3), it doesn't pick up in the whole 4 minutes and 10 seconds of the song, just a boring acoustic guitar. But anyway, this album has great song after great song.

B000059GEH|5.0|HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was made in the \\"innocent\\" years before movies became cheap and sensationalized.  If it were made today, well, I'd hate to think how it would be made.  Nothing and no one could beat the three stars of yersteryear.  Marilyn, Betty and Lauran were one of a kind and each has a great scene of their own.  Together they are really delightful. It's a shame they didn't share more scenes.  The Fox look in those days was well...quite wonderful as well as a nice background score.  Does the picture hold up today.  Yes, but barely.  It's just too innocent and clean fun.  That's not for todays audiences.  Thank God we have DVD.  These memories down nostalgia can last forever.  The DVD is clear and sharp with nice stereo sound.  Too bad the extras weren't better.  Someone should have given a commentary.  Miss Bacall would have been an excellent choice.  Would have been nice to hear how the filming went, how certain shots were established and what scenes were cut from the final print.  I think she's the lone survivor who had anything to do with the film, at least as of this date.  This is a must see for Marilyn fans as this is my second favorites of her films.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|If you are reading this, you must like or have liked Marillion's music at some point or another. Allow me to confirm that with this cd, they have returned in force with songs that most fans should adore. Marbles should have come out after Afraid of Sun light. Marbles is a jewel. Despite the fact that there are a couple commercial songs that are nevertheless suprisingly pleasant or even good, the cd has some strong progressive moments in, The Invisible man - sounds at times a little bit like Genesis' Wathchers of the skies, Ocean Cloud, Neverland, amongst others. The cd is a must. However, the double cd version from the band's website is well worth a few dollars more. You get more than 30 minutes of music, all of which is tremendous, giving the cd a tone of excellence.  Go to amazon.com for several descriptive reviews to help you decide. Enjoy!
B00005JNEI|3.0|I enjoyed all the well deserved Bush bashing, but this is hardly a documentory. That's fine, but while it offers a different perspective on the war people are too quick to say \\"this is the truth!\\". How can you possibly discuss foreign policies in the middle east without mentioning Israel and its ties with the US ?? The fact is that Michael wasn't so much concerned with the truth, but more so with defeating Bush. Any negative comment on Israel would have worked against this goal. Sad, but true.
0634060384|5.0|This \\"sixth edition\\" is a welcome sight. At this price it's more affordable to musicians, and you don't need to feel like you're buying some pot from the music store by asking for it in hushed tones. <br /> <br />The differences between this and the bootleg fifth edition Real Book are substantial - many tunes are incompatable between the two, so you cannot mix the books as you could with older editions of the Real Book. But as this new one contains the correct changes and forms (including those notorious missing 4 bars in Desafinado, the correct changes for Dolphin Dance, and the omission of the mystery \\"turnaround\\" we've long ignored in the 4th bar of the bridge of Satin Doll) it's really a better book for new players, and will be enlightening to say the least for veteran players who've been playing these songs wrong all these years. <br /> <br />Not all the songs are here: some, like the Zappa and Sun Ra tunes, obviously were not cleared by the copyright owners; others which never are really played are omitted as well, like \\"Perfect Love\\". What replaces them are tunes which are far more useful to the gigging player, classic standards and others which were never in the Real Book but should have been. An internet search will easily turn up the tune list - if you absolutely need the tunes not in there anymore, you're out of luck unless you keep your old copy too. <br /> <br />I don't think the transposed versions are available at this writing. Of course, if you can transpose that's no bother at all. Hopefully they will be out soon. Once they are, this can truly replace the illegal book at about half the cost and with more useful tunes for the player.
B00009W0U4|3.0|I was feeling sick from the camera spinning and droning noises, while guiltily enjoying the anticipation and excitement of the extreme sex and violence that made me rent this, when I started enjoying how smart and philosophical the movie is, which is when I began to despise its manipulative and fake picture of the world. <br /> <br />It goes in segments back through time like Memento, with a similarly sadistic plot but more so. The three characters and their relationship are richly developed in a way that tells an interesting story, which feels 'profound' (and the framing of the movie emphasize its 'philosophical' quality). Its formal film-making heavy-handedly illustrates the regression through time from chaos (the camera and sound in the beginning are hard to endure) to pastoral, such that you see the seeds of chaos in the pastoral: the lovers in the hedonism of their happiness and the ex-boyfriend, a professor of some kind, in the way his 'philosophy' gives free rein to the masochism (and with it sadism) of his clinging to the lovers. The long takes are great, and are edited together digitally so that the whole movie seems to be one take, which isn't as great because it requires the camera twirling around into the sky a lot. <br /> <br />But when I think about it it occurs to me that neither people nor Paris is as chaotic as the movie wants to make a philosophical point of -- people follow lines of conversation and desire self-indulgently, but even on drugs or under great stress not as aggressively for as long as in the movie -- I doubt any parties are quite as hedonistic as that one, nor are there S & M clubs as alienating as that one nor any named 'Rectum' -- and pimps on their own street corner don't, I think, attack random women in sidewalk underpasses, rape them at great length and beat them into a coma. To make those the premises for philosophy is wrong.  <br />
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is by far the best album to ever come out of that controversial rapper we know as Eminem. You may think that I'm a little biased though since I really enjoyed his debut, The Slim Shady LP. But Em showed a different side to himself on that album. The side that he shows on The Marshall Mathers LP, however, strikes me as the best. It is a darker, and way more mature version of Eminem than he has, even until now, ever shown. The lyrics are that of a genius, the melodies hypnotic and even the order of the songs and the way they are presented makes this album a masterpiece, not just of rap, but for all music. Even if you do not like rap music, or are just now getting to know Eminem, listen to this album. It's one of the few albums that I can listen to straight through, without skipping any tracks.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|After a few listens alot of the stuff on here does get repetitive and boring.The guitars and the overall musicianship all kick major rock n roll booty and beats all the other junk out their these days,but I mean if you listen to alotta classic rock like me,then you would know a thing or 2 about the necessity of variety.On this album you have your straight ahead rockers and your slow ballad like prog-rock tunes.The fast tunes all pretty much offer the same vibe and feeling.Ballads like \\"Timothy\\" and \\"Move on\\" have that beatles/oasis like sound and are worth a listen.But once again,nothing really distinguishes them from each other.The lyrics are pretty sub-par and the overall songwriting could use a bit more originality.The album overall stands well on it's own and is a breath of fresh air from everything else out there today.But compared to Jet's contemporaries(Silvertide,The Darkness,White Stripes,etc),it wouldn't hurt for these guys to kick it up a notch in their lyrics and overall variety in the songwriting. <br /> <br /> <br />Don't let all the obvious comparisons of Jet to the  Beatles/Stones/Who/etc turn you off from this band.Look at Aerosmith when they came out back in 73.They were called a bunch of drugged-up Stones wannabees.Van Halen was called America's answer to Led Zeppelin with just a bit more of a sense of humor and raunchyness.Fast forward to today,A'smith and VH to this day are legends of hard rock.Only time will tell is these guys are a fluke or sign of good things to come.
B0000012XC|5.0|This boxed set was released to celebrate Wilhelm Kempff's 100th birthday, and it is simply gorgeous.  It consists of the complete piano sonatas recorded in 1951-56 (in very good quality mono) by one of the supreme interpreters of Beethoven.<br />Listen to the first movement of the &quot;Pathetique&quot; and you feel transported to the 1950s, with all of the nostalgia that characterizes memories of the post-war Germany.  On the third movement of the &quot;Moonlight&quot; sonata, you hear Kempff at his peak.  Of all the versions I have heard, including Kempff's stereo recording, this must be the most energetic and exciting one.<br />The packaging is tasteful and sobre, and contains several pictures of the musician.  This set comes with a booklet and bonus CD of Kempff expressing himself on various topics, ranging from Hiroshima to his interpretation of Beethoven's music.  I wish all of Deutsche Grammophon's Collector's sets were as well documented and nicely packaged as this Dokumente boxed set.<br />This is a piece of history and a definite must have for any classical music listener.  I recommend you buy this boxed set in conjunction with a more modern interpretation, for example Ashkenazy's cycle on Decca or Brendel's digital set on Philips.  However, if you could get only one set, you'd be hard pressed to find a better cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas than this one.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Sadly I just don't get it. Every song sounds the same. To be honest this album is just all too predictable, boring and ...yes plain dull. Original you are joking. A bit of Radiohead a lot of Suede and a large dose of post punk Brit Pop thrash.  Listening to this truly was painful. Inane lyrics and a screeching sound to put your teeth on edge. To me yet another case of hype overpowering any sense of musical judgement. Everyone to their own I guess. I haven't seen them live and that's the acid test.  Perhaps I am getting old and cynical but I think a decent tune or melody is a useful ingredient in a song!! Nope, I just don't get it.
B000669GAI|5.0|For a period of three years (1992-95), Pearl Jam was the biggest rock band in the world.  Nowadays, their albums have trouble breaking the 500,000 sales mark (\\"Ten\\" sold over nine million).  This was more because of a shift in mainstream tastes than any degradation in the band's quality of music.  It's true that Pearl Jam largely abandoned the power rock that made them rock demi-gods and MTV darlings, but they continued to make great music.  Of their four post-\\"Vitalogy\\" albums, I give all but one a solid recommendation (the exception being the muddled \\"Binaural\\").  Rather, it was that the average American person stopped listening to great music, in favor of whatever MTV told them was cool.  Just look at last week's Billboard Top 200 albums, and tell me how many of those bands will be remembered fondly in ten years.  \\"Rearviewmirror\\" chronicles Pearl Jam's journey from superstars to a beloved cult band largely in the way that last year's \\"Lost Dogs\\" did, but unlike \\"Lost Dogs\\" it mostly covers their radio hits. <br /> <br />Because \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is supposed to be a \\"Greatest Hits\\" and not \\"Best of\\", I have little complaints about the track listing.  Every single one of these songs is great, and worthy of inclusion; most of them you've heard on the radio before.  I was going to type a list of my favorite tracks on the album, but it would simply be too difficult to do.  I will say that I'm delighted at the addition of such oddball choices as \\"Rearviewmirror\\", \\"Breath\\", and \\"Nothingman\\" (none of those were very big hits, except with Pearl Jam's hardcore base).  It shows that even on their \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, Pearl Jam could not help but include some odd choices.  I have some minor complaints- I don't like how both discs are in chronological order (exempting \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\", of course), and I think \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" are virtually ignored.  However, once again, these are supposed to be their greatest hits and not a definitive best-of collection.  I thinkit's awesome that Pearl Jam divides the album into a heavy disc and a soft one, much like they did with \\"Lost Dogs\\". <br /> <br />\\"Rearviewmirror\\" is a perfect album to buy for new Pearl Jam fans (they're probably not that many of them).  If you're a hardcore one like myself, you probably own most of these tracks, so the only reason to buy this album would be to add to your collection.  However, this is an awesome history of one of the world's greatest bands.  If anyone out there thinks that mainstream music sucks today, they should give their old reliable favorites another spin.
B0000CD5FN|4.0|I did not pay too much attention to this record when it came out for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1. I never was able to get very excited about the world-beat focus of the two previous Mescaleros records.<br /><br />2. I had read that this posthumous release was not quite finished when Joe died so a couple of his key collaborators went into the studio and augmented the existing recordings to finish it off. It has been my experience that \\"From the grave\\" releases are usually little better than half-finished demo tapes.<br /><br />Last week, an acquaintance told me this was an excellent record and urged me to get it ASAP. I am glad I did. In my opinion, this is by far the best thing anybody from the Clash has done since Combat Rock and is easily Joe Strummer's best solo record. Coma Girl and Get Down Moses stand up against anything on Sandinista or London Calling but the whole album is terrific.<br /><br />Now I wish they would release a live album from Joe and the Mescaleros with all those cool Clash covers they mixed into their set.

B0006284JQ|5.0|A lot of critics say that Britney has no real talent, that she's trash, etc.  This CD proves them wrong....if you actually listen to the songs, you will see that Britney CAN sing.   <br /> <br />MY PREROGATIVE: A great way to kick off the album, this song is HOT.  It's much better than Bobby Brown's original version.  The chorus alone makes it worth listening to. <br /> <br />TOXIC: This song's very unique and different, and I love it!  Britney sounds terrific during the chorus. <br /> <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U: This is the song that began Britney's transformation from sweet schoolgirl to sexy diva.  The beats are hot, and Britney's voice sounds smooth and seductive. <br /> <br />OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN: Britney's best song, hands down.  It's perfect: the lyrics, the music, Britney's vocals.... <br /> <br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC: This song may take some time to grow on you.  I didn't like it much when I first heard it, but it IS a good song.  It would be better if Madonna wasn't in it though. <br /> <br />STRONGER: After \\"Oops!,\\" this is my favorite Britney track.  Britney's voice is amazing here. <br /> <br />EVERYTIME: A moving, stark ballad.  Britney wrote the lyrics and melody....it's a true step forward musically for her. <br /> <br />...BABY ONE MORE TIME: The song that started it all.  Surprisingly, it still holds up six years later and sounds just as good now as it did then. <br /> <br />(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY: Another hot song.  Britney took the original version and added different vocals and had it remixed.   <br /> <br />BOYS (THE CO-ED MIX): I love the original album edit, but this version is missing something.  Plus, Pharrell's vocals are annoying. <br /> <br />SOMETIMES: Beautiful, mid-tempo song.  It may be a bit corny at times, but Britney sings it well and it's just a good song in general. <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED (DARKCHILD REMIX): For some reason, this song doesn't do it for me.  Britney's vocals are nicely done and the beat's decent, but the album version is better. <br /> <br />LUCKY: The lyrics seem to mirror Britney's life and it's almost sad in a way.  If anyone other than Britney had recorded it, it probably would've been cheesy. <br /> <br />OUTRAGEOUS: My least-favorite song on this CD.  There's really no substance to it...it almost seems like the entire song is just the chorus on repeat.   <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN: I LOVE this song.  Britney's voice sounds beautiful.  Very nice song. <br /> <br />I'VE JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN): The first of the unreleased songs on the album.  Great beat, nice vocals, a very fun song overall. <br /> <br />DO SOMETHIN': This could easily become one of my favorite Britney songs ever.  It sounds similar to \\"Toxic,\\" but it has its own flavor.  Britney does say \\"f*ck\\" twice, but it's not as big a deal as some people would have you believe. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a GREAT album and if you are a Britney fan, you should definitely own it.  Scratch that - if you're a fan of music in general, you should own it.

B0000042H4|5.0|Let me confess that I generally read other reviewers' comments, and am grateful for their efforts.  It is my belief that they are also truthful.  Some are quite thorough, offering comparisons between the different versions of the Ring.  This is interesting but, in my opinion, not necessary.  Solti's Ring, with the VPO and a cast second to none, is a superb effort. <br /> <br />This does not mean there are no weaknesses.  The Ring is a massive work, extremely demanding of all resources.  Solti's approach can only be described as \\"epic\\" and if this is to your taste, you need look no further. <br /> <br />Perhaps other conductors are much more sensitive to certain portions of the work.  In my opinion, this often results in the sacrifice of some other aspect of the work.  In other words, the Ring can become a zero-sum game; if you have weak singers, maybe it is necessary to back off the orchestra, vice versa if the orchestral demands cannot be met.  Ideally, a combination of a powerful orchestra with premier Wagnerian singers is needed.  And let's not forget the reading of the work, where the conductor's hand really plays a critical role in one's ability to extract the most from the work. <br /> <br />It is understood that due to the weight of the conductor's approach on the ultimate expression of the music, then the Ring, like any other interpretation, is really irrevocably linked to that conductor.  Hence, this Ring is really an expression of Wagner's Ring as Solti sees it, and any review is really, to a significant extent, a leap of faith for the reader. <br /> <br />That being the given, I believe that Solti's Ring meets all of  the criteria for a superb Ring on all levels, namely: interpretation, musicianship, and vocal quality. <br /> <br />Interpretation: <br /> <br />As already stated, Solti's view of the Ring is that it is an \\"epic.\\"  As such, it leaves little room to be introspective, and this may be a significant weakness to certain listeners.  Hence, any negative reviews with respect to this particular reading of the Ring may be simply due to the fact that the reviewer seeks a more sensitive approach.  And since the conductor's approach permeates virtually every facet of the work (musicianship, singing, etc.), the conductor should therefore get the blame. <br /> <br />By the same token, the conductor merits all the accolades if the approach appeals to the listener.  In my view, Solti's approach can be described as \\"unafraid\\" or even \\"courageous.\\"  He harnesses the full capability of the VPO and the singers to present this massive drama in its full glory and complexity.  He does not restrain the orchestra, but rather, frees it to express itself.  The singers, being the best of their time, are also led to excel.  For some, this borders on \\"showing off,\\" for others, it comes with the territory in relation to a work on the scale of the Ring. <br /> <br />Musicianship: <br /> <br />The VPO was the best orchestra in the world at the time of these recordings.  The strings have an exceptionally sweet sound; the brass is \\"broad\\" as Solti himself described.  This juxtaposition is balanced by the other orchestral forces---and a painstaking attention to detail under the directorship of John Culshaw---achieving a balanced yet powerful sound. <br /> <br />However, some reviewers may complain that the use of special sound effects is not \\"natural.\\"  Again, this is a valid point.  Some prefer to hear only the music and the singing.  Going too far the other way with too many effects, and the net effect is distraction instead of support.  (Can you imagine if the horses' gallop is captured in the \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\"?) <br /> <br />In my opinion, the approach taken in this version of the Ring is appropriate.  There is supposedly some action on the stage, so it is important to capture, say, the steerhorns as they approach closer, or Wotan's spear striking the rock as he summons Loge.  The key here is to balance the relevant action of the drama with the music, and I believe this is appropriate for the Ring. <br /> <br />Vocals: <br /> <br />Alas, the vocals are the most difficult to describe in sufficient detail to convince one way or another.  The reason is not just the performers themselves, but also the timeframe under which they perform.  It must be remembered that this Ring was \\"constructed\\" over many years.  Hence, we actually capture the performers at different points in their careers.  The impact is not only on vocal quality, but also on interpretation. <br /> <br />A case in point is Hotter's Wotan.  In Siegfried, his vocal command is superb, but in Walkure, it is faulty.  Nilsson, on the other hand, is fairly consistent throughout; her power and control is evident (although her voice could be best described as \\"maternal,\\" hardly a quality associated with a youthful demi-goddess Walkure). <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the cast in this Ring performs to the task with great zeal, even if in certain cases it is uneven.  But this will probably be found in any interpretation of the Ring.  At least, in my opinion, the cast in this Ring is superior to anything more modern, and when combined with the VPO's playing, can lead to some exhilarating moments. <br /> <br />Summary: <br /> <br />In my opinion, the Solti Ring can certainly be compared to others but, in the end, it is not necessary.  In all the criteria of interpretation, musicianship and singing, this Ring is the best to date.  But again, take this review on faith.
B0002858YS|3.0|Ok, initially i was pretty excited, I had high hopes for band de jour 'The Killers', a little premature maybe, but ever since i heard a sample of 'Mr Brightside' on a recent episode of Hollyoaks, ive been hearing some really great things about these new 'Sin City' rockers. <br />  <br /> So far so good, i wasnt immediatly dissapointed 'Mr Brightside' is a highly under appreciated song, a cracking little track, and for me definatly the highlight of the album, hours of air guitar fun to be had with that. I loved it!. Although as much as i wish it weren't so it has to be said that the the rest of the album seems to be lacking in something, something crucial that would distinguish between 'Hot Fuss' being a great album and as it stands a fairly good, possibly bordering on average album.  <br /> <br />  After a couple more tracks such as 'Smile like you mean it' it appears to be slightly going downhill. Dont get me wrong there's nothing particularly wrong with any of the tracks. It just all sounds a bit similar. with tracks such as 'All these things' which can only really be described as a bit tedious, although i did enjoy the gospel group sample towards the end. It does in all tend to drag on a bit. <br />  <br /> The band isnt wildly different to any other shaggy haired group around at the moment, but that isnt nessasarily a bad thing, the comparrisons with 'The Strokes' and other such guitar based bands are clearly there, but hey, if your going to be compared to anyone atleast its to a band that are pretty damn good in the first place! <br /> My main worry for 'The Killers' is that, i wonder how long it will will take for the novelty to wear off, and inevitably after this, do they have what it takes to make that oh so crucial second album, or like so many good bands before them will they  stumble and dissapear finally into musical oblivion for all eternity.
B00005ALP6|4.0|My Fair Lady is a great musical and a marvelous movie to go and watch, in my opinion is not a good interpretation of G.B. Shaw's, Pygmalion. It is not strong as it could be. We can clearly appreciate that most of the script is followed. The characters in the musical are not as good as the ones play, this is because some of the character are rather weak in comparison to the play or in other words the perception you get about them when reading Pygmalion.  <br />Eliza Doolittle, a beautiful, funny and smart flower girl is interpreted perfectly by Audrey Hepburn, who gets into the character and adds flavor to the musical, Mr. Higgins is also very well performed and I love the quality of expression and essence of Shaw's that the actor get to put on the play.  I found Colonel Pickering's character rather weak and quiet and Mr. Doolittle didn't fall in what I pictured, all of the other characters even the ones who were not suppose to, were joyful and add a soul of comedy and yet cynism to the play, although they didn't get to the cynism that Shaw skillfully gets to. <br />I think G.B. Shaw would be disappointed if he had seen this version of his so famous play; the musical barely represents the satire he in his book. The middle class morality and the hypocrisy there could be in the upper class are scarcely represented; thus musical is more a comedy in comparison to the play. I think Shaw would have found ridiculous and nonsensical that gentlemen such as: Mr. Higgins and Colonel Pickering sing in the play, and that the whole affair of singing the author would have considered it silly. <br />Although the script was followed some scenes were replaced, therefore we can say that the movie is not a loyal representation of the play. I think the reason for substituting some scenes is because they didn't fit into what the musical was, but it confuses me somewhat that characters like Clara don't appear in the play. <br />The setting of the musical was great, I think that it concurred with the original play, and the costumes were ideal for the characters. In conclusion I think My Fair Lady is a great movie to watch more than once, yet it does not transmit the essence of Mr. Shaw's original play. <br /> <br />
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|<br />  I think i speak for many when i say that the arrival of Franz Ferdinand is gladly welcomed,  <br /> We could all do with a band that is just that little bit special, or i'll atleast settle for new band to appear on the scene that isnt named 'The' somethings.  <br />          <br />          So altogether now Hurrah for Franz Ferdinand. <br /> <br /> I will freely admit that before listening to the album i was like many ready to dismiss Franz Ferdinand as yet another snake hipped, messy haired band ready to jump aboard the indie/guitar/whatever/rock band wagon, but i take it all back they're actually very good. <br /> <br /> They may not be completely original, obviously there are comparrisons to other guitar bands such as 'The Strokes','Suede' and even 'The Clash'in places, but honestly does it really matter? certainly not to me, not if they're good, and Franz Ferdinand are brilliant, and they're debut album more than proves it.This is one band that is definatly not about the Hype, Its all about the music baby. <br /> <br /> The quartet originating from Glasgow came together with the unique musical idea that they wanted to create music for girls to dance. I'd say they've firmly acomplished what they set out to do, <br />  <br />The first single to be released from the album is the fabulous 'Take me out' which in all fairness starts of fairly inoffensivly, just about ticking all the right boxes for a fairly average guitar band, with fairly unimpressionable guitars and filler lyrics, However this all radically changes as the chorus prepares to make its grand entrance, the verse slows right down to an unexpected halt before making your hairs stand on air with a simple yet fantastically strong bass line, striking like a repetitive punch in the face for all those who ever dared undirestimated the talent of Franz Ferdinand. <br />  <br /> As the album continues it doesnt fail to impress, each offering on this album is a little peice of genius, with its own unique selling point,from the impossibly catchy 'Cheating on You' to the classic 'Michael' <br /> <br /> What i love about the album is that it has a wonderfully unrushed quality about it , the lyrical content is never less than perfect, simple and straight to the point, with each song telling its own quirky little tale, for example 'Take me Out' is supposedly meant to be about two snipers hunting each other down, <br /> <br /> I think we can optimistically expect a second album as i get the feeling that Franz Ferdidnand will be around for a while.  Granted the basic musical style in each song is fairly similar throughout, yet it works brilliantly and that is what gives this band its credibitlity and definate staying power, they've found the right style that works for them and they're sticking with it. <br /> <br />Also if you in the mood for something camp as christmas, and frankly a little weird, check out the 'Sissor Sisters' uber gay version of 'Take me Out'  <br /> It'll put a smile on your face if nothing else. <br />
B000002696|3.0|I recall one review that described Bitches Brew as 'the shot heard around the world'. The album itself is a frenzied jazz soup, winding electric guitars playing off of each other, trilling keyboards, slinky basslines, and powerful driving percussion rhythms. But if there's one constant, it's the reverberating echoes of Miles Davis' horn. Yes the sound may be cluttered compared to earlier cool jazz, but the genius of 'Bitches Brew' is the spirit of improvisation, allowing the band to communicate with each other, through back-and-forth type musical banter creating a language that is dense and complicated, at the sametime lush and beautiful. Only Miles Davis is brazen and crazy enough to create something this daring and unconventional. 'Bitches Brew' is the powerful force, innovative and revolutionary, by which all electric jazz recordings were spawned from.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is the last great(maybe even good)Metallica album. If you crave long songs, this is the album for you. \\"One\\" blows the rest of the songs out of the water, but not a bad song on the album.  Favorite Songs: \\"One\\" and \\"To Live Is To Die\\"
B000031EGV|4.0|My wife and I first saw Jumanji on the day we were due to deliver our first daughter. Last weekend I showed it to that daughter, now eight, and her six-year old sister. I have never seen kids so engaged in a movie as they were with Jumanji. They shouted warnings to the characters, jumped back when animals charged and instinctively raised their feet when floodwaters filled the house during the movie. The youngest has since begged me to let her take it to school to show her class.<br /><br />Personally, I thought it was cute and entertaining. As to buying it, I wouldn't if it was just for me but having seen the way my kids behaved while watching it, I'll be getting it in a heartbeat.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is awesome. A few so-so tracks, but the rest of the songs make up for them. Great sophomore album.  <br />Favorite songs: \\"Call of Ktulu,\\" \\"Fade to Black\\"
B000002UA9|5.0|It had to start somewhere and after the success of the \\"Please Please Me\\" single in the UK, producer George Martin knew he had to get a Beatle album out pretty quickly.  So this album was recorded pretty quickly.  Imagine a Beatles gig at The Cavern.  It was magically reproduced within the friendly and controllable confines of Abbey Road Studio #2.  Any study of The Beatles' music has to start here.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This is a great collection of songs. Not many are well-known, but are good in their own right. Any true PJ fan would appreciate these songs for what they are.  Favorite Songs: \\"Footsteps,\\" \\"Yellow Ledbetter,\\" \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" \\"Sad,\\" \\"Alone.\\"
B000002UAF|5.0|Not a flop in these 13 tracks.  The first 7 tracks (side one of the original LP) are the actual tunes from the soundtrack.  The remaining 6 tracks (side two of the original LP) were also composed for the film, but do not appear on the soundtrack (although a re-release of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in the 1980s included a prologue with \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" on the soundtrack.)  This album is also significant in that it's the only Beatle album to consist entirely of Lennon/McCartney compositions.  Later Beatle albums of all-original material included songs by George Harrison and two albums had a Ringo composition.
B00005JMUA|1.0|If you like to see tabbacco spit being sprayed on women .. buy this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like to see women covered in sweat, dirt, grime, blood for most of the movie .... buy this one. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like to listen to a frustrated 'little grasshopper' David Carradine pontificate as he did in his 'Kung Fu' TV movie for what seems like hours and hours ... yup, buy this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />If you want to see our heroine, Uma, get blasted by the unbelievably dumb dumb brother of Bill almost at the beginning of the movie, making you wonder 'hey what the world' ..  <br /> <br /> <br />OK you get the picture ..  <br /> <br /> <br />What a shock for me, this is one disjointed Tarantino film and I can't belive that Uma Thurman even read the script before signing on.  After watching this movie with my son last night he gave me fair warnig that it would be better for me not to review this film cause he knew that it was a one star special. He then told me that maybe I should give it 2 or 3 stars to avoid that absolute pounding my feedback ratings are going to get from the Tarantino/Thurman fans ... He is probably right since I was one of the few people that gave Jar Jar Binks, of Star Wars fame a positive review that cost me dearly .... <br /> <br /> <br />In any case ... this is one overated movie that I hope slithers into oblivion .......   <br />
