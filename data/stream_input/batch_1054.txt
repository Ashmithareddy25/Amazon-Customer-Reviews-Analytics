B003YK42LQ|3.0|First two albums were glorious; drop the needle (so to speak)anywhere in the disc and it would lift you up, lyrically and musically. Sweep you up.The 3rd one was a big great step forwards. The 4th one was understandable. I had high hopes for this latest release, but already with the first cut I am thinking \\"this sounds like \\"Sex on Fire/Use Somebody II\\". U2 had the global vision to absorb and digest synthesizers - KOL sounds swallowed up by the sounds and lost. And will someone please take that reverb knob away from them. The songs sound like they are coming via formula: hear the initial bassline, Matthew's guitar lines soaked in delays and reverb, Nathan ( a great drummer btw) working in the odd snare hit, and then the melodies that have become repetitive. This used to be one of their strengths: Caleb's vocal melodies that once had no rules.  I don't understand the reviews about \\"back to their roots\\" ; I don't hear the influences from listening to Towns, or Ry Cooder's slide; it seems to be going exactly the opposite way. I was reading an interview where Caleb was saying \\"This was before I knew how to talk to a celebrity\\". Maybe they should unlearn all that as soon as possible.

B003FSTN52|5.0|A well presented and neatly packaged compilation of all 21 episodes of the first season of this well written, produced, directed and acted series.  Finally!, someone(s) has/have come up with the idea of presenting a network program that appeals to an adult and/or mature audience (what a great concept!).  Thanks to those who have concieved this new addition to prime-time television.<br /><br />The inside of the DVD container offers mini-synopses of each episode and the DVDs themselves are loaded with special features - cast,crew and writer(s) commentaries; deleted scenes; actor interviews, etc.  Highly recommended viewing.
0811876373|4.0|Purchased this book to try my hand at \\"Cake Pops\\" after following Bakearella's email blogs.  The instructions are very repetitious (same basic instructions repeated with each different \\"Pop\\").  Book could have had more variety of \\"Pops\\" if the instructions had been edited a bit.  Otherwise very happy with this purchase, photography - excellent, book style - excellent, price payed through amazon.com fantastic!!

1416914307|5.0|Clary, Jace, Simon, Alec and Isabelle (Magnus, Luke and a cast of many more) all swept into a fast paced tale of deception, lies, love and sacrafice.<br /><br />How far would you go for the one you love?  Would you be willing to die?<br /><br />As Jace and Clary try to come to terms with the fact that they're related and cannot be together the way the both would like is more than they can deal with.<br /><br />Jace in an effort to escape Clary and try to separate himself from who their father is and what he's done and wants to do; tries to confince Simon to lie for him and avoid taking Clary to Idris in search of the one person who may know the cure to the sleep state her mother is in.<br /><br />Clary in her anger from being left behind uses her new found rune making power to create a portal to take herself there Luke grabs her as she heads through and thus begins the newest adventure of the crew.<br /><br />With the story of loss and discovery of how love can change us and desperation can drive us to despair and quick judgement the crew succeeds and finally eliminating the father that Clary never knew.<br /><br />Along the way many are lossed, alliances are formed and story line strings are left undone for a possible new book in the series.  Although this was stated to be the final installment there are now going to be three more novels in the series and all I can say is YES YES YES!!!!<br /><br />BIG SPOILER ALERT *Don't Read if you don't really want to know*  The one thing you hope for or at least I did throughout the series the truth finally comes to light and in a way like the characters your give a sigh of relief.  I'll just say there is nothing wrong or weird about loving someone who isn't related to you. :-)<br /><br />I can't wait the next book is due out April 5, 2011.
0316077054|5.0|I love this series. Beautiful Darkness was a perfect sequel to Beautiful Creatures. There is so much depth in the story. It's fascinating to see how the original & the new characters are developing and how they are intertwined with each other. Also witnessing how the past events correlate with the present has been enjoyable. Garcia and Stohl has absolutely made this series spellbinding. There were a few gripping revelations that were uncovered in this book and new questions that was brought up to keep you engrossed. This is a highly addictive series by far than any series I've read in the past. I can't wait to read book #3.

B0015FQZJE|5.0|This is probably my favorite Lamb of God Album.  Getting into vinyl recordings as of late, I decided to get &#34;Ashes of the Wake&#34; in LP form.  I am specifically reviewing the vinyl recording, which is pretty good.  Compared to other digitally recorded or re-mastered albums that are pressed onto 180 gram vinyl, the sound quality is mediocre, but still favorable. It is pretty cool that newer recordings are even being pressed in vinyl, so I'm happy to have it to add to my collection.<br />I would like to say; if you are new to vinyl, all recordings are not made equal, and this one is just OK.  It does come with a free digital download to get the same album in MP3 format for free.<br />UPDATE: Almost six years later...  I recently did a total overhaul on my sound system.  New speakers, amp, turntable,  the works.  I've listened to this LP at least ten times on the new system and I have to say,  sound quality is really good. I may have misjudged it on my mediocre system thinking it was a mediocre album.  Sound quality is actually great,  and for not being a special 180g remastered, audiophile (insert more pretentious terms here)  it sounds terrific.  Besides, since I got this,  LoG has released quite a few albums,  and this is still undoubtedly my favorite.  If you're into metal, LoG and vinyl,  it's a must have!

0061148512|5.0|I reread the Bell Jar every couple of years and have done so since I was 18.  It's so much more than a morbid ride or a thinly-veiled autobiography.  It's one of few great coming-of-age stories that we have as women.  I've long since stopped reading this book as a glimpse into Sylvia's soul or coming suicide.  I've also stopped reading it as a precursor to the coming feminist movement of the 1960s.  I'm drawn back to it again and again because it's simply a well-told story.  It's subtle, complex and occasionally very very funny.
B000TSUCAQ|4.0|The book arrived quickly and looked brand new.  The cover was a bit pushed in in one area, but that could have happened while being shipped.  Otherwise I was happy with the purchase.
B003DT19F0|5.0|I was surprised to like this movie as much as I did. My daughter is a Tink fan, and she has both of the other Tinkerbell movies, which are fun, but nothing I'd watch again and again. I couldn't imagine that Disney could come up with anything original, but they did.    Thank goodness they broke from the tired \\"mean, selfish child\\" antagonist (anyone remember Sid from Toy Story?). The little girl in this movie is KIND, of all things. You don't see kind children depicted much in movies these days. It was refreshing to see a child who was actually, dare I say it, nice.  Not the fakey, Barney-loves-you kind of nice, but genuinely nice. A kid you'd actually like to be around. What a welcome relief.    Tink and the other fairies are their ususal selves, with one exception: Vidia.  They changed Vidia's character without giving any hints as to why she changed - she's just suddenly a caring, concerned friend. Really?? That's not the Vidia we know and despise. If they're going to change her character, they need to let us know what caused her to leave her selfish ways behind.    All in all, it's a fun story that I found more enjoyable than the other two Tink movies. And I loved the way they tied in elements from the original Peter Pan story, such as setting parts of the story in London and having Tink teach the little girl how to fly. Sweet!
0312600844|1.0|Despite the Oprah sticker, I wanted to like this book.  The synopsis on the inside cover piqued my interest.  But once I started reading...what a mistake.    I didn't think I would ever finish this book.  The only reason I continued reading was when your stuck camping in the rain in a two man tent it was either read or get soaking wet.  I think I made the wrong choice, much like buying this book.    Too bad the author did not adapt Walter's environmentally conscious attitude and make this a short story.  Could have saved a lot of trees.    The book has no plot, just characters who walk through life.  When one character died....I didn't care.  Why? because Franzen never made her real to me.

1416972250|4.0|CITY OF GLASS, by Cassandra Clare, was my favorite book of this series. Clare wrapped up the story absolutely perfectly. This book was jam-packed with action and suspense that made my adrenaline run wild!    One main thing (among many) that made me love this book so much was the humor. There has been humor in all of the books, but in the midst of an all out war, I think the sarcasm and quips of these characters lightened the mood and truly made this a phenomenal book. The fact that Simon was now the main focus of not one but two females, and could not decide between the two was hilarious and cute. And pretty much anything Magnus said made me laugh, gosh I love that man.    The main relationships were resolved (finally) and I have to say I am very pleased (finally). Learning the truth between Jace, Clary, and Sebastian definitely made my jaw drop. But, I do feel bad about how mentally damaged Jace is now after being duped by his father once again. And one final \\"finally\\" for Alec and Magnus. I was so proud of Alec for letting his true self show to his family.    The action was pretty awesome as well. Clare's visuals for the fight scenes were amazing and I felt like I was inside the book watching it occur in front of me. Overall, this was the perfect ending to this trilogy and I am very excited that Cassandra has decided to extend the Mortal Instruments Series into another trilogy. After reading the excerpt for City of Fallen Angels, in the back of this book, all I have to say is TEASE!
0143118420|2.0|Haven't read any reviews by anyone about this book, but noted that it was a \\"hot read\\" at the library, so gave it a go.   Its not what I expected.   The early section in New York I enjoyed about Elizabeths marriage and new love affair; and Elizabeth's travels in Italy also were fun reading (being a food lover, I could relate to the enjoyment of good food in Italy) and then.........We get to India, and I had to skim read the pages and pages and pages about meditation etc.   God, that was boring.   Could not wait for that part of the book to be over.    Onto Indonesia, and slightly more interesting, but still a lot of chatter about meditation and life.    There are obviously people who love the book, and that is great to find a book that enthralls and motivates you so much, but alas, I was not one of them.

0452286751|5.0|I had just finished Atlas Shrugged and realized Ayn Rand had insight into the minds of social justice progressives unlike anything seen or read today.

One cannot go wrong with Ayn Rand.
B00000IPAX|5.0|How can without a doubt of the greatest punk rock albums of all time have 131 ONE STARS!!  I can guarantee you that they are ALL probably freaking all up the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Misfit's A$$.  Granted those are great classic punk bands.   But this, like any genre of rock, is an evolved version of something else.  But that in no way means it deserves a one star.  I'm only 20 years old and grew up listening to Blink from the time I was 7 years old and my cousin had the Dude Ranch CD.  I listened to that thing over and over again, I couldn't get enough of it.  Blink is part of what is without a doubt a part of the HUGE oxymoron that is, Pop-Punk.  Pop-Punk in general is a commercialized version of punk rock with a crisper/cleaner sound that is easier to listen to and appeals to the public more.  IE, teenagers and young adults.  Blink is just one of those bands that Universal decided to put there money behind and sell.  And oh boy did they sell.  I doubt that any other band was as backed as much as Blink.  A lot of other bands of the same style around at that time were just as good, but Blink had the giant execs at Universal Music Group to back them up.  Blink is probably the biggest pop punk band of the past 15 years, next to Green Day.  Which are probably more \\"true\\" punk than Blink, in their own way. I personally believe this is Blink's masterpiece.  Chesire Cat was very rough and was the early works of a band poised for Super Stardom.  Dude Ranch showed a more polished sound, with a mix of that rough punk mixed in.  Enema was the KING record for Blink.  They really came into their own and had developed that sound was all their own.  Take Off Your Pants & Jacket showed more the same.  There self titled album in 2003 showed a new \\"serious/experimental\\" direction.  I didn't care for that record as much, still pretty good though.  Now Blink is set to release a new album in 2011 that has anticipation higher than any record they've ever set to put out.      So what's my rating, FIVE STARS, without thinking twice.

006145205X|5.0|Against the tide of doom a few voices can be heard.  Voices of people who look at the world as it Actually Is, and not as their gloomy mindsets paint it to be.  Here is such a book.  Expanding on the ideas found in Julian Simon's \\"The Ultimate Resource\\", Matt Ridley makes convincing argument that the world is actually NOT going to hell in a handbasket.  For me, his story of how trading and the \\"collective brain\\" have been the key drivers of progress was made most compellingly in the story of what happened to the native Tasmanians.  Read it and you will see.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is one of the best new shows to come out of last season's lineup. It's absolutely riddled with pop culture references and homages to movies. Seriously, the paintball episode was so full of them I was cracking up. I would honestly compare this show to something like Spaced, a great show with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, because of the way it pays homage to so many films. Community is worth a watch because it never takes itself too seriously and always manages to make you laugh. I highly recommend this show to everyone. There's no qualifier there. Everyone should watch this show!
0132350882|5.0|This is a fantastic book about writing clean code and test driven development.  Robert dedicated an entire chapter, 14, to refactoring code and included why he refactored the way he did.  Thats not all, the way Robert wrote this book is from one coder to another meaning you are his audience; very refreshing.  He doesn't hold your hand, but gives you enough information to get you literally on the same page as him with every line.  The patterns and \\"smell tests\\" included here are worth the cost of this book alone.    This book got me passionate about coding again and about unit testing.  If you are a programmer, it doesn't matter what language, (I write python mostly) this book deserves a place on your bookshelf.
0743497465|3.0|On very rare occasions, you come across a story wherein the events that unfold are so compelling that you're willing to deal with terrible dialogue, overuse of exclamation points, and obvious inconsistencies.  Dan Brown's Deception Point provides such an occasion.<br /><br />If Brown had written the outline and sold it to a(n even slightly) better writer, this would have been a wonderful novel.  As it stands, however, I found myself wanting to throw the book out the window for the poor writing--only to find myself too entranced by the story it nearly ruins.<br /><br />That said, it really is a good story.  Brown uses national politics, military intrigue, and science & technology to drive the reader along an exciting and dynamic path.<br /><br />You won't necessarily be guessing the entire length of the novel, but you'll be compelled to read on to check your predictions.  If you're expecting major twists, the books biggest strength will turn into a major downfall as you read on.  Brown does a wonderful job of building up scenarios, detailing pieces of personalities, technologies, and scenery that come into play later on.  The problem is that Brown seems to stick to a pattern; by the climax I was able to predict where individual set pieces would end up, and how that would affect the outcome.  Still, I read on to \\"see\\" it unfold, and it was a good ride.  A couple of details were surprises, but they did not change the inertia of the plot at all.<br /><br />At some point, I started visualizing the story as a Michael Bay film (though a good one), so I forgave the pieces of bad dialogue.  The characters, while mostly enjoyable (I say \\"mostly\\" because one character, Corky, was close to being the Jar Jar Binks of Deception Point), are flat; again, this is surprisingly forgivable once you tune your mind correctly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I could not recommend this book as a purchase.  It's definitely worth a read for the story itself, but the terrible writing is distracting at best.  I found myself counting the exclamation points per page and dog-earing pages with inconsistent thought identifiers or conflicting actions.  (The biggest offender of actions: someone \\"stands back up\\" twice, though there's no mention of them sitting in the first place.)<br /><br />In the end, I can honestly say I enjoyed this book--enough not to toss it out of a window.  Find yourself a copy sitting on a friend's bookshelf, or check it out from your local library.exclamation points per page and dog-earing pages with inconsistent thought identifiers or conflicting actions.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|THE PACIFIC from HBO is the true story of three Marines, Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale), Eugene Sledge (Joe Mazzello) and John Basilone (Jon Seda) and their journeys through the bloody Pacific theater of World War II, from Guadalcanal to Cape Gloucester to Peleliu to Iwo Jima to Okinawa and, finally, for two of them, the journey home.<br /><br />Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and others who were responsible for BAND OF BROTHERS, THE PACIFIC is, without question, a companion piece to that earlier acclaimed HBO mini-series.<br /><br />Perhaps the major difference between the two ten-part series, aside from the fact that one takes place in the European theater of World War II and the other is set in the Pacific, is that BAND OF BROTHERS deals with a company of soldiers, whereas THE PACIFIC centers on only three Marines.  We, as viewers, are therefore more able to narrow our focus and understand the harrowing emotional struggles that these Marines experience.<br /><br />Like with BAND OF BROTHERS, the many battle sequences in this show are extremely realistic, violent and horrifying, as are the post-battle scenes.  They may have been the enemy, but seeing the bodies of hundreds of mutilated, dead Japanese on the beach the morning after a nights-long firefight is very appalling.<br /><br />We, of couse, mourn the dead in THE PACIFIC, but this film compels us to equally mourn the loss of humanity suffered by the survivors, such as Eugene Sledge, a sensitive young man from Alabama who, by war's end, has become a brutal killing machine.<br /><br />Interestingly, the two most emotionally involving one-hour episodes of the series are #3 (\\"Melbourne\\") and #10 (\\"Home\\"), neither of which feature battle sequences.  In the first one, the Marines from Guadalcanal are sent to Australia for a rest and one of them, Robert Leckie, becomes involved in a romantic relationship that the lady ends because she fears he will be killed.  In the final episode, the men return home after the war and try to adjust to civilian life.  Both of these episodes are extremely touching.<br /><br />THE PACIFIC is a magnificent epic production, beautifully written and directed, and filled with haunting images and memorable performances by a cast of, for the most part, unknown players.  It is also a production that people who shy away from extremely violent films should avoid.<br /><br />A sixth disc in the handsomely boxed set contains the following extras:<br /><br />PROFILES OF THE PACIFIC contains several 10 minute featurettes about the real characters portrayed in the mini-series, including interviews with many of them and their family members.<br /><br />MAKING THE PACIFIC is a 20+ minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" documentary that includes interviews with Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and several of the key actors.<br /><br />ANATOMY OF THE PACIFIC WAR is a 10-minute featurette that includes newsreel footage and interviews with scholars, who give a historical perspective to the Pacific war.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000056IKS|4.0|Let me date myself by saying I bought Kraftwerk's \\"Autobahn\\" (on vinyl, of course) and Harmonia's two albums new in the stores way back in my youth. I even found around then a used copy of one of Michael Rother's solo albums, which while interesting didn't go in the direction I was exploring back then, so somehow I'd not ever sampled anything by Neu!. Their work just didn't make it to the West Coast (where I was then) in anything but very sparse numbers, I suppose, so I was only vaguely aware of their existence. They were a notch below Can on the radar screen, and hardly anybody had heard of them.<br /><br />Thus it was quite a treat to hear this album for the first time, finally. It is not nearly as lush as some of Can's or Tangerine Dream's work; only rarely does this album realm into the kosmiche. At times it seems quite mechanical and harsh to my more modernly tuned ears, though this may be a side-effect of the prevalence of guitars then compared to the almost entirely synthetic music now which often takes this as its early inspiration. They really were trying to create something entirely new, and their experiments were success enough often enough to still sound interesting.<br /><br />There were one or two moments where I could sense the genesis of several places on Harmonia's first album, which was a pleasant surprise.  Is it just me, or is the last track positively Nico-ish?<br /><br />Anyway, it'll be interesting to fill in this large gap in my musical/historical knowledge by getting Neu!'s subsequent two albums. 4 - 4 1/2 stars.
B003ELOQCA|3.0|I'm a big U2 fan and have all of their concert videos, including this one.  But this video was a major disappointment.  The actual concert was great, but the video makes the concert seem very disjointed, and it is seriously over-edited.  The rapid shot changes are extremely annoying and really take away from the concert experience.  I actually prefer the streamed YouTube version, even with the lower video quality.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|I've always enjoyed Van Morrison, the Irish-American singer and songwriter who has had several monster hits in his day, including 'Moondance', 'Gloria', and 'Brown-Eyed Girl'.  (A bit of trivia about the last; it was supposed to be 'Brown-Skinned Girl', but that was back in the day when producers felt the theme might hurt record sales.)<br /><br />'Best of' compilations can be hit or miss; this one is a hit.  There are all the usual favorites here, and some more obscure but just as rewarding tunes included.  'Warm Love' is one that I've never heard before; it's an introspective song that is more catchy than you'd suppose.<br /><br />This has quickly become one of my favorite CDs.  The early tunes are a bit overplayed, but the 'meat' of the collection hold up to repeated listening.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  If you are a Van Morrison fan, this is a must have.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I have many concert videos from various artists, and I think this is probably the best one I've ever seen.  It is VERY well produced, elegant and smooth transitions, and you really feel like you're at the concert.

B003IDEX04|5.0|I am an extremely busy middle school (6-8) Reading and Language Arts Teacher. At the beginning of the year, I was told that I would only teach Reading but because of budget and number of kids they also asked me to teach LA even though I haven't taught it in previous years. So, all the things I had planned on doing so elaborately with my Reading classes had to be cut-down. However, I have an 7th/8th grade mostly gifted group and wanted to give them a challenge. I chose Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl because it was below level as far as a lot of their lexiles are concerned but instructional level for some of the contextual clue vocab and situational information. A lot of them didn't know what a fountain pen was..<br /><br />But one caveat, there is some personal things Anne goes through about halfway through the book that our principal decided she did not want to publicly share with the class which included Anne having self-exploratory dreams (masturbation) as well as girl-girl exploratory visions and occurrences (hinting on lesbianism). I don't believe this would be an issue for high schoolers but as middle schoolers we did not feel comfortable exposing that information to them (even if our society, esp our young people, are already sexting, etc. We had to think of the parents in this case). Beyond that, the TEXT IS FANTASTIC!! Please share this will all groups aged 13-18!

I remember seeing this movie in the theater and wondering half way through it when Sean Penn was going to show up. He was so deep in his character that I didn't even notice he'd been there since the opening scene. Carloto's way is better than Scarface in both story and character not to mention the soundtrack.  A must have for any, gangster movie, Al Pacino or Sean Penn fan.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I have no idea if today's children would like this movie.  I just know I adored Nanny McPhee Returns.  I'm in my 60s.  This movie was so heart warming, I'll admit I shed a few tears.  Reminded me of the great Disney movie Darby O'Gill and the Little People.  Just an adorable little film.  Why don't they make more movies like they did in the fifties?  Surely not every film has to be made for teenagers?
B0041VV03A|1.0|Quite possibly the most idiotic film ever made  Formulaic, cheap, absurd, immature sentiments  If you like a horror film which feigns intelligence every step of the way, you might like this film, you might also be an idiot  Do yourself a favor and skip it. If you need to watch a horror film, any other would constitute better spent time. They should pay you to watch this garbage.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|This product is great. You get what you pay for, and this is exactly what I've paid for. This product is exactly was I was looking for, it is so Apple like, which is great because i have all apple computers. I highly recommend this product.
B001PP9ALY|2.0|While the idea of this movie was pretty good, the execution was poor.  It was incredibly unrealistic and Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman added absolutely nothing to the film.  Yes, there was a lot of action, and if that's your thing I would say go ahead and rent this one - but for me, it just wasn't enough to give it more than 2 stars.

B003DT19F0|5.0|This movie was fun for parents and children.  Well written with great animation.  This has the quality of a theatrical release.  They did a great job of really giving character to each of the individual fairies.  There are some real laugh-out-loud moments in this movie.  You will not be disappointed.
0765326353|5.0|This is the first Sanderson book I've read. It has everything good fantasy should have. Great environments, great magic systems, and great characters. Unlikely other epics, this has a limited number of main characters, which makes it easier to keep track of everything, and lets the characters be developed more. The final battle is the stuff of dreams, and Sanderson writes so well that you can actually picture it happening right in front of you. I am really looking forward to the next book in this series.

0307474712|2.0|This book was good enough for what it was--a beach read. It tells the same story that you've heard/read/seen a million times, just from a new lens. The characters are interesting enough, and there are definitely a few memorable one-liners. By the end, though, I really just felt like the whole \\"One Day\\" perspective was a gimmicky way to get people to read your typical, cliched chick lit. I also thought the ending was a total cop-out, and I could practically see the author thinking, \\"This will be great when they make it into a movie.\\" Overall, not BAD by any means, just not impressive. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something that doesn't require you to think, or if you like the typical romcom.
0307474275|4.0|I have to join the ranks of those who enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  Having watched the movie years ago, I recently picked up the book as there were similarities to the new novel, \\"By A Thread\\" - a thriller with religious overtones.  While I enjoyed the movie I enjoyed the book more.  The religious overtones to the story were unique.  I also have to marvel at the seemingly never-ending instances of the grandfather's brilliance of symbolism upon symbolism throughout the story, with story telling making it all very believable.  The story was fast-paced from beginning to end with characters coming and going to suite the story's needs.  While I very much enjoyed the story I would have enjoyed stronger character development.  We got to learn of the two main characters as the story unfolded while the other characters seem to come and go.  I walked away from the story remembering its pace and the various intricacies of the story's symbolism, however the characters themselves did not stay with me.  I wish there had been better character development as was done in \\"By A Thread\\".  Also, there is no doubt a tremendous amount of research was conducted with a lot of information around which to frame a story.  With that said at times I felt, when reading the book, massive amounts of detail to be used thus craft a story to support the details.  With that said, however, still an enjoyable read!
0618871713|5.0|Unlike Alison Bechdel's childhood home, my house lacks a library, so I usually pass books along to new homes, but I want this one with me forever.  It's brilliant, affecting, stunning.  Wowwee kazowee!  Buy it, read it, keep it forever!
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|I have this same video, which I love.  This one was purchased as a gift.  The couple that received it loved it as much as I did.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|If we don't find ourselves as scared as we did a year ago, it's because, this time around, we know exactly what to expect. There will be phantom thuds. There will be objects that move on their own. There will be doors that slam without the aid of a living person or a sudden gust of wind. In \\"Paranormal Activity 2,\\" many of these phenomena are preceded by the sound of a low-frequency rumble, which essentially gives audiences a signal to prepare themselves, reducing the fright factor even further. All we have left are unoriginal shock tactics like sudden loud noises, bursts of poltergeist activity, and near the end, the now overused Queasy Cam. Sitting in the theater, I was disappointed. After leaving, it all made perfect sense; the first film worked so well that there was absolutely nothing anyone could have done to top it.    Having said that, it's a shame no one made more of an effort to keep it on equal terms. \\"Paranormal Activity\\" was a relentlessly frightening movie, largely because it didn't assault the audience with conventional pop out scares. It was slow and steady unfolding of disturbing subtleties, like a time-lapse shot of Katie Featherston standing over her sleeping boyfriend and staring at him for hours and hours. It made no real effort to explain the situation. I'd be hard pressed to say that there was even a plot - it was all just sort of ... happening. Not only does \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" have a discernable plot, it also provides an explanation for just about everything. This time around, there was no need to have it consist entirely of footage from surveillance cameras and camcorders; it could have been filmed and released as a standard supernatural thriller, complete with special effects, music, and sets.    With the exception of the final scene, the film is actually a prequel, taking place in the months prior to the events of \\"Paranormal Activity.\\" The focus is Katie's sister, Kristi (Sprague Grayden), who lives in Carlsbad with her husband, Dan(Brian Boland), her infant son, Hunter (William and Jackson Prietro), her teenage stepdaughter, Ali (Molly Ephraim), and the family dog. One day, they come home and discover that the house has been ransacked, although nothing was actually taken; fearing for their safety, Dan has six security cameras installed all throughout the house. Thus begins ... well, I think you know very well what begins. Many of the first film's unsettling touches are recreated, only this time, they're repeated to the point of monotony. Consider, for example, the persistent use of swimming pool footage; almost every sequence taking place in the middle of the night begins with a shot of the pool. It's an obvious attempt to get us to notice the automated cleaner, which gets out of the water seemingly on its own.    Would it surprise you to learn that both the dog and the toddler are more intuitive than anyone else in the house? If this long dead cliché doesn't bother you, then perhaps the Hispanic maid will. Never mind the fact that communication is possible in spite of the fact that she can only speak Spanish while her employers can only speak English; she's devoutly religious and seems to sense that something evil is in the house. At one point, she lights incense and walks through the kitchen while chanting something in low, terrified murmurs. Despite the best of intentions, she can't get anyone in the house to heed her warnings - and let me reiterate that she only speaks Spanish. The audience I sat with found this character funny for some reason. Have we come to the point where comedy relief in horror movies is defined solely by ethnicity?    The ending is immensely unsatisfying. Partly, it's because of an unpleasant decision made by certain characters, one that made me dislike them. Mostly, however, it was because the story actually resolved itself, and did so quite unoriginally. Watching it unfold, I began thinking about the conclusion of the previous film, which, at the time, I found absolutely horrifying; had I known it would be the catalyst for this prequel, I would have lobbied for writer/director Oren Peli to reinsert one of his two alternate endings, which, by their descriptions alone, are indisputably frightening.    When \\"Paranormal Activity\\" was first released, many agreed that it was one of the scariest films they had ever seen. I seriously doubt people will say the same thing about \\"Paranormal Activity 2.\\" Oh, it will certainly make you jump at times, but the slow, consistent, creeping terror of the original film is nowhere to be found. Was there any way this movie could have been better, or at the very least, just as good? I admit that I was excited when I first saw the trailer, but in all likelihood, that was just a fanboy reaction. I understand now - the bar was set too high, meaning there was nowhere for it to go other than down. This, of course, begs the question of why filmmakers push for sequels and/or prequels when it's clear that one film is all it takes. I live in hope that horror movies will someday be judged by their ability to scare people, not by their potential as the start of a franchise.

B003UYUR10|5.0|This is a terrific movie.  With an LED TV the Blu-ray plays as well as the movie screen at the local theater.  The quality of the DVD is also excellent.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|This movie does translate the truth about the delicate,(to say the least), relationship betwen the French armed forces, its citizens and the Algerians. The mix of the moslem  culture, and the nature of the Algerian customs derived from it from the old country are very well exposed if rather \\"cliche\\" in their presentation. It would have been, I am sure, very difficult to show them otherwise in a film, but the description of the mentality of the Algerian people is very well described in all facets.     The description of the French attitude toward the Algerians is quite correct in the film, although rather subdued in its presentation. Room is given to the other side, that of the Algerians, and that makes it very truthful as well as very touching at that. This is a very difficult film to watch and accept from a French viewpoint, yet it was way overdue.     This is a must see as this is the truth as it was, and still is in many circumstances. Many Frenchmen, like me, must feel ashamed of this historical past, but exposing it publicly may prevent it's come back and help in its waning in French society. The French government has recently passed a law to pay the owed pension to those Algerian soldiers on the same level as its citizens, only 60 years late...Until then, the Algerians only got about half that of the French citizens! At least this government had the limited courage to recognize the mistake of the previous ones. That, in itself, is a start.

0765348276|4.0|Like the title it's a fun book to read and interesting.   I found myself reading the whole book within two days as I couldn't put it down.   The influences are obvious as others have mentioned but the author manages to keep it fresh and different enough that I never felt like I was reading a Heinlein knock off novel.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|I didn't expect much going into this film at all, anticipating another \\"Ring 2\\"--how can one duplicate a rare, pleasantly creepy event like the first \\"PA\\"?  Well, they did, and in spades.  Director Tod Williams did not cheese or FX this one up even a little bit: it elaborates on the story between Katie (Katie Featherston reprising her role for bits and parts) and her sister Kristi Rey (who does look somewhat like Featherston.)  At the opening of the film we see Dan, Kristi's husband, and their newborn baby Hunter.<br /><br />To say that this is one dysfunctional family would be an understatement.  Dr. Phil or Jerry Springer would not have a chance in hell (no pun intended) helping out in this one.  Without spoiling the film for others, the basic premise as discovered by Ali (Dan's teenage daughter from a previous marriage) is as follows: someone in the family line made a bargain with a demon of some kind, the catch being that the first-born child of the family decades later would have to be sacrificed. If one looks closely, particularly when the young Hunter is in bed sleeping, one can see some nasty \\"subliminal images\\" hovering all over the place, which only makes the real scares (which really only occur about half an hour into the movie) all that much jolting. In the first film a parapsychologist from San Francisco showed up periodically, not providing them with too much help. The significant difference  between \\"PA\\" and \\"PA2\\" is that here there is a chance for actual assistance: Martine, the family's housekeeper/nanny, a sweet aging immigrant who knows there is something direly wrong the estate and acts on that intuition.<br /><br />I am not foreign to horror films, and this is one scary, riveting, and at times humorous horror movie.  As far as I'm concerned this as good as the first addition.
0545123267|4.0|In the world of vampires, faeries, ghosts, and witches, it seems like werewolf books aren't so common (unless you count Twilight, which focuses more on vampires than wolves). Maggie Stiefvater does a wonderful job in constructing the plot here: girl is saved by a werewolf whom she ultimately falls for over the course of watching him for years.<br /><br />The story of Grace and Sam is one that could easily become cliche and rife with sappy sentiments. Instead, the author makes their love intense and grounded, making it transcend the average teen romance.<br /><br />While there are the inevitable times where I can only assume the hero/heroine is having a typical teenager tantrum and acting like a fool (times where I literally rollled my eyes), overall the plot was solid. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, and I'm looking forward to reading it's sequel.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This was the first theater film for my two year old daughter.  She sat enthralled in her seat, munching popcorn from the first trailer through the credits.  I was very impressed that TS3 held her interest from start to finish.  We just watched this again on a recent Delta flight with the same result.    Toy Story 3 is a very good film that appeals on different levels to adults and children.  Unfortunately, a few of those themes disturb younger audiences, so be prepared to explain some scenes to your younger children.     My personal favorite Toy Story film is the first episode but my daughter seems to enjoy TS3 the best.  Jessie is her favorite character, so I assume that tilts the needle to TS3 for her.    I can't wait to see this film in Blu-Ray.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I have just received this DVD, and I must say that the movie is one of the best I have seen in this genre.  The movie is outstanding, and the action never stops. There is drama, love, action, thrills and so on.  This movie was made a long time ago but it is still great by today's standards. The psychology aspect of   the movie is also very interesting.  If you've never seen this movie before, do yourself a favor and get it!!! You'll love it!

0525951652|5.0|I was anxious to read another Ken Follett book but instead, for various reasons, I opted to get the book on CD. It was the right choice as it was such a pleasure 'to hear' that I am listening to it again. It was read like 'butter' spread on a warm chocolate chip muffin. Mr. Follett is known for his attention to detail and accuracy when portraying historical events and this book is no exception. History done well is interesting and it compels us to recognize our connections to it as we experience life/politics today. Follett has done this in this book. His characters were real and superbly chosen to interestingly fit into a historical account of events in our world just prior to, during, and a bit after WWI. I liked hearing about the struggle for self recognition and representation in the different cultures in Europe, although loosely bound, which were unfortunately based on the ancient feudal system. Frankly, I am glad that this book was a bit different from his others. Too much sameness is boring and this book was certainly not boring. I am anxious to get the next two books - on CD of course and I recommend that to you as well.   Rational Thinker
B000001A3H|5.0|The Good Bits: \\"Thumb\\", \\"Green Machine\\", \\"Thong Song\\", \\"Freedom Run\\"  The album you (the customer) are going to buy is hands down one of the best albums you never heard of in the 90's.  Sure it came about when grunge was on top of the world and it did have a sound that was similar, but you won't find angst or poppish hooks.  Instead you'll find pure power, pure skill, and pure desert rock.  Kyuss has the hooks and the riffs and everything else.  It's heavy, it's trippy, it's epic, and it's Kyuss.
0802473156|5.0|As an emerging business coach, 5 Love languages was referred to often by my coaches, not only to discuss love languages but to make the point that everyone uses many languages to relate to others.  I really enjoyed and benefited from the perspective, it is a great book to share with your life partner--we are closer than ever --did both of us reading this make a difference?  Maybe so. I took away many valuable perspectives--everyone can benefit from. There are a few books I've read recently that I feel would have helped me a better mother,spouse, and business partner. This is one--enjoy!
B003PIUC02|4.0|I've been a fan of the story of Spartacus most of my life and have seen nearly all of the historical and theatrical presentations of Spartacus's attempt to survive and then escape Roman slavery.  This version does take some liberties to expand the story, but the miniseries is very well done, production quality is excellent, and the story moves along briskly.  Be aware that this is a very dark, e.g. the '300' movie, presentation of a Roman society and a period in history that is rampant with nudity and sexual activities, with political intrigue and conniving,  and of battles with barbarian tribes and gladiatorial contests which are very graphic with lots of blood and limbs splattering about, not recommended for young children.  Once the series got going I found it both compelling and entertaining and I believe that being able to watch the series without having to wait a week for each episode makes it an even better experience.  Season 1 relates the enslavement of Spartacus (what is his real name?) and his life in the gladiatorial school and ends with the revolt and escape by Spartacus and the gladiators.  I look forward to Season II to see how much of the documented story is presented.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I'm a controller junkie and try out new ones whenever they come along.  I have a 360 and a PS3, so I'm no stranger to either's analog layout, although I've never understood the hate for Sony's Dualshock.  At any rate, everyone seems to swear by the staggered/offset analog setup of Microsoft's unit, so I decided to see if it made a difference on the PS3.    To me, a controller should feel as close to nothing in your hands as possible and it's interface should be smooth, refined and intuitive.  You play to play, not think about what's in your hands, so I'm very result oriented when I pick up any third-party unit and as far as they go, I rank them (in refinement, build quality & feel):    -Logitech  -Nyko & Thrustmaster  -Datel  -Pelican  -Gamestop (I'm sure they use various brands and slap their name on them)  -MadCatz (garbage)    This one ranks in the same category as Pelican, which is to say it's not quite as cheap and plasticky as MadCatz, but it lacks the solid feel of Nyko or Thrustmaster products. It's face buttons rattle a bit, but never get stuck or bind (and they have a springy \\"twang\\" when released). The D-pad feels clunky, but it works better than the stock XBox controller... which isn't saying much.  The analog sticks are about a third higher than first party units and the springs are stiffer, so they return to center quite forcefully.  They take a bit of getting used to.  The general shape of the controller - it's best feature, IMO - is a copy of the Logitech Precision Wireless, except it feels larger all around. The \\"diamond waffle\\" textured grip surface was a bit distracting to me, but not a deal breaker.  I'm guessing it'll be a love it or hate it feature.    All in all, it's not a bad controller for the price, except for one thing:  Dead zones.    As a decent/good - about 1.80 average - FPS player, even I can't put up with them when they cost kills in online play...  Which they did for me time and time again.    If you need a cheap(er) alternative tothe Dualshock, have whiny XBox-loving buddies over all the time or simply can't live without the staggered joystick setup when playing your RPG's, then feel free to pick one up.      ...Or just wait for the Nyko Raven.    Everyone else stick to the Dualshock or buy one of those expensive XCM 360 controller adapters.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Ok let me just be the first to say I hated the AVP movies.  They were just flat out terrible in every single way and almost ruined my love of the predator ( if you can acutally love such a butt ugly thing).  I had lost all hope and when I heard about this movie I cringed.  But, I can happilly say I was wrong.      This movie is great, a very worthy addition to the predator movies.  I have had a big gripe with the pacing in recent movies, Clash of the Titans as an example. But Predators gets it done just right.  You get the right enough of the characters backgrounds to make you understand them and see where theyre coming from.  Though its not really hard, everyone's a ruthless killer, but still they get it done.  The acting was great and no one dragged the movie down.  Yes a couple people were a little flat and some were cliched, when we see Danny Trejo in a movie we know where he's gonna end up....    Some people could say the movie was complete fanservice. Referencing the first movie, adding an old school predator and a very nice \\"in with the old and out with the new\\" to the predator style.  But what can I say Rodriguez did it right and he knew who he was trying to target.  Predator samurai fight scene complete with wavy grass anyone?       If youre a predator fan, an action movie fan, or just like seeing what crazy role Topher Grace is in now.  Check this movie out I would be greatly suprised if anyone came out disapointed.

B001FQIWSK|5.0|This is an utterly amazing film, from the first frame I was transfixed.  The performance of the little Romanian girl is perfect and so organic, I do not know how the director did this but totally real.  Lee Pace (Pushing DaIses) is also wonderful here, but it is the simple story and the extraordinary characters and humor and the eye candy cinemaphotography is wonderful, visual, and I think that it was filmed in 18 different locations like Bali, China, the UK, Spain, and many more.  The movie has it all, great looking men, great performances, great writing, great directing, a visual imagination, pathos, and everything else that I can't think of at the moment that make a great movie.  I laughed, my heart broke, I cried and then I watched it again.

B0026SCMNM|2.0|My first book on Kindle!<br /><br />I liked Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's Blackwater Lightship well-enough to give it four stars, but although Brooklyn kept me reading, I didn't like the characters and so, in the end, I didn't like the novel. To really hook me, a novel has to give me someone to like, a character to root for, and only rarely does a story lacking that win me over. Don't get me wrong -- I'll read a great novel whose characters I find unlikeable, but I won't LOVE the book.<br /><br />Brooklyn is the story of Eilis Lacey, a reluctant emigre from Ireland in the 1950s who lands in a mostly Irish and Irish-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, where she works in a department store by day and studies bookkeeping by night. The problem with Brooklyn is Eilis, who is almost entirely passive and swept this way and that by events. She lands her first job in her hometown in Ireland because the boss-lady comes looking for her. She crosses the sea because her glamorous sister, Rose, and an emigre priest cook up the plan for her relocation. Even in her secret love affair with an Italian-American man she is passive -- he doggedly pursues her -- and during a visit to Ireland she passively allows herself endanger that relationship until yet another outside force pushes her back on track. While Eilis's passivity is certainly T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point, it makes for pretty dull reading. He is, of course, a fine writer, but there's nothing he can do to make me interested in or care about a drip like Eilis Lacey.
B0020TS5LK|3.0|Very good Wesley Snipes, based on the comic book. I feel it is a most have for me.
0525951652|3.0|I enjoyed this book overall, but I will admit to selectively skimming across paragraphs that didn't add to my enjoyment or understanding of the storyline and/or characters.  Information that I found excruciatingly boring, such as the number of men stationed on a particular hill, or extended tangents about certain characters' political views, were quickly skimmed.  I'm sure some people will enjoy reading details of far too many battles, but I didn't.  However, even after skimming what probably amounted to several dozen pages, I still feel good about giving the book three stars.  In fact, I would really have preferred to give it 3 1/2 stars.    Some reviewers have commented that they didn't develop an interest in the characters, but I didn't find that to be the case for me.  Rather, I am looking forward to seeing what happens to everyone in book #2.  Someone else commented on the interjections of seemingly random sex, but I believe they were necessary to highlight the class system, as well as the characters' internal desires to push out of society's oppressive nature during that time period.  I can see how people who were expecting a straightforward novel about WWI might have been irritated by the scenes, however.
1849162751|5.0|This is the best of the Dragon Tattoo trilogy!<br /><br />I've heard this series criticized as not being great literature, and I'll agree...it's not in the high brow sense.  But as popular genre fiction, it's a blast, with each sequel building on it's predecessor and 'Hornet's Nest' exploding into a satisfying conclusion!<br /><br />The ironic thing is that Lisbeth Salander spends most of the book confined in a hospital or  prison, but even so, she's gets in the kind of action in that makes us love her!  The book is filled with twists and turns that leave the reader helplessly unable to put the book down and<br />brings a sense of completion to the whole trilogy.<br /><br />I was sad to finish because I've grown attached to the characters in the book and would love to see how they would have evolved in future volumes.<br /><br />The most fun I've had reading in a long time!
0143038583|3.0|This book contains three essays, each a few chapters long. The first essay decries the evils of industrial agriculture, both conventional and organic, which are not very different; in order to enter an organic chicken operation, you need to wear a hazmat suit, since the chickens are not fed antibiotics. The complaints are well-known: industrial agriculture consumes too much fossil fuel; it is ecologically damaging; it produces unhealthy food such as high-fructose corn syrup; ruminants have evolved to digest grass, and feeding them maize ruins their health and harms the health of humans eating them. All of it is well-known in the greenie-hippie circles, but I am glad that this criticism is moving into the mainstream through bestsellers such as this book and Fast Food Nation. What is missing from the discussion is the question, how to feed 6.7 billion humans without industrialized agriculture using synthetic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. The second essay describes a Virginia farmer who raises chicken, pigs and cattle using original integrated grazing techniques; for example, he grazes cows and allows flies to lay eggs into the cow patties; when the larvae develop, his chicken happily eat them. The working of his farm, which incorporates several feedback cycles, reminded me of a Generation III nuclear reactor with passive safety features. In the third essay the author tells about his hunting and mushroom gathering experiences, and the preparation of anti-fast food from the gathered ingredients.

067960085X|4.0|I'm planning to read Sam Wasson's new book [[ASIN:0061774154 Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.: Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the Dawn of the Modern Woman]].  To get there, I first read Truman Capote's original story.  Next up, viewing of Blake Edwards' 1961 film.  Then, on to Wasson's book.<br /><br />The three additional stories here are of little weight and value - it's 'Breakfast' that is Capote's slim masterpiece. Its 119 small, generously spaced pages can be easily gulped down in a single setting.<br /><br />Like 'Catcher in the Rye,' the reader is left amazed that these words were conceived and written 50+ years ago (original publication date: 1958) so vibrant do they feel.  Capote's original incarnation makes much plainer than the book the nature of Holly's true vocation.  And, contrary to Audrey Hepburn's gauzy, iconographic screen beauty, Capote's Ms. Golightly is, while lithe, of coarser and tougher stock.  When my wife asked me my opinion after finishing it, my immediate reaction was that it was sadder and darker than I expected.<br /><br />Capote's writing is a marvel.  As Norman Mailer's cover blurb notes: Capote was - at one point - seen as the best writer of his generation.  It's hard not to read these pages and think of his blazing start as a young writer and juxtapose that against the parody he'd become later in life.  He abused and wasted his talent through prodigious consumption of drugs and alcohol, not to mention a well-honed talent for blowing up important friendships with his thinly disguised literary send-ups.

1400097029|3.0|I came to this novel via Banville's pseudonymous crime fiction as Benjamin Black. He is a terrific writer in both guises, but I have to say I like the minor Black fiction more. I want a bit more plot than is on offer here in the story of a recent widower who returns to the seaside village where he spent his summers and the guest cottage where the Graces, a family who drew him into their circle, stayed one fateful summer. The Grace twins are obnoxious little terrors, their father a creepy blowhard and their mother the enigmatic object of young Max Morden's desire, which is the only reason I can imagine the boy would want to hang out with this crew. The adult Max is a whiner and not that appealing himself. I totally did not anticipate the big surprise that comes at the end of adult Max's story, and I found Banville's decision to employ a slew of very obscure, however precise, words a truly obnoxious affectation that showed more regard for his own cleverness than for his readers.
B000QKS3GC|5.0|It's rare when a movie delivers such a powerful lesson in history as this one.  I'd not been aware of the White Rose non-violent resistance to the Nazi regime until seeing this film.  Indeed, the full story of White Rose hadn't been known until original source material surfaced after the fall of East Germany in late 1989.<br /><br />What struck me was the sheer bravery of the movement's young leaders, the brilliantly staged rendition of the Nazi show trial that followed their arrests and the finality of the quick, shocking punishment that is meted out.  In particular, the show trial scene is movie-making of the highest order with a knockout Downfall-esque performance by Andr&eacute; Hennicke as Richter Dr. Roland Freisler.  The production design, too, is worthy of special note - the courtroom in the trial scene is spectacularly staged.<br /><br />The film also serves as evidence that not all Germans marched in enthusiastic lockstep to the Nazi war machine.  Reviews accompanying the film's 2005 release relate that German audiences reacted very positively to the film, perhaps because it demonstrated the courage and dissent alive in the populace at that time.  Stars Julia Jentsch and Fabian Hinrichs (as Sophie's brother Hans) beautifully convey the passion, innocence and bravery of the Scholls.<br /><br />It was only six days between arrest and conclusion.  The movie does a great job at conveying a rush to judgment that mocks the idea of jurisprudence.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|I likely have little substance to add to previous reviews on the book itself. Well written, explains extraordinarily difficult concepts well with good use of mental models, and even manages to inject occasional humor into a difficult topic.  That said, it is extremely disappointing that Amazon and the editors would release an e-book where every graphic and subtitle has a portion of the left margin cut off on the Kindle screen. If this was a hardcopy book, I'd be returning it for a new one. Unfortunately, that's not an option for the Kindle.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|The theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven was a good movie, although I did felt back then, that character development and motivations were not well explained; for instance Balian (Orlando Bloom) joining the Crusade seems too rush and also when Sibylla (Eva Green) leaves behind Jerusalem, I couldn't but feel that something was missing.    I did had high expectations of the Director's cut since adds around half an hour to this film, the first thing that caught my interest was the fact that Eva Green's character has a son, and basically all scenes that involve this child were deleted to make it more commercially viable. The extended content brings so much to the story that truly is like a different movie, and a better one.    Director's cut version on blu-ray is a magnificent release and I would highly recommend it to anyone that had the slightest interest on the theatrical release.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|I can't believe I never heard of this movie until it popped up as a recommended title on a movie rental site I subscribe to. This is a beautifully-made period/ historical drama which is set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria. The central character in this story is Hypatia (played by Rachel Weisz) a renowned female scholar who taught philosophy, astronomy, and mathematics. Though Hypatia is beautiful and desirable to males (having many male admirers), she is quite oblivious to this effect she has on men, preferring to immerse herself in scholarly pursuits.<br /><br />Some of her male admirers are Davus (Max Minghella), who happens to be her slave; there's the Christian student, Synesius (Rupert Evans); and finally, the openly admiring Orestes (Oscar Isaac) who declares his love for Hypatia during a public gathering - her reaction to this? By offering him a 'token' in the form of a rag smeared with her menstrual blood, a blatant and obvious message of rejection. There are more serious things explored in this drama than romantic pursuits. Alexandria is in the midst of a serious conflict between the pagan aristocracy to which Hypatia and her father belong, and the rising Christian militant movement called the Parabolani. The Jews are sort of caught in the middle, and the divisions between the upper and lower classes, as well as slaves, further exacerbates the situation.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of years, and the library at Alexandria is now a holding pen for animals - a man named Cyril is the Patriarch of Alexandria, i.e. the leader of the Church; Orestes has converted to Christianity and is the Imperial Prefect of Alexandria, he is also dependent on Hypatia for her advice and appears to have set aside her rejection of him in the past; Synesius has risen to the position of Bishop; and Davus has joined the Parabolani. Hypatia continues to teach, though in a much diminished capacity - she also continues to fervently study the planets and their movement. Little does she realize the very real threat posed to her by the increasingly militant Christians who perceive her as a threat both because of her paganism and the influence she wields over the Prefect Orestes who is frequently at odds with Cyril.<br /><br />I'm not sure as to how much of this movie is period authentic, but I was impressed by the quality of the sets, and the direction. The acting was also above average - Rachel Weisz was incredible in her role as the strong-willed scholar who was way ahead of her time in terms of being a respected female scholar, and in the way she thought not only about astronomy but also about faith ( in one insightful dialogue between Hypatia and Synesius, she says, \\"You do not question your beliefs, but I must.\\").<br /><br />Is this movie anti-Christian? I do not believe so - I think it portrays the events (based on whatever sources are still available) as they occurred during that period. Both the militant Christians, the black-robed Parabolani, and the Jews are depicted as being in conflict with each other -acts of stoning abound in this movie (must have been the favorite method of retaliation at the time?). More interestingly, I looked at this movie as depicting the conflict between religion and science, an age-old conflict that persists to this day. How much do we take on faith, and how much of science can truly explain all there is to be explained? Hypatia's theories about the movement of the planets was considered blasphemous, against Church teachings, yet time proved her theories had merit. I prefer to think of this movie as a thought-provoking drama that makes one ponder about the relationship between man, faith, and science.the very real threat posed to her by the increasingly militant Christians who perceive her as a threat both because of her paganism and the influence she wields over the Prefect Orestes who is frequently at odds with Cyril.

0060730552|5.0|Even though I've never (and will never) climbed a snow covered mountain, I find myself drawn to books that chronicle man's attempt to survive climbing disasters.  A friend recommended I read Touching the Void: The True Story of One Man's Miraculous Survival by Joe Simpson, one of the first books of that type.  It was a riveting read, with the story being written and told in the first person by the survivor of a accident that should have killed him.  What he did to survive was nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, decided to make an ascent on Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes.  At 21000 feet, this was no small mountain, but they traveled light, with only one additional person to keep watch on the camp while they made the climb.  What should have been a three day ascent turned into a nightmare when Simpson fell and broke his leg while on the descent.  Given the large number of crevasses and cliffs, his odds of making it down were slim, but Yates did what he could to get them both down.  During a maneuver in the midst of a storm, Simpson went over a cliff and had no way to communicate that to his partner who was on the other end of the rope.  Yates was unaware of the specific details of Simpson's predicament, but he knew he couldn't continue to support the weight of them both forever.  As he slowly lost his leverage, he had to make a decision... continue holding on and they would both fall and die, or cut the rope and send Simpson to an almost certain death.  He made the right decision by climbing standards and cut the rope, and then started his own painful and haunted descent back to base camp.<br /><br />Once the rope was cut, Simpson plummeted to the snow field below, landing on his back briefly before the landing spot collapsed into a crevasse and he fell again.  That should have killed him, especially given the state of his leg and knee.  But amazingly he survived that fall with no additional injuries, and then started a slow, painful journey to base camp.  He did this with no food, water, or shelter, and only had a single leg to rely upon, as his other leg was now nothing but a useless appendage full of pain.  By crawling, hopping, and sliding over a number of days, he was able to arrive back in camp, nearly dead and the day before they were going to pack up and head back to Lima.<br /><br />What struck me most about Touching the Void was how the will to survive can push us beyond limits that most of us couldn't even begin to imagine.  Simpson does an excellent job in capturing the mental and physical pain he endured, and it was hard not to be affected by his writing.  This book should definitely be on the reading list of anyone who climbs or is fascinated by men facing the limits of physical endurance and pushing through them.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedl journey to base camp.

B003R0LBVW|1.0|I raised my family in Jonathan Franzen's Webster Groves, Missouri, hometown.  My children went to the same schools. I'm supposed to love this book, but, along with The Corrections, I hated it.  I kept with it for about a third of the book and I actually liked the beginning.  But, as the book developed, when it became clear that I was going to have to follow the same self-absorbed characters to the end, I put it down in disgust.  There is no love in this book; there are no functional relationships with neighbors, families, children. There is no emphasis on or even acknowledgment of principles that give life and relationships value. The characters display no character and following their demise into moral suicide was not my idea of a good read.  I don't know what world Johathan Franzen grew up in, but this is not my world.  Which brings me to my biggest question for those heavyweight New York Times, Time magazine reviewers (and Oprah too)...is this the world YOU think we live in?  Do you really think this book reflects our society, as I have read repeatedly?  No wonder there is such a disconnect in our America.
B003YOZNBK|1.0|I will get right to the point! The movie may be fantastic, but I never got to see it because of the  never-ending PIP that seemed to be embedded into the disk. I tried for over an hour try to disable  the PIP but to know avail. I also have to say there is nothing on the \\"Special Features\\" tab when the movie starts that allows the viewer to accomplish this. I advised Amazon.com of this problem  and they gave me a refund. Finally, I would ask the manufactuer of this disk to correct the problem if they want the public to buy and watch the movie.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|First of all, I like the packaging, somewhat similar to the Beatles mono set but the quality and detail is not as good as the Beatles box, IMO.  I have been listening to this set and comparing them to the remastered stereo releases.  The listening I have done has been in my car which has Bose speakers.  I have mixed feelings about some of the records.       The Bob Dylan and Times album were remastered and released in 05, and as I have read they were the mono recordings.  Upon comparison they sound exactly the same to me.  I give the edge to mono with the Freewheelin' album.  The stereo is just fine and seems to be \\"louder\\" but there is a little more warmth and depth with the mono album.  The separation from left to right is noticeable on stereo but its not the worst thing in the world.  For Bringing it all Back Home I prefer the stereo (to my surprise).  The stereo just \\"popped\\" in the speakers compared to mono.  Also, I didn't care for the reverb on Dylan's voice on Tambourine Man, too much echo.  I kind of feel the same way about HWY61.  I just didn't care for the mono version of Like a Rolling Stone.  I felt that is sounded too muted or muddy compared to stereo.  Even though the stereo has some left/right separation its not that bad.  Again, in the car the stereo version just pops out of the speakers, mono didn't.  I really like BOB in mono, no question.  The same goes for JWH, way better in mono.  Overall, I found that I liked the stereo a little better but mono has its good parts too.  I would recommend the mono and now that you can buy them individually on Itunes I would recommend: Freewheeling, Blonde on Blonde, and John Wesley Harding.  Also the first album and Times if you don't have the remastered versions.

0812973992|5.0|It took me so long to get through the first half of this book but the second half, when McCann starts to bring all of the characters together, is where it gets so profound and amazing and moving that it will probably change my life.  I think the author is so ambitious in the number of characters he tries to weave into the story (something like 11 characters I believe) that I realized, looking back, that he needed all of those first chapters to give each character life.  When I got to the second half and had the ah-ha moment of seeing all of those characters and their lives intersect, it was like putting together an impossible 5,000 piece puzzle - so incredibly rewarding and meaningful.  It's like life itself, really.  How it takes time, and sometimes sadness, and sometimes patience to create a deep relationship with someone, but then doing that gets you to a place of incredible beauty.  I am so glad I read this book.  And I have to say that the epilogue McCann wrote is one of the most poignant pieces of writing I have ever seen.

B003TML0VO|1.0|I am an avid music collector and have been a devout follower of Santana since I was a teenager in the 70's. For most of my life I have followed Santana. I have seen the band live countless times; collected all kinds of Santana memorabilia and believe he is a living guitar legend. I own over 30 Santana titles and they are some of my favorite cds.<br />When \\"Supernatural\\" came out I stepped away. I felt it and \\"Shaman\\" (and others like it) were a sure way to make money; but they weren't true to the original sound or focus. All that was Santana has been diluted by doing nothing but repeated \\"successful\\" guest artists cameo cd's that pander to the crossmarket that follows those \\"guests\\". And how many more Santana compilations/Greatest hits packages can be released? Lost is the orginality that made so many Santana albums a delight to listen to again and again. Yes many of those classics were covers as well...but they didn't seem designed to market.<br />And now this? A cover of guitar classics! We are the people that grew up with these to begin with. Classics are just that; they aren't meant to be covered and certainly not by someone who shared the era with them. Should Deep Purple cover \\"Everybody's Everything?\\", AC/DC \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" and the Stones \\"Evil Ways?\\" I hope not. This is just pure sell out.<br />Even if you want to shoot for the top 40 market you could still remember your orginal audience and humor us with an occasional orginal release...maybe an instrumental cd, vintage live releases (instead of \\"greatest hits\\") or just something from your heart. We're still out here waiting...
1582701709|3.0|This is a great 'feel good' book.

Though the book does offer some insights on more useful ways of thinking, it does not give you adequate information to change the deeper level of thought (the unconscious level).<br /><br />The only value of surface level 'feel good' thinking is in the good feelings it tends to generate at that moment, and the potential for the change of your deeper thinking (the UC mind).  In my experience though, most people don't manage to change the deeper structures of their mind with simple, surface level thought.<br /><br />It also doesn't adequately address the importance of taking action... if you aren't taking action, you aren't likely to change anything significantly in your life... your actions must be congruent with your desires.<br /><br />This is a feel good book, though, and I do find it to be valuable in that capacity.  Changing how you feel right now is much easier than most people make it out to be... and the book did help me to feel good as I read it.<br /><br />If you decide to use this book for your own transformation or for achieving your goals, I highly encourage you to find additional tools to more effectively influence the deeper levels of your mind.

B002ZG98LO|3.0|Glancing at the other reviews, it's apparent that most people have a 'love it or hate it' attitude toward this film.  Both extremes generally seem to spring from the sincere appreciation of the first 'Predator' film, if not the entire franchise - if the 'Predator' films, any or all, are one of your sacred cows, then you may also find yourself 'loving or hating it'.  I certainly enjoyed both 1 and 2 for the type of film that they were (I might even give 2 an edge over the original because Danny Glover is a better actor than Schwarzenegger), and thought AVP was, at best, a weaker effort, but 'Predators' is EXACTLY the same as those others - fun in some ways, weak in others, and neither the worst piece of garbage ever, nor a five star action classic.    Eight people wake up in free-fall, chutes opening automatically just in time.  Most of the eight are heavily armed, though some are not, and all are suspicious of the other while attempting to find out where they are and why.  Eventually, they discover that they have been brought to an alien planet - which functions as a game reserve - to be hunted by the race of Predators.  That's about all there is to it - will they survive or not?    Simple plots can make fun and entertaining movies - this is no exception.  There's no heavy lifting here - most of the movie plays out the way one might expect, and even the surprises are unveiled in unsurprising ways.  In a not-so-subtle subtext, these eight, whom we discover are all predators themselves, albeit in the normal Homo Sapien visciousness that we've come to know and love, are put in a situation where they must decide if they are all hunter, as the Predators are, or whether any shred of humanity is left within them.      That's the good part.  However, 'Predator' has faults that can't be ignored.  A film like this depends for its success on creating a fantasy that is coherent enough and quick enough to keep the viewers from shaking off his willingness to go along with it.  One such moment that fails this simple test is when the band of humans walk for hours, under clear skies, and then emerge at a cliff-side and only then notice several other planets hanging over three-quarters of the sky.  This isn't a terrible fault, but the film has to work to get me back after that.   More serious is the modern action film stereotype of the hard-as-nails female, even if played well here by Alice Braga.  I don't have a problem with a strong female character (I think there are few better action leads, male or female, than Sigourney Weaver in 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but too often these characters strike me as a sop to special interest groups.  I am absolutely positive there are women like the one in 'Predators' - but it's their de rigueur appearance I object to.    A stronger fault of the film is a missed opportunity - while Lawrence Fishburne has lost the edginess I thought he had in films like 'The King of New York', his screen time is cut way too short here as he does an excellent job with what he's given - and the same can be said for the always impressive Danny Trejo.  Cuchillo, we hardly knew ya.  And the subplot involving the Topher Grace character comes to an untimely conclusion, or else it's that Topher Grace always seems a bit silly to me, and his involvement simply can't be taken seriously.       But this film ultimately fails to be all it can be with the choice of Adrian Brody as the lead.  Whether or not anyone accepts this film will hinge on whether they can accept the artificially gravel-voiced Brody as an amoral mercenary tough guy.  Forget comparisons to Arnold - it doesn't have anything to do with that.  Brody just does not have it within his repertoire to play this kind of character.  He can certainly do action films - 'King Kong' proved that - but he's out of his depth here.       Even though 'Predators' is only entertainment, it still should be true to itself.  With a different lead, it might have been worth another half or even full star, but Brody just can't pull his bulked up weight here (I would have liked to have seen Danny Trejo in the lead).  Three stars, but still some fun.

This movie more that made up for any shortcomings from Flags.  This movie went out of it's way in developing the characters; showing them in their pre-war lives as well.  Also, for those of us that love great battle action, this movie will not disappoint!

B003ZJJFKE|3.0|I have been a fan of guitar guys like Malmsteen, Gilbert, Vai and Satriani since the 80s.<br /><br />This new Satriani CD was good for a single listen, but when it was over I knew I would never listen to it again and gave it away to a friend.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well first of all, 4 of the songs sounds identical.<br />Same basic chord progressions, same tempo, same key center, scales, modes and melodies.<br />Almost like they were variations on a theme.<br /><br />But more importantly, nothing was memorable or catchy.<br /><br />Yes, it was proficient and skilled.<br />Certainly well played and technically sound.<br /><br />But nothing \\"grabbed\\" my attention and made me WANT to listen to it again and again and again.<br /><br />You know how some CDs just grab you and maybe you even find yourself humming some of the harmonies or melodies days later ??<br /><br />There was nothing like that on this album.<br />After it was finished playing, I realized my mind had wandered to other things while it was playing and I could not recall a single line when it was over.<br /><br />I guess I am trying to say .. \\"It left no lasting impression\\".<br /><br />I hope my friend enjoys it more.
B003YK42LQ|2.0|I'm disappointed. The album sounds pretty unoriginal and boring. Maybe it will grow on me with future listens. I was hoping for something so much more gripping and interesting. It will probably hold a similar skip-over place in my collection, not unlike the \\"Adore\\" album from Smashing Pumpkins.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue is the third in the computer animated series and for our family the best yet. The quality of the animation, storytelling and music is far more than what direct-to-video tends to offer. Four generations of our family have all watched and loved the story. It entertains the children but never bores Mom and Dad. Great grandma may love it more than the kids, what more can you ask? It teaches the value of friendship, family and the need to never stop believing in the unbelievable.
0143118420|5.0|The book came in good time and good condition. I was given a 2 week window for delivery and it arrived in about 6 days. I already had an idea about the book after having seen the movie--the book was much more interesting. I recommend it to all. Liz Gilbert is a very engaging, thoughtful writer. Enjoy.
0500543933|2.0|How do you separate your enthusiasm for a book's content from your dismay over the authors' publishing ethics. I think this is a great book. It has wonderful photos and absorbing essays on each photographer. It masterfully portrays the unique genre of street photography and the aesthetic choices photographers who roam the streets make. The problem is, it doesn't properly cite specific content that originally appeared in a well-known street photography blog [...]. Although the site is listed in the book's bibliography, quotes from the site are republished without appropriate citation. Had I known this beforehand, I might not have bought the book. And now that I have the book, my enthusiasm for it is somewhat dimmed.

0374158460|3.0|Long book that follows Walter and Patty Berglund over many years and many tribulations.   I did finish the book and somewhat enjoyed it, but all along the way, there always seems to have been something that I wasn't convinced of.       Patty was set up as being efficient and unpleasant and unloveable......I was told that but not convincingly shown.  A large portion of the book was her 'autobiography/confession,' yet it was written in the same voice as the rest of the book.  Confusing.     The son hates Patty........because they'd been very close and because she'd favored him over her daughter????  Really?    Walter and Patty allow the same 16-year-old son to move in with neighbors they strongly dislike, where he shares a bed with their 16-year-old daughter?   Really?  Both sets of parents allow that?      The son grows up, supposedly super-handsome and charming, yet he ends up with the same super-clingy girl whose personality reads like that of a depressive mushroom.    The rock star Richard Katz spends part of the book obsessed with Patty....and then not.  Walter starts out as a very agreeable environmentalist milquetoast...then he's suddenly an aggressive a**hole who helps promote mountain top removal under the guise of saving an obscure bird (the cerulean warbler).   Huh?    How did that happen?  At the end, Patty seems (to me) to be exhibiting the same characteristics that she did in the beginning of the book.   At the beginning, they seemed to make people hate her; at the end, the behaviors make people love her and accept Walter.  As I said, a somewhat enjoyable book......but I remain unconvinced about several things.  I read this book during a week that I took off work.  I also read \\"Star Island\\" and \\"Room,\\" each of which I enjoyed much more.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I grew up listening to classical music and also playing classical music. Though I have also always liked pop music very much, I never imagined there would come a time when I would reach the point of literally *falling in love* with a pop artist. Never,... until I saw a Michael Jackson video (Dangerous) for the first time. I was in awe. That was about twenty years ago but his limitless talent and his unique charisma, his jaw-dropping performances, his admirable singing abilities were more than I would have ever expected from ANY performer. For different reasons, I never had the chance to see MJ live, but I had the hope that there would come a day when I would be one of the lucky ones standing in the audience at one of MJ's live concerts somewhere in the world. I had been hoping for Michael to return to the stage and, once more, awe the world with his rare talent. It could not happen. More than a year has passed since Michael's passing but I have not been able to come to terms with his death. He was too special.  I am so glad and so thankful to have been able to have this great video. As soon as \\"This is it\\" became available I got it on DVD. Just recently I also got another copy on blu-ray and I am thinking of getting a third one, just in case. Had Michael had the chance to go on his \\"This is it\\" tour, it would have been a wonderful show. It didn't happen, and this saddens me deeply. Michael was a very special human being and, as an artist, had a talent like no other. He was the best pop artist that ever lived, he is and will *always* be the best. This video comes to prove that, at almost 50 years of age, Michael was ready, once again, to charm and inspire the whole world. I will never find the words to describe my admiration for this phenomenal artist, for this special man. Love you always, Michael.

I could not believe the wealth of knowledge it holds and for the price you can get it makes me wish I had bought it sooner. The look and the feel of the Bible are both beautifully done. ESV is an outstanding translation as well. Well worth the investment for your growing faith. God bless.

I have carried it all over the house, in and out of the car and   read until late into the night.  It gives a very accurate account of life in and out of the trenches in Europe at the start of the 20th Century and during World War I.  I am looking forward to the remaining two books in this trilogy.

B002ZG98LO|5.0|The movie was funny and entertaining.  Reading some of these negative reviews is rather amusing. \\"The script was so juvenile and unintelligent...\\" Um, \\"GET TO THE CHOPPA!!!\\" yeah that's some great writing, truly a paradigm shift in cinema lol.  The plot in this film was straight forward and the characters were fairly well developed.  Comparisons to Cube, Hypercube, etc are interesting since Hypercube in my mind is the definition of unintelligent, saying words like fourth dimension, hypercube, theoretical mathematician, theoretical physicist, etc yet giving no meaning to those words since the author didn't know anything except the word itself.  This much is obvious just from the \\"oh you made it through? bang your dead. the end\\" , having to think of an ending let a lone a coherent plot nah that's too much work...So anyways!!! Predators! Great movie! :)
B0037FFBCW|5.0|The film is wonderful, but I wanted to reach out to those viewers who are questionable about the DVD itself.  I bought this title for my birthday (it came today, on my actual birthday) and I only realized later that it had Korean text.  I was worried about two things: first, that it would be a bootleg quality film or that it would be entirely in Korean.  This is not true.  This is a DVD that will work in any region and it has optional subtitles for English/Korean/French and its languages are French and English.  The DVD is just like one you would buy in a big box store.  So if you were hesitant about purchasing the DVD due to quality concerns then worry no more.  It's a great DVD and there is nothing wrong with it other than the fact the box text is in Korean.  The film, of course, is great as well.
B003UESJJC|3.0|I love this movie and it looks great on Blu-ray. Seeing Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando in a movie made over 30 years ago looking like they filmed it last year (it was that well re-mastered) was a truly mind-boggling experience. BUT, there seems to be an error in disc 2 in the Additional Scenes section. All of the scenes are cut off in the screen, you can only see the bottom 4th of the screen and the rest is blacked out, clearly a mistake, but other features on the disc are fine. Did anyone else experience this???
B002ZG981E|5.0|This film is a modern masterpiece.  How does one brain write and direct such rich content? I cannot imagine the hours spent nutting this one out.  The film gives me great hope that Hollywood is capable of producing films of complexity and depth.

Every DVD has bonus features, bonus scenes, bloopers, along with a commentary for each episode (a rarity to even get a handful of commentaries).

B000LB7G00|5.0|This was an easy 5-star to give.  The SpaceNavigator gets as much use as my mouse.  Yeah, really.  You wouldn't think so until you get one to go along with 3D development environments (SecondLife, Maya, Google Earth, others).  If I had to summarize what it's like to use, it's like a complete flight-simulator in your left hand.  Push down, you go down; pull up, you go up; twist it and you turn; push left right back and forth and you go those directions.  You can even control the rate of motion.  After using it for a day in a 3D environment it's almost like thinking and you see the motion happen in front of you.<br /><br />For SecondLife users, you can move your avatar naturally.  None of that \\"bumping into doorways\\" thing.  Click the side button and you start moving the in-world camera like you've got it in the nose of a helicopter.  For users of 3D modeling systems, you gain that same easy camera motion for looking at your models and scenarios.  Google Earth is a fun free thing that uses SpaceNavigator and you just fly yourself around.<br /><br />What's crazy fun is to use the mouse and the SpaceNavigator simultaneously.<br /><br />I've used it with photoshop, but frankly it's a bit robust a tool to use with Photoshop.  Perhaps a bit like getting a swiss army knife when the only thing you really need is a screwdriver.<br /><br />There are games available that take advantage of the SpaceNavigator, but they aren't any that I own currently, so I can't comment on how it works with them yet.  Maybe later I can come back and add a video review that shows the SpaceNavigator in action.<br /><br />[followup]<br />I returned to edit my review. It was quite nice of Amazon to let me know that I convinced another person to get one of these. The manufacturer officially owes me one *grin*. Since I originally reviewed space navigator, Blender (the free 3D modeling program) went through a life-changing revision and this is a great too for that application.<br /><br />So, the groove is there. Those of us fans of FPS games need to get game makers to support the 3D mouse. Imagine playing Half-life or Bioshock (sure... version 3 of both) where your left hand fluently moves your character via 3D mouse and your right hand uses the conventional mouse to aim and shoot. How more real is that? The future is at our fingertips: does anyone besides me see it?is there. Those of us fans of FPS games need to get game makers to support the 3D mouse.

B000002LAB|5.0|I own about 90 Miles Davis CDs and have read maybe 1/2 dozen biographies and his autobiography.  I know this man reasonably well even though I never met him.  I feel qualified to render a highly informed opinion on any of his works.  It is all about taste people.  Miles Davis NEVER made crappy, substandard music.  Tutu is great music... but it's all about taste and context when it comes to opinions and review.  Here goes:<br /><br />We all know the story about how Miles failed to read the fine print for his new Warner Bros contract and had to revolt in order to protect the latter years of his compositional legacy from default ownership by Warner Bros.  Davis brought in Marcus Miller to write and arrange all but one piece (Backyard Ritual).  The resulting music is very poppy funk that has a lot going on \\"up inside of it\\" (to quote one of the Man's lines).  The arrangements are first class, very nice.  Again, I've said elsewhere that Miles (like Joe Zawinul) relied far to much on synthesizers to set up his \\"big band\\" sound (that is in fact what he said he was trying to achieve with these instruments) and today much of that music has a great big ol' 80's decal stuck on it.  Compare this to Miles' other work sans synthesizers whether it be his work in the 50's or up through the mid 70's, that music all sounds timeless.  This is because electronic instruments are continuously improved upon and new sounds become \\"fads\\" (e.g., the sort of \\"breathy\\" pan-pipes used on Tutu) and we all know what happens to fads... the same thing that happened to all the paisley shirts, Nehru jackets, and mullet cuts each in their own time.  They got old and out dated.  Never the less, Tutu gets 5 stars from me.  It isn't my favorite Miles' by a country mile ;) but, this is very well crafted music and the playing is strong.  How can I not give it 5 stars?  I hope the sound grows on me a bit.  Really, I guess I feel a bit like those fans in 1970 when Bitches Brew was released, you know, the ones who were shocked and said \\"say it ain't so Miles?\\"  Tutu is a return to contemporary sounds, unfortunately, it's a contemporary sound that quickly became dated due to the continuously forward march of technology.  It's still very good music people. For die hard Miles enthusiasts it's just in the wrong context for their ears - mostly.  Consequently we have to put on a different set of ears to appreciate the magnificence of Tutu.  Next up: Amandla!  Go Miles!  Go Miles!  It's your birthday, Go Miles!re shocked and said \\"say it ain't so Miles?\\"  Tutu is a return to contemporary sounds, unfortunately, it's a contemporary sound that quickly became dated due to the continuously forward march of technology.

0596805888|5.0|A fellow computer geek from SecondLife recommended this book to me, and what a cookbook it is.  It's nearly impossible to write a book on cooking basics, yet at the same time put in things to satisfy even experienced cooks, but this book has it all.<br /><br />One thing you must keep in mind is that some of the humor might get lost on you.  That \\"u can haz cheezburger\\" might be a mis-spelling to some in the section on making burgers, it's a great inside joke to others.  (I need to go back and check the book to see if it says \\"I made you a cookie, but I eated it.\\")  To the sheer delight of both geeks and innovative cooks, many warrantee-voiding hacks to kitchen equipment are presented (like how to turn your home oven into a serious pizza oven).  There a many very good interviews with all sorts of experts in cooking and science related fields (including Adam Savage of \\"Mythbusters\\" fame).<br /><br />But the section of the book that blew my mind was the whole food chemistry section.  And I don't just mean good general knowledge about protein chains or Maillard reaction that you'd learn on shows like \\"Good Eats\\" (not that \\"Cooking for Geeks\\" doesn't have that, too), but I mean bizarre things like \\"meat glue\\" and unusual jelling agents and maltodextrin+oil combinations.  As a result that chapter, I've ordered [[ASIN:B001TJOL24 Experimental Kit Texturas]] so look for my review of that after I get it.<br /><br />I'm already planning this book as a Christmas gift for a few people.

B003YOZNBU|3.0|JONAH HEX is not too bad of a film. Maybe the movie-going public isn't ready, or the time isn't right for yet another, sort of, \\"Revisionist-Western-Film\\".  If one can call it that. The movie is an excercise in film-making, taking a relatively unknown comic-book anti-hero from the stable of DC Comics' characters, and giving it the Hollywood treatment. This reviewer is also a DC Comics fan, but only knows of the \\"Jonah Hex\\" character when he appeared in various \\"guest-starring\\" roles of other various DC Comics Universe comic books in \\"time-travel-back-to-the-old-west\\" stories (i.e JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA), and maybe picked up and thumbed through a couple of issues JONAH HEX or WEIRD WESTERN TALES comics over the years --(In fact, if one is to pick up the current DC Comics mini-series BATMAN: THE RETURN OF BRUCE WAYNE/ISSUE NO.4, Jonah Hex makes an appearance in that!). What makes the film stand out is pretty good casting. Josh Brolin in the title role does an excellent job and is well cast. John Malkovich plays Quentin Turnbull, Jonah Hex's antagonist. Malkovish usually plays (many-a)villians a bit over-the-top, but plays Turnbull pretty much restrained (but still evil). Other surprises in the cast are Tom (THE DUKES OF HAZARD) Wopat, Will Arnett in a non-comedic role as a Civil War Union Officer, the always reliable Aiden Quinn as President Ulysses S. Grant, and Michael Fassbender (so unrecognisable from his Lt. Hicox role in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS) as 'Burk', Turnbull's right-hand-henchman. The plot mixes elements of adventure, revenge, horror, romance, Amercian History, and modern themes of \\"weapons-of-mass-destruction\\" in an old-west background and is a little predictable but entertaining nontheless. The movie length itself is slightly under 90 minutes so, [they] didn't try to make it an epic-type-western. The production values of the film are just right (the Jonah Hex make-up on Josh Brolin is pretty seamless). Overall, a film worth a look if one has 80 minutes to kill (and if your a male, it's worth a look if one wants to see Megan Fox playing the saloon girl/prostitute with a heart-of-gold, Tallulah Black).to kill (and if your a male, it's worth a look if one wants to see Megan Fox playing the saloon girl/prostitute with a heart-of-gold, Tallulah Black).
B00007K02F|5.0|This movie tells the story of Jane Eyre beautifully; if not perfectly word-for-word matched to the book, it communicates the classic story in a manner that is both true, effective, and beautiful.  Bronte's story was one filled with pain and suffering, balanced by unspeakable joy and love; this film captures that (if I may be so bold as to speak for a world-class author who lived some two hundred years ago) just as she would have liked.  Gainsbourg portrays Jane Eyre with brilliancy: the gentle and compassionate schoolteacher/governess is harmonious with the passionate spirit, honest tongue, and fierce determination that Charlotte Bronte so masterfully implanted into her unusual heroine.<br />A word of caution to those who may prefer action movies and plots that rush along at ten thousand miles per hour:  This is a thought-provoking film and an intriguing mystery, and while there is a touch of the thrilling, it is NOT an action movie, and there are no swords. Sorry :(<br /><br />This movie goes well with a few of your girlfriends, a cozy blanket, a soft couch, and a big bowl of ice cream; you will enjoy it!!!

B004132I4S|5.0|Don't really like to compare albums, really, but when an artist like Sufjan Stevens (of whom I'm a fan, obviously) gets all kinds of acclaim and equal boo's, I can't help but assert my own opinion as to where I believe the adulation or lack thereof deserves to be placed.<br /><br />To make a potentially rambling personal review short but still hopefully convincing, I say to you skeptical listeners out there - Listen to this album more than twice!! It gets better with each spin. The musical layers and lyrical musings begin to dance with each other just when it seems like they have no footing.<br /><br />Like the Illinois album, this one also embraces musical ideas of grandeur. But where Illinois is more tightly wound together in a bouquet of musical-esque splendor, Age of Adz seems to take the big sound in Illinois and dismantle it and give it a home here in the \\"age of digital\\" with synthesized sounds reminiscent of the 80's, along with instrumentation so perfectly placed within and around each theme, that only someone with the appellation of \\"composer\\" could be worthy of accomplishing. And that's gotta be our man here, Sufjan Stevens.<br /><br />Key tracks - I Walked, Vesuvius, Too Much, Age of Adz, Impossible Soul, and Futile Devices.
B0045XICB2|5.0|Unlike  a lot of the reviews I have read on the Twilight series I have to say that I loved Eclipse!  As an older individual I refused to read the series,  but finally my friend talked me into buying the  first book (Twilight).  From the first book until the fourth I was definitely hooked.  I have read every book and have watched the first two DVD's at least four times.  Each time I read the books or watch the DVD's I see something new.  I love the series, I just wish she would write the last book from Edward's perspective?

B003VS0CWO|3.0|Having owned several 35mm prints of this film and watched many others, I know how this film should look.  Overall, this disc looks amazing with intact grain structure and details; however there are 2 major issues.    1.  For unknown reasons Science Fiction is LETTERBOXED ( within the 1.66 frame which the Fox logo and the rest of the film is in), cutting off the top and bottom of the lips during parts of the song.  The entire film was 1.66 on the dvd so this blunder on the Blu-ray is unforgivable.  2.  The blue tint from Brad's bedroom scene has been removed.  The blue tint from the Timewarp flashback has also been removed.    I have emailed FOX and have not heard back.

B0010ZR160|3.0|Ben Affleck does a fine job at directing but the story is just way to mumbled and thrown around like a rag doll. I really do not like Casey Affleck as an actor at all, and with great veteran actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris being given parts that should have been more notable, made me like him even less. It starts out great with compassion and motivation in finding a missing little girl, then turns in to the usual drug laden, fowl mouth, crooked cop sludge we have all seen 1000 times over. Lots of people mentioned not being able to understand what Casey was saying throughout the film i for one surely agree. He mumbles out some so called New York type accent, so its very hard to understand what he's saying let alone the names he pronouncing throughout the film.     The story does get quite interesting toward the end and its a question of pure judgment on the part of human respect and dignity. Should children be taken away from abusive or neglectful parents, well that's not for us to decide, that's why they have child services, and laws. So in this movie there is (it seems) more vigilante decisions made for the benefit of the adults, rather than the benefit of the child. The movie really never hits the nail on the head that it intends to, instead it leaves a sort of bitter taste in your mouth and your left asking, what did this all mean? Well as i said its not easily put into words because you'd just have to see it and judge for yourself.    I myself thought the performances were very good, (not oscar worthy as many say), but very solid. I will also say that Affleck does have the nack for good directing, even though he's still in his amateur stages. I think The Town looks like it will probably be better than this, and be a little lighter on the subject matter. This movie just leaves to many unanswered questions, both for the movie, and the audience watching it. In other words many plot holes. There is way to much, Cheese(a person), did this, and Lyle did that,and back and forth with 100 names flying all around in a sea of sentences. By the time the movie ends your pretty confused and worn out. So all in all it makes for a good watch, but still is shaky in its stature. The moral of the story is seen but never made clear, thats up to you. Me? I would just let the law handle kidnappings and not involve private investigators. I would want to take matters into my own hands, but i know the consequences of that, which are semi-shown here. So i'll leave the rest to your imagination, Gone Baby Gone has a lot of it, but its short term.

That means drugs, isolation, and the occult... among other things. It's for the bold adventurers of rock. If you're one of those then give it a full listen. It's an album like no other of its time. The whole band has found this space that's like no other before or since. Yet, this album has been the inspiration of many. It's sort of an enigma. It's sort of ... a presence.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|Kings Of Leon is a band that seems to receive a lot of flack these days. I believe in part it could be due to bitter long-time fans who loathe their now mainstream success and the resulting over-saturation of the band. Or it could be because they've refused to stick with a single sound from album to album.  Whatever the reason, I think the band is unjustifiably bashed by a lot of people who stubbornly believe that ALL mainstream bands are crap, and refuse to accept that sometimes genuinely good bands find mainstream success.<br /><br />Admittedly, I only discovered Kings Of Leon last year through friends as they were really beginning to blow up, and I found the song \\"Sex On Fire\\" so catchy and different from a lot of the crap that floods mainstream modern rock stations that I decided to dig a little deeper. Every KOL album thus far has shown progression from one to the next, even if it's only been gradual. And while I didn't find Only By The Night to be as strong as their previous efforts, Aha Shake Heartbreak and Because of the Times (which are my first and second favorite KOL albums, respectively), I still appreciated the growth they had shown and the fact that they weren't willing to rely on a certain sound throughout their career.<br /><br />That being said, Come Around Sundown shows KOL evolving again, this time focusing on the more melodic moments from Only By The Night and incorporating some more of their garage rock and southern rock influences that were prevalent on Youth and Young Manhood, as well as trying some new things.  The opening track \\"The End\\" most recalls anything from OBTN, and I believe serves the function of transitioning between the two albums. The lead single \\"Radioactive\\" sounds unlike anything KOL has done thus far, and has a very epic feel to it with its gospel-influenced chorus. \\"Mary\\" very much sounds like a garage rock band covering a 1950s rock and roll classic. \\"Back Down South\\" is essentially an alternative country track. \\"Beach Side\\" has a very post-punk feel to it, aside from Caleb Followill's signature vocal style. Still, other tracks seem like they wouldn't have been totally out of place on some of KOL's previous albums. \\"No Money\\" most reminds me of anything from Aha Shake Heartbreak, while \\"Pony Up\\" could've easily fit in on Because of the Times.<br /><br />While the album may not surpass Aha Shake Heartbreak as my favorite KOL album, it is another very strong entry in their catalogue that is worth repeated listens, granted you're not trying to use any of their previous albums as standards of comparison.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:  The End, Radioactive, Mary, Back Down South, No Money, Mi Amigost-punk feel to it, aside from Caleb Followill's signature vocal style.

Even if the product gets here, I half expect it not to get here until the last possible day. The movie was coming from New York and I believe I got it on either the first or second possible day of the delivery range, and in PERFECT condition!
1932100660|5.0|Tells it the way it is. After reading the Bible and the U.S. Constitution, this book is a must read for all Americans. Before the flood, when man ate only plants, man lived for 900 years. After the flood when God said all right you guys you can eat some meat, the lifespan dropped to 110 years in ten generations. The China Study tells you why. Want disease to disappear in your life? Read this book.
0316098337|5.0|Room is an extraordinary novel. The story is told by five-year-old Jack who has lived his entire life with his Ma in an 11' x 11' room. His Ma was abducted 7 years ago at the age of nineteen. Her captor, referred to by Jack as Old Nick, has built an impregnable room out of a garden shed. Old Nick provides the necessities of life, but little else. To Jack, Room is the world. He believes that Room is the entire world and that the images seen on their fuzzy TV are pretend.    Ma has taught Jack to read and to count, to wash his hands and to exercise, but nothing of the outside world.  As Jack's comprehension grows and his curiosity builds, Ma realizes that Room cannot contain them much longer.    Room is a stunning tribute to the resilience of the human spirit, and to a mother's love. It is also uncomfortable to read. You get the feeling of being confined for a long time with no hope of escape. Old Nick controls everything, even the power that is necessary for Jack and Ma to eat and breathe.    A number of years ago I read Slammerkin, and earlier novel by Emma Donoghue and swore I would never read another of her books. But Room has gotten so much press I felt I had to try. I highly recommend it, but not for the squeamish.[[ASIN:0316098337 Room: A Novel]]

0061714372|4.0|OK, I know, Dave Mustaine had some hard knocks, and I completely respect his work and the beast he has created. I love reading about his exploits (a la Scar Tissue from Anthony Kiedis) and his ever changing band. And I find it very cool that someone like Dave Mustaine, who presumably does not need the money, still takes time to write a book such as this. As a guitar player, I just wish he wrote a little more about actual guitar playing.    Regardless, for all your thrash metal fans out there, this is a very cool trip (and I do mean trip) down memory lane. Dave describes the circumstances and the creation of each Megadeth record, and to be honest, also of Kill 'Em All, of which the best song by far, The Four Horsemen, was essentially written by Dave Mustaine. If you're reading this you probably know this. Lord knows his firing from Metallica has been covered in enough magazines and films, but I still couldn't help but wondering what might have been. This was as if Lennon got separated from McCartney due to the instigation of Ringo (and yes, Mustaine is Lennon in this example for anyone needing further explanation).    But I digress... The book is certainly interesting. It kept me engrossed for a 10 hour plane ride and another day spent idle as I waited to climb Kilimanjaro. You will be surprised at his honesty. I knew part of the story, but it is still unbelievable that an album such as Peace Sells could have been made under such circumstances as the band was enduring at the time and yet still stand up as a classic decades later. And though they might have lost the plot in the late 90's (which Dave admits), they/he came back in force with Endgame (and a new Chris, almost as good as the old Chris). Dave Mustaine is the Keith Richards of heavy metal (and I hope I don't offend either of the two by that analogy).    So, a great read. But I'm still wondering, what happened in the unglamorous years of his teens to make him such a good guitar player? Who did he listen to? How much did he practice? How did he practice and what equipment did he use? Etc. This might not be as titillating as tales of drug excess, but for us guitar players, this would be golden.    Still, I can't fault this book. A worthy read for any fan. You can hear Dave's unique voice throughout, sometimes snarling, sometimes triumphant, but always honest.

B001UV4XWY|4.0|Arthur and Norma Lewis have a difficult but overall happy life, until the strange, disfigured Mr. Steward comes into it. He offers them a box with a button, and a briefcase with 1,000,000 dollars. All they have to do is push the button and the money is theirs, but someone, somewhere will die. Yes, they push the button, but that's when the real story begins. A fascinating, surreal, ethereal look at human morality, and an inventive twist on an old tale.
B002VUFKG6|1.0|I found this book to be a boring research paper, almost like a high school assignment. I couldn't get myself to finish it even though I never leave books unfinished.
B001RCD2DW|4.0|These headphones have a love/hate relationship with a lot of folks. Not terribly unexpected after owning and listening to them for almost 6 months.    What I must say... generally, i like them a lot.     Pros:    1. Extremely wide soundstage. Some may say it sounds fake or overemphasized, but personally, I love it. It feels like I am sitting in the middle of the musicians and I can turn my head and hear every instrument separately. Very 3-dimensional.    2. Very detailed and controlled sound. Tight, accurate bass (no flab). Sparkling treble, sometimes a bit bright for my tastes. But I EQ down the treble to my liking.     3. Relatively good comfort. The bumps on the underside of the headband are sometimes annoying, but generally, the headphones are light and there in no vice-like grip smashing your skull. They fit even the largest of heads (mine). I sometimes I forget I am wearing them.    Cons:    1. Not a huge amount of bass response. It is there, but it isn't overwhelming. What is there is deep and accurate/controlled. It is nice. But it isn't thumping your eardrums to mush like a subwoofer would. I am sort of a basshead, hence the reason I own Beyer DT770s as well. I usually EQ my K702s to add a bit more bass to them, and I am content with that. But you definitely need to throw some wattage at these cans to get the bass response you want. Think heavy-duty stereo receiver or separate headphone amp.    2. Power hungry! These cans need juice. I run them from a Denon receiver and that seems to do okay, and also from a Maverick Audio DAC/Amp and that does better. But, I think, the more juice you throw at these cans, the better they will respond.    I paid about $250 for them new from Amazon. Not a bad deal for such a good set of phones.     Overall, a neutral sounding can, with sparkling treble (which my be too bright for some--- and fatiguing) and tight, accurate bass.

B003W5C0VM|5.0|Having seen this tour in 1972 I still have vivid memories of this experience.Sadly not all are good. Many of those around me in attendance were in a drug induced state before the Rolling Stones hit the stage. I feared leaving my seat to get something to drink and taking the chance of having some idiot dropping something in it. That said, the show itself  was an incredible experience.As  this DVD brings to life the Stones were firing on all cylinders and in overdrive. From start to finish one awesome song after another. Mick Taylor was by far the best guitarist the Stones ever employed.His playing is clearly outstanding. Although at the time I believe he was only 19 or 20 years old and looks to be scared to death. The climatic ending will have you in a state of awe as the Stones tear the place down.Without doubt this is the best Stones concert DVD period!Warn your neighbors and turn this piece of rock and roll history up LOUD!
044654759X|5.0|I've been a long time Sparks fan but their have been hits and misses along the way.  This book is a hit!  Nicholas does a great job drawing you into the characters in this book making them both real and like someone you would know.  This book starts with more questions than answers a different approach an element of mystery then shifts into a thriller that will have you turning pages and begging your eyes to read faster.  A fantastic book and a must for any Sparks fan.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|I was expecting a thriller - but Anton Corbijn serves up a post modern Euro style 70s like film - which reminded me of Soderbergh's Solaris - a decidedly non commercial vehicle.  Despite his box office veneer, George Clooney has eclectic tastes as an actor and filmmaker, and The American is no exception.<br /><br />If you're expecting a Steve McQueen kind of show - forget it.  If you're expecting The Bourne Identity - which I was - this is not the case.  If you're expecting Nicholas Roeg meets Ernest Hemingway with a rifle - I think you'll have The American.  This is not a plot driven film, but a character study of an arms maker.  Strangely, it felt like George Clooney's character from \\"Up in the Air\\" had moved sideways to inhabit this movie.  Meaning that Clooney is basically getting into that existentialist mode again.  His character is confronted with the meaning of life.<br /><br />The minimalist soundtrack keeps you in the moment of this Italian setting.  Lots of rolling hills, clouds, and many angles of George Clooney's car scurrying up and down the winding road.  I could imagine the filmmaker there with his tripod.<br /><br />Although not excruciatingly slow, I would hesitate to call this a thriller, but it embraces from what I've seen the feel of the book.  The plot is not airtight, but wikipedia fortunately is available to help the viewer tie up loose ends!  Violante Placido is a sight for sore eyes and the Italian girlfriend you never had.  For the ladies, Clooney shows that he's still a taut looking sex symbol.  Actually, my friends and I thought he might have been slightly too good looking for the part.  I could think of various other character actors that would have sucked me in.  James Woods anyone?  Robert Redford?<br /><br />I would've amped up the plot a little more, but that was never the intention.  So be warned!  Those seeking George Clooney in thriller mode will be better off watching Michael Clayton (again).  I will always remember Anton Corbijn for shooting U2's album covers (Joshua Tree) (PS - I mixed him up with Phil Joanou - the man who directed U2 in their concert doc \\"Rattle & Hum\\" - thanks to Spammypig for correcting me) - and it's good to see he's still around.(Joshua Tree) (PS - I mixed him up with Phil Joanou - the man who directed U2 in their concert doc \\"Rattle & Hum\\" - thanks to Spammypig for correcting me) - and it's good to see he's still around.
0399536108|5.0|This book was a review of my own search for myself. It is for the most part just good ole common sense, but reminds the reader that starting out on the journey toward a more meaningful life is the the biggest step toward self fulfilment.

B00006AUIG|4.0|I agree with another reviewer about the difference between horror movie lovers. Either: a) You love gore and shock cinema or; b) You like atmosphere. Similar to many slow-burning movies, especially 70s films like Changeling, Session 9 is all about foreplay. The characters become familiar, the building becomes familiar, and you find yourself completely engrossed in the film. Although the script could have used some slight tweaking (such as some odd dialog by one of the main actors as he practically relays an historian's account of a former patient's life history), the characters are still well developed. All-in-all this is a good \\"atmospheric\\" horror film that will leave you with a creepy sense of dread long after the credits have finished rolling.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|The storyline is different then, though similar, to any previous versions I have read or seen .  It did take awhile to figure out what came in the package.  Three disc set.  A Blu-Ray with Director's Cut and Theatrical Release, a standard DVD and the digital copy DVD. I had to sort it out to see which one to play on the blu-ray.  The most obvious DVD with the black coating and iron cross was the regular DVD.  The Blu-ray disc was not that obvious and had to read the small letters on the disc.   Blu-ray previews were taken from the internet so I prepared dinner while all that was going on until it came to the \\"Play\\" option.  The rest is interesting.  Movie appears to be the first half of a continuing story.  Some scenes reminded me of Gladiator; Crowe charging on a horse swinging a word and filleting the enemy, arrows flying everywhere, and Crowe walking through wheat fields with his hands open along the tops of the wheat.  Some were very short scenes but the parallels were there.  Good action flic with main characters and storyline intact for a continuation.  I'm glad I purchased the movie.
B0047O2HJC|4.0|This sounds really good, and i prefer the mono versions. But a comparison between this new mono 'Like a Rolling Stone'(i also have an original mono 45) and the SACD stereo rendering from about 8 years ago, and i don't think it's fair to say this new version is the best. I'm sure it's better than the stereo CD reissues that came out after the SACD's, and i would bet way better than the older 'Super Saver Series' CD's from earlier on, but if you haven't heard this stuff on SACD, you really missed something. But i still like these mono mixes very much.
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|I cannot believe that only 17 reviews out of how many (?) were 1 star. This is one of the worst movies ever! How can anyone sit through it without hating it? How many things are wrong? Well, let's count some of them:  1. Overlapping dialog to the point of incomprehension. Robert Altman rip.   2. Plot incoherence  3. The biggest sin: It's not funny! Either play it serious or for laughs. It's obvioulsy not serious, so.......???  4. The screenplay is excruciating.  5. Robert Downey and Gwyneth: where are your standards? You look idiotic trying to sell this. Couldn't you take a look at this and just walk away?  6. Ridiculous CGI, especially the Scarlett Johanson fight scenes. Gag me. So freakin' fake.  7. Excruciating hammy over the top acting by everyone. Everyone gets an F.  8. Director, editor, screenwriter: all should be ridiculed to death for trying to sell this.    So, in conclusion, I'll put this one with North, Ishtar, Love,Actually, and Lost in America.

B003ZJJFKE|3.0|Make no mistake Satch's my favorite and I have had the good fortune of meeting him and watching him live. And every new CD from him brings back hopes of a scintillating and high energy instrumental guitar album. And with every CD the passion and the energy level seem to be going down.  Black Swans is a nice CD and 'The Golden Room' and 'Premonition' are the standout tracks. Yet for those who grew up on 'Surfing With The Alien','Flying In A Blue Dream','The Extremist' and 'The Crystal Planet' - this latest offering doesn't deliver the goods.  A Satch CD must make me jump straight up, fall from the chair and send adrenaline shooting straight through my brains !!!  I was convinced by the title of this CD that this will be the one finally !  Alas ! I am wrong. Satch seems to have lost interest in serious high energy hard rock.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The Sons of Anarchy is a completely amazing T.V. series, and in my opinion the best show ever to come onto T.V. I saw season 2 while it was still being aired on T.V. and that's what actually got me hooked so I went back and bought season one and watched it all, and I'm currently enjoying season 3 which is still being aired on T.V.    The Sons is about a outlaw(ish) Motorcycle club in the small town of Charming California that does just about whatever needs to be done to get by. I gaurantee you that if you give the show a chance and watch just a coulpe of episodes, preferably starting in season one at the beggining, that you will be hooked and you will not want to stop watching. The story line and plot is incredibly well put together and the drama builds and builds every week to the point where it's all you can think about. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give the Sons of Anarchy season 1, 2, and 3 (even though it's not finished being aired yet) about a ten, because it's literally at least two times better then anything else you'll see on T.V.
0385523912|4.0|It is so sad how much death, sickness, and misery ca be caused by a  government controlled by those acting with bad intentions and  obsessed with wrong=headed ideas.    A comparison between (1) Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and Turkey vs. (2)  Kim Il-sun and North Korea is stark.  Both produce dramatic, huge,  and far reaching changes, but ...  One, in Turkey, produced a modern  functioning economy and a democratic government that responds to the  needs of its people.  The other, in North Korea, produced a country  with almost no economy at all and a government that responds to its  people with repression and propaganda, causing them to starve, to  suffer, to remain uneducated, and to miss out on the benefits of  modern technology, economic productivity, and the arts and  entertainment.    The stories in this book are heart-warming and bring a bit of cheer  with their endings, but only because they are about a few  individuals who managed to escape.  Imagine the misery and  desperation of all those left behind.  And, even for those who have  escaped (defected), their stories are no lived-happily-ever-after  ones.  Adjusting to a advanced economy after living in a backward  one is not easy.    It is always possible to claim that a planned economy could produce  acceptable results, even in one run so incompetently and so  selfishly as that in North Korea.  OK, Cuba does not seem to have  produced such great results either.  There is no way to disprove  such a claim, nor any other claim of the form that X would be Y if  only Z.  Still, capitalist systems seem to produce better results  and much higher standards of living, although there are problems with the  distribution of those benefits and the disparity of benefits and  lack of them.  Some capitalist systems do seem to leave behind large  sections of there populations.  And, we do seem to have a fair share  of booms and busts, economic shocks, recessions, etc.    Still, perhaps one of the benefits of reading this book is the  lessons it teaches in the way of thankfulness for the benefits and  living conditions we enjoy in our own society and an appreciation  for just how much worse things could be.  We need to be reminded of  this, especially now, during a severe economic recession.    This book is worth reading, not just because of what you will learn  about a place that we know so little about, but also because of some  of the thoughts it is likely to push you to think about, such as:  (1) There but for the grace of god or chance go I.  (2) How can  single person or a small group of people or a misguided ideology  cause so much suffering, misery, and death, and loss?  (3) How are  other/some advanced societies better and worse, for example: the  U.S. where we've created so much wealth and yet have so many people  without health care coverage, not receiving acceptable educations,  living in poverty, etc. so, is that disparity an inevitable result of  a capitalist economic system.  And, most importantly, what can we do  to help those in our own societies who need help most.

0316098337|5.0|This is one of the most thought-provoking and beautiful books I've ever read.  The first half of the book was almost difficult to read due to the images and visions it provokes, but written from Jack's point of view it was innocent and beautiful.  I have never read a book that made me feel so much - the gamut of emotions from sadness to elation, just a wonderful and revelatory novel.  I did not find te second half to be as compelling as the first, but overall it was a masterpiece.

044654759X|3.0|I trudged through the first half of this book and got very tired of the romance.  Finally, the intriguing part.  Except that I felt like I was reading \\"sleeping with the enemy\\" again.  I finished it, but reluctantly.
0307346617|1.0|Because of the format of the book there is no way for this book to be compelling.  Each chapter is a news-like \\"interview\\" with a different person and their role/reaction to the \\"Zombie War\\". As a result of the author's approach there is no main character to root for, no plot to follow and absolutely no narrative drive to compell you to read further. Not only that but many of the interviews all sound like they are coming from the same person --there is little variation in \\"voice\\" despite the fact we are supposedly hearing the events from a different character with each chapter. Also, there is little concern whether the characters will survive the zombie war; since they are being interviewed ten years AFTER the end of the war they obviously survived.    This really could have been good. But because of the author's choice of approach to the material, it really is doomed.
B003SWZ7TG|3.0|After seeing the movie I wanted to read the book. I liked the story, sadly the Kindle edition is another poor scan with OCR Error and has obviously not been corrected. Many missing spaces or wrong characters 'j' instead of 'f' etc...    5 stars for the story, but only 2 for the scanning.
B00000J048|5.0|I purchased the Quercetti Georello Kaleido Gears, 55 pieces for my grandsons 4th & 5th birthday.  They love these gears! An endless number of patterns can be made with these gears encouraging childrens creativity. There is a handle that makes the brightly colored gears turn. My grandsons play with this toy for up to an hour at a time. This toy seems to be well made. It is made of a firm plastic but not the type that breaks easily. I would recommend Quercetti Georello Kaleido Gears for preschoolers through early elementary age children. A well made, educational fun toy.

B003UYV08E|5.0|I found Iron Man 2 just as exciting as the first Iron Man.  Being a fan of Robert Downing, Jr naturally does not hurt anything.  Who would have thought he was as versatile an actor?  Great flick, some sexual innuendo, very slight swearing, lots of action.  A movie I feel ok for the whole family.
B0040YFR1Y|1.0|'Predators' not only does nothing to advance the series, it actually takes steps backwards.<br /><br />I just finished watching it and it only makes me think of what could've been rather than what it is. In short, I believe the writers and director tried to recapture the magic of the first 'Predator' so much that it actually weighed the movie down like an anchor that wouldn't allow it to go forward. I understand paying homage to the original and making winks and nods throughout the movie for the fans of the franchise, but the excess here just stunk of laziness. The problem was that they didn't know how to do it so they just ended up reinacting whole scenes from the original. It also didn't help that the soundtrack sounded like they just played the original Predator, right over this one. They hit just about every music track from it. Again, they could've been creative and mixed it up with a new score and hints of the original but instead, they just replicated it.<br /><br />Where they really blew it was with the characters. Instead of military, special forces, or even common people, they give us a bunch of disgusting criminals, rapists and murderers from around the world. Why doesn't that work? Because who cares if they all get picked off and slaughtered one by one. We shouldn't want that to happen but I found myself thankful everytime another one bit the dust. If they're gonna ape the original Predator so much, then make these people likable enough that we'd like to see them actually make it to the end. And whoever wrote the script doesn't seem to know how to go five words without the F word either. Again, more laziness. I would've also like to learn more about the Predator's but it was all stuff we've seen before. They also seemed weaker and easier to defeat.<br /><br />Another missed opportunity is that we actually get to see another planet where the Predator's do their ritual hunts, but it would be hard to know it, because just as the characters pointed out, it looks similar to certain areas here. Why not show us something new? Some place so obviously different that you can't help but know your somewhere else?<br /><br />And finally, the plot holes. The very beginning starts off good enough by bringing questions to the surface but they never really get answered. Characters appear and begin to reveal something but it never follows through as to why they're doing what they're doing or where they came from. It just seems like they threw alot of ideas out there but they never strung them together. The end almost comes off like a set up for a sequel but without a cliffhanger to keep us going. If that isn't the plan, then why not wrap it up and explain everything to us?<br /><br />Sufice it to say, I didn't like 'Predators' and won't be watching it again. For my Predator fix, I'll stick with the first 2 and AVP. Actually, AVP looks alot better in comparison to this and I'm looking forward to seeing it next.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Great film for whole family.  Robert Downing, Jr is Iron Man.  So glad he was chosen for this part.  Very little sexual innuendo, \\"bad\\" language practically non-existent, lots of action.  Loved it.
B0043RGY9W|5.0|I never listen so hard to any cd while wearing headphones in my life and all I can say here is that I love what I hear and also notice that the orb seem well aware enough to not (like James Cameron did with Avatar 3d film) over do the 3D effect. What my ears notice is that the sound is a very wide spectrum and expansive and is quite lovely and really suck's you into the sound that made me just close my eyes (and really listen,deeply) and bliss out to the melodies attacking my head. Other bonuses is that there are plenty of Paterson's Efx's bouncing above and below and side to side to keep even the most hardcore Orb fan's very happy, also youth's basslines are very satisfying to the point that I'm now hoping for some Orb remixes to some of the melodies hidden in both compositions.    I love disc 1 but disc 2 (which is a diffrent mix than disc 1) is my favorite because it's more Orb Fluffy Ambient house(y) and I'm told disc 1 is more Pink Floyd (Dark Side Of The Moon) vibe which really get's my attention since I own no Pink Floyd cd's at all but that will change since I'm now intrested in Pink's past work's after hearing Metallic.    All I can say rather you dig this or not this is a very unique way to unite Pink & Orb fan's together, next the VINLY!!!
B000OCZD5G|5.0|I actually own the Blu-Ray of this movie and I have to say for an older movie they did a fantastic remaster of the transfer. Most older movies don't get the clarity this movie has on blu-ray. It's like seeing the movie for the first time again and thats from a person that is VERY picky about what blu-ray's to own. This one you will NOT regret owning on blu-ray. Go for it!     I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that they do as good of a job on the \\"Alien\\" trilogy thats coming on blu-ray.
0060872675|1.0|I'm dashing this off as a public service to children and their parents. The cover is misleading. I picked this up in a used bookstore because my grandchildren love farm animal books. But many of the very realistic illustrations within(of sick, diseased, mishapen, dangerous, deformed, filthy, perverted, menacing, hideous modern street people) are the stuff of night terrors and definitely not what a loving parent puts in the hands of children. Ok, teens and adults, if this stuff is your idea of btilliant \\"humor,\\" enjoy. But, parents, beware.
0312600844|4.0|I waited until I finished Freedom to say, without qualification, that the work has considerable merit. It was a fun read, to be sure, but I wanted to convince myself that Franzen's \\"freedom\\" means far more than freedom to be unfaithful in a stale or soon-to-be stale marriage. Convincingly, Franzen gives freedom its full reign through the life cycle of many of his characters, but I found a different \\"f\\" word to be the most pleasant surprise of the book (more on that later). Freedom has a rich complement of family members and their \\"relations,\\" all of whom are well developed, but none really admirable. They are partly real, partly hyperbolic, and I enjoyed watching their trajectory as a pseudo-voyeur. Franzen completes all his subplot arcs, which parallel the main narrative. Yet, apart from a few telegraphed hints, the story lines are not predictable. We can assume that Joey will finally have his moment with Jenna, as Patty and Richard did, and Lalitha's tragedy certainly has its requisite foreshadow. The rest unfolds in a seamless surprise. I tired of the constant rants, however true they are to the characters' personalities.  Nor did I care for the use of farce because it over-highlights the ridiculous, which was already quite clear. In contrast, I loved the conceit of Patty's autobiography, both from it's first and third-person perspective. It is through her latter \\"autobiographical\\" words to Walter (Richard's idea!) that we learn of the intense desire to forgive and be forgiven. This, for me, is the ultimate \\"f\\" word. Then, just as this major story comes to its conclusion, in a quasi-epilogue, Franzen  gives Walter the last laugh, in the form of an ideological fitting revenge upon his Canterbridge neighbors, including Bobby. Well done, but not a masterpiece!

B003R0LBVW|3.0|I actually enjoyed the story of the Berglunds and an intimate look at the impact and influence that family dynamics play in one's choices and beliefs. it was a touching story of family.  But the tedium of reading the author's over the top political slant in almost every sentence made it difficult for me to enjoy the story.  At times the extreme hatefulness toward all things even remotely conservative made me want to abandon ship, as there was no sense of intellectual honesty in the MANY far left rants.  It offended my sensibilities.  While the depth of Walter's passion and politics was critcal to the character's development, the ongoing political commercial for left thought was not. Oprah sold this book on her show as the novel of our time...as an astute depiction of our world. In some ways it was an asute depiction of our world and the huge divide in our country.  But for the fifty percent of the country who is not far left political leaning and who sees themselves continually portrayed as ignorant, intellectually inferior,  money grubbing and morally bankrupt - this book is not remotely the novel of ou time. Please...be serious.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood plays the role of a generation of many Americans.  In their thirties, they might have wanted to hear, \\"Make My Day\\" but hopefully in their later years they will hear the message in this movie which is not about vengeance but instead truly asks us as Americans who we consider to be our neighbors (and even who we consider family).  Excellent movie.  Disregard the naysayers and check this one out.
B002SF9YUM|3.0|Luis Bunuel ends up getting short shrift here, and the focus is really on the relationship between Lorca and Dali.  I thought Pattinson's accent slipped a bit now and then but he was all right for the most part.  The other actors were stronger, however.    Dali denied any attraction to Lorca IRL although they were friends and Lorca preferred men.  In the film it's played as if they were having a more intense affair than they actually were.  The film also covers some of Spain's political problems in the 1920s and onward, some of which account for what happened to Lorca later.    There is some lovely instrumental music in the soundtrack as well.
B0041I0N9A|4.0|This is my first Lego set I've built in a long long time.      It's not overly difficult to build, the complete shuttle looks really nice and I think will make a great display piece.      I have 2 gripes.  First, I was missing a number of pieces, which I'm starting to understand is pretty standard.    Second, the shuttle is pretty fragile.  Certain pieces fall off easily, meaning that it's not very easy to actually \\"play\\" with.    Other than those two issues, I've been really happy with it and hope to buy other lego sets.

1438509480|1.0|This edition was slapped together using the modern inventions of optical character recognition and just-in-time one-off printing (the day I ordered it). But nobody bothered to review, let alone edit, the result! Let me share a few of the many \\"gems\\". The following is exactly as it appears in the book.    - From the cover: \\"...Marcus Aurelius was Emperor of Rome from 121 to 180.\\" On the first page: \\"Marcus Aurelius Antonius was born on April 26, A.D. 121.\\" Note: he became emperor in 161.  - On page 62: \\"That rational essence that doth govern it, bath in itself no cause to do evil. It bath no evil in itsell.\\"   - On page 99: \\"The sun seemeth to be shed abroad. And indeed it is diffused but not effused. For that diffusion of it is a [-r~Jo-tc] or an extension. For therefore are the beams of it called [~i-~m,~] from the word [~KTEIVEO-Oa,,] to be stretched out and extended.\\"    Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for an edition that benefited from a flesh and blood editor who actually cared about quality.
0060833459|5.0|In 1983, I was privileged to attend a one week project management course put on IBM.  It was an excellent course.  But perhaps the best thing about the course was that IBM gave each student a new copy of two books that were essential to appreciating the material taught in the course.  The two books were \\"The Effective Executive\\" by Peter Drucker and \\"Managing a Programming Project\\" by Phillip Metzger.  These two books still probably stand today as the two really essential guides to effectiveness in a modern career in information technology.<br /><br />Drucker teaches a five-fold program for executive effectiveness.  The elements are:<br /><br />Time Management<br />Focus on Results<br />Build on Strengths<br />Prioritization<br />Decision Making<br /><br />All of these elements are important.  Taken together, they comprise a wonderful guide to executive effectiveness.  One of the most outstanding aspects of this book is Drucker's usage of historical analogies to illustrate his teachings.  For instance, in discussing the importance of building on strengths, Drucker relates the story of Lincoln's promotion of General Grant at an early stage of the Civil War.  While considering this decision, Lincoln was advised by one of his closest aides to keep in mind that Grant was a drinking man.  Lincoln's homespun response was to find out what brand of whiskey Grant drank and to make certain that a case of it was delivered to every Union General.  The point of the story is that Lincoln understood that Grant had a weakness, for the booze.  But his weakness was irrelevant in light of Grant's great strengths as a strategist.  Drucker employs this example to teach his student that the purpose of the organization is to make personal strengths effective and to make weaknesses irrelevant.  And this is truly a timeless message in executive effectiveness.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this excellent little book to anyone who desires a great career in information technology today.  In fact, the teachings are so generic relative to executive effectiveness, that they would apply to almost any large scale organizational career.e to executive effectiveness, that they would apply to almost any large scale organizational career.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I don't know Sandra Bullock personally, but I can admit that I am proud of her as a woman, a mother, and an actress. She has become what many of us women (well, people for that matter) aspire to be. Dream to be. True to ourselves and courageous. A wonderful example. As well, all of the actors in this movie are stars in their own right - just excellent. Not to mention, the real family the story is based on - what better example of love could there be?

0307266303|5.0|The easiest way to describe this book is that it is \\"uplifting.\\"  It is simply an upbeat, positive book about an activity that seems (to most people of European decent) as a fairly mundane activity.  But the book goes further than that: it celebrates human endeavor and endurance, it describes running not only as one of our most basic abilities, but as the progenitor of much of human development; it's a book that feels good to read!    By the way -- the bit on the Kalahari Bushmen really blew me away.  McDougall tantalizes with this sub-plot throughout the book, and as far as I'm concerned this oen story is worth the price of the whole book.    If you like sports history, or if you like science, or if you like human anatomy and physiology -- it's in here.  And, if you finish the book and decide maybe it's time to go outside and see where the world takes you, congratulations -- you have realized, as many others have, that YOU were born to run.
0345505387|2.0|I really did not like this rendition of one of my all time favorite novels \\"THE OUTLANDER.\\"  It might be I am over 60 and I don't understand or appreciate Manga cartoon drawings.  This negates what made THE OUTLANDER so wonderful...Diana Gabaldon's amazing ability to pen beautifully descriptive prose.  Reading THE OUTLANDER SERIES was like seeing a movie in your head. My advice: read the books, skip the cartoons.  It's not worthy.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Perhaps one of the most astonishing aspects of the Harry Potter series (other than the fact that they will make their way through all seven novels) is that, if the critics are to be trusted, the films have managed to maintain a certain level of quality even as several directors have passed the baton to the next man in line.  If you think about other film series that made it out to seven entries or more, like Star Trek or Bond, then you'll notice that they are marred by wild inconsistencies in quality.  As the first film not directed by Chris Columbus, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban represented something of a test for the franchise.  Despite his shortcomings as a director, Chris Columbus's background in adventuresome family films at least presented him as an obvious choice as the director of the Harry Potter films.  With The Prisoner of Azkaban there is a real question as to whether the franchise could continue with a new director at the helm.      And what a director!  When Alfonso Cuaron, the first director to take over from Columbus, was tapped to make the next Harry Potter film he had just come off of his critically acclaimed Mexican film, Y Tu Mama Tambien, a story about teenage sexual exploration.  I wonder how Harry Potter fans reacted to this news.  My guess is that half of them thought Cuaron would make a film where Harry and Ron go on a road trip together only to discover sexual awakening while under the tutelage of an older witch.  It turns out Cuaron did not implant an indie sensibility into the Potter franchise, but I am happy to say he did manage to inject new life into the series.      The Prisoner of Azkaban begins with Harry, once again, living with his aunt and uncle over the summer months.  His Uncle Vernon has invited over his sister Marge for dinner while forcing Harry to play butler for the family.  Marge is apparently not a fan of the Potters because not only does she insult Harry, but she also insults his mother and father.  Ignoring the prohibition against using magic among the muggles, Harry lets his anger get the best of him and proceeds to inflate Marge like a large party balloon.  He then quickly storms out of the Vernon household, suitcase in tow.      This opening scene is the first clue that the audience is in for some changes.  The Prisoner of Azkaban is a darker film, both in its color palate and in its themes.  After Marge is blown up into a balloon, we see her floating across the night sky like some low flying aircraft.  Later we discover that she has been returned to her original state, but Cuaron momentarily allows audience to think she might live out the rest of her days bouncing from one skyline to another.  The initial lingering question of Marge's fate recalls other dark children's films.  In the original Willy Wonka, for example, the condition of each of the bad kids was left frighteningly ambiguous.  This newfound darkness is reflected in the aesthetics of the film as well.  Not only are there deeper shadows throughout the movie, but even Hogwarts's uniforms are darker in shade.     This time around the villain is also suitably menacing.  Each installment in the series has taken an opportunity to utilize some of Britain's most prestigious actors, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is no exception.  Not only do we get Emma Thompson as a teacher of divinations, Prof. Trelawney, but we also get Gary Oldman who plays Sirius Black, an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban.  (The name Sirius Black seems only one step removed from Oldman's first major role as the punk legend Sid Vicious).  Oldman has been fashioning his American accent for so long that I had actually forgotten that he was born a Brit.  Black's face is plastered on numerous wanted posters and newspaper pages.  But because this is a realm of magic, Black's image moves, like some sort of magical .gif, showing him screaming at his jailers (I like to think he's saying \\"Eve-ry-one!\\").  In addition to an escaped convict, the Hogwarts gang must also worry about the likelihood of a roaming werewolf, making this the most Halloween themed Potter film yet.     While the film still stretches past the two-hour mark, The Prisoner of Azkaban feels much more streamlined than its predecessors.  Strangely enough, it took an indie director to make the Potter films feel like a big budget action adventure.  That's not to say that the modest charms of Hogwarts and the camaraderie between the schoolchildren are missing.  In one of the better scenes in the film we see Harry, Ron and other boys bond over magic candy that has the strange effect of causing one to growl like different kinds of animals.  The scene barely lasts half a minute, but it is a wonderful reminder of what its like for boys to form friendships in their early teen years, attempting to impress and one up their mates.  Alongside these smaller character moments (including Harry's tutelage from a new Hogwart's professor) Cuaron creates the longest and best executed action climax yet filmed for a Harry Potter movie.  In the tradition of other great extended action sequences, like Return of the Jedi and The Seven Samurai, nearly the last hour of the film is a tense series of events that, while action packed, are also incredibly smart.  I am loath to spoil the end of the film, but let me merely state that the climax of the film is as carefully constructed as the intricate gears of a pocket watch.       The previous Harry Potter films attempted to capture the wonder and magic of growing up and discovering what kind of world lies outside the bounds of your house, family and hometown.  In this manner, the films are about more than just wizards and warriors.  They also tried to capture the world through the eyes of a child.  The Prisoner of Azkaban, however, is the first Harry Potter film that seems to be looking back at adolescence from the vantage point of adulthood.  The darker tone of the film not only suggests the hard trials Harry must face as a wizard, but also the difficult times he must face as a teenager.
B00404YUG2|5.0|The book was so good, I bought the CD. They're great investments.   If you have any projects, ideas, whims, dreams, etc., that you've toyed with, but never really committed to, this will fire you up and get you into action.

There is also a bonus demo of 'Something to Sing About' which Joss and his wife Kai Cole sing, it is really good as well.  The booklet has the lyrics and notes by Joss Whedon about how the Buffy musical was made.
B000HEVALC|3.0|To be sure, this was a historic occasion, but there's a lot missing musically.  There are a lot of very short tracks containing just a small part of a song; other tracks contain banter but little in the way of singing.  As a historical document there is some value to this CD; it demonstrates, for example, the singers' indebtedness to bluegrass music.  And Elvis's (partial) renditions of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" are interesting insofar as they are much slower than the commercial release that we are all familiar with.  But you won't find full versions of songs on this disk.
159562015X|5.0|Both my husband and I have taken the online quiz.  It has both opened our eyes to our strenghts, and reaffirmed who we are.  I would recommend this book (with the online quiz) to anyone who is interested in discovering more about themselves.
030014332X|2.0|I read the other reviews and decided to try this book.  From the reviews, I thought this would not be written from any particular worldview.  It is.  This author did provide facts and he did insert his opinions.  I bought this book to read out loud to my children.  I only read the first half of the book to myself and stopped.  I kept trying to find a reason to share this book with my children.  The information provided was better provided in the VP History Cards. Here is one quote of advice that the author offered, \\"One day - but there's no hurry - you may come to read the Bible\\". (pg. 25) One book review from the book says it well, \\"Gombrich opens with the most magical definition of history I have ever read... Tolerance, reason and humanity.... suffuse every page of the Little History\\" by Amanda Vickery, Guardian Review.
B002VPE7AQ|4.0|Thoughts:     Perfect Chemistry was one of my friends attempts at forcing me outside of my genre \\"comfort zone.\\" She wouldn't let me leave the book store with out it, even with my heavy complaints of teen drama crap. I understand that Paranormal YA is going to have teen drama crap too, but let's be honest it's going to be much funner with vamps, wolves, and mysteries. So I left my comfy genre, trudging into the terror of teen mello drama. Well I finished in about a day, so it's safe to say I enjoyed it.     I won't say that Perfect Chemistry was completely awesome, everything I never new teen drama could be. No, it was actually everything I thought teen drama would be. Elekeles manages to make the whole top-of-the-cheer-pyramid-perfect-girl-falls-in-love-with-bad-boy-with-secret-soft-side story into something that I was totally absorbed in. The characters were real, they all had there own issues and depths. It was fun learning about the two, then watching them have to get over the hang-ups they had about one another.     This book was pretty formalistic, but Elekeles knows what she's doing. You want to cry and laugh with the characters as the events happen. Elekeles addresses cheating (as in couples), how long you can truly lie to yourself, gangs (in really believable detail), sex, and other life drama. This book is truly about excepting yourself and taking hold of your dreams. With great writing, fantastic humor, and a certain realness to it that a majority of readers young or old can relate to.     One thing I wasn't expecting was the adult content towards sex. Some of the scenes made me forget I was reading a YA book instead of an adult romance. There's nothing too explicit, or at least nothing as explicit as what's shown on TV, but it was not what I was expecting in a YA book. I grew up when french kisses where pretty hot in YA books, and if there was a sex scene it was skipped over. Now I'm not saying that I didn't like how mature this book was, because I really do love the maturity, some younger readers may want to hold off until they're a little older.     Bottom Line:   If you've been thinking about jazzing things up and trying out the YA Romance genre, this is a great start. If you're a YA Romance reader already, why haven't you read this. This book gets you delved into the characters as not many books can do, so enjoy the emotional high. Forget about this being teen drama, drama is every where. This is just a bit more angst with a happy ending, and hot hot tension that will leave you breathless.     Sexual Content:     Pretty heavy make out scenes, and a pushy boyfriend who wants sex. The final sex scene is still pretty hot, but the mechanics are jumped over so it's not too explicit. If you under 16 wait a bit more for this read, or have you parent read it before you try it.     Rating:   4/5- Great! Really enjoyed it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is definitely one of the best animated films ever made.     Highly recommended!
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Despicable Me is about a super villain called Gru (Steve Carell) who is down on his luck and desperately needs to one-up a new, young villain called Vector (Jason Segal). What's he going to do? Why, \\"steal\\" the moon of course. The only way he can pull off his plan is if he manipulates three orphaned little girls, hopefully whom he does not get too attached to. That would throw his ideals into jeopardy, he might actually want to truly adopt them. Well, he'd never make that mistake, would he? Well, yeah, of course he would...<br /><br />A lot of people have complained about Gru, Vector, and Gru's head scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), they say they're too over the top. But that's the whole point. Steve Carrel's fake Russian accent (\\"The physical appearance of the please makes no difference!\\"), Vector's giddiness (\\"OH YEAH!\\"), and the mad-scientist personality of Nefario (\\"I call it 'The Nefario Principle!'\\") are the whole points of the characters. They play off of clich&eacute;s and tropes. That's what makes it work. Really, I thought these characters were pretty funny, and kudos to the actors for making their voices so ridiculous. People also complained about the Minions because they thought all they did was punch each other. I can see where you're coming from, but I think there was more to it. I mean, you've gotta enjoy how they basically love Gru like he's a dictator, and they adore their line of work so much. You could call the gibberish speak gimmicky, but it's actually a lot like a constructed language, you can hear them repeating the same \\"words\\" and \\"phrases\\" in the right context. As for the punching, I dunno, mutated popcorn kernels punching each other worked for me. C'mon, there was more to it, the punches were just the icing on the cake. Speaking of icing on the cake, I was very fond of the musical score.<br /><br />There are a bunch of funny little pop-culture/shout-out moments that younger viewers won't notice, but the presence of these things is much appreciated. By now, the whole \\"Bank of Evil\\" thing is infamous. Some of the other humor was really memorable (\\"Wow! This is garbage. You actually like this?\\"), other bits were nothing that blew me away. Younger viewers will be more entertained by the movie, that's for sure. However, I didn't find Despicable Me boring or anything.<br />Despicable Me captures an enjoyable atmosphere, not just with its score, but also with its world. There don't seem to be any superheroes, although there sure are supervillains. There's an entire secret society of them; a business to being evil. It's really clever, what with the aforementioned Bank of Evil and bad guys actually getting loans for evil projects.<br /><br />The emotional core of the movie is of course Gru's inevitable softening at the hands of the three girls. Because of that, there are a lot of jokes that you've seen before, and moments that really aren't all that funny. Also, the plot starts getting more and more predictable towards the end.

By now, the whole \\"Bank of Evil\\" thing is infamous. Some of the other humor was really memorable (\\"Wow! This is garbage. You actually like this?\\"), other bits were nothing that blew me away. Younger viewers will be more entertained by the movie, that's for sure. However, I didn't find Despicable Me boring or anything.<br />Despicable Me captures an enjoyable atmosphere, not just with its score, but also with its world. There don't seem to be any superheroes, although there sure are supervillains. There's an entire secret society of them; a business to being evil. It's really clever, what with the aforementioned Bank of Evil and bad guys actually getting loans for evil projects.<br /><br />The emotional core of the movie is of course Gru's inevitable softening at the hands of the three girls. Because of that, there are a lot of jokes that you've seen before, and moments that really aren't all that funny. Also, the plot starts getting more and more predictable towards the end.

0060558121|4.0|I have an unending fascination with mythology of all origins, so American Gods was a delightfully fun treat for me. The mix of present day America and mostly forgotten deities struggling to keep their tether to this world kept the story fresh and as relateable as fantasy can be.<br /><br />The focus on both new and old, past and present made American Gods a highly creative novel on a grand scale. Far from fluffy and not quite trying to be as humorous as other novels by Gaiman such as Good Omens, this book is thought-provoking and apt to leave readers not well versed in gods struggling to remember which is which. The highly intelligent writing is well balanced with some of the grittier scenes.<br /><br />American Gods may be a bit of work to get through for those who only know the \\"big\\" gods, but the story is well worth the effort. My only complaint is that the build up overshadows the climax a bit. The end didn't live up to the journey it took to get there. It's very good, just not as epically marvelous as Gaiman fans have come to expect.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Forget all the \\"Saw\\" ahd \\"Hostel\\" movies. Forget \\"Halloween,\\" \\"Friday the 13th,\\" \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street,\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" For my money, there is no scene in any movie more suspenseful or terrifying than that of Henry Fonda, playing the President of the United States, on the phone to the U.S. Ambassador in Moscow, waiting for the high-pitched squeal that will terminate their conversation forever. The squeal will be the sound of the ambassador's telephone melting.<br /><br />Sidney Lumet's \\"Fail-Safe,\\" based on the Cold War bestseller by Burdick and Wheeler, may be black-and-white and incredibly low-tech, but it has lost none of its power to make audiences jump out of their skins after nearly five decades. This tautly paced film presents an all-too-believable doomsday scenario--how technical and human errors bring about an all-out nuclear war--and it is all the more frightening for its matter-of-fact presentation. Lumet demonstrates, for all time, that what a movie DOESN'T show can create far greater dread and horror than what it does. The presence of well-known actors--Fonda, Walter Matthau, Larry Hagman, even Dom DeLuise and Sorrell \\"Boss Hogg\\" Booke--does not detract from the suspense one iota. If anything, their presence intensifies the terror--if it can happen to them, it can happen to us.<br /><br />It's too bad \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" that greatest of black comedies, was released just before \\"Fail-Safe,\\" thus ensuring the box-office failure of the serious movie on an identical theme. Both movies are amazing, and they would make a great double feature. But be sure to watch \\"Fail-Safe\\" first!
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchmann is an amazing writer.  I have no idea how she immersed herself into the arcane details of all this history (and all the places it came from, in different languages, using different calendars, etc.), and comes up with a coherent, readable, lively tale of history like this one.  I enjoy history when it's well-written, and she takes the cake.  She provides facts, the context of the facts, and explains how these facts influences everything else.  For example, we have all heard about the plague, right?  The fact that it affected different locations differently, what people did in an attempt to contain or escape the plague are very interesting.  With a substantial decline in population (up to 90% in some locations), this created problems for entitlement to property, ability to grow crops, and other basic elements of organized (let alone civilized) living.      I LOVE how Ms. Tuchmann mentions TAXES:  how they were levied, collected, used (or mis-used), and levied again.  Chivalry was, in a word, a complete farce.  Preparation for war involved tournaments to \\"practice\\" skills that, it turns out, bore no resemblance to the conditions encountered.  More importantly, it involved pouring the majority of the taxes into sumptuous clothing, banners, feasts, and other activities of conspicuous consumption to impress all those around.  The outcome of the war was almost irrelevant, as those returning home (whether victorious or decimated) were feted again - again, funded by new rounds of taxes.      She also highlights the very first seeds of actions that sometimes took centuries to come to fruition, including the Reformation, land ownership, and rule by consensus.      The thickness of the book is intimidating, but once I got going, it was a good read.  There are so many people involved, it's hard to keep the dance card straight - but if you follow about a dozen key characters (about the amount in your typical TV drama or soap opera), that's enough.  You get the idea that royalty married other royalty by arrangement and for political gain, that people switched allegiances to suit their own purposes, and whoever could afford the most mercenaries usually won their war.      I'd love to find the Ms. Tuchmann of our time who would write as concise a picture of our own time.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones are both clearing their vaults of material we haven't seen in many years, if ever. This concert film was shown in theaters very briefly in 1974 and again in 2010. On DVD for the first time, it gives us an amazing 1972 set performed in Texas at the apex of the Glimmer Twins' career. The band is on fire and Jagger shakes his skinny a** off. Add the awesome Mick Taylor on guitar, Nicky Hopkins on piano, a tight horn section, a killer set list, and a low price, and you've got a must-see, must-hear, and must-have for any fan. After all, ladies and gentlemen, this is the greatest rock and roll band in the world! These 15 songs, originally released on the albums \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" and \\"Exile On Main Street,\\" are all classics:<br /><br />Brown Sugar<br />Bitch<br />Gimme Shelter<br />Dead Flowers<br />Happy<br />Tumbling Dice<br />Love in Vain<br />Sweet Virginia<br />You Can't Always Get What You Want<br />All Down the Line<br />Midnight Rambler<br />Bye Bye Johnny (a tribute to Chuck Berry)<br />Rip This Joint<br />Jumping Jack Flash<br />Street Fighting Man<br /><br />Rehearsal footage and interviews with Jagger from 1972 and 2010 round out the DVD. I give it four stars only because of the relatively grainy transfer and slightly muddy audio mix, but these are artifacts of a film and of technology that are 38 years old. The Stones' impact on the world and our memories is indelible. Don't settle for the geriatric group we recently saw on Martin Scorsese's \\"Shine a Light\\" (good as it was). Go back to the source, back to when rock was young and dangerous!

0091922348|5.0|This is one cookbook that my friends are allowed to read in my house, but not take to their homes.  I love the different flavor combination of recipes - fresh new ideas for salads!  The layout of the recipes and cookbook photos invite cooks to try these new recipes and tastes - and is straight forward.  I have had rosewater in my pantry and finally used it in the Roast chicken with saffron, hazelnuts and honey - and the taste was well balanced.  No fear of new flavors - good cookbook to recommend to beginner cooks too.  The other recipes worked really well too:  sour cherry amaretti and champagne chocolates.  With such simple, fresh flavors, it is good to use the best ingredients available.  This cookbook is full of flavor and inspiration! (I recommend to readers who struggle with metrics - start getting used to it and buy a kitchen scale!)

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|R.E.M. has made a comeback of sorts with this album.  A few of the songs recall the energy and faster pace of their earlier play during the 80s.  Great opening with the punk-like \\"Living Well is the Best Revenge,\\" Stipe closing out the song with a good yell.  \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" is catchy, stirring, hopeful with its refrain of \\"yeah, you cried and you cried, he's alive, he's alive,\\" and the guitar and base play is forceful and fast.  \\"Hollow Man\\" is fun, too, but listen carefully and you can make out the same riff from \\"Gardening at Night\\" on their first EP recording.  I hope they keep up this same energy to make their next album a great one.

B0027G783W|5.0|Wait for Me is a record of introspective ambience, which forces listeners to absorb each and every track in its entirety, if only to conjure an emotion not already discovered.    The album starts off with the somber yet soulful \\"Pale Horses\\" and \\"Shot in the Back of the Head,\\" which is also the album's first single.    Moby's vocals shine through on \\"Mistake,\\" while a female assists on the melancholically powerful tracks, \\"Wait for Me\\" and \\"Hope is Gone.\\"    \\"Study War\\" is easily the most uplifting track on the album, proving that brevity and simplicity in a song's lyrics can go a long way.     Concluding track \\"Isolate\\" not only is one of the most instrumentally magnetic songs I've heard in awhile, but it's easily recognizable as one of Moby's creations. Not many artists who rely on sound over vocals have the ability to make that distinction.    FOR MORE OF THIS REVIEW CLICK HERE    [...]
0786955570|4.0|This board game is a great experience for any fan of role playing games.  You don't need to buy any Dungeons and Dragons rule books or think hard about creating a character for a tabletop gaming experience.  I like to refer to Castle Ravenloft as \\"D&D Light\\".  I would also refer to it as a great introduction to the world of Dungeons and Dragons.  The campaigns and scenarios that come with the game are very fun and make full use of all the components.  The real fun comes when you choose to use your included tools to create your own version of the game.  There is absolutely nothing stopping you from adding your own created items, stipulations, encounters, cards, or specific rules for a scenario.  There is nothing forcing you to do so either.  The game can be easy or extremely hard depending on your luck with dice roles or monsters/encounters drawn, as well as the number of players.  In fact, you might want to add stipulations requiring additional monster draws if you have a full party, otherwise the game is rather easy.  A randomized tile drawing system ensures that your dungeon is never the same, even if you play through the same scenario.  It also includes a fog-of-war element that is well conceived.  For players of Dungeons and Dragons, or other board games of this nature, Castle Ravenloft is a little different in the fact that there is no single player driving the nemesis/dungeon master/enemy mechanics.  Every player's turn also governs the intelligence of the monsters that came into play on their previous turns.  The monsters themselves come with their behavior rules listed on the cards, giving you the directions of how they move, when they attack, what attack they use, etc.  The game pieces themselves are of good quality.  Only the skeleton warriors are somewhat frail (I recommend keeping them in the plastic moldings when not in use), though many of the tokens have weapons or features that are prone to bending, but not breaking.   Sometimes the rules can be a little vague in reference to specifics.  This FAQ is fan created, but set's a good standard for questions that might arise with no official answer.-- [...] --  This game revolves heavily around dice rolls and random card draws.  It is fun, but can seem a bit boring to people with short attention spans or those without imagination or an interest in fantasy settings.  I don't think younger children would enjoy it all that much, but that would depend on each individual.    Regardless, it is a fun game with very well done mechanics and the ability to be tweaked or changed to any owner's desire.  If you've always wondered what Dungeons and Dragons was all about, or if you would ever like it, this board game is a good starting point.  It's also just a pretty darn good board game, period.
0061729078|4.0|Says Huxley, \\"The urge to escape from selfhood and the environment is in almost everyone almost all the time... That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense with Artificial Paradise seems very unlikely. Most men   and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul.\\"    Huxley goes on to describe how some mediums help to \\"open the doors\\" of the soul, such as art, music, religion, etc. Still, the worst things for the human race are what are available to us, and no matter how many drunk driving accidents occur or how many cases of lung cancer exist, people will keep partaking in each of these vices because it provides temporary release.

B002BEXF5A|3.0|The original [[ASIN:B000003S0W 801 Live]] is an exhilarating, one-of-a-kind live document capturing an unusual line-up at one of the only a handful of shows they ever performed. With Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno on board, the original 10-track album is a must-have for fans of Eno or Roxy Music. That's a 5 star album. This reissue, unfortunately, is not.<br /><br />The original album, as issued in 1976, has been available on CD for many years. In 1999, Phil Manzanera reissued it, adding back two tracks previously omitted from the running order: Eno's \\"Golden Hours\\" and \\"Fat Lady of Limbourg\\". Unfortunately, that 1999 reissued was flawed in two ways: (1) the last track on the disc prematurely faded-out before the song ended, and (2) the 2 bonus tracks were mixed very differently, and much more quietly, than the rest of the show. Since those 2 bonus tracks were reinserted into the middle of the disc (where, admittedly, they belonged), it was impossible to play the CD without tinkering with the volume twice (once to turn it up, and again to turn it down).<br /><br />A few years ago, when this 2 CD \\"Collector's Edition\\" reissue was announced, the people at Phil Manzanera's site (manzanera.com) promised that both of these problems would be rectified with the \\"Collector's Edition\\". Well...<br /><br />Let's start with the good news: The rehearsal disc (CD 2), which is entirely unreleased, is pretty interesting listening. The sound (mono, rough) is only decent, but the renditions are noticeably different, with more improvisation, a few mistakes, etc. Enjoyable and very listenable.<br /><br />Likewise, the booklet and package are beautifully done. Lots of photos and reminiscences from the band members.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the first disc is still screwed-up -- a major flaw in a package designed to celebrate the concert captured on that disc! The premature fade on \\"Third Uncle\\" has been corrected, but the problems with the two bonus tracks in the middle of the disc (\\"Golden Hours\\" and \\"Fat Lady\\") have not. Well, to be more specific, it sounds like the volume of the two tracks has been boosted, but the dynamics are still very different than the rest of the disc. The original 10 tracks have a highly compressed, FM-ready sound. The two bonus tracks have much broader dynamics -- very quiet at parts, loud at others -- which is (in general) a good thing but here results in a very uneven listening experience. It's still not possible to listen to the entire disc 1 without reaching for the volume on your stereo/headset/etc. at least twice during the disc. Very frustrating. This could have easily been corrected, either by:<br /><br />1. Applying the same compression to the 2 bonus tracks that was applied to the original 10 tracks -- e.g., so that a ballad like \\"Golden Hours\\" had the same application of compression that \\"Rongwrong\\", another ballad, has -- or<br /><br />2. Remixing the entire disc to remove the compression on the original 10 tracks.<br /><br />My best guess is that they just dropped in the two bonus tracks without remixing the original 10 tracks -- a suspicion further aroused by some clumsy editing of the audience before, after, and even between the two bonus tracks -- and decided not to compress them for whatever reason.<br /><br />Perhaps, like the flawed 1999 release, no-one bothered to listen to the entirety of disc 1 before their production run. Considering fans complained about this same issue back in 1999 on Manzanera.com, you'd think they would have taken more care this time, which leads me to another theory: Phil Manzanera doesn't like the compression on the original 10 tracks and wanted to preserve the dynamic range of the bonus tracks. But, if that were the case, you'd think they'd respond to fan complaints with an explanation.<br /><br />Which leads me to my next theory: The person in charge of producing this expanded disc is hard-of-hearing. Or just doesn't care. Too bad. :'(<br /><br />801 LIVE is a great live record, but for most fans the original 10 track CD is still the best way to hear it.ord, but for most fans the original 10 track CD is still the best way to hear it.

However, Plath's experience is both personal yet easily relatable. We feel in her body when she's receiving the electric shock treatments; we feel in her head as she tries to make sense of why death is so appealing; we feel in her heart as she tries to understand what love is, and why she hasn't even come close to it. Plath clouds Esther's thoughts with plenty of vivid imagery and similes, and by the book's completion, we wish it wasn't over.        FULL REVIEW:    [...]

0439023513|5.0|I've think a lot about the ending of the series, and I can't think of a better way to end it, even though this is fiction and pretty much sci-fi, I don't think I've ever read such a realistic ending.    I can't believe the amount of negative reviews there are, and I think the main reason for them is that during the first books we forget that Katniss is just a girl, she's a 17 year old girl in the middle of a war, she's been traumatized by everything that's going on around her, she's seen people die in front of her, and she has blood in her hands, how can we expect her to have a happy-ever-after kind of life after everything she's seen?    I'm not gona spoil anything, but I think the way she reacted was the way a normal person would react, it's the way men that have been in war react, why can't she? is it because we think of her like some kind of a superhero? like a new wonder women? I mean she already has the costume, right? Well, I don't think so, at the end of the day she's just a girl.    So I think the ending was perfect, it's a bittersweet ending, in a way you are happy she has the love of her life, but at the same time you realize that war scared her, and even though she's happy (she says so herself), she'll never forget what she went through, and the people she lost, so at the end of the book, there's no smile in your face, it's just another reminder that life is not perfect, there are ups and downs, and both define the way you live. So for the first time in my life, I enjoyed an epilogue, not only I enjoyed it, it was perfect.     A perfect ending for a great series.

I saw him in Atlanta and told my then husband that I was as sitting  as close to perfection as I would ever get...and I wasn't talking  about him!  It was true.  Anyway, this album recalls From the   Cradle.  Both are spectacular collections.  Eric Clapton is a true  talent. An honest, true to himself talent.

B000FVQYYK|1.0|Music inspired by secretive visions is hard to fathom, and most of this album was focused on moods and words that just didn't reach out and grab me. Obviously there was great meaning and significance for the band but my \\"search function\\" didn't light up for most of this one. The \\"SuperMassive Black Hole\\" ode was the exception. Dynamic fuzz bass riffs and smooth vocals drew me in and the mysterious words finished me off. I liked it a lot and can see why it ended up in a vampire movie, as the dark edge of emotion it portrayed was like the flavor of smokey peat in good scotch - subtle yet commanding and worthy of savoring over and over again . The rest of the album I tried to like but found as tedious as watching Manga. They need to channel Jim Morrison and break out some more rythmic challanges and moving vocals for the listener.  Addendum: Trapped in my car with only this CD to listen to across WYoming and Montana had me trying again very hard to like the album. The tedious use of the same frantic rhythm patterns and the indistinct muted vocals (\\"Wall of Sound\\" anyone?) led me to rename these guys as the \\"Mumbling Moody Blues\\". Give me Usher rapping \\"Yeah\\" or Hootie and the Blowfish or Gene Autry or........
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Again I must say \\"WOW\\"! I figured with this \\"stripped down\\" version, it would basically be just the guitar John was playing and the vocals like the Acoustic album. I must tip my hat to Jack Douglas & Yoko for mixing this the way it should have been mixed originally! Granted I still like the original mix but this mix is so much \\"brighter\\" and you feel like John is in the room recording it just for you! The vocals are brought out, the background vocals are dropped and the instruments come right at you with a full fidelity and punch that blew me away! I love they kept in the bit of studio chatter as well.<br />  This has always been a bittersweet album for me to listen to. It always broght me back to that Christmas season and losing John. With the \\"stripped-down\\" (think Let it Be...Naked)version, it is more like a rock and roll record! I also have \\"Imagine\\" wich sounds like it was recorded yesterday! Cheers to all involved! I can't wait to get the rest. If you loved the reissed Beatles CD's on 9/9/09...this is just a continuation of that. Great music, sounding great, priced right!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|As I do not watch television--I wait for shows to come out on DVD--I ordered this DVD set without any prior knowledge of what it might contain; albeit I have seen [[ASIN:0783226039 Spartacus]] with Kirk Douglas many times.  To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.  The episodes are well written and the cast--including Lucy Lawless (AKA Xena)--are excellent and provide superb chemistry.<br /><br />While I truly enjoyed the show and look forward to the next season, I want to reiterate that this is adult entertainment with graphic nudity and violence.  While the cinematography may be \\"cutting edge\\" and intended to approach a graphic novel/comic book presentation, I personally found the shaking camera sequences strained my eyes and the one episode with lots of it gave me a headache.<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to state that I do not care for the packaging at all: the set is package like a book and the DVDs are inserted into cardboard pages that, in my experience, end up damaging the discs.

B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones' Ramones is without a doubt one of the greatest Rock 'N' Roll albums ever recorded. It's a rock 'N' roll masterpiece. I really don't consider myself a Punk, but still the Ramones are my favorite band, so even if you don't like Punk rock, you should try the Ramones.  Anyway, this album changed my life. It sounds so raw and full of energy! This album (all of their albums, actually) shows that you don't need crazy guitar solos and a million-dollar production in order to make good music. The Ramones, who knew only 3 chords, recorded some of the best albums ever.  The sound quality of this album is something I've never heard before (I highly recommend getting the version WITHOUT the remastering, if you can get your hands on it. The original quality is way better than the digitally remastered quality). The messy and heavilly distorted guitar sound is brilliant.  Buy this album! You won't be sorry. It's also the best way to get familiar with the Ramones if you didn't hear them before.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I am not a fan of CSI or medical shows, per se. I don't like dark cinematography, moody music and gruesome body parts. Dexter is so different. It has some of this but does it the way it should be done; i.e., artfully and without insulting the intended audience. When I read about how great John Lithgow was in season 4, I was excited. Then, as the season began, I thought, 'well, he's ok....' But boy does he surprise. He just gets better and better and actually makes a serial killer somehow more humane. There are so many great scenes. I am on a pretty tight budget but I bought all four seasons. Season 4 is probably the best. The scenes with John Lithgow, from every detail, right down to him getting upset at the chatting girls at the library to the horrific, vile vitriol he spews at his family, are so engrossing and enjoyable, I believe he earned several awards for the portrayal.<br />This is simply the best show on television right now.

See them live in concert, as I did this week, by any means necessary (short of theft or murder of course). I was reminded of the times I was lucky enough to see Led Zeppelin and Elton John on their very first U.S. tours. Yes, they are that good! And yes, I am that old.  4. Buy extra copies, just in case, for people you will love in the future.  And no, I'm not related to this band, except in spirit.  Cheers!

B003IY48PS|3.0|I had read a review of the new release of Evil Dead on blu ray and that review included a large section on the second disc and the many bonus features contained therein.  Imagine my disappointment when I cracked open my recently-purchased disc from Amazon only to find a single disc edition with no second disc!!!  I had no idea the 2-disc version was in such short supply and that I would not be getting it.  In fact, I had no idea there was a single-disc version at all!<br /><br />I see that Amazon has changed the description to a single disc with almost no bonus features, so it's probably my fault for not looking more carefully.  Nevertheless...<br /><br />Grrr!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|By the time 2007 saw the release of the dismal \\"[[ASIN:B001451HX4 Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem]],\\" the \\"Predator\\" franchise was all but left for dead. Then, a miracle happened as Robert Rodriguez (\\"[[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Planet Terror]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:0800130448 Desperado]]\\") got his hands on the property. Drawing from a script he had originally penned in the mid-90's, Rodriguez teamed up with director Nimr&oacute;d Antal (\\"[[ASIN:B000RGN2JI Vacancy]]\\") in an effort to restore the series to its roots. \\"Predators,\\" the latest saga concerning the jungle-dwelling hunters, is an action-packed roller-coaster ride that successfully ignores the maligned \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" franchise and plays as more of a direct sequel to the 1987 [[ASIN:B000244EMO original]].<br /><br />Although there's no Arnold Schwarzenegger or even a \\"CHOPPAH!\\" to be found, \\"Predators\\" succeeds in delivering the same high-octane thrills as the original film. Although admittedly not as fueled by testosterone as its predecessor, \\"Predators\\" gets by with a solid cast that includes Adrien Brody as the unlikely hero of the story, as well as Alice Braga, Danny Trejo and Topher Grace. Dumped on an alien planet against their will, this group of unsavory characters finds themselves being hunted by a gaggle of bizarre and deadly creatures, the least of which being the titular character(s). Brody has big shoes to fill - essentially replacing Arnie as Dutch - and wouldn't you know it, the Oscar winning actor pulls it off. Laurence Fishburne also appears, making the best of a brief appearance. Fishburne chews up the screen and steals just about every scene in perhaps his juiciest role since \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]].\\"<br /><br />The film certainly has the Rodriguez touch, but Antal definitely puts on a good show on his own. Not only does the film look good (taking advantage of its Hawaiian location), but it is every bit as fast-paced and fun as it should be, too. The only real flaw at hand would be that the central characters aren't fleshed out enough for us to truly connect with them. While the actors themselves turn in fine performances, it's the fault of the script for not giving us enough to care about when the group starts getting picked off one by one. In the end, though, it doesn't serve to tear down the good times at hand. \\"Predators\\" is a more than worthy trip back to the jungle and aims to please its core audience. Possibly the most faithful sequel in recent memory, it's worth watching to be reminded of a time when sci-fi and action were at their peak and goofy looking creatures from across the universe rocked our collective world.shed out enough for us to truly connect with them.

044654759X|4.0|I usually stick to biographies or historical fiction, however some of the glowing reviews for this author sparked my interest. Safe Haven takes place in a small town named Southport and centers around a mysterious young girl named Katie who rents an out of the way cottage. It is obvious to all she encounters that she is hiding from someone or something. Her nearest neighbor, a chatty lady named Jo, slowly gets her to open up about her past.    Katie also meets a handsome man named Alex who runs a local store. He is the father of two young children, who instantly take a liking to Katie. Katie feels herself drawn to this kind and gentle man, but fears her past will catch up with her. When Katie learns about Alex's own tragic past, her feelings for him and his children begin to grow stronger and stronger.    Many reviewers claim this is not the author's best work. I will admit that Katie's big secret was a fairly predictable. It reminded me of a certain movie. I won't say which one without giving away the whole plot. However, the supernatural ending really made this novel unique to anything I have ever read. I really enjoyed the author's way of developing his characters and setting. His writing is the type of work that makes you feel at home. This is the perfect novel to curl up with after a hectic day. I look forward to reading his other books.

One could say there are the lucky children and the unfortunate,however being born into a poor environment with a very different culture does not mean the child is not loved and cared for, it is just that life is very hard in a lot of areas on our globe ...

Learning about Tinker Bell and the rest of the Fairies makes me feel like a kid again.  I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.  Great for the whole family.  So charming, cute, and funny.

B001HM1PFO|1.0|I'm very into music but NOT musicals.  I was a karaoke DJ for over two years and everyone that came to my bar swore by this movie and performed songs from it.  I watched it for the first time today and WOW!  What a waste of 1hr and 40min.  It took all of my willpower not to turn it off.  I sat through it even though it was against my better judgment.  Now that I know where \\"The time warp\\" comes from, I think I could die without hearing that song ever again.  There is absolutely NO story line, the characters are NOT relatable and stupid, and the songs all SUCK!  What is the big deal about this junk!?  I mean c'mon people!  \\"The sound of music\\" was WAY better and underrated.  I've come to the conclusion that musicals are not my cup of tea.  I know movies and this one should be burned.
044024367X|3.0|This is an moderately entertaining book that lacks the depth and heart needed to fully engage the reader. The plot is reasonably well developed, and the sparse prose style is often engaging and well suited to the story, particularly in the first third of the book. I nevertheless found the novel disheartening in its depiction of a bleak world as told from the point of view of an exceedingly depressed and world weary protagonist.<br /><br />If all you want it is a story that well help to pass the time, then I think this book will meet your needs. The author began to try my patience, however, by developing an endless series of long, drawn-out action sequences described with the dry accuracy that one might use to record the workings of a watch. There is little in the way of character development. The author provides an excellent and highly detailed description of the \\"chess board\\" on which the action takes place. I could easily envision the hundreds of square miles in the rolling hills and barren plains outside Colorado Springs, Colorado where the action takes place. I wasn't really bored reading the detailed descriptions of how the protagonist moved over this playing field, but at the same time I was not really engaged either.<br /><br />This book takes place in a cold unemotional place where there is little hope, and little reason for joy. That's fine as a philosophical position, but it is not really my idea of great escapist fiction. The author seems to have no abiding faith in humanity. I respect his right and his obvious talent for presenting his vision of such a dreary and heartless world, but it is hard for me to get excited about it. I think the pseudonymous Richard Stark did this kind of thing with considerably more aplomb.<br /><br />This is my second Lee Child book, and despite my disappointment in this volume, I am likely to read more in this series. I enjoyed my first Reacher book, \\"Bad Luck and Trouble,\\" quite a bit more than I enjoyed this one.  For now, I'll assume that \\"Nothing to Lose\\" was simply a misfire, and after a time I'll try another in the series and see if I find it more satisfying.ing to Lose\\" was simply a misfire, and after a time I'll try another in the series and see if I find it more satisfying.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself to be in pretty decent shape, but this dvd kicks my butt!      I did Level 1 for about three days before I decided to move too fast and move on to Level 2.  Level 2 was so intense that I had to switch back to Level 1!  I don't even want to know what's on Level 3.    I've been using 8 lb weights for this dvd, and I would say that those are pretty hard for me.  I would recommend 5-6 lb weights for starting the workouts.  I've noticed that with 8 lb weights I can't make it through some of the strength circuits without pausing a couple times.    I combine this dvd with Jillian's Yoga Meltdown for that extra push, and I'm always drenched in sweat by the end of it!      I recommend using this dvd on days off from the gym, or mixing it up with other Jillian and Biggest Loser dvds to avoid becoming bored.  After just 4 days of using it, I've definitely noticed a difference in my strength and endurance at my group gym classes.

0061997811|5.0|This is a terrific addition to the Potter universe as the depth rivals that of the films.  Little things like \\"ads\\" for magical products and the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes catalogue add incredible layers to the interactive tome.  Fans will remove all sorts of items like Slughorn's Apothecary labels of products used in the movies.  There is plenty of information and articles on how the films made the Roweling realm realistic, which include supporting photos, salt as snow and much more.<br /><br />Sent to me by the publisher, you can't help but tear this fabulous entry apart.  My spouse cringed when I ripped open the cellophane and had cardiac arrest when I pulled out Potter's acceptance letter to attend Hogswarts Hall; though he also marveled at the details of the castle and cave, etc. and touched the pullouts (he cannot have my ticket to the Yule Ball).  In fairness, he laughs at people who claim they owned that first Spiderman (see Amazing Fantasy #15) as he once did, but admits his copy was worth chump change because his mom bought it for him at a bazaar and he read it as a tweener a zillion times.  Now if I can only obtain a second ticket to the Yule Ball so he can escort me; perhaps an order of Pumpkin Juice or with the help of Professor Snape.  This is a great holiday gift for that young fan or in my case the ancient collector (wonder if there is Potter could put the cellophane back on).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|Don't know what I was expecting from this CD, but what I got was a very mellow laid back Clapton doing classic pieces (Old Rocking Chair and Autumn Leaves - yep, that Autumn Leaves)and including every genre imaginable from jazz to country. The musicians accompanying Clatpon were obvously best in class because all of the pieces fit together. This is not head-banging drop dead Clapton rock n roll but I enjoyed the tasteful guitar on each track.  Probably not for everyone, but I liked it.
B000056K04|5.0|When you first put in the album, it immediately kicks off with the opening lick of I Did It, played on an electric Baritone guitar. Immediately you know this album is different. This album was intended to be a change of pace for the band. After the fun jams of UTTAD and Crash, the band went into a darker album BTCS, and then with this album they went to a more Rock/Pop theme. Now this is certainly not my favorite DMB album, and it started a chain of 3 albums that were rather disappointing (those being Everyday, Busted Stuff, and Stand Up), before finally going back to the old style with Big Whiskey. Anyway, though this album is different, from the beginning I welcomed the change of pace with open arms. This is not an \\"everyday\\" DMB studio session. The songs were written by Dave and the producer without the assistance of the other band members, which means the album lacked the studio collaboration that usually goes on, meaning Dave or another band member plays a riff and the others join in on their respective instruments. This song also leaves out any long songs and sticks to radio friendly, 4 minute tracks.  Everyday is the longest track on the album at only 4:44.  But still, the album kinda grows on you with time.  The older albums had long 8 minute tracks with good jams, but this album is a simple pop album.  It attracts new fans with a new style of music.  But it still references some older styles of playing.  Everyday evolved directly from the old #36 tune from the Red Rocks cd.  Angel sounds a lot like Jimi Thing.  And the album produced a lot of great live tracks like Everyday, So Right, and What You Are.  Moving on to reviews of each individual song:    I Did It - A simple 3:36 minute radio friendly tune. I still to this day enjoy listening to this song.  Though Boyd and LeRoi don't have a part on their instruments much, Boyd gets to shine with some vocals for a short section of the song.  It is certainly different from any other DMB song that preceded, but it is a great rock song.  7/10    When the World Ends - A song about love, sex, and death (as described by Dave).  This is one of my favorites off the album.  The lyrics are fantastic.  One of those songs you can listen to a bunch of times and it still sounds great.  9/10    Space Between - A very simple guitar riff with lyrics about love.  For some reason this song isn't very popular with diehard fans, but I think this song is beautiful.  Definitely my favorite on the album.  10/10    Dreams of Our Fathers - This song is rather painful to my ears.  I hate to talk harshly about a DMB tune, but this is just not a good song at all.  Obviously expressed by the fact that it is the only studio album song to never be played live.  Dave's singing is just not very enjoyable here.  2/10    So Right - A great rock song about love.  This song sounds fantastic, though the lyrics are kinda cliche  One of the songs on the album that actually has a sax solo.  8/10    If I Had It All - A softer song, but very enjoyable.  A song about wanting more about life.  7/10    What You Are - This is a fantastic song!  It is probably the best live song on the album, and the music is just very powerful.  8/10    Angel - A beautiful love song that just begs to be played at your High School prom.  I'm not sure how other fans feel, but the sound reminds me a lot of Jimi Thing.  Kinda odd comparison, cause that song is about getting high while this song is about a beautiful girl, but the opening riff actually came from a lick Dave played before Jimi Thing at a live show, and the entire song kinda reminds me of it.  This song is just a beautiful piece.  I'm disappointed that it didn't last long as a live song.  10/10    Fool to Think - This song is kinda interesting.  I didn't really care for it when I first heard it, but it grew on me as many other songs on this album have.  This is the other song on the album that has a sax solo.  I'm still not sure what this song is about.  I haven't listened toit as much.  6/10    Sleep to Dream Her - Another love song.  Didn't care for it much at first but now it is actually one of my favorites on the album.  8/10    Mother Father - Carlos Santana contributed on this song that has a latino background song.  This is not a very popular song, as shown by the fact it was only played 8 times in 2001 and never seen again, but I really like this song.  I have the only released version of this song that was released on a Warehouse 8 compilation, an it was very good!  I wish they would resurrect this song in the future.  9/10    Everyday - The old #36 riff finally gets put on an album, but I really wish they would have recorded #36 in itself.  This song is one of the more popular songs, but I don't really care for the studio version at all.  The lyrics aren't very good.  When played live however this song is enjoyable, with a fantastic violin solo that preludes the song and then it goes into #36.  But sadly, that doesn't occur on the studio recording.  5/10      Overall, this album wasn't perfect, but there are a few really good songs on here like Space Between and Angel and Mother Father that make this album worth the purchase.  Give the album a listen all the way through.  It will grow on you.

0061997811|5.0|Back in 2007 when I wrote a review for a Harry Potter poster book, I bemoaned the lack of companion books for the Harry Potter films and wished that somebody would work on a serious \\"the-making-of \\" type of book for the HP movie series.  So when I saw \\"Harry Potter Film Wizardry\\" on my Amazon's recommended future releases list last month, I went, \\"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!\\" and now that I have the book in my hands, I say, \\"Finally!\\" This is the book that the Harry Potter films deserve and the one movie lovers have waited for.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter Film Wizardry\\" covers the first six films and the first part of the Deathly Hallows.  The behind-the scenes information and material contained in the book is probably a fraction of what seven films would generate, but Brian Sibley and the cast and crew managed to pick the most representative items from and the most memorable moments of each movie and filled the pages with photographs, sketches, storyboards, concept art and scenes from the films. This book is not only a delight to look at but also to touch. There is the letter addressed to \\"H. Potter, The Cupboard under the Stairs\\" to pull out from its envelope; Honeydukes candy boxes to punch out and assemble; the Yule Ball and the Quidditch World Cup programmes to admire, Proclamations to decorate your walls; the detailed Marauder's Map is ready for you to unfold, and there are a Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes product catalogue and the much more sinister Borgin and Burkes catalogue to pore over.  These are, of course, clever and fun ways to present some of the props and ephemera created for the movies.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter Film Wizardry\\" will keep any fan of the HP films happily reading (and admiring the pictures) for hours. It belongs on the shelf of anybody who enjoys the magic of the movies.  As for me, this book is a wish come true.

B000M341QO|2.0|I love Jack Nicholson, which is the only reason I picked up this film.     The Departed takes much too long to get started. The first 45 minutes could be clipped down to 20 to improve pacing. The profanity was stunning. I'm not a prude, but after the first 20 minutes I thought about just turning it off.     That's a shame, because the final 20 minutes of the film are fantastic - a bloody conclusion worthy of crime film fans. The camera work is good, and so is the acting. There were some plot holes that could have been filled had they focused on that, rather than winning the Guinness Book's record for using the \\"f\\" bomb.    Jack Nicholson's character had the BEST lines, though. I got a good laugh out of several of them.

0316098337|3.0|I was really looking forward to a classic from Donoghue and I thought I had one about 20 pages into the novel and from there until the end of the first half of the book. The fascinating coming to awareness story in horrific circumstances of the first half has to be one of the most powerful in recent fiction. Yet for me the book fell flat in the second half.  I won't reveal what separates first and second parts though this is probably easy to find in other reviews - in fact had I not read reviews that gave the plotline away I think i would have been absolutely incredulous and amazed at the setting and plot of the story.     But the second half for me did very little. I am left a bit with the feeling that if only Donoghue had been able to maintain the drama and tension of the first half into the second half, or if the first half were actually the first 90 percent of the novel, we would have had a timeless classic. While very well written and powerful at times, the second half seems to just grind on a bit pointlessly. Donoghue has shown phenomenal potential and imagination, so I will look forward to her future books
B003S897UK|5.0|If you like guitar masters who have not only figured out ways to display their talents, but at the same time how to honor the past greats you are in for a great ride. Warren has such an amazing talent for playing so many types of music with just the right touch of feeling and emotion. His voice allows him to cover so many different levels as well. Gov't Mule is not a mainstream band, but for people that truly appreciate real talent, they are giants. If you can get to one summer music festival, don't miss out on the bands Mountain Jam at Hunter NY in early June. Besides seeing them play two nights you also have Warren joining many of the acts for a couple of tunes. Add to that the Drive By Truckers, The Derek Trucks Band along with many other great bands and musicians you will be in for one great weekend. Like Warren's taste in covering great songs, he also has the talent to recruit great bands from the past and present.  This recording is incredibly crisp and beyond most any live recording I've ever listened to. This is an album that demands to be played loud. If that's not your taste, don't buy it. For the price you get three albums for the cost of less than one. Thanks Warren !!!!!

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|A tsunami rushes in on an island resort where Marie (C&eacute;cile De France) and Didier (Thierry Neuvic) are staying.  Both survive, but Marie almost drowns and has a near-death experience, with ghostly light and indistinct figures...George Lonergan (Matt Damon), an apparently psychic American in San Francisco, is pushed into giving a reading for Christos (Richard Kind), a business associate of his brother Billy (Jay Mohr); George resents doing it, claiming that his \\"gift\\" is really a curse...in London, twin brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle to help their drug-addict mother (Lyndsey Marshal) keep it together enough so that they don't get taken away by the social services - but fate has tragedy in store for them.  Three stories, linked by death, gradually coming together, gradually influencing each other.<br /><br />The bulk of HEREAFTER is about coping; George copes with his unwanted abilities, feeling isolated from his brother and even from the attractive and interested young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) that he meets at a cooking class.  When she thrusts herself on him and pushes him into making dinner at his place with her, she finds out a bit of his guarded past, and the results aren't what either of them desire.  Marie finds both her relationship with Didier and her job as a television journalist faltering, as she decides to write her dream book about a late French politician but can't forget her near-death experiences; and Marcus struggles with loss and even comprehension as a child who feels his life cut in two.  Very gradually, all of them are drawn in similar directions, emotionally and eventually physically.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's 31st film as director is, like a large percentage of his work, concerned with death.  Strangely enough though this film marks an inversion or reworking of many of his previous concerns, in that death begins the film, is at the very heart of the lives of most of the main characters - and yet, ultimately, is less oppressive and less a tragedy or even endpoint than it is in most of his previous films.  In almost every way, the film starts out in major keys and works its way towards the minor chords, from loudness to quiet, from tragedy to possibility.  It's a film very much imbued with the literary and musical worlds - strands of opera impinge periodically on Eastwood's fine low-key score, and De France's character is a writer and journalist while Damon's is obsessed with Charles Dickens.  Cinematically, it works out as a very un-dramatic drama, and even the coming together of the three plot strands seems inevitable and preordained as a literary device rather than the movie-thriller that the misleading advertising promises.<br /><br />The film is going to irk a lot of people because of its slow pacing, and its refusal to come to anything definite in regards to the questions posed throughout.  And there are going to be people who are serious skeptics and cynics who won't like the hints of the extraordinary throughout the film - which remain, for the most part, just hints.  But this is not a film trying to come up with any answers to life's ultimate questions - Eastwood and screenwriter Peter Morgan aren't interested in such simple pieties, and they are wise enough to know offering such bones for the audience wouldn't let their characters off the hook.  These are people that have to live with the facts of death and what it means to those who survive - even knowing what comes afterward, if anything, wouldn't necessarily make the daily business of getting on with things any better.  And all of them begin to realize this over the course of the film; if there's a definite message here, it's that while the conversation about death and it's meaning is a worthwhile one, it's this business of living and overcoming our dark obsessions with the afterlife that is important, and that makes our lives in the here and now worth anything.<br /><br />HEREAFTER is put together with Eastwood's habitual economy and grace; as has been said many times about his work, it's a film with nearly invisible direction.  This might not always be a compliment, but in this case it very much is; apart from the big CGI tsunami at the beginning and a couple of other important scenes that I don't want to spoil, the camerawork is never ostentatious, never gets in the way of the characters or feelings, which are just about all the film is concerned with.  The focus then is on the actors, and they do not disappoint.  This is the best piece of large-ensemble acting that I've seen in a while and it may be the best cast Clint has ever put together.  Bryce Dallas Howard is extraordinarily charming and winsome in an ultimately unfulfilled role; C&eacute;cile de France is luminous and conveys a careworn look that seems to age her a decade from her first scene to the rest of the film; the British cast members are all terrific and I'd especially like to cite Lyndsey Marshal for a small but powerfully moving portrayal of a woman on the brink.  Matt Damon, though, is working on a level that echoes his director's work, disappearing into his role so completely that he had me completely feeling for him from the beginning.  He is ultimately the engine that drives the resolution of the plot, and yet as a very passive and introverted character it's a challenge to make it believable that he would be able to push himself as he does in the last scenes in the film; somehow Damon conveys that inner power and specialness with an ordinary - deliberately ordinary - exterior in a way that is riveting.  I've rarely seen an \\"average Joe\\" who is so compelling.<br /><br />And it's the reality imbued in these special-yet-ordinary characters that makes the last few scenes, aiming for a magic and transcendence that I'm not sure I've ever seen Clint Eastwood attempt - and that few directors in Hollywood today are capable of or interested in attemptin - work.  If you weren't pulled in, put on the edge of your seat by this slow, somber but intense film, you'll probably find the ending stupid.  If like me you really feel like all this contemplation of death, and the futility of really understanding it, has made the small fantasies and artifices in the film fade away and left you with some kind of higher truth - however indistinct, like C&eacute;cile's blurry deathly visions - you may well be enraptured, as I was.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the trailer for this film seems to promise something like this summer's hit INCEPTION; and given that more people know Matt Damon for the \\"Bourne\\" films than anything else, a lot of people will be expecting a thriller, something with sci-fi or fantasy overtones, excitement, effects... They're not going to get it.  If there's a model to compare HEREAFTER to, I'd suggest the last few films from the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, who like Clint Eastwood made his name with films dealing in violence and action, but ended his career on a quiet, reflective and humanistic note.  It's a tribute to how great a filmmaker Eastwood has become that he can stand in such company.<br /><br />One of Eastwood's best films, and my favorite film of 2010 so far.grace; as has been said many times about his work, it's a film with nearly invisible direction.

B003K025V4|5.0|I have never really been a Miley Cyrus fan and when this album was released and i saw the cover, i was sure i would think even less of her, but i was wrong. I like all the songs on the album and even though \\"Cant be tamed\\" was the first single off the album, its my least favorite, not sayying i dont like it...just my least. I love \\"Take me along\\" \\"My heart beats for love\\" and \\"Scars\\" very addictive and they really show off her vocals. \\"Who owns my heart\\" took me a while to get used to, but i now include listening to it when i put the cd in the player. All the others, \\"Liberty Walk\\" \\"Permanent December\\" Forgiveness and love\\" not exactly greatest hits, but fun to listen to. Also great version of \\"Every rose has its thorn\\" I would be the kind of performer she is. Edgy, racy, sexual. Goodbye Hannah Montana, she's grown up, thats what happens in life. She's Miley now.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I didn't buy this dvd, but saw the movie on cable.    It's just about a couple of young adults (one with a video camera) running around NYC while some monster is destroying the city.    It ends with their death.      Not much more plot than that.    Don't waste your time or money on buying this DVD.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|The Emperor's New Groove was one of the best Disney hand drawn animated movies of the 2000s.  In a time of when Disney released very few and often junk films like Journey to Atlantis and Home on the Range, Groove was a unique and genuinely funny movie that was and is under-appreciated.    Groove ranks among my personal top 10 favorite Disney films and this is mainly due to the hilarious characters and the actors who voiced them.  David Spade, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton steal show, and keep you constantly laughing throughout what I think can be called the funniest of all Disney films.    I give it a 5 out of 5, and if you have not seen it give it a watch!

B0021L8V1Q|3.0|If I could give Iron Man 2 a 3 1/2 star review, I would.  When I went to see it soon after its release this past summer, I was initially somewhat disappointed.  The first Iron Man got so much right - a good, consistent storyline with amazing effects and a spot-on portrayal of a flawed, egotistical human being finding some sort of redemption through becoming a super hero.  But I would have to agree with many reviewers who felt that Iron Man 2 was incomplete and rushed.  I still enjoyed RDJ's characterization of Tony Stark and I liked the interplay between Stark and Pepper Potts, but I felt that Don Cheadle's character was wasted and frankly, Mikey Rourke's Russian gangster/ physicist felt out of place.  Plus (spoiler) when he first arrives at the race track early in the film, destroying cars, wreaking havoc - how hard would it have been for someone to shoot that guy?  He had no armor!  Anyway - it's a comic movie, so I don't expect too much logic.  Regardless, on later viewings, I find myself enjoying the film more as a popcorn movie, but hopefully the upcoming Marvel films and the Avengers movie will be have more of the feel of the first Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (which I really liked) or X-Men 2 than Iron Man 2.

B00002MZ4V|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see John Williams at the Hollywood Bowl this summer, so I was inspired to buy this CD (actually my ladyfriend lost this CD in a move years ago).  While the 2 CD set is only current through 1999, it's a wonderful overview of the prolific, beautiful output of this composer.  It includes some of his very early work, along with the obvious scores (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List).  Plus it throws in a few less well known Williams compositions, including a track from 1941, Spielberg's interesting attempt to make a WWII comedy.  Overall, great item if you can get a hold of it!
B003ZW0MS0|3.0|On Buddy Guy's 2010 release, \\"Living Proof\\", Buddy does, indeed, prove many things. He shows that when he's not goofing off at a small arena, refusing to finish his own songs at a concert mostly populated by middle-aged whites who are Classic Rock and Stevie Ray Vaughan fans, his hysterical, violent guitar is still up to par. The 74 year old Buddy Guy's incendiary guitar is present throughout the album. In fact, this is the best his guitar playing has been since his legendary \\"Stone Crazy\\" album. With that being said, there is a great sameyness to a couple of the songs on the first half of the disc.    Buddy's vocals are still there. His voice sounds just as good as it did on 1993's \\"Feels Like Rain\\", though I'm not sure how his voice holds up in concert after he's been on stage for an hour.    One thing that's evidently missing on this album is lyrics. \\"Living Proof\\" has some awfully corny lines, just as the duet with B.B. King does. The difference between the two is that B.B.'s guitar, which has an angelic presence that can bring a person to tears with one note, makes the lyrics in \\"Stay Around A Little Longer\\" rise above their otherwise mediocre level. It's extremely obvious that many of the lyrics on this album were touched up or, in some cases, written entirely, by Buddy's drummer or professional lyricists who did not come up with Buddy back in Louisiana. For a veteran Blues-listener, it takes only one listen to hear that an outside source has tampered with the lyric writing process. This doesn't mean that whites can't write Blues lyrics, but it does mean that songwriters take the grit and urgency out of what could possibly be more \\"authentic\\" lyrics. We all know that the great Muddy Waters performed and recorded a plethora of songs that were written by Willie Dixon, but Dixon was a man who had a connection- a vital connection- to the people, places and situations which he wrote about, even if the lyrics were sometimes light and humorous.    Luckily, Carlos Santana, in all his noisy grandiosity, does not destroy \\"Where The Blues Begins\\", as I had feared he would. If there were ever a case of a guy who played too many notes on an electric guitar, to the point of making electrified Blues sound like Ritchie Blackmore-era Deep Purple, this is it. Carlos really ought to focus more on composing music, as opposed to creating obnoxiously loud solos that all sound identical. When the song is over, one remembers Buddy's fine vocals, but not Santana's guitar madness.    \\"Too Soon\\", in terms of its beat and lyrics, sounds like a track that Otis Rush could have recorded in the 1950s for Cobra Records. It's a fun song that just rises above being filler.    \\"Everybody's Got To Go\\" could do without the backing vocalists, or at least the backing vocalists' excessive presence. The solo at around 2:00 is just sort of, well, there. This song would have faired much better if it were just Buddy, his guitar, and the Hammond Organ. That certainly would have sounded a lot different than this \\"Feels Like Rain\\" knock-off.    If Buddy would have never recorded \\"Damn Right, I've Got The Blues\\", then perhaps there would have been a reason to record \\"Let The Door Knob Hit Ya\\". Is there frenetic guitar work? Yes. Does the frenetic guitar work sound any different from what's played during Guy's live version(s) of \\"Damn Right, I've Got The Blues\\"? No!    Guess what! What? \\"Guess What\\", which has a final verse resesmbling Hendrix's \\"Red House\\", is a very, very good song that would have sounded even better if so many tunes on the album didn't sound similar to it. Still, this one has more intensity to it than anything Eric Clapton has done since...    \\"Skanky\\" is a tour de force that is well deserving of its name. As the songs come to a close, you realize that tracks 11 and 12 are, along with the infamous \\"Stone Crazy\\", the finest examples of Buddy Guy's influence on, or at least association with, Hendrix.\\"

B000007R0S|5.0|Hey everybody!    There's already a number of reviews here regarding the DTS CD, but let me chime in: this is one of the finest Surround music experiences I've had so far, and I have Avalon SACD at home, Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms, Dark Side of the Moon, or Alan Parsons' Valid Path. This is a highly recommended disk, the separation is just outstanding, and the sound quality is pristine. Dynamic and crystal clear, and you truly feel surrounded.    In addition, if you have the stereo version, you will know that it has the four new songs (Get Over It, Girl From Yesterday, Learn to be Still, Love Will Keep Us Alive) at the beginning as studio versions. Well, this DTS version omits the studio recordings, but you get more of the actual concert: all four new tracks are included as live versions. So even if you already have the original CD, this is well worth adding to your collection.    All you need to play this back is a CD or DVD player with digital output, and a DTS capable receiver to decode it. You can still find this CD reasonably cheap. Go for it, guys. Highly recommended.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Great story, true to the book.  Cast was very well selected - don't think the role of Elizabeh or Mr. Darcy could be better chosen.  Wonderful quality - this was a replacement for my old DVD, which replaced the VHS.  Obviously, I am a fan of Jane Austen's classic!
1577314808|5.0|I was recommended this book by an acquaintance who I very much admire. I had come to him in a fit of distress that was triggered by the end of a difficult relationship I was in. I bought the book without hesitation. I was 17 years-old and everything in my world had a despondent haze hovering over it. I wasn't going to hesitate to buy something that would 'fix my problems'.    I opened the book hoping to find a path to salvation. What I found was much different, and much more powerful. There's no way I can see to briefly explain the book, but the power in what is said inside is out of this world. The book is not a guide to 'fixing your problems', it's an assistant to a finding a new, and true way of life.     I would recommend this book to just about anyone. Even if you don't take away from it what I did, it's still very insightful and completely worth reading.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Starz knew what it had when the story was pitched to them and whoever was the genius that chose to let the story carry the weight of the first season and be creative on the depiction of Rome with minimal sets should be rewarded with much coin. My hope is the strong story telling remains and the requirement of huge production dollars is kept at bay so that the entire tale might be told.    I am a huge fan of Rome. HBO has always prided themselves on attention to details for all their series and the expense of that detail killed Rome. Had HBO trusted in the power of good story telling Rome would still be airing on Sunday nights.    The gods will not allow the same fate for Spartacus. I hope the gods favor Andy Whitfield as well. His emotional connection to the character had me pressing play well into the wee hours of the morning and I cannot imagine the series continuing without him. Spartacus the character could have easily been written to dominate this story but that is not the case. The ensemble cast shines in all the dark corners of the Villa and the ludus due to strong story telling and character development. Anyone who isn't moved by \\"legends\\" to watch \\"the thing in the pit\\" immediately after wards just doesn't know a good story when one is being shown to them.    While the characters are based on true people the events are mostly fictitious so a history lesson this is not. However it is grand story telling in the form of film and if you watch the entire first season you will be rewarded with a unapologetic tale of freedom. I highly recommend this series to any adult that enjoys a journey of the heart, mind and soul.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|I rented this movie from blockbuster thinking that it would be the typical slightly above average, typical direct to dvd superhero movie. I was absolutely WRONG! This movie was very dark, action packed, good story line and the acting was pretty good as well. This kind of reminds me of \\"Batman the animated series\\" of the 90's except with an almost PG 13 rating. Warner Bros. should definately keep the directors, composers, and the same crew if they were to give us a sequel or a prequel to this movie. I'm actually curious to how the the directors would portray Catwoman, Penguin and the other villians in the movie. It left me wanting to see more, which is rare with some direct to dvd movies. It would be pure heaven if there was a animated series as this movie. Great Job, I was definately suprised of how good this movie turned out to be!
0765326353|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a great big fantasy epic. I read Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy, which I liked, but not without some irritation. And this is supposed to be book one of a ten book series!<br /><br />Well, I guess I'll be waiting for the next nine books to come along, because while this was not a perfect book, it was what a fantasy epic should be, which is entertaining and original from start to finish. It's got all the hallmarks of epic fantasy -- gods, heroes, villains, powerful magic, ancient artifacts, political intrigue, kingdoms rising and falling, prophecies and visions and End Times a' comin'... but Sanderson has actually created an original world that does not feel in any way Tolkienesque, nor does it resemble your usual vaguely medieval European fantasy setting. He's designed everything about his world in immense detail, and it's about as alien as can be while still hosting a recognizably human civilization.<br /><br />It's a great (though very long) read. The characters are all likable (even some of the villains). My complaints are that there was too much filler, including some minor characters who got one single chapter each, and I have no idea if they're meant to be recurring characters, and that (as is the nature of big epic fantasies) Sanderson left a lot hanging at the end of this book, and I suppose this will continue in each succeeding volume. There is also something just a little too orderly and planned about his magic and cosmology, the trait of an author who has spent a lot of time playing RPGs and thinks in terms of rules and \\"magic systems.\\" But this didn't take away from the high fantasy feel and some people probably prefer that kind of \\"logical\\" fantasy world, as opposed to a more mythic one where the powers and beings are more nebulous and undefined. By the end of this book, we have a pretty good idea of the \\"rules\\" of the world, but I expect a lot of new stuff to pop up in book two.<br /><br />So, read this if you love big epic fantasy novels and are willing to become invested in a story that's only just getting started after a thousand pages.d are willing to become invested in a story that's only just getting started after a thousand pages.

The book is filled with great advice (how to temporarily hem your jeans, how to keep underarm areas of your white shirts white, etc.) and gorgeous pictures!

0553805371|2.0|Stephen Hawking's new book 'The Grand Design' makes an interesting read. It is an informative but popular book about contemporary theoretical physics, stimulating, witty and, with its magnificent artwork, aesthetically as well as intellectually pleasing.    Eight chapters take you on a journey starting with the ancient Greeks and ending with M-theory. On the way complicated ideas such as quantum theory, relativity, super-gravity, the anthropic principle (both weak and strong), as well as questions as to the relevance of God for science and why we exist, are clearly discussed.  I recommend this book to those who have a basic background in physics but you might also consider reading Brian Greene's 'The Elegant Universe' which covers the same material with equal clarity but more depth. Finally, as could be expected, 'The Grand Design' does not give a better answer to the meaning of life than that already supplied by Monty Python or Douglas Adams.     Is the book without blemish? Unfortunately not. Regrettably the publishers seem to think that anyone reading a book on quantum and space-time physics will be bewildered by the concept of 10 raised to a power and will feel happier if some temperatures are given in Fahrenheit. Furthermore there are two self-inflicted problems, one minor, the other not quite so.  Let us start with the minor problem.    The book starts with a flourish. \\"Philosophy is dead\\", we are told; \\"Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery\\". This initial lack of  modesty is backed-up by an occasional outbreak of Aristotle-bashing. According to the authors the old man with the beard \\"didn't make definite predictions, and when [he] did, the predictions weren't always in agreement with observation. One of these predictions was that heavier objects should fall faster because their purpose is to fall.\\"     But unfortunately for Messrs Hawking and Mlodinow heavier things do fall faster as any underweight member of a sky-diving group will certify. They know that it is difficult to hold hands in a circle when descending with their more corpulent companions because 'fatties fall faster'. Indeed Newton's equations are adequate to show why. Similarly-shaped objects but of differing mass will fall at equal rates in a vacuum (which neither Aristotle nor the authors believe in) but in air the heavier ones come down quicker. So 1 point to Aristotle, 0 points to the two contemporary physicists. (This is a reason to buy the first edition because such an embarrassing blunder will certainly disappear in revised versions.)    Steven Weinberg described in chapter seven of his book 'Dreams of a Final Theory' the annoyance that philosophy can cause physicists. Unfortunately such explanations are lacking in 'The Grand Design'. Furthermore the demonstration that the authors are capable of scoring home-goals gives the impression of haste and superficiality and make us wary to accept uncritically other statements. And rightly so because the second problem is less trivial.     At the very beginning of the book it is suggested that we should adopt 'model-dependent realism' to understand our universe. According to the authors what is important is that a theory correctly predicts things which can be observed. If two theories \\"accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather, we are free to use whichever model is most convenient.\\" If  you take them literally then what they are saying is something like:   it does not matter if one theory uses electron, quarks and bosons to predict a result and the other utilizes little green men with bongo sticks; if both methods make accurate predictions which conform to our experiences when tested then both are equally valid and both are equally 'real'.     Now if a theory is real so too must be the entities that that theory uses. By 'real' I mean  that there is a correspondence between an entity which we define in our theory (like mass, electron orquark) and something in the world which exists independently of us. For so-called 'scientific realists' electrons are not a convenient fiction: they really do exist. But if everything that makes the correct predictions is equally real, as the authors seem to suggest, then this can only be good news for little green men with bongo sticks. (Even taken literally Messrs Hawking and Mlodinow would not be advocating something new - it's called 'constructive empiricism' - although its followers normally remain agnostic about the possible reality of  theoretical entities.)    Of course Hawking and Mlodinow do not believe this, they are full-bloodied scientific realists (like the vast majority of us). They believe there is a real world out there full of stuff that we can comprehend through science and they testify to this in the rest of their book by speaking of electrons, photons, and quarks in the same breath as footballs and rubber ducks on water. For them even when two theories predict the same result one can be superior; for example, even at low velocities Einstein mass is an improvement on Newton's definition because it is a better description of reality, (or - and just to be provocative - what Aristotle would have regarded as the 'essence' of mass).    Much later in the book it becomes clear why the authors attach such importance to a 'model-dependent reality'. We are told \\"It could be that the physicist's traditional expectation of a single theory of nature is untenable, and there exists no single formulation.\\" Instead of a 'theory of everything' it is suggested we could use the family of theories collectively known as M-theory. Each individual theory successfully predicts observable phenomena in its own domain and each agrees with its neighbors on predictions where they overlap. We are given the impression that M-theory is like one-stop-shopping: a place where you can find the theory that fits your particular, if limited, requirement. (Unfortunately very little else is discussed in the book about M-theory, although we are assured it is the ultimate solution.)    Now it could be that the 'model-dependent reality' approach is appropriate in string theory. This is far removed from the microscopic concepts like electrons and photons we normally use. But its general use, and this is what is advocated in the beginning of the book, is a problem because it is a body-blow to scientific realism. It means that the same entity could be a flat plate in one theory and a tortoise in another. Only where two theories overlap is it turtles all the way down! In other words there is nothing fundamental, nothing thought-independent, about any entity used in these theories. Each time you change theories you get new entities. And the entities are new because they have different properties. Entities are defined through their properties (Newton's mass has different properties than Einstein's) so if the properties change so too does the entity. The plate first becomes a turtle then a tortoise. Everything is metamorphic and everything changes according to the theory you wish to use.      As for God, well the authors' concept seems not to have progressed further than the beginning of Genesis. Einstein was once asked if he believed in God. He replied that he believed in Spinoza's God. However Messrs  Hawking and Mlodinow would have to read philosophy to understand why this response might be more profound than their answer.
159102594X|1.0|I'm usually not one to dive in like this on a review, but I'm giving it 1 star only because it needs some sort of balance. I have never felt the reviews on something were so far from the mark, I have even speculated astro-turfing.<br /><br />Characterization is always difficult for any author, and it is evident this is his first published story. His characters have all sorts of unique things, but this does not make them good! A good character has to be compelling, but what we are presented with are completely uncompelling. While they are all full of flaws and nifty unique things, this alone is not enough to make a story! Unfortunately, none of them were believable or empathetic. By the end of the book (which I had to force myself to complete, and then only because I purchased it), I /still/ could care less about all of the characters.<br /><br />I suspect I'm a bit frustrated because there was a lot of potential, and it just never came to fruition.<br /><br />Plot is the next unfortunate failure to this book. 3/4-the way through the book and I still had no idea what was going.  NO IDEA. The entire book is basically the setup for the fellowship of the ring. The book ends when they all get together and are ready to go fight the evil. 90% of the book could have been cut to make way for the next story, but I felt like it had to be there so it was long enough to make the magic trilogy.<br /><br />Sure, he does a decent job with his prose. But overall, I feel completely let down. Perhaps the praise raised my expectations, but in my opinion this book does not leave the basic bucket of event-driven fantasy that has no plot and no characterization. This is basically like a Gary Gygax or R.A. Salvatore book--although with a little bit better prose (actually, Salvatore can spin some pretty good prose from time to time, but has had years of practice).<br /><br />If you want a comparison to a well plotted first-run fantasy book, try The Lies of Locke Lamora. Unfortunately, his characters too are not very sympathetic, although even in that they are better than those in this book.although even in that they are better than those in this book.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Another great book by Ken Follett. Suggest the critics regards the Kindle price write one as good and charge five dollars for it.....
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This version is wonderful, however I don't recommend you buy it. BECAUSE, coming in December is the complete, fully restored version courtesy of the Murnau Foundation who located an original reel of the movie in their museum archives!
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I'm quite the eclectic individual...I'm primarily a \\"goth\\" so to speak but I'm also into Alternative Rock, Death Metal, Industrial, Early 90's Hip-Hop, 80's R&B, Riotgrrl, Indie and early Emo, Nu-wave, No-wave..etc. I've always appreciated music of all genre's while my peers were stuck in one genre.I've been a Soundgarden fan since \\"Badmotor Finger\\" but really fell in love with \\"Superunknown\\" and \\"Down on the Upside\\" albums. Soundgarden broke up in '97 and I was bummed because I never got to see them, then came Audioslave with 3 members of Rage Against The Machine, at first I thought it was funny because trying to imagine Chris doing Rage songs was amusing as hell to me but I gave Audioslave a chance and didn't like it at all. Then he did some solo albums that were ok in my opinion, but then he came out \\"Scream\\" and again I found this amusing BUT something told me I should listen to it anyway and I actually like this album alot. The beats, melodies and production are really good and the songs stick in my head to where I sing the songs out of nowhere. I understand why people don't like this album because of the Soundgarden legacy, it's sad that people just aren't as open-minded as they think they are.I've grown to admire Chris Cornell even more because of this album and was surprised how well his voice went this the beats. I do think the album would have been cooler with open-tunings and such, I would have brought some Soundgarden elements into this album but again I like this album alot. In my opinion, this is the best work he's done since \\"Down on the Upside\\" and I love that album alot.    So if you're a true open-minded person, give it a listen. If you're stuck on Louder than Love/Bad Motor Finger era...avoid this album.

0525951652|4.0|The book is a historical novel of World War I that focuses on the social upheaval caused by the war as opposed to the war itself, which seems to have disappointed some of the negative reviewers.  It gives some detail about some of the major battles, but will disappoint the avid war buff.<br /><br />This is also not a book that focuses on character development; the characters in this book really seem to exist only to bring us to the various pivotal events and to explain what was going on in the lives of people of different nationalities and classes, sort of like a Canterbury Tales of WWI.  It's an ensemble without any particular main character.  This will disappoint readers who prefer books that are more character centered.<br /><br />I'm not at all a prude but it did become a bit painfully obvious about halfway through the book that the author was trying to rely too much on sex as a method of personalizing his characters.<br /><br />The historical events are accurate, including the details (yes, the British actually marched in formation at The Somme and Paris was saved in part by the taxi drivers).  But in order to bring us to all the pivotal events of this 4-year era while limiting himself to a reasonable number of characters, the author was forced to make the lives of the characters contain quite a few unbelievable coincidences.  This shouldn't matter in my opinion since the characters are mere props, it is the events and their effect on the lives of the people that this book is really concerned with.<br /><br />I think the author does a very good job of showing us how important WWI was to the formation of our modern social structure in a manner that is both informative and enjoyable.
B00062PN6I|3.0|We use these headphones for the studio of a community radio station.  They sound fine and are cheap enough that it is not painful to replace them when they break.  I think it would be a waste to get more expensive phones in our situation since so many people handle them and they are more likely to be broken or damaged by drops or cords being rolled over.  I don't think spending more money would end these issues but only cost us more money.  Good product and perfect for our needs.  For my own use at home I generally go higher quality (and more money).
B0000AUHPK|3.0|I bought this movie to show my class because we were reading it in class.  I previewed the movie prior to showing it to my students because they are only 12 years old.  I found the movie to very loosely based on the novel by Ms. Bronte.  While the actors are quite beautiful in the movie and the setting quite stark and moving, there were too many parts of the novel omited.  I think the part that disturbs me the most is that they really play down the timeframe towards the end of the novel where young Catherine and Hareston fall in love.  I think it is due to the actors not being young in age.  I think this type of novel plays better in a format such as Masterpiece Theater, where they can stretch it over 4 or 5 episodes.  They have not done that yet and it would be incredible.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I ordered Spartacus and i recieved it within three days.very satisfied with the product and service.I will be ordering again from Amazon.com .This is a good movie, but will not recommend for children under 17 years of age.To appreciate this movie and writer a person would need to have a understanding of the harshness of Roman culture and history of a gladiator's life.Very good first season,hope the second season is as good.

B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I have been a fan of Joe Satriani's since 1987. I have NOT really liked his last couple of releases. This one is different. A friend of mine let me borrow his copy and I really liked it. There is a different mix of hard rock and even some bluesy jazz thing on there. I am a VERY firm believer in supporting musicians. In this day when you can download almost anything, I believe that you should support the great musicians and tell the record companies to sign more like them. There are way too many corporate groups that are more marketing than talent. I miss the days where music was REAL music. There was so much energy and going to a concert didn't take a loan to pay for the tickets. You could go to a show and buy a t-shirt for about $40 total! The groups you saw were promoting their new releases. Please, if you are a fan, purchase this release and any other officially released music. We need to take back the air waves and get some good rock and roll and blues on the air!!!!
1439181780|5.0|OK, I've given away Rhonda Byrne's secret - the power behind the law of attraction, of having happiness, health, abundance and miracles in your life - yes, it's LOVE. But Byrne also gives it away on her first few pages. The real power in reading this book is how Byrne offers stories and examples that inspire you to get up and give love and test her premise and experience miracles for yourself.<br /><br />This book is a great follow-up to The Secret. Even though I know \\"the secret,\\" and you may too, we can all think and talk about love MORE and back it up with strong feelings to manifest the lives we want. Byrne gives concrete examples of how to amplify the good feelings of love even when you are down and out, broke, sick and alone. She doesn't do it in a preachy way, but through entertaining storytelling (to me, the best kind of read, whether fiction or non-fiction).<br /><br />With the financial stress level going up around the world, it's time to reach for help, and this book can offer it.<br /><br />There are inspiring quotes spread throughout the book, ranging from Jesus, Buddha and Hippocrates, to 20th century New Thought philosophers.<br /><br />The graphics are equally beautiful and inspiring, making this book a pleasure to delve into. More importantly, it's a great reminder that we don't only have to know about the power of love, we have to practice it.<br /><br />Byrne writes that \\"Gratitude is the bridge from negative feelings to harnessing the force of love!\\" I, for one, am grateful to her for sharing this beautiful book.<br /><br />Namaste!

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I've never been more impressed with a DVD set. Not only does it have a ton of bonus features on the discs but it also has a comic strip that relates to one of the episodes. On top of that, the price was very low for a TV season. Love the series, love the set.
B003FCVF6I|5.0|I've been playing videogames for nearly 25 years, starting with the Atari 2600 and eventually catching the bug when my parents brought home a Nintendo back in 1986, a decision I'm sure they are still regretting to this day. This book provides a very in depth history of games from way back before the Atari era through to the crash of the market to it's rebirth and beyond. The book is written without bias and covers a good smattering of systems and people.     There are a few things that hold this book back from a true 5 star review. For one, it is rather dated. The book ends right before the beginning of the last console generation (PS2, Gamecube, and Xbox) and the last 100 or so pages feels rather rushed and isn't as in depth as the previous sections. Not very much is covered beyond the 16-bit era, leaving it somewhat starved for information in regards to the Saturn and beyond. Also, as far as the Kindle edition goes, it does not have Speech to Text, which is a feature I really like, so not having it is something I feel I should note.     Still, the lack of information later on is very much compensated by the wealth and depth of information earlier in the book. This is a definitive book to learn about the history of video games and how they evolved into what they have today. If it's video game history you seek, then this definitely belongs in your library.
B003EYVY04|2.0|I an not rating the movie itself, here. This is my favorite of the HP movies to date, and I'd give it five stars.    However, I was quite disappointed in the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" materials--particularly in what was missing from this  (and the year 4 UE version)compared to the UE of Years 1 and 2. Both of those packs included a fourth disc containing an extended edition of the movie, something which is absent from Years 3 and 4.    The Special Feature documentaries in these boxes are nice, and they include a cute little picture book and a couple of sepia-tone cards, niether of which add much to the actual value of the pack. The absence of that extended edition version of the movie is a major failure.
1439196834|4.0|This is basically a spoof version of pickup artists' routines manuals such as [[ASIN:0977650529 The Art of the Approach]] and [[ASIN:0061911690 Rules of the Game]], and as such should be considered more of a companion piece to [[ASIN:B002OHDYV4 the show]] than an actual how-to guide because it demonstrates the absurd lengths Barney will go to for his next conquest.  While I'm certain you can pull off The Fireman in the real world because I've been mistaken for one at least twice just by wearing a Boston Fire duty T-shirt I got online, there's no way you're going to find a girl so stupid that she'll fall for The Olympian's lock-in prop of an aluminum foil-wrapped oatmeal raisin cookie posing as an Olympic silver medal.
0316077054|2.0|Beautiful Creatures was an amazing tale of southern life, a gothic love story and left me wanting more- a resolution to this hanging love story, an answer to the questions left in the first book. The sequel, Beautiful Darkness, takes up at the conclusion of the first book, with Lena depressed and angry and pulling away from Ethan. Her character left me confused at the change from the first book; although I get the depression, as she makes her choices through the book they are incongruous with the love between Ethan and Lena that was detailed (and captivated me) in the first book. This book really isn't about Ethan and Lena, it is Ethan's book about how finds Lena when she pulls away and takes off. SPOILER ALERT after Lena takes up with a hot new guy, dumping Ethan and her former lifestyle for a different life entirely, and never consciously makes a choice to go back (she is rescued, rather than deciding she made the wrong choice). I was really liking the potential in Liv for a healthy relationship or long-suffering Ethan! The tale is beautifully crafted again, like the first, but the ending is nothing more than a continuation for the next book, with no resolution, no questions answered, and a couple late add-ons that seem to set up the story arc for the next book (Link getting bitten? Ridley with the arclight? what?). Lena seemingly learns nothing at the end, and Ethan doesn't bother, apparently, to ask about her relationship with John- does she love him? how far did their relationship go? does she still have feelings for him? I find it unbelievable that Poor Ethan would simply pick up where things left off with these pretty important unanswered questions, and have no anger for Lena after the way she treated him. It is revealed why Ethan can \\"hear\\" Lena, but this is not really defined (really, wouldn't Ethan have more questions about what he is and what it means for him?). There is no revelation for Lena- she makes her choice, which isn't really a choice, gets rescued rather than having to fight darkness or wrong decisions, hurts no one and gets her uncle back. Did she learn anything? Doubt it. And the fact that she is even partially dark seems not to flow with her character from the first book. I liked Liv so much better than Lena in this book- a smart, tough cookie with feelings for Ethan who buries them to help him find his butthead of a girlfriend. Amma and the rest of the crew are back, and wonderful! but can't save the lame ending. Color me tired of all the sequels that exist to serve as further sequels, but I really felt let down by this one. While I could not put the book down to find out the conclusion, at the end the only thing I could say was \\"that was IT??\\". I hope that #3 (which OBVIOUSLY is the set up for the end of this one) is the same book, but with an ending.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|There's a lot of you out there saying that this record is essentially a typical \\"Nash-Vegas\\" record.  I don't see it.  There is no band or artist out there in mainstream country making music like this.  Most country singers are performers, while ZBB is a group of incredibly talented MUSICIANS.  This record is amazing, but the songs on it that we previously heard on the live record \\"Pass the Jar\\" don't even come close the the live versions.  They are one of the few bands out there that is truly better LIVE.  They are the new \\"jam band.\\"  They can easily fit in with the likes of Skynard, Grateful Dead, Phish, and Dave Matthews Band.  My only minor complaint about the record is that it has two distinct personalities.  In my opinion, \\"Knee Deep\\" and \\"As She's Walking Away,\\" don't belong on the same record as \\"Quiet Your Mind\\" and \\"Martin,\\" or \\"Keep Me in Mind.\\"  However, it just serves to remind the listener of the range and talent of this band.  If you the want the next Jason Aldean, or Toby Keith, Zac Brown Band isn't for you.  But if you want to nourish your musical appetite with substance, check em out.  You won't be disappointed.

B000C1YPY4|5.0|During the time this album came out a lot of artists such as Jill Scott,Alicia Keys,Musiq Soulchild,Dwele and even R.Kelly were seeking to reconcile the musical goals of the neo-soul movement with the nearly impossible to avoid hip-hop influence. As hip-hop itself was drifting into more of an album medium than a singles one it seemed like that cross pollination of influences could fully function at last. Into this environment came John Legend,a protege of then up and coming hip-hop kingpin Kayne West. Legend was much like a lot of young people doing what he was doing: looking to bring his thick,emotional vocal style with his expressive piano playing and writing with some of the current hip-hop sounds. So what was it that set him apart. Well a lot of his had to do with his performance and presentation. Legend held himself with a strong dignity,tailored himself much in the manner of his mentors in terms of dress and posture and took out a lot of space in his songwriting for some strong concentration on the unqiue type of chord progressions of someone such as Stevie Wonder. The title song along with \\"Alright\\",\\"She Don't Have To Know This\\",\\"Number One\\",\\"I Can Change That\\" and \\"So High all do an excellent job at realizing these influences-most are in the medium dance tempo with plenty of excellent piano work along with some of the more hip-hop inspired rhythms with rappers Snoop Dog and Kayne himself joining in along the way. From there to the family nostalgia celebrating \\"It Doesn't Have To Change\\" with it's strong gospel influences this album showcases the personal journey of John Legend himself,from the apologetic womanizer he comes off as at the beginning of the album to a man reaching maturity regarding love and life in general. He reflects very intelligently and honestly about his carousing ways and presents himself as someone whose had a lot to learn and yet more to come. He also celebrates his newfound success in the same manner with Miri Ben Ari on the gently rousing \\"Live It Up\\" These two aspects jell together on the album hit \\"Ordinary People\\",a beautifully played soul ballet of sorts featuring John accompanying himself on piano with lyrics that actually find him fully realizing his romantic sensabilities and the pros and cons of human nature. It's not only one of the strongest numbers here but a glue that holds everything together well. From this point on John Legend would (and continues to) grow and experiment musically and conceptually by leaps and bounds,often with astounding results. And for the most part this album fullfilled his wishes except,purposfully so for a few here and there that way he'd continue to have something to strive for.n Ari on the gently rousing \\"Live It Up\\" These two aspects jell together on the album hit \\"Ordinary People\\",a beautifully played soul ballet of sorts featuring John accompanying himself on piano with lyrics that actually find him fully realizing his romantic sensabilities and the pros and cons of human nature.

B000NVT0RU|3.0|Worthy memorial to forgotten North African soldiers of WW II<br /><br />*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'Days of Glory' is similar to Spike Lee's 'Miracle at St. Anna' as both films deal with the subject of a minority group's contribution to the war effort in World War II. In Lee's film, the focus is on African-Americans and in 'Days of Glory', Arabic-speaking North Africans. The value of both films are that they chronicle the little-known history of discrimination against these minority group soldiers despite all their sacrifices made during wartime.<br /><br />Toward the beginning of the film, the North African soldiers win a small victory when a Captain rescinds the decision not to serve them tomatoes as part of the their daily rations on a transport ship. But more egregious examples of discrimination which are not reversed are shown such as allowing native 'white' Frenchmen leave while the North Africans get none. Similarly, the whites are always promoted to a higher rank and the Africans always remain in the same subordinate positions. Further resentment is bred when the news media sends pictures and newsreels back home of the white soldiers, giving the false impression that they were the ones doing most of the fighting when in actuality it was the North Africans who were responsible for the bulk of the hand-to-hand combat. The ultimate indignity is referenced at the end of the picture when we learn that all pensions of the North African soldiers were frozen following independence of the French colonies. It's my understanding that this injustice has not been redressed, even to this day.<br /><br />'Glory' focuses on four soldiers at the beginning of their conscription in North Africa, their initial foray into Italy in 1944 and finally, combat operations against the Germans in France proper. We meet Said, an impoverished Algerian goat farmer who signs up despite the protestations of his mother who fears she'll lose him in combat. The actor who plays Said, Jamel Debbouze, actually has one arm in real life, and must keep the missing appendage in his pocket throughout the film in order to maintain the illusion that he's not handicapped. It turns out that Debbouze is actually one of the film's producers who contributed a bit of money to the film's production, so it appears they could not avoid using him.<br /><br />The trick in a movie like this is to avoid hagiography by showing each soldier with an inner life and enough conflict between them to keep things interesting. Perhaps the least successful is the character of Messaoud who falls in love with a French woman and is thwarted by the military censors when the letters he sends to her are never received. The other thing we learn about Messaoud is that he joins the majority of the other soldiers in the unit, taunting Said after Staff Sergeant Martinez makes him his orderly. Said puts a knife to Messaoud's throat as he can no longer endure the taunts which imply that he's Martinez's 'girl'. Messaoud eventually goes AWOL due to the aforementioned discriminatory leave policy in an attempt to see his French lover. He's restored after the brass realize they cannot dispense with his skills as a marksman.<br /><br />Corporal Abdelkader proves to be the film's protagonist. He becomes a corporal after taking an exam (equivalent to a lieutenant in the US Army) and becomes the voice for the rights of the native African minority soldiers. Abdelkader faces Sgt. Martinez down on the ship, winning the right to have the tomatoes served to the men. Later, he's put in the brig after getting into a fight with Martinez over the Army leave policy (instead of the soldiers getting leave, they're forced to watch a French ballet performance inside a tent). Despite Abdelkader's militancy, he's also loyal to France and proves to be courageous in battle. So it's quite sad to see how he's not recognized at war's end and ends up a defeated, lonely man living in a small flat in France,far from his homeland.<br /><br />There's also Yassir, a Moroccan of Berber extraction (one of the Moroccan 'Gourmier' soldiers) who joins in the soldering for the money. There's a good scene where another soldier prevents him from bashing in the mouth of a dead German soldier and extracting his gold fillings. Later, Yassir is devastated when his brother is killed in combat.<br /><br />Perhaps the best character in the film is Sgt. Martinez, the 'Pied Noir' (a French national whose ancestors probably were of Spanish extraction who had settled in Algeria). Martinez considers himself thoroughly French and does not want to be associated with the Arab culture. When Said discovers a picture of his Arabic mother and asks him about it, Martinez beats him up and warns him not to tell anyone upon pain of death. Martinez gives 'Days of Glory' its flavor as he is almost brutal in the way he treats his troops but at the same time, sticks up for them when dealing with the higher-ups.<br /><br />'Days of Glory' emulates many American pictures in its war scenes. There are some gripping battle scenes and the carnage and horror of war is ably depicted (one unforgettable iconic image shows the soldiers eating a meal with a dead horse in a ditch right in front of them). The battle scene at the end of the picture however, where the unit faces off against a much larger group of Germans in a small town, doesn't really ring true. The Germans march into town, taking no cover, and are picked off too easily by the North Africans.<br /><br />'Days of Glory' is a worthy addition to the pantheon of World War II films. The characters are not all fleshed out but we do learn a great deal of the history of the discrimination endured by these heroic soldiers. Unlike the bloated 'Miracle of St. Anna', 'Glory' feature economical editing coupled with a soundtrack highlighted by some haunting Middle Eastern songs.Moroccan of Berber extraction (one of the Moroccan 'Gourmier' soldiers) who joins in the soldering for the money.

B003TXKSWK|4.0|In the years that both The Roots and John Legend the general world around them had actually returned to a state very similar to the way it was in the late 60's/early 70's. Political and social tensions are running rampant yet again among almost everyone and so it seemed fitting that when these two soulful and funky musical entities got together it would be these issues rather than ones of a romantic nature would be dealt with. After seeing a sneak peak video about the making of this album I was convinced that Legend,Questlove and Malik Yusef were on yet another mission of \\"saving music\\" here and sacrificing high quality production values and original material by spouting a \\"real instrument\\" only ethic while interpreting songs by Curtis Mayfield,Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. As commendable as this goal was it often has the effect of diminishing the music itself when it's bogged down with such heavy baggage so I tossed it aside. Upon hearing parts of it I decided to give this album a chance and,I must admit it's not quite what it's own hype was delivering on. True it isn't perfect and on some occasions the \\"naturalness\\" ethic does stick out more than it should. But the very fact that this album will DEFINATELY not \\"save music\\" is actually part of it's charms. This album is made up primarily of cover versions of message centered songs such as \\"Hard Times\\",\\"Compared To What\\",\\"Hang On In There\\",\\"Wholy Holy\\" and an 11 minute version of Bill Withers anti war story song \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\". Legend brings a lot of passion and life vocally to these songs and the music is genuinely funky with it's scratch guitars and basslines,even if the live drums are played by Questlove in a somewhat hollow manner. On the other hand some of the lumbering,downbeat nature of these songs may not make them quite as condusive to \\"partying your troubles away\\" much the way the originals are. And that is where the saving music ethic comes in; John and The Roots seem to take these songs a little too seriously to infuse them with much joy and hope. A bit more potent in that respect are the Yusef penned \\"Little Ghetto Boy\\", a wonderfully poetic groove that tells it's story with a glimmer of hope for the character involved. Same goes for the albums closer in the gospel fueled \\"Shine\\",same going for the reggae jam \\"Humanity (Love The Way It Should Be)\\". There are elements to the album that will detract from it's appeal to some and a lot of them have to do with the way the artists themselves come at the music. But considering the very uneven quality of John Legends previous album [[ASIN:B001E7OO2I Evolver]] this could be the start of something big in terms of rediscovering a positive musical direction for all parties involved.s seem to take these songs a little too seriously to infuse them with much joy and hope.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Hereafter is a movie that makes you think in many different way. It is trully a movie that should and will be watched many times. Death is a topic that makes most people nervous but this movie puts into a light that I have never seen. I just say it at the theaters and I came out of the movie astonished. I am personally afraid of death but this movie did not give me that sense. I would say this is the perfect movie that all movies should be like...
0743517849|5.0|I had starting reading the book a while back and finally put it aside as it was dry reading material.  The cd however is quite good.  There are a lot of statistics to support the methods and successes of various types of millionaires.  The stories behind the statistics are interesting as they personalize the numbers to see into the life of how certain people became or are becoming millionaires.  It can help to take a closer look at ones own life to see if they are taking steps to become a millionaire or need to make some changes.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|This is a great Robin Hood movie. I like the fact it gives the background of the legend. This movie has a good amount of action. I think the actors were well chosen for their parts. I hope they bring out the next part of this saga and play up the romance part.
0312600844|1.0|I wasn't going to go near another Jonathan Franzen novel, but the review in The Times and Maureen Corrigan on Fresh Air hooked me on the idea that this novel actually had something to it.  Wrong.  It has nothing.  Nothing.  And by the time one gets past the labored dialog, the soap opera that masquerades as a plot, and by far the worst writing about sex anyone has ever attempted, this reader just felt scammed the way that Patty lied to Walter, and Walter lied to the public, and Richard lied to everyone, and Joey lied to himself.  The novel is one, long time suck.  That it does well.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Season II as good as Season I.  This show is fabulous.  Am ordering Season III now!
0374158460|2.0|Like \\"The Corrections,\\"  Franzen returns with a group of protagonists that decidedly are not the type of people you would \\"like to go camping with,\\"  even his \\"Green\\" protagonist, Walter, is someone who wallows in so much self pity that it is nauseating.  You could almost \\"forgive\\" his equally self possessed wife, Patty, for cheating on him (with yet another narcissistic character--and Walter's supposed best male friend, Richard Katz, a \\"troubled\\" don't wanna be 'rock star' who builds decks in the off season) if Patty herself was the least bit likable.  (After it all, I found myself almost feeling 'sorry' for her college roommate Eliza---which in itself is saying A LOT).      If you like any of these characters, there's something decidedly wrong with you.  Their offspring don't seem much better... their son, Joey, apparently a misguided attempt by Mr. Franzen to 'indict' conservatism under the Bush administration, is silly and leads us in a misadventure in Paraguay chasing down truck parts for the war in Iraq (too much coffee that day, Jonathan?) ... perhaps fortunately little is said about their daughter, Jessica, although she seems destined to follow in daddy's footsteps.  Walter's ultimate \\"romantic\\" interest --other than his birds--Lalitha probably never knew how lucky she was to have met her 'fate' and be done with all of them.       Oprah also would have been better served if Mr. Franzen would have continued in his failure to appear on her show.  She  should have picked a \\"true classic\\" for her insipid book club... like say, for instance, \\"Moby Dick\\".... Ahab at least had a certain goal in mind.  Franzen's characters are better left shivering in the cold to die.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|Street Hawk was an excellent 80's scifi/action/adventure show. While the show may have been overshadowed by Knight Rider and Airwolf, Street Hawk held its own ground and provided great entertainment. Sure, some of the dialogue was sappy/corny at times...but in my opinion, this was a reflection of the (Don't Worry Be Happy) 80's and all good fun. And hey...since the show only lasted for 13 episodes, we never had to sit through an evil alter ego episode (eg. Michael Knight/Garth Knight...that was very imaginative writing...hello).    This DVD release is great. The extras are nice (includes cast interviews, making of, unaired pilot, etc.). The video quality is good...and did I mention the soundtrack? The theme music and some of the incidental music in the show was provided by Tangerine Dream (an awesome German electronic music/krautrock group). This music was a perfect match for this high tech/high energy show.    Look...if you like motocross mixed with machine guns, rockets, lasers and computer assisted super speed...then Street Hawk is for you. You will believe a motorcycle can fly!!!
0061537969|5.0|This book kicked up every single emotion in me.  I laughed out loud and cried out loud as well.  When it was finished it took everything I had not to sleep on the floor embracing my 12 year old Golden Retriever.  Get the book but don't forget the tissues!!!!!
B003EYVY0E|1.0|I pre-ordered these (3&4) after getting the first 2 Ultimate Editions on Blu-Ray.  I am very disappointed to discover that they have NO additional footage.

0312600844|5.0|So much has been said and written about this book- perhaps the biggest novel of the year- that I'll keep my two cents simple and direct. I'm not sure it deserves all its praise, but it does deserve a great deal of it. It's modern and old-fashioned. It's overlong and a joy to read. Some sections don't make sense, but are written with such skill that you don't care. The dialogue comes out of the characters in fits and bursts, and sounds remarkably true to life. Franzen luxuriates in beautiful character development for hundreds of pages, sometimes veering into excess but the majority of the time making it sound and feel just right. However, therein lies my one gripe with the book; sometimes Franzen throws something in about a character just for the sake of differentiating them from others, at the expense of their sudden affectation not making sense with the person the reader has gotten to know. But in the end this is a small quibble in this fascinating brick of a book, one impressed with its heft and themes but not in the least subjugated to them. Highly recommended.
0375703764|5.0|This was the best book that I have read in a long time. Danielewski takes the reader on a great journey through the lives of three individuals that are struggling with the events that occur in the novel. It was the type of book that I just couldn't put down. Since I've finished reading I have recommended it to many people and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of their taste.
193413712X|4.0|Tinkers came out of the blue to win the Pulitzer, much to the surprise of countless award prognosticators. Up to that point it seems to have been the small, quiet, special book known only to a select few. If you strip away its sudden fame, you have a lovely story told with obvious talent and a spiritual sense of precision. George's life and impending death is told in snatches of human thought; sounds, feelings, and random memories come up to the surface and leave as quickly as they came. As one man's take on human consciousness in the midst of suffering it is incredibly successful and moving. For a novel, however, there felt like there was something ever so slightly missing that connected the threads together to make the book as powerful as its opening suggests. Still, it is serious American literature, and a welcome release from books which tell instead of show, and filled throughout with a transitory sense of familiarity which is too rare in modern fiction.
0553110098|5.0|If you have never read this classic, you should read it. If you read it long ago, you should read it again.<br /><br />Clifton Fadiman, one of the 20th century's foremost critics, is said to have read 25,000 books in his lifetime, many more than once. \\"When you re-read a classic,\\" he said, \\"you do not see more in the book than you did before; you see more in you than there was before.\\" I've read Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men probably a half-dozen times since I first read it as a teenager. Each time, as a reader, I connect more with the characters than I did the last. And each time, as a writer, I learn something more about the stories I want to write.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|I love the show and was so excited to get the this soundtrack! I was a little disappointed that they didn't put \\"All I Need\\" by Within Temptation like another reviewer said but it is still a great cd. My 12 year old daughter loves it as well and we don't usually agree on music. My favorites are \\"Cut\\" by Plumb and \\"Bloodstream\\" by Stateless.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|I really loved my Zagg shield for my iPhone 3. After a year or more it's still holding up well. It's absolutely useless on the iPhone 4 though if you use it in addition to a slider case to protect the back and sides. The Zagg film comes apart around the edges as soon as the iPhone 4 is inserted into the sleeve. The only way you can use the Zagg with these slider cases (I'm using incase Slider Case) is to crop the Zagg with a razor blade or something before applying it to the face of the iPhone 4.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I never write reviews but I felt compelled to write one for Modern Family. I've only recently started watching the show and it really is the best show on TV right now. I've never laughed so much watching a show but this one keeps me laughing from beginning to end. I never, ever buy TV shows on DVD but since I missed Season 1 entirely, I had to buy the DVD. I have to say that, hands down, this is one of my favorite shows EVER.
0061914177|3.0|As he said early in the book; that it is HIS personal passion is \\"creating businesses\\". Later in the book he said that doing what you love is the SMALL part of all this, and that \\"marketing\\", \\"building a community\\", \\"branding\\" etc, is the LARGE time consuming part. Which is OK for him since that latter part (creating businesses) is his passion. For most of us we cant stand the latter part, are not any good at it, nor really want to be, but just love DOING our passion. So we wouldn't actually be doing what we love instead we'd be busy making a business out of it (completely seperate thing). Does that make sense?     I'm not saying you cant make your passion pay, which is the point of the book, but it will come with doing a lot of stuff you don't actually like doing which kinda takes all the \\"passion\\" out of it.     Saying all that i do like gary, good guy, very motivational.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are great, especially for sub $100. Sound seems flat and have a good response at all frequencies. These are not boomy but yet can produce low and detailed bass.  No need for an amp, the low impedance makes these great even for portable devices. They are light and I don't notice any discomfort after several hours of wearing them. For around the ear type headphones they are also not big or unsightly.  I have owned several headphones at this price range and so far like these the best.  I also like the even and accurate sound they produce over my friends more expensive (+100) Audio Technica, Bose and Senn's. I am picking up a second pair for the office so I don't have to carry them back and forth. BTW, these are closed headphones meaning they block out sound around you and do not bleed sound out. They are good enough that at a fairly high volume no one will know what you are listening to or the volume they are at. This is a plus for when I use them at work or in bed. I am not saying they are noise cancelling, but if your looking to be more aware of your environment I suggest an open air style headphone over these.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Just finished this book after seeing it repeatedly show up at the top of my Kindle best-seller list, and in my Amazon emails.  Boring!  Plus, I think it was either terribly written, or terribly translated.<br /><br />I just don't believe that modern Swedes talk the way the dialogue is written.  Who \\"sacks\\" someone in the corporate world?  When do adults, in seriousness, say something is \\"dead as a doornail\\"?<br /><br />The underlying story is interesting and somewhat creative, but the way it was articulated left far too much for desire.  I couldn't wait to get it over with to start a new book.  And I will most certainly not be reading any of the other books by this author.<br /><br />It's not worth your money.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Joe has been hit and miss for years in his CD's producing great tracks here and there, but also a lot of filler.  This CD is consistent in EVERY track.  It is not about playing a million notes a second and showing off shredding skills.  It is about making good music, letting other musicians have their say, not overplaying.  I put this on and listen over and over again.  I went to his website and watched all the podcasts.  It is a great thing to get a new bassist and bring in the keyboards.  This CD makes me feel alive again.  Five stars all the way!
B003TY1364|5.0|Cameron Crowe's JERRY MAGUIRE is a rarity: a romantic film with an NFL setting. The picture's most memorable line, \\"You had me at 'hello,\\" belongs to Miss Zellweger, with Mr. Gooding's \\"Show me the money!\\" a close second. This near-perfect blend of comedy and drama is enhanced by an extensive and varied music track, fine acting and unusual sports figure cameos.<br /><br />Here, super-agent Jerry is fired from the company he helped found for publishing a mission statement that stresses providing more personal attention to a smaller roster of star athletes. Dorothy Boyd is struck by the beauty of Jerry's message. She quits her accconting job at the same firm and together Jerry and she set out to conquer the sports agency world, starting with a single client, little-used wide receiver Rod Tidwell. The undersized Rod has a head almost too big for his helmet. He wants the Arizona Cardinals to pay him several million more than the team's owner thinks he's worth.<br /><br />Jerry likes the widowed Dorothy a great deal and he totally loves her precocious six-year-old son, Ray. When Dorothy plans a move to San Diego, the matrimony-phobic Jerry asks her to marry him. It soon becomes obvious that as a husband he's a great sports agent. Jerry must simultaneously deal with a rapidly deteriorating marriage, his inability to sign new clients and Rod's demands for a long term contract from the Cards.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.<br /><br />(7.2) Jerry Maguire (1996) - Tom Cruise/Cuba Gooding Jr./Ren&eacute;e Zellweger/Kelly Preston/Jay Mohr/Bonnie Hunt/Jonathan Lipnicki/Glenn Frey/Donal Logue/Beau Bridges (cameos: Al Michaels/Dan Dierdorf/Frank Gifford/Drew Bledsoe/Katarina Witt/Mel Kiper/Drew Rosenhaus/Art Monk/Richie Kotite/Troy Aikman/Warren Moon/Kerry Collins/Dallas Malloy)

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have had my 405 for more than a year now.  Suddenly, the battery will only last for 4 hours.  I discovered this during a marathon (!!), and it has't lived beyond 4 hours since.  Unfortunately, I can't finish a full marathon under 4 hours....  so looks like I will get a new watch. I had the 205 and the 305 with great results.  I was looking forward to this watch -- it does have a better weight (the 305 made my hand go numb after long distances)and I don't even mind the bezel too much.  However, I do very much mind the fact that it only lasts 4 hours after an initial year of use.  Could be because you can't turn the @!!** thing off, so the battery is constantly in use --- also, you can't fully drain the battery to recharge because you can't go out for a long run with just a partial charge.  Really bad product... for the money I expected much more.  Stay away!!

B002ZG98LO|4.0|I'm pretty much in lock step with most of the folks who saw the value of this movie. What really made it for me was the Samurai sword fight between the Yakuza member of the \\"hunted\\" party and the second predator. It was beautifully photographed at night with great lighting and certainly rates right up there with the Uma Therman / Lucy Lu scene at the end of Kill Bill Volume 1. The top down shot at the end of the battle was especially good. I also enjoyed the respect for the Bushido each combatant showed for the other in classic samurai style. It was an elegant serene moment in am otherwise completely chaotic scene. If you are a fan of Samurai movies be sure and look for it. Overall this movie was much better than brainless violence and 2 dimensional script that I anticipated (thanks to Adrian Brody), it had some surprisingly creative moments.
B002ZG9846|4.0|A teenager dreams of becoming a superhero. In his quest he makes unlikely friends, takes on big foes but ultimately fulfils his dreams with the aid of other superheroes.<br />In short, this is a very enjoyable and comical movie with excellent direction. The movie's real star is the little girl played by Chloe Moretz. A lot of viewers have found her character and dialogue objectionable for an eleven year old, including the profanity but this is a movie and in my opinion should not be taken seriously. I loved the movie and cannot wait to see the second part. 10/14/10

B001GCUO5W|3.0|Inception was a mind bender of a movie and people loved it but I fail to understand that the same people have ignored a similar themed Shutter Island. Based on Dennis Lehane's book Shutter Island is the story of two U.S. Marshalls, who go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patients Rachel Solando who has disappeared from a mental asylum on that island.  The duo set out to investigate the mysterious happenings and confront a shocking ending.<br />I thought the movie was excellent in all respects and a great adaptation of a fine book. It is hard to adapt great books but the movie does just that. The direction was first rate which was expected of a director like Martin Scorcese. Leonardo Caprio delivers a fine performance and I think is on his way to become one of the finest actors of his generation. The end of the movie was haunting and the viewer has to watch the movie carefully or twice to understand the twister. If you cannot, I suggest watch the making of instead. I loved the film. 3 stars.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This novel meant a lot to me, maybe more than it probably should have. It's not the most well written piece of all time (for various reasons), but it's so endearing. I cared so much for the protagonist that I became emotionally involved in the book. Which is interesting if you think about it, because Christopher wasn't the most emotionally involved person himself.<br /><br />I think the reason I appreciated this novel so much was because it was about a child with autism. My brother has Asperger's, and I saw many parallels (albeit less extreme) between Christopher and my brother. It made sense to me.<br /><br />The novel portrays Christopher as a somewhat normal autistic boy: he's not a genius, he's not an idiot, he's not something special. He's a \\"normal\\" autistic boy who understands things differently and who fixates on a particular set of things.<br /><br />While the relationship between Christopher's parents is part of the back story, it helps to draw the reader in. We can infer from the very beginning what happened to Christopher's mother, but we find out as he does. We experience the rage, confusion, and heartbreak just as Christopher does.<br /><br />As the sibling of someone who has always been disconnected in some way or who hasn't experienced things the \\"normal\\" and properly socially adjusted way, reading about Christopher's life and how he described the way he felt was not only interesting, but compelling and heartbreaking. Heartbreaking, but only in the sense that it warmed me to understand such a complex and interesting person.

B000GCFY0I|4.0|I'm a little torn about this book being written for a YA audience: it either made it amazing because it didn't overwhelm readers with too much world building and typical scifi junk, or it dumbed down an interesting and original storyline to where it suffered from lack of development.<br /><br />Regardless - fantastic novel. If you can get back the teenage girl telling us the story and deal with words like \\"bubbly\\" and \\"bogus,\\" then it's an excellent novel. It is easy to see why so many adult readers like myself fell for this book. It's fascinating!<br /><br />Tally is an interesting character. She's always asking questions, always trying to do the right thing, always trying to make someone else happy. She thinks she knows what she wants, but gasp! shock! she doesn't, because she's a 16 year old girl. It makes the brain washing done to the uglies and littlies seem less real, less damaging. Like I said: the YA either saved the book from being an explosion of word vomit or shackled it to the constraints of a genre written for angsty teens.<br /><br />The world building is left slack a bit in this installment, but it does pick up a bit more in the second book.
0525951652|5.0|I can't believe that people are still whining about the price of the Kindle version of this book.  The complaint seems to be that the Kindle version should be $9.99 and/or less than the hardcover.  I don't believe that Amazon guaranteed that *every* book appearing as a Kindle e-book would cost $9.99, nor do I believe that they promised the cost would *always* be less than the cost of the physical book.  I really don't understand why people are complaining so bitterly that the author or the publisher are \\"greedy\\".  If you think the Kindle version is too expensive, buy it in hardcover, at a substantial discount, or check it out from your library.  What's the big deal?    Obviously, the whiners would like to read the book or they wouldn't care what it costs, yet by posting their petulant one-star reviews, they're lowering the book's rating.  I came here before buying the book to see what people thought about it, and was concerned because the average rating was so low.  I figured the book must not be very good.  Only after reading the spiteful, angry comments did I discover that the ratings had nothing to do with the quality of the book, but rather its price.      This is not an issue of freedom of expression, it's an issue of where you choose to exercise that freedom. By posting one-star reviews as a form of protest against the cost of a book that you have not yet read, you are disrupting a forum that should contain reviews about the book itself, not its cost.  Yes, you have a right to exercise your freedom of speech here, but in doing so, you are interfering with the right of others to access accurate information.  It would be more fair to others if you complained about the price in the comments section below the reviews.    As for the book itself, I loved it.  I've read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", and this is very much in the same vein, but covering a different time in history.  The story moves at a fast pace, and Follett manages to include enoughhistorical information that I learned a great deal, without getting bogged down.  Even the battle scenes are handled well, giving the reader a sense of the horror of the war while still moving the story along.      I found that the characters were believable and ended up caring about them.  Follett did a particularly good job of making his characters three-dimensional, so that even those with many flaws always had some redeeming features.  I'll be very eager to read the second volume.    As a final note, the quality of the hardcover is outstanding, with a good binding, thick paper and very readable type, so if you're one of those who refuses to buy the e-book because of its cost, I don't think you'll be disappointed with the hardcover.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|I can see why this book got such good reviews: it was written by a reader, for readers. It is about reading and writing as much as it is about sisters, secrets, and ghosts. It is very compelling to read, but I could understand how it could be dull if read over an extended period of time. Overall, it was a good book. But it wasn't a great book.
1439181780|5.0|I bought this after reading her book The Secret because I felt the need to continue soaking up these philosophies as a way to integrate them into my thoughts and behavior patterns. I was amazed to find that, just as advertised, this book IS even more powerful than its predecessor. I won't spoil it by summarizing and then failing to do the concepts justice, but suffice it to say that Rhonda Byrne has distilled these concepts down to their absolute essence and thus packed an even more powerful punch than her first book, The Secret.    As I read I kept recalling a negative review on here wherein someone sarcastically declared that everything in THEIR lives wasn't black and white, good or bad. I expected to find some oversimplifications, perhaps a literary conceit or two, to explain this obvious anger or resentment. However, I did not. I honestly cannot say that I see their point. It's all about how you FEEL, not about dividing things up into categories of judgments. It's not about giving a name to how you feel, either - it's about paying attention to how you feel, and therefore what sort of energy you are projecting on to the world. Even someone -- maybe even especially someone -- w delayed mental development, can feel a feeling and recognize whether they want to experience more of that same feeling. Do I like feeling this way? Do I want to feel this way again tomorrow? should be easy questions to answer.    So, before YOU rush to judgment, too, I highly recommend giving this a try. By the way, I was out of work three months when I read this book. I had put out exactly four resumes in that time because my husband is ill and I just never had time to focus on the effort. Unemployment is around ten percent where I am. Before I got halfway through the book and practicing the concept, I had a decent job offer from one of those four resumes in a town where the average person is unemployed a year and a half before finding a job, and applies to hundreds or thousands of ads. And I barely even focused on finding a job - I am building a home business - but it became apparent a couple of weeks ago that our savings wouldn't hold out while waiting for some of my efforts to bear fruit. So this job is EXACTLY what I need for now. Imagine if I had wanted something high - powered and focused on that! (no high-powered for me, thx.

Change<br /><br />The Platinum Edition is sooo much better than the original version because you get extra tracks and bonus DVD playtime. When I bought the original version of \\"Fearless\\" I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I just bought the new album of Taylor Swift!' But when I was looking around online, I found it funny because it said that she was making a 'Deluxe Version' of \\"Fearless\\" and I was thinking, 'Hm, now this is a shame because I just bought the original version now I just wasted a bunch of money on some lame version of Taylor Swift's album Fearless.' And so I waited and begged my mother to get me that better version of \\"Fearless\\" because just the original version wasn't enough. And so I got it and I was like... 'Merlin's beard! This is one heck of an album and it's soo much better than that one that I've got, woo hoo!' If I were you, I'd get the Platinum Edition rather than the Original Version because that one is a waste of money and fun entertainment.
0385737955|3.0|I have had this one in my TBR pile for ages and I put it off for a long time because I heard so many good things about it and did not want to be disappointed because I read too much hype about it.  James Dashner is coming to town on Monday so it finally motivated me to pick it up.  I blazed through it pretty much in one day which amazed me considering how much time my 3 month old and 3 year old take nowadays.<br /><br />The characters<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about Thomas's character.  I did not actually care for him much but I felt guilty for not liking him.  He came across to me as arrogant and kind of a jerk sometimes.  I know this is a shocking experience and everyone is allowed some hysteria but he was almost unreasonable in the way he demanded answers, did not want to listen to anyone and wanted to do things his way. Yet he had his nice moments when he befriends Chuck and tries to save Minho and Alby so I can't say he was completely unlikeable.  The other main character, Teresa, also felt kind of flat to me.  She was supposed to be a key component to what was going on in the Glade but I did not feel like her character was developed much.  Hopefully we will see more in the next book.  Minho and Newt on the other hand were probably my favorite characters.  Minho wasn't afraid to take charge when needed and stand up for what he believes and Newt just struck me as a really nice, loyal guy.<br /><br />The story line<br /><br />I found this story line fascinating.  Why were these boys sent to the Glade?  What were they supposed to do and why all of a sudden was a girl sent to join them?  I've heard this story compared to The Hunger Games and while it does remind me of it I wouldn't really compare the two.  Where as in The Hunger Games these teenagers are out to kill each other the teens in the Glade work amazingly well together to create a stable environment that enables everyone to live peacefully together.  It was almost unbelievable how well this group of boys managed to create the society they did (the explanation for how they managed this comes later but I don't want to spoil it).<br /><br />The ending definitely leaves you hanging and wanting to pick up the next book to find out what happens.  So although I found a lot of the characters in this book to be flat I enjoyed the premise and cannot wait to read the next one to find out what happens next.society they did (the explanation for how they managed this comes later but I don't want to spoil it).

Cinematography is beautiful, script is masterful, if minimal, the acting is believable, and the overall product is something I would consider artwork. Would definitely buy the movie, having watched the Amazon rental version.

0385738757|5.0|Several people seem to have problems with this amazing 2nd installation of \\"The Maze Runner,\\" but I thought it was outstanding. It was a perfect follow-up to TMR, picking up only a few hours after TMR left off. I think the frustration that people have with it is the same type of frustration that came from a show like Lost... for every answer to a question, 50 more questions pop up. I don't think TST was ever meant to answer more than a few questions, because it is in the middle of a series of books that operate like a maze... they leave you constantly searching to find the answers.    That being said, I thought the book was high energy and non-stop action. I was unable to put it down. In many scenes, I ached for Thomas, because he was the one *really* being tested by those he cared most about. All-in-all, I loved it. Perfect 2nd book, and I cannot wait for a 3rd.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|It's not nearly long enough!! I've never bought a soundtrack in my life, but I know it's only the bits that are actually in the movie. I truly wish that these pieces had been embellished or that more were included, in the movie or not. It's brilliant and makes me happy.     So that makes it all shiny and good and that's my opinion.     And to the rather crabby Amazon reviewer? Yes, I like George Winston, too. Hah!! :)
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I started watching Grey's late, and got confused watching random episodes on TV, so I decided to start from the beginning. When I reached this season, it was not yet on DVD, so I purchased them online. I absolutely love this show. I could watch it all day every day, and I also think this is the best season yet! My boyfriend has even fallen in love with the show, though he would never admit it! I also have my best friend hooked! The characters are so well thought out, after watching the show you feel as though you actually know them! Can't wait to buy the next season!
0439023513|5.0|This was an amazing finale. Tortured characters, tough decisions, and life changing moments. I love the direction Suzanne Collins went in Mockingjay. What an emotional ending to this much loved trilogy! This reader is so sad to see it end.
0380973650|1.0|My other half an I read this book as a night time read. We do this a lot and a book this size usually takes us a couple weeks. This one took us forever because we were so painfully bored with the story and had ABSOLUTELY no love or interest in any single character or story line.<br /><br />This book sounds great on paper: Ancient and modern gods clash in the modern America with a mortal man caught in the middle! Well that plot actually barely stays around. There are so many other stories that come in and out, and innumerable that never finish and just leave you hanging. Or like the handful of short stories called \\"coming to America.\\" Those were so masturbatory! He liked his short stories so much he needed to include them. Because they served NO purpose for the story. Telling us how this person brought their god to America. We understand how they got here, we don't need more of your crappy one dimensional characters.<br /><br />Which cleanly brings up the biggest problem we had with this book. Shadows, the main character constantly had us yelling at him or smacking our foreheads at his reactions and questions when he asked them. He almost never asks any questions when and during the duration of being thrown in with the transplanted gods of the country, and when he does ask questions they're things like, \\"Wednesday was your father?\\" When one of the characters notes \\"The All Father is dead.\\" Using another of Wednesday's names.<br /><br />Just an incredibly painful read and I will never pick up another Gaiman book again.

0312427646|3.0|This is the story of the Queen of England and what would happen if she became obsessed with reading.  You find her reading on her way to parliament and sneaking books into meetings.  You also would find that she would have sent servants to select books for her.  What I found lacking from this story was what does it all mean?  Yes it is interesting to think of the Queen in this manner and to even see what she would expect from meeting authors, but what in the world would it effect?  Would it change how she addresses world hunger or any other issue?  You never find out and the story just ends.  Great start, but poor finish.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|If there was ever a such a thing as an atheist saint, Hypatia would be it. Each year atheists flock to Lake Hypatia (Alabama) for their annual meeting and softball game of atheists vs. agnostics. This movie is a dramatization of historical events. The city of Alexandria was a center for learning. It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?<br /><br />Hypatia was a scientist and philosopher, she is portrayed as an atheist in this film, although her religious belief is uncertain. She may very well had been a pagan. The menstrual cloth she presented to a would-be suitor is recorded in history. The movie is long and at times doesn't move along fast enough. For that reason I downgraded from five stars to four. I thought it needed better editing. Apart from the dramatization, the movie sticks to history. The documentary commentary writing on the screen is white on a predominately white background which made it difficult for me to read with old eyes and an analog TV. I had to pause it.<br /><br />For those of you who loved watching Rachel Weisz's nude hind parts in \\"The Brothers Bloom\\", she once again flaunts her fanny for the screen. Did it get bigger or did they use a body double? Agora is a common word used in crossword puzzles with the clue \\"Greek Marketplace.\\"

1400052173|5.0|I don't usually read non-fiction, but I can't put this down!  If I didn't know it was a true story, I'd think it was SciFi.  Amazing story.  Makes you wonder in awe about what it means to be human.  Then get angry about the cavalier way the dead woman and her family were treated.
B0001JXQDI|5.0|If you have a 5.1 setup in your car or home, don't even think, just get this while you can!  This CD has well mixed surround audio.  Not too much, not too little... just right.   If you have never bought a surround audio DVD before and you have a surround sound setup...you need to experience this!  A great audio demo source for your home theatre system!   Once again the recording industry has harmed itself by allowing two competing technologies (DVD Audio and SACD).   It looks like DVD Audio has gone the way of Beta,  SACD is still hanging on but barely.   SACD requires a special player, while DVD Audio plays in any DVD player.  Why doesn't the music industry mandate the killing of SACD and ressurect DVD Audio and start producing quality surround sound material?  Seems to me that could go a long way towards saving the music industry.  Surround is here to stay.  Who would bother downloading stereo MP3s when you could go purchase a reasonably priced DVD audio with amazing surround?
0393072231|3.0|I found Lewis' book to be a well written piece - filled with stories to help the reader understand what happened during the last decade. However, he only tells part of the story - that which he knows. It does not discuss the problems caused by consumer greed, the contributions of real estate agents and appraisers, mortgage brokers, loan underwriters, and, probably the two most responsible outside of the U.S. Congress, Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac and the rating agencies.  It picks up after the damage was done by the aforementioned groups and dissects the bad behavior of some Wall Street firms and individuals.

0525951652|3.0|This long, long historical novel by a master story teller could have been so much better had the author just taken a bit more time to flesh out the characters. As it stands, however, it's a good story which takes several unrelated principal characters - two Welsh, two British, two German, two Russian and one American - through the years (1914-23) of World War I and its aftermath; and along the way through a thousand pages the reader meets the principal characters of that history - King George V, Winston Churchill, David Lloyd-George, Sir Edward Gray, General Joffre, Generals Von Ludendorff and Hindenburg, Lenin, Trotsky and President Woodrow Wilson to name just a few It's quite well done, though     When you have finished - if you do - you will have been through an explosion in a Welsh coal mine and the consequences in a small village owned by a British company completely indifferent to the welfare of its employees, a Lucullan Victorian banquet for King George V with the menu which is guaranteed to make the reader full before the first of the several courses is over, blow by blow through the incredible and agonizing diplomatic lockstep which led from an accidental assassination in Serbia to a war involving all the European powers two months later, the first Battle of the Somme, the plans of the German High Command, the Russian Revolution in St Petersburg in 1917 , the rise of Lenin to command the new Communist party, Moscow after the Revolution, and the incidents leading to America's entrance in the War in 1917,t he \\"peace\\" Treaty of Versailles and post war Germany during the Weimar Republic.      You will also have read about numerous sexual encounters by most of the characters and have inhaled a sense of what it was to live in these times.  I was never bored. I just wish knew the characters better.     Was the time spent reading this long historical novel worth it? Unequivocally yes.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I LIKE GLADIATOR,I LOVE 300..THIS ONE IS CREME DE LA CREME.I WATCHED THE MOVIE FROM SUNDOWN TO SUNDOWN(yea i missed work n school).  SERIOUSLY IT IS SOME TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION.
B003TML0VO|3.0|The \\"Carlos Santana featuring \\" format which we've now become accustomed to in the last decade has, at best, only occasionally produced good results, and this album unfortunately follows that trend. At least Shaman had some original material on it. By definition, covering the greatest guitar tracks of all time is futile and pointless exercise. That perhaps only a couple of the 12 tracks on this CD would qualify for that accolade is beside the point. I cannot even begin to envision Carlos tackling classics by, say, Metallica or Dream Theatre. His effort at Photograph by (the less heavier) Def Leppard doesn't work; it simply doesn't suit his playing style. A more appropriate Van Halen track than Dance the Night Away would surely have been Eruption or Hot for Teacher, but there's the rub. Yes, it`s hit and miss. Carlos would, in my view, have been far better off choosing from the great body of song material that DOESN'T stand out by virtue of the guitar content and augmenting it in the way that, for example, Jimi Hendrix took Dylan's All along the Watchtower into a new dimension. Another gripe I have is that Carlos loves playing his guitar so much he at times seems to have lost all sense of subtelty on this album. His incessant noodling from the first beat of Riders on the Storm detracted from the suspense; it sounds rushed  and is inferior to the original by a long way. Why he takes on Little Wing is beyond me. Who could hope to top Hendrix himself or the amazing Stevie Ray Vaughan? If anything, I`d have picked another, lesser covered Hendrix track to pay homage to that god of the strat. Enough of the criticism, though. I quite like the rap version of Back in Black; it`s different and that's ok. The opening track Whole Lotta Love with the great Chris Cornell on vocals is brilliant and, for me, probably the highlight. Don't get me wrong: this album is pleasantly listenable, if all too familiar-sounding. It has some nice touches, but it`s light years removed from the ingenuity of Caravanserai or Abraxas and 3 stars is about all I can honestly award this all-star ensemble.
0859537978|5.0|The words in this version of the book are slightly different than what we usually sing but my daughter loves it anyway.  For example, we sing \\"all through the town\\" and this book says \\"all day long\\" and our driver says \\"move on back\\" while the book's driver says \\"tickets please\\".  Not a problem, it's just different.  The pictures are hilarious and the holes are awesome!  They integrate into each page so well.  Plus my daughter gets a kick out of the last page where everyone on the bus goes to a party.  Definitely a great purchase!
1439133948|5.0|Another lovely adventure in the Vorkosigan universe. While including enough information to make it readable for a new reader, Ms. Bujold kindly included updates on all the characters her familiar readers are anxious about. Though perhaps the Fate of the Universe may not have hung in the balance, I enjoyed the adventure. Not all books must be emotional roller coasters after all. Though the ending. . . Well. *Sigh* I shall not spoil it only to say that I really didn't see it coming.   The included CD Rom was awesome! It includes all her previous Miles books in electronic form. Baen also is kind enough to put the books in multi-formats including rtf (hello word processor) so those of us who haven't got an iPad, Kindle, Sony Reader, etc. can still enjoy them. Other publishers could stand to learn a thing or two from Baen.   I really, really hope that this isn't the last book on Miles. It didn't feel like the last one, but then I don't think any of them would.
0553573403|2.0|I finished reading this book several weeks ago but thought I would let some time go by before writing about it.  Perhaps that was a mistake in that already I can no longer recall a lot of details with which to defend my rating.  But perhaps also the fact that I was not sufficiently motivated to write about it right away or can remember overmuch speaks to the book's limitations.<br /><br />Mr. Martin writes well in that, particularly at the outset, I was strongly motivated to read on.  The world he creates is palpable, even \\"atmospheric,\\" and the characters have enough complexity that they seem real, at least at first.  But as I read on, a kind of gloom settled over me.  There is so little to like here!  There is so much gratuitous cruelty!  The characters are entirely absorbed by the diminished content of their own thoughts, world-views, or appetites!  Divinity could be moving in their very midst and they would never perceive it!<br /><br />If I live another 20 years or so, I will beat the actuaries.  With so little time and so much possible enjoyment to be had from a good book, I find no movitation to read anything further in this series despite Mr. Martin's talent for writing.
B003VS0CYC|3.0|I already have the Robocop Trilogy on DVD.  I bought this blu-ray version of the box set because I was expecting to see an improved High Definition re-master.  And it's not.  This transfer to Blu-Ray looks no better than the DVD's.  So, it's a waste of money, isn't it?<br /><br />So, I've done a little research of some of my other re-purchased films on to Blu-ray (from MGM) and I've noticed that they too, were disappointments to me as a blu-ray transfer.  So, I know now: If it's released by MGM, it won't be any better than the DVD.  MGM just doesn't seem to care WHY we would re-purchase our favorite movies on to Blu-ray.<br /><br />The first Robocop in this box set is the same 2007 release.  They didn't even bother to change the brownish artwork of the disc to match the other two movies bluer artwork.  And of course, there are no extras on any of these discs.<br /><br />With the HDMI cable I had with my older regular DVD player, many of my regular DVD's were greatly improved in picture quality.  So, it's proving to be very few and far between that a Blu-ray reissue of a film is actually going to look any better. Some do.  I have about 75 Blu-Ray discs now, and only about 45 of them look greatly improved.  (When I buy the Blu-Ray, I compare them right away, side by side, Blu-Ray against the DVD, with my two TV's in my den)  I guess some movies can't be helped, while some other movies were great masters from the start so no re-mastering effort would be required.<br /><br />I outta just re-cellophane this Robocop Blu-Ray and give it to somebody for Christmas because my DVD's are just as good anyway. I hope they will apply somewhat of a better effort to improve all the James Bond films onto Blu-Ray.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47\\" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32\\" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47\\" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47\\" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.
0525951652|5.0|It's been years since I read a book about this time period in history. WWII has overshadowed WWI in terms of movies, literature, books written about and stories told over the years. But, Ken Follett has humanized the events of World War I in such a way as to fascinate and enthrall me. With a specific character for each country involved in the War, this novel makes me care about the wartime sacrifices that each country experienced...even Germany. Follett's a master storyteller, and it shows here. While some of the military maneuvers and philosophy may have dragged a bit, the plot doesn't. Characters are well-drawn and sympathetic. Fall of Giants is a massive undertaking, but it is a great success.
B003EYVY0E|2.0|Obviously, a Harry Potter movie cannot be bad, but I was so disappointed in the Ultimate Editions 3 & 4 that I purchased thinking I was buying the extended versions.  I do not use the extra stuff included in these movies. I only buy them for the movie.  I already owned all the movies in blu-ray when thye began releasing them in the Ultimate Edition.  I read somewhere that this edition was the extended version so I ordered the first two.  They were slightly disappointing since they only had the extensions we have been seeing for years on ABCFM-TV but they were, at least, extended.  Thinking I would get more of the same, I ordered the next two releases, Ultimate Editions 3 & 4.  I was shocked to see they did not even have the couple of extra scenes shown on TV.  I feel like I was overcharged for the same movie I already owned.  I don't think I will be buying any more \\"Ultimates\\" unless things change.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Anytime I want to feel better, I watch this movie. I could watch this movie a million times (Really!) and not get bored. When I was in high school, I read Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It was honestly one of the few books I've read in my entire life (and I've read many books in my life) that literally had my heart beat and race at a fast rate. I couldn't put the book down. Jane Austen was one of the best writers of all time. You truly feel, sense, and live through her writing when you flip each page of her books. Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden do an excellent job in this film. The whole cast is great, but it is Keira and Matthew's acting that make this film so beautiful and emotional. If I had a fantasy romance, I would want it to be like this film's version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I've seen all the movie versions of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and this is absolutely my favorite version. I highly recommend this movie to add to your movie library. It's a true classic!
B0013D8LG8|5.0|I've always liked this movie. I know it may not be as \\"historically accurate\\", as far as the legend is concerned, but the movie is entertaining, nonetheless. Feel free to enjoy it for what it is!
B003E6K1VK|5.0|What is there to say really?  If my eyes are closed and my head is nodding then something's right.  It does what it's supposed to do.  It's an external USB DAC when you plug it into your laptop or desktop, an amp for your portable media device when you're on the move.  Love the dual headphone jack.  Helps when comparing two different headphones.  Love the small display.  Gives you just enough info, not too busy.  Very clean.  Love the black aluminum enclosure.  Looks sleek, yet rugged.  I like that.  Comes with handy accessories.  This I dig.  Sound is clean.  Fresh.  Clear.  My ears need to be fed, this provides a healthy serving.  You get all the vitamins and nutrients.  Recommend picking up an LOD if planning to use it with an iPod.  I'm enjoying my music more.  That's all that matters.  I'll enjoy it more when I marry it the E9.  It's coming.  Look out.
0545123275|3.0|So I am like most of you and I do NOT want a review that tells me the story. I want you tell me it was like this book or that, if you are a non reader then my review's will not help you. This book could be a luke warm fourth to the Twilight Series No vampires sorry. I did read it and took my time with it I did not read it in one day like I do most books. Look for my review on the second in this series.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|This original 1931 classic has seen several releases over the past twenty something years. First on VHS with restored footage that had been deleted by censors in 1931 including Dr Frankenstein's ecstatic delivery of the line: \\"In the name of God, now I know what it is to be God!\\" The Legacy Collection from 2004 gave us an improved picture, some related extras, and other original Universal titles that include the name Frankenstein like \\"Bride of..\\" \\"Son of..\\" \\"Ghost of..' and \\"House of...\\".  And now we have the 75th Anniversary version with even better picture and sound as well as many of the extras included on previous versions with the addition of the wonderful feature documentary \\"Universal Horror.\\" While I consider the multi-film Legacy set to be the best deal because of content, this 75th anniversary version is worth buying as well because of the the improved transfer and added documentary. I expected a 75th Anniversary release of 'Bride of Frankenstein\\" since there is a newly restored print avialable but since we are one week from Halloween with no word it doesn't seem likely.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I'm a big Jane Austen fan. Jane Austen is my favorite author of all time. If I had to travel back in time, she would be near the top of my list of people I would like to meet and have a conversation with. I relate to the fact that Jane Austen never got married. I relate to the fact that she had a bond with her sister. I relate to the fact that she loved writing. I could watch any Jane Austen adapted version or themed movie a hundred times and never get tired. The same goes to leaving my TV on Masterpiece Theatre. Maybe I was a British woman in one of my past lives. I just love watching British period films. Anyways, this is my favorite film version of \\"Persuasion\\", and I've seen every single Jane Austen film out there. I always cry each time I see this version. Sally Hawkins is such a great actress and she does an excellent job as Anne Elliot. I really relate to this storyline. I've had boyfriends in my life, and I've always been the good, loyal, honest, trustworthy girlfriend, but I can honestly and genuinely say that I never experienced being deeply and passionately in love with someone. I'm 37, and I've never been in love with a man or told a guy that I was in love with him. To tell a guy that I was in love with him would be a major deal for me. And I've never ever done that because I don't take saying things like that lightly. There was one guy who I think had the potential for me to have those feelings for the first time but I think my current health problems scared him away. I think of Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem in the \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" movie. I think Javier's character says to Julia's character, \\"You don't need a lover, you need a champion.\\" When he said that, I thought to myself, \\"Word!\\" It's going to take a champion of a man to take on me when it comes to love. Anyways, I think Jane Austen books and films fill that void when it comes to the romance department for me. When I watch this film, I really relate to Sally Hawkins' potrayal of Anne. If I was in love with a guy, I would totally be like Anne. This movie has a great cast, but I think this film is excellent because of Sally Hawkins. I found myself feeling my heart racing and being emotional because of Sally Hawkins' portrayal of Anne. And I liked the way that this movie ended. If you want to see an excellent Jane Austen movie, this is it.
078881172X|1.0|We bought this video with a condition rating of NEW!  The video is certainly not new, the case is dirty - the movie is all static, and it skips.  My son (who is autistic) had an extreme melt down because he was supposed to be able to watch PETER PAN, and we couldn't get through the movie!  I will be returning this and will not purchase from this seller again.  Shame on the seller for the misleading condition!!!
0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett  creates strong, independent and believable female characters better than any male writer I've ever read.  The story grabs you right from the first page.  1000 pages is nothing when reading one of Follett's epic tales.  I simply loved this book and can't wait for the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />Oh maybe there are a few chance encounters that seem far fetched to \\"some\\" reader/reviewers but hell the main characters are \\"fictitious\\".  If you prefer complete reality read a  non-fiction history book.  As for the rest of us who read to escape reality and want to journey into another time or place this is the book for you.  Quickly, you'll find yourself identifying with certain characters and wishing you did not know the outcome of the \\"real\\" history.<br /><br />Personally, this is one of my all time favorites now because not only did I love the story....I actually learned more about World War I than what was taught in high school.  History and war stories in general bored me to tears with battles, dates and military/political details.  But somehow all of the stuff learned in school actually made sense after reading \\"Fall of Giants\\".  Amazing!  Who'd ever thought I'd love a good war story?????<br /><br />$19.99 for e-version to me was worth every penny not to have to lug around a 1000 page hard cover.  My Sony reader is with me everyday and I polished this book off in 10 days.<br /><br />Please keep giving us the new releases via e-version.
0739337270|5.0|I finished reading The Book Thief a couple weeks ago, and am still haunted daily by passages and scenes from this story. It is a masterpiece of wordplay, and prose so elegantly arranged it is nearly poetic.    The story brings the reader very intimately into the lives of people living in Germany during WWII, most especially the life of a small impoverished girl, the likes of whom is unimportant to historians, undramatic to Hollywood, but one of a type who lived through the nightmare and survived it.    It is narrated by Death, who slows down in this very busy time for him to wonder at the small scrappy girl who's fondest desire was to learn to read and write. She tries in her innocent way to understand her world to the best of her ability, to make sense of the Nazi propaganda she is subjected to, and yet still find pleasure in her world, her friends, her family, and what's in the basement.    Much thanks to the author for this unique and wonderful perspective. I love these characters, and the story moved my soul in such a way that few other books ever have.
B001R0XNSI|4.0|While this isn't the best marker I've ever used, it's useful for other reasons. If you ever have a need for something small and sturdy, this is it. The plastic is unbreakable, unbendable and light. It's like holding a titanium rod in your hands.    The cap screws on with many small threads, making a very sturdy package indeed - no weak point here!
0312600844|5.0|Overall, I thought this novel was fabulous.  The character development is superb, with plenty of back story to really know where the main characters are coming from, and why they make the choices they do.  And even though the novel is written in the third person, each chapter focuses on an individual character, resulting in an overall effect of the novel alternating in different first persons, which really allows the reader to get into each character.  There's an excellent balance of humor, drama, surprises, and suspense.<br /><br />It took me many pages to settle into the author's style of having one scene flow into another, making each chapter seem endless, yet once I did, I became thoroughly absorbed.  It was a fine read.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|At first I thought, wow another remake??? but a friend said , you have to see this show, so I did... Finally a scifi show that doesn't rely on expensive special effects, techno doublespeek, and fancy costumes. The characters have been very well developed. The story, while fanciful, deals with human issues, and touches on today's issues without being overly political. I think this is one of the best series ever. I rarely ever make it a point to watch TV, and this has been the exception.
B002RWKSII|5.0|It's amazing that one man can make such a big difference in music. You can say that about George Gershwin and about Brian Wilson. While Gershwin succesfully introduced jazz in classical music, Brian Wilson redefined rock with stunning close harmony. Later Wilson brought more complexity into his work, with uncompared masterpieces Pet Sounds and Smile. On his 2008 album That Lucky Old Sun he refers in some songs to his past, the good times and the lesser good.    And now, on Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin he even goes further back. That is, he brings music from his (pre-)childhood into modern time, the music is cheerfull with a twist of the Beach Boys sounds here and there. The most striking is the blend of Farmer's Daughter (1963) with I've Got Rhythm (1930).     Brian Wilson is not only a musicman. He is a Musicteller, a teacher, celebrating the joy of life.
0525951652|4.0|I am just now reading Fall of Giants. I am three quarters of the way thru it. It is a very long book. It goes into quite a bit of detail of the war and the upper classes of the period. Its amazing to me how many people of that era could pull themselves out of such grinding poverty of the time. It says a lot about their fortitude.  In some parts of the book it does get a little bit wordy in details and in other parts not enought. It does leave loose ends about how some of the characters got out of their situations.  Thanks Linda
B003XRZZFM|5.0|Wow is all I can say. This is their best album besides \\"Death Cult Armageddon\\".I don't care if this is not \\"true\\" black metal produced in a garage with spiders or not, it's still good music period. This album, along with Septic Flesh's \\"Communion\\", are the two best symphonic black metal albums in existence. Dimmu Borgir deserve every accolade written about them. This band proves that even diversity cannot stop creativity. I think they are a great representation of black metal and what can be done within that genre. This is rock and roll mixed with Wagner. Majestic metal! Bombastic black metal! Edit-I have listened to this album in the last two weeks and I am sorry, but this is a freaking masterpiece of it's genre.
B000SEHN3K|3.0|I bought this book to be able to read the stories to my daughter. I assumed the stories would be like other Curious George books I've read. However, the first story made my daughter cry because the man with the yellow hat throws George in a bag and takes the scared little monkey out of his homeland. Then they give him a pipe to smoke and everything is better. It was just shocking because it is so different than the other stories I've read. I wish I had previewed the story before I read it to her.<br /><br />I also didn't like that characters, including George, smoked. I realize this story was written in the 1940s, but I wasn't expecting this because the newer Curious George stories I've read to her were like that. I guess I didn't remember that from when I was a child. While I wish the characters didn't smoke in the stories, I use that to discuss the topic of smoking and the fact that people didn't use to know better and that's why so many people became addicted.<br /><br />Just to clarify, it's only the first story that my daughter didn't like. She loves the other ones and we read them all the time. She especially loves the 2nd story (Curious George Takes a Job)
B0000Z0HMQ|1.0|The fine print stated (after) I bought it, was that this DVD would'nt play on American DVR players...they were right. Bad choice. I won't do that again.   And since I opened it, I could'nt return it...
B003V6L94Q|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that i loved The Foundation. I think ZBB has the potential to be Alabama big. There were several factors, in my opinion, that made TF so great:     - outstanding lead vocals. Another reviewer mentioned james taylor (in a negative connatation). I lean this way too, but i find it to be a great compliment. Both artists are incredible musicians and very soulful performers.   - tight instrumentals. anyone who has heard ZBB, particularly live, will attest to this. its refreshing to have a band thats actually a band, if you will.  - FIDDLE!  If you're gonna play in texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band :) Seriously though, they use it well, outside of the obvious solo runs, its never overpowering or out of place. it really sings        All of this adds up to my main selling point of TF, its raw emotion. The vocals, fiddle accompaniment, and lyrics make you really feel the music. This is pretty intangible, but whether its the carefree \\"Toes\\", the pain of \\"Highway 20 ride\\" or toe tapping \\"Chicken Friend\\", TF always makes you feel...something.        Okay, so all that said, \\"You get what you give\\" does not leave me with this same emotional connection. Its doesn't have that REALness to it.I've tried hard to get there, but something is just missing. I'm not saying it isn't worth a listen. On all accounts, its a decent album, and better than most of the tripe being put out these days. It just isn't a great album. It feels a bit, i don't know, show-offy to me. The harmonies (which many have praised) seem out of place alot of the time. Instrumental portions too, just seem to get in the way of the message of songs sometimes. I dont know, these elements should punctuate a story, instead, in my opinion, they detract from one.         While there will undoubtedly be a couple of number ones to come off of this album, and it will be a commercial success, i really hope that the band finds that little extra heart they put into The Foundation sometimesoon.  If they can find it again and hold on to it, they will be around a very very long time.  If you disagree with me, feel free to let me know. this is all my personal opinion and i dont claim to be an expert by any means.

067144901X|5.0|Such a fun book...my 17 month old granddaughter calls it la la and it's her first choice every time.
0439023513|2.0|I enjoyed Hunger Games a lot, and Catching Fire as well (though I thought that Catching Fire had some flaws).  These flaws became all the more apparent in Mockingjay, where the fast pace and any character development was quickly derailed.  The main problems can be summed up thusly:    1) Limitations of the point of view.  In Hunger Games, Katniss's first person POV helped keep up the suspense.  You only knew what she knew in the arena, and you read to find out what was going on.  When were the Careers going to find her and try to kill her?  What were Peeta's motivations?  Etc, etc.  This also worked in Catching Fire.  However, much of Mockingjay is spent with people explaining what happened off-screen to Katniss.  She gets told things second hand a lot.  This really bothered me.  I wanted to see the action take place, not be told about it.  What little action there is in the beginning is the awkward, staged propaganda pieces which make little sense.  Which brings me to the next point.    2) The action in the back third of the book was poorly written.  I think it was rushed.  At no point in Hunger Games did I have trouble understanding what was going on.  I had to reread parts several times to understand what had happened, particularly Finnick's and Prim's deaths.  The last part was basically one big swirl of confusion, choppily written and edited.  What's more, the constant need to tie everything back to the Hunger Games got old really fast with the \\"pods are like being back at the Games!\\" thing.  Uhhh no.      3) Gale's rather odious character derailment.  I was indifferent to who Katniss ended up declaring her love for, but all the ploys that Collins used to get Gale out of the picture just felt cheap to me.  Him possibly having a part in the bomb that killed her sister?  Katniss needed that to realize that he wasn't right for her?  That's cheap.  She should have had to struggle to reach that conclusion on her own, rather than making Gale not only uncomfortably, if indirectly, responsible for Prim's death on top of having Gale be a jerk to Katniss through most of the book.  Collins set up a perfect plot for Katniss to realize she loved Peeta.  Taking his love away from her should have really finally opened up her eyes to what she felt, and had her try to earn him, but this is relatively glossed over.      4) Collins seems to have forgotten that the readers see the world through Katniss's eyes.  And hollow, inactive, depressed, and drugged up eyes are not really the best eyes to see the world through.  A different writer might have been able to make this work, but keeping Katniss's depression and lethargy compelling was just outside the scope of her gifts.  She's much better at other things that she didn't capitalize on.  Katniss is horribly traumatized -- as she should be -- but wandering, self-centered thoughts about how traumatized she is don't make for very interesting reading in Collins's hands.  After a while, I was really starting to hate Katniss, and how she seemed unwilling to sacrifice anything for the rebellion.  Everything seemed to come back to her.  Oh, Haymitch manipulated me in the arena!  How terrible!  It's not like he wasn't trying to do something good for the world at large by doing so!  These thoughts, all of which we're privy to, got wearing fast.      I think Collins needed more time to write this book.  The ending in particular felt extremely rushed.  In the end, it wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it was so far from living up to the promise of the first two installments that I just hated it.
0446569895|5.0|I've been a metal fan for years - since the early/mid 80s.  And I've been a fan of Ozzy since then.  This year I was fortunate enough to see him live during the Ozzfest at Tinley Park.  I wasn't let down!  Ozzy is an entertainer like no other in the metal scene.  He's lasted a long time and there's a reason why: he's talented and knows how to give the fans what they want.  My only regret is not seeing him sooner!<br /><br />But all that aside, I first saw this book during that show.  Later on, I decided to pick up a copy and read it.  Like his live show, I was totally entertained.  I laughed so many times!  And at other times, I became engrossed in his life's story.  The book is honest, contains a lot of candor about his personal life, extensive details about his career, including the tragedy that took the life of Randy Rhoads, as well as a lot of humor.  I think Ozzy's critics fail to see him for who he is.  He's utterly unpretentious.  His book details a guy with a great deal of humor, one who overcame an immense deal of obstacles (dyslexia, working class background, etc.), both personal (some self-made) and situational, to get to where he is now.  Ozzy's book is truly a journey, and he takes us along with him, through it all.  It's quite the read, and anyone, anyone at all interested in his music and his life will no doubt enjoy it.  I highly recommend it!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I decided to rent this series for my brothers birthday. A avid collector of war memorabilia he had served in the military but had missed any active duty in a warzone.  We always would watch war movies on his birthday, what I did not expect is that the whole family, including my 17 year old niece would sit glued to the TV for the whole night/morning.  Yes, I said morning.  We finished at 2 am, including the short interview with the actual marines.    This series highlights the lack of support our military receives from those of us left back here at home.  These people are risking their lives for something they believe in, our way of life, yet they cannot receive basic foundational supplies and logistics? Unbelievable.  The recorded out takes during the credit rolls on the last disk are heart breaking but oh so true.  It is a shame that gossip about which celebrity screwed who is more Newsworthy that what our military deal with on a daily basis.
0143038583|3.0|The greatest strength of Omnivore's Dilemma is its focus on Joel Salatin and Polyface Farms. Pollan's comparison of Salatin's ingenious farming methods based on natural animal grazing patterns against those of industrial food chain, inclusive of stationary feed troughs, CAFOs, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, etc, is interesting and effective. The chapters \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" and \\"The Processing Plant: The Making of Complex Foods\\" are good, and the entire first section entitled \\"Industrial / Corn\\" is worth reading.    One of the book's principal weaknesses is its structure.  Ostensibly organized as \\"Natural History of Four Meals,\\" the book has only three sections. While Pollan does a good job of examining the natural history of a fast food meal in section one: Industrial / Corn, he has to combine the latter three meals (grass-produced, locally grown, and personally produced or hunted) into the remaining two sections: Pastoral / Grass and Personal / Forest. Neither the writing nor the logic of the sections is well served, and the unbalanced structure gives way to an uneven and meandering narrative.    In the latter two sections, Pollan shies away from discussing historical elements of his subject and relies heavily on his own experience to advance his argument. The result is the narrative takes on the tone of an extended personal essay.  The problem is the parts of the book that are interesting are the historical/biological/chemical discussions of the meals (and their effects on our food chain), and NOT what Pollan is feeling, thinking, etc. during the times when he is exploring them.      Untethered by the objective and historical elements of his subject, Pollan's writing deteriorates. In his personal narrative, he comes across as indecisive, mawkish, clumsy and pretentious--worse, occasionally he slips into shallow self-consciousness.  Example:    \\"Wait a minute.  Did I really write that last paragraph?  Without irony?  That's embarrassing.  I'm actually writing about the hunter's `instinct,' suggesting that the hunt represents some sort of primordial union between two kinds of animals, one of which is me?  This seems a bit much.  I recognize this prose:  hunter porn.  And whenever I've read it in the past, in Ortega y Gasset and Hemingway and all those hard-bitten, big-bearded American wilderness writers who still pine for the Pleistocene, it never failed to roll my eyes\\" (336).    That this quote reveals more about Pollan than Hemingway is axiomatic; Pollan's problem with \\"wilderness writers\\" is interesting insofar as it is related to his problem with another somewhat larger demographic:  Believers.  Examples:    \\"Joel began the meal by closing his eyes and saying a rambling and strikingly non-generic version of grace, offering a fairly detailed summary of the day's doings to a Lord who, to judge by Joel's tone of easy familiarity, was present and keenly interested\\" (203).    \\"What had been cow manure and woodchips just a few weeks before now smelled as sweet and warm as the forest floor in summertime, a miracle of transubstantiation\\" (219).    \\"I once encouraged a food writer from a big city newspaper to pay a visit to Polyface. The day after she got back she telephoned me, all in a lather about the alien beings she had to spend a day with in Swoope: You never told me he had a Jesus fish on his front door!\\" (246).    \\"For we would no longer need reminding that however we choose to feed ourselves, we eat by the grace of nature, not industry, and what we're eating is never anything more or less than the body of this world\\" (411).    What is striking about Pollan's apparent flippancy toward religion (he is a proud atheist) is that it lacks awareness: Pollan quotes frequently and favorably from Wendell Berry, and makes Joel Salatin the centerpiece of his book - and yet he seems unconcerned with how each man's religious beliefs have influenced their views of agriculture.  Rather, he seems only interested in them insofar as they produce a quote that supports his views.    Pollan's religious insecurity is manifest is his awkward groping for a fitting phrase to describe the reverence he feels for his \\"perfect meal\\" (entirely hunted or gathered). He eventually settles on the phrase, \\"Omnivore's Thanksgiving,\\" and his self-righteous satisfaction with the term makes clear that he is unaware that \\"thanksgiving\\" has a definitively Christian origin.    Pollan's stance on religion is relevant because it was a frequent, visible and unnecessary digression in a book with a timely and perfectly intriguing subject.      Omnivore's Dilemma would have been a stronger work if Pollan had revealed less about himself and more about his subject matter.
0142428272|5.0|Starts off by catching your interest immediately. YOU care about the characters from the very beginning. Reminded me very much of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and World without End. Enjoyed it very much. You will too, if you like Follett's other historicals. Tish
1582701709|5.0|By learning the Secret you will know how to have, be or do anything you have wanted to do. You will learn who you really are. The book is \\"The Secret\\", the author is Rhonda Byrne. \\"In the book, you'll learn how to use The Secret in every aspect of your life-money, health, relationships, happiness, and in every interaction you have in the world.\\" Be reading this book it makes you really start to think of how you live your life. What are your thoughts, your acts to others. It is a very uplifting book. When you apply the secret to every part of your life you will start seeing the change happen.       Byrne explained how successful people got their success. She interviewed a lot of successful doctors,  teachers, and looking into very well know people . She started tracing the secret back through history to find that people had discovered the secret back then. They were the greatest people in history like Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, Hugo, Beethoven, Lincoln, Emerson, Edison, and Einstein. These are very smart and well know people. So if they knew the secret back then, then why aren't more people using today? Why doesn't everyone know about the secret.
030726999X|4.0|Absolutely the most riveting mystery novels I have ever read.The fact that he was a stickler for naming all the streets and areas made reading a little difficult at first.

0439023491|5.0|I bought this series for my \\"tween\\" daughter and ended up loving it as well.  A strong female character drives this thought provoking adventure.  While it contains some violence it seemed justified.  The story is intense and the messages about war, revolution, government and even the media stay with the reader long after the final page.  I would recommend this triology to any reader over age ten.

B003Q6D25K|4.0|PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was flat-out one of the scarier movies of recent years.   The simple story, told with the low-budget device of all the events being captured on a home camcorder, was remarkably effective and the film gave a sensation of reality and was extremely creepy.  Most \\"scary\\" movies just go for giving you a jump-in-your-seat moment...if t hey can momentarily make your heart beat faster, that's success enough.  PARANORMAL actually made me feel a little bit anxious, even after the film was over.    Inevitably, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 cannot be so successful, because it used many of the same conventions as the first.  The shock of newness has worn off.  That being said, it is a far, far better sequel than anyone had the right to hope for.      We meet a family in Southern California on the day the couple comes back from the hospital with their new baby, Hunter.  Dad is a nearing middle-aged man with a teenage daughter, Ali, from a previous marriage.  His wife is considerably younger...but not to the point of being ridiculous.  They have a nice, older housekeeper and a German Shepherd.  They are a pretty happy group...the teen daughter is actually a nice, intelligent, helpful young lady.  There's no marital strife.  Life is good.    One day, they experience a break-in, so Dad has a security system installed, with camera's focused on several spots of the house at once.  This device allows for several angles to be captured at one time...because their domestic bliss is soon interrupted by strange events.  This is how PA2 is a step forward from PA.  The first film relied exclusively on footage captured on one camcorder.  Now we have about 6 different shots of the house, along with camcorder footage.  It's a nifty (if obvious) device...but it's pretty important.  We can now watch mysterious things happening in more than one location at a time.  It becomes pretty clear early on that whatever paranormal activity is going on in this household is directed primarily at young Hunter.      I do not want to give away any more plot, because there are actually some surprises in store.  And the first movie does have an unexpected connection to the sequel...a very clever and satisfying one, in my opinion.  In fact, I somewhat regret not watching the first one again prior to seeing the sequel.    The movie retains, for the most part, the low-budget feel.  We're supposedly watching \\"found\\" footage again.  However, because several cameras were used, obviously significantly more editing was needed...therefore the movie feels just a little less \\"found\\" than before.  And the acting, frankly, is just a bit slicker than the first time.  This all results in a very low-budget movie that still feels ever so slightly glossy.  Probably not enough to detract from the overall experience...but I certainly noticed.    The film, in my opinion, offers more creepiness and fewer genuine frights than the first.  It plays off our sense of dread very well.  For nearly 90 minutes, you sit there worried about what will happen next.  This doesn't really happen in horror films very often, and it is an uncomfortable yet pleasurable experience.      I was very skeptical that PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2 would be anything more than a cheap rip-off of the first...a pure cash grab.  I'm very happy to report that this is actually a highly-satisfying, unexpectedly clever sequel that tries, first and foremost, to creep you out.  If you liked or loved the first film, you'll enjoy this one as well.  If, for some reason, you disliked the first...stay away and let the rest of us enjoy!

0698116496|5.0|Good Night, Gorilla is one of those books that I'd always see in the book store, but never read or even picked up for some reason. I always wanted to, but some other book would catch my eye, or my daughter would run up with some of her picks. Yesterday we finally gave it a shot, and she loved it. While I was reading it to her, I could tell that she was a little too old for it (she's almost 4), since this is more of a picture book than anything, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still cute.    The story's an easy one to tell: a gorilla nabs the keys from the zoo keeper one night, then goes around freeing all the other animals. Giraffes, elephants, lions, etc. One by one, they march back to the zoo keeper's home, and sneak into his bedroom. The gorilla goes into the zookeeper's bed, but then him and his wife wake up, and notice the gorilla in their bed, and all the other animals in their room, and take them back to the zoo.    There isn't much to read here- mostly animal names and \\"good night\\" a few times. But I'm not one of those parents that requires a story in order for the book to be enjoyable for their kids- just look at Where the Wild Things Are, one of my favorites that has a couple of pages with no text at all, just gorgeous illustrations to enjoy. That's the case here with Good Night, Gorilla, though the drawings are more comical. I -loved- the one where the gorilla had this big sly grin on his face when the zoo keeper's wife realized there was a gorilla next to her in the bed.     I think kids under the age of 4, and definitely under 3 will get the most out of this. Little to read, lots of nice illustrations. 'not much of a book to read for bed time, but there's a good amount to point out on the pages while you're going through it. It's cute, plain and simple.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|After reading all the previous reviews of this Remastered film, i was a little worried as so many have been quite damming.<br /><br />I first saw this Movie in 1974 at the Trak Cinema in South Yarra Melbourne Australia, and yes it was in Glorious Quadrophonic-as an 11 y/o it left a big impression on me. From that day till now i have always gauged Rolling Stones performances against this film.<br /><br /> They have never got close again. It is why i have trouble listening to the Ronnie Wood Recordings. Mick Taylor was/is just so good, it is he who makes the Band play beyond themselves, the same thing happened in '73 in Europe, Taylor made keith really work so hard<br /><br />This Film is pure Rock n Roll, played so well.<br /><br />So when i read so many average reviews i was very concerned.<br /><br /> Now i will say, I have only watched and heard this in 2 Channel Digital Stereo. I don't have surround Sound yet.<br /><br />So I cranked the volumeup Hard, and switched on the \\"Loudness\\" Button of my old but still Trusty Sansui Amp. And this old Girl came to life...WOW i was stoked.<br /><br /> This took me straight back 36 years.  Even the look of the film is the same as it was. It was shot Dark, so i am Happy it still is. The loudness just gave Charlie & Bill the pump they needed. So i am really happy with this movie, the 5.1 i cannot comment on, but maybe the Audio had deteriorated over the past few decades.<br /><br />I have my doubts that the original stock prints were well looked after,(Did Allen Klein own this?) so maybe the Audio is not compatible for a 5.1 mix. But to have that awesome stereo track is good enough for me<br /><br />This is a Fantastic Concert Film, that's what it is. The Rolling Stones at the start of that whole 1972-73  USA-Australia-Europe tour, that so many of us have heard and loved on Bootleg recordings.<br /><br />i will be watching this film Many times, and it will probably accompany me in my coffin!!<br />Waited so long for this.<br />************************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />November 1st. 2010<br /><br />I Have just seen this movie on the BIG screen at the Cinema..The way it was always meant to be seen. Video & DVD players did not exist in 1974.<br />This film was shot as a Cinema experience.<br /><br />So just remember that when watching...It is a old Grainy Film that has been salvaged (thankfully)<br /><br />The Soundtrack in the Cinema was incredible. The Stereo Track in my lounge room was great once i had played with it, and set it up.<br /><br />Think of this DVD like an older Car, it needs a little bit of love and attention. Set the Amplifier to it, think of the room you are watching it in.<br /><br />It is a Concert movie mixed for cinema...Spend half an hour setting up your room to compliment the sound...it is well worth it.<br /><br />When all of us are dead and gone, this movie will be what people will have of the Rolling Stones. This is the BEST film ever made about Rock Music.<br />The Stones are still together because this performance was achieved, & we have always hoped that they could emulate it again.<br /><br />They won't. But at least this old girl is back in circulation, and it still sounds Awesome and full of Raw Power.********************************************************************************  November 1st. 2010    I Have just seen this movie on the BIG screen at the Cinema..The way it was always meant to be seen.

B000000WCV|1.0|You listen to this album and Discovery back to back and this album becomes firewood. Much more catchy tracks on Discovery. Discovery just took this album and shot it multiple times. I'd rather pour gasoline on my record player and watch it set on fire than listen to some tracks on this album. All the good tracks on this album are killed by the dumb ones! Just go here: http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B000059MEK    Thank you and DO NOT buy this album. As much as I love Daft Punk, all this is good is for a scratcher at the club or something else when you ran out of records and the people in the club are forming an angry mob around you. Thank you.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|A hero with amenesia? Camp Half-Blood without Percy? It's hard to belive, but it's true. Once again, Rick Riordan pulls off a stunning read filled with familliar and strange names. Thalia has a brother? Gaia's awakening? You have to see it to believe it!!!!!
0307454541|3.0|Underwhelmed by its writing and overwhelmed by its sadomasochistic content.  This book should come with a warning similar to the warning printed on a pack of cigarettes.  WARNING:<br />Reading this book can cause you to relive traumatic events and their attendant symptoms, including but not limited to: elevated heart rate, exaggerated startle response, virtual paralysis of speech and movement,etc.
B00005GA0L|5.0|You are not likely to be looking at this review unless you are wondering about the audio quality.  The performance is legendary and does not need further comment from me.  I will address the sound quality.  In a word - the BEST!  As of 2010 at least, I don't know of a better digital transfer.    I will leave vinyl evaluations elsewhere.  If you have s stereo system that takes advantage of SACD sound quality, you will not be disappointed.  This is a desert island recording that now has desert island digital sound.  Enough said!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Mr. Cadwell got it right. success cannot be attributed to one thing but a collection of who we are, what we know, who we know, where we are, when we are at. Great read.
B003YOZNBK|5.0|I've never read the comix, and can only judge the movie on it's own. Ignoring all the fashionable \\"Megan Fox is So hot... but won't do me\\" or \\"Can't act\\" hate going on... she's no better or worse then a million Hollywood chicks... The movie is actually a fun ride. Sure they don't explain Jonah's powers much, but that's much cooler then some techno-babel answer or something silly like midi-chlorians in the recent Star Wars films. Jonah Hex is an interesting character and I'd like to see more of him.
B000UR9QHQ|2.0|This isn't the first time I have seen Halloween, but I figured I would check out the Blu Ray, since I haven't seen the movie in atleast 10 years.  Upon watching, after the initial kill, of his sister, Michael Myers waits about 30 to 40 minutes in the movie before he kills anyone else.  It is pretty much just him watching through windows, popping out behind bushes, etc.<br /><br />The movie lacks the gore that other films in that same time error had.  Movies such as Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre trump this ten times over. The kill scenes were VERY VERY VERY weak.  The Special FX are horrible, and please don't jump on my case and say, it was a late 70's movie.  They could have done much better!  Compare the death scenes in this movie to other death scenes, from movies in the late 70's and early 80's and you will see that this movie lacks!<br /><br />The movie is considered a classic by most, but to me...It's a pile of crap.  If you disagree, then i'll be getting rid of my copy here on amazon.
B002BEXFW8|4.0|Update:<br />I have added an update to my review as I have finally found the definitive version of this Classic Purple album. That's the good news.  The bad news is that it is hard to get.  What is it?  The original UK vinyl pressing on Harvest.  I have (or had) the Audio Fidelity cd (runner up and best on cd so far), a Canadian pressing (not green label) and a recent Friday Music reissue that had to be returned due to a bad pressing of side 2.  Well, nothing compares to this original UK vinyl LP.  I had given up on this ever sounding very good, despite the fantastic material.  Make no mistake - Deep Purple were never as well recorded as say Supertramp but Machine Head was a decent recording and sounds terrific on SACD.  DP were always about the hard driving songs for me.  Add this one to one of the most pleasant surprises sonically in my entire collection.  The music has always been first rate and now the sound is too.  They never rocked harder than this and and now you can hear it much more clearly!<br /><br />Original review:<br />This Deep Purple album has always been a favorite of mine.  It was my first DP acquisition and while I love Machine Head, this has a freshness and power that the band was never able to capture again.  This album really rocks hard, the hardest of any DP before or after.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was not as well recorded as Machine Head was so it will never sound as good.  This Audio Fidelity release does upgrade the sound for systems able to take advantage of its sonic subtleties.  Not that much is subtle about In Rock :-)<br /><br />Steve Hoffman's mastering does bring a level of nuance that I have not heard before.  There is more of a soundstage presentation here rather than just raw and loud as found in the Anniversary edition remasters.  That becomes a preference of course so if you want raw and loud, you know where to find it.<br /><br />The booklet contains lyrics only and there are no bonus tracks. As another reviewer mentioned, the version of Speed King is the extended one with the 'shred' intro.  Doesn't bother me and my guess is that as Hoffman likes to go to original recordings, that would be part of it.  In conclusion then, a moderate, not major upgrade in sound.<br /><br />Machine Head is also available in this Audio Fidelity series but the best sound for it is the hard to find SACD version (in my opinion).
B002QVOQ0Q|5.0|I also learned of Riverside  a few years back and started with \\"Second Life Syndrome\\" which I enjoy. I would say their first three releases are 4-star or \\"very good\\". ADHD, however, is definitely 5-star. I love their new direction. It still has traces of their sound from their previous releases, but they definitely stepped up the intensity. A heavier album, but in such a good way. Every song is excellent along with the production. I actually didn't purchase this one until a year after it's release since I was holding out for the special edition to drop in price. I finally caved and paid the high price on Amazon, but now realize I lost a year of enjoyment of the music. The DVD is OK, I probably could of stuck with the standard edition since I have their \\"Reality Dream\\" DVD which is great. I hope Riverside continues in this direction, and I will definitely buy their next release immediately.
1453624910|5.0|I may be a bit biased, with the Nightrunner series being my favorite books, possibly of all time. It's great to see some spots filled in, and a look into some of the characters' backgrounds. Thanks, Lynn, for yet more wonderful stories from your world!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|When I first started reading World War Z, it took a few chapters for me to get into the writing. This is not a typical novel with characters you're rooting for. There is no storyline, no heroes.        It's written by a \\"reporter\\" who went out and interviewed various people, in various countries, about their personal experience in this war. Each story is unique to whomever's being interviewed. The only thing they have in common, is the zombie war.    As I was reading, I started to actually believe it happened,that a zombie epidemic took over the world. It was unreal how this book dragged me in. The stories are first hand accounts of how they survived the epidemic. Where they were, what they did, how they got out, and how they fought. Each one reads like a short auto-biography.     I was very impressed with the way it flowed, and taken by complete surpise at how much I enjoyed it, as I'm not a fan of the Zombie genre.
B002BEXG86|5.0|I have to admit that I couldn't appreciate the sound quality of this release until I upgraded my sound system. In fact, I didn't understand what all the fuss about Steve Hoffman's work was.    Honestly, I was missing the point - now I have to admit that I do hear it.    Most people reading this will be familiar with the songs so this review is mainly about the sound.    Spacious and a pleasing soundstage were not qualities I would have associated with Alice Cooper until hearing this. Well, no longer.  Right from the opening charge of \\"Under My Wheels\\" the sound is terrific and surprisingly good for, well, Alice Cooper.    Bob Ezrin certainly knew what he was doing and went on to prove it for many years, perhaps culminating in Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\".  He got his start with Alice and the boys and you can hear it on this very fine Audio Fidelity release.    After all, where else can you hear something like \\"Halo of Flies\\" and be enthralled by the fine sound as well as its very 'dated' performance?  Not that there is anything wrong with that!     The best of the past with the best of the present.  Highly recommended!
0765328321|5.0|Being a moderate fan of the Halo series I was interested when I heard about the Halo book series. Seeing that the price was lowered to a fairly reasonable price (in my opinion), I purchased it. The day I got the book was on a Friday afternoon and once I started reading it I could not get myself to put it down. The style and voice in the book is fascinating and I ended up reading through entire nights and finishing by the end of the weekend, it was that addicting. I highly recommend this book if you're a Halo fan or are interested in the series. Definitely ready to pick up the next book in the series soon!
0811876373|5.0|I just received the book from Amazon and I love it! It's super cute and I like how the book is hardcover with the spiral spine. There are plenty of pictures and step-by-step instructions and lots of ideas and tips on what to make.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I'm so gald that I ordered this material. It is a wonderful film and by far will be a great addition to my collection.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|I love Soundtracks as when well done, they feature an eclectic selection, as well as introduce one to acts one may otherwise have missed. \\"Vampire Diaries\\" comprises songs that have featured in the TV series of the same name. I haven't watched it but still find this hugely enjoyable.<br /><br />A few of my favourite artists are here; Placebo turn in a creepier slowed down piano-sprinkled cover of Kate Bush's \\"Running Up That Hill\\", Bat For Lashes sings the haunting \\"Sleep Alone (909s In The Darktimes Mix)\\" (it appeared on her \\"Two Suns\\" CD in a more subtle version), Goldfrapp sing the upbeat synth Pop \\"We Radiate\\", Plumb sing the lush piano ballad \\"Cut\\", Smashing Pumpkins sing the electro Rock \\"The Fellowship\\",  and Gorillaz sing \\"On Melancholy Hill (Feed Me Remix)\\" (a clubby version of a song that appeared on their \\"Plastic Beach\\" CD).<br /><br />Other standouts are \\"Stefan's Theme\\", a delicate instrumental by Michael Suby, the groovy rocker \\"Currency Of Love\\" by Silversun Pickups, the absolutely enchanting \\"Hammock\\" by Howls (my favourite), Sky Ferreira on the jittery electropop \\"Obsession\\", the swirling ballad \\"Head Over Heels\\" by Digital Daggers, and the piano ballad \\"Down\\" by Jason Walker\\".<br /><br />This is one collection with a bite (pardon the pun).
B003M5AXN4|5.0|I love Speed Racer cartoons as a boy, especially the Mach 5. The movie brought back so much memories, although the fancy tracks are too futuristic (read: too unrealistic). But the actions are super, especially showcasing some spectacular maneuvers that just make a driving enthusiast speechless!<br /><br />My young boys love this movie too and just can't get enough of it. The full HD is a must for this kind of movie and make sure your flat panel has fast refresh. My only complain is my Plasma showed the color too rich. But that's not just the colorful race tracks; it's the nature of the plasma. I think LCD/LED flat panels may look better with this film.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|When my husband suggested we watch Secretariat tonight, I was a bit hesitant since I had loved [[ASIN:B00005JMCN Seabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)]] and wondered if this was just going to be more of the same. I am glad I was proved wrong, as both stories, though centering on amazing horses, are also quite different.<br /><br />Secretariat is the story of an amazing horse and its even more amazing owner. Housewife and mother of four Penny Chenery (Diane Lane in a spirited performance, one of her career's best), returns home to attend her mother's funeral and finds her ailing father (Scott Glenn) in really bad shape. She decides to stay on and help stabilize her father's horse business, Meadow Stables, and when she finds out the trainer is committing fraud, she promptly fires him. Penny's husband Jack (Dylan Walsh) is not too thrilled that his wife is taking on this responsibility, and neither is Penny's brother Hollis (Dylan Baker) a Harvard professor of economics who thinks it makes more financial sense to sell the business.<br /><br />Penny decides that she will manage the horse farm, commuting between Virginia and her home back in Denver. Well, to cut a long story short, Penny Chevery not only manages to do that, she also manages, with the aid of horse trainer Lucien Laurin (the always entertaining John Malkovich), jockey Ronnie Turcotte (Otto Thorwath), groom Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis), and of course loyal secretary Miss Ham (Margo Martindale) to create racing history by producing a champion of champions, Secretariat or Big Red as he was fondly called - a horse so amazing that his record in the Triple Crown back in 1973 has yet to be bested.<br /><br />This movie is not just a horse movie - it is a perfect confluence of all that makes a hit movie, i.e. consummate storytelling, an incredible ensemble cast led by Diane Lane, flawless cinematography (the horse races were so well choreographed and edited that I felt like I was there during each race, cheering Secretariat on), and a well-written script. This is as much a movie about the horse, Secretariat, as it is a story about the amazing woman whose relentless determination gave the world this champion. Penny Chenery broke out from the typical housewife mold, and proved to the men in the horse business that she was someone to contend with, and earned respect and admiration in the process.<br /><br />Note to parents considering this movie for young children: We took our five-and-a-half year old daughter (who happens to love horses) to see this movie, and there's nothing that we found offensive. The language is clean, there are no scenes of a sexual nature, and it is just a great family-friendly drama. In this day and age of insipid, violence-saturated movies, Secretariat is a welcome respite that will inspire and entertain.ten script.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|This HDMI cable works great. There is absolutely no reason to spend money for an expensive HDMI cable. I use mine to connect my computer to my HDTV and the picture quality is superb.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|T2 blu-ray definitely has visible better quality than the DVD. The sound comes through a bit better as well. Good deal when it's under $13 and no-brainer to add if you are the fan of Terminator series and look to upgrade your blu-ray collection.
B001AQO400|5.0|I've seen Bill Murray's older work (let's face it, Caddyshack is quintessential Bill Murray) and was curious to check him out in a more mature, serious role.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" has since become one of my most favorite movies by Murray and in general.  People looking for some kind of \\"Shopgirl\\"-esque May-November relationship between the two main characters will be sorely disappointed; this movie is more about the lost art of developing truly platonic relationships with people of different gender and maybe more uncomfortably, age.  Bill Murray plays a fading middle-aged star who wants nothing more than a friend and unlike Steve Martin's exceptionally self-centered middle age man in Shopgirl, Murray's character is much more likeable.      It's easy to take this movie too literally and find it maybe even repulsive that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen might not be sexually attracted to each other but the beauty of this film is that, regardless of conventional social mores, it can be normal to have a platonic relationship with a person of the opposite sex.  Its not for Bill Murray fans expecting him to be the comic relief but if you give it a chance, it may end up pleasantly surprising you on a different level.
B003102JDM|5.0|I had never heard of this 2009 Coen Brothers' film even though it was nominated for two Academy Awards - one for best film of the year and another for best writing.  That's why I am so glad it was available on my local cable station.  It's an offbeat dark comedy that seems to be a labor of love for the Coen Brothers as it's set in 1967 in a Jewish suburb of Minneapolis, much like the suburb of their childhood. There's a weird introduction set a century ago in Europe and filmed in Yiddish with English subtitles in which a couple lets an elderly man into their home who might be a dybbuk (an evil spirit).  It is only later that we realize that this dybbuk has cursed the future generations of that family with a whole series of rather comic misfortunes.  This story is, in effect, a modern interpretation of the Book of Job.  And it is only because of the Coen Brothers extreme talent in producing it that I found myself sometimes laughing out loud.<br /><br />In a stunning performance Micheal Stahlberg is cast as Professor Larry Gopnik, a physics teacher who writes dozens of equations on the blackboard which his students find quite boring.  He's a poor soul who just can't seem to get anything right.  His wife wants a divorce, his children don't respect him, the man in his wife's life tries to befriend him, his lawyer can't help him, the rabbi and the dentist give him meaningless advice and no matter how hard he tries, life just keeps getting worse.  All this is told with restrained humor and pathos. I particularly loved the performance of the young Aaron Wolf who plays the part of his 13-year old son who gets stoned on his Bar Mitzvah day.<br /><br />Throughout the film, there is a constant search for meaning.  And yet, perhaps, after all, there is no meaning.  This is the big question the film raises.  I loved it not only because made me smile;  I loved it because it made me think.
0156012197|5.0|I read the Little Prince when I was in school. Over the years this book has grown over me. I love every page of this book. It has a strong message for everyone. Many of us sleep walk through life, some sleep walk all the time. We don't realize how precious our little life is on this little planet.<br /><br />The essence of this book for me lie in these lines spoken by the fox to the Little Prince:<br /><br />\\"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\\"<br />the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br /><br />\\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is the time I have wasted for my rose-\\"<br />said the little prince so he would be sure to remember.<br /><br />\\"Men have forgotten this truth,\\" said the fox. \\"But you must not forget it.<br />You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.<br />You are responsible for your rose...\\"<br /><br />\\"I am responsible for my rose,\\"<br />the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.

B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this book I cannot tell you!  I was drawn to it because I, myself, am a true shopaholic.  I shop during my lunch  break, after work (not every day) and on weekends with friends.  It is how we spend time and it's fun. The only problem was  it was hurting my bank account - wait, what bank account?  If you are like me you have to read the only book that has helped  me with my shopping therapy problem and I bought it on Kindle.  It's called 101 Ways to Stop Shopping and Start Saving on Kindle store.  This past weekend I didn't buy ANYTHING!  That's a huge improvement for someone like me.  I recommend this book and the kindle book  if you want to stop shopping!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Nice and easy to purchase a whole season in a single shot.  No problems with dvd's.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I do surveys for amazon gift certificates and buy stuff I really want.  Well my wife saw the set of Vampire Diary on your sight and just had to have it.  Well there went my gun repair book, LOL.  We ordered on Sunday night and had the set Tuesday morning in the Mail.  Very pleasant surprise.
0061914177|2.0|The first three chapters of this book said nothing of importance.  The main message of the author is that social networking is the key to success for your new business. He obviously is is a huge fan of blogging.  If you don't blog, such as myself, than you either shouldn't buy the book or learn to enjoy blogging.  His ideas include social networking via Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites. I'm not a fan of Facebook and I don't have time to twitter all day.  Obviously this explains my rating on this book.   The book had a few good resources for new social networking sites. One is better off reading only Chapter 10 and Appendix A.  In these two sections he summarizes the entire book.
0525951652|5.0|I have been eager to read another Follett historical book, after unexpectedly loving Pillars and World. I was a bit hesitant to read a more current book, however, figuring I already knew most of 20th Century history. Boy, was I wrong! This book educated me, held me enthralled, and educated me. I have only one criticism of it: heavy. I do a large share of my reading in bed at night, and this was a heavy guy to hold.    You guys who are complaining about the price of the Kindle book are being unfair to both book and author.    It is worth the $$ no matter what format you choose. Buy it, read it, and see if you understand war and its promoters and human struggles any better.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I never understood why OEMs didn't include HDMI cables in their product boxes. The latest Xbox 360 still comes with RCA cables, and not even the component cables. The HDMI cables are inexpensive to make, but a lot of manufacturers like to overprice them to project the idea their cables are superior in some way. I think of HDMI cables like USB cables. I don't see people running around buying $50 gold-plated USB cables. Sure there are varying degrees of quality, but everything I've seen and read about HDMI indicated the basic $8 HDMI cables would suffice.<br /><br />My experience with using the Amazon HDMI cable was a positive one. I use it with my Xbox 360S 250GB and Asus LCD gaming monitor at 1080P. Zero complaints. It just does the job without any problems.<br /><br />Pros: Inexpensive, high quality, gets the job done<br /><br />Cons: None.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars
0805091742|5.0|I've always been a fan of checklists and have long admired how my wife uses them whenever packing for trips . . . she rarely misses to bring along anything we might need, and she can complete packing in a relatively short time.<br /><br />Apparently, she is not the only person who successfully uses such checklists--as I found in a book I very much enjoyed: THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO (see also Sections 2 and 11) by writer and surgeon Atul Gawande. He studied failures in a wide variety of situations and determined that they were often caused by the volume and complexity of knowledge today.<br /><br />So how can you do better? Just try using a checklist and when you do, keep it simple. For example, here's what happened at the Kaiser hospitals in Southern California:<br /><br />* Researchers had tested their checklist for six months in thirty-five hundred operations. During that time, they found that their staff's average rating of the teamwork climate improved from \\"good\\" to \\"outstanding.\\" Employee satisfaction rose 19 percent. The rate of OR nurse turnover--the proportion leaving their jobs each year--dropped from 23 percent to 7 percent. And the checklist appeared to have caught numerous near errors. In one instance, the preoperative briefing led the team to recognize that a vial of potassium chloride had been switched with an antibiotic vial--a potentially lethal mix-up. In another, the checklist led the staff to catch a paperwork error that had them planning for a thoracotomy, an open-chest procedure with a huge front-to-back wound, when what the patient had come in for was actually a thoracoscopy, a videoscope procedure done through a quarter-inch incision.<br /><br />Looking at another industry, the author pointed out that pilots turn to their checklist for two reasons:<br /><br />* First, they are trained to do so. They learn from the beginning of flight school that their memory and judgment are unreliable and that lives depend on their recognizing that fact. Second, the checklists have proved their worth--they work. However much pilots are taught to trust their procedures more than their instincts, that doesn't mean they will do so blindly. Aviation checklists are by no means perfect. Some have been found confusing or unclear or flawed. Nonetheless, they have earned pilots' faith. Face-to-face with catastrophe, they are astonishingly willing to turn to their checklists.<br /><br />And checklists can and even are used to analyze financial statements:<br /><br />* One check, for example, requires the members of the team to verify that they've read the footnotes on the cash flow statements. Another has them confirm they've reviewed the statement of key management risks. A third asks them to make sure they've looked to see whether cash flow and costs match the reported revenue growth.<br /><br />I'd like to tell you more about the book, but looking at my checklist of things to do, I see it is now time to do a next thing on my list; i.e., proof what I just typed . . . and then it will be time to get some much-needed sleep.worth--they work.

B0040YFR1Y|3.0|I do have the blu-ray version. Quality or clarity is \\"ok\\" not as clear as say Transformers as an example. I was REALLY looking forward to watching this because I LOVED Predator 1 and I knew they were trying to get that same feeling but the problem is is that they used the SAME lines.. the SAME plot! I mean I felt like I was watching part 1 again but a 2010 version. There was Arnold again covered with mud with a girl at the end! They could have had the \\"team\\" feeling again WITHOUT the same story. I can't even give this a 4 star rating. I didn't feel like COOL this was pretty good. I felt, it was so so at the end when I turned it off. Yes they did add a few new monsters (the dogs were cool) but then they kept adding the old sayings and movements. Everytime I heard or saw something from part 1 set my mood backwards. I didn't feel that edge of my seat feeling I had with part 1. I would have had a better experience if they just made it fresh like some of the movie is. It was like watching a re-make is almost the feeling. But trying to re-make something that didn't need re-made.
1594488843|5.0|Forget what you think you know about motivating people at work, at school and at home . . . in particular, get rid of the notion that the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach of offering a combination of rewards and punishments is the best way to get somebody to do something.<br /><br />According to Daniel H. Pink, author of DRIVE: THE SURPRISING TRUTH ABOUT WHAT MOVIATES US, there's now a better way to get both high performance and satisfaction in today's world; i.e., give people the opportunity to direct their own lives . . . also, give them the opportunity to learn and create new things.<br /><br />What I liked about the CD version of the book I heard was the fact that Pink didn't just present glib theories; rather, he used real-life examples . . . for instance, perhaps the most amazing one was that of Wikipedia vs. Microsoft . . . the former developed an encyclopedia with the help of volunteers that managed in a relatively short time to top the efforts of Microsoft that used paid employees to produce and sell its multimedia encyclopedia called Encarta.<br /><br />Among the many other tidbits I gained from the author were the following:<br /><br />* Higher rewards don't lead to higher performances.<br /><br />* Financial incentives can result in a negative drop in performance.<br /><br />* Rewards by their very nature narrow our focus.<br /><br />* Pay your kid to take out the trash, and you'll never get him or her to do it again for free.<br /><br />* It's best to make rewards unexpected and to give them out after the job is done.<br /><br />* Autonomy can be a very important motivational factor.<br /><br />* Zappo's doesn't monitor call time or use scripts.<br /><br />* Some companies are routing calls to individual's homes. Jet Blue was one of the first to do this.<br /><br />* Listen to what workers say . . . do they use \\"I\\" vs. \\"we.\\" We wins!<br /><br />Lastly, DRIVE gave a very pragmatic series of exercises to that could be done on a company and/or individual basis . . . here's one that I really liked:<br /><br />* Give employees a FedEx Day . . . allow them to set aside an entire day. They can do whatever they want, as long as they deliver something back to the company the next day.<br /><br />What a great concept!t aside an entire day. They can do whatever they want, as long as they deliver something back to the company the next day.     What a great concept!
B001LMU182|5.0|I know this movie since I'm 13... It's a big hit in France for my generation, and I did not watch it since 10 years maybe. I bought it because my US friends did not know about this anime. It blow my mind, again. It's crazy to thing that film was made in 88. It changed the way of designing video games forever, and video games changed the way of designing movies. I'm just affraid about what Hollywood it's going to do when they'll try to remake it...
0307454541|5.0|I bought this book as everyone has been raving about it.  Everyone says that the beginning is slow, which is true.  However, the story is really interesting and is very suspenseful.  I found myself unable to put the book down once the two protagonists meet and join to solve the mystery.  I look forward to the next two books in the series.

B001J710Y8|4.0|I'll just sum up my feelings about this movie rather than describing the plot, etc.  Read other reviews for details about the plot.<br /><br />The Wicker Man (1973) is a strange, I mean VERY strange horror movie.  It stars Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento, Ingrid Pitt, and Christopher Lee.  A police sergeant is investigating a young girl's disappearance on a remote island called Summerisle.  The islanders practice Celtic neopagan cult rituals with animal sacrifices and the supernatural, which the sergeant finds disturbing.  The movie is upbeat at times, scary at times, and gets more and more bizarre as it progresses, but it's definitely entertaining and will hold your attention.<br /><br />There is a lot of nudity.  Topless women and nude women dancing.  There is full nudity at times.  There are couples screwing in a churchyard at night and one scene shows a naked woman crying next to a tombstone.  This is one of those bizarre early '70s British films.  The Wicker Man is the centerpiece late in the movie and the ending is quite bizarre.<br /><br />This DVD is in widescreen and has a featurette called \\"The Wicker Man Enigma\\", which is all about the movie and how it came to be.  Also included is the theatrical trailer, TV spot, radio spots, talent bios, and is closed captioned in English.<br /><br />If you crave watching a horror movie that's bizarre and unusual, then try this one.  It's ranked as the sixth greatest British film of all time.  I recommend it.

B0041OOJNU|4.0|Back in her element, Colombian songwriter Shakira aces it again with a bilingual album that sails flawlessly through a variety of genres. Her voice comes out pristine, her lyrics capture the soul of her poetry. Sale el Sol triumphs as a mortar of emotions, a conjunction of artistic perspectives, and succeeds in creating abundance with simplicity.    After the contrived electronic experimentation of She Wolf, Shakira went back to basics in what she has called the best record of her career. \\"I'm very excited about the new album,\\" she told MTV News, \\"because it reminds me of different eras and stages of my career. It's like a synthesis of all these 20 years.\\" Combining the festive music of Dominican Republic and Colombia with the edge of rock and pop she gives us a ride through a sonic range that reflects the two currents feeding this work: the melancholy ballads about heartbreak and the joyful, upbeat party tunes.     Unlike her previous records, Sale el sol is stripped from any pompous production, a characteristic noticeable from the opening title track that instantly transports the listener back to 1998.  Lead single Loca features reggaeton artist El Cata and is the most contagious track of the album, if we do not consider World Cup Theme Waka Waka, included here in three different versions to the delight of all soccer fanatics.     Although her songwriting is not as vivid and inventive as it once was, no chance is wasted to explore her trademark florid rhyming and the rupture of lyrical structure into innuendos. Gordita, featuring potty-mouthed Calle 13 singer René Pérez, is a comical and flirtatious duet exchange that exploits the base track of El condor pasa and an irresistible accordion. Mariposas is undoubtedly a Gustavo Cerati song. He lends his guitar to create another pop gem that is sure to pulverize the airwaves. She nails an amazing cover of The xx's Islands, infusing it with new life and pumping beats, ready for the dance floor.     The counterpart comes with Antes de las seis, her most heartfelt composition since Antologia that in mere 2:57 minutes reduces the explosive stage potential of the whole record to the intimacy of a confessional, and Lo que mas, which continues her tradition of breathtaking ballads This is when she shines: beyond the movement of hips that don't lie and baritone vocals capable of choking ears, she bares a harrowing lament of lost love and devotion without giving in to sentimentality.    It is impossible not to compare Shakira's recent material with those early records from the mid nineties. The progression from local songstress into world phenomenon came, at times, with the sacrifice of a sound that some of her followers proclaimed as her essence. A quick listen of Sale el Sol results in the impression that it is nothing else than a collection of unknotted singles, but in paying it more attention one discovers that she has not abandoned her roots and has rather smartly incorporated them into a wider, more appealing product that blends cultures and unites idiosyncrasies.
B004132HZS|5.0|As many ppl have already said, this show is amazingly well-crafted, featuring witty, clever dialogue, genuinely interesting plots (although the climax in the first ep will probably be guessed by the audience before on-screen Sherlock cracks it), and really, really charismatic actors.  The only downside i can see is that, like all BBC shows, this is definitely expensive. By my calculations, for this price, you can get at least 100 mins more of programming in other, US-based shows -- now whether the quality is equivalent, is really up to you ;)    ps: I haven't bought the dvd yet (i saw the series on tv), so i can't comment on the extra features, etc.    Summary: If you don't mind the fact that there are only 3 90-minute episodes in this 'season', snap it up! Otherwise, it might be better to wait for a cheaper anthology (although the doctor who's (from 2005 onwards), still remain as pricey as ever).
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|This show is quite possibly one of my absolutely favorite shows ever. But this season in particular made me cry at the beginning, laugh out loud in the middle, and cry at the end. Well worth the money and time and lost sleep. I love love love it. Well done Chandra Wilson for creating such a fantastic cast of characters that you can't stop watching from day one.
B00006JMQG|5.0|A young man retells the story of a horrible traveling carnival attraction and its owner, the nefarious Dr. Caligari, who uses the sleepwalker from his act to commit a series of murders throughout the German township of Holstenwall. CALIGARI is an incredible visual experience that rose out of the Expressionist movement in post-World War I Germany. Drawing from the art movement of the same name, the set designs and backdrops are riddled with awkward, uneven lines that protrude at acute angles and in twisted forms. This creates an unnerving and nightmarish world in which the characters dwell. The artful framing and dissolves are shrouded in a dark fog that further enhances the dream like quality of the picture. Each of the actors create striking characters through their exaggerated performances, the most memorable of which has to be Conrad Veidt's ghastly portrayal of Cesare, the sinuous and frightening somnambulist. The brilliantly scripted reveal following Francis' framed story delivery of the plot introduces an unexpected twist in a chilling grand finale. THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is regarded as one of the finest achievements in the genre, and currently ranks within the Top Ten Horror Films of all time on The Internet Movie Database.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
0786955570|4.0|I'm saying this first and foremost:  Most of this game is compatible with any d20 fantasy gaming system. Miniatures, tiles, markers, you can use these wherever.  Almost all of it looks to be compatible with 4th Edition Dungeons and Dragons. So, if you're looking to get into 4th Edition, you can actually use this as a booster.    This game is a lot of fun. It does require some careful reading, but, after a few games, you'll get the hang of it. It used to take us a few minutes to do a turn, now its like clockwork. Its very easy to pick up.    The adventures are lots of fun too. There are 13 adventures (2 single player and 11 group) to play, each one with their own alterations of the rules.    Another nice thing, especially if you have a smaller group, is there is no \\"dungeon master\\". Everyone is working together.    the mini's are unpainted, but this helps you quickly find the monsters in the box. I'm planning on atleast painting the heros and vilians; I wish they'd used a better base color than dark blue for the heros.    I've already preordered the new one that comes out in february.
B0014J8D9Q|1.0|REally? I love clint eastwood the director, I love gran torino and a bunch of his other directorial lead movies.  This movie? really? I STRUGGLED to watch it, i was checking emails, getting up, i kept WAITING for it to get better or something to happen...maybe this is a guyflick...i didn't get it and didn't see why it was so AMAZING...believe I can get as deep and existential as the next person but this is a way over hyped movie IMO
1439190275|1.0|About 8 years ago I read Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution and my life changed dramatically as a result. He articulated the science behind his philosophy so clear that anyone could understand it and yet so detailed that a doctor could learn from it.<br />I just recently bougtht this book as a refresher and I was shocked. I don't know what the Atkin's people are thinking. Dr. Atkins would roll over in his grave if he could read this newer book. I felt badly for him. In this new book they actually tell you that you may have to count calories. Oh my word! What heresy! They even tell you that you should be careful with fat. Again-HERESY! It not only goes against his teachings it goes against the science of it. In fact they don't really even talk much at all about the science.<br />Please don't waste your time, money, and failure to lose weight on this book. Buy the real Atkins diet book, \\"Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution\\" by Robert C. Atkins himself. His explaination of the program is so very crucial. We all know that knowledge is powerful... right? Then buy the book that can give you the knowledge you need for inspiration and determination.<br />Dr. Atkins was so radical and controversial and this new book written by these new Atkins people wouldn't upset anyone. They have catered to the more mainstream thinking and certainly wouldn't upset the apple cart like Robert Atkins so boldly did.<br />Get the real Atkins Diet from the man himself.
143911000X|5.0|Everyone heard the \\"Bros before Ho'es\\", now you have the rest of them as well. I actually listened to the Audio Book first and then decided to have a written copy of the rules, so I can quote them correctly! The book is printed in a way to look like an old document, (font and paper), so you can pretend you are read the 'Federalist Papers'! Also, even if you don't know who Barney is, you can still enjoy the book, it's that fun
1439181780|5.0|This book is awesome. I have seen the video of \\"The Secret\\" read all of \\"Rhonda Byrne 's books that I have found.  It really is an eye opener. And I think if you have read other books of this type, you will love this one.

B00433LYBY|5.0|Selena is absolutly amazing! She definitly matured in this album and the songs are really catchy! It's really a great CD!
B003NWS5AO|4.0|\\"Band of Joy\\" features Robert Plant backed by an all-star Nashville band including Buddy Miller, Darrell Scott, and Byron House.  Patty Griffin supplies backing vocals throughout.    The level of talent brought together guarantee a certain level of proficiency.  The songs are old country and R&B chestnuts.  Most of the songs are mid-tempo.  This is not a Robert Plant vanity project.  All participants are clearly having a great time.  I enjoyed this album thoroughly, and only the absence of a real up-tempo barn-burner kept it from a five-star rating.
1439153663|5.0|Though I purchase quite a lot from Amazon, I'm not one to write reviews usually. I think this may be only the second time. This book however deserves the plug.  It was great! I haven't had a book that kept me so intrigued as this one did in a long time. The one thing that kept going through my mind, other than the fact that I couldn't put the book down, was how terrible slavery was. I have a hard time trying to imagine how anyone could treat another human being like slaves were treated. I'm sorry it took as long as it did to stop. Again this was a very good book, I would highly recomend it.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Hey, it's just about the funniest show on TV.  Two episodes (\\"Modern Warfare\\" and \\"American Poultry\\") are instant classics.  The DVDs include copious special features and commentaries.  This is an excellent DVD set that does a great first season proud.

B000063JZQ|4.0|Bizarre, but then when has Polanski been otherwise? Bizarre but effective. Finch is good but not startlingly so. The exquisite Francesca Annis is frighteningly real as Lady MacBeth. Locations are perfect and complete a compelling film.
1577314808|1.0|I ordered the book \\"the Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightment\\" and received a totally different book.  I sent two emails to the seller explaining the mistake and I have not received any feedback or the book.  I am extremely disappointed with this transaction.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I downloaded the sample to my kindle and enjoyed the first few pages and was ready to purchase the book when I noticed the price was $19.99 for the ebook and $19.39 for the hardcover version!  I'm giving the publisher 1 star for greed.
B0043XDV8I|5.0|Another great interpretation of a classic tale. Russel Crowe delivers another great performance as he did in \\"Gladiator\\". Before purchasing this movie, I viewed it on pay-per-view and I loved it. The third reason was that it was being offered in a Bluray + DVD + Digital Copy package.
B000W93CHC|4.0|World Without End was a good book but Pillars of the Earth was an excellent book. I know I should not compare them but I just loved Pillars of the Earth so much. World Without End seemed to take a while before the story line even began. I did enjoyed the complicated relationships between the characters. Reading about the Plague and how they each were touched by the disease was very interesting. Its defiantly worth reading its just not as good as Pillars of the Earth.
0061733199|3.0|If you're the self-sufficient type than this is a book you should read. If you don't think that you'll need to defend your homestead, than you should read this book.  If you don't think that you will ever use anything in this book, than you should read this book.  Yes, I think that if you are a human with a pulse that you should read this book.  It's that good.
B00063F8B2|5.0|As soon as my Grandson heard the music he ran to the TV only to find it wasn't on. He loves the movie and the music so this is nice to have along the way driving and oh yeal Grandma likes it a lot also.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I cannot really improve on the other excellent reviews posted here.  My biggest \\"concern\\" was the last review date was Feb 2006 ;)  So I am posting this to let others know - this stand is still EXCELLENT.<br /><br />I needed two decent, inexpensive LCD desk mounts for my home office IKEA desk.  My goal was to improve the amount of working space I had on my desk.  I did my online research and while I found cheaper ones, I kept coming back to this one.  I just felt more comfortable buying these from Amazon.<br /><br />I have two ASUS 24\\" widescreen monitors (VW246H and VE246H).  I had both monitors installed on these mounts within an hour or so - and that included cleaning my desk ;)<br /><br />These mounts are VERY well made, and look very smart.  I have them screwed onto my desk though there are other mounting options also. The pad between the mount and my desk is very durable, so I am not concerned about any damage to my desk top.  My monitors are so sturdy on these mounts that I have zero concerns about them getting hurt.<br /><br />My monitors now \\"float\\" over my desk, easily movable to anywhere I need them.  The best part is how much extra USABLE space I have on my desk!  I couldn't be happier!  Worth every cent.... 5 STARS
B00005N6KG|5.0|Best 8 bucks ive ever spent! Much better than any other earbud ive used, and light yrs ahead of the cheapos that come with your ipod. I mostly use em at the gym or walking my little pain in the a$$ dog..whereas most earbuds wont stay in and continuously fall out these babies stay in...everytime! Theyre light, comfortable and most importantly they stay in your ears...you wont even know theyre there...they look cool too as theyre very modern and unobtrusive...Cons- they are thin and lightweight so not sure how long theyll last...they could use a little more bass though the sound is amazing...and the cord is a bit short, which isnt too much of a prob as I usually just stick the excess in my shirt anyhow...for 8 bucks these are a no brainer...did I mention theyre sony too? buy em! highly reccomended!

Douglas)NOT shown in subs, but we will check in the upcoming Criterion edition soon to be released).<br /><br />Shall I go on...?<br /><br />Star Was WAS a great film, when I saw it, alone May 25th. 1977 Showcase Cine. W. Springfield MA. 12:00 Noon.<br /><br />Yes, I was the only customer there, and only two staff members working. You can thank Star Log for that. George, you said and I quote, \\"... I would not want to direct again, too many hats.\\" So why did you and your X go back and trash the entire sound about 4 or 5 months into the first run?<br /><br />No one cared that almost 100% of the film was based on other movies and books, we all loved it and myself, I felt and still feel today that the 5.1 sound (called \\"6 Track\\" then), that you and Coppola came up with was great, I only needed to hear the 2nd. cut back in 77' That was it...<br /><br />Give us back our movie George, and introduce it to the current generation. Bring back the fun.
0756405890|5.0|This is a MUST read! I dont know how I am going to wait until Feb for the next book! This story ranks in my top 5. I loved it!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This story of a man's life is told through the simple perspective of his dog. Often the dog's assumptions of what is happening are clearer than a human's with all the knowledge at hand. This was an interesting book to read and it stayed with me more for the sweetness of its narrator than the story of the man. And in the end, we all hope to \\"come back\\" as more and better than we are now.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|What we have here is five very tallented musicians who are free to create to their utmost without being dominated by the great Ritchie Blackmore.  This entire record is so good I can't stop playing it.  I was already a Glenn Hughes fan and a Tommy Bolin fan.  To have them both in a great band like Deep Purple was a gift from God.  At least for me because this is my kind of music.  If you appreciate real classic rock by musicians who have mastered their instruments (unlike the monkey asses you hear on the radio nowadays) then listen, as I did, to the reviewers on this page and make this CD a part of your collection.  More than likely, after the last song plays, you will push the play button again. And again, and again...It's just that good.  Trust me.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Sound of Silver is consistently interesting and entertaining. The first track (\\"Get Innocuous\\") sets the pace by laying some Berlin-era Bowie-style vocals over a funky electronic groove. The rest of the CD is similarly experimental and catchy.
B0043ZDFEQ|3.0|I had high expectations.  I enjoyed about half the album.  There are many songs that sounds a lot like Michael Jackson songs.  I like Michael Jackson, but I expected a more Jason Mraz sound from Bruno Mars (which he gives on songs like \\"Just The Way You Are\\" and \\"The Lazy Song\\").  My personal favorite tracks are \\"The Lazy Song\\" and \\"Count On Me\\"
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Good:    1) Characters  2) Stories  3) Lines    Bad:    1) Can't think of any.

B0042U94UQ|4.0|Okay, first let me be clear. I in no way wanted to go and see this movie. Why did I go? Well that is what you have to do when you have a 10 year old brother and the parents don't want to take him to see it. Anyway, twenty minutes into the movie I started to think that the movie was okay for younger children, because it was quite a silly plot line (the main aim in the plot is that they want to shirink the moon) and was maybe lacking in some emotion. However, I have to admit by the end of the movie I quite enjoyed it, you really get to see Gru (our villian turned dad),on his journey and see the changing emotions he has to go through, not to mention the decisions he has to make. Some of the scenes our quite touching and some of the dialogue is quite humerous.   Now I just want to mention the cast, there is a very good cast including the very funny Steve Carell, Jason Segal, Julie Andrews, Russell Brand leading the cast but of course I have to give credit to the actresses who played the three girls Miranda Cosgrove who was excellent playing the smart older sister, Dana Gaier as the moody teenager and finally there is Elsie Fisher who at about 8 years old is a natural.  So overall I think that this is a great family movie, the kids will enjoy it more but I enjoyed it and I am a 16 year old girl, however i think that it isnt a movie I would watch over and over again but I think children would.  It is definatley worth a watch.
030745455X|5.0|Great follow-up to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. It isn't as graphic as the first book (except for the very end), but the writing is just as good. I liked that the characters evolved (these aren't static things that are unchanged from the first page of the first book). The ending is quite a cliff hanger.

B002ZG994U|3.0|The movie revival of the A-Team isn't bad at all - (I do however miss George Peppard, Mr T. and the original team).  It has funny moments, all out action, but the film doesn't pack as much of a punch if you've just watched The Losers OR Stallone's The Expendables. I'd say the A-Team matches up with the Expendables, but the Losers edges it out for true grit.<br /><br />Watch all 3 in a row, and they might start to look like cousins of the same film - ie. a bunch of renegade soldiers of fortune try to fight for their freedom and / or truth, justice and action the American way.  Substitute the cast and vary the action sequences - Expendables gets a B for straight action, while the Losers and the A-Team compete for creativity...the A-Team is slicker, but while Liam Neeson does a great job - I will say it again - no-one will replace Mr. T - who WAS the role he played, or Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz.  Jessica Biel doesn't really add much to the mix.  The hairbrained go-for-broke schemes of the original A-Team are given the Hollywood glossy treatment - there are admittedly some inspired moments like the Tank in the air...<br /><br />Most viewers - especially if you haven't experienced the original incarnation of the A-Team, should enjoy this.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|I love this release for its raw beauty and soulful artistry by the ensemble as a whole.  Mr. Plant is unapologetically singing songs he loves with musicians quite capable of giving his distinctive voice the context it deserves.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|A young woman pursues her dream of searching for extraterrestrial life, then must deal with the consequences when her efforts appear to pay off.<br /><br />More than a science fiction thriller about the possiblity of life on other planets, this movie is a meditation on the persistence of the human spirit. In that regard, it is similar to [[ASIN:B000WQWPJQ Cast Away [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />From \\"Death Becomes Her,\\" to \\"Back To The Future,\\" to \\"Forrest Gump,\\" big league director Robert Zemeckis is one of the very best. He never lets the special effects dominate the movie, but very skillfully uses them to support the<br />story.<br /><br />This movie is a fitting tribute to Carl Sagan and his novel.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I absolutely love this series, and this season is no exception. The DVD menus are user-friendly and easily navigable. The extras are really fun and interesting. The commentaries are very entertaining and, of course, the show itself is phenomenal. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B0029O0BLS|2.0|This movie had most of the ingredients for a great psychological sci-fi thriller - an interesting plot, good cast, and decent special effects (the Blu-ray transfer looks excellent).<br /><br />Unfortunately, it fails to deliver, mainly due to a poor screenplay.<br /><br />The characters never fully form or connect emotionally, and the dialog doesn't help. The authority figure played by Peter Coyote suffers the worst.<br /><br />The end of the movie is flaccid and actually kind of funny.<br /><br />A more successful movie in the same vein was [[ASIN:B00009ATIX Solaris]].
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This season is the best yet.  Season six is making me anxious for the next episode.  Something is not quite right about Sam.  Every year seems to get better and better.  My only complaint is that after I got the DVD from Amazon....I found it $10 cheaper locally.

0316010669|5.0|Blink: The Power of Thinking; Without Thinking    This book is about how we process our mind. How the subconscious take places before the conscious.  The author presents a series of studies and experiments to supports its point.  So Blink it is that nano second that human's take to have a feeling about a situation or event. I really enjoy reading this book and could relate a lot of the book facts with my professional experience.    Some of the examples that Gladwell, the author, gives are very real, although the book was written to the United States environment with some minor modifications it is possible to adapt to different cultures around the globe. The main point is that we can have an opinion and a certain hunch before we have a logical explanation for the fact. One of the most amazing examples was about the couple forecasting of the probability on the divorce. The book show studies that with as little as three minutes of tape of a couple it be done this forecast. The thin slice technique gives the researchers a great ability to forecast.    The IDAT test is amazing, test that requires the person who is taking the test to associate groups or categories to words or pictures. For my professional experience we had to educate our work force, over and over again, to avoid unconscious associations that would result in a lost of a sale or reduce value perception in our service quality.    Another point that the book make is how easy, or at least predicable is to marketing once we understand the Blink decisions of the general market, the point here was proven with the President Harding election, although he was one of the worse president in the American history, he had the physical imagine of a tall and strong person, and due his imagine he was elected the president. This point was also made with the CEOs of big corporation which also prefer to have a tall and strong male.    The counterpoint of a success auto sales man proves that the individuals or companies that prepare them to have an open mind, the results of IDAT test will be change and the potential of a greater positive result in the market place are astronomical.     My personal suggestion is that every decision maker has to address cultural issues and deal with the subconscious. And the more knowledge on these topics it is best to forecast, and gain market share of profitability. So use this knowledge to address advertising campaign and sales strategies.
143911000X|5.0|I bought this book for a birthday gift and the person loved it. The condition of the book was in good shape!!!
0316069485|1.0|I have to disagree with many of the other reviewers of this book. A one word review for it would be \\"clumsy\\", a three word review \\"clumsy and boring\\". I like Connelly's books a lot and have read them all, most more than once. This is possibly the worst.  The shifting viewpoint between Haller and Bosch is clumsy and doesn't add anything to the narrative. As a legal thriller it's nothing more than standard fare that has been done better countless times in other books and TV series. No real suspense is ever developed in Bosch's investigation or in the trial. The characters and their relationships undergo no development.    When you're done with this book, you will wish you had your money back and the 3 or 4 hours you spent reading it.
0743233832|5.0|This book is filled with wisdom for life and living.  I have gotten much sustenance from it's pages.
142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero is the story of three new half-bloods: Jason, Piper, and Leo. The three are students at a wilderness boarding school for troubled teens, only Jason doesn't remember anything before the moment the story begins. Piper is Jason's girlfriend, and Leo is his best friend, and they've known him for months, so he must be who they say he is, right? Before they can unravel this mystery, however, they're attacked by a storm that seems intent on killing just the three of them, and their teacher suddenly has hooves.<br /><br />To say anything else about the plot would reveal some very excellent surprises, and one of the great joys of this book is trying to guess where the story is going. Fans should be reassured that old favorites return, and Riordan does an excellent job of including them in the story while still making this a new series. I can't wait for the next book, and I love knowing that there's a new Camp Half-Blood book each fall for the next several years. Percy Jackson fans will not be disappointed by this new series.
B003ZDZ22U|4.0|This is a great final album for the Hannah Montana series. There are a number of catchy songs for the kids and everything is clean (unlike some of the other material Miley has been releasing).  The only problem is that there are a few too many slow songs on this CD. There are good slow songs that have a catchy beat (like Barefoot Cinderella), then there are the slow songs that bring out the weaknesses in Miley's voice (like I'll Always Remember You). I know many listeners like her ballads because of their strong messages, but a couple of these songs sound warped by electronic processing. But overall it's a good CD to buy for those that love the TV show.
0316077054|5.0|Beautiful Darkness picks up immediately following the events of Beautiful Creatures, and then fast-forwards to the end of the school year. Lena continues to grieve following the death of her Uncle Macon, and she pulls away from Ethan, who doesn't know how to help her despite his own recent experience with loss. Things only get worse for them when two new people come to town, and their doomed romance becomes even more difficult. Can Ethan help Lena choose between Light and Dark, or are the obstacles between Mortal and Caster too great to overcome?<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness has everything that I loved about the first book, and avoids many of the mistakes that second books fall prey to. I love the setting and the characters, and with 500+ pages, there is plenty of room for both. The book is filled with details about life in Gatlin, and this makes the Mortal world of the story as exotic as the Caster, at least to this Yankee. The problems between Ethan and Lena are also organic to the story. Anyone who has ever reached the end of a paranormal romance and wondered how the relationship will actually really survive once the adventure is over will appreciate this novel. I also love the character of Ethan, and I'm glad that the story continues to be told from his point of view. And though this book leaves me completely satisfied, something else that many second books fail to do, I'm already eagerly awaiting the next book in this series.

0399536108|5.0|The Art of Non-Conformity is a great book.<br /><br />I've recently been reading a lot of books on time management, thought processes, and business. These have radically opened my mind to new ideas and helped me reflect a lot more about myself and my life.<br /><br />The Art of Non-Conformity is one of the books that has had a profound impact on the way I think not only about myself, but also the world.<br /><br />Although a lot of the ideas presented in the book seem to be largely 'simplistic' in nature, reading them all in one place together, along with detailed explanations and storytelling really makes them stick with you.<br /><br />Since reading this book, I've spent a lot of time thinking about what I want out of life, and how to achieve it. I realized that I've been letting myself get drawn into the buzz of daily life without planning my future accordingly.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to change their life for the better. It will help you clarify your thought processes, and make you more self-aware of your own life and actions.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Woody Allen's recent relationship movie with Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson was a nice surprise. I'm not a Woody Allen fan, but occasionally he crafts a movie that appeals to me. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) is one of those films, along with Match Point (2005). Both films get 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. I think what I really liked about Vicky Cristina Barcelona was the complexity and absurdity of the love triangles between the main characters. From my point of view and experience, Allen does a great job of capturing the craziness that can come with love triangles and relationships in general. Relationships are messy and undefined at times, especially in the early stages. All of the actors in this film have spectacular chemistry with each other and it really comes through in their performances throughout the film.<br /><br />Of course you can't beat the setting in Spain for the film. The golden saturated cinematography is very pleasing to look at. You feel like you're on a European summer vacation while watching the film (as the still images below showcase). I even felt a little sun-burned at the end of the film! What Woody Allen specializes in is movies about people and their interactions with each other. This is definitely an \\"adult\\" movie in terms of its topic...it probably wouldn't interest anyone under 30. I never would have watched this film 5-10 years ago, but now that I'm in my 30s, I find myself interested in social dynamics, relationships, romance and love. Check this movie out for an easy going tale that feels like you're sipping a fine wine with friends on the patio.
0780619676|2.0|Jim Carrey likes to be an off-the-wall goofball. This movie is perfect for him.    During the day, Carrey gets to be mild-mannered Stanley Ipkiss. A guy so nice that everyone walks all over him. But at night he's The Mask - his inner self. No restraints, no restrictions, everything goes.    That would have been fine with me. But this movie has Ipkiss/The Mask committing crimes (bank robbery, assault, breaking out of jail). It also has a lot of smoking. And sadly, the only one who changes is Stanley. He learns to be less inhibited. By donning The Mask, he realizes his nice guy persona is just a mask he wears because he thinks he won't be accepted for who he really is.    The Mask would have been a MUCH better movie if they had left the criminal activity out and explored the Mask part a lot more.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|It's been a few weeks since I saw The Social Network (2010), director David Fincher's latest cinematic creation. I decided I wanted to give the movie some time to sink in before writing about it. There was a lot of hype (and there still is) for this film, and I was anxious to see what all the hype was about. The trailer certainly sparked my interest and hooked me into seeing it on opening day. Written by Aaron Sorkin, famous for The West Wing TV series and A Few Good Men (1992), The Social Network is the \\"Facebook\\" movie that has been buzzed about most of this year. It supposedly tells the story of the creation of Facebook from the major players that were involved in its birth, specifically founder Mark Zuckerberg, as played by actor Jesse Eisenberg. But no one really knows if this is the \\"truth\\" behind Facebook, or just great fiction by Sorkin. Both Facebook and Zuckerberg are being very quiet about the film, neither praising or criticizing it for its accuracy. It will be interesting to see if more comes out about it down the road. But regardless of the \\"truth\\" behind the story, The Social Network is a good movie well written by Aaron Sorkin and well directed by David Fincher.<br /><br />The Social Network is definitely a bit OVER-hyped in my humble opinion, much like Facebook itself. While I do think it's a good movie (3.5 stars out of 5), worth seeing in the theater, I'm not quite sure I agree with the almost unilateral high critical praise for it. Am I just missing something on this one? It's definitely an Oscar-nomination-worthy film and it will probably get a Best Picture nod, along with music, writing, and maybe acting nods. But is it the movie that defines the young \\"millennial\\" generation? Not so sure about that yet...we'll see over the next few years. I'm definitely willing to concede that this may well be another Fight Club (1999), also a David Fincher film, whose pop culture influence is more felt and understood now, a decade after its release. Fight Club seems to be a movie that defines the Gen-X (of which I am a member) and Gen-Y crowd. I didn't appreciate Fight Club as much when it first came out and when I first saw it, but now I see it as a masterpiece of filmmaking (4 out of 5 stars). I probably would have rated Fight Club at 2.5 stars back when I first saw it.<br /><br />People my age all seem to see themselves through Edward Norton's character in Fight Club, which I do for myself. While Fight Club has a more broadly appealing point of view (at least for guys), The Social Network feels very \\"selfish\\" to me. But maybe that's what the millennial generation is defined by? Being selfish, self-centered, and detached from \\"real\\" social interaction. This past decade has seemingly been all about social internet interaction. We now communicate mostly through emailing, texting, tweeting, posting, blogging, and other mobile and computer technologies. It's all self-focused interaction with technology...on our own personal schedule. If we don't feel like communicating, we just turn the technology off or tune it out. It's harder to do that with real people in person or on the phone. Who just picks up the phone and calls someone anymore for an actual conversation? I'm not \\"complaining\\" or \\"judging\\", because I fully participate in all of these social media things on a daily basis...using Facebook, Twitter, Email and my Blog religiously as my main way of communicating. I'm just making observations here and noticing how less \\"social\\" all this \\"social media\\" has made us.<br /><br />The movie itself has some incredible movie making talent within it. The cinematography by DP Jeff Cronenweth is great, with some incredible looking shots and top notch lighting. The acting for all of the key characters is very good, including music superstar Justin Timberlake, who is beginning to show his talents as an actor in addition to his talents as a musician. The music and score are fascinating and unique since they are the product of a collaboration between Trent Reznor (from the band Nine Inch Nails) and music composer Atticus Ross. I never would have guessed that Trent Reznor would create music for a Facebook movie! There are a couple scenes in the movie that are absolutely spectacular in large part due to the music. I know of at least two times I felt emotional chills run through my body as I watched the scenes and listened to the accompanying music. The movie trailer (embedded below) has a great Belgian Women's Choir cover of Radiohead's song \\"Creep\\", which makes the trailer powerful. Seems apropos that good music would come with an MTV-generation movie! I just purchased this choir version of \\"Creep\\" from iTunes, since it is one of my favorite Radiohead songs (right after \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\").<br /><br />The bottom line is that The Social Network is definitely a movie to see sooner rather than later. It's a here and now kind of movie. I'm curious to see how it holds up over the next decade like Fight Club. It's done OK box office. Nowhere near blockbuster levels, but not bad for a \\"talky\\" movie. We'll know more in 10 years whether this movie defines a generation or not. For now, I'm just glad to have another Fincher movie to talk about!eznor (from the band Nine Inch Nails) and music composer Atticus Ross.

0002256681|5.0|Mr Martin continues his absorbing tale of the Starks, Lannisters, and Targaryens. The other players only enrich the tale. I find myself rooting for Arya, crying for Sansa, hoping for Bran, wondering about Jon, and praying for King Robb. The direwolves of Winterfell add so much to the tale. I can't help wanting Tyrion to triumph too. I find myself ignoring errands and chores so I can open the book and read more. Invariably it becomes hard to put down. I rationalize, tomorrow I'll do what I needed to do today and what I need to do tomorrow. Loved it.

I am forcing myself to read it to the end. I have stopped myself from deleting it from my library many times while struggling through this book. I cannot believe all of the 5 star reviews.

B0034JKZ86|2.0|I love all Disney films so I was surprised that I walked away from this movie with a bad taste in my mouth. I hated all the voodoo scenes and ended up fast forwarding through those parts. Despite that I could swear I saw the witch doctor make a deal with the devil (or as he called it with his \\"friends on the other side\\") in exchange for the townspeople's souls. Then at the end when he didn't succeed in capturing the prince am I wrong or did they take his soul in payment? I found that just utterly awful. At the end of the movie my four year old didn't want to walk down the hallway to bed by himself because \\"the monsters from the movie\\" might get him. And that was just from what he saw on fastforward. I agree with the one reviewer, this movie is way too dark.I have no idea what Disney was thinking. They should have candy coated the bad guy way more. We won't ever be watching this movie again.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I mean, anything that features Dame Mirren, an elegant evening gown, and a .50 cal machine gun can't be all bad. Once you stop taking it seriously (something sure to happen early on), it's a riot.<br /><br />The basic message is a boomer ego-stroke: \\"Don't mess with the old guys.\\" Unfortunately, that's what happens. Retired CIA agents start dying at an alarming rate. It turns out that the decedents all worked on the one particular mission - one that Our Heroes worked on as well. So, when the hit men come after the hit men, the chase is on. And, as it progresses it reaches higher and higher into the halls of government. You know, the usual.<br /><br />In this movie, the fun is all in getting there. Bruce Willis's wise-cracking plays well against John Malkovich's slightly deranged character, Morgan Freeman's easy-going character balances them both, and Helen Mirren adds a touch of class. Then there's Mary-Louise Parker's character, Sarah, in a role like Diaz's in [[ASIN:B002ZG9864 Knight and Day]] only not as ridiculous. Keep your ears open for the one-liners. There were enough times I was the only one in the theater laughing that I might have been the only one listening, too.<br /><br />OK, maybe this isn't one for the ages. It's a heck of a way to spend a Saturday night, though.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

Supporting cast did a terrific job, as did everyone involved in this production - very well worth watching.<br /><br />-Ken

B0000004F9|3.0|After listening to Soft Machine's magnum opus \\"Third\\" countless times, I thought I would look into their first and second album.  Behold!  A combo album!  Unfortunately when purchasing this item, I overlooked in the 'Product Details' of Amazon.com that there is only one disk. Instead I made the mistake of assuming that there would be two disks because the $19.99 price tag somewhat suggests that.  Perhaps most customers prefer one CD instead of two, but I found this inconvenient when importing the music onto my computer; I had to manually edit song details so that two separate albums would appear in my music library (a nuance, yes; sorry I'm a neat-freak).<br /><br />Volume One (or more accurately self-titled \\"The Soft Machine\\")<br />This album fell short of my expectations.  I think the music was at times too repetitive (e.g. \\"We Did it Again\\") and failed to execute in places where it could have.  I also felt that there weren't really any 'catchy' melodies.  My personal favorites though on volume one would have to be \\"Why Am I So Short?\\" and \\"A Certain Kind.\\"<br /><br />Volume Two<br />Definitely different from Volume One (in a good way) with the subtraction of Kevin Ayers and the addition of Hugh Hopper.  There is whole lot of foreshadowing to what would eventually become their third album (e.g. parts of \\"Hibou, Anemone And Bear\\" sound a lot like parts from \\"Out-Bloody-Rageous \\").  Still, the album could be a bit more refinished.<br /><br />Maybe Volume One is too avante garde for my taste, but I thoroughly enjoy their album \\"Third\\" and I enjoy albums from Pink Floyd such as \\"Ummagumma.\\"  Maybe I just need to listen to the album a few more times and I will change my mind.<br /><br />I'd give this combo product four stars if it weren't for the fact that these albums need a remastering treatment from the original mastering tapes, much like Sony BMG did with Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh.<br /><br />Pros<br />- combo album (~75 minutes of music)<br />- neat booklet with notes and photos<br />- backside artwork from volume one included<br />- cover artwork from volume two included<br /><br />Cons<br />- both volumes packed onto one CD<br />- white noise (needs remastering)volume one included  - cover artwork from volume two included    Cons  - both volumes packed onto one CD  - white noise (needs remastering)
1439133948|5.0|While I would still love to read a novel about Miles' grandfather and the invasion, any book in the Vorkosigan series is a treat. This definitely did not disappoint. Well written as always and very difficult to put down; Bujold  is an author who does not let her fans down.    I have no choice but to go back and read the entire series again (for the umpteenth time).
0307474712|4.0|As I read the reviews for One Day, the first work I have read by David Nicholls, I found myself repeating one phrase over and over in my head that seemed to embody a perfect description of this book...\\"heart-wrenching\\". As we glimpse at July 15th each year following the post-university graduation festivities of Dexter and Emma, we get to see the evolution of a relationship that is far from the conventional love story I imagined when reading the book description.     As the two characters live their separate lives, we see them grow closer, grow apart, and everything in between as they age and experience the surprises and complex paths of life. In Dexter, the author explores how the ambition of materialism and culture-driven fame can leave a person wanting more and missing opportunities that could have made life more fulfilling in ways he never could have imagined until it was too late. Emma, on the other hand, moves through her life always wanting more. While Emma's professional life is one she has control over, her relationships are somewhat fumbled and always missing that one element to truly satisfy her.     David Nicholls is able to draw the reader in and gradually requires more and more of an emotional investment in these characters until the final chapters are so well-written that I found myself reading passages multiple times to let the words soak in. He explores the complacency of relationships, the effect of parental death on children, and how having one person in your life can shape your entire existence. I highly recommend this book; it left my heart pounding and me feeling as though I just wanted more.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|The Chic boxset Part 1 has been worthwhile the waiting. It is an excellent masterpiece of how disco/funk music should sound like. The well-known songs have now been remixed by Dimitri from Paris is such  a way that it sparks of energy. Also, unreleased songs from Johnny Mattis produced by Chic in the early years but never saw the daylight. The song 'Just Call me' is a groovy unreleased song from Chic sung by leadsinger Lucy Martin. All in all the boxset is a piece of Heaven.
0525951652|5.0|I could not believe how many people gave this book a bad review.  I thought it was excellent.
1439133948|5.0|The only bad thing about this book is that it ended too soon.  Ms. Bujold stands alone as a writer who can effortlessly show character development, discuss issues such as death and old age, while ploting an interesting novel.  Once I enter into a Vorkosigan novel, it is as if my life fades and I am captivated by a universe which is more real to me than reality.  In this book, Miles is a mature man of 39, a devoted husband and father, who loves his job and is good at it! Roic is more interesting and becoming more three dimensional.  I was glad to get updates on the other \\"regular\\" characters.<br /><br />I have read all the Vorkosigan books several times and now I will read them again.  My only hope is that this book may be a transition or an introduction to a new direction in the Vorkosigan series and a new big hefty book is on its way (January 2012).  The audio books are excellent and Grover Gardner is a very entertaining reader.
0374531269|4.0|I have been aware of \\"A Long Way Gone\\" for some time.  I have heard its author, Ishmael Beah, interviewed on radio and seen him briefly on television.  Broadly speaking, I knew what to expect.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I found the book to be both captivating and confronting.  Written in a very simple style, the book tells the story of the teenage years of Ishmael Beah.  Initially, he is a carefree youth but is soon swallowed up in the maelstrom of the Sierra Leone civil war.  He becomes a child soldier.  He kills willingly and without mercy.  Indeed, the number of deaths directly attributable to him is countless.  However, in time he is taken from the war by a UN sponsored arrangement that seems him struggle with normal life.  Very much, he is like the drug addict denied his source of drugs.<br /><br />\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is not for the faint hearted.  Death and its description in some detail is a constant with the book.  Yet, the book does have a real message of redemption to tell.  Ishmael Beah does eventually defeat his demons.  He does, in the end, return to normal life.  There is good that can be made from evil.<br /><br />Notwithstanding Beah's detailed account of the events of the civil war, it has been said by critics that his story has been embellished.  That is, he could not have been witness to all the events he describes.  It just wasn't logistically possible.  While this may or may not be so, it does nothing to deny the real value of \\"A Long way Gone\\".  There is a clear message of redemption in a narrative that is clear and concise.  That is, this challenge takes nothing away from the book itself.  Thoroughly recommended.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|You can look at this like a reboot of the series, if you were a fan of the original Predator movie you'll love this.  Playing \\"long tall sally\\" during the credits was a nice touch, there was even an homage to Blane, mini-gun and all :)
0312600844|1.0|Just painful.  Franzen's riding is so sophomoric and pedantic.  Dull, Long winded and uninteresting.  The words wallow on the page.  Reading his book is like walking on broken glass.  I wanted to believe the hype - that this was a great work of American fiction, but it's not.  In ten years time  no one will be forced to read this drivel.  With so many exciting American authors out there why Franzen gets  any press attention is beyond me -

0316069485|4.0|I've read most of Connelly's work, and was really disappointed in \\"9 Dragons,\\" afraid he was finished with with Harry's character.  But both Harry and Connelly are back.  This is another page-turner, with unexpected twists and turns.  Normally dismissing protocal, Harry is less reckless here than usual, creating a plot that is not so edge-of-your-seat (only 4 stars).  Still well worth reading, I devoured it in a little over a day.

0307739961|5.0|Now that I'm on my third book in this series, I have decided that I should have started making a family tree type of chart to remember who all the characters are. It's like reading a Russian novel!<br /><br />This series isn't for everyone. It's very violent and the first novel is very sexual. However, it all makes for great, never-put-the-book-down reading.
B003MC5N28|5.0|very good book. reading it for a socitety project in sixth grade. i would reccomend this to 6th grade and up. it is about a boy named jonas and he is living in a somewhat  risk free society. when jonas is chosen to be the new receiver of memory, he realizes the problems in his community. very good book! have fun reading!
0312370849|4.0|I was totally devastated by this book.  The story was so sad, it remained with me for a long time.  So much in the book spoke to me directly, my Polish Jewish roots, my aunt Ida who succeeded to escape with her little boy from the Vel d'Hiv, my having lived both in Paris and New York and being able to see in my mind the streets and the atmosphere the author described, but most of all having a teenage daughter and a little boy and seeing them in this story.  The part which takes place in 1942 is gripping and well-written. The modern day story is more shallow and I just felt like skipping over it and going back to 1942. The 1942 characters are real and we feel their pain.  I am very thankful to the author for making so many readers aware of the events which took place in Paris in 1942, and somehow reading the book and feeling the pain of those characters give us the feeling that we are honoring the victims' memory. How I wish books such as these were pure fiction and not based on real life events.    This review is by Françoise Andrijasevic
B0002KVULG|3.0|If this is the \\"best\\" version of Stoker's Dracula, then Dracula may well be in trouble. This version, although sometimes effective in spooky atmosphere, is quite mediocre and, for the most part, inaccurate and flimsy to the story. I remember watching this version as a youngster and being quite affected by the creepiness, but, years later, watching again, I realize that time really does change outlook on things. This is actually another lukewarm version of Dracula.     Non purists probably won't care a fig, but this story completely disintegrates much of the characterization from Stoker's novel (Lucy seems to be Mina, Mina seems to be Lucy...other characters are omitted, etc). This seems to kill most of the accuracy of the story. Also, in this version, they seem to make Dracula out to be some sort of rock star or something, and they kill every spec of mysteriousness about him. Within twenty minutes into the film, Dracula is conversing with Van Helsing, Jonathan Harker, Lucy, and Dr. Seward like they are old buddies. This destroys the supernatural nature of Dracula; he is just some mysterious, slick guy who they later find out is a vampire. If you compare this with the novel, you will see that Dracula becomes almost a supernatural entity that takes hold of creatures and humans. There is a malevolence about him that seems to translate to the supernatural in Stoker's novel; here, there is just a coolness with the ladies, Mina and Lucy. There is no sense of suspense or scariness at the evil one being out there; he is right there in front for all to see.     For the novel being a rather simplistic story, there really is not a definitive film version of Dracula. This, despite this story being told with countless film adaptations. Each film version seems to find a way to mess it up in some way, even some of the most popular adaptations. Lugosi's version had great atmosphere, but lacked in total story. The 1992 version was a bloody mess, figuratively and literally, althoughit had some great scenery and seem to capture the setting of the story. This version probably falls somewhere in between.     While I don't agree with the 1 or 2 star reviews, I also don't agree with the glowing 4 star average this film is getting. 3 stars is pretty much right there for this film.

What I did NOT like about this book is EVERY SINGLE picture is a \\"male\\" body so I had to go through and permanent mark out ALL the \\"male parts\\"... Ugh!!!  Don't know why they just didn't leave it blank (especially for a DK book, regardless if its for an adult or not).. there was no reason for it except in the reproductive portion of the book for obvious reasons.  My future Doctor has manyyy books on the human body & this is by far their favorite!!!  I HIGHLY recommend!!!  Go check it out at Borders ($50) then come back here to Amazon & buy it.. its cheaper!!!  hehe  ;) (or vice versa)  ;)

B002ZG99CC|2.0|ok..... i TRIED to go into this movie with an open mind. as a fan of the original (i even saw it in the theatre back in '84) i was very skeptical about this film being remade. and with good reason. as my title says, you NEVER remake a classic. and as is the case when remaking a classic film, you're going to make comparisons. it's inevitable.  and of course the story centers around a young boy named 'dre' (an obviously typical 'black' name) who moves to china with his mom and comes into confrontation with the local gang of bullies, and with the teachings of an older 'wiser' man he learns KUNG FU (AHEM!) and a set of philosophies to help him get through his troubles.  i rented this movie tonite hoping to see a good movie that reminds me of the original. unfortunately all i got was a carbon copy of it. the 2010 version is basically a shot-by-shot copy of the 1984 film, with SLIGHT differences. he comes from detriot instead of new jersey, he's younger, etc etc. but other than that it's a pretty generic reshoot of the same movie.    this movie has A LOT of problems...... and here are some of them.... (some are trivial and some are more related to the original)but all affect the movie as a whole.    1. the kid always has on some form of 'detroit' clothing. for the first hour of the movie everything he wears either says detriot on it or has a the detroit tigers 'D' logo on it or a detroit lions logo. even his backpack.  2. the acting in this is ok at best. jayden smith is ok, but his character is just too cocky and annoying for a 12 year old. jackie chan did a good job in this, thankfully being taken out of the comedic role that he usually inhabits.  3. the movie overall had no real SOUL to it. the first one was an emotional journey that had you invested in the characters and their interactions with each other. this one was just cut and paste. the characters were there just to push the story along to the end of the movie. even the music lacked soul and spirit. the music inthe original worked to also serve the plot and create emotion. songs like 'cruel summer' and 'you're the best' fit the scenes they were in and signified what the characters were going through at the time. in the remake, the music is the same old boring whiney british acoustic pop music that is in every other movie on the planet nowadays. it does absolutely nothing to enhance the viewing experience.  4. \\"we always wear uniforms on uniform day\\", is the warning he gets on his first day of school when he shows up without a uniform on. well did anyone else notice that NO OTHER child in that school that day had a uniform on either?? was that a continuity error or did i miss something?? not to mention that for most of the rest of the movie, after hearing the warning from his teacher, he STILL didn't have a uniform on, though the rest of the kids do, while he looks like he just rolled out of bed and put on a lions shirt. i'm sure this is some lame form of a plot device to make him seem more like an 'outcast' but, come on...  5. the gags in this movie are terrible. as i said earlier, the movie is pretty much shot for shot. and that goes for the dialogue too. during every scene in this movie, i knew exactly what the next line was going to be. now i will say that they changed some of the words but not enough to make it truly different. i would have liked to have seen an entirely new script with the same premise as the original. not the exact same thing with different people reading the same lines. and on a side note to this, they took the immortal line, \\"strike first, strike hard, no mercy\\" and raped it into, \\"no weakness, no pain, no mercy\\". sorry but the new line just seems lame in comparison. you cant change a line like that.  6. another gag was when they changed mr miyagi's 'hand rubbing' healing trick into a sideshow with light bulbs and fire. yeah ok. good one. anchient chinese secret, my tookus!  7. the character of the mother is terrible. in the original she was a loving, caring mom. and a believable one at that. in this movie the character is just a nagging, whiney, mess. she has no real relevance to anything that's happening in the film. she's just there for show.  8. the character of the bad sensei is boring and weak. noone will ever replace martin kove and his menacing stare and powerful voice as the evil teacher of the students. the new version is boring and, though he tries, is without malice. you never really feel THREATENED by him or his actions. he's too suave and quiet spoken to be taken seriously as an adversary. the same can be said for his students. they are never really fleshed out as characters, like in the original. the counterparts to 'dutch', 'bobby', 'tony', etc, are absent. there are boys there occupying those spots but they have very little, if any, dialogue and you cant differentiate one of them from another. they are just filler characters. you dont get to see any of their personalities, or their individual storylines, such as the dissension between them that takes place in the original. or how the 'bobby' character is a bit more emotional than the others.  9. the overall writing of this film is terrible. as i've mentioned before, it's basically the same exact script as before, but with subtle variations. and whatever NEW scenes and lines that they threw in were so poorly written and predictable that you can see them coming from a mile away. the 'puppet show scene' is a great example of this. when dre and his friend go to see a show, who's story is exactly the same as the movie you're watching. the puppets show a story of a girl, or 'princess', who falls for a guy thats 'not worthy' of her because he comes from a different place and her parents dont approve and blah blah blah..... yeah ok.  10. can someone tell me why this kid is always CARRYING a skateboard that he never uses?? i didn't see him ride the thing once in the film, yet he always has it in his hands. is this just some way of making him seem hipor something?   11. \\"MAGIC KUNG FU WATER\\"? really? REALLY?? remember what i said about bad writing? there you go. you're welcome.  12. the 'karate' kid is learning KUNG FU. this is one of the most annoying things about this whole package. i realize that they used the name for recognition and to make more money, but i think a little integrity and continuity would have been better. it should have been called (and was ORIGINALLY TITLED) 'THE KUNG FU KID'. they should have just left it that way.    ok well those are just a few of the problems that this movie has. the lack of any real soul or emotion being the biggest in my eyes. that and the carbon copy thing.    on a positive note, the fight scenes in this movie are really well done, and surprisingly brutal. they were well choreographed and well done.    overall the movie was a bust to me. there's nothing really that keeps you interested at any time. you never remake a classic for a reason. because you will never be able to recreate the magic of these movies. thats why they're classics. can you imagine movies like ROCKY, SCARFACE, DIE HARD, or THE LOST BOYS being remade?? no, me either. they are in a class by themselves. and they should have left this one alone. i can see why those that have never seen the original would like this movie. especially kids, but this is not a movie that i ever plan on watching again. if your kids are looking for a great film and have 'the karate kid' in mind, show them the original. you can never go wrong with that. this new version fails on every level to match the magic of that one.  i had read an earlier review that said that this movie must be good since it made 360 million dollars. yeah well, TWILIGHT makes hundreds of millions too, but that doesn't stop it from sucking (no pun intended) nor does it mean it's a good movie.

0312370849|5.0|I loved  \\"Sarah's Key\\" so much that I finally decided to write my first review on Amazon.    I had this book lying around my house, ignoring it in favor of less somber novels. Well, I finally decided to read it and i finished it pretty quickly, because it's just that gripping. It's not a \\"thriller\\" in the typical sense, with lots of action and violence, but there is plenty of intrigue. \\"Sarah's Key\\" manages to hold the reader's attention throughout, with its poignant intertwining of 1940s Vichy France and modern-day Paris. I wouldn't say this book is absolutely heart wrenching, but I definitely had to wipe tears from my eyes on several occasions.

0451228375|5.0|Im at the beginning of chapter 3, and I have the same feeling that reminded me of why i liked reading The Pillars of The Earth, it's that once you get to a certain point in either book it begins to feel very real, and you find yourself invested in the characters. I'm looking forward to enjoying the rest, the reading is very good for downtime, I'd recommend it to almost anyone, the only thing I'd say is that they both get violent plenty of times, including rape, and there's already been two graphic violence moments in this one. Take Care.
B002R2L008|5.0|I loved all the songs but especially \\"Chasing Pirates\\" and \\"Man of the Hour\\".  All the tunes are Norah Jones classic style, no unpleasant surprises, no need to copy to edit out material that is too loud or different from the rest.  Very easy listening.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|It's disgraceful how the record industry ignored the Ramones to the point that they never had any exposure to speak of on mainstream radio. This album should be taken as a slap in the face to all those pretentious deal makers of the 70's. This band is almost like the Three Stooges in a way--a lifelong career producing authentic relevant material only to be abused by those in power. It's easy to underestimate them at first, but they've got melodies and lyrics that stick and they proved that they had what it took to do over 2000 live concerts in their 21 year career. I'm pissed that I missed them on the first go round because no one played or promoted them; I'm glad that the documentary and this record shows them for what they were--exceptional artists with a phenomenal work ethic.
1439181780|5.0|«Rhonda Byrne's intention is: joy to billions » written just before the last page of the book...Rhonda you succeeded  100% !  Thank you so much Rhonda for bringing that jewel to the attention of Humanity !    That book is as important as the MKS ( Master Key System) written by Charles Haanel nearly one century ago but here written with a sensitive feminine touch...It is the about the law of attraction which is the Power of Love.     Rhonda got it 100% right: everything about the law of attraction is in there:  Some examples:  \\"Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life\\"  \\"Amplify your good feelings by thinking about all the things you love\\"  \\"Life isn't happening to you-life is responding to you\\"  \\"You have to be happy first\\"  \\"You attract the people, events, and circumstances that are on your frequency\\"  \\"Imagine the best and highest\\"  \\"The more love in your field, the more power you have to attract the things you love\\"  \\"All your feelings are degrees of love\\"  \\"If someone has something you want, be as excited as though you have it\\"  \\"Fall in love with life\\"  \\"Every time you feel grateful you are giving love\\"  \\"When anything good happens to you in your day, give thanks\\"  \\"Act if you have it know\\"  \\"Feel love when you pay for anything\\"  \\"You have to be happy to receive the happy versions of other people\\"  \\"Say thank you for your health every single day\\"  \\"All the negative things you see in the world are always, always a lack of love\\"  And that is only a small part of a book one could put besides his bed to read each night.    Of course, many would criticize that book and the law of attraction with a lot of examples like the classic handicapped child and \\"why isn't everyone rich\\" and so on...But a book has to be judged on its effects: what would happen if all would put in practice its advices ? Response: harmony, abundance, peace on Earth...    So that book is important because the only way to bring peace and harmony on our world is by masteringthe law of attraction and Rhonda Byrne did an astounding job to present it in a very attractive and simple way.
B003A4IFGY|2.0|I've followed Tom Petty now for 35 years, and this the worst sounding Heartbreakers album ever.  2010 seems to be a year where Legendary artists want to try something different and fail miserably, (Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Santana and next week Huey Lewis And The News).  I see a lot of reviews saying they were glad Jeff Lynne didn't produce this album, but I sure wish he would have, he knows what's going on behind the board.  The only song that I really truly liked on \\"MOJO\\" was \\"I Should Of Known It\\".  I hope the next release gives us back the real Tom Petty.

In The Doomsday Key, Rollins brings lots of different and seemingly individual elements together in a fast-paced adventure that will leave you reading on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Three bodies are discovered on three continents, all murdered under mysterious circumstances, and all bearing a unique Pagan symbol: a cross within a circle.  Sigma Force are brought in to investigate.  As the facts are discovered, it is revealed that the giant Norwegian corporation Viatus is somehow behind it all, a company that specializes in crop and seed development.  As Pierce and the gang dig deeper, they find themselves involved in an unsolved mystery that goes back thousands a years.  The question is whether they will all be able to stay alive long enough to solve it.<br /><br />Rollins has outdone himself in The Doomsday Key using a variety of historical sources from the Domesday Book, to the Druids and Pagan religion, to the history of Neolithic Britain, to the early days of the Christian church.  Combining these with present day biotechnology and the Doomsday Vault - a real seed vault under heavy protection in the Svalbard archipelago near the North Pole - he skillfully brings it all together in an incredible story that is perfect for readers waiting for the next Dan Brown book.<br /><br />Originally written on May 27th, 2009 ©Alex C.

0439023483|4.0|The Hunger Games is set in a postapocalyptic world in a not too distant and very dismal future. The world is divided into 12 nations and the Capitol. Every year, each nation must send 2 children between the ages of 12 & 18 to the Capitol to fight in the Hunger Games, only one child can survive.     The book is extremely well-written, I couldn't put it down. The characters are believeable and the plot line moves along at a good pace. Given the violence, I was surprized that this book is aimed at children as young as 12. Another mom loaned this book to me and I think children in their late teens would like it, but I would not give it to a 12YO.

0786852550|4.0|The Amulet of Samarkand imagines an Earth where, since the beginning of civilization, Human magicians have summoned spirits from the Other Place as slaves. As such, functional magic takes the place of modern technology in the present day. The tyrannical magicians have always been the ruling class, having learned from an early age how to do things the \\"commoners\\" could never understand. Oh, and it's awesome.<br /><br />Twelve year old Nathaniel is a magician's apprentice in London, capital of the British Empire, when he gets brutally humiliated by the magician Simon Lovelace, his life ruined. Nathaniel then decides to summon the title character, the five thousand and ten year old djinni Bartimaeus, and charges him with the task of stealing the Amulet of Samarkand from Lovelace. But this is Bartimaeus he's dealing with.<br /><br />You'll find many half-baked complaints about The Amulet of Samarkand. Some say that none of the characters are really likable or relatable. Sure, that's true enough, Nathaniel was mercilessly controlling Bartimaeus to get revenge on another magician, and Bartimaeus wanted to get free as soon as possible so as to exact his own vengeance. All the while there were other spirits or magicians or even commoners getting in the way for their own opposing purposes. But how is that a bad thing? What matters is if you're interested in what's going to happen, and I know I was.<br /><br />The book alternates between third-person with Nathaniel and first-person with Bartimaeus. At first, I thought the Nathaniel sections would be a drag, but the boy actually encapsulated my attention. He's a quick learning, calculating, frustrated kid mistreated by his master Underwood. What Lovelace did to Nathaniel was surprisingly tragic, and I could relate to the little ankle-biter.<br /><br />Now, I don't usually like first-person. It is often done with a flat character that makes me feel like I'm talking to a very stupid version of myself. But this was far, far from the case when it came to Bartimaeus, who is one of the greatest characters I have ever come across. His narration caught me off guard in the first chapter and I had to stop and laugh out loud. No really. The footnotes that Bartimaeus often puts at the bottom of the page to offer some humor and explain the alternate world the story takes place in information. While snide and loathing, he is also a very obviously weary being. Having dealt with magicians for thousands of years, he now hates them and successfully stereotypes them. If he ever had any hopes for one, he has no certainly given up on any sort of future. He has always been a slave, and he sure he will continue to be one. All he can do in poke fun at his situation. His ancient memories result in some truly interesting thoughts, like his references to his times in Egypt and his relationship with Ptolemy.<br /><br />People have complained about the footnotes too, saying that they are too confusing and distracting. Remember then, that this book is for an older audience, and also that the footnotes are integral to the book and Bartimaeus's character. This brings me to another point: the fictional world. Jonathan Stroud's world is basically just like ours, but with one key difference: there is magic. His take on the spirits is logical and practically sci-fi, and his world-building is rigorous and internally consistent. Everything is extremely believable, and a lot of the fictional world is based on Arabic folklore. With the magician's rule comes themes about the Human condition and governmental corruption. The magicians' oligarchy is really only a system that is there to benefit the people who found themselves within its order. The novel raises a lot of moral questions that I think it intentionally doesn't answer.<br /><br />So there you have it, like I said, The Bartimaeus Trilogy: The Amulet of Samarkand is one of the best novels I've ever read. I was only slightly interested in it when I heard about it, but I'mglad I bought it. It was an awesome read and I urge you to check it out if you're intrigued in any way, shape, or form.<br />9 out of  10glad I bought it.

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|my only comment in response to all the previous ones is that this series should only be watched after reading the books from which the miniseries was taken. Eugene Sledge's book-With the Old Breed, Robert Leckie's-Helmet for my Pillow, and R.V.Burgin's-Islands of the Damned, to name a few. With the insight from these books the viewer is much better prepared and the seeming discontinuities are much less noticable. With this said, I don't feel they did the stories true justice. The battle scenes were good but the characters were not quite like the real life characters who lived these horrific moments. I say again...read the books.
0451457994|2.0|I didn't love 2001: A Space Odyssey, but space travel in general doesn't really do it for me. The original concept, taking into account when it was written and how far we've come since then, is well beyond anything conceivable and I believe that is one of the main reasons this book is so highly regarded.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book is all concept. The pacing is slow and the story drags for the majority of the book. What should have been terrifying never really effected me as it should have. The characters were hard to become emotionally attached to and most of the time I found myself rooting for the \\"villain\\" to win so the book would come to an end. Even the actual ending of the book felt like a disappointment.<br /><br />2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic science fiction novel and hugely loved by most. While I can see why it's been enjoyed by the masses, I just couldn't garner the enthusiasm others have had. I appreciate how imaginative and unique the book would have been considered in the sixties, but given a first time reading in the present day, it failed to impress me.
B0047SF41G|4.0|I was so impressed with the first hour of the film that was ready to give it 5 stars. Unfortunately, the movie falls into the same trap most other action thrillers do -- that is there's so much focus on creating yet another  gore scene that the story must degrade at all cost to support that fetish.<br /><br />In its first 65 minutes, this movie did a fair job of character development while keeping it interesting, mysterious, somewhat logical, good Special Effects, good humor injections at appropriate times, good soundtrack, good acting/directing, sufficient action, and thank God none of that stomach turning, teenager pleasing shaky camera! All that convinced this viewer that the film was going to evolve and climax into some brainy twist (or an intelligently executed scape plan) for the ending. But no... All that changed when it suddenly shifted gears to follow that old tired video gamish shoot-them-up mindless action.<br /><br />Hopefully, the sequel (which it seems to imply there's one) will undo some of the shortcommings -- but how often do we get that from Hollywood?
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Love the show, and I have every DVD of the series.  I guess you could call me a Grey's addict..  LOL  If you too are totally into the show, then get this DVD, (as well as the others).  You will not be sorry.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|the reviewer for amazon is an idiot,the hole point of the movie was to turn the viewer into an avatar with its use of 3D,AND INVOLVE YOU IN THE MOVIE LIKE AS IF YOU WERE ON PANDORA WITH THEM TO FEEL WHAT THE CHARACTERS FEEL,AND HE ACHIEVED THIS TO THE TUNE OF 2.7 BILLION $$$$BY THE WAY THE STORY AND CHARACTERS WERE AWESOME AND THEIR WORDS SEEMED RIGHT TO ME,WHAT IS EVERYBODY SUPPOSED TO QUOTE SHAKESPEARE IN THEIR MOVIES IDIOT ....THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO HATE BECAUSE THEY ARE JEALOUS...ROBERT HORTON...AVATAR IS GREAT YOU AIN`T!!!REALLY, WHO ARE WE GOING TO TRUST A MOVIE CRITIC?WHICH IS PROBABLY A FAILED ACTOR OR SCREEN WRITER,OR FILM SCHOOL DROPOUT,OR JAMES CAMERON!!!JUST LOOK AT HIS TRACK RECORD IT SPEAKS FOR ITS SELF!!!
0345505387|1.0|I love Diana Gabaldon books.  The detail in her books make them come alive.  I was really excited when I saw she had another book and that it was based on Jamie's viewpoint.  Then I saw that it was a \\"Graphic Novel\\".  I wasn't sure if it was my thing or not but I really enjoyed the stories I wanted any missing information in the story so I ordered it.  I was truly disappointed.  It was difficult for me to keep focused and I didn't even finish it.  I got midway through and couldn't figure out who was talking and bored out of mind.  I will wait until she brings out her next book in the Outlander Series and hopefully there won't be anymore that are Graphic Novels.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|These films are absolutely fabulous.  If you are reading this then I am sure you already know this, so I am not going to spend any time on going into that.  What I would like to comment on is the artistic process that went into this film and some people's dislike of it on here.    Reading through the comments here I noticed that many of the three star reviews and less complain about it being too grainy and that they \\"upscaled\\" it to 1080p and that even 2001 looks better on Blu-Ray.  Worst of all are the people that complain about the yellowish/orangish hue in the first movie and that they are dark.  These people really don't know anything about the technology and as a result their comments are meaningless.  First of all; the films were shot dark on purpose.  That was an artistic choice, and I think it helps make it feel more like America in the 1940s.  Then there are those that say that video was upscaled because it's a 70's film and that 2001 looks better.  This is laughable.  How can these people call themselves fans of film, but yet know nothing about the technology. All three of the Godfather movies are shot on 35mm film.  Modern movies that aren't shot digitally are usually shot on 35mm film. (it's the standard) 2001 was shot on 70mm film hence.  This allows for a higher resolution when transferring to digital.  The reason the first film looks so grainy is because they made so many copies from the original negatives, that they were destroyed. They had to do a world wide search to find the very best negatives to make a new master with.  All of which were copies from the original. That's why some parts look better than others.  It's what they had to work with.  The yellowish/orangish hue was done on purpose in post production as an artistic choice.     I am sure even with all this said people will still complain and would prefer that they have a a very sterile, grainless, perfect color balance digital feel that digital cameras can give.  I for one prefer film forthe master.  It looks far better in my opinion and gives films their own unique feel.  This is something I feel with be lost when everything eventually goes digital and the digital post production will look faked.      To sum everything up; If you are a film fan, these are a must have in your collection.  The restoration in every detail is as good as it's going to get with what was available.  Even the soundtrack is as equally amazing in restoration as the video is.  Enjoy it in all it's greatness.

B002JVWQSW|2.0|Disappointed.  Other comedies are better.  Should not have won the Emmy for Best Comedy in my opinion.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Read all 4 books. Favorite Twilight & Eclipse.  Twilight was a total disappointment. Screenwriter & director totally ruined it.  Did not translate to screen at all. The only thing it had going for it was Rob Pattinson. Very easy on the eyes.  New Moon! Thought it was Taylor's movie. Again Edward & Bella's love story not well translated on screen. Weitz gave us Zombie Edward & Bella.  Better special effects & cinematography though.  Sreenwriter is still a problem. Eclipse!  Definitely better than the previous two. Fast paced, more action, more  romance.  However, they tried to pack lots of stuff in and missed the most important parts. (From the moment the first film hit it big the focus has been on making the films more male-friendly.)  Fave scenes the sleep-over-from the time he met her at her truck to the leg-hitched.  Oh if only they got that part right! The tent scenes was ok.  Edward's reaction to Bella's cheating on him with jacob-beautiful in the book,ruined in Eclipse.  Things really got worse with that silly speech by Bella at the end \\"it's not about you Edward\\"  Seriously what was that screenwriter reading.?  After three books it wasn't about Edward at all. OMG! The chemistry and passion in the book is jut not there on screen.  When it's all said and done it is the love story of Edward and Bella, and boy I hope we finally get that story in  BD. Won't hold my breath.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Hilarious - haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  Witty smart writing! Great acting!
B00003CXCW|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this for the very first time at a free screening at Pershing Square in Downtown Los Angeles, and even though we were a few miles from Sunset Boulevard I still can't think of a better place to have your eyeballs permanently branded by the sight of MISS Gloria Swanson, THE camp Queen of the Highest Order, sliding down that staircase for her final \\"close up\\". She is fantastic, mad fun in this film, and you will laugh uproariously at some of her lines- \\"I have oil fields in Bakersfield Pumping PUMPING PUMPING!\\" was one that i cannot write without laughing. And what a great sport she was- this former silent film queen who had seen her popularity diminish, Norma Desmond style, after the advent of talkies- and far from denying the fact she reveled in it and even poked fun at herself with this, her most famous role. And pay attention to her physicality in this- as a former silent star, she understood better than anyone how to gesticulate, to use your face and your hands, and her every gesture is dripping with gaudy grandness. The pictures may have gotten smaller, darling, but she who laughs last, laughs hardest. I treasure the very moment this film entered my life, frankly, and I insist! that you must! see it!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Now I know why Jim Parsons won the Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy.  He is great!
B0017V7GTY|5.0|The '59 Sound kicks off with the exhilarating 1-2 adrenaline blast of \\"Great Expectations\\" (complete with an opening needle drop on an old soul record) and \\"The 59 Sound\\" that doesn't let up until the wistful valentine regrets to old lovers of \\"Here's Looking at You, Kid\\" . The Springsteen comparisons are inevitable and many lyrics are outright homage, but that should induce you to seek this out because these guys masterfully crib Springsteen's passion and exuberance in a joyful punk soul package. This is a record that seems to have ignored most of the pop culture of the last 40 years, but yet feels so fresh and invigorating, it sounds like a timeless intersection of Sam Cooke and The Clash on the radio.
0811876373|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to arrive and I wasn't disappointed! The cake pop ideas are very cute! And it is quite easy to follow. I would have liked a few more pictures in it though, all in all a very cute book!

0312323867|4.0|Although I was not a fan of the plot line covered in Giffin's first book, Something Blue, I did enjoy her writing style and ability to tell an intriguing story.<br /><br />Something Blue is the continuation of Something Borrowed, but from the perspective of Darcy Rhone who was a secondary character in the first novel. I was skeptical as to whether I would want to read about Darcy since she is portrayed as vain and materialistic. But as the story unfolds, Darcy moves to the UK, makes new friends, and slowly realizes that things she placed importance on weren't important at all.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading other novels by Giffin.
0385342047|3.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's novels. I'm not sure if it's because I'm getting older or the shopaholic series is getting tired, but a major portion of this novel is the same old material from previous shopaholic books. I did not enjoy reading about some of the main character, Becky Brandon's struggles because they were the SAME struggles from all the other shopaholic books. Doesn't Becky eventually have to grow up or grow out of the excessive materialistic/shopping frenzy habits that get her into trouble??<br /><br />Despite my aversion to reading repetitive material, I did highly enjoy the wacky antics of Becky's daughter Minnie, who is a bratty, spoiled, chip-off-the-block of her mother. The book is readable simply for the highlights of reading about Minnie's hissy fits.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, I'd recommend reading Mini Shopaholic, but go into it knowing that you have already read a good portion of the book in Kinsella's earlier Shopaholic books.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Don't let the recent -- and rather silly/self-important -- controversy (NON-controversy???) about that \\"GQ\\" magazine article featuring some of the \\"Glee\\" cast in rather provocative poses distract you from the fact that this FOX musical-dramedy is easily one of the most consistently inventive, moving, daring and entertaining TV shows in many, many years!!    As with FOX's similarly-inventive and whip-smart \\"House\\" series, \\"Glee\\" is one of those shows where you often find yourself crying through your laughter and laughing through your tears -- and this terrific season 1 DVD compilation is proof-positive that \\"Glee\\" definitely deserved all 21 of its whopping Emmy nominations (although how the incredibly talented Amber Riley WASN'T one of those nominees is totally beyond me; that jaw-droppingly superb rendition Riley did last year of that Jennifer Husdson song from \\"Dreamgirls\\" MORE than justified an Emmy nom. all by itself!!!!)

B002SF9YUM|4.0|This was a movie that I had to watch twice to get the  gist of what was really going on in the time period.  I wasn't all that familiar with the revolution that was  going on in Spain, and the personal freedoms that were  soon to end, to the \\"free thinkers\\" artists, writers of   that time. Javier Beltran, Rob Pattinson, and Matthew  McNulty, are excellent as Federico Lorca, Salvador Dali,  and Luis Bunuel.The three become friends at the famous  Madrid School of Fine Arts.  There they challenge their  respective art worlds with new ideas, pushing the  envelope with their work, mixed with forbidden attractions  that will determine what the future will be for them,  and how they will be remembered. Don't pass this by, it  is well scripted and very well acted.
0887431461|5.0|This workbook was great for my 5 year old daughter.  We started it the summer before she started Kindergarten.  She enjoyed it so much.  She always wanted to keep working on it.  School Zone creates great educational and fun workbooks for children and my children have completed many of them. THey have a great selection.  The Big Kindergarten workbook was worth it.  It really helped prepare my daughter for Kindergarten and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The final credits come up and my immediate reaction is \\"Is that it?\\"  The concept behind the movie is solid...a monster hits NY but rather than show it from the perspective of the laser-gun wielding hero, show how regular folks are affected by the unknown as events unfold.  Unfortunately the \\"regular folks\\" are terrible.  The movie starts off attempting to establish the characters but alas the characters come across as being one dimensional, for whom I have very little, if any, empathy for.  The dialogue from the camera operator becomes annoying.  And as each character dies there is a pervading sense of \\"oh well, no great loss there\\".  Quite simply - the concept behind the movie is superb, alas the execution is utterly flawed, and to sum up my impression of the film then it would be \\"Terrible\\". If you want a similar theme but excellently done then give [Rec] a look over.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is a wonderful film on several levels.  It is a fine science fiction film.  It's a great action film.  Awe inspiring special effects.  But the part of the film I was especially interested in is the questioning of reality.  Of course the cosmos is made up of matter and energy, true reality.  But what humans know of as reality is our state of consciousness. And our conscience is not merely a recording of the matter and energy we can perceive.  Our conscious can make things up.  And made up stuff is part of our reality.  What is real?  Is it just what we can perceive or does it include what we create, what we dream?  Is consciousness always a dream, even when we are awake?  The point is our whole universe is really, really in our mind.  Our consciousness is all we know, all we can know.
0753519550|5.0|You will not be disappointed.  Branson's story is one that reads better than fiction.  He is truly a larger than life personality with lessons for everyone -- especially those in business and those charged with innovation and creating the new.  This guy is the real thing and one that we will look back to for generations as truly an original.  He is the Howard Hughes of our time.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I think this is an excellent, if not close to perfect, second installment in the series. We are now drawn deeper into some of the characters, \\"warts and all\\" as they say. A big part of the Iron Man story is that of redemption; not just physical redemption from the terrorists in the first movie, but the emotional and spiritual redemption from the many vices of Tony Stark. If these aspects of Stark are only given a surface treatment, there's no idea of why Tony is driven to continue to be Iron Man. The ghost of his father, the demon in the bottle, and the self-destructive behaviors all drive Tony to a need for redemption and salvation.<br /><br />True, this isn't a solid, start-to-end, nothing-but-explosions action movie. There is actually some character development and interpersonal relationship development (Tony-Pepper, Tony-Rhodes, Tony-Fury, etc.) that all tie together the motivations behind Tony Stark/Iron Man. Without this, the character makes no sense.<br /><br />But, there is plenty of action. The final battle probably has more action than most action movies, it's just packed into the last 1/4 of the film instead of spread out here and there.<br /><br />I think this movie seems more real, as well. People seem to be searching for words, people talk over each other instead of waiting until A is done before B starts to talk.<br /><br />The additional material would be worth the price alone. There are hours of stuff to watch, and I haven't gotten through all of it yet. It's nice that instead of just Iron Man, a large part of the Marvel universe is explored and shown how it ties together.<br /><br />I can't think of a single reason not to recommend this Blu-ray/DVD/digital combo set...there is something here for everyone.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I think the people who gave this book bad ratings never made it past the first 30-40%. I'll admit I wasn't exactly loving the book at first. The book follows 2 different characters Mikael and Lisbeth. Mikaels part is very boring for the first 40% or so, but Lisbeth is incredibly interesting throughout the whole book. This book just grows on you more and more the further you get. As with all really popular books (or anything popular really) there are going to be quite a few people disappointed with it but don't let that stop you from reading an incredible book.
0061922315|5.0|as a woman who suffered the heartache of infertility, this book shows great understanding of my frustration and grief. as an adoptive mother of two, the author also firmly grasps the love that is forever and unconditional on all sides of the adoption triangle.  we have open domestic adoptions, so our children know their birthmothers and feel their constant love.  they also feel the love i share with them each day that pours out like water from my soul.  this love could be no deeper if they had been created within my body.  love knows no boundaries.  family can take on the most unexpected shape.  thank you, lovely ms. gowda for writing such a meaningful, passionate, and beautiful book that sheds light on the global experience of motherhood.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Overall it is a decent workout if you are short on time. You sweat enough that you actually feel like you have done something. Some moves are easier than others, and I basically just do the level 3 workout, because I really did not like some of the routines in Level 2, and Level 1 got too easy.    I would like to give it 4 stars because I do feel it the next day despite it being a short workout (with warm up and cool down it actually amounts to about 28 minutes). However I have a few complaints that really keeps me from doing this video more times than not.    First off you cannot fast foward through a lot of the DVD. Therefore if you ever turn your DVD player off or switch DVD's you have to listen to her entire spiel again and again. Second, and probably the biggest complaint of all is that she NEVER shuts up. And all she is doing is repeating her same corny mantras (\\"Dont phone it in at the gym\\" etc.) or she keeps telling me to not give up because \\"this is when the magic happens\\". Half the time I don't have any urge to give up, but am tempted to just so I don't have to listen to her anymore. It's constant. Plus the names she gives certain moves are corny too. I have tried muting it and putting my own music on but it doesn't work because a lot of the time your not facing the tv and have to figure out when they are done through listening.    She seriously acts like she is the baddest trainer out there and that the work out is so killer and it gets irritating. The workout isn't easy, but it isn't incredibly hard either. Plus I really get some weird creepy vibes off of her when she deals with the other girls. If that was a guy teaching and he lingered and touched their stomachs like she does he would look like a total perv.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|Russel Crow did a fantastic job as Robin Longstride, better know as Robin of the Hood, Cate Blanchett was a superb Lady Marion Loxley, Mark Strong did great playing the villian Sir Godfrey. Ridley Scott directed an amazing visualization of the 13th century in how France tried to take over England, and the only thing that was in their wau Robin Hood and his crusade. The story tells about how Robin Hood became an outlaw thanks to the jealous King John. The movie is not about Robin already being an outlaw. The movie does have its slow parts, but the endng battle scene between the English and the French was outstanding. Great cast, directing, visualiztion, overall, a great movie.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Purchased them for playing music only. I will not use a mic or making a calls on Skype or so on. I could not found anything that came close for the price and what can do. I walk around the house and went outside with them and they continue playing with out any problem. I like the 7.1 it sounds better then just 2 channels. Plus I can control the play, pause, Skip Forward, Skip Back right from the headset.<br /><br />So the bottom conclusion is.....<br /><br />I like those headset. It works like it said, Great sound, Good mic, Good range. (I got at 60 ft. Going true one wall before signal lost. And then to recover signal I had to get to about 30 ft.)<br /><br />But they are Not that comfortable like others said. I have a small head and wear glasses they don't feel that good. They are kind of heavy and every time I move my head they are moving a little and they produce a rubbing noise That I can hear. I try Boss over the ear and they were just perfect no noise but they are wired......<br /><br />Would I purchased them again?<br /> At this time the answer is Yes......
B0013FXWU6|2.0|This movie was long and boring. If you need to take go to sleep, but cant, pop this movie in and you'll be asleep in a matter of minutes. Daniel Day - Lewis did a great job playing the independent oilman Daniel Plainview, but he turns into a prick by the end of the movie. Movie was out there, I cant say that this was a masterpiece at all. I wanted more out of them welling for oil then what I got. I must say that the fire incident was pretty cool, even though it left his son, H.W. deaf. Overall, not a good movie.
1402210086|5.0|REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I couldn't decide between 4 and 5 stars, but I rounded to 5 because I continued thinking about it afterwards and am glad I read it.<br /><br />This was written more than 50 years ago and is dated in some ways.  It's an example of a wonderful variety of characters whose \\"natures\\" create romantic conflicts.  It's a nice change of pace from the typical popular character types in most romances written today.  It's also a welcome change from the typical good-guy-bad-guy plots.  I can see how Heyer became famous, and I think this would be a good novel to start with if you haven't read any of her.  The British dialogue may be a little hard to understand, but you can get used to it.  I liked this as an audiobook.  I'm not sure how I would feel reading it in paperback.  Because I was doing the audiobook, I found it helpful to print the list of characters from the website heyerlist org under Who's Who.  The ending was great.  I loved the secondary story about Lord Dolphinton.<br /><br />COMMENTS FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:<br />The following Goodreads reviewers said some excellent things worth repeating.  Thanks guys.<br /><br />Abigail A<br />(source of my title above - she sums it up well)<br /><br />Katharine<br />\\"The heroine is (typically for Heyer) impulsive and a bit strong-minded and clueless at the same time, but somehow manages to be wholy charming instead of obnoxious.\\"<br /><br />-inbetween_<br />\\"My eyes did sting at that one line, though: \\"What I mean is, like you to have everything you want. Wished it was me, that's all.\\"\\"<br /><br />Dlora<br />\\"I just finished Cotillion and was enchanted with it. I'm always intrigued with the titles of a book and I had wondered why Heyer had chose cotillion for this novel. As I recall, a cotillion is a formal ball and almost at the end of the novel I realized that the characters were dancing around each other, coming together and moving apart, just like a dance. I loved it. The main dancers are Kitty Charing and her \\"cousins\\" who are dancing to the tune of their rich irascible uncle who will leave his fortune to Kitty if she marries one of his grandnephews.\\"<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Kitty's parents died.  Matthew Penicuik was a friend of her father's and became her guardian.  He is gout ridden, irascible and sharp tongued.  His relatives rarely visit.  He's wealthy but rarely spends money on Kitty.  He won't let her travel to London or have pretty clothes.  The story begins when Matthew announces that he will leave his entire fortune to Kitty if she marries one of his five great nephews.  If she does not, his fortune will go to charity.  Kitty apparently does not want to marry any of his great nephews.  She wants to go to London to search for a job as a governess and maybe meet someone she could fall in love with and marry.  Also she would like to have a few weeks of fun in London, something Matthew would never allow.  Freddy is one of the nephews.  He is wealthy and into clothes.  He's not the scholarly type, but he has practical knowledge.  He's the good friend type.  Kitty asks him to help her with a favor.  She wants to pretend they are engaged and that Freddy needs to take her to London to spend time with his parents.  Freddy is reluctant at first, but he agrees.  Matthew then reluctantly allows Kitty to go to London and gives her a small amount of money to spend on bridal clothes.  They come up with a reason as to why they are delaying making a public announcement of their engagement.<br /><br />Kitty sees the best in people.

030745455X|4.0|This is a very good follow-up to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Larsson was able, again, to strengthen a traditional mystery novel with a set of non-linear and very human characters. This is what makes his work truly distinctive. Anyone who likes mystery novels will enjoy this book, specially those who read the first one of the series.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|Non-Spoiler: The book is written from many different POV, and the author masterfully transitions between these and between time periods of the plot line in such a way that you never lose sight of what is going on in the present.          Spoilers ahead: The reunion of Campbell and Julia is kind of boring. I know they are characters in a minor plot line, but it would have been more interesting and less mushy to have them hook up later in the book.    The ending: I keep seeing reviews that are outraged at the end of the book. I think the book ended brilliantly: the book is about a girl who defines herself by (and SOLELY by) her sister. She mentions her beginnings, her conception in a petri dish, and it is obvious that Anna knows that the meaning of her existence was for the benefit of her sister alone. Yes, she loves her parents, and YES her parents love her, but, Anna was brought to life for a very specific purpose; to donate to her sister. Until she becomes emancipated from her parents, Anna defines herself as such. It is kind of fitting at the end that Anna dies once that meaning for existence is exhausted. She doubts herself as having much a future (as shown when she questions Campbell about his praise of her), and isn't sure what she'll do when it is all over. As it turns out, she doesn't have to worry about that. I think that while Anna and her sister love each other and get along as well as close siblings are able, she is a depressed individual. If Anna had lived and not donated a kidney to her sister, Kate would have died, Sara and Brian would have blamed her deep inside resenting the hell out of their daughter, and her brother Jesse would have disappeared between the cracks. The way the book ended, Kate lives, Sara and Brian are depressed over the loss of their daughter, but they have a miracle child who should have died, and Jesse is still at home with them and not in jail, the path he would have gone down.    I really enjoyed this book, and I will say thatI like the theatrical version as well. In the theatrical version Kate is not happy to die, but she is content with dying as long as her family comes to terms with it as she has. In this version Kate is happy to live on and do the things that she encouraged for her sister. This book DOES have a happy ending, it's just not THE happy ending that so many people were hoping for.

B0001DMPVI|5.0|I've had an import CD of this album for a few years now, and it's still great to be able to hear it without all the pops and scratches my 22-year-old vinyl recod has.  Another writer noted the absence of the tremelo-reverb missing from one of Burden's lines.  Well, I can forgive that absence on the cd, because the clarity and quality of the remix for the cd makes up for the oversight.  I was up in Great Lakes Naval Training Base when this record came out, and guys used to try to play the grooves off the 45 of \\"Sky Pilot\\" in the juke box at the Canteen.  When I got the record, I was blown away by the Animals' use of the not-so-well-known electic sitar and the 12-string acoustic guitar.  Back then for me to hear them both on one record turned my brain to mush, it was so - so - ahh, I think you get the idea.  This was a concept album, one of the premier ones at that.  I enjoy all the songs, even the two that Burden didn't sing.  I still put it on now and then.  Five stars for the nostalgea factor, for the improved audio on the cd and for the album being ahead of its time.  Oh, yeah, wanna hear something funny?  On the list of tacks on the back, track five is listed as \\"Orange and Red Beans\\" < NOT a typo!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Great flick that tells the story of the birth of Facebook in 2003. The film was spot-on in its depiction of the Harvard campus and the nasty, ultra-competitiveness that exemplifies some of its alums. The film also gave us a very disturbing and very believable Mark Zuckerberg, the giga-nerd who used people like pawns in his little game of self-advancement. Justin Timberlake nearly stole the show with his roue take on Napster founder Sean Parker. Who knows whether drugging and underage sex were as big with him as the film showed. But the combination of the pale, anti-social Zuckerman and Parker, the socially-connected party boy, were critical in giving us Facebook, that coolect and nicest of ways to meet people online.
0316017922|4.0|So, you thought highly successful people came prepackaged that way? Well, Gladwell disagrees. He provides winning arguments in favor of hard work and perseverance among other intangibles as a direct path to success. His \\"10,000 hour rule\\" may not be totally watertight but it does provide a deep insight into his thesis. Also, his star-studded examples are entertaining to say the least, making the book hard to put down.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|I can't think of any movie cliches that were left out of this sprawling mess. There's: save the farm; the unlikely match between a sophisticated lady and rough-hewn hunk; barroom brawl; racial integration; little guy vs big conglomerate; Aboriginal wizardry; a coming-of age story, a cute orphan, and a big cattle drive.<br /><br />That's before the Japs start bombing everything, turning this into a war movie, with an escape, the possible death of a main character and just desserts for the bad guy.<br /><br />This movie should have ended at least twice before it did, but dragged on interminably until every last damned plot thread was tied up and glued into place. Tedious and unbelievable. Plus, the CG work showed and the bonus material consisted of two deleted scenes. Rubbish.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|It was different from what one would expect from a Robin Hood movie.  It was the events that lead up to him becoming an outlaw.

0307454541|4.0|A fast-paced novel with a unique heroine who will appeal to many women.  It was time for a new thriller series with an atypical protaganist and Steig Larsson gave us an unforgettable one: A tough, take-no-prisoners, punker investigator whose tough exterior hides many secrets and insecurities. Too bad Larsson left us before he could complete the series.  The characters are credible and deserving of your time. If you like the book, I would commend to you the DVD film version with subtitles. They stick to the story line.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Satellite 15 -       (6)    OK for about 2 min.  Final Frontier -     (8)    El Dorado -          (8)    Ooooooooooh barracuda! Great chorus and guitar solos.  Mother of Mercy -   (8.5)   Similar theme to \\"For the greater good of god.\\"  Coming Home -       (8.5)   Slower, very well done, solo at 3:30 very nice.  Alchemist -         (10)    Written by Gers - people knock him for his solos but this song is GREAT! Fast and heavy.  Isle of Avalon -    (5)&(10)  Between 3:50 and 5:30 it's a 10+. Awesome guitar solos. You can hear a bell in the background while the guitars play-very cool. The rest of the song is average.  Starblind -          (10)   5:05 to 5:40 best part of song.  Talisman -           (10)   Gers again. Try listening to the chorus without raising your fist in the air!  The Man Who Would Be King     (7)  When The Wild Wind Blows     (9.5)  From 6:45 on I just love the melody.      Smith and Harris dominate the songwriting with Gers having the best 2 songs. kind of sounds like a mix of MOLAD, 7th Son, and Caught Somewhere in Time. I love the cover - very creative work by Mark Wilkinson, and the sketches inside the CD book. There is one with Eddie and an alien female with what looks like their offspring, and the baby looks like whats on the cover- Eddie's son!
B000001FS3|5.0|I think this is one of the best rock albums of all time. Amazing how U2 keeps going with the hits, but this remains their best.
B003WTE886|5.0|First of all, I will admit that I was not a big fan of Taylor Swift before I listened to this album.  I would confess that she is a decent songwriter and a decent singer.  My complaint was that she lacked originality.      However, her songs were always so damn catchy!  Every once in a while, there would be a song or two from her that I just couldn't get out of my head.  This album made me respect her on a whole new level.  Almost every song on here could be a radio hit, and the lyrics show incredible growth in maturity.    Many tracks are reminiscent of songs on her first two albums.  \\"Mine\\" is particularly strong in it's poppy, giddy goodness.  Also, \\"Enchanted\\" is very unique and \\"Sparks Fly\\" has an irresistible chorus.    The most impressive tracks on the album, however, show signs of Swift's maturing as an artist vocally and as a songwriter.  \\"Dear John\\" and \\"Back to December\\" both bear ghosts of Swift's love life and are hauntingly emotive.  \\"Never Grow Up\\" is a gorgeous track that brings nostalgic feelings with it, and \\"Innocent\\" is deeply reflective and carries wisdom.  Her words are carefully chosen.    The album is not perfect however.  Some of the weaker tracks, such as \\"Mean\\", \\"Speak Now\\", and \\"Long Live\\" show a lack of artistic ingenuity that Swift has worked so hard to develop on this album.    Overall, \\"Speak Now\\" is a CD that won't leave your iPod for a long time.  You'll be humming the tracks in your sleep.  Bravo!  Color me impressed.    5/5 Stars, and probably the best album I've heard this year.
B003AMAOW4|3.0|Nikolaus Lehnhoff is a producer/designer/director whose work has been familiar to me for decades.  He has moved from early, beautiful scene settings and vivid directing in to pure Regie re-interpretation of the stories of the operas.    He broke off into this post-industrial, retro-fascist-bashing phase in the late 1980s with his Ring cycle in Munich, brilliantly cast and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.  This performance is available inexpensively on EMI.  No libretto but it's a keeper in my collection.  I think there is probably a film of this show out there in Europe but not in America.  This is not a problem for me because Lehnhoff's shows are not visual experiences I much care for.    This Lohengrin from Baden-Baden was a 'risk' buy for me.  I wanted to hear the remarkable Klaus Florian Vogt's Lohengrin and see Waltraud Meier's Ortrud.  I also wanted to know what kind of Wagner conductor we have in Kent Nagano.  The answer is:  excellent.      I enjoyed this film in spite of the Nazi overtones, overtones that have become very hackneyed and boring in the hands of the Regie-maniacs.  I like non-horns-cuirass and bear-fur Wagner productions.  The flawed execution of Chéreau's fascinating Ring at Bayreuth in 1976-81 was beautiful and not at all controversial now as it was at its notorious premiere.    Lehnhoff's sets are not especially annoying as they are so bland, and his micro-managing of the actor's produces fine results.  Best of all the singers are mostly excellent.  None of them sing less than well and one of them, Vogt, seems ideal as the ephemeral white knight, slightly robotic and inhuman, as Lehnhoff sees him) but an angel when it comes to beautiful lyric singing, and he never shows a single dot of strain or fatigue in this very challenging role.    Solveig Kringelborn's voice is slightly hard and vinegary but she is capable of beautiful soft singing on top, and she is an excellent actress.  When it comes to acting, though, it is Waltraud Meier's riveting, intense work as Ortrud who steals the show.  Meier is a phenomenal stage creature.  She is made to wear some outlandish feathers and slinky gowns but she is beautiful and physically gracious and triumphs over the obstacles set before her by the production team.  A very great filmed operatic performance.    Tom Fox is a handsome fit neurotic in the American vein and he has a strong virile baritone of great power and volume.  He too is a fine actor and keeps up with the high standards set by Meier's Ortrud.  Roman Trekel has never been what I'd call a top-drawer voice and his acting is very stiff and self-conscious.  But he sings well enough as the Herald and the dull grey suit he wears like a straight-jacket is apt for his impersonation.      Hans-Peter König is better cast here as the avuncular king than he was as Hagen and Fafner in Thielemann's recent production at Bayreuth.  König's voice falls into the category of beautiful bass but not with the black basses we associate with the darker Wagner bass roles, like Kurt Böhme and Matti Salminen.  König would probably make a great King Mark in Tristan.    All told, the monolithic wall and great stairway in Act I do not distract or enrage.  It is a neutral set which is fine in a Regie production.  Lehnhoff never gets in your face like, say, Calixto Beito or Peter Konwitschny.  Act 2 is the same set, ostensibly.  The Bridal Chamber in Scene One of Act Three is a bridal chamber that looks like a bridal chamber, which is nice because it could have looked like Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory with Kringelborn looking more like Elsa Lanchester than Elsa von Brabant.  Lehnhoff's direction of the singers is at its peak in this scene.  Kringelborn's Elsa really weedles Lohengrin into annoyance and she reveals herself, now that she's got her man, as a manipulative shrew who will not let it rest until she has dug out all his secrets, rather like Judith in Bluebeard's Castle.  I liked the comical touch in this scene of having Lohengrin playing bits on a white grand piano which is a reverse piano, high notes on the left, bass notes on the right hand.  And Vogt clearly has excellent facility playing the piano, which helps.  He is entirely convincing as this strange arch-angel come to earth, and he's good-looking to boot.  Scene Two is all the more poignant for her depressed regret at her truculence at not obeying Lohengrin's warnings about prying.      The orchestra plays beautifully and Nagano has a fine regard for the more delicate aspects of this beautiful score.  He doesn't drown the singers in the big parts and his tempo choices are perfection, under the circumstances.    So why only 3 stars.  Well, I'd give it four if the singing was a notch up.  Aside from Vogt, none of the singing could be considered Great.  Meier's voice has heard better days, it's vinegary now but not unpleasant at all and her top notes ring out fully in this role, as compared to her Isolde where her top notes are strangulated more often than not.  But then there is her superb acting ability to carry her into greatness.      Added to this is the basic drabness and nihilistic aspect of Lehnhoff's vision.  He is always nihilistic these days and that too has become a cliché in Euro opera productions of this type.  Fascist military overtones pervade the entire production (meh). It really is about time we move on from that as it has been way overdone in the past 30 years and it's time for a new tack in Wagner opera production    But I prefer this kind of neutral politicized setting to the Richard Jones complete re-interpretation in Nagano's other filmed performance of this opera done in Munich with Jonas Kaufmann and Anja Harteros.  I love both those singers and would like to have them, especially together, in these roles.  But I haven't yet be able to justify the silliness of the photographs I've seen of this show and the sense that I wouldn't want to watch it more than once or twice.  I liked Richard Joneses Ring at Covent Garden in 1994 but that was a more humorous mythology (Fricka's beard!) than a political tract.  But Jones has gone full-regie in the Munich Lohengrin and I view this with a very jaundiced eye and haven't popped for the dvd.. yet.  The jury is still out.     This Baden-Baden show is recommendable if you have some discretionary play money, love Lohengrin and are open to non-traditional productions that won't piss you off.
B003YOZNBK|1.0|Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, The only redeeming factor is Megan Fox in a corset... and thats not even a great reason to watch this movie.

0765328321|5.0|Eric Nylund's 2001 release of Halo: The Fall of Reach is easily one of my favorite novels of all time.  While I admit I enjoy the lore of the Halo universe I did read the original release in it's entirety before the release of the any Halo game.  That being said I feel I will be able to give a very truthful/accurate review on the 2010 re-issue of Halo: The Fall of Reach after reading the novel.<br /><br />First I would like to say that the negatives of this review are canon inconsistencies either not corrected from the original book or not addressed in the re-issue.  The novel is excellently written by Nylund with the material he was given in 2001 and the 2010 re-issue is for the most part the same material.  The story explains in great detail the origin of the Spartan-II super soldiers in the Halo universe.  The story is focused on one young boy named \\"John\\" who will be turned into a Spartan-II super soldier than many fans of the series will know as the Master Chief.<br /><br />While much of the book remains unchanged from the original 2001 release, the re-issue ties in some loose ends in the canon.  It answers the fate on the Spartan-III from Noble Team named Jun who was tasked with escorting Dr.Cathrine Halsey to ONI Castle Base.  It also explains why Cathrine Halsey was abducted by the Covenant leading to the events in the anime \\"The Package\\" featured in Halo: Legends.<br /><br />While the only true negatives in the re-issue are incorrect dates or corrected dates of events that are not fully explained.  Overall the story is still a five star novel that any sci-fi fan will enjoy.

0316010669|5.0|In the book, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, written by Malcolm Gladwell, he focuses on the subconscious mind and the decisions we make.  Throughout the book, he utilizes several examples and statistics that support his theories on why people make decisions the way they do.  His main focus points are about thin slicing and snap decisions, all in which addict the way we think about a person, object or an event.   Gladwell discusses thin slicing, which is that our unconscious minds have the ability to recognize and asses people and situations very quickly and accurately, all within a matter of seconds.  This is created by an individual's body language, gestures and facial expressions.  Gladwell states that people can formulate ideas even before talking to someone and make an accurate assumption of who they are or what they are really feeling.   Following thin slicing, he discusses snap decisions, which is the ability to thin slice situations to make correct judgments.  How this is done is by taking control of our snap judgments.  We must analyze the situation before letting our unconscious mind trigger.  Sure, this may be difficult, but it is necessary to practice so that snap judgments are not made.  We must ensure that our presumptions and biases do not control the way we think, for they can lead us to incorrect information and judgments.  Finally, if a person has too much information it can cloud their mind and impair their judgment.  They must focus on the current situation and make the best decision possible.   I found Blink a very easy to read and would recommend this book to other readers.  Gladwell provided some great examples that supported his theories.  This book really made me sit back and think about my previous judgments I have made in my past about people and situations I have been.  Such as when I was working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car, we had to underwrite every customer to ensure they were qualified to rent a car.  When some individuals walked through the door, I found myself immediately judging them about whether or not they were going to qualify.  Sometimes my judgments were correct and other times I was proven wrong.  There were times where very professional looking men and women have came in and I thought for sure they were going to qualify, but they were renting with a debit card or trying to rent on cash and did not have any bills or pay stubs to verify employment and residency, so unfortunately they did not qualify.  Also, there were times when people came in their pajamas looking like they had not showered in days and they were the ones who qualified.  It just goes to show that one person should never make snap judgments. They must analyze the person or situation first and then make a judgment.  Overall, I do agree with Gladwell, but I do feel that your first instinctive judgment may not always be the best and most accurate.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|You don't have to be a lover of the zombie movie genre to highly enjoy this game. It's quick, fun, and easy to pick up, and doesn't leave a dent in your wallet. You can easily complete a game of four people in 5-10 minutes, depending on how the dice fall. Because this game is mostly chance, it also keeps the winner constantly changing, with former champions being destroyed subsequent rounds. There is an element of strategy, but at some point in each game someone throws that out the window and goes all-in for the win--makes for a very entertaining playing experience.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|At the end of the film, Pitt states \\"I think this may be my masterpiece\\" (or something to that nature) and in regards to Tarantino and his directorial efforts, I think that statement may apply here (however, not in regards to Brad Pitt who, sadly, is that acting `weak link' in this film).  Yes, Tarantino will have legions of fans bickering in rabid fashion over which gargantuan cult classic is the best (most will cheer for `Pulp Fiction', some `Kill Bill' and, until I saw this film, I was all about `Reservoir Dogs') but at the end of the day, when you stack everything back to back to back, his latest effort makes it very clear that he has learned and certainly grown as a director over the course of his career.<br /><br />This film is nearly perfect.<br /><br />I could go on all day dissecting this film and layer my review with countless praise-littered sentiments, but I'm going to try and refrain, just a little.<br /><br />I'm often told I'm a tad longwinded.<br /><br />The story itself is a fabricated fantasy piece set in the times of the Nazi regime where Tarantino has a group of violence-fascinated `Nazi Killers' waging war with a `Jew Hunter' and his reign of terror.  They aren't alone in their mission of hate-filled executions though.  At the films outset we are introduced to Landa, the `Jew Hunter', as he slaughters a Jewish family taking refuge in another man's home.  One of the family members, a young girl, escapes.  She in turn, years later, is presented with a rare opportunity that she cannot let slip through her fingers; revenge.<br /><br />The film never once appears lacking in rich Tarantino style, but it also carries with it a layer of sophistication that is not found in most of his work.  It is more polished; crisper if you will.  While some will balk at my statement and point out that `Pulp Fiction' itself is `sophisticated' (an assessment I will stand behind), I feel compelled to point out that while I love both films, this latest entry in the Tarantino roster surely shows much maturing since Tarantino's 90's heyday.  The narrative flow feels far less like a gimmick (yes, that is an accusation made against `Pulp Fiction', and one that bares some truth) and more like a fully fleshed out plot piece.  And while Tarantino has shown great visual flare in many of his films, especially his `Kill Bill' epic, he has never exuded so much class into his visual opuses as he does here.  Just look at the opening sequence.  It is breathtakingly staged, brilliantly acted and flawlessly captured.  The visual is fresh, rich and certainly eye-catching, but it isn't over-the-top.  The spectacle of it all doesn't take away from the seriousness of it all.  There is the tension, the dread, the emotional gut punch; not to mention the perfectly times flares of humor that take the scene to a whole new level.  In fact, that opening sequence should be preserved in a room for all struggling artists to venture when needing inspiration (that and the opening sequence to Fincher's `The Social Network').  It is a brilliant and inspired way to open a film, setting the tone effortlessly and inviting us (or should I say CONVINCING US) to walk right alongside Tarantino for the entire journey.<br /><br />Oh lord; I am getting longwinded, aren't I?<br /><br />I wanted to touch upon the acting, because as an ensemble it really does shine (and Christoph Waltz's Oscar win was VERY deserved).  Yes, Pitt is here and he is decent but he is also a tad overdone and certainly the films weakest performance.  In fact, Fassbender has a VERY short scene and yet he acts circles around anything Pitt does, adding an entire back-story to his devilishly charming grin.  That said; Waltz is just phenomenal, layering Landa with so much unintentional wit that you can't help but totally `get this guy'.  Sure, he's a creep, but you want him around.  Besides, Waltz really understood how to work with his fellow actors.  He plays off of them in each and every scene, and it actually boosts the performances of the entire cast.  In fact, some of the best moments come from other actors working off of Waltz's presence.  The other GIGANTIC standout here is Melanie Laurent.  She is mesmerizing here, and totally nails the inner tension that presents itself in her character.  She is not only stunning (seriously, gorgeous to look at) but she embodies the films moral core (yes, it has one) and exudes a sense of profound entitlement that I think is necessary to accepting the film as more than torture-porn.<br /><br />There is a method to Tarantino's madness, and Laurent holds the key.<br /><br />In the end I'm totally in this films corner.  It really should have swept at the Oscars (at least when you consider the films it was nominated against).  This film is far more entertaining, creative, stylistic, memorable and profound than James Cameron's opus of gigantic smurf people and their protests to `save the planet'.fact, some of the best moments come from other actors working off of Waltz's presence.

I think that if your ending in the year 1966 with songs from \\"Revolver\\" you could have added \\"Taxman\\" to the mix instead of having \\"Yellow Submarine\\" to end the album.  So let me get this straight Ringo gets to sing but George is left out.  They could have a least included on George Harrison song.  Then again is they just wanted to stick to Lennon-McCartney tunes I'm pretty sure they could have included one that George sang.  I think that this was a great injustice that was corrected in the Blue album.  I think it could have been better if they would have included a song from George Harrison he deserved that much.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|If Academy Awards could be given for the worst movie of all time, then this movie would receive that dubious honor, hands down. It's boring and the cinematography is reminiscent of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\"--ONLY MORE BORING!<br /><br />Don't buy the dvd! You'll be glad you didn't!
B000002WYT|4.0|This album gave us some of DMB's best live material ever (Two Step, #41, Proudest Monkey for example), but this album just didn't do them justice in my opinion.  I hate to not give a DMB album 5 stars.  Heck I even gave Everyday 5 stars, but this album just does not provide the feel that the live versions from 95-96 had.  I heard almost every single one of these songs live before getting the album, and I wish it could have been better, but there are a few songs on this album the really do shine!!!    So Much To Say - A great way to open up the album.  Tim Reynolds bringing an electric guitar to the studio was great, and this is a very great song all around.  9/10    Two Step - Just doesn't do the song justice in my opinion.  The background vocals are kinda annoying in the chorus, and the entire song could have been done better, but still, it is worth listening to!  6/10    Crash Into Me - This is DMB's most successful single, and probably the 2nd most recognizable song besides Ants.  It's a simple love song about a guy with a huge crush on a girl.  The guy is obviously a peeping tom.  This is a very sweet song, but not one of my favorites.  6/10    Too Much - Another song that could have sounded better on this cd, but is still very enjoyable to listen to!  Basically a song about obesity and drugs.  A great DMB jam.  7/10    #41 - Starts off soft and then goes into a good melody.  This song has an extended jam at the end with a very beautiful solo by LeRoi.  This is certainly a favorite when played live.  10/10    Say Goodbye - #41 segues directly into this piece, which starts out with a beautiful flute solo by LeRoi.  The lyrics are beautiful on this song.  Definitely one of the more underrated DMB tunes out there.  10/10    Drive in Drive Out - Not one of my favorites, but it is enjoyable.  The song could have sounded better here.  5/10    Let You Down - One of those songs that most people just do not remember any more.  It was only played 6 times by the full band.I was lucky enough to hear it in 97.  They have not played it since though, which is very disappointing because this song is beautiful.  8/10    Lie in Our Graves - A happy song about being dead???  Classic DMB.  Great song.  I love the jam in the middle before the reprise outro.  Always great to be heard live.  One of my all time favorites.  10/10    Cry Freedom - A very old song known by the diehard DMB fans.  A great soft song.  Just absolutely beautiful.  10/10    Tripping Billies - Like Too Much, this song could have sounded a little better.  This song, Warehouse, and Ants are the 3 songs in my opinion that I can never decide as my all time favorite DMB tune.  I liked the Remember Two Things recording much more, but it is still a very radio friendly tune.  9/10    Proudest Monkey - A soft song, which is basically a song about the band.  It's a song about leaving the ordinary life and going to bigger places.  Beautiful piece.  The sax solo and the extended jam are just beautiful.  A great album closer.  10/10
B003V6L94Q|4.0|This is a pretty good follow up to his first album.  Much along the same lines as the first, there is 1 big hit out right now and a solid Jimmy Buffett esque sound.  For all of those people who bought the first album because of \\"Chicken Fried\\" they will undoubtedly buy this album because of \\"As Shes' Walkin Away\\", both are very good country songs.  But for those of us who loved the first album because of songs like \\"Highway 20\\" and \\"Jolene\\" I think you will be a little miffed at this album. It just doesnt have the deep line of songs to back up the smash hit.  They are good, just not REALLY good like the first one.  I will keep listening for sure and I will definitely keep buying their music, but definitely the first album is better.
0240816250|5.0|I have no idea the age of the authors, but am certain they have invested their adult lives in traditional photography and the research necessary to produce such an excellent resource for all levels of photographers.    No matter how accomplished any one photographer could be, Way Beyond Monochrome should be considered the gold standard for reference in the traditional analog photography world.    The book contains numerous examples, photographs, charts and illustrations that bring the written words to life. Many times the difference between theory and real world is often blurred. The part I enjoy most about the book is the short and concise chapters with both theory and practical applications, nothing left to trial and error.    A must read for all photographers who continue their personal photographic learning and need to know why!
B0024HH32A|2.0|I purchased a copy of the blu-ray version of M*A*S*H as it is one of my favorite films.  My old DVD copy has better definition than the new blu-ray edition.  Reading the reviews, I can not understand how this blu-ray edition is reaping such praise for the video quality. The copy I have is so grainy that it looks like it was stolen from a 42nd street grindhouse after sitting on the shelf for 20 years.  The colors are washed out; no contrast to speak of.  What gives?  What a horrible waste for such a great film!
0439023513|3.0|I really liked book one and two in the series.  This book was a little bit disappointing, though.  I feel like the author lost touch with who Katniss is.  I didn't even really like her in this book.  Also, so many people die in the book, and it all seems so pointless.  I'm sure that the author was trying to make some kind of statement about war, but it all left me feeling very sad and disappointed.  I almost didn't even want to finish the book.
0061998494|5.0|I read this autobiography on the beach and was laughing out loud at some sections!  I absolutely LOVE Craig Fergeson, and, after reading his book, adore him even more!  It's quite interesting; a fast read.  You won't be disappointed!
0807014273|5.0|I read this book because I sometimes struggle to find meaning in my life and wanted to learn more about what it was like to \\"live\\" in a concentration camp.  I find it hard to believe there is so much hate in this world that would drive one group of people to want to kill and oppress not only one other person, but an entire race of people.  The hate is there and it is awful.  Since I feel sorry for myself and become depressed more than I would like, I found more meaning to my life just from reading this book.  I can't imagine what it would be like to survive such a horrific event such as this.  For people to find meaning in their lives while experiencing these tragedies is amazing.  I think many of us can apply logotherapy in our lives too.  The logotherapy examples the author described that helped his patients were interesting because they worked and now I want to apply them in my own life.  The fact that the author experienced these awful things and was able to learn from it and help other people is awesome.  This book is a great read for everyone, especially ones who are depressed.  It is important to find meaning in your life.  Like Viktor Frankl suggests, we can start by loving people and becoming more responsible.

1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder, as a whole, is an awesome game.  It 100% lives up to all the hype that has been made about this \\"D&D 3.75\\".<br /><br />For those who don't know, it basically takes 3.5e and does what Wizards of the Coast should have done, instead of 4e.  Take the 3.5 rules, fix some mechanics, including making critical hits slightly harder and clarifying various rules on weight mechanics, et cetera, and add awesome new stuff to things like the sorcerer rules, explaining different methods by which they get their powers and giving them new, individualistic powers for it!<br /><br />Negatives (very small):<br /><br />The book cover was a bit warped, making the pages not sit right.  It corrected itself in a day or two.  Shipping problem?<br /><br />Sometimes, it can be a little difficult to find specific rules, almost as if you are expected to know them from 3.5 stuff.  Overall, this is only noticeable if you are rules obsessive or GMing.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars, easy.  Good job Paizo!!
0439023513|5.0|Amazon review  MOCKINGJAY  The Third and final Book of  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins   In my review of The Hunger Games Books One and Two I warned readers to set aside a block of time before beginning the read because they would never be able to put the novel down.

0553805371|5.0|First off I will say that I loved this book. It doesn't go into great detail about quantum physics but it explains it in a way that almost anyone can understand. It was very interesting and once I started it I could'nt put it down. Before I knew it I had finished within a day! If you are interested in physics and the creation of the Universe but are not a scientist pick this book up. If you have been reading books of this sort for years I would say skip it because there is probably not much new here. The book poses questions such as \\"Why are we here?\\" and \\"How were we created?\\" If you are looking for those answers from this book then you're out of luck and essentially out of luck no matter what book you pick up. Nevertheless the book was perfect for me and I got exactly what I wanted out of it and that was a general understanding of quantum physics, the creation of the universe and the confidence to pick a more elaborate, more detailed book of the same material.

0061703257|3.0|I read this book in October 2010--have not seen the movie.  This is a good page-turner, but nothing revolutionary.  I will probably see the movie now, but I don't expect to get that much out of it.  I wonder if I would have even liked the book if I saw the movie first, because this is one of those stories with a puzzle that makes you want to find out how all the pieces fit together.  If I knew the ending, I don't think I would have been as interested.

B0042GSRVC|5.0|Pink Floyd has put out many albums in their very successful and progressive musical career, Animals has got to be not only one of The Floyd's greatest achievements, but a great achievement also for the whole of the music industry. Animals includes five songs including Pigs (three different ones), Pigs on the Wing part 1 and 2, Dogs, and Sheep. In my opinion this album is a masterpiece, a truly original and diverse composition of songs. One song on this album that i would like to talk about further is \\"Dogs\\" which is about half the album and takes up a complete side with the exaction of Pigs on the Wing part 1. I think this song is a true mastery of the craft and is at a level of quality and excellence that is rarely seen or achieved in the music industry, and may never be accomplished again especially in today's music box that today's artists and bands are in. Two other songs i would like to note are Pigs on the Wing part 1 and 2. Though about ten to sixteen minutes shorter than the rest of the album, are two great acoustic songs both sung by Roger Waters who also wrote the lyrics for the entire album. These two songs really (in my opinion) show the diversity that Pink Floyd has to offer, they also show what a talented and diverse guitarist David Gilmour is who can go from a psychedelic and seductive solo to simple chords on the acoustic in a single album.      As you have probably noticed, if you have a set of eyes, that all the songs are titled after Animals (what a coincidence, LOL). All jokes aside, this album is roughly based around George Orwell's Animal Farm, except this album is more  a critic of the capitalist system which is to the contrary of Orwell's Animal Farm which is a critic of Communism. Nonetheless, a great album, and an album you should listen to at least once in your lifetime.
0316098337|3.0|If someone walks up to you on street and punches you in the stomach, you will likely remember it.   You'll remember it even more if the person who punches you does it in a remarkably interesting and difficult way, such as blindfolded, while hanging upside down from a tree.   But it is still a punch in the stomach.    I didn't much enjoy this book because it was depressing and sad and frustrating.  The writing was interesting and smart and clever and I'm still thinking about the book days after reading it, but not really in a good way.

The person that I bought it from made sure that they took really good care it. I sincerely thank you for that. It makes my watching it every moment a pleasant one. I would buy from them again with no problem. It came just in time for my movie night. Hassle free!!! Thank you again for your pleasant introduction to your company and any future purchases that I will make. You are on the best list possible with me.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I admit to copious tears at the end of this movie and it was not just because the ending was so sad with everyone who was loving and honorable being destroyed by religion. What saddened me the most is that we haven't changed much in 1700 years.  At least Hypatia has finally gotten her due and the Bishop of Alexandria, \\"St. Cyril\\" his. I wouldn't be surprised if a few Catholic churches dedicated to him don't change their name if this film gets much attention.<br /><br />How can you possibly talk about this film without discussing the history behind it?? I don't think you can because that is its beauty. Its true.  Amenabar recreates the city and the violence that surrounded the Library of Alexandria in the 400's with a broad but honest brush. It was a complex time of religious intolerance born partially of the political manipulations of rulers who were being forced to deal with the social and economic crumbling of the Roman Empire.<br /><br />At this point in time, Christianity had taken on a kind of \\"social welfare\\" role that was attracting many adherents. Amenabar concentrates more on Christianities philosophical influence which given the level of violence and intolerance, was at best poorly understood by the people. As the Christian segment grows in power, he shows us how the discord between it and the city's Jewish and Pagan factions explode in the form of murderous encounters.<br /><br />We meet the beautiful Hypatia teaching a group of obviously well-off young men as the film opens. When the violence starts she is the voice of logic and peace, but with the exception of the actual sacking of the library, she remains concerned almost solely with her science throughout the film and is an innocent victim of intolerance. Hers is the rational mind with no will to power. It is a mind dedicated to ideals rather than the dogma of any faith. Most of the  dramatic content comes from the struggle of those around her to maintain their honor and loyalty in the face of increasingly deadly threats from the Christian mobs.<br /><br />Her ability to immerse herself in her science is dramatized by her devotion to experiments and breaks from the movie in which the camera pulls out and views the earth from space give us a feel for the scope of her mind. These interludes not only give us an interesting perspective on the difference between her thinking and that of zealots like Cyril, they are also used to provide written historical information about what is about to take place in the next segment.<br /><br />Amenabar keeps us hooked on the action as one side and then the other exacts its revenge. As the movie draws to its end we focus on the inner moral dilemma of Orestes, the Roman civil authority who supported Hypatia and the cities Pagan intellectuals. Cyril bates him into refusing to submit to \\"Gods\\" (Cyril's) authority in front of a crowd and turns the mob against him. Narrowly escaping with his life, Amenabar cuts between his internal struggle and that of Hypatia's former slave, as he renounces his new found Christianity in a last ditch attempt to save his former owner.<br /><br />The movie ends with Hypatia's death amid a group of ignorant, filthy, men who call her a witch and a whore. Their hooded faces remind us that we stand on the verge of hundreds of years of intellectual darkness that may not have ended yet.rom the Christian mobs.

B003ZDZ1WG|3.0|...Or am I the only one who's troubled by the apparently unchallenged pro-suicidal message of \\"If I Die Young\\"?  Seems a little creepy to me. (Not to mention whiny and self-involved... but then again, I guess it IS a teenage suicidal angst ballad, so why wouldn't it be whiny and self-involved?) But I wouldn't want any kid I know singing along to this song.    Anyway, Kimberly Perry is obviously a potential major talent for the mainstream country scene: this debut's teenage-diary lyrics don't offer much artistic depth, but the record does reveal a lot of her raw charisma. I'd be interested to see her dig a little deeper and try tackling something with more maturity and intellectual heft -- in the meantime, she's going to look great singing at all the awards shows.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|The less you know about this book the better.  All you pretty much need to know is that it's written from the perspective of a 5 year old, which is far less annoying than it sounds, and that it's REALLY good.  Go read it.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I watch the TV show \\"Castle\\", so the characters, although sporting different names, are as comfortable as a pair of worn shoes. I like the banter between the principals, and the plot is just a device to provide opportunities for the writer and the cop to joust with one another. If you read this and don't picture Nathan and Stana, and the precinct room from the show, you have far more imagination than I do. If you have no experience with \\"Castle\\" then I am not sure how this will go over. I expect it will still be fun, but go to Hulu and watch a few episodes before you dig into this.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Great, great show!!!  My husband and I love this show so much.  So far, we own the two seasons that are available for sale and will continue to buy future seasons.  We love it so much that we have a kitten whose name is Jackson, (or Jax for short).  He is a wonderful animal with a lot of spunk, just like his name sake.  I look forward to future seasons.

It has an engaging story and covers a lot of basic and new lore for Guild Wars 2.  It centers around Dougal and his make shift party to recover an artifact from a haunted city.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I credit Jillian Michaels--and WW--with my post-baby weight loss. These workouts are tough, and you will not be able to get through any of the three workouts completely the first few times around. This fitness instructor means business, and if you stick to the routine, you will see and feel results. Period. She advertises a 20-minute workout, but with the warm-up and cool-down, you're looking at 30-minutes. Not a big difference.
0446563048|5.0|Great book!!!   Simple, conversation style writing reels you right in.   The author, co-founder of zappos, humble despite all of his achievements, paints such a detailed picture of his life you can almost see the places and events.      In these days of tightening margins, in an effort to reduce costs, we are all seeing companies across the board cutting costs on all the wrong areas (try getting a hold of Sprint, Citizen's Bank, US Airways...) and if you do get a hold of anyone, the experience is so horrible you want to take a shower afterwards.     He realized that consistently great experience, from start to finish (and then some), will keep customers for life, and goes into great depth to describe how they are getting there and constantly evolving.    Not crazy about the chapter where the employees write paragraphs, for no other reason other that different writing styles change the dynamics of the flow.
B003WTE886|5.0|Ive always liked Taylor Swift's music,but ive never found myself constantly listening to more than half of FEARLESS or her debut album,well,with SPEAK NOW its different. Shes grown a lot as an artist in every aspect,her songwriting skills (which i found incredibly good from day 1) are simply astonishing this time around,and that shows in songs like Haunted and Enchanted,both of which are beautifully written and give me goosebumps every time i listen to them.<br />The hooks and melodies are catchier than ever,and the album in itself,though not perfect,is not diminished due to lack of editing like some people online are suggesting (some songs are longer than they should be, tho that doesnt bother me because i dont like artists cutting their songs to appeal to radios and masses),but rather the subject matter of songs like Mine and Last Kiss. Granted,they are also beautifully crafted and executed,but they are the same old taylor and dont show growth like the rest of the songs do.<br /><br />Recommended: Sparks Fly (Catchy,Very Very Catchy),Haunted,Enchanted,Innocent (Astonishing production,lyricism and execution),The story of us,Back to december,Better than revenge (This last one is a side of Taylor we havent seen,and i like it,shes cocky,confident and still manages to keep her charm)<br /><br />PS: I rarely write reviews for anything,specially albums since im very picky,but this deserved whatever review i could give it,even if its not the best review ever i think ive said what the album made me feel and hope others give themselves the opportunity to check this out without prejudice from her past albums<br /><br />Overall: 5/5,its not a classic but its her best work to date and shes getting close to that masterpiece,hopefully shell give us just that the next time around.This however proves she is here to stay and is not just some overhyped pop diva,she can really sing,write and compose music that is timeless and appeals to the masses,shes making history
B003Q6D25U|4.0|Well, I planned on waiting for the DVD release of Paranormal Activity 2, but I read some reviews saying that it was better than the original. I liked the simplicity and slow building nature of the scares in the surprisingly high grossing debut, so I didn't know if this sequel would feel too much like a been there, done that. The answer is yes, but this is the rare second film that improves upon many of the weaknesses of the first. We now get multiple camera set-ups thanks to a pimped out security system, along with a few more characters that don't tend to get on your nerves quite as much as the two leads in the original. I didn't know that this was a prequel going in, so I was a little surprised when Katie and Micah showed up. Turns out, her sister's family was the where the demonic haunting originated. I really liked how they connected the two movies.<br /><br />If you hated Paranormal Activity, stay far away from this one. It has the same slow pacing and often annoying camera work, though much more controlled this time around. A few of the jump scares got my attention, but it also never loses the subtle creepiness that builds with each passing day spent with this family. Sure it's not anything new or a huge upgrade, but in this day and age of horror remakes and horror franchises that don't know when to die (I'm looking at you SAW \\"I'm too embarrassed to call it SAW VII\\" 3D), at least they have come up with a fresh formula that has gotten back to the basics.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I would have liked to have seen Agora in a theater; but the film played in such a limited number of theaters and for such a short time that it was not possible to see it.  I read about Hypatia some years ago and thought that her story would make a good drama. When I learned about this film, I was excited to see it.     Alexandria had a turbulent history under the Romans with the Greeks, Jews and Christians at each other's throats.  The culmination of the violence came when the emperor Theodosius I declared Christianity as the official state religion.  Pagan faiths that had been tolerated before were now subjected the same persecution that the Christians had endured in earlier centuries.      (There are minor spoilers in the next two paragraphs)  The film opens with a scene where Hypatia is teaching her students about the movement of the planets. This is the focus for Hypatia's teaching although as a neo-Platonist her subjects would have been more diverse.  Orestes, very well played by Oscar Issac, is one of Hypatia's students and openly declares her love for her but is rebuffed by her.  Hypatia class holds Christians and pagans, and she stresses that with her they are all brothers, not members of different religious faiths.     Hypatia has an interesting relationship with a slave named Davus (played with sensitivity by Max Minghella).  When Davus declares himself a Christian Hypatia's father (a high official in the cult of Seraphis) punishes Davus. However, Hypatia looks after Davus and presents him to her class when he creates a model of the universe. Symbolically, when the Christian's storm the Seraphium Hypatia frees Davus. The film departs from the facts of Hypatia's life in presenting her death, poetically, at the hands of Davus instead of a mob of Christians. I liked the change for the loving kindness that Hypatia's former slave has for her in order to spare her a painful death.     Rachael Weisz succeeds in brining Hypatia to life. She is passionate about herteaching and learning and sticking to her principles as the world she has known is being destroyed. The scenes that come to mind are those where she is with her students and where she puzzles over the precise movements of the planets. Michael Lonsdale is very good as Hypatia's father.     Alejandro Amenabar is to be congratulated for this powerful film. The production is very good particularly with the re-creation of the Serapeum. The riot scenes are nicely staged and the costumes very nicely designed with the period in mind. Agora is a film covering a period of time that is rarely portrayed in film.  Hypatia is one of the rare women of antiquity who steps beyond the bounds that men set for women. Being able to see a film celebrating her life is an event in itself.
B003VIW8DK|4.0|I just listened to the new Bryan Ferry album OLYMPIA.  This album is the perfect match to 2002's FRANTIC.  Not to put down 2007's DYLANESQUE but this album puts Bryan back in top form.  We begin with the song YOU CAN DANCE, which is groove oriented track that can close down any nightclub. It's sultry nature harkens back to the BETE NOIR album. It's a killer track that uses a keyboard sample from the song TRUE TO LIFE from ROXY MUSIC's AVALON album.<br /><br /> The second song is ALPHAVILLE, which any die-hard fan knows that the song was to be the title track for an album entitled ALPHAVILLE which either got shelved or never came to fruition. It is a modest rocker with some really decent guitar hooks.  It was co-written by Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics who has produced Bryan in previous efforts.<br /><br />  On to my favorite song... ME OH MY, I can't properly describe this song other than it's AWESOME! I love the vocal arrangements, the piano, the guitars everything. It has a melody that that makes you hit the repeat button often.  In my opinion it's easily the best song on the album.<br /><br />SHAMELESS is a collaboration with GROOVE ARMADA and was released earlier this year. It is a pure club song of which I'm glad that Bryan is going back to those kinds of songs.  He has an inate ability to find grooves that really hold up and the collaboration with Groove Armada enhances that experience, which allows for re-mixes.<br /><br />SONG TO THE SIREN is a TIM BUCKLEY (late singer/songwriter and father of the late singer/songwriter JEFF BUCKLEY : see my review of Jeff's album GRACE ) remake that sounds like a Ferry original.  Ferry has a knack for turning other people's material into standards that are better than the original artist(s).  NO FACE, NO NAME, NO NUMBER is another re-make of an old TRAFFIC song that sounds better than the original.  Ferry's vocals are effortless and smooth on this track, an absolute gem.<br /><br />BF BASS ( Ode to Olympia ) is co-written by ROXY MUSIC bandmate PHIL MANZANERA and feels like a track off of Ferry's 1993 album TAXI. It's a decent track but I feel the weakest.<br /><br />HEARTACHE BY NUMBERS is reminiscent of a track off 2002's FRANTIC and has a shimery chorus that leaves the listener chanting the title of the song over and over.  A really good track.<br /><br />REASON OR RHYME is a Ferry original that sounds like it could have been a track for the new ROXY MUSIC record. It clocks in at 6:52 and harkens back to when ROXY MUSIC had those mini opus tracks from the SIREN era.  It has an interesting chorus and hook but too long.<br /><br />TENDER IS THE NIGHT is the final song on the standard version of OLYMPIA and is co-written by DAVE STEWART and feels like an ELVIS ballad to me or maybe a track from FRANTIC. A soft and gentle track that is appropriate for a closer.<br /><br />The extended version includes 2 additional tracks: JOHN LENNON's WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH THE NIGHT and a ELVIS PRESELY standard ONE NIGHT.<br /><br />This album is sulky and sexy and show's that BRYAN FERRY IS BACK AND IN HIS TRUE FORM.<br /><br />BRIAN ENO's sonics and undercurrents are everywhere on this record.  It's stacked full of talent from FLEA of the RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS, Bass player MARCUS MILLER, Super Producer NILE RODGERS on guitar, DAVID GILMOUR from PINK FLOYD, PHIL MANZANERA, ANDY MACKAY, PAUL THOMPSON, TARA FERRY and on and on THIS IS A GREAT RECORD. Not to mention a cover to kill for with the lovely KATE MOSS as the cover model.  GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!and feels like a track off of Ferry's 1993 album TAXI.

B00003CXB4|3.0|I really like this movie for my son the only thing that i didnt like is that i wanted the original and this seems like its pirate not like the original box or movie other than that no scratches it was in really good condition the person i bought this from is FOX SELLER
0451205766|5.0|I did not expect this to be so good. It's not a literary masterpiece -- in fact, the writing is laugh-out-loud bad in places -- but it's got a great plot and it holds up surprisingly well compared to the movie. There are far more details in the book that add depth and background to the characters and scenes in the movie. This is a guilty pleasure kind of a read, but anyone who likes crime thrillers should enjoy this. Puzo's pacing and plotting makes up for the turgidity of his writing. There's a genius to every move in the Corleones' war, and an explanation for a lot of character actions, that's lost in the cinematic version.<br /><br />I can't really explain my love for this book. It's way outside my usual genre and frankly, it's kind of schlocky, but I have to give it five stars because I enjoyed it so much. It'd definitely worth reading if you've only seen the movie.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|If you have seen Sleeping with the Enemy, you have already read this book.  It`s an OK read, but the similarities are many, right down to the carnival scene
B003UYUR10|5.0|This also was a great movie hope they do another.  Jake was great.  Amazing more like it.  I would love to see clips of him learning to do all that stuff.  I understand he trained extremely hard for this movie.  Very well done movie.  Probably one of the best adaptations from video game to movie.
142311339X|5.0|Rick Riordan's \\"The Lost Hero\\" is, to me at least, an even better start to a series than \\"The Lightning Thief\\" was to the Percy Jackson series. I could be biased, of course, because I already have read the entire Percy Jackson series, and thus was already hooked before beginning. There is another reason, though.<br /><br />I have always been fascinated by Greek and Roman mythology, and studied them both extensively in my younger days. Why is that any more important for this series than the last? In \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\" series, it is not just Greek mythology that undergirds the story. Now, he interweaves threads from Roman mythology, the very close counterpart to Greek mythology.<br /><br />Now, a couple of important points:<br /><br />1) In tradition, when the Greeks finally defeated Troy, Aeneas flees Troy and has his adventure, as told in the Latin classic, the Aeneid. As a former citizen of Troy, and a demigod (son of Aphrodite and Anchises), Aeneas makes it to Italy, where his descendants become the founders and rulers of Rome, worshiping the same gods as before, but most with different names and personalities.<br /><br />2) Another crucial part of the story deals with a stronger threat to the demigods than what they dealt with in the last series. There is a greater and more primeval threat to the order of things than the Titans of Percy Jackson fame.<br /><br />Why are these things important? No, I'm not going to tell you the story, like so many others -- you have to read it yourself to discover the significance of these points I have put forward (or read reviews that contain spoilers). I do recommend reading the Percy Jackson series, first, if you haven't yet.
0061537969|5.0|The art of racing in the rain gives you hope that the pet you told everyone thought he was human was. This book had me crying and laughing from beginning to end. It gave me hope.
142311339X|5.0|I was not disappointed with this book - in fact I love it. Roman demigods meet Greek demigods with Hera trying to bring the family together.  Old characters from the Percy Jackson's books and now a new character named Jason.  I feel for Jason - no memory, no family and this life as the son of Zeus slowly comes back.  Do we trust Hera?  Once again, Olympus is in danger and not the one in New York. The original one in Greece.  I am just unhappy that I have to wait untill Spring, 2011 for the second book.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|I like both Kiss & Tell and A Year Without Rain.  Selena Gomez does not sing that good but I really like the songs in both CDs.  Even the little 10 year old Jackie can sing much better.      Songs from Kiss & Tell are mostly good old Disney up beat happy dance songs.  Songs from A Year Without Rain move away from the Disney beat and are kinda blue and rock songs.  I like both of them.    Both CDs comes with beautiful booklet with pages and pages of beautiful pictures.  The theme from this CD is green and blue.  The theme from Kiss & Tell is black and red.  Both are very beautiful.    I like Selena Gomez' CD.  I will buy her cd again.
067144901X|5.0|If you have a youngster this book is a \\"must have.\\" My little girl, 16 months, loves making animal noises.  This book is fun because there are a couple of twists to the sounds, and at the end you can review all the animal noises.  Very interactive
B000L43AN4|5.0|I've been a Waits fan since I discovered Swordfishtrombones in the mid-80s. I've bought pretty much everything he's done since then with the exception of Real Gone, which I missed for some reason. That said I think if I was to recommend something to a total Waits noob it would be this box set. Its simply a magnificent sampler of his unique talents. Even without the extra Orphans disc it would be worth the asking price. Brawlers is simply brilliant. I have had it on heavy rotation in the car the last few days and I can't get enough of it. It's actually bordering on obscene how one man can have so much talent. Its like looking at a picture of Marilyn Monroe - too much beauty! The stand-out track among many fine offerings has to The Road to Peace. At first I couldnt believe I was hearing right. Waits doing a political song? But of course its brilliant. Sums up that crazy situation with total dead-nuts accuracy. Sad as hell too in true Waits style. He needs to do more 'protest' stuff. He could be the new Dylan! haha. The real surprise for me was Bawlers. I usually dont take to his maudlin stuff all that well but the tracks here are really quite beautiful, so tender and handled with a lovely delicate touch. Of course, musically it's impeccable. I don't think people appreciate just how musically accomplished Waits is as a composer and conductor. Never a note out of place. The production is impeccable too. Like I said, obscene! The two discs together represent the yin and yang of Waits' personality perfectly. Not since Alice and Blood Money have we been so blessed with an abundance of Waits. Simply glorious.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I know that this may seem like a rehash of the multiple reviews already written out there about how this one is grower, but it isn't. When this album came out, I was on vacation in Canada, and I was in disbelief when my friend and I decided to casually visit a Canadian \\"Borders\\" just to laugh at what the Canadians listened to AND i saw that the new iron maiden album had come out. i decided that I had to have it even though it was an overpriced 20CAD. I put it on. And after just one listen, I tried to return it to the store, but i already had opened it. Oh well i said to myself, this band really is getting old and this probably is their last album, so it'll make a great collector's item. I mean -- I liked \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Satellite 15\\", but I thought that everything on the album was disappointing.     I got this album in August, and now its October, and i can tell you. This album blows all the turds that iron maiden has been feeding us for the last decade out of the toilet! The latter half of the album is so hard to get into, but it really is truly remarkable. it sounds like 30 years of experience finally got funneled and transformed into the most successful anything Maiden has done. If only they had done this when they were younger, this album would probably rank among the top 5 maidens.   Fav tracks are: Isle of Avalon, Talisman, Starblind, and When The wild winds blows
B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|Wow, I am going to be hated for this.  This is my first ever unfavorable opinion of a Miyazaki film, and it saddens me greatly that I did not enjoy it.  But I honestly did not enjoy \\"Ponyo\\".  The artwork and animation are both great, so I give it 2 stars for that.  But...        I didn't like any of the characters very much.  Miyazaki's usually rich character development seems missing here.  Maybe this _was_ meant for 5-year olds, I dunno, but I just couldn't make much sense of hardly anything in the movie.  It jumped around from one place to the other and I just couldn't come to care about any of the characters very much.  The slight plot didn't do a whole lot for me, and I'm growing ever more tired of \\"ecological messages\\", especially when voiced by known Hollywood Liberals, and wrapped in dealings with Moon/Sea/Whatever gods/goddesses.          I thought that Ponyo's father was just creepy, and his mumblings did little to explain anything, and at times just seemed forced to provide enough convenient narration to keep things moving.  So much of \\"Ponyo\\" just feels like it needs a lot more fleshing out.  Her mother was left just too much of a mystery for me as well.         Sosuke's parents are likewise cyphers.  His mother's driving was insane, and his Dad is more or less a vapor on the sea.         So much is just rushed along.  The fate of the world depends on the love of a young boy for a fish/girl/goddess???  Hrmmm...  So what happens to the moon & other disastrous things approaching, why do the old ladies feel better, what's going on...???         I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings or take a child's movie too seriously, I just want to express that though I consider myself a huge Miyazaki fan, I was disappointed with this one.  It's just nowhere near the level of \\"Totoro\\" or \\"Spirited Away\\" or \\"Princess Mononoke\\", to me.           And I wondered if it was just too \\"Japanese\\" for me, so I asked a Japanese friend, who had told me before I watched it thatshe hadn't liked it, if I was just \\"not getting\\" it. She told me that she hadn't understood a lot of it either, didn't like the movie, and thought it was a big mess, so I don't think I have this opinion just because I'm a big dumb American.  But that's a sample size of only 2.         Well, anyway, this is just my personal opinion of one movie by an otherwise superb director and animator.  I hope that others continue to enjoy \\"Ponyo\\", but I don't think it should be blindly accepted as terrific just because it's \\"a Miyazaki\\".  If I was 5 again, maybe I'd love it :)

B0048LPRCS|5.0|If there was ever a two minute opening credit sequence that could grab me by the balls, it's from Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void. I'm confident it will have that effect on most people. You can see it here if you don't believe me. I've never seen anything quite like it.  It's a strange beginning when considering the way it contrasts with the rest of the film. This hyper-frenetic, psychedelic introduction is the star of a film running around two and a half hours, and you'll feel every minute of its run time.    Noé has made a career as provocateur.  His last few films involve a level of violence, sex and depravity (and a mixture of all three) that anyone could argue is excessive and exploitive.  The problem, however, is that Noé is so talented, it can't altogether be dismissed.  It reminds of Lars von Trier, and his latest film Antichrist.  Enter the Void doesn't represent a marked change in style for Noé.  All the base elements are there: sex, drugs, incest, abortion.  And it's completely warranted to feel you're owed an explanation as to why you should subject yourself to them.  I don't have an answer.  But I can say that there are such dazzling flashes of genius sprinkled in throughout the film, that wading through the rest of the bog will be worth it for some.  Even though you'll come out of the experience probably feeling dirty, and empty.    Enter the Void is losely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, a canon of scripture for Buddhists.  It is an instructional manuel filled with directives for those between this life, and their next reincarnation-what they should prepare to experience, and how they should react.  Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) is an American, living in Tokyo.  Or at least a Noé-esque Tokyo full of drugs and bass-thumbing club music.  He begins to deal some drugs and doing a lot of heavy psychedelics; the film opens on him smoking a bowl of DMT.  Here, the screen evolves into rotation patterns, made up of bright colors, accompanied by resonant sounds.  It's very clearly an hommage to Stanley Kubrick's famous tunnel of colored light scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  When the film premiered at Cannes, it was seventeen minutes longer.  Seventeen extra minutes of these sorts of effects.        Shot from Oscar's point of view, we mainly get to see the back of his neck, only glancing at his face when he looks in a mirror.  He gets gunned down by Tokyo police in a seedy club bathroon.  As he's trying to dispose of his stash, he yells that he has gun to prevent them from entering his stall.  He dies.  At this point, Oscar's essence slowly seperates from his body, and the remainder of the film, still in Oscar's perspective, is seen from what is now nearly a third person, but wordless narrative.  He floats about the city, through walls, no longer constrained by the limits of a physical body, but unable to communicate with the world that surrounds him.    He weaves in andout of his friends' presences, and follows his sister, Linda, around (a ubiquitously nude Paz de la Heurta).  Linda, a stripper at a club named Sex Power Money) and Oscar share a bond much too close for comfort since a horrific, shared experience in their youth involving the death of their parents.  Noé subjects the audience to this experience over and over again on screen which results in a slightly jarred understanding of why Linda and Oscar's relationship is so distorted.  There are many scenes too unpleasant for any film.  Particularly, an extremely realistic and graphic abortion, and an explicit sex scene made up of impossible, and impossibly candid shots.    Enter the Void could easily be classified as experimental as there's not really much that happens on screen from a plot's perspective.  It's a lot of floating-in-the-sky camera work, with little onscreen substance.  On one hand, this leaves plenty of room for meditation on what death is, and how we can, or should relate to it.  And it's easy to take advantage of this opportunity.  On the otherhand, two hours of mediation isn't always the desired product when heading to the movies.    Noé provides his shocks and provocations.  There's no shortage of them.  But every now and then, all of the wildly unrestrained facets of the film converge and the cacophony of it all gets quite.  Then there are, quite literally, revelatory moments that make Enter the Void exhaustively interesting, and completely unforgettable.
0757302661|5.0|I read this book and also took a hypnobirthing class.  This is a MUST have book for every expecting mother.  I had my baby 7mo ago, and am still amazed by the experience.  This was my third baby, all of them natural, but none of them like this.   Having given birth twice before, I was more than skeptic, but thought it couldn't hurt.  I had 3 support people with me @ the hospital and all 3 of them were sleep!  They thought I was sleep!  I highly recomend taking a class along with this book, but it is not neccessary.  DO read the book more than once, and DEFINITELY practice the breathing techniques!!  The SURGE breathing especially!  I PROMISE, if done correctly, you will feel no-pain!!  I had a PAIN FREE, DRUG FREE, SCREAM FREE birth!!!  IT REALLY IS POSSIBLE!!!

B003UESJJC|4.0|When you insert this BLU RAY disk, at first it will seems like it is not going to play.<br />Then after about a minute a status bar appears on screen. Then if you're not connected to the internet,<br />about two minutes later you get the message \\"NETWORK CONNECTION FAILED\\" Then finally the movie starts.<br />I like the feature that allows you to create your own bookmarks on the DVD. The movie quality is amazing.<br />The  \\"Hearts of darkness\\" documentary quality is fair to good. All other special features are good to excellent.

0525951652|1.0|Having savored every word of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", I feel great disappointment in Follett's latest book. What caught my immediate attention were the \\"thin\\" characterizations, each one nominally no more than a stick figure upon an epic World War I scene that was described in the same thinness. Further setbacks in my reading were the \\"chance\\" meetings of the characters, each one seemingly contrived for convenience of the storyline and smacking of unbelievability. The portrayal of witty characters, both historical and fictional, lacked depth and sometimes purpose. The unusual number of sexual encounters came across as shallow, certainly not titillating to the reader's imagination. I think Follett has become a \\"commercial\\" writer now, exchanging a beautiful talent for words governed by the lure of a dollar sign. This book reminds me so much of some of Michener's and Grisham's later works when they, too, had become commercial. I can't see that a trilogy will rescue this initial effort.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|As an American, I am disheartened when I see the gift that is David Attenborough removed only to be replaced with Oprah.  The same Oprah that knows nothing of the sciences and seems to revel in it when she had guests like Depac Chopra or Tom Cruise on her show... Not to mention all the pseudo science crap that she has passed along to her viewers over the decades.  If you *do* watch this version, might I suggest muting the sound?
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was shocked by the quality of this item when I received it in the mail(it's awesome).  I went by reviews when picking this out and am glad I did.  Running a Core i7-875k at 3.8ghz with this baby and plan to up it to 4ghz after adding a second fan.  Havn't ran any CPU torture tests yet but the hottest I've had it to is 40 degrees C.   It is huge but you should know that considering it has a 120mm fan on it.  Amazon is selling this baby at a great price and I highly recommend it.  If you have a good case with nice air flow you can really jack up the speeds of i7 processors.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|We live here in the Albuquerque area, where the show is shot in many local settings------my brother in Arizona was almost in total disbelief that I wasn't following it as he had been since it's first broadcast.  Then my sister-in-law sends us Season 1, and of course, we're off and running---and it's then no less than 3 episodes every time we sit down to view any of it!  The second season has just been devoured, thanks to Netflix--in the same fashion...it's always a minimum of 3 episodes straight before we can allow ourselves to move away from the TV and say, \\"oh my God!\\"  Like another reviewer remarked, this surpasses LOST, MadMen, and is giving the Sopranos a run for the money in the Best TV Series Ever-category!  All the superlatives have been used, so just one word remains to describe this kick-ass super-drama: \\"edgy\\".....four letters that paint the picture that I've had tatooed in my brain since Season 1-episode 1.  Stop burning your precious evening hours after dinner watching some lame reality crap--and check into some real drama that will quicken your pulse and make you feel that your world is probably OK after all, when you see some of the personal hell and flaming hoops that these characters jump through each week....to survive the machinations of their desperation while creating the unintended consequences that ripple out in every direction.  Superb acting, rich writing, and great (and pretty accurate) scene/set development to allow the action to unfold from.....there's obviously more to northern-central New Mexico than green and red chile, killer climate, and unlimited outdoor recreation opportunities.

0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Blink provoked some great thoughts on the power of the human subconscious and rapid cognition.  It's amazing to think about the split second decisions we make every day that are based on first impressions or hunches and how they impact our lives.  There are so many interrelated factors that we are somehow able to instantly process react accordingly.  More interesting is that these \\"thin slices\\" usually generate a reaction that is pure, meaning it is very close to the truth or the best route to take in a given situation.  Blink discusses both the good and the bad ways we do this and how controlling the process and focusing on the right information can benefit us.    In my experience, when people over-think a situation or a problem, the end result can easily end up being worse than if they would have trusted their first instinct and gone with it.   That being said, there are definitely times where a rational and well thought out decision making process is key to success.  The trick is knowing when to rely on the power of thin-slicing and when to opt for a more robust process.  In business, it is easy to see the struggle between the two approaches.      Organizations rely on research, planning, and process to make important decisions on finances and strategy.  Going this route is certainly prudent and leads to desired results.  However, this corporate bureaucracy can also be a huge waste of time if applied to every situation, and can cause companies to be very sluggish in responding to change and getting things done.  Conversely, if companies don't do their due diligence and are too quick to react, they can cause tremendous damage to their financial situation, reputation, and brand.  Companies need to carefully manage when they rely on bureaucracy and when they can leverage thin slicing techniques to just react and move on.

1603580557|5.0|In the middle of the book, Donella outlines the 12 most strategic intervention points within a system. Her number one, most strategic intervention point is in transcending paradigms. That's what this book fosters -- transcending paradigms.     Become a meta thinker, look at the systemic whole before becoming entranced and consumed by the minuscule details. If zen could be put into scientific models, I see it taking a form very similar to this book. Systems thinking is a zen level of thinking, beyond our egoic tendencies and habits -- finding where information or resources flow from, end up, what feedback loops are perpetuating or limiting the system. We are ourselves very complex systems, embedded within millions of systems. This book is a wonderful introduction to systems thinking, and will benefit all who pick it up.      As a whole-systems designer, this reading has had huge implications on my professional and personal works. Step back, take a deep breath, observe before interpreting, see the system flow. That's HUGE, no matter where you live, work, play, this writing will add new dimensions to your mental models. One may find themselves instead of observing isolated events or objects, seeing the many influences, interconnections and feedback loops that create and give life to observed reality.

B003XDUCIG|4.0|Updated review:<br /><br />The kindle version has been updated, and the formatting issues have been largely addressed.  Updating star rating to 4 stars - pretty neat book.<br /><br />Old review:<br /><br />While I greatly enjoyed the book's content, the formatting was especially screwy on my kindle app on ipad: I can't recommend the book for people who are planning to read it on that platform.<br /><br />A fair amount of content was in tabular form - and the tables are more or less illegible on my iPad.<br /><br />For a book aimed at tech people, this is pretty unforgivable.
0316010669|4.0|I believe that the book is very interesting to read, and I enjoyed reading it. The Author, Malcolm Gladwell, brought some interesting studies that discuss human being's inborn ability to determine things beyond common judgment. Gladwell presents diverse studies to show us people's ability of making critical decisions depending on that inborn ability (blink). Although Gladwell elaborates on how snap judgments can be good or bad in our lives, he failed to elaborate on how to differentiate between the good and the bad intuition before making any judgments.   The decisions that were made using people's inborn instincts can have negative outcome. For example, Gladwell discusses a case study about Cook County Hospital, which was about curing heart problem patients in a really poor medical environment. He mentioned that 250,000 patients with no medical insurance come through the hospital every year and the hospital does not have enough man power and resources to cure all those patients properly. The interesting part is that the doctors in hospital were treating patients using their gut feeling with minimal laboratory help, which gives totally inaccurate results and could lead to someone's death. These experts are able to make such decisions because they have been doing the same kind of treatment with different people for years, and their judgment is probably more than just intuitive. Their little mistake can cost a persons life. At the same time, Gladwell discusses on how snap judgments can be bad. In cases of racial prejudice for example, the cops who shot Amadou Diallo were shooting an unarmed man who at first glance looked liked a criminal to them. Since there is no way of knowing what out instinct tells us is wrong or right, it is better to not make snap decision and react towards it.  On the other hand, blink of an eye decision can make you do the right decision. For example, on the Getty Statue case, Hoving knew that the statue was not genuine as soon as he saw it while the scientists wasted 15 months to figure it out. At the same time, General Paul Van Riper defeat his opposing team in the war using his instinct while his enemies were using satellites to fight against him. Even though intuition can lead you to a good decision, after all it is just a gut feeling and there in no way to answer why we felt that way and there is no way of knowing if it is correct. If you can not explain why you felt that way then there is no reason why someone should believe on what you have to say.   Finally, after reading the book, it is clear that blink judgment can be useful and/or wasteful. Gladwell failed to point out on how to differentiate between the good and bad snap judgments. The book left me hanging with questions like; how could somebody know if the judgment about to make is good or bad? How can you make a distinction between good and bad snap judgments?
B001TODCII|5.0|It's rare to find a film like \\"Taken\\" nowadays.  In a world overcrowded and over-saturated with action films, \\"Taken\\" may appear to be simply another \\"run of the mill\\" style of films found within the genre.  However, this assumption couldn't be any more wrong.  The truth is that \\"Taken\\" is a truly deep, emotional, and inspiring film that depicts what one man is willing to risk, and do, in order to save the ones he loves.  The story is well developed, and the characters are easily likable, making the film that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />The film revolves around the tale of ex CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who is currently working as a security guard for a major musical star by the name of Sheerah, a pop star singing young woman.  Taken as a joke, initially, by the woman, Bryan quickly redeems himself after fending off a would be assailant who attempted to assault Sheerah with a knife after her performance.  To thank Bryan for his help, Sheerah agrees to assist Bryan's daughter Kim in vocal lessons.  However, when Bryan attempts to tell his daughter of the good news, he is never given the chance to speak since Kim is more excited about the idea of her and her friend Amanda traveling to Paris.<br /><br />Reluctant at first, Bryan agrees to let his daughter leave, under the circumstances that she contacts him as soon she gets there.  Breaking her promise, Kim does not call her father upon arrival in Paris, but instead her and Amanda decide to go get ready for a party that a young man just told them about.  Kim gets a call from her father who is angry that she did not call him back, in the midst of their conversation, Kim witnesses Amanda being kidnapped from within the house.  Bryan walks Kim through the steps to try to stay safe, but ultimately he realizes that the kidnappers are going to get her no matter what.  Before she is taken, he tells her to shout out as many details about the men's appearance as she can.<br /><br />Bryan tells the men that he will find them, and that he will kill them, and using his skills he has acquired from the CIA, he does just that.  Despite being hundred of miles away, Bryan is capable of piecing together pieces of the crime, establishing a trail to the men responsible for the kidnapping.  The film depicts all of the actions that Bryan must undergo in order to save his daughter.  Using his talents in the field of investigation,  he learns the reasoning behind his daughter's abduction, as well as the source.  He learns that due to the circumstances, he only has a few hours to retrieve his daughter, this quickly turns the film into a race against the clock, as Bryan only has a few hours left to save his daughter, or risk never seeing her again.<br /><br />The film's story is deep and emotional, allowing the audience to feel Bryan's pain and suffering and his pure devotion for his daughter Kim.  His actions make the film a truly amazing action movie, utilizing hand to hand combat as well as weapons to overcome obstacles, yet never feeling too over the top, but rather sticking to more believable acts of human strength.  Utilizing stealth, and cunning and well thought out plans, Bryan is capable of overpowering his enemies at every turn, even when things look extremely grim for the man.  \\"Taken\\" is a film that shows the power of love, the determination of a father, yet still contains the necessary formula and scenes that are required to make a great action flick.  Rather than sinking as low as other action movies that rely more on action sequences and less on storyline, \\"Taken\\" finds a great balance, making the film truly worth watching.ll kill them, and using his skills he has acquired from the CIA, he does just that.

B003YBNRHU|2.0|I could not agree less with these glowing reviews. As a life long Doobie fan, I find this a gasp at what once was - and it misses by a wide margin. All the songs, all the riffs are predictable and repetitive. There is absolutely no spark, it sounds forced and rushed - an labored attempt at being mainstream. Both Tom and Pat's voices are shot, I don't hear any originality in at all. All these stories and stanzas have been done a hundred time, with 99 of them being better. Save your money and buy the Live at Wolf's Head DVD instead - and see and hear what the Doobs are suppossed to sound like - not this margarine tightrope of doobies as old men trying to hang onto a dream and remain relevant. Sorry - hard review to write as I was so looking forward to this release. Buy any Doobie album over this - any one but this!

038533348X|5.0|I read this book years ago and reread it recently.  It is excellent.  In truth, Vonnegut was sporadically a very good writer, but not a great writer.   This is  his very best book, and the only one that has stuck with me over the expanse of time.   He himself gave it an A+, while being objectively hard on most of his other books.      Its fun,  its thoughtful,  its a fast read.   And it stuck with me over 30 years to be one of the very few books that I wanted read a second time.    That proved to be a good choice.    I recommend it to the many others out there who read Vonnegut years ago,  and to the young readers who never did.
0811876373|5.0|The beautiful book is hard cover and spiral bound which allows it to lay flat so you can easily see the recipes. The photos are large and colorful and there are over 40 cake pop recipes. They range from holidays (like stunning Easter eggs, beautiful blue sparkling Hanukkah pops, and Christmas trees) to occasions (like wedding and graduations), plus other extras, like animals (cute koalas and monkeys).<br /><br />My children loved how the movie popcorn cake pops use mini marshmallows for the popcorn, and they also loved the adorable pirates! My favorite pops are the boy and girl pandas (my daughter tells me they are dating!), with their heart noses and blue bow on the girl made with two hearts and a circle! No one can walk by the book and resist the urge to leaf through it with all the fun ideas! (See a few of the pictures from the book below.)<br /><br />In the book, Bakerella gives the basic methods techniques for the cake pops, plus recipes for cakes and frosting. She also offers display, storing and shipping tips. In addition, there are frequent tips highlighted throughout the whole book.

B002ZG99CC|1.0|Man I miss the old days of the 80's and 90  like movies like karate kid, blood sport,, kick boxer and rocky fighting movies today are just crappy animated fighting that looks so fake like this movie when you see kids jumping 10 feet in the air and doing back flips it just looks so cheesy. And also I think Jaden smith was total wrong for this part they should have had a kid with a kung fu back round or something ,but since it is Hollywood they do that kind of stuff, but what makes fighting movies in the 90's so great  is the fighting looks real and easy to do and gives me motivation to become a fighter, they make it look so easy like van Damme, and Dolph Lundgren.  in this movie it makes it look impossible and dose not give me any motivation to become a fighter.

He did not want any part of this movie like he said the plot was weak and it was not about the money to him.
067960085X|5.0|\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" (1959), Truman Capote's classic novella, is a story of innocence, love and sadness in the person of an enigmatic young woman, Holly Golightly. Set in the years of WW II, in New York City, tne story is told in the words of a nameless male narrator and an aspiring writer whom Holly refers to as \\"Fred\\" after her soldier brother. Both Holly, going on 19, and the narrator reside in a brownstone apartment building on the East side of Manhattan and live bohemian lives.  A third primary character of the story is Joe Bell, a stoic, Tums-chewing bachelor bartender on Lexington Avenue who is a common friend of Holly and Fred.<br /><br />For all its brevity, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany\\" is full of detail and subtle characterizations of its protagonists and its secondary characters. The story is beautifully structured, as it begins with the chronological end of the events it relates and only gradually unfold's Holly's story and character. Capote's language is precise and highly rhythmic.  Not a word is wasted. Norman Mailer described Capote as \\"the best writer of my generation\\" based upon this little book.<br /><br />Holly is a girl of uncertain background when she and the narrator befriend each other.  She dreams of finding love, wealth, and a true home.  She receives money from wealthy male admirers, and she also becomes emeshed with a gangster named Sally whom she visits in Sing Sing once a week.  Holly carries enigmatic, coded messages from Sally to one of his associates. Ultimately, she is arrested as an accomplice to Sally and is forced to flee.<br /><br />Holly is a mix of vulnerablility, innocence and wildness. \\"Never love a wild thing\\", she says at a key point of the story in explaining why she declines to become pinned down.  Wildness and freedom receive great play in the story.  At an earlier point, the narrator admires an expensive antique bird cage large enough for several parotts. Holly buys it as a surprise Christmas present while she makes the narrator promise never to put a bird in it. Holly too flys away at the end. Search and freedom are not ends as Holly looks for a love that perhaps she never finds.<br /><br />Although Capote writes in a terse, fast-paced style with little introspective commentary, his portrayal of Holly Golightly reminded me of Henry James's portraits of American women. The styles of the two writers are markedly different. Yet both James and Capote in this book share a certain view of American women in their innocence, independence, and surface toughness.  For her apparently footlose, sensual lifestyle, Holly values love above all.  She shares her favors liberally and is rewarded, but she disaproves of prostitution because it is not an honest expression of feeling. The story expresses something archtypically American. At one point, Holly tells the narrator:<br /><br />\\"I've thrown away my horoscopes. I must have spent a dollar on every goddamn star in the goddamn planetarium.  It's a bore, but the answer is good things happen to you only if your're good.  Good?  Honest is more what I mean.  Not law-type honest -- I'd rob a grave.  I'd steal two-bits off a dead man's eyes if I thought it would contribute to the day's enjoyment  -- but unto-thyself-type honest.  Be anything but a coward, a pretender, an emotional crook, a whore: I'd rather have cancer than a dishonest heart.\\"<br /><br />\\"Breakfast at Tiffany'\\" can be read quickly, but it is a book that will repay several close rereadings. I wanted to read this book for a long time but never did, possibly because I was put off by what I knew of Capote himself.  It was my loss.  So too, I regret not seeing the famous movie with Audrey Hepburn loosely based upon Capote's story.  Some things are best experienced when young.<br /><br />This is a masterful book with a lead character, Holly, who has deservedly become an American icon.<br /><br />Robin Friedmannarrator promise never to put a bird in it.

0739367676|5.0|If you want to make your drive to work or out running errands a joy then buy this audio book! I have been listening to the whole series as I drive to work and run around town and have loved it. It might take a while to get used to Bella's voice...but one you do you will love it too! And I really like the guy they got to read Jacob's book, he does a great job and I have finally been able to enjoy and giggle at some of Jacob's sarcastic comments. I definitely recommend these audio books for any twilight lover.
0316077054|4.0|The first book \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" was long, confusing and, at times, overly trite. I read \\"Beautiful Darkness\\" because the reviews looked more positive. It was better and I wonder if it's because Ethan is the center of the story and Lena is literally not in the picture.<br />I never read reviews with the plot explained, I prefer what people have to say about what they read. So, this book is written more clearly, leaves out the high school nonsense from the last book, and Ethan remains a strong and loyal character. He cares about Lena and wants to find a way they can physically be together. He loves his family and is loyal to his friends.<br />But, Lena becomes stranger than in the last book and makes bizarre decisions that would have left most guys running into the arms of the new librarian in Gatlin  (I liked her). Most guys would have said \\"screw it\\" and moved on. He doesn't and I felt for him. His feelings are well written and made me remember my high school broken heart.<br />There were parts of the book that were just too convenient: Leah (who?) showing up in time, Amma showing up when needed (twice), and oh, the importance of that little black ball was just too silly.<br />I am however looking forward to the next book because of Link. No spoilers here, but I like what I read.<br />I'm rooting for their relationship, because I am a softie and I adore Ethan. But,  Lena does need to become more likable. Otherwise, I'm going to start rooting for Team Liv.
044024238X|5.0|While I've found that all of Kinsella's heroines are cut from the same ditzy cloth, Samantha skyrocketed to the top of my favorites before I had even reached the second chapter. This fish-out-of-water gal who starts out not knowing how to boil an egg or sew on a button proves herself to be a real pro at winging it, sizing up the insecurities of her employers and even finding time for romance. Although there are the usual snippets of predictability, this book was a giggle fest from start to finish and I loved it.  Christina Hamlett  Author of Movie Girl
030745455X|5.0|Excellent story that just won't let you put this book down.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  A lot of characters to keep track of but they are all interwoven into a suspenseful story that piques your interest throughout.  In my opinion this was the best of the three books.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|First saw this movie last winter when HBO released it.  I managed to catch it a couple of times then and enjoyed it both times.  I was watching for it to be released on DVD and ordered it as soon as I saw it was available.  Have since shared it with some of my family and they also loved it.  This is a real upbeat story that will make you feel good about watching it.  It sheds a new light on Autism and makes you more understanding and appreciative of those struggling with it.  Claire Danes is terrific in the title role.
B0047C9Y9K|1.0|I have really tried to like this show, but episode 3 finished it for me.  Why in God's name would any sane young woman want to become a scientist when 'Bones' has to caper around in a skeleton suit and red tutu?  At least the science guy (while presented as kind of an idiot) got a lab coat.  The writers must hate science, or women, or both.
B001J8NQFI|5.0|I don't think we need another review of London Calling after 30 years, but I did want to comment on the Blu-Spec CD.    On my mid-grade system, and to my ears, it does sound marginally better than any other CD of London Calling I have heard since 1986.  There is additional clarity to the recordings with some additional depth and (perhaps) emphasized bass.  It IS mastered loud, so don't expect an 80's-type digital mastering, and make sure your volume control is handy!    I do not think that anyone who has experience with well-mastered SACDs or DVD-Audio discs will think this sounds better than either format, but since this seminal title is not available on either of those, this is the best 44.1/16 we have.    Yes, these discs are pricey, and while I wouldn't rush out to replace my 1,000+ CDs with Blu-Spec, London Calling is my favorite album of all time, and I can live with the price for this version.  Highly Recommended, but only if you really love the title.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, with its stellar cast and deep (I thought) subject matter. Instead I got a soap opera that's about two hours too long.<br /><br />The talented actors, especially Ben Affleck, are wasted on a trite love story, and the war itself takes a back seat to melodrama. The battle takes up about ten minutes of the movie, with the rest of it \\"which guy will this girl end up with?\\" I was thinking \\"Who cares\\" by the time the film finally ended.<br /><br />I give \\"Pearl Harbor\\" two stars for its stunning sets, costume design, and re-creation of the period.<br /><br />Amazon guidelines limit my final statement. I find this film's attempt to cash in on an American tragedy to be of questionable taste. (60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition???) Please remember that this was a national tragedy in which real men lost their lives.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|To all the haters and complainers who have written in--let me just say this ok?  If you don't LIKE the stripped down version--don't play it.  Just 'imagine' that you bought the digitally remastered DF for $12.99--certainly a fair price for this seminal classic and Lennon's coda, whether he wanted it to be that way or not.  For me, and most Beatle and Lennon lovers this is just absolutely beautiful!!!  It gave me chills to listen to John's voice; knowing he was gone and has been for a very LONG time.  I closed my eyes and was back in 1980 again just for awhile; remembering when I bought the LP the day it was released and playing it over and over again.  John was BACK from 5 years of playing house-husband!!!  He still 'had' it; the songs were matured and so lovely.  If you can listen to some of these, like \\"Beautiful Boy\\" and not get tears each time something must be wrong.  To think that a 5-year old boy grew up with that song instead of his father is poignant, sad and very real but reassuring for Sean I am sure.  What John might have accomplished if he had lived longer--this only hints at what might have been and at least we have it to cherish.  I'm sorry folks; this is VERY REAL for me, the Beatles were the greatest band ever and their songs and the solo ones that came later are the soundtrack for my life.  I still have my tickets from the 1981 tour John was supposed to make for Feb 1981 in DC.  John--so many of us loved you and what you and the rest of the Fabs gave us to treasure as we 'grow old' along with our generation and loved ones.  God bless you and your family, the rest of the Beatles and their families; and thank you ALL from the bottom of my heart and soul for the songs that I can always go to when I need to hear them.  I cannot 'imagine' a day without them!!!
B003Q6D25K|5.0|Ok, heres the problem I have with people criticizing this movie, they didnt vary that much. All the people who trolled the review sites with the first one trying to be creative with the dialogue to their empty insults no longer have a leg to stand on because they knew what to expect. It wasnt a sequel where you could say they ruined the first one, like Scream, it was a literal elaboration of the first movie. This one had just as much to offer as the first one, they just divided it up into different portions. The casual scenes were funnier and contained dialogue actually worth listening to which served as a misdirection to further dramatize the effectiveness of the scary scenes. They put more shock value on the individual scenes, then slowed the pace of the movie which ultimately led to a higher anxious anticipation of what was to come. Each explosive scene in the second completely outdid that of the first. And while in the back of your head you kinda knew how it was gonna end, it was just so messed up that you refused to believe it until you actually seen it. The ONLY reason the first had a chance at being scarier is because you werent familiar with the story yet. They put way more of an explanation to the story and somehow managed to do it without being cheesy. If you didnt like the first, then avoid this. But if you like the documentary horror genre then you should definitely check it out.
B0042816YK|5.0|In 2006, a woman named Elizabeth Gilbert wrote a book called Eat Pray Love: A Woman's Search For Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia. This little book depicted her search for balance, and a better life. It was endorsed by the almighty Oprah, and therefore, millions of readers across the country, and across the world have been enlightened by her everywoman approach to spirituality, religion, and what needs to be done to live your best life.    And, four years later, the film version is released. Naturally, Julia Roberts was selected to play the lead role. And, let me start out by saying, I was a huge fan of the book, and Julia Roberts was NOT who I had in mind to play Gilbert. I saw someone like Kate Winslet, or Anne Hathaway in the lead role. I thought that with Roberts playing the lead role, the story would be transferred from a deep, spiritual journey, to just another Julia Roberts movie.    I was pleased to discover that I was wrong in these thoughts. Julia Roberts is a fabulous actress, and like any fabulous actress, she makes you believe that this part couldn't have been played by anybody else. She embodies the role, it's obvious that she spent months, perhaps even a year, getting into character. She is so reminiscent of the Elizabeth Gilbert character. After watching this film, it's clear that she was the obvious choice for the role.    In the film, Liz Gilbert (Roberts) is a seemingly happy married woman. She has everything a modern American woman is supposed to want: husband, beautiful home, great friends, terrific job, etc. She discovers that that's not all it takes to make one happy. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), and starts to date an actor (James Franco) from a play that she wrote. She finds a beautiful human connection with him, but realizes that even he's not what she really needs.    She breaks it off with him, quits her job, and decides to take a journey around the world, that would last one full year. This journey would start inItaly, where she would get in touch with her abandoned love for food, then moving to India, where she would find religion, and then to the Indonesian island of Bali, where she would try to find love again.    A colorful array of supporting actors make this film what it is. Viola Davis plays Gilbert's BFF Delia, who is tragically underused, but she is a kind of voice of reason for the wishy-washy emotions of our heroine. Javier Bardem was the obvious choice to play her Indonesian lover Felipe, who has undeniable chemistry with Roberts. Richard Jenkins plays a man who Gilbert meets in India, who acts as sort of a confidante to our main character.     The heart of this film, however, lies in the breathtaking cinematography, and beautiful soundtrack. Director Ryan Murphy, of Glee, and Nip/Tuck fame, treats this better than he did his previous adaptation Running With Scissors. It's directed with love, and it follows the book as well as can be expected. He fits alot of gorgeous architecture, and beauty into the massive scope. Each frame is a postcard, and makes the viewer long to take a journey like this at some point in their life. It also is very resonant on an emotional level. It makes you believe that even the most cynical person can find happiness if they allow themselves to.     In the end, this isn't a romantic comedy. This isn't a chick flick, it isn't even a `Julia Roberts movie', it's a loving adaptation of an admired memoir. It will surely satisfy fans of the book, as well as fans of Julia Roberts. But, you don't need to be a Roberts fan to appreciate what this film has to offer. Its message is universal, beautiful, and breathtaking. See it.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'm joining the Kindle boycott. I was able to read a hardcover copy from the local library for free. With all the hype I was really looking forward to reading this on my new Kindle. It is a big heavy book and would have been perfect on the Kindle.    It is a great story and I would otherwise have given this 5 stars.    But, the pricing is greedy. Apparently whoever set the price didn't read the book.    Book readers and socialists unite: Support your local library on this title.
1400064287|4.0|As I started to read Made to Stick, my mind automatically went to The Tipping Point, a book I read not a long time ago. In that book, the stickiness factor is mentioned as one of the agents of change. So I was eager to explore how Chip Heath, Dan Heath would explicate it in their book.   The main point of the book is that if you want to be successful you want people to remember your ideas and be impacted by them. According to Chip and Dan Heath, there are six principles that create sticky ideas: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional and have stories in them.  Our ideas should be simple and understandable by everyone. Complicated things tend to confuse people and that is one reason why most ideas are forgotten. In order to keep things simple, we should find the core of the idea we want to express and get rid of everything else. It should be something similar to the commanders intend in the army. Southwest airline has done this successfully by having a simple motto: \\"We are the low-fare airline\\". Everything in the company's business is done in function of this simple idea. Employees are flexible to do their work in different ways without jeopardizing this goal. Proverbs are an excellent example for of simplicity. They are compact and meaningful and they have survived for centuries.  Humans use schemes that help them predict the future. When something unpredicted happens, we find ourselves surprised that our schemes did not work. Scientists have discovered that the function of surprise is attention. As a result unexpected ideas have a higher chance to stick because surprise makes us pay attention and think.  Abstract ideas are hard to understand and remember. If we make them concrete we avoid this problem. The specific ideas have greater impact than the general ones. We could say that \\"there are 100 animals in this farm\\" or \\"there are 100 cattle on this farm\\". The second one is more likely to be remembered. Once Friedrich Nietzsche said:\\"The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more you need to seduce the senses to it.  Credibility is also very important. If you want your ideas to be remembered by people you want them to be credible. Credibility is achieved in two ways. The first way is through external credibility. It means that an expert in the field of the idea you want to transmit supports your idea. The second way is through internal credibility. This means the idea is supported by examples, credentials or statistical data.   Emotions towards an idea make people act. There are three ways which can help us create emotions to our ideas. The first way is by using the power of association. We form an association between an idea that people care and an idea they don't care. The second way is to appeal to self-interest. We should find what the people we want to transmit our ideas to like and appeal to those things. The third way is to appeal to identity and understand how people make decisions.  Telling stories is a powerful way to make people act. Stories provide simulation and inspiration. When we hear a story we simulate everything in our mind and it tells us how to act in different circumstances. Stories also inspire us and fuel us with energy to act.  I found Made to Stick very interesting. Having our ideas stick to the others is very important for us to be successful in our society. Although we may know most of the notions this book describes, it has put everything in order and has made is so easy for us to understand how to make our ideas acceptable.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|I happened upon the Script in summer 2010 due to Pandora and my love of Gomez and Indie Rock in general. I was immediately HOOKED. Their sound is unique, upbeat and a lot of different melodies. The depth of the lyrics are outstanding and this album is just as good if not BETTER than the first album. I was one of few who got the album early and was able to see them Live at the Fillmore in SF, two weeks after its UK release. For the First Time has nothing on \\"Nothing, This = Love, Dead Man Walking and Walk Away\\" You will not regret buying this album in its entirety!

0385338910|5.0|Mr. Tropper's book has heart. It's no simple task for an author to successfully manage the heartbreak of unexpectedly losing a loved one, insightful observations about the nature of grief and very funny episodes. Once again, Mr. Tropper delivers. I came to truly enjoy the quirky aspects of each character. The protagonist, Doug Parker; his twin sister, Claire; their younger sister, Debbie; their mother and father, Parker's angry step-son and a handful of emotionally mixed-up extended family members were all wonderfully fleshed out. Like Mr. Tropper's three previous books, he seems to be getting better with each new novel. The author has an ability to handle very serious emotional topics and, yet, use humor to relieve the tension. After reading his, now, first four books, the author has become one of my go-to-guys when I need a surefire winner. A great book.

The grandaughter of the deceased knows that it is a sting operation and Langdon is the prime suspect.  Sophie and Robert run through Paris and London, unraveling clues while staying ahead of the authorities.<br />There are very few people in America who haven't heard of Dan Brown's best-selling thriller The Da Vinci Code.  The \\"conspiracy thriller\\" is based on the premise that the Church (meaning the Catholic church) has surpressed critical, non-Biblical facts about the life of Christ.<br />  If you claim that Jesus was married and had a child, you will get flack no matter how many copies you sell.<br />The Da Vinci Code is a well-spun mystery (I hesitate to call it a thriller) that makes big claims backed up with almost completely phony research.  Even liberal reviewers gave Brown a hard time.  When attacked by historians, Brown affirmed that every thing in the book was fact.<br />  I've gotten different opinions from Christian who have read the book or seen the movie.  Some feel threatened, but Brown's dull axe, if you will, is only a threat to those unwilling to research.  The majority of Christians I've talked to enjoyed the story and left the theology.<br />  The final word?  Read if you are willing to do some extra research.

0375842209|4.0|I am a high school English teacher, and I read this with students in my after-school book club. For this age range, the book is perfect. However, I would venture to say that it's an incredible read for anyone.     Here's what I loved:  1. This book gives an atypical account of the Holocaust. My students' experiences with Holocaust novels and memoirs deal mostly with the Jewish perspective. In the eighth grade, many of them read _The Diary of Ann Frank_, and in the tenth grade, they read _Night_. This book is written from the perspective of Death, the narrator, about a young German girls' life during the Holocaust. I wish all my students would read this because many of them assume that most of the Germans were just bad people. It gave us a chance to debunk those assumptions and discuss why many people didn't speak out against Hitler. At the same time, it highlighted the prevalent prejudice that many people harbored for the Jews.  2. Zusak is a gifted writer. I enjoyed how he played with the imagery in this novel (the senses are often mixed in an unexpected way). His descriptions were creative--I found myself highlighting several poignant passages so that I could go back and read them again. His characters are real in a way that I haven't found in many other \\"teen\\" novels.   3. The chapters are succinct, which is helpful especially for teenagers. I also appreciated this because I read it on my Kindle and it's hard to tell how much of a chapter you have read. I never had trouble finding a stopping point (if I wanted to find one at all).   4. The narrator notes that he doesn't like mystery; therefore, he gives the reader the outcome of the chapters up front. Ironically, this creates more suspense, in my opinion, for the reader.     Here's what I felt it lacked:  5. With all the time the narrator (Death) spends describing the souls that he collects, I expected much more than just one sentence about Hitler's soul. I was waiting to hear how black and heavy and grimy it was, but I got nothing. My students shrewdly noted for me that it was because Hitler was human just like everyone else and that Death didn't have any special regard for most humans (except maybe Liesel). Therfore, I accept this omition :)  6. The ending seemed rushed. I know, I know--the book is 500 pages long; however, I felt that the last few chapters simply skimmed events rather than developing the same kind of touching description like the rest of the novel. Not that I necessarily wanted Leisel's entire life story, but I felt cheated a little bit.

0316069485|3.0|WARNING - I WILL REVEAL SOME PIECES OF THE PLOT IN MY REVIEW - DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED!    I am a long-time Michael Connelly fan, and have read all of his work.  For several reasons, this book is probably the biggest disappointment of all his books to me:    1) Mickey Haller is too boring and predictable to be both the main character and narrator of this book.  First of all, he comes off as unaffected and one-dimensional.  Even when the book is at its' climax, Haller is home staring out his windows with little thought or insight.  Secondly, Haller's ex-wives are far more interesting than he is.  I wish Connelly had spent more time on the thoughts and actions of these two intriguing women.  Haller seems basically inept without his ex-wives running the show.  Finally, Haller just totally lacks the intense moods and fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants attitude that Bosch has.  Yawn.    2) I agree with several other reviews that there is basically no character development in this book.  Skip right on through to the next Bosch/Haller book and you won't miss a thing.  At the end of \\"9 Dragons,\\" Bosch's one-bullet love Eleanor Wish is killed and his daughter, Maddie, comes to live with him.  I was hoping/expecting to get more inside scoop on how things are playing out.  What is Maddie thinking and how is she adjusting?  Has Harry given up the women to be a better father?  What is going on???  Please?    3) The books jumps all over the place with no warning.  I felt like some of the chapters ended on the crux of an exciting twist or breakthrough, and then the next chapter would fast-forward to the next morning (or next week!) without rounding out what happened.      4) I miss Rachel Walling.  She is a fantastic character and I am still not totally sure where her loyalties lie.  I wish Connelly would bring her back in; the profiling parts of his books are a highlight for me.  I find forensics and profiling to be fascinating, and I wanted Connelly to give her a bigger role in the \\"The Reversal.\\"  I felt like Connelly was just shuffling through the past with characters and not developing them or moving forward in any other way.    5) The ending.  It sucks.  What are we supposed to do with that?  Is there going to be a sequel?  Why was Jessup stocking up on canned fruit?  Did he do it or not?  WTH?    I am giving the book 3 stars because I liked the plot line, and couldn't put the book down while I was reading it.  However, the ending left me frustrated and feeling like I wasted my time and money.  Hopefully, this is going to be Connelly's one bad book and he will be back on his game for the next one.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|I don't want to say a lot about this film other than to say that it is incredibly underrated right now, and I'm really sad to see it did so poorly in the box office. It took a funny, nerdy, action movie to places where no one else has gone, not sure why this movie didn't catch fire because everyone I took with me to see it loved it, but if this film doesn't become any kind of cult classic, I'll be double-disappointed. It functions on the level of a big Hollywood picture without selling out or trying to go easy on the audience, and even if you don't outright get everything that's happening, it's incredibly entertaining if you're willing to meet it at the completely-not-serious level that it's purposefully functioning on.<br /><br />This movie gets tagged with the 'nerd' 'hipster' 'just another cera movie' title and its really unfair. The whole cast did fantastic and although it was Cera's 'usual' type of character, the plot is COMPLETELY different than anything he has ever done. Battling and epic fight scenes. It was truly awesome and also very funny. I will get this the day it comes out.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I've used a Polar 625 for many years but wanted a GPS unit for pacing accuracy plus the map.  The 405CX is a great GPS unit but I've been very disappointed in the quality of the watch as well as its general useability.  I hate the wheel - after the first couple of uses in winter before I learned how to lock the display I nearly grabbed the thing off my and stomped it.  My long sleeve running jacket rubbed the touch sensitive bezel and TURNED OFF THE GPS.  Plus once it gets wet you can't do anything with it.  Sorry, but this sucks.  And the \\"8 hour\\" battery, a joke.  I left the watch in my running bag for I think, three days, and then when I went for a long run on Sunday, after an hour the thing died.  Come on, its been sitting unused for a couple of days and the battery has been discharging?  I'm eating the $300 and buying either a 305 or a 310.  Highly do DO NOT RECOMMEND the 405CX.  Oh and I forgot to mention I've had to send this unit back TWICE because of internal fogging.  TWICE IN ONE YEAR.  Two new watches.  Now the warranty is up.  If it fogs again its into the river.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Yes, this movie has CGI and action. And that's about it. I felt the story just lacked in any credibility whatsoever. And if you're going to do fantasy/sci-fi stuff, then let's bring in a good story behind it. The whole narrative part doesn't work... see Fight Club for how 1st person narrative makes the movie interesting.     I'll say this, the movie was interesting at first. I wanted to see him train and get to know his powers and get revenge. But once the training started, that's where they lost me. It didn't make any sense, how they trained him. Lots of BS posturing and very secretive. We're just going to torture you and that's how you'll learn BS. And it was really over the top gore and violence.    Others have said this is like Matrix and some even suggested this is better than the Matrix. I disagree. It's not like the Matrix. The Matrix actually had a story behind it. And it was compelling. And it got cooler as it went along. This movie was not any of that. I suppose the best thing about this was the CGI. And even that was meh.
031236198X|1.0|Usually a fan of short easy to read concept books, Our Iceberg is Melting is definitely a disappointment given the outstanding work that John Kotter does in the area of change and change management.<br /><br />A fable, ok- but if you need to keep interrupting the story with the obvious such as penguins don't have arms, they can't smile or other human non-penguin like traits, perhaps another animal or mammal or even human should have been chosen.  The constant references to the fact that we need to use our imaginations was a huge distraction.<br /><br />Even the section of the book titled \\"case for the book\\" (pgs 139-146) is put together better then the entire rest of the book.  At least there, he is describing the need for change in a manner relevant to the readers who would be interested in a book on change.<br /><br />The author is correct in that \\"fables can be fun\\" but this one missed the mark.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Whilst already an avid Eagles fan of many years, I thoroughly enjoyed both discs and will continue to do so for many years to come.

However, they are so good live that it was a pleasure to watch the DVD's as the quality and content was so good, a really well put together DVD.    This was as close as actually being in Melbourne as one could get.    I cannot recommend it too highly and even non-Eagle fans will really enjoy it.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is not your typical movie based on the zany universe of comic book heroes and villains.  It is a film which dispels the veneer of the public icons and reveals the truth about social outcasts.  Joss Whedon has managed to create one of the most lovable anti-heroes to date.  Whedon somehow encourages us to want Dr. Horrible to succeed.  Though Dr. Horrible is meant to be rotten to the core, he reveals his good nature at times and a desire for social change.<br /><br />What makes the experience enjoyable, is that this deep topic is conveyed through the medium of humor.  The words of each song not only make you laugh but cause you to marinate on what is being presented.  The lyrics are further enhanced by Neil Patrick Harris' brilliant delivery.  The man manages to pack so many conflicting emotions in every note and truly reveals Dr. Horrible's dual nature.<br /><br />The good performances do not end with Harris though!  Felicia Day's portrayal of Penny emanates the archetype of the real \\"do-gooder.\\"  Her character is excellently juxtaposed by Nathon Fillion's despicably self-righteous Captain Hammer.  Even the minor appearances by Whedon's colleagues were a joy to watch.  Its obvious that everyone brought their A-game to the set.<br /><br />As far as the DVD itself, its full of extras that raving fans of the movie will love.  Commentary may seem like one of the last features one would visit when going through the extras menu but certainly not in this case.  You'll even get to hear the Whedons belt out a few tunes about the making of the film or each other.  Another bonus feature I recommend checking out is the Evil League of Evil auditions.  It showcases some of the awesome creativity of the Dr. Horrible fans out there.<br /><br />All in all, whether you are new to Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog or a long time admirer, this DVD is certainly worth the purchase.
B002N4DZ26|4.0|If you peruse the many reviews for this celebrated recording, you will deduce that by and large most people acknowledge this a great account but with certain caveats - hence my reduction of one star for what is still a seminal set. Opinions differ about most key aspects, but virtually everyone agrees that the young, pure, thrilling voice of Lucia Popp is near ideal as the Queen of the Night, even if Klemperer's steady beat restrains her from sounding as hectic and off-the-wall as the best modern interpreters, such as Diana Damrau. Most enjoy Gundula Janowitz's similarly ethereal-toned Pamina though others call her \\"cool\\"; I find her poise and pathos make her as ideal in her role as Popp is in hers. Berry's bluff, rich-voiced Papageno is clearly an asset, though once more, Klemperer's reverential approach eschews the emphasis on comedy and in word-pointing he must yield to Fischer-Dieskau for B&ouml;hm - one of this singer's most successful assumptions and, unlike his forays into Verdi or Wagner, entirely within his gifts. Klemperer has an extraordinarily starry array of supporting voices which include many who were, or became, leading singers in their own right. The sound is superb, even for 1964 and the playing and singing of the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus exemplary.<br /><br />We get into more controversial territory with the remaining issues: first, Klemperer's direction. He clearly adores the piece and although he is by no means always exceptionally slow, he is weighty; the vertical far outweighs the horizontal hear and God's voice speaks through the clouds. That's how Gottlob Frick should sound, but in truth by this later stage of his career he labours and groans under Klemperer's measured beat, even if his authority and warmth are not in doubt. The other bugbear for me is Gedda's Tamino; he cannot hold a candle to Wunderlich for B&ouml;hm, often sounding throttled and bumpy. Others praise the beauty of his singing; it is true that, as so often with this singer, he is good in parts, but very unsteady at other times and his tone is essentially bleaty. He is especially unsatisfactory in that sublime passage just before Tamino plays his flute, \\"Wir wandeln durch des Tones Macht\\" - gritty and unsteady; just listen to the beauty of Wunderlich's line for a comparison. I do like Gedda in some things but we do not find him here in finest voice.<br /><br />So B&ouml;hm wins for his male singers and sense of fun; Klemperer for the supremacy of his women artists and for the combination of majesty and affection he brings to the music. There is nothing monolithic, for instance about his handling of Papageno's magic bell music and \\"Ein M&auml;dchen oder Weibchen\\"; it is quite charming - but he is also able to invest the stern Bachian fugue of the armed men with a transcendent quality. Even in Mozart's most deceptively simple melodies, Klemperer touches sublimity. I love the warmth and directness of B&ouml;hm's set and could never part with Wunderlich as Tamino, nor am I as bothered as much as some by the inadequacies of Roberta Peters and Evelyn Lear for B&ouml;hm - so it's both sets for me. If you want a modern version with dialogue - missing here, but included in B&ouml;hm's recording - I suggest a super-bargain outsider: the 1991 version conducted by Mackerras on Brilliant with some first-rate singers in a lively performance.he is good in parts, but very unsteady at other times and his tone is essentially bleaty.

B003TVMIDO|3.0|Well, well, well...oh well...!    This is, by far, the newest and most recent Lennon release from the Yoko factory.  (Sean's gotta eat!)    In either case, if you liked John's music you MUST GET THIS!!!    The thing about John's trend toward the end-- that is: including Yoko on every other track back when most people did not have the option of excluding certain, say, \\"less desirable\\" songs from a collection by programming a player-- made you realize was how fortunate we were that Paul (that HIGHLY over-rated and unworthy of all of his fame and glory lesser Beatle whom John carried between 1961-1970) McCartney did not do the same with Linda.     Nonetheless, if you LOVED John then you MUST ALSO LOVE YOKO (just ask any of the remaining Beatles or anyone who was around them in those halcyon days).  By degree of separation, you MUST ALSO LOVE SEAN, and all he does, but DISLIKE Julian, as Yoko did not like him.    Anyway, I distress...buy this and you will get the same music you already have BUT as a new release and in a box you do not yet have!  Oh, and that ART PRINT!  Can you say \\"Co-llect-a-ble!!!\\"        However, just in case you have not heard, in a few months Apple and Yoko will be releasing these very same releases, but as 24-bit tracks (!!!) in a USB (!!!) and they will all come housed in a LIMITED EDITION ACORN shaped box!!!  If you do not GET this metaphor to the Apple Box you shouldn't be even reading this.    The sound on THOSE releases are guaranteed to be even CLEANER, and CLEARER, and CRISPER, and SHARPER, and will \\"jump out at you!!!\\"  Yes they will, as these merely, oh, say... \\"hold your hand!\\"     The BEST thing about the Acorn box will be that it will be a VERY LIMITED edition!!! So get it FAST before other people do.  I have it from a very credible inside source that Apple and Yoko have only authorized 10,000 of them.  However, of course, if those are all sold Apple and Yoko will likely, for the saki of their fans, probably release ANOTHER, LIMITED EDITION 10,000!  But, you cannot count on it.  AND, my inside source also whispered the rumor, in passing, that this SECOND limited edition of 10,000 MAY (note \\"may\\") include a private code that you can log into a secret site where you will be able to DOWNLOAD (!!!) a version of one of John's songs that is NOT in ANY of the legitimate releases!!!    Gotta have 'em!!!    So, get this taster, and stay tuned because this, my friend is a REVOLUTION!!!
1439133948|3.0|Lois Bujold's strengths are, as usual, on display with this book.  Her strong characterization is on prominent display, with the two characters we know a bit older and more mature, but still the comfortable characters fans of the series have grown to love.  The new characters, primarily Jin, are well fleshed out and believable, and we quickly come to care for him.  The returning minor character(Raven Durona) gets a good fleshing out.    Ms. Bujold's fascination with medical/life technology and it's effect on society is once again on display, and once again she creates an interesting society based on those changes.  How would easy, convenient cryogenics affect society?  This is something that could happen before long, and it could have a large impact on society.  While the scenario she paints in this book is far fetched, it does a good job of illustrating the kinds of things society will face at some point.    The story is fun, the action exciting, the humor laugh out loud.  Pacing is perfect.  So why does it fall short?  Well, to be honest it really doesn't, except in comparison to her own earlier work in the series.  The first thing to note is that except for Miles and Roic, the rest of the large cast of characters we love to read about simply are not there, or only there briefly.  No Cordelia, no Aral, no Ivan, no Simon, no Alys, no Gregor, no Ekatrin, no Pym.  Mark and Kareen show up, but briefly.  This is very frustrating to longtime fans, as [art of the pleasure of the Vorkosigan books is seeing how all those characters grow and interrelate.    More importantly, while the story is fine, it's not up to the standards of most of Bujold's books.  The plot feels disjointed at times, and it felt as if she had a great idea's on the themes to tackle, but just was going through the motions on the story itself.  It's not a bad story, but I expected better as she has shown herself quite capable of writing much better stories.  And I think that is the biggest problem withthis book, that Ms. Bujold has spoiled us, and we almost expect too much.    I sincerely hope that she does revisit the Vorkosigan universe again, and in much less time that it took her to do this book.  I just hope that we see some of the old characters(especially Ivan, who does deserve his own book), and she returns to the form she is capable of.  I do recommend this book to her fans, and to those who have not yet discovered the joys of the Vorkosigan books.  It's not bad, it just could be better.

B00000IHHM|5.0|Being a big fan of Riccardo Cocciante, I had heard some pieces from this musical and had been looking for the CD.  Happily I saw some clips on Youtube from the original French production and was impressed by the cast's talents.  So when I found this CD with the original cast I snapped it up.  The quality of the CD and pieces are outstanding. Anyone who is a fan of musicals will love it.  If you need a translation, the youtube clips will provide it, and you'll appreciate the wonderful story line even more.

B002QGUFWE|1.0|Our generation is so in love with its own sense of irony that moreso than any previous decade, we can actually grow conscious of the fact we are being forcefed slop, we just don't tend to care. Our lives have failed us, but maybe we can feel as if we're \\"part\\" of something if we do what's fashionable. What we think defines us will turn our soul into plastic.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Every song is different and every one could be a hit single. I bought it for the NY song but found all of them were really well written and performed. Alicia Keys has the talent and will be this generations star. Great album! She should get a Grammy for this piece of work.
B003VIW8DK|4.0|Bryan Ferry's new CD \\"Olympia\\" is a star-studded affair, with supermodel Kate Moss gracing the cover, Brian Eno, Nile Rogers, Flea and David Gilmour on guitar, a song co-penned with Scissor Sisters, as well as a collaboration with Dance outfit Groove Armada.<br /><br />Opening pair of \\"You Can Dance\\" and \\"Alphaville\\" are stylish Pop songs with woozy flourishes, not far removed from an earlier song of his like \\"Don't Stop The Dance\\". \\"Heartache By Numbers\\" is the Scissor Sisters co-write and is a dark number with gently pulsing synths. \\"Me Oh My\\" is an absolutely gorgeous piano ballad with echoey harmonies and haunting effects. My favourite.<br /><br />\\"Shameless\\" is the collaboration with Groove Armada. It appeared earlier in the year on Groove Armada's \\"Black Light\\" album in a clubbier bass-heavy version. The treatment here is lighter with piano flourishes but still danceable, a nice alternative. The ballad \\"Song To The Siren\\" is a Tim Buckley cover. \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" is a woozy ballad with a tint of Country. \\"BF Bass (Ode To Olympia)\\" injects some Funk/Soul into the mix for a seventies feel, \\"Reason Or Rhyme\\" is an enchanting piano ballad, and closing is \\"the quivery Tender Is The Night\\", a spare swirling ballad that finds Ferry asking \\"Is this the end? Let me know,\\" in his nervy tenor.<br /><br />Beautiful!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|A delightful series complete with favorite actors from lots of period movie favorites.  Characters were enjoyable as was the plot. I was hooked from the first episode. I know some have commented that it was slow, but I felt it moved about the same pace as similar movie favorites (like [[ASIN:B00140PK6O Cranford]]).  If you're very particular about what you watch - stick with this season and skip season 2 and 3 which decrease in believability and quality. Season One can stand on it's own as enjoyable entertainment.
B0042816YK|3.0|I thought this was a good movie. I thought it had a good message, but my friend was so moved by the story. She seriously was boo-hooing in the theater! Then she sat in her car afterwards and cried more. lol So I think it's all in who needs to see a movie like this. I am always soul searching. I know how to be in touch with my feelings and nature/god. So it was uplifting, but it didn't really move me to tears. :) I'd reccommend it though.

B003L5LEYW|5.0|Some pairings don't always make sense on the surface, so when I heard that Nas teamed up with a Reggae legend, I wasn't sure what to think of it. The outcome, though, is an incredibly uplifting and musically fulfilling experience. Lyrical genius and production mastery collide on this album, and it goes down as one of the top 15 of all time in my albums collection. It's THAT good.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|There will never be another \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", but that doesn't mean the sequel is inherently bad.    I found the music to be just as romantic as in the original. There are many soaring romantic ballads, and in spite of some tedious lyrics, the sound of this musical is beautiful.    I've listened to the CD multiple times and now even enjoy some of the songs I disliked at first (\\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\"  \\"Look With Your Heart.\\" Other songs  I loved immediately:  \\"Til I hear You Sing Once More\\", \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\", \\"Love Never Dies.\\"    I've seen a number of  LND songs/trailers on Youtube, and the look of the play is lush and haunting. Sierra Bogess is a gorgeous, sweet Christine; Ramin Kamirloo is a handsome brooding Phantom. If I lived in England, I'd have seen this play once or twice already.    Sierra also has a beautiful emotive soprano voice. I think she's a better Christine than Sarah Brightman (who was a good singer but terrible actress). Kamin Ramirloo is perfect as the Phantom; he sings with dignity, pathos, and intensity.  You can feel the hypnotic-like hold he has on Christine through his voice.    Like many others, I found the final death scene to be intolerably long.  The scene  should have been wrapped up within 30 to 45 seconds of Christine dying.  Instead, things went on for at least another 2-3 minutes, making me wonder what the heck was going on during that time.  In contrast, the final minute and falling of the curtain in \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" was  succinct and perfectly timed.     All in all I'm glad I purchased the CD and I hope to see the play someday.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Killer Klowns from Outer Space was not much of a hit when it was released in the 80s, but it's taken on cult status over the years.  Why?  I think just the absurdity of the idea.<br /><br />Clowns hold a special fear for lots of us.  They are recognizable as human, but the grotesque make-up and costume disturbs our idea of what humans are.  I suppose it's like the trouble that robot makers are having.  If you attempt to make a robot as life-like as possible, it just seems really, really creepy.<br /><br />Combine the weirdness of clowns, the strange atmosphere of a carnival midway, and the familiar items turned weapons (cotton candy, pies), and you have a strangely compelling film.<br /><br />The whole thing works because once you accept the initial absurdity of the idea, the whole premise is consistent within itself.  The movie is played straight; there is danger and suspense (of a sort).  And the special effects are good (not great).  The klowns (should I call them that?) are well done indeed; they look like the worst nightmare of a six-year old who is terrified of clowns.<br /><br />Recommended for the humor and the campiness of the film.  It's three-and-one-half stars of pie-throwing fun.  John Vernon is the only recognizable face in the film.

0345472322|1.0|She says the same simple basic stuff over and over again. Common sense stuff. Its not so black and white on everything. Growth mind set vs. fixed mind set. Yawn, yawn, yawn. I soooooooo wish my boss had not made us read it. Wasted time I could have read enjoying other books.    \\"The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People\\" is much, much better than this repetitive thing...     \\"Be curious! Believe you can learn! Don't give up! Have a good support team! Use it! Take risks! Don't be afraid to fail!\\" And on and on and on . . . That is the growth mind set. And the fixed mind set is simply the opposite of those things.    Another book that is much, much better than this one is, \\"Influencer: The Power to Change Anything\\".
B000024E9M|4.0|I got this 2008, Import remasterized version of \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" (Dutch edition), after my 1994 U.S. issue 'got lost' (How? I really don't know...).<br /><br />Find it having a very good sound, even when the colors of the cover are quite different from the LP original cover, having a slightly 'greenish' tone.<br /><br />Anyway, I like it a lot not only for the extraordinary good sound quality (I usually listen music in a very simple table-top 4-speaker Sony equipment, more than enough for my ears), but also 'cause it has no \\"Bonus tracks\\", then respecting the original LP edition.<br /><br />Even the CD labelled layer reproduces the 'FAMOUS CHARISMA RECORDS' LP label, that one with the characters of 'Alice In Wonderland' (the Rabbit, the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat)... Very nice detail!!!!<br /><br />And frankly speaking, this album has one of the Genesis themes I like the most: 'I Know What I Like (In your Wardrobe)'... I heard if for the first time in a British-edition LP back in 1974, and I still go crazy for it! Great Peter Gabriel voice!!!
B00005JOFQ|2.0|According to a famous dictum of Henry David Thoreau, most men lead lives of quiet desperation. In the highly successful film Brokeback Mountain, based upon a short story by E. Annie Proulx, and directed by Ang Lee, the men who exemplify this proposition are a pair of cowboys who pursue a frustrated and frustrating affair over a period of several years. In 1963, while tending sheep in the Wyoming back country, two young men, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) end up sharing a tent one cold but frenzied night, during which Ennis anally penetrates Jack. The two men's lives subsequently diverge and both marry.     While Ennis' marriage unravels when his wife becomes aware of his attachment to his buddy, Jack moves to Texas and, after sleeping with the daughter of a wealthy businessman, marries her and gets a comfortable job working for daddy. Nevertheless, the two manage to continue their liaison until Jack demands that Ennis live with him. The latter refuses, relating a traumatic experience he had had as a child when an older man living with his friend was beaten to death. When Ennis some time later sends Jack a postcard, it comes back marked \\"Deceased,\\" and the movie suggests his lover may have been the victim of a similar act of violence.    The performances by Ledger and Gyllenhal are the movie's strongest asset. Otherwise Brokeback Mountain is a far from exceptional film. Compositionally mediocre, Lee's production lacks visual imagination, alternating between kitschy panoramas of the great outdoors and dreary views of small towns, gaudy saloons, and the cluttered dwellings of Ennis and Jack. Where Lee's earlier film Eat Drink Man Woman (1994) had a vividly depicted setting in Taipei with sharply observed characters, this movie seems to be taking place on the other side of the moon. Ennis and Jack no doubt deserve a better fate, but so does the audience.    The movie falls back upon one of the most durable if dubious myths of American culture: the redeeming power of nature. In the great outdoors nature itself sanctifies the union still unblessed today by the powers that be in the United States. But the tradition was always ambivalent: if the frontier, whether terrestrial or aquatic, tolerated certain kinds of otherwise taboo male relationships, it conveniently quarantined them at the same time. And a price always had to be paid whenever this transgression crossed the border back into civilization. Brokeback Mountain remains faithful to the tradition by killing off Jack and condemning Ennis to a life of celibacy.    Brokeback Mountain is a gay cowboy movie, right? Not at all. The movie portrays a homosexual relationship, but it leaves the question of the sexuality of the two men up in the air. Although Jack is shown as a bisexual philanderer whose escapades may have caused his death, Ennis remains a sexually enigmatic Rock of Gibraltar right up to the final fade out. Jean Renoir said of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, \\"It's supposed to be about homosexuals, and you don't even see the boys kiss each other. What's that?\\" In this movie, the cowboys do a good deal more than just kiss, but they never manage to put their desires into words. What's that?                 Many years ago, homosexuality was often euphemistically referred to as \\"The love that dares not speak its name.\\" After 1969, the year of Stonewall, few people would have any longer used the phrase except with ironic contempt. But in an odd way Brokeback Mountain makes that cliché come literally true. Ennis and Jack are sympathetic characters, but in the way the film presents them, they come across as inarticulate clods. Throughout a long movie the two men directly address each other a handful times.     It is only necessary to go back to the 1950s to grasp what is woefully absent from the film. Let us imagine that the movie could have been made at that time with a screenplay by Tennessee Williams and with Elia Kazan as director--a playwright who often depicted outsiders and a director with an incredible talent for transferring such figures to the screen. Without a doubt, the two men would have been pouring their hearts out to each other from reel one. Characters like Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront or Cal in East of Eden are hardly intellectuals, but they express themselves quite effectively--even eloquently at moments.    This inarticulateness is quite coherent with the way the movie presents the course of love between the two. Their first encounter is simply wordless, without even being preceded by any of the locker room banter about sex common among straight males. When the two couple in the middle of the night, it is as if God had sent a plague down on them that they can only passively endure. Just to underline the point, the next day Ennis discovers a wolf has killed one of the sheep, an omen of the fate that awaits them. Here we are far away from the still quite realistic territory of Williams and Kazan and closer to celluloid Transylvania where characters become werewolves overnight after violating some taboo. Following the discovery of the dead sheep, I nearly expected Maria Ouspenskaya to show up as a gypsy fortuneteller and see a pentagram on Ennis' chest.    Brokeback Mountain allots Ennis and Jack their moments of fleeting pleasure, letting them kiss and even romp about in the nude, but they end up paying for these moments many times over, just like any pair of adulterous lovers in the old days of the Production Code. By contrast, in From Here to Eternity (1951), James Jones introduces a secondary character, Bloom, an Army boxer who is Jewish and a closeted homosexual who blows out his brains in the barracks. Bloom reflects his own internalized hatred for homosexuals of the men around him, but he turns that reflection into an act of violent defiance, not passive submission to the status quo.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This was a great series to watch!  I watched all five seasons within 2 weeks because it was so good I just had to see what was going to happen next!
0307454541|1.0|This book was awful.  Slow beginning, mediocre mystery and once the mystery is solved the book keeps on going for another chapter or two.  A pointless ending to the book, should have ended with the mystery.  The original title of this book \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" or something similar was a very fitting title.  It truly should be called \\"Men Who Commit Sex Crimes\\".
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love this show! The leads have such great chemistry and the supporting cast is wonderful as well. The characters are developed well and you can't help but feel for them. I was glad that they decided to take some time to develop the supporting actors as well.  I'm glad that they made both of the lead characters a little vulnerable and not perfect individuals. Both of the leads have quirks.  This is definitely not just another cop show. It is good that they added a little comedy in to make it different from other police shows. Life can be very hard sometimes and it is great to be able to watch this show and relax.
1439133948|5.0|This is a shiny new book, and that in itself makes me happy.  PLUS: Yes, it is true.  The hardcover edition comes with a CD that contains ALL Vorkosigan books up to and including this one, except for my favorite: Memory.  On the CD are versions to read in html, epub, mobi, etc... Also speeches, interviews, cover art... this is amazing.    Premise: Lord Auditor Miles Vorkosigan and Armsman Roic are on Kibou-daini to investigate a sketchy business venture that one of the cryofreezing corporations based there has planned for Komarr.  Complications ensue, as usual.    I liked this book, and was slightly sad that I did not love it.  I do want to emphasize that I did enjoy it very much, and had it not been for sky-high hopes, I would probably have loved it without reservation.  This is the double edge of having authors that you trust to be great: you can be disappointed if they're not amazing.    Many of the Vorkosigan books are About something, with a capital \\"A\\", but not in that annoying way that I remember from grade school.  Memory is about life changes, and unexpected paths.  A Civil Campaign is about love and romance, Barrayar is about motherhood.  Cryoburn is about life and death; children and old age.     The planet Kibou-daini is obsessed with cryofreezing, and they put almost all of their populace in cold storage before they die in the hopes of future cures or longevity treatments.  This, combined with some unorthodox voting policies, creates some interesting political problems and a nasty series of monopolies running most everything.  It's a really neat setting.    Where this book shines brightest is in the character interactions.  It's been 7 years in-world since the last book, and Miles is almost 40.  You can feel him, not slowing down, but changing, settling a bit, with age.  His interactions with other recurring characters speak to their shared history, almost to the extent of repeating old jokes. It doesn't always make for scintillating dialogue, but it feels real; people gently reference their past adventures with each other, and give into a bit of nostalgia now and then.       This runs the risk of feeling like old hat to those of us fans who are familiar with the entire series, but mostly I think Bujold rides the line well. The only place I think she goes too far is in the tangent about Taura, and I know she had to leave that scene for those same fans.    The other two main characters are (20-something) Armsman Roic, last explored in Winterfair Gifts, and a young orphan named Jin who befriends Miles, giving a spectrum of ages in the viewpoints.  Miles' children (4 total, plus step-son Nikki!) are almost entirely off-screen, so to speak, but a presence nonetheless.    I absolutely loved the beginning chapters, but felt that the plot wandered a bit through the middle.  I look forward to reading it again, now that I'm not racing ahead to find out what happens, just to enjoy the writing.  It probably won't be one I re-read and re-read, though.  In the scale of this series, I'd put it in the lower middle: above Ethan of Athos, Falling Free, The Vor Game and Brothers in Arms, right below the level of Cetaganda and Mirror Dance, maybe?
B003UESJJC|5.0|Born out of creative chaos; Francis Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (1979) is both one of the grandest and most personal films ever to be released by a major American Studio. In this writers opinion, it was \\"last gasp\\" of large scale personal projects for the American Filmmaker, an era which abruptly ended with the release of Michael Cimino's financially and artistically disastrous \\"Heavens Gate\\" (1980). Coppola shot over 1 million feet of film over a period of one year with post production taking yet another year, which led to much speculation about the film being a disaster. Needles to say, it wasn't. This one-of-a-kind film remains, powerful, exciting, horrifying and intensely beautiful. This new Blu-Ray disc is an essential purchase. Both the original an \\"Redux\\" versions are included along with some amazing extras, not the least of which being the feature length Documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" A Filmmakers Apocalypse. Presented for the first time in 2:35:1, the film has never looked better. - Joseph A Cacace

B003WTE886|5.0|I broke down and ponied up for the Deluxe Edition CD from the big red bullseye store just so I can answer some burning questions:<br /><br />CD VS. DOWNLOAD - WINNER: CD!<br />Speak Now wins the prize for best CD packaging and booklet of the past decade (pricey box sets and reissues excluded). What you get: an embossed cover and an 18 page booklet filled with eye-popping color and some of the best photographs you'll ever see of Taylor. She playfully creates scenes from the songs - the damsel in distress on the train tracks gets the most press, but Taylor breaking up the wedding is the most hysterical. Plus - you get the rare shot of Taylor with straight hair. 2 pages of liner notes written by Taylor, lyrics - and a stellar shot of Taylor and her full band. Plus, the CD wins for superior sound. This brings back memories of bringing home an album on vinyl and having hours of artwork to pour over while listening to the album over and over.<br /><br />STANDARD EDITION VS. DELUXE - WINNER: DELUXE<br />I'm not a big fan of pricier deluxe editions. Why exclude people from some of the content? Wouldn't it be better to encourage first-week sales by making all first-pressing CDs deluxe and then making it a collectible by taking it out of print. Afterward, making ALL the bonus tracks available for purchase online. But I digress - this is one of the most action-packed deluxe editions I've ever purchased. You get a different color dress on the cover; six bonus tracks (3 new songs, two acoustic versions and a remix). Of the new songs, Superman is a sure-fire radio hit. The others are simple and wonderful and would have fit in nicely on the album. The acoustic versions are nice but don't stray too far from the originals and I'd be hard pressed to notice too much difference between the Mine remix and the original version (a Victor Calderone club banger remix it isn't). As for the video content - who would think a half hour documentary about the making of a 3 minute video would be so captivating? It was one of the most enjoyable half hours of TV I've seen in years - despite the fact I thought the \\"enhanced CD\\" was a technology that died in the 90's. Best parts of the docu: Taylor getting attacked by bugs, Taylor coaching kids to act and the local Maine townspeople all but shutting down the shoot. Wait til you see how Taylor saves the day in the row boat.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Would Taylor Swift be so universally adored if she wasn't so adorable? Probably not. If you disagree, name one ugly pop star since the dawn of MTV - let alone CMT. Sure she's no stranger to the occasional flat note of off-key chorus, but thanks to the miracle of studio-wizardry anyone from T-Pain to Britney Spears can have a hit record these days. What sets Taylor apart is she proved you don't need to sell sex to sell records; you don't need to be on major label to top the charts; you don't need to be old to write songs that are universal tales about the human condition; you can be a role model without being a hypocrite or a prude; you can be a celebrity without being a train wreck - and most importantly for the sake of this review - you can pack 14 singles onto an album without a single dud. No filler here. This would have made a good soundtrack to summer, but we'll have to settle for it warming our hearts and tapping our toes all winter long.

B0000009TT|5.0|What a thorough exploration of the scope and breadth of the music of Frank Zappa!  I saw FZ in 1971 with Flo & Eddie at SUNY at Stony Brook.  In 1973 with Jean Luc Ponty at the Hollywood Palladium.  Finally at the Roxy later in 73/74?  Missed him since then and recently read Barry Miles superb bio on FZ.  It reminded me of how much I enjoyed the music so I got Lather, Hot Rats, One Size Fits All, Absolutely Free and Live at the Roxy. I had much of these on vinyl.  These were a good sampling of the best of FZ.  Interesting quote from liner notes.  In heaven Jimi Hendrix sits at the feet of FZ.
B002Y5FKUE|5.0|I've seen this opera at The Met(not at the opening night, though), and was shocked to read about 'booing' of this production. There was certainly no booing at the performance I attended. There were 5-10-15 minutes screaming ovations after each duet/aria. Natalie Dessay and Juan Diego Florez are at their incomparable singing/acting best here, chemistry between them is amazing. Yes, the production is not as perfect as  Laurent Pelly's La Fille du Régiment, but that one was a rare gem, you can't expect things like that come out every year, can you?  The plot of La Sonnambula is so old-fashioned and ridiculous, it won't be plausible no matter how elaborate your sets are. It's not quality of sets and costumes that make production good or bad, it's a brilliance of singing and acting.  And here Mary Zimmerman fully succeeded. 'Condemned' in several reviews here, 'bed-spinning' scene is so full of passion, pain, frustration, you have to be emotionally dead not to feel it, and be amazed by it. There are too many magical moments of true art here to list them all. Check out a recent DVD of I Puritani, if you are such a fan of traditional staging. Sets are magnificent, costumes are beautiful, but it's all as dead as ashes. And even as great as always performance by Juan Diego Florez can't breeze a life into that production. You would still enjoy listening to I Puritani, but for a real opera experience, watch this imperfect but sincere and full of life production of La Sonnambula!

B004132HZS|5.0|I was never a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes stories. I have occasionally enjoyed some of the film adapatations (the Downey/Law movie was fun) and the mystery series featuring \\"Mary Holmes\\" is great.    Then I tuned into Masterpiece Theater Mystery last night, out of habit, willing to give a try to anything they present. And WOW.    It was the best hour and a half of TV I've seen in a long time. As the other reviewers here have mentioned, Sherlock is outstanding in every way....casting, dialogue, action, sets, story, etc.    Holmes is a self-described \\"high-functioning sociopath\\" who pairs up with Dr. Watson, a war vet not totally adjusted back to normal life. This first adventure (Study in Pink) establishes that they will be partners in adventure, not master-flunky.    I found myself smiling as I watched. I started out fascinated. Became hooked when Sherlock, needing to explain what is so obvious to himself, muses \\"what goes on in those tiny brains? It must be so boring.\\" I was thoroughly addicted by the closing view of Holmes and Watson striding away from their first adventure.    Bravo BBC! for this unique twist on an old classic.
0439023513|5.0|I was talking to a friend of mine a couple weeks ago.  I had turned her on to the Hunger Games series and she was complaining how she'd lost a couple Saturday nights to finishing each of the first two books.  We were discussing the books a bit when she said, \\"they're clearly young adult fiction\\".  I agreed, but I got to thinking about this as I read this third novel.  This one, I thought, is not quite so clearly young adult fiction.<br /><br />After the Hunger Games redux of the end of Catching Fire (which I feel is the weakest part of the entire series), Collins gets back on track with Mockingjay.  In fact, she goes deeper and, in some ways, matures.  In this story of the rebellion against the Capitol, we move away from the simple brutality of the Hunger Games to the more complex brutality of war.  Everything works on multiple levels--is Katniss a figurehead or powerful? is she justified in pursuing revenge? what horrors will the rebels accept to be victorious?<br /><br />Of course, everything that makes the previous books work is on display here too.  There is plenty of action.  There are a number of well-drawn characters.  (Katniss is great, certainly, but as I've been reading the first book again with some students, I feel more and more that Peeta is the real conscience here--a feeling confirmed by this book.)  And I really approve of Collins' willingness to maim and/or kill off major characters.  The excitement level is raised once you realize that no one is really safe.<br /><br />Though in some ways the ending of the novel is predictable (including the Harry Potteresque epilogue), Collins does have a few surprises up her sleeve as the series comes to a close.  It really is a satisfying conclusion.  In fact, I would judge this to be the best, most assured book of the trilogy.
B002Q1YDLI|2.0|I enjoyed the first book quite a bit. It was a fun lighthearted read and I was looking forward to reading this book because I loved the idea of reading Darcy's side of the story. The first half of the book was fun albeit slightly annoying since the character of Darcy is somewhat annoying and pathetic. But then comes this rapid shift in the book where she \\"becomes a better person\\". It was such an abrupt switch/ a quick 180 that it hardly seemed believable and that's where the book went downhill for me. For 1.5 books the character Darcy was so utterly horrible and then somehow after one straight talk she gets it together and becomes a better person. I don't buy it and feel that there are many little moments in both books that the author could have set up so that the change in Darcy was believable. Something Borrowed is worth reading. Something Blue is not.
B003WTE886|5.0|As a fan of Miss Swift, I've been anticipating this album for months. I pre-ordered Speak Now through Amazon, and received it this morning. Immediately it found it's way to my computer's disc drive, and it hasn't left since, four hours later. This is, without a doubt, one of the most diverse albums I've ever heard, and it clearly shows Taylor's progression as a writer and artist. To say I'm impressed would be a gross understatement. The substance and maturity of the songs on this album is what strikes me more than anything. My favorite tracks, if I had to select a few, would be \\"Enchanted\\", \\"Sparks Fly\\", and \\"Innocent\\", the infamous song written about Kanye West, however let me stress that there are absolutely no filler tracks on this album, every single track is radio friendly, and more than enjoyable to hear on a consistent basis. Thank you so much Taylor for the gift of Speak Now, you speak now from you heart, and we hear you loud and clear!
0316066524|5.0|On the off chance that someone sees this review, which I doubt anyone ever will, I'll say this: it took me three weeks to read this book, and I enjoyed the hell out of it every one of those 21 days.  I got up in the morning and read it for an hour before work, I read it at the gym, I read it at night when I had time.  A lot of reviewers don't like the \\"experimentalist\\" aspects of this book, and I wouldn't either if it wasn't such a good story.  I was fully immersed in the world the writer created.  I worried about the characters, or admired them. I relfected on my life and how it related to the story.  I saw deep insight into what it's like to be alive today, to have relationships, to have grace, to fall from grace, redemption, uncertainty, the whole kit and kaboodle of great writing.  I really didn't like it when I finished.  Not because, like so many other readers, I couldn't hack the ending.  No, I found the way it ended to be exhilirating. I was just sad there wasn't more to read after I'd finished.
1401309666|4.0|I should first say that this is a most readable book which is not necessarily just interesting for those involved in business, but is an eye-opener for people from all walks of life. A reviewer here criticizes the book for repeating itself, but if you read any book outlining a new theory that's exactly what most of these authors do - demonstrate the application of their theory in a number of different contexts. However, there is one interesting aspect regarding the influence of customer reviews on selling products that Chris Anderson does not comment on, and it would be interesting to hear what he thought. According to a friend who works for an online marketing company, up to 50% of reviews for some categories of products are written by fake 'customers' who are in fact online marketers giving 5 star reviews to one of 'their' products, and under other names, one star reviews ripping the products of their competitors, maybe even creating imaginary worries about quality. Some online shopping platforms in Germany are reckoned by him to be mostly fake customer reviews. These can have a very bad effect on sales, as if it's an early review it can be very influential. It is true that for real niche products, only an insider could write a convincing review, and I believe that for some categories like books reviews will probably remain genuine as it would be too time-consuming for an online-marketer to do a convincing one without reading the book. As for rave reviews of books, CDs and DVDs on the day of release, who knows how many are real people, how many connected with the artist? Again, an early bunch of low star reviews can have as drastic an effect as a bunch of 5 star reviews. It's worth keeping in mind when reading customer reviews, especially of technical products, that despite Amazon's best efforts, some of them are certainly the work of internet marketers. I think a discussion of this danger and ways around it is warranted in the next edition.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|Spectacular!              It's closer than you can say about this new work from Phil Collins! At the first minute I felt something strange in the sound, expect a crystal clear sound, like all their albums, and felt some distortions that additional time be perceived as equal to the original arrangements! It was somewhat surprising, because only someone with the expertise of Phil could pull that off! After watching the DVD .. was there that I realized exactly said by itself! 03 things! There are 25 tracks, he and his record company were worried! For me it could be a double album! This album is a feast, a feast of emotions, joy, memories and I'm sure anyone in my age group, will buy it because it is a must! The second is, buy without fear, here in Brazil, I know all tracks, I'm an audiophile masters 50 and 60 years and especially this album is a gem! I even touched you. have recorded 02 of Carole King (One of the greatest exponents of rock). And the third is welcome on his return Phil, And with this one so special! I love you. face

0316743003|5.0|Ben Rich was born in 1925 in an upper-class Philippine Jewish family, which fled for the United States just before the Pearl Harbor attack; they lost everything but had more luck than Ben Rich's aunt, who survived a Japanese concentration camp. Ben Rich went to college at age 21, and got a master's degree in aeronautical engineering, despite his family's dreams of him becoming a doctor and his father-in-law's wishes that he inherit his delicatessen business. After the graduation he was hired by Lockheed, where he designed inlet ducts for the company's jet aircraft. In 1954, Clarence Johnson, the head of Lockheed's \\"Skunk Works\\" secret projects division, borrowed Rich to design the inlet ducts for the U-2 spy plane, expecting him to leave within a few weeks or months. Rich stayed at Skunk Works for 36 years, taking over the business from Johnson in 1975 and retiring in 1991. Under Johnson, Rich worked on some of the most amazing planes in the history of aviation: the U-2 spy plane, the SR-71 reconnaissance plane, for which he designed a unique engine - a turbojet that turns into a ramjet at high speed, and the D-21 drone. In addition to Rich's memoirs, the book also has stories by pilots of the U-2 and the SR-71; the Americans flew the U-2 over the Soviet Union and Cuba and the Nationalist Chinese flew it over the People's Republic. When Francis Gary Powers came back from Soviet prison, many Americans thought he should have killed himself instead of allowing himself to be captured; Clarence Johnson took pity on the guy and hired him as a test pilot. When Ben Rich became the head of Skunk Works, somebody brought to his attention a translated paper by an obscure Soviet physicist that showed how to calculate radar cross-sections; since this paper was written, computers had become much faster and it became possible to design an aircraft with a tiny radar cross-section. Ben Rich's team designed the F-117 stealth attack aircraft. They also toyed with a stealth catamaran and even proposed a submarine invisible to sonar, but the U.S. Navy didn't care about it. During the First Iraq War, only 2.5% of coalition aircraft were F-117s, but they struck more than 40% of the strategic targets, overcoming Iraqi air defenses. Now, if your country consumes too much foreign oil, you can set your top engineering talent on reducing the consumption of oil, or you can set it on designing an aircraft that would be invisible to the air defenses of one of the world's top oil producers in the case you go to war with it. Moral considerations aside, which choice makes more engineering sense?d even proposed a submarine invisible to sonar, but the U.S. Navy didn't care about it.

1439133948|2.0|Bujold's greatest strength is her characters, and this book lacked the nuanced personalities that keep me coming back. Roic is about as layered as an episode of Dora the Explorer, so I'd like to less of him, not more. The embassy staff, the damsel du jour, and especially the villains... all of them sort of flat and totally forgettable.     Where are the Tauras, the Ellies, the Ivans, and for the love of cheese, the Gregors? I want more Gregor. I wish that the author would make more of an effort to include the tried-and-true characters, rather than sending Miles off on his own over and over again, to interact tepidly with disposable one-offs. The next book (assuming there is one-- I get the feeling she is quite bored with Miles) should take place at home. Maybe Illyan can be resurrected from scenery status.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|I'll tell you why: Because a lot of fans find this sort of thing fascinating. That includes me. I'm not one who thinks DF was overproduced, but I was still interested in hearing a stripped down version. The stripped down version may not be better, but it's still a good listen, and it actually sort of freshens an album I'd gotten a little tired of hearing.  I would think that fans who may not be all that keen on a stripped down DF would still get some enjoyment out of hearing things that were buried in the original mix, or edited out of the original. And, the bits and pieces of John's previously unheard dialogue - are those not priceless? I think they are.  I say kudos to Ono and Capitol Records for making this release possible.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|The storyline I felt was alot different than what I have seen in past Robin Hood Movies and Books.  I thought there was going to be more stealing from the Rich and Giving to the poor.  Over all I thought the moview was pretty good.
B002SAUCBC|2.0|I have read 1000s of books and have rarely been disappointed. This story was a major disappointment. I will admit that it was an original idea for the time it was written but to be so invested in the characters and to simply end the story the way it ended was stupid. DO NOT waste your time. Go for a real walk and enjoy life! Hey King, you owe me $6.95 and 2 wasted evenings.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was very depressing and I didn't like the characters.This was a very disfunctional family.  Can't imagine why Oprah raved about this book.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Loved it..Ken Follett's research is impeccable. I loved his Pillars of the Earth and this book rates right at the top with Pillars.  The characters are fascinating, the time, (before, during and after WWI) the customs, the thinking are so authentic you would think you were right there in England, Russia, or Germany.  It also explains a great deal about why we had the war, the drift to Socialism, women's rights, and other social issues of the day.  This is one of the best historical novels I have ever read.  Recommend it highly.  Can't wait for the sequels.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I rented this from Netflix and watched it just to see what all the hype was about. I never expected to love it. It is sci-fi and enchanted-romance all in one. I loved the special effects and the looks of love that went between the Avatar the \\"the People\\" The tree of life on the HDTV big screen is so enchanting and beautiful with all the little pure souls floating around it.<br /><br />So I came to Amazon and got my own copy. The first reviewer is correct there are no special effects how we did it clips or trailers, bloopers on this DVD. I didn't care as it was the movie I wanted. Many times I never look at those things anyway.<br /><br />Even if you are not into this type of movie I think this has something for everyone. Romance, Fantasy, War, Fast Action, Special effects.<br /><br />I now use the saying \\"I see you\\"  more often. :)

0316010669|4.0|Recently, I watched the TV play of Lie to me, in which the expert can tell whether people lie just by a glance at people's faces. In the play, the expert learned a lot about people's expressions and psychology. With the abundant studies and experiences, the expert can tell what a person is thinking about by looking the person's expressions. In the book of Blink, Gladwell also gave a similar example about the theory of mind reading.   The book is mainly talking about making decisions by rapid cognition. It concerned with the content and origin of those instantaneous impressions and conclusions that spontaneously arise whenever we meet a new person or confront a complex situation or have to make a decision under conditions of stress. Gladwell took so many interesting examples in the book to describe how people make decisions instinctively in a short moment and what impacts the accuracy of our judgments.   According to the author, the book is to convince readers of a fact that decisions made very quickly can be equally as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. In addition, the book is to answer the question that when should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them. Moreover, the third and most important task of blink is to convince readers that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.  In the daily life, we have to make lots of decisions. Sometimes we spend a lot of time and energy to consider a lot to make sure that we can make the correct decision. However, we may finally make the same decision as we decided before the deliberately consideration. Or even worse we may find that our first decision is better than the decision made after the cautiously thinking.   For example, when I am doing multiple choices, there is a problem I'm not sure between option A and option B which option is the correct one, so I just pick A instinctively. When I recheck my answers, I begin to analyze the confusing problem: I'm familiar with the concept of option A and I also have impression of partial information in option B. After a carefully thinking about the options, I ultimately choose option B. However, after the examination, the teacher tells us that option A is the correct one.   It's interesting that the situation above always happens to many students. It seems that our decision made by the first impression often is the best decision. As the author said, sometimes we should take our powers of rapid cognition seriously. Although making decisions through cautiously consideration of large amount of information is a good method to determine things, the instinctive judgment can be a good way to make decisions. Since the instinct is based on our past experiences, we should pay attention to it.   By combining instinctive judgment and analytical consideration, we are more likely to make right decision. Besides, it's also important for us to learn how to simplify complicated information to solve problems because sometimes the more information we know the more confused we are.
B003WTE886|5.0|This CD is her best yet. By farrr! It is so amazing. Every song is a perfectly told story and no one can deny she has mad talent. Everyone should buy this CD. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best album of the year. Some people might not like her song Dear John because it is about John Mayer and they may think shes being a immature little girl but this is what she promised her fans. That she would be real. That song is real and is amazing even if it is about one of the best muscial artist out there. Yes i love john mayer but i know hes a douche when it comes to love everyone knows that by now! So go T. Swift you are nothing but amazing. buy this cd you wont be sorry
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Okay so I got the PX21 headset on a deal for ~$60 when it was like $80. The headset is amazing. The games sound great, and now I can play late at night without disturbing la familia. The only con I would say is that the ear cups lean towards \\"on-ear\\" rather than \\"around-the-ear\\" type. So after hours of use, my ear do hurt a bit. But that being said, the lightness of the headset make it very bearable for prolonged use. As for the wires, there's a lot! But that is not really a problem for. I would rather go for a wired headset than a wireless because of the quality of sound. Overall, this is an incredible buy for those wanting a headset.
0307463745|5.0|True, this book is short, and filled with pithy statements. If your idea of a good business book is how long it takes to digest, take a pass. On the other hand, if you pair this with Guy Kawasaki's \\"The Art of The Start\\" you have the scriptures for anyone who wants to start anything. Like all scripture, these are high level principals more than literal rules. Read, use judgement, apply. This is not a cookbook.
0345505387|1.0|I must say - this comic book ruined Jamie and Claire for me.  This comic was no way near the category of a \\"novel\\".  YUK.  On top of that, the drawings were horrible.  It was like looking at a super bad Superman in kilts comic.  The characters never even looked the same and I could not tell them apart from one scene to another.  I HURT to look at!   I thought that a graphic novel meant that a few drawings were going to be included.  You know, Diana's usual 500 pages of adventurous bliss.  Pretty exciting, huh?  So the opposite.  So disappointed.  This was not a book and certainly not anything close to DG's caliber.  I love to read books, not comics.  Why did Diana have to use our beloved Jamie and Claire if she wanted to create a comic book?  She so insulted them.  I had been so looking forward to reading the her next novel. Never thought I could not trust her. This comic was SUCH as disappointment and I am just dazed that Diana released it.  Take it back!

0439023521|5.0|I was just like Stephen King, I couldn't stop reading!  There is so much in this short novel, its stunning.  Katniss is an amazing character, who definitely has her faults but whom you can't help rooting for.  She is the typical American rebellion, but also picks her battles. Her main focus is survival for herself and her sister.  Love doesn't seem to even occur to her until very late in the game.  I loved the realism in this, I think the \\"tributes\\" (contestants) are very realistic, and if you threw 24 teenagers into a pit and told them the last man standing is the winner, the events in the book wouldn't be far off!  At times sick and sadistic, and other times hopeful and heartwarming, I definitely recommend this read!  5 stars from me!
0345409671|5.0|Since becoming a vampire, Lestat has brooded on the existence of both God and the Devil.  When a mysterious being begins stalking Lestat, he becomes convinced that the Devil is coming to take him away to Hell.  This is indeed the Devil, but he has come with an offer for Lestat; the Devil would like help against his adversary, God.  The Devil, Memnoch, will show Lestat Heaven and Hell and then allow him to make his decision whether or not to die and become Memnoch's lietenant, or to remain in his immortal vampire form.    This is my favorite of the Vampire Chronicles since Interview with the Vampire.  The descriptions of Heaven and Hell were amazing, and I loved hearing Memnoch's version about the reasons he is God's adversary and the situation that cast him from Heaven.  This is a unique and fascinating interpretation of these well-known Christian themes and was definitely thought provoking.  Well worth the read even though it is different than the other novels in the Vampire Chronicles.
B0038W0OHQ|1.0|I've had three different pairs of this headset.  The first pair I had was shipped with a problem where the microphone was catching the audio coming from the earphones. The people I game with said they could hear every single sound playing through my headset clearly. So I sent it back for a new pair.  The second pair I had lasted for a while. However, after about ten months of use, the audio on the right earcup stopped working altogether. As the headset was still under warranty, I sent it back in for a new pair.  The final pair worked well for about a month. But I started having issues with the left earcup's audio cutting out. I could fix this issue by readjusting the eacup until the audio resolved. Two months later, it failed altogether. And, unfortunately, as my warranty has expired, I cannot replace this now defunct headset.  For the price, the build quality is awful. I'd expect this from a $30 headset, not one well over $100. Do not waste your money. It's nice that it has a warranty and everything, but you're better off getting SteelSeries' own Siberia model or something from Logitech, Turtle Beach or Roccat.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|Okay, first let's get the obvious out of the way: Yes, the time travel aspect does tend to lead to confusion and, perhaps, the occasional plot hole or two. That said? My motto is simply, \\"Go with it!\\" Do not analyze, do not try to make the illogical, logical, and enjoy the journey of the characters and their romance.<br /><br />The characters referred to, as is known by now to many, are Dr. Kate Forster, played with a low-key grace by Sandra Bullock, and architect Alex Wyler, son of a more famous architect who still battles past demons thanks to said father. Keanu Reeves has been often called wooden, but I think he did an excellent job in this movie. I could sense Alex's antipathy towards his father and his loneliness and longing for Kate.<br /><br />You all know the story: Kate Forster begins the movie by leaving the lake house, an odd, yet visually stunning house, for a place in the heart of Chicago to be nearer to her work at the local hospital. On her way out, she leaves a letter for the next occupant to forward her mail should she receive any.<br /><br />Alex gets that letter, positive Kate is mistaken: No one has lived in the lake house for years. Come to find out, Alex lived at the lake house *before* Kate. Somehow, some wrinkle in time has allowed Kate and Alex to correspond through a mailbox. What starts as pleasant chatter and jokes soon deepens into love, as the characters share their hopes and frustrations with the other.<br /><br />A charming scene takes place when Alex \\"takes\\" Kate on a tour of Chicago and leaves her a message spray painted on a building. With Alex's profession, architecture seems to be a nice backdrop in the film as much as the time travel element is.<br /><br />Over time, Kate and Alex long for each other. Kate even tells him of something she had lost two years prior. It is then he gets his first glimpse of Kate in his time. He finds what she wanted, too. Kate also manages to help Alex in a time of despair by sending him a book fromher time that puts his relationship with his father into perspective.<br /><br />The romance is jeopardized before it even really can begin, however, by an event early in the film. For those who have not seen the movie, I won't say what it is. But time proves it is no match for love when Kate tries to give fate a hand and prevent the inevitable.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves once again prove their chemistry in \\"Speed\\" was no fluke. It is just as evident here. Perhaps even more so, as the context of the film's openly wistful and romantic nature augment the chemistry. Each brings out the best in the other. Also great is Christopher Plummer as Alex's emotionally unavailable father and renowned architect, Simon Wyler. Ebon Bachrach as Alex's brother, Henry, also played off of Reeves well, and their familial bond was believable. Dylan Walsh also appears as Kate's on-and-off boyfriend, Morgan.<br /><br />Another thing that makes the movie and helps set the wistful, languid mood is the music. Rachel Portman's score is simply magnificent. And the \\"popular\\" tracks are appropriate, as well. I adored Paul McCartney's \\"This Never Happened Before\\" and the song that opens the movie, the somber, but ethereal \\"(Can't Seem To) Make You Mine\\" by The Clientele. I highly suggest buying the soundtrack as well as the DVD and/or BluRay.<br /><br />In short, a lot has been mentioned about the movie's implausible premise, but to quote Roger Ebert in his review, \\"Never mind that!\\" I adore this movie. I loved the romance, the hope, and yes, even the loneliness. And the dog playing Jack added a cuddly touch, too. This is not the typical chick flick. Neither is it one of those rom-coms or romantic dramas that rely on a lot of hot sex scenes. While I do like some movies of that vein, this is refreshing in its simplicity. It's almost a \\"throwback\\" kind of film to the romance genre.<br /><br />Put the analyzing away for a couple of hours, watch the characters and their romance unfold,and enjoy this film at face value. It is truly a slow-paced, but entirely enjoyable and romantic fantasy escape.<br /><br />And there's nothing wrong with that!
B003EYVY04|2.0|Like many, I can't express enough my disappointment that they decided to create the rest of these ultimate editions without the extended versions of the movies.  The Prisoner one is probably not that big a loss-- there was very little to add to an extended version whey they did them for TV.  However Goblet of Fire had quite a bit of good stuff in the extended version they showed on TV, and not doing an extended version for it here is really a loss.  I bought the first two and I bought Prisoner (it's my favorite), but I won't be buying any more.      That said, if you're willing to pay $30 for several hours of documentaries, it's not a bad buy.  The Prisoner one featured part 3 of their ongoing, cross-movies feature, this one on the creatures of Harry Potter.  It was pretty interesting and informative, particularly how much animatronics they use versus CGI.  The robot Fawkes is amazing, as is the hippogriff.  Also, it was pretty priceless to see that they actually considered (and did some work toward)having a troll ballet in the Half Blood Prince!  The other documentaries were done at the time of the movie release, and are fine, although nothing spectacularly new.  And there is a visit to the creature shop which was fun.  Otherwise there are a couple of trailers for the movie and a lot of ads for related product coming out. If that's worth the price, then there you go.  Otherwise, save your money.
B002E2QHBS|4.0|I was surprised when I open the box CD set and I found a huge amount of photo inside the album. It's much more then a CD booklet! Someone said that several songs, from the original playset are missing, that's true. Nevertheless the amount of songs and mind of the Woodstock historical event is there, for sure!    Good choise! Good Music!  Enjoy!
0439023513|4.0|I'm not sure I read the same book as some of these reviewers. I enjoyed this book as much as the prior two. It was sad, charaters died, that happens in war. I enjoyed the ending and didn't walk away from the book feeling cheated.  Oh well, don't let the bad reviews turn you away from reading the last installment of the Hunger Games. Can't wait for the movie!
006145205X|4.0|Ridley's thesis is that the key to prosperity lies in economic growth, and that economic growth is caused primarily by innovation fueled by the exchange and mating of ideas.  As long as ideas are allowed to move freely they will inevitably mate, mutate, and produce innovations that will drive economic growth and improve the quality of life:<br /><br />\\"The perpetual innovation machine that drives the modern economy owes its existence not mainly to science (which is its beneficiary more than its benefactor); nor to money (which is not always a limiting factor); nor to patents (which often get in the way); nor to government (which is bad at innovation). It is not a top-down process at all. Instead, I am going to try now to persuade you that one word will suffice to explain this conundrum: exchange. It is the ever-increasing exchange of ideas that causes the ever-increasing rate of innovation in the modern world.\\"<br /><br />Why is Ridley a \\"rational optimist\\"?  Because, in his words, he has \\"arrived at optimism not through temperament or instinct, but by looking at the evidence\\".  As Ridley sees it, throughout history, when the free exchange of ideas has been hampered by natural disasters, disease, war, wrong-headed government policy and monopolistic business practices, the result has been a reverse in development and a regression of health and happiness.  Despite these periods of regression, Ridley remains optimistic that the world will continue to get better as long as we ensure that society remains open.  Recent developments in communication technology have only accelerated what Ridley sees as an already robust atmosphere for ideational mating.  This, combined with the progress already achieved in medicine, agriculture, and human rights gives him more hope than not that as a global society we will avoid the many catastrophic predictions making the rounds.<br /><br />Overall, the book was quite enjoyable.  Ridley spares no sacred cows and marshalls logical and empirical evidence to make his point--whether he is eviscerating the organic farming and climate change movements or patent rights.  He traces over 200,000 years of human history to make the case that we are, on balance, far better today than we have ever been.  This isn't to gloss over the many problems that persist.  Rather, Ridley freely admits the issues we face while arguing that the past should give us confidence that these issues will also be overcome.  History has shown us that when ideas are allowed to freely move about and reproduce with each other, society is able to drastically improve itself and solve seemingly intractable problems.  I would have liked to see more explicit discussion of ideational \\"mating\\", rather than it's sprinkling through various chapters, but overall the point is well taken.  My biggest peave with the book is Ridley's treatment of government.<br /><br />Ridley is clearly not a \\"big government\\" advocate, and that is a totally reasonable position.  The idea that innovation and economic growth is primarily driven by bottom-up activity versus top-down planning and decree is correct.  However, at many points in the book, Ridley seemingly fails to adequately wrestle with the fact that much of the progress he lauds is a by-product of optimal government policy, not despite it.<br /><br />For example, when discussing how the country of Botswana could have developed at an incredible rate despite facing many of the same crushing obstacles as other perpetually underdeveloped African states, Ridley succintly notes that the main difference was that Botswana had \\"good institutions\\":<br /><br />\\"In particular, Botswana turns out to have secure, enforceable property rights that are fairly widely distributed and fairly well respected. When Daron Acemoglu and his colleagues compared property rights with economic growth throughout the world, they found that the first explained an astonishing three quarters of the variation in the second and that Botswana was no outlier: the reason it had flourished was because its people owned property without fear of confiscation by chiefs or thieves to a much greater extent than in the rest of Africa. This is much the same explanation for why England had a good eighteenth century while China did not.\\"<br /><br />I agree whole heartedly with Ridley's emphasis on property rights.  Here, he is following such eminent economic historians as Douglass North (whom he cites) by emphasizing that good institutions are critical to shaping the economic outcomes we hope to achieve.  However, Ridley goes on to argue that property rights cannot simply be imposed from above by government, but must evolve from the bottom-up.  The bottom-up evolution of institutions and the importance of government are not mutually exclusive or at odds.  Optimal property rights, particularly those that allow for robust exchange in an impersonal economy, must at some point be formalized and enforced through fully functioning legal and court systems.  Additionally, they must be codified in a such a way where they can be changed if necessary to improve their efficiency and functionality.  The only way to formalize such rules, ensure their proper enforcement, and allow for occasional \\"tweaking\\" is to have in place a government system that is at once robust in it's authority and responsive enough to citizens to minimize the abuse of property rights (e.g. through the creation of a rentier class).  In other words, liberal Democracy.  This is not to say that governments are optimal or do not, in some cases, harm innovation and economic growth (surely they do).  Rather, the point is that the dynamics that Ridley so covets cannot flourish despite government, but rather require \\"good\\" governments and institutions that can facilitate free idea exchange and commerce.because its people owned property without fear of confiscation by chiefs or thieves to a much greater extent than in the rest of Africa.

0525951652|5.0|Unlike the majority of reviewers, I actually read the book.  I would say that Fall of Giants is in the same league as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  This sweeping saga is hard to put down.  You will fall in love with the characters.  Ken Follett is the best in the genre.  No comparison. He can't write books fast enough to keep me satisfied.  I will buy them all, no matter what the price(within reason).
0307276902|2.0|Here's another reason not to do drugs:  you might end up writing a best-selling memoir about your rehab, get blasted by Oprah Winfrey for lying to the public, and end up with your reputation in tatters but enough money to not care.  James Frey's \\"semi-fictional memoir\\" (whatever that means) \\"a million little pieces\\" has garnered so much public controversy over its accuracy that people have forgotten to ask:  well, is it good or not?  Which is too bad, because the book really does suck, and often I felt I was reading literary porn, grotesquely blatant details that I simply did not want to know and had great difficulty believing.  Apparently, the protagonist did enough drugs in the morning to knock out a brontosaurus.      Yet another reason not to do drugs is that you might forget important things, like proper punctuation.  The entire book lacked quotation marks, which for some readers may make the book sound and read poetic but which I thought pretentious and annoying.  There's a nice rhythm to the book, and clearly James Frey has a good musical ear, but it'd be better if he had a sharp eye.  The book is overwrought and sprawling, and the 511-page book, by my estimation, is too long by 500 pages.      For a much better book on drug addiction, read \\"Beautiful Boy.\\"
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What a great ending to the trilogy! One of my friends said she looked up this book on wikipedia and read all the spoilers before she read it and it really killed the book for her! Duh! I do not recommend that. Readers should experience the book blow by blow. I only wish there were more to come,
B002ZG98VE|4.0|Thinking this was just another Robin Hood movie as they all look alike and always<br />follow the same storyline it seems..i decided to give this one a try.<br /> Im sure glad i did.  Its been quite a long time that i have seen a well directed<br />film with  experience actors/actresses doing their stuff at best. Finally you are<br />not stuck looking at young actors/actresses doing the impossible, winning battles<br />with kung fu or matrix crap...no you have the real thing in this film.  It is a<br />very good production, with great costumes, battles, music and great performances<br />by all.<br />I do recommenend this film, its a keeper.
0307474712|1.0|I have never written a review about ANYTHING however; this pathetically bad book deserves the criticism of this review and many more. I picked up the book because the writing idea (every chapter being the same day in a different year) seemed interesting and it reminded me of the time Travelers Wife that is in fact a great read. David Nicholls' novel idea was however, an easy way for him to transition into different chapters without much thought or effort in essence turning the chapters into short bad stories with very little theme, connection or interest not to mention it was just crap writing. The main characters are pathetic and not pathetic in a great literary way because as I mention it was bad writing from start to finish. One Day can best be summarized as a waste of time and disappointing.
B004132I20|5.0|Just bumped into the 'Study in Pink' episode from the new BBC series 'Sherlock' on PBS' Mystery Theater. For the Holmes of Victorian times, Jeremy Brett is the best Sherlock Holmes to ever grace the stage or film, and, in my arguable opinion, no other actor has breathed more life into a character from literature. That said, this new BBC series, based in comtemporary London, hooked me 5 minutes in. A few months ago I watched the original victorian Sherlock Holmes complete DVD series with Jeremy Brett - the acting and the attention to detail of Victorian England are superb. I also mused that the Victorian Holmes wouldn't translate well in a modern setting, and found myself pleasantly wrong. After seeing this series' Study in Pink', the writers and actors pulled it off handsomely. With this BBC production, set in modern London, the depth of the characters stay faithfull to Conan Doyle's original creation without the dumbing-down that Hollywood so consistently stains good literature with through scripts that distill characters from literature to prepubescent cliches (particularly Hollywood's rape of the 'Van Helsing' character, and last year's movie release of 'Sherlock Holmes') - both perfect cinimatic examples of getting it completely wrong. I felt so disgusted by what Hollywood did to these characters that I swore off the directors and writers of each, who make Ed Wood look like Cecil B. Demille and Tolstoy, respectively. This BBC series, on the other hand,  is a refreshing pleasure to take in, and I'm looking forward to seeing the other episodes. I am curious about the Blu Ray having over 400 minutes of material. I may have misread, but the description mentions only three episodes on this release. In any case, if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes and Jeremy Brett and have concerns about the integrity of the characters in a modern London, fear not. The writing and acting in this new version is engaging and entertaining without insulting your intelligence, and gives merenewed hope in television (at least across the Pond).
B004132HZS|3.0|The re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes is excellent here. The problem I have is with the director's editing.  The number one rule in Hollywood is to keep your story one step ahead of the audience, keep them guessing.<br />But in A STUDY IN PINK the directer fails at the one-hour mark as he stops the story to show us the contemplative process of Sherlock.  As this montage of events flashes by us, we the audience have solved the mystery.  Our frustration only mounts as we wait for Sherlock to come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />We should never wait for Sherlock to catch up with us, he is supposed to be smarter that the viewers.<br /><br />That said, I still found the modernization of Sherlock's world a surprising success and will keep watching in hopes the editing improves.  Even the Jeremy Brett series is not without its problem episodes.  I did get the feeling that I was watching an episode of Doctor Who as he would portray Sherlock Holmes, with a little bit of Dr. House sprinkled in.<br /><br />Kudos for the success in pulling off the modernization.  It was done before with moderate success (Having Sherlock fight the Nazis in 1941), and it appears it will work again here.

B00005ABX0|2.0|It is unbelievable to me that an album this bad could receive the plaudits it does from so many. Are these just hard-core Beach Boys fans or drug-addled remnants of the 60s? Almost everyone who came of age during that time and who followed popular music knew of the intense pressure the Beach Boys put themselves under to try to keep up with and even surpass The Beatles in popularity. And had it not been for that self-imposed stress, they maybe would have freed themselves to be themselves rather than being caught up in the trap of trying to be more avant-garde than the avant-garde itself. The mostly disjointed noise presented here is the pathetic result of their attempt making these albums sort of an embarrassment to their legacy. It's not all lousy, but you have to hear a lot of junk in between the few pieces that are tolerable.  I was a kid in San Diego during the band's heyday, so their music was all around me. I did and still do like some of their songs, but never owned a Beach Boys album until more recently when I succumbed to the hooraw about Pet Sounds. That was OK, so I picked up a few earlier albums. Then, because I've always liked the song Darlin' but never hear it anywhere, I bought this twofer. Was I in for an unpleasant surprise the first time through!  I know I am swimming against the tide giving this a two-star review, but I honestly find little to like about it. The best cuts are Heroes and Villains, the well-worn Good Vibrations, the aforementioned Darlin', the alternate take of Heroes and Villains, and the two cuts that examine the guts of Good Vibrations and offer up an early take. That's it! What stinks? Well, start with the silly and rotten Vegetables. Then move on to She's Goin' Bald, Wild Honey, the laughable attempt at soul on I Was Made to Love Her, and the awful Mama Says. The best part of this package is the meaty booklet that accompanies the CD which contains pictures, album info, and some very informative background notes to the songs anda story that helps the fans make sense of why this was foisted upon them.  Obviously, many disagree with me but my recommendation is to avoid this unless you are a Beach Boys completist or a musical masochist.
0312600844|1.0|As an avid reader I was excited to pick up this new novel with such great reviews.      Ugg, it was a tedious read with barely believable characters who seem to bring out the worst in each other.   I found my self saying, \\"I'll read another 100 pages time and again and then, I only have 200 more to go, I might as well finish it\\".  I finished the book last night.  The conclusion was so disjointed to the plot line that it lacked creditability.  It was as if Frazen said \\"I want this book ot have a happy ending\\" and skipped over six years so he could create it with no linkage to the rest of the story.    I could have, and should have, put it down days ago!

It is packed full of interviews with the cast, directors, producers, and other interesting facts about the movies. It also includes several awesome collector pieces (i.e. a marauder's map, a yule ball ticket, an advanced potion making book w/stickers, etc.) This book was worth every penny! Would make a great Christmas or birthday gift for HP fans!

And that includes the men, who have not much real ambition of their own except for finding the protagonist oh so wonderful.    It was a big trope of novels in the sixties and seventies that the writer was married to a person who was death, death, death. And the writer broke away for life, life, life. Both genders wrote this stuff.     \\"Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.\\"    Reverse the genders and women would HATE this book, and the writer.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|We all have those humiliations seared into our memories. The time a joke told at our expense made the whole class laugh. Being picked last for the team or not at all. Being stood up for a date.    And we imagined revenge. Not the binding and gagging and tossing over a cliff kind of revenge (okay, I've thought of that too) but the French proverb \\"Success is the best revenge\\" type. We dream of achieving such   incredible success that those who treated us poorly will deeply regret it and the whole world will see us for the phenomenal individuals we are.    Say, you found a company with a very popular product that is valued around the world and in the process become a multibillionaire. Then surely you would have the respect of one and all. Unless you're Mark Zuckerberg, the   co-founder of Facebook about whom a major film has just been released that portrays him as a .... let's use the polite word... jerk.    \\"The Social Network\\", written by Aaron Sorkin (\\"The West Wing\\") and directed by David Fincher (\\"Se7en\\"), follows Zuckerberg from his early days at Harvard, pulling rude computer pranks, through his rise to become one of the most powerful CEOs in the world. And the film strongly implies that his motivation for technological and corporate innovation come from such slights as the girl who broke up with him and the elite university clubs that ignored him.    Zuckerberg is portrayed as a brilliant geek sorely lacking in social skills, deceptive and manipulative in his rise to fortune. He seems at times to be the embodiment of Matthew 16:26 (\\"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?\\") except at times it's unclear if he had a soul to begin with.    Much of the story is told in the form of flashbacks as the film follows legal proceedings of lawsuits filed by rivals and also his best friend, yet it should always be kept in mind that this is a fictionalized version of the events. Much of the history told in the story is not buried in those very lawsuits with very strict nondisclosure agreements.    An interesting thing about the film is that some viewers will see the film as a success story and others will see it as a tragedy. Zuckerberg (portrayed quite ably by \\"Zombieland\\"'s Jesse Eisenberg) did achieve something very special in the creation of Facebook. Though a recent some consider it a gimmicky time-waster, it is also arguably the most innovative tool for communication since the Internet itself, created by a man before he hit his mid twenties.     On the other hand, some view Zuckerberg's falling out with his best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), as cautionary tale against putting self interest first. (This theme is suggested in the film's tagline, \\"You don't make 500 million friends without making a few enemies.\\")    And you know, kids, you're both right. This film is about a flawed guy who achieves some amazing things. If this world is all there is, then it's worth cutting some ethical corners when the stakes are so high. But if there is a God watching us and wanting the best for us and an eternity waiting after this life, then something very vital has been left out of the equation.    Now you may still be saying, \\"Why should I see this film? I don't even go on Facebook!\\" Well, you don't have to be an astronaut to watch \\"The Right Stuff\\". And the reasons you should see this film include rich, funny dialogue, sharp performances and some interesting moral questions to ponder. In Facebook parlance, I think it's worth clicking \\"Confirm\\" rather than \\"Ignore\\".

Ma moves Bunny around real slow to better the picture with his ears and head.\\"    Not only is the baby talk hard on the inner ear, what are the odds of finding what is primarily a cable show on one of the lower broadcast channels at the time when networks are showing their morning news shows?

Not only is SH made into a boxer and street fighter, but he is something of a rebel rake.  This goes against my memories of him as an austere Victorian who survived and thrived by his wits more than his fists.  Also, perhaps I am getting old, but I have absolutely no recollection of what the caper was, which is a sure sign (to me) that it failed to engage me in the slightest.<br /><br />Not recommended.

The follow-up in the Caster Chronicles is thrilling, emotional, evocative, and entirely original.<br /><br />Ethan and Lena's story picks up right where it left off, but it takes an entirely different approach early on. Lena wasn't claimed during her Claiming Moon and that makes her unique in the Caster world. She's not Light or Dark, but eventually she'll have to choose one. With the loss of her beloved uncle Macon and the increasing distance between her and Ethan, it's just a matter of time before something gives.<br /><br />Ethan, who I wholeheartedly adore, goes on quite the journey in this one and he really comes out much more grown up. Everything he goes through should break him, yet it doesn't. For this (and so many other reasons), I love him. In fact, I'd say I have more than a little book boy crush on Ethan and I'd pick him over John Breed any day.<br /><br />Now, some of you may be asking, who is John Breed? Well, he's a gorgeously dark and handsome, yet mysteriously dangerous, Harley-riding, somehow paranormal guy who just happens to get under Ethan's skin. And he may or may not hang out with everyone's favorite lollipopping blonde.<br /><br />He's just one new character in the mass of so many. The paranormal aspect that was only just beginning to bloom in Beautiful Creatures, really picks up here. With Casters, Incubus, Succubus, Seers, Greats, Vexes, Sheers, and so many other creatures, Beautiful Darkness is a paranormal party. One that you certainly do not want to miss out on.<br /><br />With the introduction of so many new characters, some of my favorite people all but disappeared, but the story grows in their absence. The Caster World expands way beyond Gatlin County and becomes this entire force of its own. Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl whip out so many twists and turns that I was left with my head spinning at the unexpected occurrences. The Caster World is incredibly well thought out and developed, so much so that I could actually believe it existed, right under our feet in Tunnels and passages.<br /><br />With a cast of characters and a slew of unimaginable powers, the girl, the curse, and the grave come back to life in Beautiful Darkness. The story that began with an unsuspecting guy, a new girl, and some very strange dreams, explodes into a world that is so far beyond Gatlin's borders. If you had your doubts about this series, you can push them aside now. Garcia and Stohl have more than proved that the Caster Chronicles is worth devoting your heart and soul to. Their characters grab hold of your head and your heart and never seem to let go.<br /><br />Opening line: I used to think our town, buried in the South Carolina backwoods, stuck in the muddy bottom of the Santee River valley, was the middle of nowhere. ~ pg. 1<br /><br />Favorite lines: There's something about sitting alone in the dark that reminds you how big the world really is, and how far apart we all are. The stars look like they're so close, you could reach out and touch them. But you can't. Sometimes things look a lot closer than they are. ~ pg. 68Caster World is incredibly well thought out and developed, so much so that I could actually believe it existed, right under our feet in Tunnels and passages.

B003YNFYCO|3.0|If you have the box set make your own set and reward yourself with a few bonus tracks. If you don't have the box set then you will be pleased with this because every song is a masterpiece.     These songs were lifted from the 2009 remasters. If they remixed them I would have given it five stars. It is a five star collection for the casual fan or the die hard fan who doesn't have the box set.
142313494X|5.0|I bought the first four books of this series, not knowing anything about the books or author. I then read all the comments readers have offered. I hoped that the book would be at a reader level to fit my struggling grandson. THEN I read the books myself. Who knows if he will be able to \\"read\\" the books, but my hope was that he will find great reasons to try. I suggest getting all 4-5 books, reading to child to get him \\"hooked,\\" and then let Riordan do the rest. Great gift idea; don't wait for a special occasion.
B003YNFYD8|3.0|Do you have the stereo box set? Then save your money, otherwise it's a must have. The remasters from last year have no remixing. They have a clear crisp sound and these songs were lifted from those. Many fans didn't want remixing for the remasters and those fans got their wish.  This would have been the perfect opportunity to bring their sound into the 21st. century. I guess EMI and The Beatles themselves figure they can milk us suckers a little while longer before giving it a proper mix so they can milk us again. Also, it wouldn't have harmed them to add additional tracks that cd's allow. After all, the work to put this collection together was already done for the remasters over a year ago.      Had they done the right thing and remixed music released after they broke up I would have given this five stars because every song is outstanding except for about a dozen songs that are beyond outstanding.
1423113381|4.0|I thought the book was good - if not compared to the Percy Jackson books. The story was engaging and fun. I am a huge fan of Greek Mythology and I hate to admit it but very ignorant of Egyptian mythology. This book was a fun way to learn about another cultures mythology and kept me engaged in the story. Would have been five stars if Percy Jackson wasn't written, just hard not to compare the two series.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this title - although it was more serious in tone (I laughed out loud a few times reading the Percy Jackson series, this one was sadder and darker in tone).

B002ZG98LO|4.0|PREDATORS takes us back to what made the first film so damn good. One good move is in ensuring that there weren't sexy sullen teens mucking about, and this works to right away remove that teen slasher stench that piggybacked the franchise with the second AVP film. A suspenseful atmosphere is evoked from jump, as the opening scene features a man waking up in freefall. The parachute activates, and the stranger lands on a foreboding steamy jungle, and he's soon joined by other deadly-looking humans, all heavily armed. A sweeping glance informs that this isn't a band of saints and samaritans. Our eyes take in the San Quentin inmate, the death-squad goon from Sierra Leone, the IDF sniper, the heartless mercenary, the Latin Mafia thug, the Spetsnaz operative, the Yakuza gangster, and, er, a physician. Later on, Laurence Fishburne surfaces, and his crackpot character is also pretty unsavory.<br /><br />This group of nasties soon learn that they're been abducted to a hostile alien planet (the non-moving sun is a strong giveaway). It dawns on them that this alien planet is, in fact, a hunting preserve. And that they are the prey. So it doesn't take long before that bump of self-preservation kicks in and our characters are jockeying for position.<br /><br />The suspense is terrific. These cold-blooded killers on the run leave you perplexed as to who to cheer for, excepting Alice Braga's Isabelle. She seems to be the only straight shooter in this shady bunch. On the other hand, Topher Grace's doctor character seems so out of place I wasn't sure what to think of him. To segue now, PREDATORS resolves the different looks that these chittering, crab-faced alien hunters have espoused down the years. It turns out there are different classes of Predators, and that some look down on others. This becomes a crucial plot point.<br /><br />Folks may bemoan the absence of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jesse Ventura or Carl Weathers. Topher Grace is certainly no Schwarzenegger, and neither is Adrien Brody. Heck, the notion of Adrien Brody as an action hero boggles the brain. But then you sit thru this film, and it's a bit of an eye-opener. Brody as the prohibitive lead character seems a casting choice that's just off the beaten path. And yet Brody manages to go from tickling the ivories in THE PIANIST to bulking up and being badasss and adopting a growly Batman-type voice. He pulls it off. Alice Braga, the Brazilian bombshell, isn't quite the action heroine that Ripley or Sarah Connor were, but she injects depth to her character, and she is, I reiterate, a Brazilian bombshell. And, from out of left field, Louis Ozawa Changchien becomes an unlikely gent to root for. Changchien doesn't get a lot of lines but, as the Yakuza killer Hanzo, he exudes great presence. From the moment he's introduced, in his dapper suit, he was an instant favorite, and the film treats him with courtesy.<br /><br />I love the hell out of the 1987 Schwarzenegger film, and I promptly recognized the musical score that heralded Hanzo's showdown with the Predator. It's the same score - but now with Oriental flourishes - that played back in '87 while Billy (remember him?) calmly stood there at the bridge, awaiting his death. Throughout its narrative, this sequel made subtle use of the original score from the original PREDATOR.<br /><br />Danny Trejo is here also and in IMDb his character is listed as \\"Cuchillo,\\" and this makes me smile.<br /><br />PREDATORS vastly improves on your generic sci-fi thriller. It is intense and moody, and action-packed and well-acted. For the most part, the pace moves briskly, and the fun as always lies in trying to pick out which of the cast are the victims and survivors. This is a welcome follow-up; it doesn't at all embarrass the franchise. Maybe one nitpick is that the kills aren't so innovative or jaw-dropping, although I did enjoy that moment of no-nonsense spine removal. I get the definite sense that we as a movie-going audience have become pretty desensitized. I know I lost MY innocence when I saw that cartoon of Godzilla stepping on Bambi.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus material includes audio commentary by producer Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal. \\"Decloaking the Invisible: Alien Terrain\\" is the Behind the Scenes featurette (00:10:41 minutes long).

B001718N96|5.0|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001718N96/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img<br /><br />There are several editions of this book on Kindle. This is not the best edition; however, the book itself is rightly considered a classic, as the retired Belgian police detective appears for the first time. The book was written because Agatha Christie read a detective novel she considered inferior, and said, \\"I can write a better one myself.\\" A relative challenged her to do so, and she did. The rest is literary history.<br /><br />The most important plot elements involve a hospital dispensing area, in which Christie worked as a volunteer during World War I. The inside glimpse would be unforgettable, even if it weren't part of an unforgettable novel. Fittingly, for the final Poirot novel both Poirot and Hastings return to Styles, which is now a guest house. Christie wrote both the last Poirot novel and the last Miss Marple novel long before her death, and stashed them in a safe deposit box to appear posthumously. She then proceeded to write many more novels in both series, so when the final novels appear they seem somewhat dated in terms of their publishing dates. But it was thoughtful of her to do it that way, as she provided closure to both series.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I love this album more than nightwish's previous work with tarja. If you hate this so much then why did you buy it, it's called listning to the sample before you buy. Another thing Tarja isn't gone, she left night wish but she has left the business so if you love her so much than buy her music instead of complaining about nighwish's new direction. Tarja has a very strong opera voice but now on this album the band was able to add a new layer. There's a huge orchestra, I highly recomend buying the verson with the second disk which is all orcestral versions of the songs.
B003YNFYCO|4.0|Considering the sumptuous treatment the back catalog has been enjoying these days, you'd think that record executives would have taken taken advantage of the resurgence in interest to release a Mono version of the Red Album.<br /><br />After all, most of these tracks were first heard in mono, anyway.

1400064287|4.0|Chip and Dan Heath's `Made to Stick' gives a very \\"SUCCESs\\"ful display of how simple ideas can become worldwide phenomenon with a little push in the right direction.  Common denominator of most successful ideas is that they are \\"sticky.\\"  These ideas have certain criteria to them that make them gain this stickiness, they are: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, and can be backed up with Stories (SUCCESs).      The Heath's brothers give the example of Southwest for Simple, Southwest's motto was being THE low fare airline, every business decision they make must go back to this initial idea, otherwise it is scrapped immediately. Unexpected can be anything that defies your preconceived notion of a situation, like a normal car commercial that all of the sudden turns fatal when another car broadsides the other.  Concrete can deal with anything that shows the validity of the idea, like how a teacher after Martin Luther King Jr. died decided to divide her children by brown and blue eyed to show how discrimination actually works.  Credible is anything that comes from someone in the know, like how Pam Laffin died at the age of thirty-one because she smoked since she was ten.  Emotional is anything that arouses your emotion to the situation, like how TV ads will show you a specific child in Africa that eats once every other day and needs your help (since if they gave a broad spectrum of hunger in Africa, there is no emotional connection to it).  Stories can leave a lasting impact on you, like the story of Jared from Subway who was able to overcome all odds and lose over 250 pounds by eating Subway.    Chip and Dan Heath do very well in explaining exactly how ideas become sticky, and what are some of the pitfalls to avoid when trying to get your message across, like the Curse of Knowledge (just because you know or understand something, does not mean everyone else does or should).  They explain that stickiness is not about repetition, it's about being able to saywhat you need to say once and have everyone listen.

B0040YFR1Y|3.0|This is best predator movie since the the original. I love the premise for this one. But the movie does not add anything to the mysique that the other movies did. This is basically an action film that stands on it's own. Nothing original happens. Basciacally a retread of all the spills and thrills of the original. That's not to say it's a bad film. I enjoyed it. It was cool to see ex-UFC champ in the movie and there were some unexpected twists. If you like action give this a try and is fun. But Don't expect anything original.

0891419063|5.0|I have just started reading books about WWII battles in the Pacific.  I read \\"The Pacific\\" first, three times back to back.  After getting to know the characters, Sledgehammer, Sidney Phillips and R.V. Burgin, I purchased their books.  I finished \\"You'll be Sor-ree!\\" over two evenings and I am now reading \\"With the Old Breed\\".  I can certainly say that I feel like I have a better idea as to the hellish experience our troops faced during WWII.  Sidney Phillips, as well as Eugene Sledge, recount thier experiences in different ways, Sledge with a reserved and refined style of writing and Phillips with more boyish humor.  As I read thier stories I find I have developed a great respect for all of those who served and I wish I could have had the chance to meet them and express my thanks.<br /><br />I am surprised how much of \\"The Pacific\\" was taken directly from each of these books.  I have been disappointed a few times because I was reading the exact same story word for word.  However, I am still enjoying the reading and turn each page with anticipation.

I have 140 Blu-ray discs in my collection, and all play fine, repeatedly. Old ones, new ones, cheap ones, expensive ones.    I'll do more research, but for now, it seems likely there is a manufacturing problem with this Blu-ray disc.

0312965788|5.0|Heartwarming and excellent in every regard. James Herriot's storytelling is incredible, and his stories are no less vibrant. Almost every person he meets has their own vibrant characteristics. From joyful and good-ending boy/dog stories and disappointing hardship tales from the dales around his practice this is a book I would recommend to young and old, cantankerous and ebullient.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|As I remember the North Side of the Eiger (Eiger Nordwand) is also called Eiger Mordwand (Murder Wall) due to its extreme mountain climbing difficulty compounded by ongoing rock falls, avalanches and storms. This movie is about an attempt to scale the wall for the first time by two (accidental) teams of two, a German and an Austrian. The German team gets to the mountain by riding their bicycles from Berchtesgaden! What starts out as a peaceful little climb in front of the watchful eyes of journalists and tourists turns into a tragic event that truly touches anyone who is watching this movie. There were times when the slowly moving camera (from a true bird's eye view) showing the dark grey rocks of the Eiger reminded me of the waves of the dark ocean surrounding the sinking Titanic. Not trying to spoil the ending I would only say that this is a perfectly made movie free from cliches or predictability; the cinematography is excellent, the acting is perfect and the experience is heart breaking.
0451191153|4.0|The individualist has always had an ambivalent relationship with the market. On the one hand, the market is an inevitable consequence of the individual right to own and trade property. On the other hand, the market is the physical embodiment of the opinions of other persons about how artifacts and activities are to be valued, and the individualist insists upon deciding these values for himself.<br /><br />Ayn Rand's education in Soviet Russia made her intimately familiar with Marx's writings, including his theory of alienation. Her response to this theory is represented by the character Howard Roark in _The Fountainhead_, who insists upon maintaining a non-alienated relationship to his work as an architect. Roark is unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity and independence, even when his tenacity leads to dire hardship.<br /><br />The joy of owning material things is small in comparison to the joy of genuinely self-directed creative work, of forming and developing one's own vision and bringing it to realization. To sacrifice the joy of self-directed work for the joy of ownership is a very imprudent--and yet also very common--decision. This sort of imprudence is represented in _The Fountainhead_ by Peter Keating. Keating recognizes the market as the highest arbiter of value. He does whatever it takes to bring in client revenue. The consequence is that he becomes extravagantly wealthy--and miserably unhappy.<br /><br />In a world populated only by Peter Keatings, free market capitalism might be the most just way to organize society, but it would be an aesthetically repulsive and psychologically disastrous way to organize society. It is the possibility of an uncompromisingly self-directed man like Howard Roark that vindicates capitalism in the aesthetic and psychological realm as well as in the realm of justice.<br /><br />Ayn Rand is able to make an unequivocal recommendation for a universal free market because she believes she has solved the problem of alienation. It would seem, however, that although her recommendations for government policies of laissez-faire capitalism have had a not entirely insignificant political influence, the ethic of non-alienated work upon which this recommendation is predicated has had comparatively little influence. The leaders of contemporary commercial enterprises are unabashed in their insistence upon recognizing the market as the ultimate arbiter and director of all their decisions and activities. What should be recognized as a vice--spineless submission to public opinion as embodied in the marketplace--comes to be thought of as a virtue. To call an enterprise \\"market driven\\" is universally recognized as unequivocal praise.<br /><br />The principle which Roark puts into practice is summarized in his maxim, \\"I don't build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build.\\" In other words, Roark's practice is not \\"market-driven.\\" It is driven by his own need to realize his artistic vision.<br /><br />Is it possible for an individual employee in a contemporary commercial enterprise to adopt a self-realization-centered approach to his work, when the primary goal of his employer is to fulfill market needs which will certainly not always coincide with the employee's needs for self-realization? The inevitable conflicts might in the end make the employee who insists upon self-realization unemployable, consigning him to work in the rock quarry. But a tenacious perseverance and insistence upon doing work in a fulfilling way might eventually pay off--as it does for Roark in _The Fountainhead_.on.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|An excellent film for what it is.  Perhaps that's the most important qualifier - this is an animated film designed for adults, mostly Gen X like myself who grew up on the 1990s animated series.  In spite of our matured tastes, we still appreciate their bringing a good solid romp such as this to us in the present day.    In the tradition of \\"Superman: Doomsday\\" and others, the tone is darker, the themes more adult, the violence more gritty and sometimes disturbing.  The animation is more refined, and certain much-beloved voices while in absentia, are done proud by their replacements.  If you don't think so, compare this \\"update\\" of the Joker with the one from \\"The Batman\\" series which many never warmed to.      While I agree that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are an irreplaceable Batman and Joker and that change for change's sake is anathema to any true fan, I will say that these voices seemed a good fit for the animation and storyline.  It just felt more... evolved.  Grown.  I would have been a bit disturbed to see a story like this voiced by such beloved heavy-hitters as Conroy and Hamill.  This is not their time or place, and the movie reflects that.    I will leave the minutia of the tale to others, except to mention that this was a remarkably true-to-form retelling of the comic storyline featuring Jason Todd's resurrection.  Very little was changed, and many of the story points were succinctly included without detracting from the rest.  What adjustments were made served to tighten the storyline and remove potential confusion, and this was well-executed.    One last note: the comic book ending to this story was never given, due to the \\"One Year Later\\" storyline disrupting all DC events, and I found the one provided here to be true to form and dissatisfying in just the right way that the story needed.    So yes, as I said at the start, an excellent film for what it is.  Just know what you're getting into and if it's your thing, then by all means enjoy the ride.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|I tend to read reviews before I purchase books, especially for my Kindle. I have to say, I wasn't led astray. This is a wonderfully written novel. As an adult who often picks up the better rated YA novels, this was SUCH a breath of fresh air. My only complaint being that I wanted MORE of the characters. The depth was there but I felt they had more to say. How happy was I to see 'Linger' was waiting in the wings - it didn't have to wait long...but I'll be waiting for July 2011 for Grace, Sam, Isabel and Cole's story to continue yet again.

Its a little different style than the Percy books, but the author maintains his ability to speak realistically and maintain the feeling of real teens even if they are demigods.    First off you have some new characters mixed in with old familiar characters. The story alternates between Jason, Piper, and Leo, our three main characters's point of view.  It takes place very soon after \\"The Last Olympian\\" ends, Percy fans will be hooked from the beginning:    Jason wakes up and finds himself holding hands with a girl, surrounded by people he doesn't know, whats worse he doesn't know who he is.     Piper is pretty but doesn't want to be noticed, her dad doesn't know what to do with her and she has been having weird dreams, her dad might be in trouble and Jason can't remember her.    Leo the funny man always making jokes and building stuff, things always seem to go wrong for Leo, and now his best friend can't remember him.    The trio meet a goat, get hit by storms, hitch a ride from a chariot and find themselves at Camp Half Blood. All they know is strange things have happened, the gods aren't responding, something much worse is coming, and the three have been hand picked to help full fill the great prophecy, but first a quest to retrieve Jason's memory.      The book is about 550 pages of easy reading.  The way the author alternated the point of view keeps you hungry for more and makes ya not want to stop reading.  Also included in the back of this book is a brief description of the gods mentioned in the book for reference which I thought was a nice edition.      I'm an adult, I had greek myths read to me as bed time stories when i was little, I think that Riordan does a great job of freshening up the tales and mixing it up still teaching about mythology but in a way that will make people go out of their way to get more information about not only mythology but the ancient world in general.  Goodjob, great book, buy it, read it, re-read it!
B0040JHNZ2|1.0|I was so looking forward to a new Ken follet after so enjoying lots of his novels in the past. What a disappointment fall of giants has been. I found myself fast forwarding too many times, and yawning frequently. A real let down!
0307346617|3.0|Too much breadth, too little depth.  I don't believe any story in the book exceeds 5 pages.  At least 10% of the pages must be devoted to the endless stream of new characters that must be introduced for each short episode.  Only a handful of characters (maybe 5?) have a followup story at the end of the book.<br /><br />  If he had created 2-4 primary characters, and followed their trip thru the war, it would probably have been a much more riveting novel.  Instead, it's an endless stream of \\"soundbite\\" stories.  All sizzle, no steak.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|\\"Let the Right One In\\" is a great film, in my view one of the best films of the modern era and far and away the best horror movie I have seen.  This Blu-Ray edition has the theatrical English subtitles, thanks to Magnet Releasing's wise decision to discontinue producing the poorly-done prior version in the middle of 2009.  If you are considering buying this Blu-Ray, please DISREGARD the customer reviews that have given it 1-star due to the subtitle problem, as those complaints are now moot.  As Amazon has stated near the top of the product listing (but unfortunately contradicted by the hundreds of negative reviews that are still posted about the no-longer-a-problem-subtitle-issue), the Blu-Ray is what you would have seen if you were one of the lucky few who got to see Tomas Alfredson's masterpiece in theaters.    Alfredson, not traditionally a horror director, brings the perfect touch to this coming-of-age story.  Oskar and Eli are both identifiable and sympathetic, much more so than one would think if you merely read the story on paper.  Even the less sympathetic characters are fleshed out (literally and figuratively) as the story progresses so that when violence does erupt, it has that much more impact.  This is not your uncle's slasher film with cardboard characters that are offered up merely for the killing.     Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrant, as Eli and Oskar, are spot on in their portrayals, giving nuanced performances well ahead of their years.  If as a child you were ever bullied, or felt like an outsider, or regarded the adults around you as only \\"half there\\" and not fully engaged in your life even when you tried to call out to them, even if these were only things you saw others going through as a 12-year-old or young teenager, you can relate to these characters.      Visually and in its sound landscape, the film is nothing short of terrific.  The cold, wintry Swedish town, and the troubled (sometimes pathetic) apartments and people who live in them, serve as a perfect backdrop.  Afredson keeps his camera at a distance from much of the bloody action, choosing a more subtle approach except for the few scenes when more explicit violence was appropriate.  The result is a haunting, beautiful film that belongs in any Blu-Ray collector's library.  5+ stars!
B003ZHVJFK|3.0|If nothing else, \\"Tekken\\" gets in my good graces just for being what it is: a flashy and ultimately decent tournament-based martial arts movie bearing an impressive cast list. The film's eventual falling point, however, is that it's based on a video game series that's so much better than decent that I can't help but lament that it isn't as awesome as what I've been able to create on arcade screens for the past sixteen years. If judged solely on these latter disadvantages, my rating for this film would be lower, but in light of my genuine appreciation for the remaining content, I'm going to consider it from a rounder perspective and name it as one of the better adaptations out there.<br /><br />Like in most video game flicks, the story suffers. It's played straight and high-tech, excluding all supernatural elements from the games and seriously watering down the triangle of contempt that serves as the canon plotline between the three main characters, Jin Kazama (Jon Foo, [[ASIN:B000I0RNWU The Protector]]), Kazuya Mishima (Ian Anthony Dale, [[ASIN:B005H7NO5E Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]), and Heihachi Mishima (Cary Tagawa, [[ASIN:0790729997 Mortal Kombat]]). The film takes place in a dystopian future where the Mishima-run Tekken corporation reigns supreme over a scarred earth and sponsors a regular fighting tournament to keep the masses entertained. After the death of his mother at the hands of the organization, Jin enters the tournament to avenge her while Kazuya plots the overthrow of his father.<br /><br />The backgrounds of most of the characters have been addled a bit as well, which is disappointing but I'll argue that their better-than-average casting makes up for some of this: Luke Goss ([[ASIN:B00005JKWJ Blade II]]) as Steve Fox, Gary Daniels ([[ASIN:B002ZG999U The Expendables]]) as Bryan Fury, Darrin Henson ([[ASIN:B001675ZKG Soul Food]]) as Raven, Lateef Crowder ([[ASIN:B003FXXNH6 Undisputed III: Redemption]]) as Eddy Gordo, Cung Le ([[ASIN:B002QW7ALM Pandorum]]) as Marshall Law, and several others are swell fits, making for one of the best ensembles ever seen in a fighting-themed adaptation like this (or at least a much better one than in [[ASIN:B004WSA4AW The King of Fighters]]). Utilization of these performers and characters, however, is another issue: Heihachi and Steve Fox are prominent characters but don't fight at all, Kazuya is written as a slimy rich boy rather than the fighting beast we know him as, and - with very few exceptions - no character besides Jin has more than a single fight.<br /><br />When they do fight, however, it's mostly good stuff. Director Dwight Little hasn't done much action fare since he directed Steven Seagal and Brandon Lee during their prime, but he seems to have gotten better with age: he and choreographer Cyril Raffaelli wrangle some very competent brawls which occasionally peak as deliciously eye-opening, like during the Eddie Gordo and Bryan Fury fights. In-game fighting styles are mimicked pretty well (sans Marshall Law, whose portrayer sticks with his MMA instead of jeet kune do) and even the actors who aren't real-life martial artists come across looking tough. On the downside, almost all of the fights could've been longer, if only to do justice to the millions of times the same match-ups have taken place between gamers, and slow-motion was unquestionably overutilized. The final match between Jin and Kazuya was ruined by the movie's portrayal of the latter, but the remaining seven should all be considered generally satisfying if you're not out to hate them.<br /><br />In the end, this one doesn't transcend the game-to-movie curse that we're all waiting to see shed and hardcore fans will rightfully bash the snot out of the altered storyline and missing characters, but as far as this button-masher goes, my needs have been sated...maybe not by the ideal \\"Tekken\\" movie, but by a good fight flick that ought to have gotten better than a direct-to-video release.as Marshall Law, and several others are swell fits, making for one of the best ensembles ever seen in a fighting-themed adaptation like this (or at least a much better one than in [[ASIN:B004WSA4AW The King of Fighters]]).

B002MXA7TC|5.0|I bought this album because I loved Sweet Disposition so much, and I've found the rest of the album to be just as enjoyable. The Temper Trap reminds me of what the lovechild of a threeway between U2, Coldplay, and Jeff Buckley would be like. Love Lost and Fader are two of my favorites, but to be honest, there isn't a single track on this album that I skip through. They're all thoughtful, well-written, and beautifully produced. Buy it - you won't be disappointed.

Seriously, best book you will ever read.

B002ZG995E|4.0|I have not seen the originals, but the new movie is excellent.  I had a basic knowledge of the characters and the plot of the older movies, and I thought it was excellent.  The over-the-top action scenes really hit hard, Sharlton Copley really shines as Captain Murdock, and Leeam Neeson delivers as Hannibal Smith.  A great action film if you're looking for not-too-serious over-the-top nonstop action and humor.
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|I remember writing a review here for Joe's last record, the Professor Satchafunkalis one....I titled it 'What Joe needs to do to make a great record'....I'm happy to report he followed my advice to the letter! ;)....j/k...Actually, I wrote that I wished Joe added some other musicians and let the songs and performances of others go places they haven't before. The 1st immediate noticeable thing that struck me was Mike Keneallys great keys ...all the tunes benefit from the added texture and dimension of his playing. The rhythm section is solid as well. Joe's compositions have a nice variety and sophistication that have been missing in recent years. This is good and listenable stuff track to track...while the formula is still a bit the same, the songs themselves are better. While there isn't the  earth scorching guitar virtuosity of Surfing or Crystal Planet, his playing lends itself to the songs very nicely....Maybe he's saving the mind blowing return-to-over the top-virtuoso shredding of his early days for the next CD! ;)...Not to say this one doesn't have some very cools guitar licks, it does, and the songs are varied, complex and interesting for the most part...This one will grow on you I suspect. Well done Joe!

0792164903|5.0|There are only a handful of movies that I consider to be the true Halloween classsics... and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is one of them. Loosely adapted from Washington Irving's story, this Tim Burton classic is part romance, part detective story, and part gothic horror -- and Johnny Depp helps elevate it to a brilliant supernatural thriller.<br /><br />Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders. He soon learns that the locals believe that a monstrous undead Hessian known as the Headless Horseman is the one who's beheading people. As a rational man of science, Ichabod thinks this is ridiculous... until he has a close encounter with the Horseman after he committed some of his murders.<br /><br />But Ichabod is still convinced that someone living is controlling the Horseman, and it's all wrapped up in a complex scheme involving a pregnancy, a marriage, a will, and a tangled family tree. But as deaths stack up and heads roll, Ichabod and his orphaned servant Masbeth (Marc Pickering) discover that they are up against evil that they couldn't have even imagined.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is vintage Tim Burton, back when he was a little more restrained about said style -- everything is painted in blacks, whites and greys with brief splashes of color (BLOOD!), eerie gothic buildings, and skeletal trees. And there's that little edge of rickety weirdness, especially when Depp whips out his buggy-eyed binoculars.<br /><br />Now, it's not perfect -- the witch's hentai-tongue/eyeballs always make me burst out laughing. But Burton really infuses this movie with a sense of creeping, bloody horror that gets more and more nightmarish, peppered with moments of bleak humor (Ichabod trying to throttle the Horseman) and some really disturbing beheadings.  It's a pretty sharp contrast to the rather sweet, shy romance between Ichabod and his host's daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.<br /><br />As for Depp, he's absolutely perfect -- he plays Ichabod Crane as a young man with a horrifying past (which is revealed via dreams) and an abiding love for logic, science and reason.  He's also pretty nervy, fragile and neurotic; how often do you see movie heroes who faint more often than the heroines?<br /><br />Christina Ricci is rather wooden at first, but she improves a lot as we discover some of the secrets she keeps hidden. Pickering is excellent as a young orphan who latches onto Ichabod as a surrogate father, and Miranda Richardson is all spidery creepiness as Lady Van Tassel. Also keep an eye out for Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken's hilariously over-the-top Horseman.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is all creepy atmosphere and weirdness, but it also has a solid story at its center.

B00466H3DG|5.0|Charlie Kaufman is known for creating films that bend the mind -- \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Adaptation,\\" \\"Human Nature.\\" But he takes a slightly different turn in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" a sort of romantic dark comedy that raises questions about memory and identity. It may not be the best of Kaufman's work, but it's in some ways the most endearing.<br /><br />Uptight Joel (Jim Carrey) is shocked to learn that his likably flaky ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has taken unusual measures, post-breakup. She's having her memories of him erased from her brain at Lacuna Inc. When he learns WHY she broke up with him (she thought he was boring), he gets mad and decides to have the same thing done to himself.<br /><br />So a group of offbeat techies and doctors (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst) begin to erase the memories of Clementine from Joel's brain (Wood's character also tries to use Joel's memories to seduce Clementine). Problem is, his brain doesn't want to let them go. It pokes Clementine into parts of his memory where she doesn't belong, so he won't have to let go. And viewing the memories makes him fall in love all over again...<br /><br />\\"Dark romantic comedy\\" is the closest thing that \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" has to a description. Like Kaufman's other films, it's funny in a subtle way, and more obviously sweet and romantic. Not to mention thought-provoking. If you could erase unpleasant memories, would you do it, if it changed the person you were? If we get rid of the pain, do we also get rid of the joy?<br /><br />Michel Gondry is best known for his work on Bjork, Radiohead and White Stripes music videos -- deliciously strange ones. Somehow, he fits perfectly into directing \\"Eternal Sunshine.\\" A trip through a person's brain is a hard thing to manage, but he does it -- surreal little images like a teeny tiny Winslet and Carrey bathing in a kitchen sink, or lying on the ice. It's weird, and it works. At the same time, he can capture more mundane moments well.<br /><br />Jim Carrey gives what may be his best \\"serious\\" role ever, as the conflicted, lovelorn Joel. Kate Winslet's Clementine breaks the mold of \\"romantic comedy heroine\\" with her free-spirited wackiness. Together, they make a flawed couple that you really want to see together. And Elijah Wood takes what could have been an empty role and turns Patrick into a rather pitiful, lonely figure, rather than a 2-D creep.<br /><br />As for this blu-ray edition, it's got the basic content -- feature commentary with Gondry and Kaufman, an infomercial for Lacuna, interviews with the actors and director, music videos for the Polyphonic Spree, scene analyses, a featurette about Gondry. And for the blu-ray, it has \\"My Scenes\\" that lets you bookmark scenes, and \\"Pocket Blu\\" which communicates with some devices.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is not the best from Charlie Kaufman's fertile brain, but this melancholy dark comedy is well worth checking out.

B000002LOE|4.0|Personally speaking \\"Reckoning\\" is their finest hour but not many people agree with that, which is fine. This is the one which broke them big commercially and deservedly so as it is a fine piece of work and perhaps their most accessible to date. Do not take this to mean that this album is a sell out, it is far from that. What REM did was change people's perception of commercial or mainstream, in other words they bought the mainstream to them, not the other way around. Punters were ready for something different but not totally left field and this album was it. It probably disappoints the fan that was with them from the beginning that now everyone else was listening to \\"their\\" band and it wasn't so exclusive anymore, but that's life. Losing My Religion is the BIG song on this album but it contains a mandolin for god-sake and you can't tell me that Shiny Happy People is not done with tongue in cheek.If you don't own an REM record, you should start here.
B00472O33M|4.0|I bought the 'enhanced' version of 'Reversal' because I was interested in what sound and vision might contribute to the eBook experience. Unfortunately my device doesn't support the experience (looks like you need iPad or iPhone, bugger), but I was able to see what Connelly planned to provide and I think the added experience will be terrific. 'Reversal' offers links to definitions of legal terms, videos of surveillances, and a final video of Connelly commenting on the ending (which I managed to find on another website: [...]<br /><br />I think the challenges Connelly wanted to explore in this book were technological - he wanted to play round with what eBook technology could offer. That meant including a court room so he could give the reader the links to the legal terms, plus a stream of police action so he could provide the reader/audience surveillance tapes. I haven't seen the videos, but I bet they portray Los Angeles and give the reader/audience an added experience of the city. The video he provides at the end indicates why he wanted the ending to be the way it was. It made sense and added a lot to my feelings and thoughts after I finished the book.<br />I enjoyed the enhancements and look forward to more. I might even invest in an iPad.<br /><br />On the downside, I think Connelly was less interested in the polish of his prose, character development and suspense in this book, hence some of the criticism in the reviews.<br />But I'm betting now he's got the 'enhanced version' challenge sussed, he'll get back into more Haller/Bosch stories. I think there might be conflict between the brothers on the woman front and the teenaged daughters are developing nicely as pressure points for their dads.
0783225849|5.0|The original \\"Psycho\\" never gets old in my opinion.  I've watched this movie dozens of times, and it still sends chills up my spine.  To those reviewers who are critical, because they are basing their opinion on comparisons with more recent horror flicks, I say you have to remember this was made in 1960.  It was top notch at that time (and is still tremendously popular 50 years later), Hitchcock as a director is still without peer in this genre, and the B&W scenes make it more foreboding, depressing, and scary.  It wouldn't be the same in color.  Its relative simplicity makes it more endearing, and the psychoanalysis of the killer at the end of the movie is an intelligent and thoughtful addition to it.  Perhaps those who are overly critical should mature a bit and look at it again later through different eyes. Btw, Anthony Perkins, who played Norman, was so good and well matched for the role that for years he was typecast, not always to his liking.  That's another mark of a great film.

B002ZG997C|3.0|If you're willing to suspend disbelief and imagine that this could be a true story about the future, this can be an entertaining movie with good acting and a mix of elements which you probably haven't encountered before.  But if overtly religious themes bother you, this movie may bother you as well, particularly as you approach the end, when the action lessens and the religious message takes over.<br /><br />I'm capable of falling in either of these camps, but I emphasized the former for this movie, so I liked the movie overall, though I didn't love it.  This certainly isn't a truly profound movie, and I don't think it will be one of those movies that I remember for a long time.  I could try to say more about the movie, but it just doesn't motivate me to make the effort ...
B003VIW8DK|2.0|First of all, I was excited about the prospect of a new Bryan Ferry recording.  I'm a BIG Roxy Music fan and have enjoyed some of Bryan Ferry's solo work over the decades.<br /><br />That having been said, I'm left puzzled about why this was recorded and released.  Considering all of the people with whom Mr. Ferry collaborated, I expected something new and different here.  But the simple fact is that nothing on this recording breaks new ground.  The guitars, keyboards, vocals, even hooks, all sound like warmed up leftovers from previous solo efforts.  I kept skipping to the next song, hoping to find something new, but was left wanting.<br /><br />If he was going to revisit old material / sounds, I'd have preferred that Mr. Ferry put out something like \\"As Time Goes By\\" again...which was at least a new take on his voice / sound.  How about Bryan Ferry does Cole Porter?<br /><br />Hopefully you enjoy the \\"new\\" material more than I did.

You're not even that a good writer.<br /><br />I've been to all those places myself and don't claim to have any magical insights about myself. This is why I read Kundera, Rushdie even PJ O Rourke. Honestly, a good seasoned writer could have faked this book. The sad thing for Gilbert is she really believes her own hype. What an old brat she is....<br /><br />The ones who would fall for this placid philisophy of self-idolizing are people who have never traveled much or those who idealize being society narcissist as Gilbert.<br /><br />This book is a joke on journalism and travel writing.This is narcisisstic adventure of someone on an expense account<br /><br />Let's see Gilbert follow a pack of refugees from the Burmese border going into Thailand- live among them, try to speak their language, sleep among mosquitoes, eat their food and share their aspirations. But see she cant do that because its too hard.She would have to develop real empathy and no writer's advance can buy you that.

For any graduate student doing his or her course in synthesis and there's a book that you HAVE to buy discussing the synthetic utility, mechanisms of quite famous named reactions, this book should be the one you turn to.    But on the other hand, for people those who are interested in pursuing a career in the field of synthesis and want to equip themselves in what best they can get, I strongly suggest you to buy the NAME REACTION SERIES by Jie Jack Lie. In fact, there are two more books that he is left to publish, in 2011 and 2013. Apart from those, he has the perfect collection of the \\"yummiest\\" books that any aspiring synthetic chemist needs.     Briefly: Awesome for a graduate course on synthesis and to dig a little deeper, but get a better collection of books for those who want to confine themselves to this field. :) :)
141690977X|4.0|Seriously, this is best read after you break up with a guy who was totally wrong for you.  And some of these things are so DUH, its like why didn't I see this coming a few years ago?  That is, if you're like me and waiting on one of these reasons, wondering why the guy won't do this or that, this is the book for you!  I did read this after a breakup.  Some of these letters are hysterical, but they get the point across.  The obvious things like, He's Not Calling You, He's Sleeping with Someone Else, He's Already Married to Someone Else, Not Sleeping With You, those are in here and its pretty funny at times.  But its not like some ladies out there (me one time in college) didn't go through this and wonder if there was a future there.  However the others like, He Doesn't Want to Marry You, while not correct for every man, really makes you think if its YOU or MARRIAGE he just doesn't want.  And if you're guessing which it is, I suggest you back away very fast!  And of course there is the section in here for guys.  Which I suggest guys read the entire book incase one of you is doing something thinking you are cool, only to find out you're giving the wrong signals (I've seen it happen).<br /><br />So while this isn't true for every guy, some instances are dead-on!<br /><br />And, the book is by far better than the movie of course!!
1416596097|3.0|I read and enjoyed Le Carre's early books. Great characters and he had a story to tell and did it well. A Spy Who Came In From the Cold, Smiley's People, Little Drummer Girl, were excellent reading that reached a believable, tragic ending. But since I read The Constant Gardener he has lost my interest. In this book, A Most Wanted Man, he took a long time to develop the characters, and he did a good job. The story line was also going well. But the ending looks like he wasn't sure how to make it happened, but he had to vent his obvious disdain for the US. It sounded like a Cold War ending from one of the eastern block countries, maybe East Germany and the Russians. That may have been believable. This ending is really unbelievable in today's world and even in 2008. The Germans under Chancellor Merkel would never put up with such a blatant dismissal of human rights and overstepping of their authority; and the US would not perpetrate such a brazen act against such authority of one of her allies. He solicits compassion for the third world Muslims and is successful in developing Issa as a man who needs help and is basically good, but leaves doubt and justifies the suspicious attitude of the Western world with Dr. Abdullah and his devious way of diverting funds to other than charitable organizations i.e. terrorists. He needs to let go of his anger and develop more believable endings. I agree with one of the previous comments. \\"I think Mr. Le Carre's cynicism has robbed him of his empathy and replaced it with justifiable anger and fear.\\" Mr. Le Carre is out of his element in dealing with the current intelligence communities and their fight against terrorists who share none of his compassion or pity even for lives of fellow Muslims.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Hi, my perpective on the series is somewhat biased due to my involvement as an extra. It was a lot of fun and an opportunity to meet all sorts of interesting people on set.   The series does contain a lot of violence and deserves the R18 rating mainly for that. There is nudity and sex scenes but they are not pornographic or overdone in my view. There is a certain amount of bad language throughout the series that I felt didn't add much and could have been avoided without affecting the impact of the dialogue. The violence is, at times, the most extreme I have ever seen on a TV series and does reduce the size of the audiance that the series is suitable for. I'm certainly careful who I recommend it to and always warn them that it is not for the faint hearted.  I thought the series improved considerably as it went on. The story line in the first three episodes seemed a little slow and the CGI looked very fake to the point it distracted me from the story at times. The Pit was a particulaly dark episode and the violence was disturbing, but from there on the shock factor seemed to lessen and the intrigue of the story and the early work on character development started to pay off. I did enjoy it and do recommend it to you conditional to what I have said and I do hope the second series goes ahead.   ...and yes, Lucy is just as beautiful in the flesh as she seems on screen.
0394873742|5.0|Great book. Got it when our boys were very young. Got again for our great niece (didn't want to give ours away). You'll want to keep for your grand kids and great grand kids. (Also great as a ramp for racing matchbox cars and Tech Decks).
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|The case is a decent quality and seems to fit the headset reasonably well.  I bought it for protection of the device when I am not wearing it and for that it is fine.
0393324818|5.0|Nonfiction author Michael Lewis has written on a variety of subjects, and chose what may at first glance appear to be a rather mundane one for \\"Moneyball\\": an in-depth study of the Oakland A's front office in the early 2000s (especially the year 2002).  What makes this subject so compelling, as chronicled by Lewis, is that it is simultaneously a riches-to-rags-to-riches American success story about a complex individual (A's general manager Billy Beane) and a story of enlightenment as Beane and his staff of mavericks apply the teachings of revolutionary outsiders and effectively bring the scientific method into the world of baseball.    The A's success on the field in the late 1990s and early 2000s, competing against teams with payrolls as much as four times their size, motivated Lewis to try to learn how they were achieving this success.  What he found is an amazing story, with Billy Beane as the central figure.  Beane, highly touted as a baseball prospect, failed miserably as a major league player. By rejecting the system, the teachings and the men who molded him as a player, he achieved great success as the A's general manager.  To gain a competitive edge, Beane turned instead to radical thinkers outside the inbred baseball system. Those outsiders preached what is today the fairly well-known baseball methodology of sabermetrics, which applies science, math and statistics to explain what happens on a baseball field and to determine the best strategy for in-game and personnel management. Since the A's were the first team to put sabermetrics into practice, it initially brought them much success.    Michael Lewis is a skilled nonfiction author with a flair for finding the drama in real life situations and bringing it to life. He provides the write level of detail, without going overboard. His prose is well-paced, and as a result \\"Moneyball\\" is a pleasure to read.    It is interesting to read Moneyball in the year 2010 - it stands the test of time.  Not every minor league prospect described in the book has gone onto greatness, but it does foreshadow many subsequent events, such as the Boston Red Sox finally breaking the Curse of the Bambino by applying sabermetrics.    This book is a must read for any baseball fan, serious or casual.  Readers with no interest in baseball, who are only willing to read one baseball book a decade, would do well to choose \\"Moneyball\\". And anyone unwilling to read any book about baseball can wait for the forthcoming Hollywood movie starring Brad Pitt.
142311339X|5.0|What I loved about the Percy Jackson series was how easy it was to read and understand. This new series, The Heroes of Olympus, was similar that way. Reading books for me is like going to another world, and this was one world that I didn't want to come out of.<br />It was difficult for me to get used to the constant switching of point of views between the three main characters. I always got frustrated when I wanted to read more in the point of view of a particular character. However, I read it very quickly and it didn't seem long before that character came back. None of the characters were the same and were all equally lovable. The book was very good, impossible to put it down, and the plot was satisfyingly twisted and creative. The next book doesn't come out until next fall. I wish I had savored it a little longer!
0061876747|5.0|This book starts out a little slowly but really builds up as it progresses.  I like that better then authors that seem to get out all their ideas in the first half.  I was so concerned for the hero that it seemed quite painful at first, but got over that hump as did the hero :).
B002JVWR4U|4.0|The final season of dollhouse ends satisfactorily enough. A few more extras would have been nice but otherwise the DVD is in good quality.
B004132HZS|5.0|I have been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories since I was able to read them. I have always thrilled to the way Holmes solved crimes using the \\"powers of his mind\\". I was quite ready to dislike this modern re-make of one of my childhhod heros, but I was pleasantly surprised. The main characteristics I loved are still there Holmes, Watson, murders, London, 221B Bakes Street they are just given a modern day location.<br />  The action was fast paced the re-telling of the story was really good. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were wonderful as Holmes and Watson. All in all I think anyone who is a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes will not be disappointed in this new re-telling. I highly reccomend it.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I give props to the creators' of this film for making a very dangerous stunt with this movie. Excellent filming, acting, fighting scenes, etc. Will purchase the DVD.
055358894X|5.0|I am a real snob when it comes to fantasy and I rarely take the time to review.  It had to be done here though because this book was awesome and just FUN to read.  It all comes together in this book with excellent, intelligent, witty writing; a fast moving story and likeable characters.  There is not the usual unsurprising formulaic fantasy writing.  Loved the thieves and the focus on their complicated plots.  I love having an anti-hero to root for and I was rooting for him all the way.  Loved it!
B003JTHESA|5.0|What else can i say about this masterpiece. I've listened to Maiden for a couple of years now and have heard their entire catalog in and out and the final frontier has got to be one of the most impressive albums ever. Everyone knows that Maiden is now a progressive metal band opposed to the classic maiden from the 80s but some fans are afraid to live that reality. The prog Maiden era was introduced with their comeback album Brave New World in 2000, and it has been up hill since then. Arguably their weakest album from this era is Dance of Death (2003) however AMOLAD (2006) and The Final Frontier (2010) blew people's minds. The Final Frontier is arguably Maiden's best album from the prog era, just slightly better than Brave New World because they take their skill to a whole another level of unfamiliarity and perfection. Personally, i would love to see Iron Maiden end their career on a good note with this album because it's gunna be extremely difficult for them to outdo this great album. Highlight from this album is definitely Adrian Smith and Steve Harris's songwriting as you can see a mixture of AMOLAD, Somewhere In Time and 7th Son of a 7th Son in this entire album. Starblind, Isle of Avalon and When the Wild Wind Blows are the epic masterpieces of this album that really put the icing on the cake for the final frontier. Overall, if you're a true maiden fan you would to BUY this album and support one of the greatest metal bands of all time. The Final Frontier is one of the strongest albums Maiden will ever put out to the world and one of the strongest albums out there period!!
B002ZG98LO|5.0|The Predator film series has finally gotten it right after the deplorable AVP film disasters; this is a back to the basics: suspense, action, horror!  This movie Predators is just about as great as the first Predator movie with Schwarzenegger!  Definitely looking forward to the next installation in the series!
B003VANOFY|5.0|THE QUICK TAKE:  This is an outstanding headset, and would be a great purchase for the hardcore gamer, or music fan who has grown accustomed to the surround sound setup hooked up to his flatscreen TV, and desires a similar but simpler setup for the computer.<br /><br />The sound quality for the Logitech G930 is very good, and the virtual surround sound scheme is wholly convincing.  With crisp, clear, distinct sounds, the headset is a huge advantage in gaming and benefits music listening or music watching.  There are a few minor issues, plus one significant one:  there are no drivers for Mac users, so some features are not available.<br /><br />FOR GAMING:  You will always be able to tell whether an enemy is to your right or left and in front or behind you, whether or not he is visible.  The distinct impression of a source and direction for a particular sound does get muddier the closer it is to the central axis. Although the headset will not produce very low end bass sounds, for the sake of your ears this is probably all the better.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION AND ERGONOMICS:  The headset is solidly built.  Overall it feels quite durable, but also relatively heavy.  Nevertheless, the headset is quite comfortable and well-suited to extending music listening or marathon gaming sessions.  One disadvantage to prolonged use is that the headset completely insulates your ears and it can grow quite hot over time.<br /><br />CONTROLS:  All of the controls are on the left side of the headset, so whether you need to adjust the volume, activate one of the programmable functions, or pull down the microphone, you can keep your hand on the mouse (if you are right handed!).  The streamlined activation of the of the mic is a nice function, as you never need to worry whether it is muted, as moving it into the appropriate position will turn it on or off.<br /><br />RANGE:  I was able to walk around most of my house and listen to music, although interfering walls, ceilings, ceilings, and floors limit wireless range to anywhere between 50% and 90% of its advertised maximum of forty feet.  With that said, I was able to use the headset in parts of my basement, even though my computer is on the second floor.  Unobstructed, I imagine you may be able to use the headset farther than forty feet.<br /><br />BATTERIES AND CHARGING:  Prolonged use is definitely possible, as the headset retains a relatively long battery life and can easily be charged while in use.  While it may be advantageous to charge and listen at the same time, this requires two USB ports in total (one each for the charger and receiver).  Although the charging dock for the headset features an additional port, it will not support the dongle used to wirelessly connect the headset, which may be slightly problematic for some.  The charging cable itself is more than long enough to support just about any wired connectivity but winds very neatly into the dock when not in use.<br /><br />MAC OS ISSUES:  There are no Mac OS drivers, so this might not be the best option for Mac users.  Although the secondary functions of the headset, such as programmable keys, are not compatible with Mac, you can plug and play with no problems, so long as you do not need access to those functions.<br /><br />Finally, see the video near the top of the page for a quick overview, it will help a little to understand some of the features.between 50% and 90% of its advertised maximum of forty feet.

0553804367|3.0|Prior to reading \\"A Briefer...\\" I had read \\"A Brief...\\" which mentioned several deep and complex theories of the universe quickly and left me slightly confused (i.e. the shape of the universe, God, String Theory...) due partly to its brevity.       I read \\"A Briefer...\\" five or so years later and found the \\"read\\" to be quick and easy to digest and quite clear in its points. Hawking writes a chapter on Quantum Gravity (reconciling Einstein's theory of Gravity with Quantum physics). He points to conclusions but he leaves me curious and wanting more information about this new theory. In many ways, I wish he would write \\"A not so brief history of time\\" to add more \\"meat\\" to the topics discussed which again discuss both God, The Meaning of Life and String Theory. He also discusses Einstein's theories in details that would help a college student taking a class in Modern Physics. Hawking also discusses other very early but important physicists.        I would recommend this book to a non-scientist with the patience and interest to learn some modern physics.
