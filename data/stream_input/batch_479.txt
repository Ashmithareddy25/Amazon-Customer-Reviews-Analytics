B0007O38F8|3.0|I had to put a rating in here to even submit what I have to say, truth be told I haven't heard this particular album yet, I will soon burn it from a buddie of mines, and besides, I'm not even the biggest 50-cent fan, I'm a fan of underground cats like MF Doom aka Viktor Vaughn, Co-flow, Kool keith, etc., anyhow, I just wanted to comment on the stupid statement made by an individual...for anyone to speak badly about 50-cent talking about money, broads, and cars, and then claim Biggie and Pac are nice, and claim to like real rap, the classics, if I'm not mistaken, those cats talked about the same type of sh**, especially Biggie, you need to listen to those boastful lyrics again I see, as for Pac, true he was a revolutionary in his time, but even he was capable of rapping about money, clothes, and hoes (automobiles)....check what you say...we're all hypocrites at times, but sheez, don't make it so obvious, last thing, the real rap, true rap, whatever you want to call it, is alive and well on the underground scene....peace
B00008PX8P|5.0|I had the good fortune of seeing Led Zepplin \\"live\\" 7 or 8 times in my life. I'm 55 years old and first saw them at \\"Texas International Pop Festival\\" in Dallas, Labor-day weekend 1969. Three days and nights, and close to 400,000 plus people. It was put on about 3 weeks after Woodstock by the same people, even better than Woodstock, in many ways. Anyways, that was the first time I ever saw them, blew my mind!  <br />   This 2-DVD set is the first film or video source that actually shows people how unbeleivably good they we're. When the \\"Song Remains the Same\\" came out, I though it was good but it didn't even come close to capturing the energy and all out power and greatness that Led Zepplin portrayed in concert. In fact on that film they appeared a little burned out. I often said to my friends it was a shame that it didn't capture the \\"true\\" Led Zepplin. Well, this one comes pretty darn close. It's not like sitting on the second row, but it might be the next best thing. I will tell you, if you ever did sit on the second row, I did, or anwhere in the concert, you we're in awe and total dis-belief that any one could ever be that good. <br />    This double DVD is better than anything I ever thought would come out. Led Zepplin was the best rock and roll band I ever saw, and this dvd set proves it. I have a 24 year old son, who plays lead guitar in a rock and roll band, and now he says to me that he had no idea that what I was telling him all these years about Led Zepplin was true, but he's a beleiver now. <br />  My recomendation is that this was the best $22.00 I ever spent, and if your a fan of the studio Led Zepplin albums, you'll love this DVD set. Five stars all the way.
B0007P3582|2.0|50 Cent is one of the most publicized rappers of all time.  He's like the Michael Moore of rap, wherever he steps controversy arises.  What is up with well respected rappers making horrible albums as of late?  First, many were left disappointed with Eminem's \\"Encore\\" attempts which hardly left fans feeling satisfied.  And while 50 brought it on his two singles \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"Candy Shop\\" those two songs are hardly good enough reason to buy this album.<br /><br />\\"Candy Shop\\" is his lead single, which is a great song.  It's great for many reasons, because 50 seemed to actually care about it, Olivia is a promising RnB diva in waiting, and the violin instrumentals give it that great touch.  But else where on this album, it all falls flat.<br /><br />While \\"Piggy Bank\\" may have an awesome beat and it's fun, he makes himself out to be more of a pig than ever.  He calls out Fat Joe, Jadakiss, Shyne, Lil' Kim, Kelis, Nas... what have they ever done?  Just because Fat Joe and Jadakiss worked with Ja Rule gives him no real ligament reason to call them out.  Lil' Kim and Nas could tear 50 apart if they were to ever get on mic and battle it out.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the album, \\"Gatman and Robin\\" even Eminem who is a highly successful and talented rapper (despite his last album) couldn't save this song.  \\"In My Hood\\" was dreadful to the point I wanted to pull out my ears.  This whole album was horrible.  In his first album, though he would have never been my favorite, he still brought it and I respected that.  But this album just crashed and burned.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Jesus was nothing more than a petty criminal (at least according to Roman law at that time) who was rightly executed under Roman law.  Jesus was a criminal and not the son of God!!  <br />
B00028HBKC|5.0|The reviewer who touts himself as an intellectual (who lacks basic typing skills), made a few large assumptions.  You speak freely of truth and reality, yet you dismiss religion wholeheartedly.  The problem with this is that without religion or philosophy of any kind, truth and reality have no definition.  By this I mean that religion and philosophy define truth for us in terms that aren't redundant.  If you define truth or reality as the things that happen to us every day, then you are simply saying that truth and reality are only those things of which we are aware.  That is a very limited view of reality.  However, if you broaden your view of truth and reality to include those things outside or our awareness, then you shoot your evidential argument full of holes.   <br />This movie shows a part of the truth of the life, death, and ressurection of Jesus Christ.  The whole truth is that his death on that Cross was meant to atone for the sins of everyone.  However, the reality is that only those who believe in Him will receive that atonement and a personal relationship with the God that created reality and truth.   <br />Here is your challenge.  I challenge you to read Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis, and Jesus Among Other Gods by Ravi Zecharias.  Both men are/were scholars; both men believe/d in the truth and reality of the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ as depicted in The Passion of the Christ.
B0006U4UAU|5.0|I did not know i liked disco untill i bought this album. LCD soundsystem is sweet. My favorites would be Yeah (pretentious mix), and Losing my Edge, but they really pull off everything they try on this record. Give them a try.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This is possibly one of my favourite albums - period. The melodies beautiful, the harmony, arrangements.etc were well beyond their time. For a record released in 1966, it sounds amazing on CD. A far superior album to either Sgt. Pepper's and a bit better than Rubber Soul, there are only a couple of songs I don't really like. A tiny gripe I have with the album the melodies on songs such as Do you still believe me are a bit repetitive. Although nonetheless very good. Btw the song 'God Only Knows' is often cited as the album's best but personally I would rank it about 3rd or 4th on the album.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Unquestionably Tull's greatest, I was fortunate enough to be at their concert at the ABC theatre in Exeter England the day this was released. They opened with Ian Anderson's understated tones \\"this is our new single, it was released today --- it's a bit long\\". Absolutely amazing show, never to be forgotten, and performed excellently on the studio version too. One of the 10 greatest progressive albums, and one that you could say is responsible for starting the progressive rock genre.
B00005JMUA|4.0|ANd again, it is both a satire of the action film genre while honoring it.  The fight sequences are really good, as are the actors, who imply very well developed characters in very brief moments in a scene.<br /><br />I liked these films, but will not view them over and over again like I have others.  I guess I just don't enjoy the rock em sock em ultra-viol like I did as a kid, but there also isn't any depth to hold onto here.  Thus, this simply is not as good as Jackie Brown or the inimitable Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />Kill B is the ultimate comic book superhero killer type stuff.  It has its place, but it is definitely throw away.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0007O38F8|4.0|I'm not a BIG fans of 50 Cent last album,  Get Rich or Die Tryin',  I can tell you more than 10 albums which better than Get Rich in 10 sec.!  but I quite enjoy that album,  50 got lots of nice beat and his voice somehow got some charm!  How don't love his hit like PIMP, 21 Questions, Many Men, If I Can't?  And Sure In Da Club, no doubt baby!   That's one of the most popular rap song ever!  But after that Huge Sale,  After In Da Club, well you know, I don't believe he can make one mo' In Da Club, don't even Dre can do too!  Does 50 Still got it?    Now he release this album,  I'm sure it AT LESS sale 3 Mill!    And After listen whole (...) once,  it doesn't disappoint!  And no surprise too!  I don't expect a classic but at less it don't suck or flop!    In My Hood - I like this one! 4/5    This is 50 - Nice beat! nice one! 4/5    I'm Supposed to Die Tonight - Produce by Eminem and I'm worry about this one at first,  But luckily it don't suck like lots of Eminem works!  It's like a Many Men 2, quite nice! 4.5/5    Piggy Bank - A Diss song with a quite hot beat!   A Diss to Jada, Ja Rule, Fat Joe, Nas and  Kelis too!  One thing I'm sure,  If 50 want beef want war,  He got some wrong people to fxxk wit'!  I'm sure Fat Joe, Jada and Nas will kill him with lyrics,  50 can top anyone of them,  He can only win Ja barely!  And 50 can't even diss them too,  few weak rhymes,  talk about I sell more than you.  Come on man, I know you a rich you ballin'  but Money can't buy respect!  50 Can't win! 3.5/5    Gatman and Robin - Suck like it's title! 2/5    Candy Shop - Produced by Scott Storch,  A guy who did Lean Back!  I feel this beat sounds so much like Lean Back!  And I think Lean Back is way better!  Althoguh it's still tight!  But the hook is quite boring!   I wondering why let this song be the first single? 4.5/5    Outta Control - A beta got a Marching feel,  Produced by Dr. Dre, But not as good as In Da Club or Heat! 4/5    Get In My Car - Smooth beat by Hi-Tek! 4/5    The Ski Mask Way - A More Commercial beat, a radio friendly song! 4/5    A Baltimore Love Thing - 3/5    Ryder Music - 3/5    Disco Inferno - The hottest song in this album! 5/5    Just a Lil Bit - Yeah! Unqie beat by Scott Storch!!! 4.5/5    Guns Come Out - 2.5/5    My Toy Soldier - Em Production! 4/5    Position of Power - I like this one! 4/5    Build You Up - Hot beat by Scott Storch once again!  Scott will be the next big thing, I'm sure! 5/5    God Save My Style - Tight song!!!! 4.5/5    So Amazing - Commercial Song, nahmean?  Melodic beat, female chorus, Sounds great! 4.5/5    Talking About Me - Hot! 4/5    Hate it or Love it - Feat. whole G unit! Nice! 4/5    Get Rich is better little bit!  The Massacre is still good,  50 Cent fan this is a must have!  Nice album worth to get!    Bottom Line,  I wish Dr. Dre drop few more beats!
B00005JMEW|4.0|If you don't mind all the graphic violence - severed limbs flying through the air, spurting blood, etc - this is a very fun and funny martial arts film.<br /><br />It is like Tarantino took elements from every sock 'em / cut 'em film he ever enjoyed and wound them together in a rollicking good story.  Uma Thurman is great and, while unbelievably super, is convincing enough for you to forget that it is impossible to face down, say, 40 sword- and mace-wielding contract killers in a go.  Indeed, Thurman is as beautiful as ever, and this time deadly.<br /><br />Recommended.  Just keep the barf bag nearby.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best cds released this decade.  Well paced, heartfelt, and honest.  The best way I can sum up the sound is Art Pop.  I also saw them live in Philadelphia, and their live show is incredible as well.  A must have cd.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This movie asked me a deep question in general about people <br />Why do we hurt one another? <br />Well this movie has all the hurt and unhappiness all boiled together to destroy a person. If u think this movie is a chick flick, romantic comedy.. it isn't. Be prepared. It has mature contents for people who can handle it. The movie has the style of a stage play that brilliantly does it well in front of a camera. the music is great as well. But the greatest grade goes towards the acting. Just high class acting all around. Everyone has a personality not etched in writing. sometimes its hard to tell who is the good person and the bad person. I believe its human beings who think they have love  all figured out-- just end up hurting one another. If the main goal was love,, why does it destroy them? interesting question? the movie also has a great deal of symbolism and edge . Provacative, and tricky . If you pay attention and do a character study on each character , without over analyzing ,, you'll come with interesting ideas. But the cool thing about this movie is that its like a puzzle. The movie spans between 3-4 years. And it jumps from scene to scene. So the audience member is responsible for filling in the gaps/..  <br /> <br />I recommend this film very much. However if u are not into provacative issues,, don't see it. It might not be for you.
B000001DYJ|3.0|I give it 3 1/2 stars. A live CD that many of us never thought would see the light of day. 'Alive III' was produced by long-time producer Eddie Kramer. A few old fans here and there might be a bit let down, but for the most part, 'Alive III' is decent. Total of sixteen cuts, with a running time at 67:26 as there's just four early tunes here, \\"Deuce\\", \\"Watchin' You\\", \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\". That's okay. As for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the later material as well, \\"Unholy\\", \\"Creatures Of The Night\\", \\"Lick It Up\\" and \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" (after all these years, I'm used to it anyway). No, 'Alive III' isn't as great as the first 'Alive' record. But then again, did you really expect it to be?
1878424319|4.0|The Four Agreements presented in this book are fantastic. They are simple, easy to put into practice, and they make a difference. It's too bad that the rest of the book is filled with New Age spiritual mumbo jumbo and meaningless platitudes. (I don't take it personally, though . . .)  This \\"filler\\" material made it hard for me to trudge through the book.
0345440900|4.0|Let me start with saying that I owned six baby sleeping books. This one will be my top pick given the content it has. However I actually did not follow the EASY method in this book but my baby is sleeping through the night at 3 months.  <br />I find it hard to fit my baby into any schedule, he was crying for whole month when we tried to put him to bed at 9pm, and finally one advise from the 'no cry baby solution' book helped us realize that  an earlier bedtime works better; and sure my baby went to sleep in minutes once we adjust his bedtime to 8pm. <br />This is a good book, but no one book can tell you all about your kids, so get a couple of them and try to understand your baby and react accordingly.
B000000H42|5.0|Mercyful Fate was the band that set the bar for all other black metal bands that followed, and it was \\"Don't break the oath\\" that allowed them to set it.  There are very few modern black metal bands that can match the evil intensity of Mercyful Fate, and ther are none that can match their talent and musicianship.  The vocals are unique and frightening, and the dual guitars are amazing.  Hank Sherman and Michael Denner are capable of producing incredible shredding leads while at the same time creating enticing melodies.<br /><br />If you need a definition of what black metal really IS and what it is really about, buy this record.  It is dissimilar from Scandinavian black metal that followed (Great bands such as Mayhem, Emperor etc.) but this is record without doubt the most influential recording for the black metal scene, as well as other genres, such as thrash (Metallica and Slayer are well known Mercyful Fate fans).  A more extreme, haunting, and lasting heavy metal work there is not.<br /><br />This Cd is well worth picking up (if you can handle it) and I give it my highest recommendation.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|when I crank up this record.  It is a very well crafted record, and \\"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\\"  is perhaps the amoung the catchiest songs of the new millenium.  The most fantastic part of this 2 Disc collection of LCD Soundsystem's works is that it also contains the previously only available in semi-difficult to dig up single form \\"Losing My Edge.\\" This song is wicked catchy and has teriffic tounge in cheek humor about it.  (Side Note: if you want to know why they are so excited about Daft Punk playing at thier house, pick up \\"Discovery\\" by Daft Punk, that record will put a smile on your face and a wiggle in your booty for hours)
B000006045|5.0|Here's the best of Trip Hop(OK some ppl may say Portishead's Dummy or Massive's debut Bluelines....but for ppl like me who are crazy about the dark ambience of this album...the best will always be Mezzanine).  There's just one more thing i'll say...if u buy this album then this will be one of the best decisions u made in ur life:-)
B000069HK2|5.0|I first heard about these guys last year from a friend of mign, and have been completely blown away by there god givin talent to make great music. from start to finish this C.D is amazing. Not only did they have to over come homelessness, and drug abuse, but they also had to over come growing up in one of the most conservative states in the nation. this a graet C.D for whatever mood you are in, it has its harder and heavier songs such as Maybe Mermories, and Box of Sharp Objects and both of those songs are awsome, but then if you are into something softer try Poet Tragedy, On My Own, and Blue and Yellow, I give this C.D 5 stars out of 5 simply put like the title says simply amazing!
B0007P3582|2.0|man i used to really like 50 when he dropped 'gte rich or die tryin' and he was solid in the 'beg for mercy' album with his homeboys g-unit, he had some fire tracks in the new Game album, (how we do, hate it or love it, westside story) so i had big expectations for 'the massacre'. But it really disipoints me, i mean he talks about the same old s***, he doesn't give us anything new, i mean don't get me wrong, there are some really good tracks here, like my fav. 'Boltimore love thing' and 'gatman & robin' 'i'm supposed to die tonight' 'piggy bank' 'outta control' 'position of power'. But when i read his latest interview 50 said 'the massacre' is better then 'get rich' and i strongly disagrre, 'get rich' was a classic but this one is not even a good album. But i guess it will still sell because of who he is and 'cuz of all the beef his involved in and he did a big mistake by droppin The Game from his crew. Anyway if u are a true 50 fan then you'll probably like this but i didn't, so just listen to it first before buyin it. <br /> <br />OUTLAW

Even though she has red hair in the movie, Alieen Quinn never had red hair in real life, that was just a wig! Carol Burnett won Academy award for best actress as Miss Hannigan, she doesn't really hate children.  She took Alieen Quinn under her wing on the set.

Then there's Miss Grace, Punjab, & good ol' Sandy!

Hope this review helped!JM.
6304698526|5.0|BULLITT is today an easy film to underrate, partly because so many films in the seventies embraced a similar narrative and visual style.  This lends the film a sense of familiarity that it didn't have for most viewers in 1968.  Instead of a direct, involved form of narrative, the film employs an indirect, detached one.  Unlike most film where the action takes place at firsthand, much of the action in this one takes place at secondhand, such as when Bullitt and a hotel employee knock on the door of a room, to cut away to a long shot of his girlfriend sitting in her car, her attention soon called to a police siren and running police officers, letting her and us know that something is amiss.  Or the action will often be squeezed to the side, with the screen dominated by something other than the actors, such as the chase near the end on the airport runways, where an airliner will dominate the frame, while one of the actors will be on the periphery.  The whole technique is so cool and detached that one expects the Dave Brubeck Quartet to break out at any point.  The film is also enhanced visually by a complete lack of dissolves through out.  Instead, each shot cuts directly to another, giving the film an almost undefinable crispness.  The whole film is, in fact, a technical delight, with everyone trying to remake as many rules as possible.<br /><br />The film is most famous, of course, for what is quite probably the greatest car chase in movie history.  The only other contender for the slot is not quite a car chase, but the car chasing the subway in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, a film that was profoundly influenced by BULLITT in a host of ways.  There have been dozens of chase scenes since then that are more spectacular in their stunts and effects, so what makes this one remain so compelling?  First, there is the balance to the whole thing.  It builds beautifully, first with two hit men in their Dodge Charger trailing Bullitt in his Mustang, then their losing him, only to rediscover him in their rearview mirror.  Although they are at this point at normal speeds, the effect if riveting, and when the driver of the charger takes a moment to put on his seatbelt, you know you are in for something special.  1968 was before the 1973 oil embargo, so gas efficiency was of secondary concern.  Instead, a string of cars were made with power their main concern, and although these were modified automobiles, they nonetheless seem almost alien with their massive engines.  But what really makes this car scene extraordinary is the devotion to realism.  Most subsequent car chases feature cars vaulting other vehicles, making impossible leaps over bridges, performing astonishing stunts on two wheels or doing an entire rotation, and in every instance landing back on all four wheels with minimal damage.  In this scene, they literally wreck the cars.  Yeah, they vault over a hill, but when they land, you can feel the shock to the chassis.  Also, the speeds are simply incredible.  A lot of scenes feature slower cars that they then enhance in the editing room to make them seem faster.  There are reports that the two cars in this one often exceeded 110 mph.  I don't doubt it for an instance.  In defense of other car chases, one reason they have to resort to pyrotechnics and gimmicks and absurd stunts is that in a sense BULLITT took what it was possible to do with two cars chasing each other as far as it could go.  Whenever I rewatch this chase scene, I can't help but thinking that I will never see its like again.<br /><br />This isn't a film that is going to appeal to everyone.  Many are going to feel uncomfortable with its detached style, with its refusal to bring all the salient parts of the action to the foreground.  But I find its attempt to do something new and original enormously exhilirating.<br /><br />This is rightfully regarded as one Steven McQueen's best films, if not his best.  It is certainly one of the more laconic performances one will see in the genre.  Although Clint Eastwood would later travel much of the same ground (literally, since the films were also set in San Franciso in the Dirty Harry movies, both Frank Bullitt and Harry Callahan were loosely based on the same real life detective), nothing like his grimaces or taglines can be found in McQueen's performance.<br /><br />My one complaint with the film is what I consider to be a rather large hole in the plot.  When Bullitt and his partner go to the airport to pull Ross off his flight, only the two of them go.  It has always been police procedure to undertake such operations in force.  It is simply inconceivable that only two detectives would attempt such an action.  They would go in with substantial backup.  For me it is one of the only misfires in an otherwise superb film.the genre.

Its got a great sound even if you don't get what the songs are about. Reminds me of the early 80's stuff with a touch of painkiller in it.Well worth the buy if your a heavy metal fan. Also check out the new Exodus, Megadeth and Kreator for something more heavy also check out Iced earth if you liked Priest old singer
0670033375|4.0|For several years I have been whingeing that this book should be written. Now it has, hot off the presses - January 2005. <br /> <br />I have read about half of the book so far. Usually, I wait until I have completed a book and mulled it awhile before commenting on and reviewing it. However, I think the lessons of this book are so important that I am going to recommend it without waiting my usual process. <br /> <br />This book, Collapse, is ponderous at times, but it is vital that the data gets `out there' as soon as possible. Collapse is at least good enough to serve the purpose and that is enough for me lacking anything else since the rapidly dating A green history of the world. <br /> <br />One month later! <br />While Jared Diamond does refer in passing to specific industries from his own knowledge, such as oil, mining and forestry, his discussion of the nuts and bolts of ecology is much more limited than is Ponting's. The strength of the book is in the collecting together of large numbers of case studies of previous collapsing societies and societies under stress.  <br /> <br />Several reviews have waxed lyrical about the 100 of 550 pages that are devoted to difficulties in Norse lands. As far as I am concerned, the book would have been better without it. Diamond writes in lifeless, tedious prose, and struggling through the book I regard as hard work. In fact, he could have lost yet another hundred pages to great advantage. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, as with so much poorly written science popularisation, this is probably the best you have at the moment. It does not, however, fully surplant Ponting's work, reviewed below. In summary, the prime value of this book is in the case studies, which fortunately comprise the bulk of the book. Unless you are coming new to this area, better to regard this work as a data source, than to bring expectations of theoretical insight to the joy of reading it.
B0006399FS|3.0|This follows the typical U2 formula. 11 songs, about 6 that are upbeat, 4 that are either romantic ballads, reflective, or slower tempo, and one that is a spiritual message. It has been done before MANY times from this band. It's been done again. If you feel you need another album with this sound, pick it up. But if you have their older stuff, there is no real reason to add this one.
B00004RIV4|5.0|The most interesting and arresting thing about this band is their quirky creativeness. The songs here are an odd and ambient collection (forever the soundtrack to a marevellous Greek holiday for me now!) Each track has it's own distinct style and personality and yet each is catchy, infectiously melodic and lyricaly, just the right side of sane.<br /><br /> Murphy's voice is full of range and surprise, it can be harmonious and completely shock at once.<br /><br /> Really great and different stuff, a delightful break from the mainstream, I defy you to find any bands doing similair stuff!<br /><br /> Highlight tracks are the beaty and heady, \\"Bring it Back\\" and the deliciously insightful \\"Absent Minded Freinds\\", a wry look at modern relationships.

He has done for autism what the TV series \\"Monk\\" has done for OCD and what the F.A.T. City workshops have done for dyslexia.<br /><br />As a practicing psychiatrist, I admire the insight that Mr. Haddon has shown into this troubling disorder. As a fiction writer, I admire the unique voice that the author has created in this first person account of a world that is very different from the one most of us know. I have recommended The Curious Incident to patients and families who struggle not only with autism and Asperger's Syndrome, but also to those who struggle with OCD, many features of which overlap with autism, and to those of my patients whom I know enjoy an engaging read.<br /><br />Richard A. Moskovitz, MD, author of [[ASIN:0741421585 Carousel Music]] and [[ASIN:0878332669 Lost in the Mirror, 2nd Edition: An Inside Look at Borderline Personality Disorder]]

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Just wanted to add to the lovefest--really, folks, this is the album of the year, and probably of many other years; it's that passionate, that virtuosic, that catchy, that gorgeous, and I can only hope it manages to cross over and set some heads aspinnin'. Can't really type these kids too well--too many styles on the record, almost all of them pulled off amazingly well and making perfect sense next to each other. If you've heard Broken Social Scene's \\"You Forgot It In People,\\" that'll give you a good idea of what to expect (as far as the passionate eclecticism goes; can't forget the darn-those-precocious-Canadians angle, either), but Arcade Fire is a notch above even them---more beautiful at times, but without losing any of the, well, fire, for lack of a better word (whether it comes out as ferocity, as love, as unchecked grief, as fear, etc.). Maybe Talking Heads is a good reference point, in terms of being able to pull off punky nervousness (all their early stuff), gorgeous despair (\\"Heaven\\"), tropical weirdness (\\"Nothing But Flowers\\"), and ass-shaking club funk (\\"Burning Down the House\\"), each within very-different-sounding songs, all with peerless musicianship. Arcade Fire do it all in one purty lil package, so get it and spread the gospel.
068987474X|1.0|This book is the most degrading thing I have ever read.  The author cleary does not actually LIKE women.  Although I may agree that he is making some points here that we all know and advise that we could all give to our friends, but have a hard time following ourselves, I feel that the way this book is written it is actually extremely insulting.  I would highly recommend reading the book, \\"Be Honest, You're Just Not That Into Him Either\\" by Ian Kerner - who is an actual sex tharapist and psychologist and who can also be very honest, but in a way that at least leaves a woman feeling like he is not calling her an idiot.  His book is much more helpful, this one is not worth your wasted time!!!
B00008PW2D|5.0|I'm quite amazed at some of the reviews, as if the number of shows is what determines if something is good or not.  On quality, I probably enjoyed the 5th season the best, as I watch the show for its comedy not for its soap.  The other 4 seasons were all built around Carrie's self-absorbed (boring) love affairs.  This one dispensed with that format and so we were spared the only part of the show that I don't like.  However, if you watch the show for its soap opera dimension, this season was definitely not for you.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|THE THRASHIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,I AM FORCED TO GIVE A SINGLE STAR!
B000000OS2|4.0|As one reviewer posted, this did not spawn the MTV unplugged era. Bon Jovi did that a couple of years before at the MTV music awards performing Wanted Dead or Alive. Stevie Ray Vaughn was on MTV unplugged in 1989, so no, Tesla did not start the whole unplugged thing. However, this a great album, and for those of you that are fans of unplugged music, this one cannot be overlooked. Signs was the big hit from the album, but I don't think there is a bad song on it. Definitely check it out if you like acoustic music.
0679721037|5.0|John Hersey's poignant novel on Hiroshima is one of the best I've read. Hersey's novel is based on interviews with the survivors of the first atomic bombing, and it instantly draws you into this gritty and devastating event.  This book is more than just a novel; it's an epic.      Dr. Masaku Fujii ran a successful hospital for the sick and old. However as there was a rise in warnings of an American attack on Hiroshima he was unable to take on any more patients. On the day of the attack he was sitting out on his porch reading the local newspaper. Suddenly a blinding light flashed and he was sent flying through the air into a near by river like a rag doll. His story would hold the same similarity as the other survivors; that blinding light. It was like the final flashing warning for a destruction that the world had never seen.      Only the accounts of real people could make this book such an unforgettable story of war, love, and the obliterations upon civilization.  Dr. Masaku Fujii, Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, and Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto all started their day of normally, but by the end of that day their lives would be bound together, and changed, by the events of Hiroshima. Most would lose their wives, husbands, children, jobs, lives, and a resound feeling of protection. However these five would survive this horrible feat of genocidal-fanatics on their city, and they would all tell their stories to John Hersey.      Hiroshima is a true testament of survival and compassion of a nation brought to its knees by the atomic bomb.  This story shines a bright, and personal, light on the events of Hiroshima: brighter than the colossal explosion caused by the bomb. This book is a must read for everyone.
076790592X|5.0|This is the true story of a professor who finds out he is dying and decides to live his remaining days spreading the word that everyone should live each day of their life focusing on the things that really matter. <br /> <br />The appeal of this book is that although it is a very short, easy read, it is chalk full of tidbits to think about.  It is also very emotional as it deals with the author's relationship with this man who was once and became again his mentor.
0800177177|5.0|Well, I haven`t seen Lugosi film, nor Nosferatu (1922, 1979). But when I watched this, I felt it is a perfect movie. I later red the original and, Jesus, this is far more superior. Many people can complain about Keanu Reeves and Ryder. They are just fine. Could have been better? Maybe. But most important thing is if the story is engaging, if it grows within you when you are watching. And it does. Here you can find gothic horror, irresistible seduction, suspense, and love. Action takes place at appropiate pace. There is not a week line in screenplay, which is one of the things than make a film being great.  <br />The plot is much more improved than Stoker's. His 1997 Dracula is interesting: for me it was originmal to write a book in a diary form. Also the vampyrization of Lucy is shown in detail. But I didn`t like Draacula portrait: an evil thing, but a thing: a zoologic curiosity. It is a kind of species that moves to a bigger place because thre is no more food supply and just grew up to have a new living location. Here you can find Dracula is that but also a deeper character: still he is touched by love. In the book, why Dracula attacks Lucy? he want`s an assistant. But why Lucy? was just coincidence, his first victim to be so close to Harker's fiancee? And Coppola may have thought that between the Count  and Mina there was something else than a new victim. So with those elements he developped a more profound, richer plot. Dracula still wants to go to London to find a new food supply, but also perhaps he could have a new chance: to gain his love again: darkness can triumph over death, yes, but also love. With this he achieves PURPOSE, a thing that makes his character be more complete. Thanks, FFC, for improving the original.  <br />So with this improved plot, perfect pacing and superb visuals you have one of the best movies made so far. With this, there is no need to watch non-important details (this or that actor could have done better). Just enjoy.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|Pros: <br /> <br />- Halford and his powerful screams are back (though in a sense given the exact songs, nothing Ripper couldn't have handled either) <br />- Judas Rising <br />- Demonizer <br />- Hellrider <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> <br />- Production is average at best <br />- Not enough Halford Screams <br />- \\"Revoultion\\" is an okay song but some parts of it sound like the legendary Priest-scream type stuff followed Halford's TWO-project vocals - unnecessary mix. <br />- Some obvious filler, not to mention mellow stuff <br />- Not near the \\"all-out assault type\\" of Painkller, Halford's Resurrection album, or even Priest Jugulator. <br /> <br />Overall, Id give it a 7 out of 10.  Not poor by any means, but not KILLER either.
B00009V7P8|5.0|<br />When's the last time you put a new CD on and felt like the speakers were grabbing hold of your ears and commanding you to listen?  If you want to enrich your life, buy this CD. Read on if you must, but that's all you need to know.  I picked up O after reading a magazine article on \\"the best CDs of 2003 you never heard\\".  Recommendations like that usually end up disappointing me.  Not this time.   <br /> <br />In critiquing music we inevitably try to draw a frame of reference that the reader will relate to.  Can't do that here because O is unlike anything you've heard.  It's acoustic not electric, that's the best I can do without pigeonholing it.  This music is just achingly beautiful.  The use of cello, the female backing vocal, the opera singer on \\"Eskimo\\", it all works perfectly.  The arrangemnet and the recording are so up front and personal, it feels like you're attending a private concert in your house. <br /> <br />I'm at a loss to describe how beautiful this music is.  What an absolute breath of fresh air this is in the new millenium.
B00004RF9B|4.0|This is definite a film worth seeing whether you are a sci-fi fan or a student of film. It is one of the \\"serious\\" sci-fi films of the 50's. It is easy to be jaded when watching older sci-fi; a lot were cheaply made and consisted of rubber-suited actor as a monster terrorizing the local populace. However, some films like Forbidden Planet did have high production values and thoughtful scripts. Although I don't think it is as good (or holds up as well) as \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\", this film is still very watchable today. Frequently listed as being loosely based on \\"The Tempest\\", it really uses that as a starting point, because there are myriad other concepts original to this film that have been repeatedly copied over the years. <br /> <br />What I find funny is some of the reviewer of this film. Complaining about the \\"Laughable\\" effects and \\"lame\\" attempts at humor. This film was made in 1956! You need to view in that light; there were no SGI workstations and Lightwave software to create the effects that are so commonplace today. <br /> <br />Several reviewers, including some claiming to be sci-fi fans and the Amazon editorial reviewer, are confused about the robot. Robbie the robot, who first appeared in this film, IS NOT the robot on Lost in Space. That robot wasn't even called Robbie, his name simply was \\"Robot\\". There is no doubt that Robbie served as an inspiration for Robot on Lost in Space, but they are two different robots. Robbie has legs and walks, Robot has tracks and rolls; Robbie has segmented arms and sort of fat fingers, Robot has retractable accordion arms and thin curved pinchers. <br /> <br />I probably should have knocked a half star off for the mediocre transfer, but still worth watching.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has given me chills since I first saw him on a late night show 4 or 5 years ago before he was famous.  Once you hear his voice, you want everyone you know to hear it.  He is truly amazing!  You can listen to all of his cd's in any mood that you are in.  \\"Closer\\" is awesome!  You will get chills when you hear it.  All of the songs are great.
B000024D4R|5.0|--Rating: 99 out of 100-- <br /> <br />The Pink Floyd catalog has many staple albums that transcend musical achievments and put them in the place of not only some of the finest musicians ever, but some of the most influential performers of all time. Whereas Dark Side of the Moon heightened Pink Floyd into its own category, finding them at a crossroads, where their influences could be fully achieved and the concept of the driving forces behind what can draw an individual to insanity are threshed out, (namely love, war, time, and money) Animals is Roger Water's statement on how he sees the world in general, as he seperates everyone into three seperate groups of people: Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep. The beginning and end of the album has one of the most heartfelt beginnings and endings to an album in the history of music as the words coming out of Waters mouth truly drive to the bone making you realize that as the album begins that you are gong to be in for one hell of a ride, as these two songs are some of the closest that Pink Floyd ever got to looking at love in general in a song. Not to say that they never focused on this theme before, but it was just never as fleshed out, as obvious, and as implying towards that feelingas it is done here. <br />However, these two songs could be more considered intros and outros to the album, than an overall idea for what the album as a whole is about, as truly the song structure, and meanings behind the other songs almost make Pigs on the Wing, Parts One and Two more of a veil, hiding what this album is truly about. While Roger Waters isometric views on reality start to truly rear their head on this album, it does not take anything away from it in general, as the musical brilliance this album achieves, along with the highest production values, and soundscapes that Pink Floyd would only top themselves with over and over again (namely Meddle, to Dark Side of the Moon, onto Wish You Were Here, then Animals, and finally reaching the end point at The Wall)would be achieved. In Dogs we are invited into a world wherein the Dogs rule night and day: running the streets , while looking for the next soul to take advantage of, looking for the \\"easy meat\\". While the outlook is grim and the landscape that Waters projects, showcases his continued alienation from others it also offers us some of the deepest insight into Waters continued egomanical personality, and how he continued to strive for complete control over the band in general. That can be seen very obviously in the fact that Waters basically had complete control over this entire album, and his recipe for his themes are fully brought to fruition, as only David Gilmour is credited with the guitar work throughout Dogs, and Waters taking the credit for everything else on the album. <br />This song also takes a stab at peoples morals in general, as well as insighting us to think about how when we are in a job or line of work, that there will always be the one that is trying to one-up you, in this big fish eat the little fish world. We must put on the facade that we are the best, or strive for excellence in everything we do, less we submit to the pressures and extremes that others place on our shoulders, like a burden on our back, much like the \\"stone\\" that drags us down as is noted near midlle of this excelent track. We are asked whether we must fit into this cliche of what our society has become, fitting in with a certain group, and not allowing who we truly are to come through, as we must disquise ourselves from others, as to truly let others know where we are at and what we do, as this could set us back as others could use this to their advantage to bring you down. <br />Pigs is a very obvious stab at government, and political views in general as Waters explains how much of a \\"charade\\" the government and its disciples can and will be, calling Pigs \\"jokers\\", and even going so far as insulting the whitehouse and how it covers up things constantly, with \\"tight lips, and cold feet\\". Another exceptional song that rings even truer nowadays as you truly wonder just how much we are truly being shown the truth, about the war across the ocean and the repurcussions that affect us on a daily basis; especially the governments filtering of information as the guinea pigs in the media report on things that will heighten our reputation and not make us look bad. As Waters remarks \\"you gotta keep it on the inside,\\" we see just what kind of a political statement this artist is able to achieve. <br />True classic albums transcend time and place, and are able to connect with people in ways that music and words normally could not, and Animals as a whole is the epitomy of this achievement, making us look not only at the world around us, but into ourselves as well, as we contemplate moral dilemnas and ourselves as a whole, digging deeper into our subconscious thoughts and finding out more about everything around us day by day. It should be fitting then that one of the final tracks on the album is Sheep, which is roughly about people that follow religion and allow it to lead them aimlessly , just like animals to the slaughterhouse. These sheep have no idea of the dogs wandering around them waiting night and day for the right moment to snatch up their prey, and devour the weak, stepping up into society and creating a place for themselves, regardless of who they hurt in the process. As these people wander around \\"aimlessly\\" unaware of the danger that persists like a growing plaque, the followers and their beliefs are only there to give them support, while the dogs drive is in themselves, to take over what they can, without the help of a savior or having to belive in something of a higher power to get through their life, and their daily routine.  <br />An outstanding comment on society at large, and some of the deepest and most intelectual lyrics ever in an album, Animals is one of the finest accomplishments in music ever, and stands as a true testament as to what can be done with music, and the impact that you can achieve when you lay every card on the table for all to see. A timeless classic that once purchased, will be listened to for years upon years, and is very unlikely to be topped in terms of sheer impact and overall personality. This album redefined what can be done and spoken about in music, and I wait for the day that someone else puts out an album of this calliber, making not only a political, but a social stand on their beliefs. Roger Waters is a genius, and Pink Floyd is one of the best bands ever, period, hands down, without a doubt. Listen to their whole catalog and see the transiton from an experimental psychedelic rock band, to one of the most influential and highly talented groups to ever grace the world. Classic in every sense of the word, not to be missed.
B000002AGB|5.0|The Isle of Wight and Live at Leeds have basically the same track listing, but Leeds is maybe a little better.  I decided to get this because I could get it cheap, and boy is it awesome!  It's everything you could want in a Who concert, the live versions of Tommy songs top the studio versions in my opinion.  One of my favorites is \\"young man blues,\\" one of the most raw and intense versions of the song is found on here.  What follows is a buying guide in accordance with this cd: <br />Live at Isle of Wight has only a couple songs off of Who's Next, so you can get both this and Who's Next without a lot of track repeats.  More than half the songs are off of Tommy, which you should also get because it is nice to have both versions of the songs.  Quadrophenia is of course not represented on here, so it should be acquired also.  Many of the songs on here are sample songs off of their first few cds, \\"magic bus\\" being a nice rare addition to the more well known songs.  You do not need to buy any older cd's, because songs like \\"my generation\\" are given representation in the Isle of Wight playlist.  But you should get Who's Better Who's Best for a good overview of older stuff.

He has many enemies in the school because he is such a good fighter. He finally fights the Buggers and learns the horrible truth.

B000002OZY|5.0|when one listens to this, one is amazed at how much music has degenerated over the last few years.  The opening and intrumental playing is unmatched on any other Who cds, except of course live versions of these same songs.  I have never heard such good playing from a band at this point in history; these guys were probably the tightest and most focused band from the period.  Now the story is a little tricky to follow, but its not the story that is important, its the musical development over the album that makes this one of the greatest rock cds ever made.  I don't have too much trouble following it, but I am a fan of progressive rock, some of which has pretensions that make following the story of Tommy downright easy.  It is remembered as the first \\"rock opera,\\" a term that often draws derision from mags like Rolling Stone, but it paved the way for progressive bands that were willing to challenge themselves and their audience through a complex story in the music.  It was exciting and refreshing when it was released, and it is even more so now.  Just get it!
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has soul to spare and then some. He could give half of it away and still be the best soul singer on the planet. This dude is correct when he says, \\"When it hits you won't know what to do.\\" Because rarely has soul music been this addictive. His music feels inspired. Someone needs to tell radio and everyone that this is what makes a real legend. It has to start with the song. Without a good song there's just a lot of hype. Unlike some singers, John Legend's songs won't come and go with the latest trend. This is a CD that requires listening. You can't just skim through the beats. If you're a listener that's ready for something more than you're average musical fling, then this is the album for you. If you're prepared to take a new soulful journey, then climb on board. It's hard to find a bad song on this record. But for those that are completely unfamiliar, his style is more along the line of Alicia Keys. Although, I think John Legend takes his ambitions a step further. His music invites more obvious comparisons than hers does. Alicia Keys is Alicia Keys. She's pretty much created her own brand and style. While John brings back so many memories of talented male-soul singers that have come before him. John's path might be a little more challenging because of the latter. He's branding his own style and sound also, but it just might take a little longer for people to take noice of what he's doing. I think \\"Get Lifted\\" is a great start for him. The title of legend looks to be within his reach. With this album, he puts himself one step closer.
B00008OWZC|5.0|wow, jimmy pages playing just kills on this live set.  as a big fan of live albums, I knew I had to have this live set.  And it does not dissappoint, taking a great range of songs from their career.  I like the live versions of all the songs almost better then the studion versions.  They are THE rock band, just get it, you have gotta get into this band to get rock music!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you are a hard core Dream Theater fan you will love this CD.  It's probably the heaviest DT CD to date with Awake running a close second.  I don't really have a favorite DT CD.  The newest CD by them is always my favorite.  It's one of the only bands that I look forward to hearing something new from them.  I am out there the first day to buy it, and I know I will love it.  Every CD they put out is a new adventure into progressive rock (metal).  Images and Words was the first DT CD that turned me on to them, and I have bought every CD since then, and I have never been disappointed. Every CD is so different, but you always know that its them.  I seen them live last Summer, and they put on a 3 and a half hour show.  I was blown away.  What a great show.  FYI...  They just finished recording there new CD, and should be out sometime this summer.  I'm looking forward to it, and you should be to..       There are only two other progressive groups out there that even come close to Dream Theater....    Vanden Plas - The God Thing, and Symphony X - The Odyssey.  Two Great Prog Metal CD's..  Vanden Plas sounds a lot like Dream Theater, and Symphony X is like dream theater on speed.  If you like dream theater you will like them.
B00005JM1F|4.0|I loved this DVD. My only problem with it is that the unrated version and the rated version are two seperate DVDs. You can't have the option of both presented to you on one DVD like you can on a lot of other movies with rated/unrated versions. I would have like to seen that on this one. Everything else was great.
B000066NW0|4.0|Not going to go into depth here, but this is a pretty good cd. It's got a number of very catchy songs and Avril can certainly sing.
B00064MW6A|3.0|Catwoman - where do I begin? Well, it's not the worst movie, but certainly wont be a movie that I would consider watching again. <br /> <br />The story starts off with Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a quiet woman, with no self-confidence working in a cosmetics company. She is asked to design a new look for a new product. However, when she goes to meet her boss to return the final draft before midnight, she arrives at the place at a wrong time and sees something she isn't supposed to, leading to deadly consequences. Later, she recovers and acquires new cat-like powers and tracks down her enemies. <br /> <br />Well, let's start off with the plus points of this movie. Halle Berry looks really sweet during the first few minutes of this movie with her long hair while playing the nave Patience Phillips. Even when she gets back at the party people next door (for making too much noise) with her new powers, is nice to watch. However, the whole movie goes downhill when she turns into Catwoman, cuts her hair and wears a disgraceful costume to hide her identity. I have no idea what the costume designers of this movie were thinking; Catwoman is supposed to look sexy and mysterious, but when Halle wears this so-called outfit and uses her whip, she doesn't look, forget graceful, even bearable to watch! Although I wouldn't say she acted her worst in this movie (since none of the other actors acted well anyway), I am definitely baffled as to why she decided to act in this movie in the first place. At least I applaud her for having courage to show up at the Razzies (awards given for the worst films of the year), and accepting her worst actress of the year award with dignity. She can act really well, but she should stop choosing stupid roles for movies like Catwoman and Gothika that could ruin her career. <br /> <br />Another annoying aspect of this movie was the background score/music/soundtrack, whatever you call it. We hear the same background music throughout the whole movie, which makes it really annoying to just watch the scenes. I mean, at least change the music at least in one scene. I feel like I was listening to Mis-teeq's `Scandalous' song throughout the movie. However, I didn't think director Pitof did an extremely terrible job at directing this film, as everyone else says he did. I mean, horrible directing would mean you would have no idea what in the world was going on. The direction was pretty ok, with good special effects, and at least a bit fast-paced. The script on the other hand, well was below average, but not completely despicable. <br /> <br />The last reason as to why I find this movie awkward is because after watching the whole thing, I don't even know whether Catwoman is a good or a bad person. In one scene, she fights robbers who are robbing a jewelry store, and the next minute, she steals the jewelry herself? It doesn't make any sense! Why did the writers even make a script for this movie, if they didn't even know what makes Catwoman special?? <br /> <br />I gave this a 3 - star rating, because as I mentioned, I did like the first few moments of the movie before Halle Berry becomes Catwoman and the special effects of this movie. I expected a disastrous movie after reading the reviews of the critics, but it's not THAT bad, even if it isn't that good either.
B000001FOS|5.0|This is where Yngwie J. Malmsteen (\\"not to be confused with the other Yngwie Malmsteens\\") put it all together. The riffs grooved, the chops had feeling (at least by Yngwie standards), the melodies were accessible, and the lyrics weren't goofy. Okay, they were cheesy just like any other pop rock song, if you're too cool for school and look down upon something like that. But, I'll take cheesy pop over cheesy nonsense D&D lyrics anyday. The older stuff \\"Queen is in Love\\", \\"I am a Viking\\", \\"Disciples of Hell.\\" What the hell was the point of all that? <br /> <br />I'm not going to go back and replace just anything I used to own on cassette tape, but I'm glad I rediscovered this one on CD. Sure, it sounds like a Survivor album on speed, but this is the one studio CD from Yngwie that's all around tasty.
185984054X|4.0|\\"If there is a hell, Hitchens is going there for this book.\\" So said the New York Press in respose to The Missionary Position, subtitled Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice. Written in 1995, during the height of Mother Teresa's popularity, this book was Hitchens' attempt to debunk the myth that was, and remains, Mother Teresa.<br /><br />Written from the perspective of one who clearly is not a Christian, this book has been likened to a cruise missle. It is narrow in scope, yet devastatingly effective, for it strikes right to the heart of the matter. How are we to reconcile Mother Teresa, who cares for the sick and destitute, and Mother Teresa who holds hands and laughs with the wife of a brutal and notorious dictator? How are we to reconcile her desire to live out Christianity when she accepts million-dollar donations from the likes of Charles Keating?<br /><br />The most significant chapter in this book is one which displays Mother Teresa's overwhelming hypocrisy. The author reproduces a letter that was sent from Mother Teresa to Judge Lance Ito, seeking clemency on his behalf. She suggests that while she knows nothing of his business dealings (in which he defrauded people of $250,000,000) what is more important is the service he has rendered to the poor. She asks that the judge to do what Jesus would do, which she evidently believes would be to let him free. Los Angeles deputy D.A., Paul Turley wrote a response to Mother Teresa, suggested that she should return the $1.25 million dollars given to her by Keating, promising he would return it to the rightful owner. He received no response.<br /><br />Many others have written about Mother Teresa and have chastised her for this type of hypocrisy. Many have validated the claims that her care for the poor was more in providing a comfortable place for people to die than in seeking to heal them.

B000002MJR|5.0|I bought this CD in my freshman year just because I liked the radar array on its cover. When I listened it for the first time, I had a feeling that all the songs are long and dull. But since it was my only CD then, I listened to it almost everyday for a month. Then one day, when I found myself familiar with the chords and tones, I realized what a wonderful album it was. The live recording is incomparable, the sound of every instrument is so crystal clear and perfectly mixed that I don't want to compress the CD into MP3 to jeopardize the quality. The pedal steel guitar and the sax added a kinda soulful taste to some of the songs. My favorites are 'Romeo and Juliet','You and Your Frind', 'Your Latest Trick'. It's the album I play when I study late at night or if I want a relief from work.
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a `fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes.<br /><br />The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes.<br /><br />Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \\"The Destruction of Dresdon\\". So it goes.<br /><br />Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life.

B000006045|5.0|What else is there to say about this album? It's just simply astonishing. I'm a fan of dark Trip Hop music and have been for a while. Massive Attack is just one of those pioneer bands that can deliver without missing a beat. I've been aware of this band for a while but never gave them a chance until I picked up this album. From the moment the dark atmosphere settled in, I was taken on a ride with \\"Angel\\" which is just the vibe I've been looking for. The rest of the CD was an experience I wasn't ready for but by the time it got through to \\"Group Four,\\" I was shocked. The female vocalist who sings about three of the four vocalist songs was just perfect. The drums that repeat throughout \\"Inertia Creeps\\" is just another small example of great rhythm in this kind of genre. Everything sounds so hypnotic and tribal and although songs like \\"Man Next Door\\" is just one of the exceptions, it shouldn't stop you from unraveling this masterpiece. \\"Black Milk\\" sounds like it could be the theme song for an underground club somewhere in space. Elizabeth Fraser's haunting voice just rings throughout as you've got this really mysterious orchestra of sounds playing in the background. The title track \\"Mezzanine\\" just blends right in as it sounds like some surreal occurrence down the neighbourhood with hard-hitting drums and eerie scratches. Overall, you just can't pass up such an experience like this. It's just something else and if you like Tricky or Hooverphonic, you've gotta get this.
B00005JMXX|5.0|If President George W Bush did not watch Fahrenheit 911, then we sure hope he accidentally sneaked into Screen #2 to watch that `action looking one' instead. \\"The Day After\\" (1983) (TV) was the original frightening story about the weeks before, during and after a nuclear strike on the United States with the human factor in Lawrence, Kansas. We where all made watch it and it did frighten us. In fact it scared the Jesus out of most of us. It has taken over twenty years for something as realistically possible as \\"The Day After\\" to emerge... and it has a similar name, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", so I have no doubt that the producers and writers of the show probably understand quite well that they are delivering on something just as important as the first one. In other words I see this as the new remake and it is a perfectly bona-fide real world problem issue.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow, is the new `fear the atom bomb' pseudo-documentary science-based live action movie about a real global threat to humanity, this time instead of radiation and nuclear fallout, the message is not even terrorism as the current political model would have us believe, but an environmental catastrophe because of GLOBAL WARMING, The Day After Tomorrow goes at great length to tell us that science predicts these changes to quickly occur and in such rapid succession that there will be an international emergency, in other words we will wait until the last possible second to address the issues at hand, as we are still doing now in 2005, even after a massive tidal wave just wiped out a huge segment of the Far East's population, including many holiday makers, imagine how many more if this had been during the summer period for westerners? It is our duty to stop pretending this is someone else's problem. Nobody will shoot you for becoming a hippy and changing your job style to something a little more on the green side. You are going to have to be doing that anyway in 27 years time when all the oil is gone. Oh yeah and if you look into perpetual motion, free energy systems and hydrogen fuel you can see how problematic things are really going to get.<br /><br />As for the movie, well next to \\"Spider-man 2\\" and the new \\"Appleseed\\" this has some of the best special effects you have ever seen, and really you should watch it for that, some very interesting border activity (why weren't the Mexican immigration and army just popping them all off with sniper riffles really makes you think what probably would have gone on there dude!), funny CGI wolves that sometimes work and then sometimes don't, the plot is almost Independence Day over again except for all the patriotic chest-beating, you have seen much of the flooding before in \\"Deep Impact\\", even the back story of Dennis Quaid making his way to New York to find his missing son is hooky, Ian Holmes character the only sense of a real person, the environmental disaster is what you believe in, not necessarily the plot, a five star film because it gets an important message across loud and clear, we can not go on living like we are as a world of energy wasting polluters without receiving some payback.is gone.

0743201140|5.0|I was recommended this book but did not pick it up after buying it for some time.  Once I did pick it up I had trouble putting it down. <br /> <br />The focus on this book is how to discover your strengths using a Gallup online 45 minute timed evaluation.  This gives you your top 5 core strengths with an explanation and examples.  Now, if this was all the book gave me then I would have given it maybe 3 stars.   <br /> <br />However, the book explains in detail how we are required to focus our lives both personal and professional on these core strengths.  They are the key to getting a life we want to live.  I have to agree.  <br /> <br />There is a brilliant introduction as to how our brains develop and in turn creat unique individuals with unique talents and abilties.  Yes I know it may sound corny and very self help oriented but it was an eye opener for me. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00006I8TW|5.0|So yesterday I was watching 'Remember The Titans' and I said to myself,\\"This movie has unbelievably good music in it.\\"  So today I was lookin at music, and thought to type in Remember The Titans, and this cd came up.  Unbelievable how good it is.  Charles Wright, The Temptations, the dramatic classical music from the movie that I love, Cat Stevens.  So good.
0151008787|5.0|As I read this book, I alternated between laughing out loud and weeping uncontrollably - not only for Amos Oz's private tragedy, but also for the larger tragedy of our joint history.  This book provides an intimate personal description of some of the most dramatic periods in the history of Israel and Jerusalem.  The writing is remarkable.  I wish I could have read it in the original Hebrew, but de Langes translation is great.

B00004W52U|5.0|THE best punk (I know, I know, it's \\"ska punk\\") album of the last twenty years.  The energy, the emotion, the musicality- nothing else even comes close.   And unlike a lot of punk/hardcore classics, this hasn't dated or aged a bit. It still sounds incredible.  And if, by some bizarre chance, you are reading this and you do not already own it, go and get it now. I mean IMMEDIATELY.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200, just go.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Before I give my thoughts on the movie away I want to address certain problems that have arisen here. First of all, there seem to be several persons who're creating numerous accounts to bash this movie and to insult those who believe in what is called Christianity. Now I'm not a Christian, I'm not a believer of any kind, but I do know the words respect and tact. The reviews in question (Written by the same...person) were as obnoxious as it can get. the thing is that all that guy wants to do is upsetting people. I'm glad that nobody is reacting to that garbage because that is all that little twit wants: Attention. Now why do I think that these obscene and rude comments don't belong here? They violate Amazon's guidelines in every way (I already wrote to Amazon about this), they are rude, obnoxious, filled with prejudiced generalisations, ignorant \\"research\\" (Ever READ the historical evidence?)... As for some history: No matter how many idiots repeat the nonsense posted here, Jesus did exist and no he was not made up. (I guess the Romans wouldn't write about a fictional character, even if THAT was the only argument.......) Now how much of his message you believe is up to you. But as much as it's not right to spread vicious lies on Jews and their faith (Doesn't history teach us ANYTHING?) nobody has the right to insult others for their beliefs, whether they're Christians, Muslims or Wiccans. That is how some of the greatest wars started and how some of the world's most scary events took place. <br />I find it to be odd that only this movie is plagued by these trolls (While other classics involving Jesus like \\"Ben Hur\\" or \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" are left in peace) and honestly, the greatest pieces of art are either loved or hated. And honestly, great scholars of whichever religion have given Christ respect for his teachings, his message of loving thy neighbour... Even wise atheists respect Christ as a great philosopher and teacher. Sounds too romantic? Maybe. Maybe in this world filled with obnoxious arrogance and overrated self-confidence the purity of such a message seems ridiculous. Now I can see that many find it hard to believe in anything they cannot touch with their little hands. But can you hold the wind? Can you hold a scent, a soul in your hands? No? Yet it's still there and not reviled.  <br />And that is why I, even as a non-Christian, rate this movie highly. As for the accusation of Anti-Semitism: It's as ridiculous as calling the movie Schindler's list \\"anti-German\\". Plus it weren't the Jews who crucified Jesus but the Romans. It is gory, yes. It is intense and hard to watch. But beneath it lies eternal love. And to clear up another lie: The church isn't getting the money this movie made. Whoever spills such vicious crap should do his homework first. What I will do and ask every person with a brain to do is to report the violations of the guidelines around here and to ignore the fools who spread lies because of envy, poor research and hatred. Hatred always loses to rational research. And that is why this attention-craving \\"reviewer\\" doesn't \\"win\\" but he gives those who are non-Christians (like me) a bad name. I want to apologise for all this person posted, we're not all trolls like that. In short: He obviously doesn't have a life, hence he creates tons of new identities to bash a movie and a faith he cannot destroy. Too bad that his Mama obviously didn't teach him any manners.

Then go to the rock section, look under \\"P\\" for Pixies, grab this gem, pay for it, then skidaddle over to the nearest cd player (even if it ain't yours) and crank this baby up to 11!!!! (shameless Spinal Tap reference there folks!)...............or you could just buy it off of Amazon.com
B00004YKUY|5.0|At first I was not interested in hearing Journey without Steve Perry. Thank God I bought this and did not miss my chance. I love Steve Perry, but Augeri is great in his own right. (Just don't listen to him sing Perry's stuff and you'll be ok)The lyrics on Arrival are some of the best Journey has ever produced. They still rock hard. If you can get past that it is not Perry, you'll learn to love Augeri and this entire album. After all, it is still Cain, Valory, and Schon (the Master). The drummer (Deen) is one of the best, too. My favorite song, if I must pick one, is With Your Love. But they are all too good to miss. A must for every true Journey fan. Also, if you love Neal, check out SoulSirKus.com - you won't be sorry.

B00000JPH6|5.0|From the age of wonder comes a tale so bizarre, so mystical, so magical, it has to be seen to be believed! A world that once thrived is now nearly a wasteland, ruled over by cruel, half bird/half lizard creatures called the Skeksis. The planet's more humble creatures flee from their presence. Their evil is countered only by a race of good and kind wizards called the Mystics, but it is the Skeksis who maintain power over the Dark Crystal. The only hope for returning balance to their world is in that of a small gelfling boy named Jen, who, with the help of his new friends, Kira and Fizzgig, and the guidance of a wise old woman named Aughra, must reunite the Dark Crystal with its missing shard and heal an ancient species.  <br /> <br />An adventure that could only have come from the mind of Jim Henson, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is a masterpiece in every sense. Bringing to vivid life the fantastical and grotesque illustrations of Brian Froud, and clearly influenced by \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" Jim Henson and Co-Director Frank Oz  have invented a world all their own. Every creature and character that appears onscreen is a figment of the imagination, and each one is as real as you or I. The visual effects and scenery are a feast for the eyes, but the simple and engaging story is equally captivating. In the Gelflings, the filmmakers manage to capture the very embodiment of pure innocence and goodness, and in the Skeksis, the very essence of evil. The Special Edition DVD release has more than enough extras to satisfy, the most overwhelming of which is the hour long making-of documentary, \\"The World of the Dark Crystal.\\"  Other features include deleted and work-print scenes, trailers, character art profiles, talent files, and an isolated music score. Well worth the purchase for anyone looking to own the quintessential 80's fantasy film. And, while I don't think her much to look at, Kira's voice is heavenly.

0780622553|5.0|Time for something meatier!  And that something is \\"Dark City.\\" From the mind of Alex Proyas, director of \\"The Crow,\\" comes the twisted tale of a world that is anything but what it appears to be. In a city without light, everyday people go about everyday tasks, leading everyday lives, completely unaware of the puppet masters who are pulling their strings. Deep beneath the mysterious city lies an underground world of manipulation and exploitation, as alien creatures from parts unknown carefully reconstruct and rearrange the lives of their pitiful experiment subjects above, the human race. One man shines as a beam of hope for the victimized humans, but only another man can show him the way. Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch, the miracle man with the ability to \\"tune\\" the world around him the same way \\"The Strangers\\" do, and who has suddenly become aware that something about his world is just not right. As lost and out of place as the rest of his kind, marked with false memories of a life he never lived, and in danger of being given a whole new set of memories if he is captured by the agents who pursue him, John is forced to find a new escape route at every turn as he attempts to discover the truth about the Strangers and the Dark City.<br /><br />Dark City is sci-fi film noir at its best. As dark as a movie can be without becoming lost in its lack of light, Dark City paints a perfect picture of a society lost in every other possible way. Rufus Sewell is excellent in the lead role, but Kiefer Sutherland is the man that steals the show with his creepy portrayal of a \\"Peter Lorre meets Claude Rains\\" scientist walking the line between good and evil. Jennifer Connelly, back when she looked more stunning than weary, is fantastic as the sultry nightclub singer who holds the glazed look of someone unfamiliar with her own life. William Hurt is equally superb as a man thrust into the role of a classic noir detective trying to figure out what is real and what is madness, even from the mouth of his now disturbed partner, played wonderfully by Colin Friels. Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson, and a host of cronies, even some terrifying children, give nightmare inducing performances as the emotionless \\"Strangers.\\" And this wouldn't be a classic Monty Moonlight review if I didn't mention the character of May the prostitute, played by Melissa George. I would not be at all surprised if her picture was printed next to the word \\"gorgeous\\" in an illustrated dictionary somewhere; absolutely breathtaking. One cannot forget the city itself, either, which is as much a character as any human actor onscreen. The filmmakers have done a wonderful job here of blending various 20th century decades to create a world that seems very familiar, but somehow is not.<br /><br />Dark City on DVD has a nice bit of extras.

006092988X|5.0|Betty Smith penned a true classic in her novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.  It is a richly detailed and nuanced portrait of a time and place as seen through the eyes of young Francie.  This is a classic coming-of-age story that follows Francie's growth and changes and is vividly told in her own words.  It is a true pity that so many people seem to loath this wonderful book when it is assigned for school, but that is not the fault of the book.  Thank goodness I came to read this one on my own so that I could appreciate the literary treasure that is A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Well it was highly anticipated and it seems to have set the metal community alight. So welcome back to the mighty Priest indeed. And for all but the trailer song which takes the final thirteen minutes of this one its a welcome return in most areas. Having said as much perhaps \\"Lochness\\" is a grower, ooh ahh missus, you never know. A nice blend of historical Priest styles are present. Lyrically nothing too stretching, but glorious in its simple highly entertaining fashion. Although some moments are comparable to \\"Painkiller\\" luckily the band hasn't made the mistake of pitching itself at producing Painkiller II. It should be said however that in the same regard the album doesn't sound patchy as a result of blending a mix of styles. The band sounds tight and focused. Rob Halford proves why he is the Metal God and gives us ample light and shade from the banshee of \\"Judas Rising\\" to the heartfelt \\"Angel\\" through to the mesmerising new stylings of \\"Worth Fighting For\\". I can hear touches of AOR giants Magnum circa \\"Days Of No Trust\\" in this one and I like it a lot. Not sure how the pedal to the metal crowd will see it but surely balance is important in all things great. Too early to say where it sits in a hierachy of greatness, but early enough to recommend thoroughly just the same.
B0007O38F8|4.0|I didn't like this at first but it is a lot more infectious with subsequent listens.  Here's a breakdown of the songs: <br /> <br />Intro: Pointless but not bad <br /> <br />This is 50: 5/5 This song is sick!  50 throws on a southern drawl that goes well with the beat. <br /> <br />Piggy Bank: 5/5 Not a good diss track but it is a sweet song.  The hook is tight. <br /> <br />In My Hood: 5/5 More of the same thug lyrics but it is still pretty sweet. <br /> <br />I'm Supposed to Die Tonight: 4.5/5 The equivalent to Patiently Waiting or Many Men, but not as good. <br /> <br />Gatman and Robin: 3.5/5 Sounds like something D12 would do.  Not really 50's style but it is alright. <br /> <br />Candy Shop: 4/5 You already know this song. Oh and Olivia looks really hot in the video. <br /> <br />Outta Control: 5/5 Tight beat, perfect club song without totally sounding like he sold out.  It isn't as poppy as Candy Shop. <br /> <br />Get In My Car: 4/5 Kinda annoying but it'll grow on you.  It is like P.I.M.P. but not as good. <br /> <br />Ski Mask Way: 4.5/5 Good song throughout.  Sounds like something Young Buck would do if he wasn't busy stabbing people. <br /> <br />A Baltimore Love Thing: 3/5 Overrated song with pretty good lyrics.  It isn't anything special. <br /> <br />Ryder Music: 3/5 Another mediocre song. <br /> <br />Disco Inferno: 4.5/5 Good club song with ok lyrics. <br /> <br />Just a Lil Bit: 3/5 Annoying but it is still listenable.   <br /> <br />Gunz Come Out: 4/5 Same ole crap but i still like it. <br /> <br />My Toy Soldier: 10/5 Best song on the album for sure! Same subject matter but the execution is ridiculous.  50's flow is the best on this song. <br /> <br />Position of Power: 4.5/5 This is a pretty sweet song.  The beat is tight <br /> <br />Build You Up: 3/5 Meh. Another song for the ladies. <br /> <br />God Gave Me Style: 2/5 A bad song.  Footprints is a lot better than this. <br /> <br />So Amazing: 4/5 So 50 officially sold out! I don't like R & Bbut this isn't the worst thing in the world.  I feel bad for saying i like it. <br /> <br />I Don't Need 'Em: 3/5 Filler that should have been left out. <br /> <br />Hate It Or Love It: 4/5 I like the version Game did better but it is sweet that everyone from G-Unit is on it. <br /> <br />Overall it is good.  The stand outs are the first few songs, Outta Control, and My Toy Soldier.  I expected better 50 and am dissapointed with you.
0440237688|5.0|In a world of social deprevation and singularity, one without individuality and self discovery, there is one that is different... One that sees that which others take for granted, and that which others cannot... <br /> <br />Jonas leads a regular life, and has no idea what the future will hold for him at the Ceremony of Twelve that draws near.

My thoughts often time would be reflections of what I would day dream off as based from the reading I had to do.  <br /> <br />This book represents the ideas that several socities have thought of to some degree, and represents a form of socialism in a way.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Please don't buy this CD for your kids.  I am a proud, active mother of twin daughters (11 y/o).  Today I spent a few hours explaining why they shouldn't dance or dress like Britney.  This was precipitated by my watching my daughters plan to make \\"britney\\" costumes and dance like \\"I'm a slave\\" for the neighborhood kids.  From now on, I'll be sure to avoid talentless, media-contrived, divas that stay in the headlines for wearings nearly nothing and contributing less.
B000005RFQ|5.0|\\"Born Again\\" is the only album put out by this line-up of Black Sabbath (Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward and Ian Gillan of Deep Purple Fame).  In my opinion it was an extremely hard hitting line-up that I would rank right up there with the Dio era, as there can obviously be no substitute for the original line-up. Gillans vocal range and high pitched screems and demonic laughs really brought the songs on \\"Born Again\\" to life.  He also very capably covered the songs of his two predecessors in live shows. <br /> <br />\\"Born Again\\" hits hard right from the opening gun with \\"Trashed\\" , then leaves you mesmerized with the cuts \\"StoneHenge\\" and \\"Disturbing the Priest\\".  The anthem \\"Zero the Hero\\" is the fourth knockout on the album, and the title track \\"Born Again\\" should have gone down as a signature Sabbath tune in the same vein as \\"Iron Man\\" or \\"War Pigs\\". <br /> <br />It is too bad that this is the only effort by this version of the band!..I HIGHLY recommend it! <br /> <br /> <br />Gary Burke

B000002IST|3.0|Firstly, <br /> <br />1) I divide old Genesis and newer Genesis into different bands. The sounds are completely different and I don't even try and compare the two. I don't even think I'm in the same mood when I listen to a We Can't Dance or versus a Foxtrot. Two different experiences. Similarly, I don't listen to YES' 'Owner of a Lonely Heart' or 'Love Will Find A Way' when I'm in a 'Southside of the Sky' mood. <br /> <br />2) PHIL COLLINS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO 'BLAME' for the change in the sounds. It is quite obvious that Tony Banks was a prickly pear and certainly wouldn't do anything he didn't want to. Or, anyone ever hear any Mike and the Mechanics stuff? Hardly a 'Get'em Out By Friday' in the bunch. Even Tony Banks solo stuff (the stuff he wanted to sell anyway) is hardly prog faithful. So if you hate the later Genesis, they're all to blame equally. <br /> <br />Now, <br /> <br />This album isn't the best album in the world, but I still like it. It came out just as I was getting out of college and starting 'real life'. I have a lot of memories listening to this disk and seeing the tour behind it. 'We Can't Dance' is alright, but I was never a fan of 'Jesus He Knows Me' (pretty tired idea by this time - but for the Peter Gabriel suckups - is this any different than something like 'Barry Williams' Show'? And Sledgehammer and Steam aren't sell out tunes?). <br /> <br />'Dreaming While You Sleep' overstays its welcome, and 'Driving The Last Spike' does too, but 'Fading Lights' entertains me throughout. I liked 'Living Forever' though 'Tell Me Why' is yet another 'meaningful' song (I assume from Phil).  <br /> <br />Overall an average album. I even concede they were running out of steam by this time during their Pop era. I liked Invisible Touch a little more, though the two major singles were horrible. The rest was good. This was just a little less overall.  <br /> <br />Three stars out of Five. They still are very good musicians, writing, arranging, and playing their own stuff. It may be Pop, but it's still light years ahead N'98 New Spears on the Blech! And I'd rather listen to this than Gabriel's 'UP' - world music is fine, but did it have to be 13 funeral dirges from around the world? It's not like Gabriel has been cranking out 'Watcher of the Skies' or even an 'I Have the Touch'.
B000002H33|5.0|This, along with \\"Ride the Ligthning\\" and \\"And Justice for All\\", is one of Metallica's essential albums. There is a general concensus that this is Metallica's finest album although I personally prefer \\"Ride the Lighning\\" and feel that \\"And Justice For All\\" is more ambitious if flawed.  <br />Regardless, an essential addition to any metalhead's collection. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|A must buy album. i\'ve only had it for a week and i believe that great albums need to stand the test of time. if it\'s as great as there last album, which has lasted, then another great by TMV! the more you listen the more you like!
B00006SFBD|5.0|People don't seem to like this album very much.  I'm not sure why.  In my opinion it is better than \\"Blackwater Park\\", and that is really saying something.  In fact, it is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Yes, it's right up there with \\"Master of Puppets\\" and the likes. <br /> <br />The opening track is extremely heavy, interesting and relentless, with a few tribal drums.  It is quite something.  Following that is the title track, which is really incredible and rhythmically mesmerizing.  \\"A Fair Judgement\\" is definately my favorite; it is heavy and sad and chilling.  (I think Opeth could cut out the grunting and make more tunes like this without losing any intensity.  Imagine a crossbreed album of \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Damnation\\".)   \\"A Fair Judgement\\" would certainly make for an excellent suicide song.  \\"For Absent Friends\\" is a little jazz/classical-type hybrid that only the likes of Opeth could pull off.  \\"Master's Apprentices\\" is heavy and creepy, a fine combination.  The final track is awesome, especially the circus/waltz section in the middle. <br /> <br />The musical theme of this album seems to me to be off-kelter syncopation.  Many of the songs also deal in unusual 6/8 territory.  This gives the music a frantic, driving feeling that was lacking on \\"Blackwater Park\\". <br /> <br />Finally, the new imagery introduced on the album cover of the old house and dolls is a very original and effective departure from the standard forest scenery on most albums of this genre.   <br /> <br />This is truly brilliant material, folks.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I believe that Titanic truly is a theatrical masterpiece. The intesnse love affair of Jack ( the very nice Leo Di caprio) and Rose ( Kate winslet) is amazingly acted, and really touched me. the ending, and the entire film for that matter, literally has me in tears every time, and it takes a lot for a film to affect me like that. The plot is very well thought out, although you can kind of tell its going to hit an iceberg what with all the warnings, but nothing can ruin this film, its truly amazing. (note cameo by Ioan Grufydd!) Titanic is the best flm ever made, and always will be.
0671799320|5.0|Since I first laid my hands on this book a few years ago I have found myself going back to it over and over again. It is extremely well researched, packed with an incredible amount of information (the notes and bibliography sections are among the most ridiculous I have ever seen), touching subjects as varied as the two world wars, the shaping of the Middle East and the impact of the automobile on American society. At the same time it is easy to read and a wealth of great anecdotes make it more entertaining than a lot of novels. It covers almost 150 years of world history from the specific angle of the oil industry. Rather than being one-sided it adds an additional perspective to periods and events that is hard to find in such a refined form elsewhere.<br /><br />This is certainly one of the best books I have read in the past years. The only downside is that the narrative ends around 1990. I would buy an updated new edition immediately.
0743454537|5.0|This book was very much about several kinds of relationships.<br /><br />It gives much food for thought about medical and family issues.  I found the family dynamics, their emotions, decisions and actions, the knowledge required by professionals, ethics (medical and otherwise), the legal considerations and learning about modern medical techniques all go together to make interesting reading.  It gives you the point of view of the \\"child\\" who is caught up in foregoing much of her own life experiences to give her sister a chance.  They are both caught in a complicated and emotional trap.<br /><br />It helps you to see the impact of this situation on all the different members of a family in crisis, and the lengths they'll go to to keep the family intact.<br /><br />After the end of the book, there is a section that has a \\"conversation with Jodi Piccoult\\", and then another section with \\"questions and topics for discussion\\" about plot points in the book.  These parts really added to the book and helps you rehash points in the book for better understanding.<br /><br />It's a good read.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|While De-loused in the Comatorium was an awesome prog-rock album, Frances the Mute is a little to prog for my tastes. It still has some great parts but there are more portions that I would rather fast forward through (I've had enough of distorted spoken word).<br /><br />The track list on Amazon is incorrect. Here's the track list for my CD:<br /><br />1. Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus<br /><br />2. The Widow<br /><br />3. L'Via l'Viaquez<br /><br />4. Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore<br /><br />5-11. Cassandra Gemini<br /><br />I'm not sure why the last song needs seven tracks, but it does.
0756603749|4.0|A great book, with great color illustrations, some information about rope, and which knots are good for which activities or goals.  The book starts off too complicated for me.  I think they need to publish a \\"Knots for Idiots\\" book...that would be more my pace.  If you're completely new to knots, like me, give up now.
0375507256|5.0|I think \\"audacious\\" is the best way to describe Clous Atlas.  David Mitchell is showing off a bit here, but I did not mind a bit because both the overall theme of the book and the individual stories within were so interesting and involving.  There are six stories, told in ascending order:  story 1 part 1, story 2 part 1, and so on, with the sixth story told in its entirety as the centerpiece of the book, and then finishing in reverse order, story 5 part 2, story 4 part 2, etc., ending with story 1 part 2.  This may sound needlessly flashy and complex, but it works.  Seriously works.   <br /> <br />My reading experience was a bit like a cascade, which may have been Mitchell's intent.  I was moderately interested in the first story, more so the second, even more so the third, loved the fourth, was fascinated by the fifth, and read the sixth in one sitting late one night, kept up by the suspense.  I then plowed through the remaining stories, and literally could not wait to pick up the end of the first story (in which I was only moderately interested when first starting the book).  The stories are connected in ways which at first seem subtle, but then grow more powerful as the book progresses.  One of my few nitpicks is that, in this regard, the author tried to weave in a physical connection between the six protagonists, which not only felt contrived, but also needless in light of the larger, stronger, and much more satisfying thematic connections.  However, this is, as noted, merely a nitpick.  <br /> <br />The stories concern an American notary asea in the early 1800s near the Chatham Islands, a bisexual English composer in 1930s Belguim, an investigative reporter in 1970s Los Angeles, a modern-day English pulp publisher, a foodservice clone in a not-too-distant future consumer-dominated Korea, and a post-apocalyptic New-Iron-Age storyteller in the Hawaiian Islands.  While, as I mentioned, the individual stories are compelling, it is the overarching themes which so clealry recommend the book:  the interaction between dominant and marginalized members of societies, and the way in which humans help and harm one another in their quest for \\"progress,\\" however that may be defined.  This theme may sound far-fetched when put in relief against my brief description of the stories, but it makes so much sense -- and it so compelling -- when read as written by Mitchell. <br /> <br />And here we come to the most wonderful part of Cloud Atlas:  the writing.  Mitchell is a wizard.  Each of the stories is written in a different form and different voice, and, much like the odd pacing of the book, works surprisingly well to serve the overall theme.  The way in which Mitchell inhabits the skin of each protagonist is truly remarkable.  This is not hyperbole.  It is really is quite impressive. <br /> <br />In sum, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is terrific.  It is brilliantly written, entertaining, and deals with interesting and important themes.  Bravo!
0679731369|5.0|Well, I personally hate one someone mentions post-modern. Mentioning of it most often means that person lacks words to describe something, or that that something differs from usual. Even the post-modern authors, who proclaimed themselves as being post-modern, didn't yet came up with plausible solution to the question of boundaries even of modern, not even to speak of something that comes after.<br /><br />So, I shall say it now and hopefully evade your wrath.<br /><br />This book stands up for postmodern. Oh yeah. Here we go.<br /><br />Barnes was shortlisted for Man Booker prize twice. Once with this book, and other time with \\"England, England\\". Instead of Booker her received two noted French prizes. So don't you mean now that I value the books by the prizes it gets. I'm not that shallow.<br /><br />Opening few chapters of the books doesen' give us a clue about anything. We find ourselves emerged in a biography og Gustav Flaubert, and curious little incident of existance of two parrots that are supposedly models that Flaubert used when writing one of his stories. Second chapter deals with cronography of Flaubert's life. And than, just when you thought that this will be some kind of hommage to great realist writer you understand that narrator is not Julian Barns but Geofrrey Braithwaite, who is a doctor, and who is amateur in things literraire concerning Flaubert and highly interested in beforementioned parrots. Surprise, surprise.<br /><br />What follows is typical post-modernistic build up of narration, with often variying of narrators, giving voice to personas in documents and books, intertextual comments, humoristic lines worty of Kishon, conversation of narrator with the reader himself, flow of time that has neither begining nor end pas and present coexist in the same period, intelectuallity meets simple facts of life and so on...list continues...<br /><br />Yet, in all that mixture reader never feels lost. If you lack education you may miss certain profane references and you may lose some way of interpretation, but Barnes puted upfront an appealing story of search for knowledge, search for progress which can be read without all of academic mumbo-jumbo (which is the reason why this book is so higlgy praise by the critics...)<br /><br />Worty of a second readin...and a third one....ences and you may lose some way of interpretation, but Barnes puted upfront an appealing story of search for knowledge, search for progress which can be read without all of academic mumbo-jumbo (which is the reason why this book is so higlgy praise by the critics...) <br />Worty of a second readin...and a third one....
0671027387|3.0|Even though it does get a little silly how the heroine manages to get rescued out of completely impossible situations over and over again, I found myself perfectly entertained. The story has some good turns that are not that obvious and kept my attention pretty much to the very end. This is a thriller not literature and I felt I got what I paid for.<br /><br />This is more of a tech-thriller than both 'The Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons', so as long as you don't expect the same type of mystic secrets this should be an enjoyable read.
044024157X|4.0|And it really merits more like 4.5 stars. Skipping the summary (which you probably read above) let's get to the meat. Those readers who met John Grisham and fell in love with his novels starting with The Firm will be pleased to see the man get back into legal thrills. Unfortunately, they will possibly be disappointed that the legal thriller aspects are few and far between. As many Grisham readers know, he has recently taken to writing more sentimental, personal, poignant novels (A Painted House and Bleachers), and with this novel he does the same. He has fairly successfully married the two approaches and styles with this novel. Unfortunately, the lovingly painted southern town life is too loving and long. Grisham needed to restrain himself and 'revise down' as my writing coach often said. About fifty to 100 less pages would have been far more appropriate to the actual story told.  <br />Some might disagree and say that our modern media audience is too distractable, but the fact is that the actual story that Grisham tells is pretty simple and small.  <br />Less words and faster pace would have polished this novel to a five star shine.
0385510454|2.0|Not Grisham's finest work.  The book starts off with promise then turns into a combination Italian language lesson and travelogue.  After several hundred pages, Grisham remembers that this was supposed to be a thriller of some sort and tells that part of the story, leaving one of the main bad guys out in limbo somewhere.  Hope he'll do better the next time, but in hindsight, this is one that he could have skipped.
B000002KAT|5.0|This album is absolutely phenomenal.  This is one of the most personal, beautiful artistic statements I can think of.  It is like a diary, but better, because the music adds color and depth that no words can describe.  It is rare when the music compliments the singer so well... it is as if the musicians are from the same vein, the same heart.  This cd is perfect, beginning to end; musically and lyrically.  Van Morrison will show you his lowest low and ever so sweetly, he will take you away to a place that is timeless, a place so wonderful it will make you want to weep... because you know that at some point it will have to end.  And what a sad ending it is to this miraculous cd. But you can always press repeat.  :)
B000002HD5|5.0|Nobody sang about the dirty side of love like the Whigs. This is their masterpiece, a truly perfect record from first lovelorn, alcohol-soaked note to the very last.  <br /> <br />The Whigs are no more but their songs still give me chills.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|I would like to start by saying that I am a great fan of the movie Donnie Darko. That being said, I may be guilty of some bias. <br /> <br />As I said in the title, this is truly a brilliant film. Its depth and originality provide something so rare in modern cinema that simply watching this movie makes one feel like one has tripped through the mud of popular movies and inadvertently kicked up a small piece of gold. There are countless \\"Teen Angst\\" movies, but few actually show the depth of the open-ended questions we all discover in our youth. The main character, aptly named Donnie Darko, faces not only these universal dilemmas but also his own schizophrenia. Donnie finds himself pondering one of mankind's oldest questions: What is the point of living if everyone dies alone? The storytelling never falls flat and the actors never try to over-act as seen in so many Academy Award-winning \\"masterpieces\\". The brilliance of this film could never be properly conveyed in words alone. <br /> <br />That being said, This poster has a serious complaint about this new cut. If it was possible for a new \\"director's cut\\" to surpass George Lucas's re-release of the original Star Wars Trilogy in its ability to leave a sour taste in one's mouth, it is this movie. This cut provides no new scenes that were not available as extras on the 2001 DVD release. What it does include is pointless \\"scifi-esque\\" effects such as a close-up of a human eyeball twitching. There is honestly no reason for this nonsense to be edited into such an excellent movie. Another bit of added information comes in the form of book pages being superimposed over a few scenes. This is also superfluous as the entire book from which these pages are taken was included in the extras of the 2001 release.  <br /> <br />The movie itself deserves five stars, but this new DVD is a worse edit than the new Star Wars DVDs. Please, buy the original 2001 DVD release; you will have a much better experience.
0679879269|5.0|Winner of the Whitebread Award this book is just astounding. It is the final book to the beautiful His Dark Materials trilogy. The ending has some loose ends which shouldnt be viewed as a bad thing but rather wonderful because it allows you to imagine what occurs in those silent moments, ex.Lyra and Will in the forest and the settling of their daemons. <br /> <br />A GREAT READ!
B00007ELF2|1.0|This a really bad rip off of the BBC mini series.  Don't waste your money on this. Buy the BBC series instead and see some good acting and a plot that sticks together.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I have never been a prog rock fan at all.   I mean, a little Pink Floyd and Rush is all I can take at a time, so why is this stuff holding me in sway?  It is so different that is utterly enjoyable I guess.  I generally like basic song structures and this is obviously not that for sure.  Maybe it is the musicmanship, or maybe the vocals, or maybe it is the constant quantum leaps this music takes, but it definitely has a hold on me.  Too bad the tour is not coming closer to me than it is.   Add more dates!!!
B00005M91K|5.0|This is your world.  How can you not respect a movie that takes you from your daily life of limited perspective and mundane daily activity and flings you across the world to see breathtaking shots of the world you live in? The good, the bad, and the indifferent.  Everytime I watch this I am humbled, I am shrunk to my proper size, my concerns, my fears, my complaints are all drowned out and I am left thinking, \\"why do I stress about little things in my life?\\"  There are bigger concerns in the world than my petty problems and their is beauty out there that surpasses ordinary eye candy.  There is a big bright beautiful, sad, living, breathing organism called planet earth that is spinning in space.  This is priceless, to me.  But this kind of movie is not for everybody.  Rent it first, if you find it humbles you in a meditative way, than you might see it like I do - as a priceless experience - and you will buy the darn thing, just as I have.    My only complaint is that this movie doesn't show all sides, all aspects... but it can't, nor does it attempt to.  It is just that the images become just a tad bit one sided.  Hard to explain, but it is no biggie.  This is a five star \\"movie\\".
B00000I9MK|5.0|I had never heard of twee or Belle and Sebastian until a month ago. My friend explained that twee was about subverting norms. What looks weak and sweet is actually a real affront to the cooler than thou hipsters. I can't agree more! <br /> <br />Right behind the surface here you'll find music with much depth and power. These folks know how to play and write music. They don't rely on persona to get their message to us.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The theatrical trailers I had seen didn't prepare me for this movie. (Should have read the Amazon reviews first! LOL!)  <br /> <br />The Butterfly Effect is a darkly complex, violent, and graphic psychological thriller. Despite the violence, it is strangely compelling. Ashton Kutcher does a fine job, playing the main character Evan, and carrying the movie with surprising skill. (He was an executive producer on the project.)  <br /> <br />Evan suffered from blackouts as a young boy, typically during times of great violence and/or tragedy. As a college student, he develops the ability not only to remember what happened during those blackouts, but to be present during that time line and alter what has happened. He attempts to change the past and resulting future in order to rescue his childhood friend Kaylie from what fate has dealt her. But each time he changes the past, as might be expected, the future changes in unexpected ways. Evan then becomes caught in a roller-coaster ride of present versus past as he attempts to repair and alter an unrelenting cascade of tragic events. <br /> <br />The movie is graphic and violent. If you have triggers for abuse or violence or PTSD, you should avoid this movie, since it pretty much hit every trigger you can think of. In fact, even if you have no triggers, you may find much of the stuff uncomfortable to watch, as I did. Still, if that isn't an issue for you, or you can get past that, it is quite the psychological thriller. It truly isn't everyone's cup of tea, so I can't really recommend it. But if you are up for a psychological thriller with seriously dark, graphic, intense and violent elements, it's quite the ride.  <br /> <br />(Note: I have only seen the theatrical version, not the deleted scenes or alternate Director's cut ending.)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I second all the good things said about this movie. The modern music and the classic dance numbers make you want to just break out and celebrate life, real living and love. Ewan and Nicole are also really good together and much better singers than I had thought they would be.
0393324818|5.0|After reading this book it is evident that Beane et al. have incorporated statistics and technology into baseball.  Having a background in math and computers (and a huge baseball fan), this is of great interest to me.  It is always nice to see the intellectuals unventing and incorporating a new paradigm to essentially 'break' the game.  It actually amazes me that Beane allowed this to be published.  He reveals a bit of his 'tech'.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough, read it ASAP!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This is a comedic masterpiece.  Stanley Kubrick is a genius and this movie is absolutely hilarious, with knock out performances by George C Scott and Peter Sellers.  This is what great cinematic experiences are all about and it proves that you don't need a big budget to make a perfect, mind blowing film.  In fact, the lack of a good budget I think works in the movie's favor, allowing it to remain timeless and completely hysterical, adding to the madness and ludicrous behavior of the whole thing.  It is amazing when a movie can take place in only three rooms and be so complete and lacking absolutely nothing. <br /> <br />I am no film major, not an expert either, but I think it is obvious that this film should be studied and critiqued in film schools across this nation.  It is absolutely brilliant.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Incredible Soundtrack. Some may not have liked the movie. But you just have to love the soundtrack. Although some slow songs may appear to be a little to &quot;sappy&quot; when listened to outside the context of the movie, most songs can be played anywhere anytime, and make a great dance record!
B000274THQ|5.0|as a kid growing up in a socialist country we were taught that this was the ideal way of life, that this is how it is suposed to be. we were taught that the west was something to be mistrusted, but we all secretly wanted to be part of it. when i saw the east german cartoons, my eyes flooded with tears. they were simple, shabily done and had one message, the propoganda of socialism/commnism. what a stark difference it was when i saw disney cartoons, the technology was so much more complex, the plot was more comlex, so much far ahead than the cartoon celebrating Gagarin. to those who havent had the chance to live in a \\"COMMIE\\" country thinks it was all about oppression, but somehow in all that imposed suffering there seemed to be a feeling of security, of calm. when the berlin wall came down, and soon after the entire eastern bloc people were (are in some areas) forced to deal with the confusion, with the final realization that the west has finally come. i think that this movie illustrates this point very well. even though the satelite tv has come in and western food has now invaded the formerly barren shelves of markets there still lies and underlying feeling of regret of having let the feeling of peace go.
B00005221M|2.0|Unfortunately, I didn't buy this DVD at Amazon and without reading the reviews didn't realize until it was too late that the director had done such a disservice to this terrific film. The VHS release was true to what we saw in the theater; the director's expanded edition isn't. Gone is the haunting Clannad song along with one of the film's better lines (Nathaniel to Duncan: \\"One of these days you and I are going to have a serious disagreement.\\"). The song was probably lost to some legal dispute, but why toss the line? When you've seen a film several times and are used to hearing a line, it's disconcerting when it's not there--a lot like watching familiar films that have been edited to run on television. Worse, the film now has an expanded ending, meaning that the once powerful close is obscurred by additional dialogue that adds nothing to the story. This is the first time I've regretted \\"upgrading\\" from VHS to DVD. Apparently the DVD format has encouraged film directors to indulge their egos and put in what wise film editors took out (or take out what was better left in). My advice is to skip this, buy the VHS, or wait and hope that studio execs will eventually show the good sense to release a widescreen DVD of the theatrical version.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|(My review scale: 1- Bad, 2- Average, 3- Good, 4- Very Good, 5- Excellent/Classic) <br /> <br />The mighty Priest is back, with the Metal God, Rob Halford behind the mic, once again.  Angel of Retribution, the first cd with the classic Priest lineup since the early 90's, is a good album, with many nods to their past, but not anything close to their classic albums of the past. <br /> <br />Fans of the Painkiller album will be very happy with AOR, since it's the album Priest revisits most often on this offering.  Right off the bat, \\"Judas Rising\\", after a slight buildup, busts into a pounding effort, much like the Painkiller era.  Following is \\"Deal with the Devil\\", a nice speedy effort, that sounds like something from Defenders of the Faith or a tune off the Halford debut.   <br /> <br />\\"Revolution\\" is definately British Steel-era, and is again, pretty good.  \\"Worth Fighting For\\", is a damn nice tune, and reminds me of the Point Of Entry era, with a slight bit (and thankfully the only bit) of Turbo/Ram It Down sound.  Another strong tune in \\"Demonizer\\", which is more Painkiller sound.  Wheels of Fire is a decent number, and reminds me of the Screaming For Vengeance/Defenders of the Faith style sound.   <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\" is very old school Priest!  What a song!  This is Sad Wings of Destiny meets Sin After Sin meets Stained Class-era, rolled into one.  \\"Hellrider\\" is fairly generic metal.  Not much new here, and again, very Painkiller-like.  \\"Eulogy\\" is an okay tune, which features some nice vocals from Halford.  It's slow and brooding, but works.  \\"Lochness\\" is the final tune on the album and is really the reason I didn't give this 4 stars rather than 3.  It is, in a sense, very old school and takes Priest fans back to the Rocka Rolla days, with the long song which changes tempos and speeds, but it really does little for me.  It will no doubt be a favorite live in concert in Europe, where the sing-along, soccer song chorus, will delight fans.  It's kind of like United, only longer and not as good.  The song starts off sounding like old Black Sabbath and then delves into an Iron Maiden-like meander, before returning to Priest sound. <br /> <br />The album is good.  Not great but good.  It gives the fan a good return to just about every era of Priest music, with the exception of the Turbo/Ram It Down albums.  The bonus DVD is a nice extra.  It's nice to see the boys back together and hopefully they can continue to rock for a while.
B00000634J|4.0|It says a whole bunch just to make the statement that this is the best collection of Lennon songs.  However, that being said, I would like to suggest that an even better album would include \\"How\\" and \\"God\\", and even the \\"real love\\" demo - all of which can be heard on the Imagine soundtrack.  I bought both cds and mixed those three gems onto this collection and I am completely satisfied.  That is my Lennon fix.  Thought I would share.    *What would music, in general, sound like today if John Lennon had not been murdered?  I ask myself that question a lot.  A true legend, there are few musicians worthy of that title.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|Last night I watched my tape of Zep from that day, and despite what everybody seems to think, Zep was awesome! Sure they were rusty, but flashes of their power shown through. Plant's voice was kicking in. Jimmy Page was struggling, but watching him do so was intense. Cig hanging out, he was working hard, and what more could you ask for? Their engine was warming up, and then, they were gone. 3 songs and poof. The maker of this DVD should have tried harder to get the Zep set on it. It is by far the most dramatic Philly moment. And it is history. Keeping it off was a mistake.As a previous reviewer alluded to, 85 songs are missing, and I would've loved to have seen and heard them all. Oh well, get the DVD anyway for all the songs you didn't see or tape that day, and the proceeds go to a good cause.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film tells the story of four main characters, each of which becomes addicted to drugs and suffers the consequences.     The main character,his girlfriend and friend are addicted to illlicit narcotics, in the fictitious universe in which this film is set these become harder to come by as the film goes on, their search for a new 'score' leads each of the three into their own personal hell, the hells are physical, spiritual and sexual respectively. However terrible their fates are, the sympathy evinced at their plights pales compared to that evoked by the suffering of the fourth victim - the main characters' mother who unlike them is perhaps completely innocent and blameless for her addiction to legal medicines over-prescribed to her by her unscrupulous doctor. Her hell is mental.    Extremely harsh, pessimistic and fatalistic throughout, the film takes the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster as we watch inevitably as their lives are torn to pieces. The world minus the four characters is extremely callous and unmerciful, from the opportunistic 'John' who trades the girl drugs for sexual humiliation to the hospital medic who deliberately misleads the mentally obliterated woman into signing a form allowing them to pulverise her brain with (perhaps) unnecessary shock treatment to the redneck doctor (the film is very harsh towards the medical profession) who instead of treating the main character Harry for gangrene has him jailed instead. The acting is superb (particularly the old lady and the young woman) throughout and the soundtrack is excellent, chirpy jarring violins evoke sentiments of melancholy and an impending crescendo of doom. The director uses some innovative methods, the quick flashing images of pupils dilating and chemicals being sucked down a syringe and the slow motion effects used to portray the feeling of being drugged are very effective particularly.    This film is also perfectly titled (ok credit to the author not the film), a requiem is a prayerfor the dead/a dream is hope for a new beginning, the film leaves us in absolutely no doubt which of the two is most appropriate here. I  admired the careful interlocution between sickly melancholic fantasy and terrible crushing reality in the lives of the four characters. You may feel for these characters long after you have left the cinema, sadly i recognise one of them.
B000002AH9|3.0|Lady in Satin is a nice  album, and certainly if you are full scale Billie Holiday fan, it is an album you will have and enjoy and play. No one who really looks at Billie's work as that of a Jazz artist developing and continuing a work begun in her youth can go along with all the hype that says this is one of her best albums, because it isn't.<br /><br />  She may have said it was her favorite album during the last year of her life to sell it just as she said \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" told the story of her life when it absolutely did not. Both were earning her money, but neither assertion is true. But people who will believe this kind of hype probably believe the title Lady Sings the Blues indicates Billie was a Blues singer. They talk about her knowledge of \\"the blues\\" when as much as Billie admired the big tone of Bessie Smith, Billie never liked to be called a blues singer. She was a jazz singer.  She only recorded a few blues, and then only because there was session time to fill.  She was, in fact, forced out of her position in the Basie band, in part because of her lack of a blues repertoire.  She was replaced by Helen Humes.  Humes had been recording blues for years before Billie recorded anything and continued on as an jump and R & B singer cutting blues for a couple decades after she left Basie.<br /><br />  The accollades for the album are more of a way of continuing the sad approach of looking at Billie not as an artist whose work reflects her own development and that of the broader culture, but of looking at her as a personal crisis for examination and pity. Some speak of her voice having \\"matured\\" here, but the truth is a life of abusing her voice by heroin addiction, cigarrette smoking, and near alcholism had destroyed a once strong and beautiful voice, a voice that top jazz instrumentalists saw on a par with their own saxes, trumpets, pianos, or trombnes in creating beautiful jazz riffs and lines. There is nothing on this album that can compare with the vibrancy and musical creation on her 1930s Columbia sides, which is what you should get if you are interested in her best work and not hyping her tragedy!<br /><br />  The album reflected the drift away from recording her as a Jazz artist that happened at the end of her life.  This wasn't just a function of developments in Billie's life and singing, but reflected the commercial record industry's attempt to take a number of jazz artists in a pop direct as jazz and every other kind of record sales plummeted once rock and roll began to dominate the charts.  So many of these songs and arrangements are better suited for a singer like Julie Christie, than for the jazz Billie Holiday.<br /><br />The attempt here is to put her over as a chanteuse of torch songs, of emotional songs which can be hyped to represent her personal crsis. The attempt is also to take her out of Jazz and to market her to the pop market. The use of Ellis who is more suited to back an artist like Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin than a Jazz artist like Holiday, indeed the use of the big 1950s studio orchestra with strings, is really part of a pop approach.<br /><br />  Despite the decline in her voice and her health, Holiday always retained her feel for Jazz rhythm and swing.<br /><br />  Even in her youth, it was never the power or strength of her voice, but her total swing sensibility that was as good as that of the top swing musicians like Lester Young, Bennie Goodman, Ben Webster, Freddie Green, Buck Clayton, Johnnie Hodges, Teddy Wilson, and the rest of the long line of musicians who flocked to be on her Columbia recordings because of what she offered as a jazz creator.<br /><br />  Almost none of that is here on this recording.  The problem is not really so much Billie's health or addiction, although I am sure that didn't help anything, but the effort to take her pop and to market her personal problems by making her a tragic singer of tragic songs.  No doubt, this has also made the album popular withpeople who don't appreciate or like Jazz, but are part of the pop mainstream.<br /><br />  Lady in Satin has an eiree and dark side to it. There is sometimes a brutal contrast between Billie's attempt to use the nuances of swing jazz against the stiff pop with strings arrangements. Her voice may not be great, and the legend is that this album was a great struggle to create, but her feel for the rhythm and meaning is never weak, never average, always superb.<br /><br />  This is still an album I own and have owned first on vinyl, then on tape, and now on CD.  It is one I do listen to, but maybe just once a year, whereas I need some of the real Billie every day.  If you are just starting out to try to learn Billie, try any of the great Columbia recordings from the 1930s, or her Verve tracks from the late 1940s and 1950s to hear some of the real Billie Holiday the jazz singer.or like Jazz, but are part of the pop mainstream.

B000002UAU|5.0|I hesitated about doing a review about Sgt Pepper simply because there is plenty of reviews already and what would one more really add to the previously numerous comments, both good and bad, that have been said.  However, since I had written a review of the Beach Boys Pet Sounds before I thought I should add my two cents worth to Sgt Pepper as well.  Putting aside all the debates about the Beach Boys/Beatles controversy of who influenced whom, I have never liked the music of the Beach Boys...period!  To me there is no comparing Sgt Pepper to the sappy monotony of Pet Sounds.  To me the Beatles are and were the greatest rock band to have ever been and that's that!  So Sgt Pepper, in my book, is in the running for the best recording of all time!  Sgt Pepper's production is brilliant, the recording techniques are revolutionary (even by today's standards), the compositions are timeless (my favorites have always been \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\", \\"Within You, Without You\\" and \\"Day In The Life\\"), and above all Sgt Pepper changed the style and the way music was composed and made.  If you do not own this ground-breaking recording, then your music collection will never be complete.  Sgt Pepper will always be for me one of the most phenomenal pieces of music ever recorded.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.

0156027321|5.0|Or should I even call it a story?  Life of Pi is part survival novel,part spiritual manifesto.  It's so stimulating, and read on so many different levels.  My family listened to it in the car, and as a result we all became acquainted with the story.  My ten-year-old brother loved Richard Parker and Pi's odd, respectful relationship and the toils of being stuck out at sea.  My mother and I appreciated that, but also Pi's spiritual journey, and his coming of age.  Just imagine the doors that open- coming of age on a lifeboat!  Wth a starving tiger! <br />The symbolism kept the two of us talking for hours- like the vivid color imagery and the importance of all the different religions and animals.   <br />Overal, this book is a must read.  It's my mother's favorite book of all time.  Mine is 1984, but Life of Pi is definitely up there!
B00008PRR9|5.0|In 1995, the Who's 1st LP for the Reaction label, A Quick One, from 1966, was remastered, remixed in analogue and re-issued in the UK by Polydor (527 758-2), complete with 10 extra tracks and a colour booklet with extensive notes.<br /><br />A Quick One, featuring a cover by the very fashionable Pop Art graphic artist Alan Aldridge, showed that the Who had developed a unique sound and style of their own. Gone was the profusion of cover versions as found on My Generation, their first album, with all members of the band contributing to the composer credits. Only one cover, Martha and the Vandellas' Heatwave, in an arrangement from an Everly Brothers album, made the final tracklisting (an earlier version had been dropped from the My Generation album, and in America even this new version was replaced by the hit single Happy Jack).<br /><br />A Quick One lacked the wild savagery soundwise of the first album, but still had all the elements of it including Keith Moon's powerhouse drumming and chaotic creative energy, as showcased on the well-named instrumental Cobwebs And Strange. The songs were in the main light-hearted and enjoyably immature, John Entwistle's Boris The Spider and Whiskey Man in particular showed a unique humour. Pete Townshend's songwriting talents continued to develop. The album opened with his thunderous Run, Run Run, a song that had earlier been given to The Cat to record on a single produced by Pete Townshend. Along the way came So Sad About Us, later to be covered by the Breeders and the Jam (who also revived the Who's version of Heatwave). The album finale was the ten-minute mini-opera A Quick One (While He's Away), which set in motion a whole new direction for his talents, and led, of course, to Tommy.<br /><br />The extra tracks began with most of the contemporaneous Ready Steady Who! EP: Batman, Bucket T and Barbara Ann, the three surf music covers from side 1, and Disguises from side 2 (Peculiarly, Circles is not included on this or, it seems, any other Who CD except in an earlier recording). The surfer sides were the influence of Keith Moon, who had played in a surf combo called the Beachcombers in the surfing paradise of Wembley, London.<br /><br />The B-sides of Happy Jack (I've Been Away), Pictures Of Lily (Doctor, Doctor) and I'm A Boy (In The City) follow, all written or co-written by John Entwistle, and three previously unreleased tracks complete the package. These are an acoustic version of Happy Jack, a great cover of the Everly Brothers' Man With Money and an anarchic version of My Generation which appears to begin in mono and segues gloriously into a stereo feedback-drenched rendition of Land Of Hope And Glory. This was originally intended for the Ready Steady Who! EP, released to tie-in with their appearance on the famous TV show, but was not music from the show itself.<br /><br />A Quick One was originally released in mono in the UK, and according to the booklet in both mono and stereo versions in the US, although the 1995 re-issue CD appears not to have had access to the stereo masters if such they were (they may just have been electronically re-channeled fake stereo). Run, Run, Run appeared in a stereo version previously available on the vinyl Backtrack 3 compilation sampler, but, apart from Whiskey Man the rest of the original album was monaural, with 5 of the bonus tracks in stereo, including the Batman theme, which may have come from the same Backtrack series.<br /><br />This release of this stereo edition of the album has nothing on the CD itself to differentiate it from the 1995 edition which appeared alongside it on the record shop shelves and which had a sticker saying it was newly remastered and remixed. The publication date on both sleeve and disc is still given as 1995, and the booklet is an exact reprint of the 1995 edition. There is not even a sticker with additional information on the cover of the case of the British re-issue.<br /><br />This poor and rather wasteful promotionand lack of demarcation is a shame because when I finally tracked down the correct copy it more than lived up to expectations. The whole of A Quick One is in full stereo. Run, Run, Run is in a new and slightly longer mix, and all the bonus tracks are stereo too, with the sole exception of the acoustic Happy Jack. This gives a bigger, clearer sound allowing many of the production subtleties to be fully appreciated for the first time thanks to the separation, especially for headphone listening, and particularly enhances the vocal harmonies.<br /><br />The absence of a revised booklet means one unfortunately cannot tell whether these mixes are derived from 1966 stereo masters or were newly created from multi-track tapes for this release.lly tracked down the correct copy it more than lived up to expectations.

B0007Y08II|5.0|A great political satire.  You don't have to be a fan of South Park to enjoy \\"Team America\\".  However, be aware of the type of humor Matt and Trey write.  If you are easily offended, this movie might not be for you.  But if you enjoy comical misinterpretations, plays on words, puppet sex, songs that make fun of themselves, bashing politics, parodied movie scenes, and general toilet humor, you'll enjoy Team America! (F*** YEAH!)

0201633612|4.0|You certainly can't get the information in this book from a more creditable source.  The gang of four has produced an excellent book.  The first two chapters get the reader in the patterns mindset and the document editor example introduces several patterns at a high level. <br /> <br />Though I wouldn't try to read the rest of the book cover to cover as it reads much like a textbook.  It would be best to scan the handy patterns list on the inside cover and jump around to patterns that interest you or you've heard of. <br /> <br />These patterns certainly aren't the silver bullet to your design problems but becoming familiar with them will help you communicate more efficiently with your peers and avoid reinventing the design wheel.  I often implement something and realize it is a pattern and then take a look at this book to see how to improve it.  <br />
B000021XR5|4.0|This is hardly vintage STP. It almost sounds as if Scott got a tape in the mail, sang along to it, and sent it back for mixing (in fact, there is almost no compression in the final mix)....With that said however, I really enjoy the record. For those of you who think STP's best work is Core, then perhaps you should simply buy ''Down'' and ''Sour Girl'' on iTunes and leave it at that. If, on the other hand, you are a True-Blue STP fan (who admired Tiny Music just as much as Core and Purple), then this is definitely an album you should check out. For the first time in their careers, there are  actually throw-away tracks (Pruno and MC5). Despite that however, there is enough diversion and expirimentation on the other 9 tunes to make up for it.  <br /> <br />Another thing to consider when listening to NO. 4, is the state of mind that Scott was in when this album was recorded. Everything from the picture on the inside of the album, to the lyrics in ''I've Got You'' tell the story. He really was on the virge of death. He was actually arrested the day before this album came out.  <br /> <br />Anyway, being a huge fan of Scott Weiland, I really appreciate the tone of the album. It trully is a depressing listen. In my opinion however, that's what makes it good and that's what makes it real.

0316172324|2.0|It breaks my heart to write a negative review of a Malcolm Gladwell work.  Tipping Point was incredibly easy to read and provided useful discussion and thinking points, however the lessons of Blink (if there are any) are difficult to apply and certainly impossible to substantiate, even after you plough through this work (which becomes tedious toward the end).  Blink will not have anywhere near the impact that Tipping Point did (and, from here on in, comparisons to Tipping Point will for Gladwell be inevitable).  The book is well-written and focused.  I still ponder some of the examples give n in the book weeks later -- but a few of the stronger examples are painfully short on detail and their bond to the central theme (which, unfortunately, is obvious to anyone capable of having purchased the book) is fairly loose. <br /> <br />Sadly, Blink reads as though Gladwell had less time, and less inspiration, in its composition.  I have no doubt he'll make up for this on his next work.
B0000DJZB9|4.0|Let me start off my review by saying that I am a huge music buff, and the first time I ever heard Guns 'n Roses' 1987 album \\"Appetite For Destruction\\", I was inspired to keep up on my music studies.  So, even though Guns 'n Roses is not popular anymore, considering the fact that every member of Guns 'n Roses working on their new album is a replacement member of G&R (except for Axl Rose),\\"Welcome To The Videos\\" is a great treat for all fans of Guns 'n Roses.  This DVD has thirteen videos that Guns 'n Roses shot, all of which are great.  While \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" remains the best song by Guns 'n Roses, the best video on this DVD is \\"The Garden\\", which is the exact same thing as \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\"- except it is about New York instead of Los Angeles.  Also, Shannon Hoon sings background vocals on this song, and Alice Cooper even makes a few apppearances on this song singing lead vocals.  The only video on here that should not have made the cut was the video for \\"Garden of Eden\\", and other than the fact that this DVD is missing the videos for \\"Civil War\\", \\"It's So Easy\\", and \\"You Could Be Mine\\", this DVD is still excellent.  Sometimes you might even get a behind the scenes fact for each video before/after they show the video.  Also,look for cameo appearances in some of these videos by Dave Navarro, Pamela Anderson, and Gary Oldman.  Another interesting thing worth mentioning about this DVD is that in some, not all of these videos, Axl Rose either looks like Dana Strum (the bass player for Slaughter), David Lee Roth, David Spade, Kurt Cobain, or Jon Bon Jovi(no,I'm not kidding), and you will even get to see some of Rose's childhood pictures in the video for \\"Live and Let Die\\". In addition to this DVD I also recommend Van Halen's \\"Video Hits Volume One\\" DVD.  I am glad that this DVD was released.  This is a good collection of Guns 'n Roses videos any G&R fan will like.  Axl Rose should be the next President of the USA!
B000020617|3.0|This record was a disappointment for me; especially following up The Colour and The Shape. Stacked Actors is probably the best Foo song ever, but after that it's a pretty weak record. Sure there are some Highlights to follow (Aurora, Ain't it the Life), however they are few and far between. Learn to Fly is the closest Dave Grohl has ever come to selling out completely (although they may be making fun of theirselves), and Breakout is just NOT COOL.  <br /> <br />In addition, this is the only Foo Record that has 100% completely unmemorable songs on it. Live-In-Skin, Headwires, and Gimme Stiches are pointless, uninspired tunes. Generator and Next Year are songs that my girlfriend likes a little too much. And all in all, the last half of the record is all Easy Listening Ballads......sorry. I love the foo fighters too.
B00005YXZH|3.0|The commotion generated by \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" has been tremendous, and in part justified. The clean, spacious sound on the best songs, the pop sensibilities on others, and the slowly ramping build up on others merits recognition. Kamera and War on War sweep the listener away in their energy, while Heavy Metal Drummer conjures up echoes of XTC.<br /><br />On the other hand, the grafting of folk sensibilities with electronic effects sometimes yields a musical Frankenstein that runs amok and lingers on after one wishes the song would mercifully end. Ashes of American Flags provides perhaps the best example of a song that wears out its welcome. This notion of \\"dirtying up\\" the fidelity is certainly not unique---E.S.T do the same thing on their latest release---but what is gained by the lame synthesizers and keyboards that drone on long after some of the songs have clearly expired?<br /><br />If sonic and emotional bleakness are in order, then there is more than enough here, especially on the long tracks I'm Trying to Break Your Heart and Reservations.<br /><br />The balancing act between despairing bleakness and joyous energy rings throughout as a sometimes cacophonous assortment of instruments are summoned and dismissed, like a wizard engaging his familiars for various tasks. Again, the results, in my view, are mixed, working about half the time.<br /><br />This schizoid dualism ultimately means that more folks than would admit it skip around when listening to this CD. For what it's worth, I would suggest 2.5 stars for this one, tilted to 3 stars because of its excellent packaging and concept.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|I love the music on this CD, even though unavoidable sadness and nostalgia accompany my listening pleasure. I grew up to the sound of Ray Charles' voice, his songs...and absolutely loving them. Unfortunately, this album is not a sample of the artist at his best. It is obvious that he was ill and his voice has a strained, almost feeble quality at times. But even in his final studio album, Mr. Charles, \\"the genius,\\" is better than most stylists/musicians at peak form.<br /><br />Ray's sings 12 timeless favorites with younger performers, who have already established themselves as talents, as well as with some older pros. These duets give \\"Genius Loves Company\\" a funky, eclectic sound, and provoke the warm feeling that his legacy has been passed down to another generation. Some of the best cuts include: Charles' duet with B. B. King on \\"Sinner's Prayer.\\" He plays a bluesy piano that goes straight back to his musical roots - fantastic! And with King along on blues guitar, it doesn't get much better!  The sassy version of \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" with James Taylor, and \\"Fever\\" with Natalie Cole are outstanding. He and Elton John do a soulful interpretation of the latter's \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word.\\"<br /><br />\\"Genius Loves Company\\" makes no pretensions. It is an honest album, pleasing, laid-back and memorable because it is Ray Charles's farewell to his fans. I think it is a 'must have' for anyone who loves his music! Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANA
B00005LK95|4.0|If you're from New York City, you'll find this sequel better than the first movie, because of course this sequel is set in the sacred City. <br /> <br />All others will find this sequel not as good as the first movie.  But it is still entertaining.  Fans can revisit their favorite stunts from the first, and there are many new ones.  Cynthia Gibb lends a touch of beauty and charm to this movie, but all too seldom and all too briefly.  There is no female lead, as there was in the first movie--a serious shortcoming.   <br /> <br />Again, the star of the show is #5.  Compared to #5, the actors are inexpressive, simple, repetitive--in short, robot-like.  It's too bad those who designed the gestures and expressions for the robot didn't give a few lessons to the actors.   <br /> <br />If you haven't seen the first, it is recommended that you see it before this one.  And if you liked the first, you'll like this one too.
B000069AUI|1.0|Is it just me, or is the lead singer constipated while he recorded this album?  puh-lease!!!  How dare anybody call this worthless filth \\"music!?\\"
B000002HMH|5.0|Load is actually an awesome hard rock album.  Its not metal, but its still Metallica. Its one of Metallicas best at that.  I cant see how someone could call this a bad album. A lot do  because they want it to be heavier. Its not.  Yes, this album has more groove and slower riffs, but you know they cant make Master Of Puppets over and over again.  I know I wouldnt want them to.  This has an  awesome production, great lyrics, and an overall great feel. Lars' drums sound very good, the guitars are very thick, and James really does great here.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm an old fan of Green Day, in fact they are what got me into punk rock music, they have never written a song which I disliked. They have always been those fast, 3 chord based bratty punk kids who just wanna have fun, but if you pay attention from the course of their 3rd album, DOOKIE, which was really their first hit and sold like, I think 11,000,000 copies they began to change, following up on INSOMNIAC which was angrier, then NIMROD, which in my opinion was like their second best album(this had a sort of mellow and realistic tone to it especially in Walking Alone) then they released WARNING, which was the softer and most realistic album so far. They also released INTERNATIONAL SUPERHITS, which had some of their best tracks, and then came SHENANIGANS(it was a good album just not what I expected after all this) but then when everyone thought they they were gone, came down AMERICAN IDIOT, an album so good, so different that it put all the others off. This is the best cd I have listened to in my life. Starting off with a political punk track called American Idiot, they evolve into a less punkish but more realistic, more touching peace of work(or rather art) called Jesus of Suburbia, a moving rock opera that involves you in such a way you cannot forget, then comes Holiday, another political song which sometimes actually seems better than American Idiot, followed by Boulevard of Broken Dreams this is just what the album needed to make it the best, a very sad, real life type of song which really makes you think, you are walking on a boulevard, down a street which never ends until you die, there are no shortcuts and thats the way it is, its a dog eat dog life and youve got to survive, the album deepens with two more rock operas and ends with the death of st.jimmy and the dissapearence of WHATSERNAME, and of course leaving you breathless
B000089RVX|1.0|This album shows that the music industry has, indeed, fallen.  Considering that every song on this CD has become a #1 hit on top 40 radio shows that it stinks.  Evanescence falls under the same category as such garbage pop artists such as linkin park and trapt who have no musical ability whatsoever. <br />I must've heard My Immortal, Going Under, and Bring Me To Life at least 3 million times each on the radio.  The first time I heard Bring me to life, I thought someone had recorded a cat in pain.  When it turned out to be a real song, I wondered \\"Who the hell makes this garbage anyways?\\"  Ever since, I have been a diehard Evanescence hater. <br />If you like punk, hard rock, metal, or even SOFT ROCK, this music is not for you.  If you like pop or crap, then I would seriously consider this album.  It will be the worst album you've ever added to your collection. <br /> <br />I believe there has been a mistake with the reviewing system, as there is no place to rate this garbage 0 stars.  I do not know whether or not it is a programming error.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Don't think I'm being negative about the album, but Frances the Mute reminds me of a hurricane. Frances the Mute has the force and energy of a hurricane, and just like a hurricane, it is breathtaking and amazing. The album starts off slow just like the light drizzle of rain one would feel at the beginning of a storm. All of a sudden, you are thrust into this tempest that is \\"Cygnus..Vismund Cygnus.\\" The energy builds up and sets the tone with this amazing Latin feel. Then you think the storm has passed when you reach the calm waters of \\"the Widow,\\" and that calmness is ended when you realize that this was only the eye of the hurricane. You are then plunged into the passionate sound of \\"L'Via L'Viaquez,\\" which is incredibly unique and could possibly be the most phenomenal track on the entire album. You are then tossed about the lamenting sound of \\"Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore.\\" This song gives a sense of peace but the lyrics and the music add to the torment of the storm. Finally, you are reaching the end when you come across the utterly amazing song \\"Cassandra Gemini.\\" Immediately you are hit with the energy of the vocals. The music builds you up and takes you through this storm with a whirl of differing sounds that blend beautifully. Once you've passed through this frenzy of feelings, you are reintroduced to the calm waters that assure you that \\"the ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens.\\"  <br /> <br />-Nefstar
B00004Z459|1.0|Bonjour! <br />That is french for hello.  If you are a linkin park fan, you probably didn't know that. <br /> <br />Well, Well, Well, what have we here?  Another masterpiece of random jumbled screaming and a so very horrible DJ put together into an annoying sequence and called a CD. <br />Crappin' Park cannot make music for their lives!!!  This lame excuse for a CD is the weakest debut I've ever seen.  Of all the incompident, stupid moronic idiots, these 5 had to get together and pretend they made something that sounded good.  But, alas, their hopes were in vain, and their \\"hybrid theory\\" was trash. <br />The song Cure for the Itch is pointless, the song One Step Closer is too short, and the song By Myself is too much of a screaming(literally) sensation. <br /> <br />How Do You put a giraffe in the refrigiorator...... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />You open the door, put in the giraffe and close the door. <br /> <br />How do you put an elephant in the refrigiorator? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Open the door, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant, and close the door. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The lion king is hosting a meeting of all the animals.  Which one doesn't attend? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The elephant...he's in the refrigiorator. <br /> <br />You must cross a pirahna-infested river without a boat.  How do you get across? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />you jump in and swim across, the pirahnas are at the lion king's meeting. <br /> <br />If you couldn't figure out the above questions, you are clearly an idiot, and obviously a linkin park fan who thinks my review sucks. <br /> <br />Au Revoir <br />That's french for Goodbye.  If you are a linkin park fan, you probably didn't know that.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|What can I say about SAW other than the acting in this film was atrocious!  I mean, it was laughably bad.  The guy that plays Adam can't say anything without cracking me up.  And chubby Cary Elwes is the epitamy of pompousness, every word he says sounds forced as well.  I know the above sentences don't flow very well but I'm a bit pissed.  I had high hopes for this film and feel so wronged after finally having seen it.  The premise is very intriguing: two strangers wake up in a wickedly dirty bathroom, their feet chained to metal poles, or the wall (does it really matter, just know they were bound).  Throughout the course of the film Elwes says (with an air of righteousness) that they're probably in the clutches of the \\"Jigsaw Killer\\", a serial murderer that kills not so much physically but psychologically.  This concept fascinated me and I'm sorry to say it wasn't executed rightly at all.  Danny Glover stars in his worst role since Predator 2 and adds even more insult to injury as the obsessed detective stopping at nothing to find this horrid killer.  Of course there's plot twists abound, all involving the identity of the killer and a (I have to say) greatly executed sequence involving one of the only survivors of the killer that was really the highlight of the film.  The first viewing of this film left me stunned at what had occurred but after further thought i know why i was stunned: the ending is preposterous, a point which is generally okay in horror films but not okay in a gore hound's wet dream masquerading as a horror film that masquerades as a thriller.  Anyone not likely to catch the idiocy that the ending carries and not likely to care about the bad BAD acting this film is for you.  And, of course, gore-hounds are in for a treat after Elwes puts the saws provided the two near the beginning to good use near the end.  Me, I don't want my hour and a half back.  I want this to be billed as a horror/comedy.  Laughing out loud at this film is very easy especially at the end when Adam screams in agony, pure gold.  I know it sounds awful but, I am saying this, watch this film and see for yourself.  Most love this movie and that's fine, it's an American Film, all gore, nothing to back it up, except an interesting premise that's shot all to hell by the bad acting and unbelievebly idiotic and/or unbelievable plot twists.
B000089RVR|1.0|A more accurate name for this highly overrated popstar is Dild0.  She has the most monotonous, idiotic, and british accented voice ever.  The first single, White Flag, represents this entire mess easily.  I would reccomend that only people who like Modest Mouse invest in this british crap. <br /> <br />and the grand total rating...0 stars!
0767834739|5.0|Picking up from where Resident Evil left off, Apocalypse sheds light on events surrounding Raccoon City following Alice's exit from the Umbrella laboratory facilities. <br />The virus has now spread above ground and the Umbrella cooperation has sealed off the town, which is crawling with zombies.  Civilians and security forces alike are trying to survive and find some way to get out.  In the midst of this pandemonium, Alice has teamed up with an unlikely group in search of the creator's daughter who is none other than the girl whose image had been given to the Red Queen's holograph back in the Hive. <br />Milla Jovovich and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well!  The only setback is in relation to the part where she, yet again, finds herself trembling/twitching/hurting/screaming etc Have mercy on us please... Can we please have a movie with Milla Jovovich not acting like that (i.e. EXACTLY as she does in the Fifth Element, in Joan of Arc and in the original Resident Evil)?  Is that too much too ask???  It gets tiring after a while!!! <br />Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the battles are all very good!  The film does a GREAT job of establishing a cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch! <br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 Stars <br />
B00008H2LB|1.0|Meteora is the death of music.  Plain and simple. <br />Let me begin by stating that this is not music.  This is screaming.  How they pushed 5 singles out of this album is beyond me. <br />Forward, the most pointless waste of 13 seconds, kicks off this CD.  Sadly, the sound of thumping and glass breaking represents basically the rest of the CD. <br />Don't Stay comes next.  Not a very impressive first song. <br />If we jump to Breaking The Habit, this is the lamest attempt at an emotional song EVER!!!  Chester F!ckington or whatever his name is still screams, even though this song is intended to be slow and mellow. <br />The song Numb is a drastic last impression.  It made it to the top 5 on 2 charts: <br />1. The Top 40 charts <br />2. My chart of Horrid songs that should have been thrown out as soon as they were finished recording them. <br />An overview of the album: <br />it is sucky, screaming, and repetitave. <br /> <br />Please save your money and invest it elsewhere. <br />
B0006SSOHC|4.0|So many people have dissed this film because of the \\"bad acting,\\" and \\"excessive gore.\\" Well, maybe it is because I'm a dumb horror fan who is used to the so called \\"bad acting,\\" but I really liked this film!<br /><br />Don't listen to those neanderthal whiners, the acting is fine, and it was not as gory as I expected, but did have some great bloody scenes, as it should! When you pick up a case that has a sawed off limb on it, then expect to see some carnage...morons.<br /><br />I'd catagorize this more as a psychological thriller. It starts off with a doctor and a freelance photographer, who are chained in a bathroom, on opposite ends. Between them is a dead body holding a gun and a tape recorder. In each of the mens' pockets is a micro tape with instructions on it. Through the dialouge, the viewer picks up on the fact that there is more to these men than meets the eye.<br /><br />Won't say more about the plot, you need to just go into this without any semi-spoilers. GREAT ENDING!<br /><br />From one horror fan to another, check this puppy out!
B000088E6D|5.0|While I'm a new inductee to the music of MR.Buble, I'm no newbe to good music and this is good music. Well produced and well sung, it's a very impressive album. Truly enjoyable.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First off I just want to say that I have been listening to Green Day for as long as I can remember.  I have every cd they have released, and bought this cd on the day it came out.  Once I put it in to listen to it for the first time, I was blown away.  It is different from all of their other cds, but not in a bad way.  They really tried to make something new and different with this CD.  The cd starts out with American Idiot, a song against the American media, etc, then goes into the first 9 minute song on the album, Jesus of Suburbia.  From there on, the CD tells the story of someone called the Jesus of Suburbia and his alter ego St. Jimmy.  Once you start listening to it, you cant stop.  It sounds like a mix of the Green Day albums.  It has songs like St. Jimmy and American Idiot which are Dookie/Insomniac/Kerplunk like.  Then there are more mellow songs like Wake Me Up When September Ends, which is more along the lines of the song Good Riddance off of Nimrod.        Overall, this is a great cd, probably my favorite cd of all time. It sounds like a mix of all the Green Day cds, but at the same time completly different.  If you are a fan of Green Day, definitely pick it up.  Even if you are just a fan of music in general, check it out, you just might like it.    rant  Also, I have seen a lot of people who hate this cd because it is not \\"punk\\".  First off, why do you care if it is punk or not?  \\"If you like the music listen to it.\\" - My cool friend Natalie. Also, they say that \\"punk\\" is about being different, but yet they also say that they have to have a certain sound and attitude.  I dont care if you just dont like the cd, you can think what you want, but dont hate it because it is not \\"punk\\" or because they are \\"sellouts\\".  /rant
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble has penned a classic tender love ballad with his aptly titled Home where you see and feel the world through his own emotional viewpoint. It is a poignant and loving song like I haven't heard in a long time. It's Time is the right name for this fine piece of work. It is time for us to witness the emergence of a true talent in the music business who sings like the late greats and moves you with his passion - the ingredient that makes this such a great work of art. <br />True to love the ballads You and I and Song for you have that same loving feel and their warmth and honesty is appreciated.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|These movies were already a good even before they became DvDs.<br /><br />george lucas knew this and toke advantage of it and did a good job. besides cleaning up the film itself and a few scene edits, its realy just the old movies on DVD. so if you have the movies already then i wouldn't get then unless yours are worn out. but over all a realy good mvie to watch......
B00005YW4H|5.0|Excellent work by an interesting and talented woman. Courageous and talented Miss Jones shows that you can do great work without comprising.
B00005JMAH|1.0|This movie was a let down.  The new directer was terrible.  It did not follow the book and it completely changed the way characters and places looked.  The new Dumbledore was good except his beard and hair was not long enough or white enough, something they could have changed.  The acting is poor also.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) is awful and so is Emma Watson (Hermoine), though Rupert did a fair job.  While its hardly ok to have the other two and not this one it does not compare.
6302763835|5.0|So when is this great old film coming out on DVD?????? Many of us are eagerly waiting for this one to add to our library. I put this one right up there with \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" & \\"Creature From the Black Lagoon\\".  These are always great for repeat viewings on Sunday afternoons..
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This was the only movie I've ever gone to that I've contemplated leaving because it was so bad, but it was only bad for ten minutes, the rest was delightful. I'm angry that they killed \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"Music of the Night\\".  Emmy Rossum looks like a reject from the Rocky Horror Picture Show and rides a horse through the bowls of the opera house. She also looks like she got drugged with something during \\"Music of the Night\\". I will purchase the movie because I can skip these horrible two numbers, which is a shame because these two songs are two of my favorites. The sets and costumes are great, the supporting actors (not the three primary ones) make the movie worth watching. But be warned that these ten minutes are bad!
0553573403|2.0|It's absolultely astounding that the blurb on the back of the book compares it to The Lord of the Rings. It's a bloody waste of time. Just finished reading the last book and I really shouldn't have bothered. Pah!
0385510454|2.0|I really think that it's time for Mr. Grisham to take a break.  His recent books have been utterly boring and repetitive.  I used to have a hard time putting his books down because I was hooked.  Now I have a hard time picking them up and The Broker was no different.  The idea was great but it just dragged on and on.  Half of the book was dedicated to Italy.  Move on already..<br /><br />\\"The Broker\\" takes up a new life in a small Italian town as Marco Lazerri. A good deal of the middle of the book is taken up with intenisve Italian lessons. Yes, Italian lessons, and not a little sightseeing. Anyhow, the day arrives when the CIA leaks Backman's location to the major satellite players. Now, the CIA can sit back and see which player arrives to remove Backman permanently. That will tidy up their file on the satellite mess.<br /><br />I recommend skipping this one.
B000001ESF|5.0|This cd is a really really good cd. It is probably one of rush's greatest cd of all time. 2112 the song is a 20 minute masterpiece.

B00003CXHJ|3.0|Okay.  We've heard it already.  The history in this film is not accurate.  As I said in my review for another notoriously inaccurate film, _The Patriot_, however, it does not really matter.  If one is turning to Hollywood to receive an education in history, then naturally they will be disappointed.  Do these films help contribute to a false sense of patriotism in the public masses?  They probably do, but let us judge _U-571_ for what it is: a Hollywood picture.  It is not an historical documentary.  It is an action film that loosely takes its subject matter on submarine warfare during WWII.  Let's move on with our lives.<br /><br />All that being said, _U-571_ is a standard action film--no more, no less.  It's action scenes are fairly well done, particularly the scenes in which the protagonists are being depth-charged by a German destroyer.  Matthew McConaughey gives a fairly good performance as a popular lieutenant who is forced to take over the burden of command during a secret operation that goes awry.  As a few reviewers have commented, however, I too noticed that the film failed to really pull me into the claustrophobic atmosphere of the submarine.  Something was missing from the suspense.  Even during the obligatory \\"let's see how deep the sub can dive without being crushed\\" scene, a real sense of danger was nevery truly established, leaving the audience wanting more in terms of nail-biting suspense.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, if you enjoy submarine action flicks, I don't think you can go wrong with _U-571_.  While there are better submarine films out there (_Das Boot_), I've certainly seen a few that were far worse.  If you're looking for a film to unwind with on a Friday night, give this one a look.
B000001ZSE|5.0|Images is the second album I owned, after Jarre Live.  I have since purchased every major Jarre album and I still do not regret owning Images.  While the version I own has 17 tracks, Jarre remixes several of them and includes transitional sound effects and music \\"to create a continuous one hour [program]\\" (as translated from his liner notes).  Indeed, listening to Images is more like listening to a medley, with each track blending well into the other tracks, or fading out to create phases.  On one hand, Jarre cuts many of his tracks in half or in thirds, while on the other hand he has created a 62 minute electronic smorgasbord of his popular works.<br /><br />Opinions on the remixes vary.  While I haven't sat down and noted every difference, I can say off the top of my head that I prefer the somewhat frightening intro to Oxygene 2 on Images.  The particles of music here sound fuller.  Jarre adds thunder and rain effects to L'Orchestre sous la pluie, making it a fanciful delight to listen to, with atmosphere to boot!<br /><br />Calypso 3 has some extraneous music (fifteen seconds or so) removed from the middle and actually tightens the track up quite nicely (with headphones you can hear the splice).  Since this is what I became used to, after purchasing En Attendant Cousteau, I realized he did the right thing on Images.<br /><br />And Rendez-Vous 2 has an awesome chorus singing with power throughout this track, rather than the weak synth vibe that is on the original album.  Bravo!<br /><br />A pleasant surprise awaits you when you open the insert booklet, too.  A nice note (in French) handwritten by Mr. Jarre himself, dedicating the music to the listener.  I thought it was a nice touch.  I can't wait for Aero to be released (the American version) as it has some fantastic sounding remixes on it as well.<br /><br />One note: I noticed at a store years ago that they re-released Images with a slightly different hue to the cover.  Also, they added Wooloomooloo (from Zoolook).  A reviewer here mentions Blah Blah Caf&eacute; (also from Zoolook) on the 24-bit remaster version.  Expect to receive a disc that slightly varies on tracklisting than is posted here.Caf (also from Zoolook) on the 24-bit remaster version.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|By now you should now the plot of _Same Time, Next Year_, that of a long-standing yearly affair that continues over a twenty-six year period.  The charm of this film lies in its clever writing and extraordinary development, a growth that occurs along three lines.  Throughout the film, we witness the maturing of both Allan Alda's and Ellen Burstyn's characters as they go through life, the maturing of their unusual but intimate relationship, and the passage of time in the nation's history that surrounds them.  We get to see the ways in which their lives and relationship are affected by the tremendous change around them.  This complex interaction transfers wonderfully from the stage to the screen in the capable hands of its director, Robert Mulligan, a man who also brought us the classic _To Kill a Mockingbird_.<br /><br />While some have commented on the film's questionable morality, I believe that the film effectively explores the notion that one can find remarkable chemistry in more than one person.  Besides, their love cannot be reduced to a carnal physical love.  Despite the fact that sexuality certainly comes into play, this film does not make much of it, choosing instead to focus upon their chemistry and deepening relationship.  Moreover, it is the wonderful dialogue between Alda and Burstyn, not to mention their tremendous acting, that solidifies this picture as a movie gem.  My only minor complaint is the awkward splicing of picture stills between scenes.  While they do give you a sense of the cultural history surrounding the scenes, they get a little over the top, particularly when combined with the film's sentimental theme.  It's not a real complaint, however, and I recommend _Same Time, Next Year_ with no reservations.
B000005ILF|5.0|I never considered myself a Sting fan.  I've always liked his singles and some of his  Police material.  In college, I would hang out with friends and one of them always had Mercury Falling playing on the stereo.  I asked to borrow it, liking what I heard.  Little did I realize what a gem of an album this truly was.<br /><br />It's interesting to read people saying this is not his greatest album.  I've tried his other albums.  The only one suited to me is Mercury.  It is a haunted album...cold...suspended like large flakes of snow in a winter still life.  There is something infinitely sad here.  I do not know what was going on in Sting's personal life, nor do I care.  He wrote his music for him, I bought it for me.<br /><br />I own only two distinctly quiescent albums, of which Mercury is one and Elton John's The Big Picture is the other.  Both make for fine listening, but I relate more to Sting's music.  Also, his is more interesting to sing along with.<br /><br />While each track stands on its own, the ones that distinctly stand out are:<br /><br />The Hounds of Winter.  A great way to begin a somewhat forlorn album.  It is Sting waking to a lonely, depressing winter morning, walking through the day without his love.  The music is frighteningly enveloping.  I tend to forget it is a song until it ends.<br /><br />I Was Brought To My Senses.  This song starts so slowly that I actually first listened to it entirely months after I had bought the album.  Little did I realize that a little more than a minute and a half in begins one of the most remarkable songs I've heard.  It was a description of my own revelations...revelations we each have every day, sometimes ignored.  This is somewhat a sequel to Hounds, or perhaps a parallel event, only far happier.<br /><br />La Belle Dame Sans Regrets.  A joy to listen to.  I know enough French to get a gist of what's going on.  If you enjoy this little ditty, I highly recommend checking out Billy Joel's C'Etait Toi (You Were the One) off his Glass Houses album.  They both make wonderful love songs.<br /><br />Valparaiso.  Not for all tastes, but this song conjures mists over the water, the sounds of lapping waves, starry night skies far from lands with electricity, a woman whom you love, and the love of the open seas.  I live on the marina and at night, watching boats drift silently by, I always sing to myself, \\"Red the port light, starboard the green.\\"  It never fails.<br /><br />The art direction is superb, and contributes greatly to the album as a whole.  Jeri Heiden, whose credits I Googled and are too vast to list, did a fabulous job \\"silvering\\" and sepia-toning Sting's world in his forest.  In one photograph, by the way, you can see Sting sitting before a fireplace, six-string guitar in his lap, lined music paper in front of him.  I wonder if that's where he writes sometimes?ke wonderful love songs.    Valparaiso.

In one photograph, by the way, you can see Sting sitting before a fireplace, six-string guitar in his lap, lined music paper in front of him.  I wonder if that's where he writes sometimes?
B0006SSOHM|5.0|Everyone who says this movie sucks just go jerk off to some romantic comdey or something. This is the most impressive horror movie in a long time. Ths first time director did a hell of a job. Although its not full a five star film its more like a 4.6 but i still put a five here. It has all the elements that us true horror fans are used to. So this movie is really good (considering i went to see it with little hopes it would be this good). Fans enjoy!
0385337388|1.0|This book came out in the wake of similar titles like MASH and Catch-22, and describes life as an intern at a hospital in the 1970s. I read it in 1997, and it made me very sad about the state of medicine in this country. <br /> <br />Fortunately, reading some of the some of the location descriptions in the book, it dawned on me that the hospital in the book is Beth Israel in Boston, where I grew up. <br /> <br />I mentioned the book and my realization to my mother, who said that back in the 1960s and 70s, Beth Israel had the reputation of being more or less a butcher shop, a good place to go if you wanted to wind up dead nice and fast, vastly different from their current positive reputation.
B000002HEP|5.0|Now that I have your attention--I'll make it brief.  Others have rated this creation much more eloquently than I, therefore, I'll keep it primitive.  This short-lived band has made an impact not unlike Ozzy and Co. in the 70's.  They are the god(grandfathers) of stoner rock like BS was of HEAVY ROCK.  If you're like me and have been in the abyss searching for rightful B.S. heirs, rejoice!!!  This will satisfy your jonesin' tendencies.  I envy you cause you've yet to experience the vibes that you thought were gone forever.  That experience is behind me now.  Sure, your older now, have a decent job, a good family and are realizing your mortality.  No problem, this CD will ROCK YOU INTO THE VOID.  Seriously, don't let your headstone read \\"This fool failed to hear Kyuss during his brief existence\\".  If you haven't-you MUST and will now-I envy you :)
B00070Q7VO|3.0|He can sing yes. But he has no originality! Almost every song is a cover and Try a little tenderness is such a classic. Total rock and he slows it down and makes to song boring.
B0007O38F8|3.0|I want to start off by asking, \\"Why is 50 Cent so popular?\\" Yeah, he has some catchy hooks and a few good tracks under his belt, but he's no Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas(back in the day). He's not even a better rapper than Eminem. In fact, I think Eminem is the best rapper out right now with Biggie dead, Jay retired and Nas having fell off. 50 is so arrogant and he just swears that he's got it going on. Now, I can't front, he is the hottest rapper out right now. Not the best rapper, not the most original, just the hottest. What I mean by that is, he's just really popular. Everybody wants his music. I can't really explain why he's so hot. He's really average lyrically, he usually has really good beats and hot hooks, but I wouldn't call him great or anything. I read somewhere that he feels if this album doesn't sell as much as \\"Get Rich...\\" he's failed. Well, 50, you failed. YOu should have used more Dre beats and the Eminem produced \\"Gatman and Robin\\" is not only a wack track, but it's really annoying to listen to. Anyway, here's the rundown: <br />Intro: Terrible and very unoriginal. I don't even know why it's on the CD. <br /> <br />In My Hood: 3 stars. Typical 50 cent; good hook, good beat, average lyrics. <br /> <br />This is 50: This IS 50. Same ol' 50 gangsta music. 3 stars <br /> <br />I'm Supposed to Die...: 4 1/2 stars. One of the best tracks if not THE best track.  <br /> <br />Piggybank: 3 stars. If you're gonna start a beef on record, it should be a little better lyrically. He's gonna get killed by Jadakiss.  <br /> <br />Gatman and Robin: 1 star. This is one of the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  <br /> <br />Candy Shop: 4 stars. Some people think this sounds like Magic Stick, I don't. The beat hits so hard, I just love this joint.  <br /> <br />Outta Control: 4 stars. Typicaal 50 cent track, but I really love listening to it for some reason. I think it's a Dre beat.  <br /> <br />Get In My Car: 4 stars. \\"B**** get in!\\" This track isn't great, but the hookis so funny it got an extra star.  <br /> <br />Ski Mask Way: 2 stars. Corny thug music <br /> <br />A Baltimore Love...: 2 stars. 50 cent is no storyteller. He tries to be original, but I'm not feeling this.  <br /> <br />Ryder Music: 1 star. I don't ride to this <br /> <br />Disco Inferno: 2 stars. It's not a bad track, but it might as well be called \\"In the Club part 2\\" <br /> <br />Just a lil bit: 3 stars. Pretty good.  <br /> <br />Gunz come out: 1 star. Why is this on the CD? <br /> <br />My Toy Soldier: 1 star. Why is this on the CD? <br /> <br />Position of Power: 1 star. I'm not going to ask the same question again.  <br /> <br />Build you up: 3 stars. This track sounds good because the tracks before it were so wack. It's actually not the typical 50 gangster nonsense, but it's a good track. <br /> <br />God gave me...: 1 star. I HATE when people talk about murdering people and God on the same CD.  <br /> <br />So Amazing: 1 star. Man, I thought the whole rap with an R&B hook went out in like '99. <br /> <br />I don't need 'em: 2 stars. 50 is harder than ever on this track.It seems like he wants to alienate anyone close to him. I would hate to be one of G-Unit.  <br /> <br />Hate it or love it (REMIX): 4 stars. I love the original version with just Game and 50. I would give the original 5 stars, but this one just doesn't sound right with five dudes rapping on it. IT sounds like an old WuTang song with so many people on it, not to mention their verses weren't that hot and 50 kept his same verse on it.

(Finally a show that keeps us on our toes with honest to goodness daily goings on instead of fantasy crap that does not and will never happen.)

B00004S367|5.0|Stevie Wonder has been called a genius for many years now, and I seriously find it hard to disagree with this. The man is simply amazing, and his talent is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Brilliant songwriter, lyricist, musician and person in general, he deserves every single accolade he receives, and then some.<br /><br />On this early-1972 effort, Stevie is pretty much a one-man band (as said in the liner notes): with the exception of a guitar solo in one track, and a trombone solo in another track, Stevie plays *all* of the instruments; drums, clavinet, bass, organ, piano, harmonica, clavichord, synthesizers -- he does it all, and what's also astonishing is how adept he is at assembling these instruments to create works so beautiful, moving and captivating. Oh, and he also does most of the producing as well.<br /><br />Some of my favorites from this album:<br /><br />\\"Love Having You Around\\" is a song possibly written for Stevie's wife at the time. A steady groove is punctuated by various synthesizer textures and vocal effects which lead to a triumphant (although brief) chorus. The track is over seven minutes long, but it never drags, and seems like it ends all too quickly, since it's as engrossing as it is.<br /><br />\\"Superwoman\\" is pretty much divided into two distinct halves. The first half is comprised of the most beautiful, intimate R&B to be heard. The brilliant jazzy chords and progressions maximize the dreamy, floating feel, and Stevie's breathy vocals are the guide to this ethereal, yet earthy masterpiece; it's the equivalent of a reflective Summer day, with a cool, gentle breeze for good measure. Almost equal to that of the dreamy artwork. The second half is a post-psychedelic, trippy, yet atmospheric smorgasbord of synthesizer-drenched chords, impassioned vocals and some guitar solos. Excellent stuff, here.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Little Girl\\" is one of Stevie's pleasantly goofy character impersonation-filled tracks. On the verses, Stevie sings in his natural, beautiful voice, which is backed by a funky soundscape of the clavinet, bass, drums, and some harmonica. Then, on the chorus (if it's technically a chorus), the tempo changes, and he goes into this goofy, drawl-filled dialogue about how his girl treats him bad. It's hilarious as all hell.<br /><br />\\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\" is Stevie on the clavinet (or the clavichord, or synthesizer), and produces a song which is almost Paul McCartneyesque in it's melodicism. A beautiful song, and Stevie's vocals are sweet and pleasantly sugary. The keys that Stevie is using seems to mimic arpeggiated guitar chords.<br /><br />\\"Keep On Running\\" is jittery, rapid-fire funk, and in some ways, it's ominous; as if we feel and sense that something in the shadows is about to jump out and grab us, as the lyrics suggest. The pulsating rhythm which embeds the melody is utterly foreboding, and Stevie's vocals sound slightly hazy, but not lacking the passion that is always present. But, in the least, this fast thing will get that old rump of yours shaking.<br /><br />\\"Evil\\" is the most heart-wrenching track on the album. It's one of the earliest examples in regard to Stevie's socially-conscious musings; here, he talks about the evils of life (e.g. hatred, poverty.) It's a dramatic track, in which things start off low-key, only to escalate in atmosphere and dynamics as time progresses. The keys and synthesizers plow along, eventually reaching powerful orchestral crescendos and choir-like effects, and all along, Stevie's vocals get more intense, dramatic and emotive. All of this breaks me down everytime I hear the track; the passion in the guy's voice, alone, is enough to send one to tears.<br /><br />There really isn't much more that I can say. Stevie's a genius, and his music is recommended to anyone who is willing to be moved by greatness, regardless of musical preference. You will probably want to own this, and everything up to 1976's _Songs In The Key of Life_, as it represents the best of Stevie Wonder. This album in particular will hold a special place in the hearts of many, due to it's unique, intimate charm.as it represents the best of Stevie Wonder.

B000001ABD|5.0|This is an excellent compilation from Stevie Wonder's body of work. I was so pleased to find \\"Lately\\", \\"Overjoyed\\", and \\"These Three Words\\" included with all the other well-known favorites. Stevie Wonder is classic, and if you haven't realized that by now, buy this collection. And you should also buy \\"Songs In the Key of Life, Vols. 1 & 2\\" for the uplifting love songs \\"As\\" and \\"If Its Magic.\\" I love those songs, and you will, too. His voice is pure and he doesn't try too hard. He just sings. Buy these albums, it's a wise investment.
B000002I4W|5.0|The title of this review will probably scare the living daylights out of fans who can't stand a whole bunch of dissonant, skronking noise. But, fear not, because this landmark 1959 album by the great Ornette Coleman isn't all that noisy in the least; in fact, I think it's one of the most beautiful pieces of music to be experienced - jazz or otherwise.<br /><br />Indeed, my guess is this: what lends the \\"free\\" title to this album is the notion of implied chords. You see, most jazz records feature instruments like the piano - instruments that are capable of -- and are often -- producing full chords (a \\"full\\" chord typically consists of at *least* three notes to be considered as such -- mainly the root, third and fifth.) On this album, there is not a single piano in site, nor is there any other instrument here that can produce a full chord, or at least not in the typical sense. So, instead, these \\"implied\\" chords are only hinted at, perhaps by some of the sequencing of notes coming from the lead instruments, and the solos they tend to produce.<br /><br />But, through all of this, you would expect to hear a bunch of sloppy, nonsensical riff-raff. Not a chance. The way Ornette and the other players comprised of this quartet pull this technique off is nothing short of astounding. What's more amazing? Some of this stuff is absolutely gorgeous. The melodies are a bit unusual, yet somehow hypnotic and entrancing.<br /><br />Ornette's later albums would become more extreme in the \\"free\\" category, and would be hard to approach for the casual fan. But, here, you can get a glimpse of what would be found in some of Ornette's later, more extreme efforts: The supercharged, free-flowing, rapid-fire, yet elegant dueling/soloing between Ornette (sax) and Don Cherry (trumpet) heard on \\"Eventually\\" echoes many of the musings found in a lot of his later work; this is the equivalent of Ornette's signature sound. Yet, on here, it doesn't get so extreme, as to become unbearable to sit through.<br /><br />You'll probably want to add this to your collection alongside such other 1959 classics (e.g. Dave Brubeck's _Time Out_, John Coltrane's _Giant Steps_, Miles Davis' _Kind of Blue_, Charles Mingus' _Mingus Ah Um_.) It comes highly recommended - jazz novice or diehard fan.want to add this to your collection alongside such other 1959 classics (e.g. Dave Brubeck's _Time Out_, John Coltrane's _Giant Steps_, Miles Davis' _Kind of Blue_, Charles Mingus' _Mingus Ah Um_.)

B00070Q7VO|3.0|Michael Buble has a very good singing voice, of that there is no doubt - it's smooth yet clean and clear. On this and his previous album he does his best to demonstrate that he's no one-trick-pony, by mixing in pop, latino and Motown stuff amongst the big band and crooners' numbers, with mixed results. <br /> <br />The slightly quirky duet of \\"Quando...\\" with Nelly Furtado sounds nice, \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\", also given the latin soft-shoe shuffle, works as well. Even the plaintive Leon Russell and Stevie Wonder songs are passable. But \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" sounds as if someone listened to Ella Fitzgerald's version and decided they could do better, and it has ended up sounding little better than a catfight. <br /> <br />Buble's self-penned (with help) love song \\"Home\\" is beautiful, but a bit out of place here. It sounds country to me - it's just begging for one of Nashville's finest to pick up on it and have a huge hit with it. <br /> <br />This would all be fine. But to find the one big drawback with this album all you have to do is listen to track 7, \\"The More I See You\\". It's vibrant, alive, dynamic, and all the backing band are live and real, even if they were recorded in three different places. The rest of the album suffers from a suffocating, sterile, super-slick production that makes you feel as if you're listening to it in a soundproof booth - I suppose if you like using closed headphones all the time it's OK, but I don't like it. There's plenty of bass but little dynamism or depth. In addition, although the solo instruments in the backing are real the brass and strings aren't, and you can tell they aren't, and that is unforgiveable. <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|One of those rare albums where just about every song is great.  No filler here.  I bought it after seeing \\"Hysteria\\" video on TV and definitely did not regret it.  If you like this song, you will like the whole album.
B00002N9ER|1.0|I was very dissappointed with this item.  Didn't last a day.  The Streamlight Adjust-a-Clamp is VASTLY superior.  Stainless steel construction and it's CHEAPER too.  My current Streamlight set has been in heavy constant use in my truck for over 15 years.  The rubber has worn off a few times but it STILL HOLDS MY FLASHLIGHT!  Customers who were unhappy with the MAG instrument product should check out the Streamlight clamps.
B00078XKDE|3.0|No Wow sees the band continuing to expand on the sound they showed in Keep on Your Mean Side. Here, it's darker more moody and tighter than in their debut releases. If you're new to the band, the closest comparison is to The White Stripes. The Kills are a two person band consisting of Hotel and VV, both of whom do vocal duty on the album.     The Kills play bluesy garage rock/punk led by throbbing guitars, strong bass lines and monotonous drum machine drumming. The vocals are strong again and the well written lyrics are delivered with sexy female and pleasant male vocals. VV, the female singer performs most of the vocal duties here which is a good thing since her voice fits well with the sort of music they play.    Song highlights include the opener \\"No Wow\\" which is led by throbbing guitars, strong bass lines and a droll drum beat. This is accented well by Hotel's somewhat whispered vocals and a strong performance from VV. \\"Dead Road 7\\" is a strong, tight track driven by strong bass and well delivered lines. There are other good tracks on there with some weaker ones as well. One problem I had is that a lot of the songs sound a bit too similar to one another. I was never a fan of drum machines and this album doesn't do much to sway my opinion as the droll, boring drumming takes away from the overall quality of this somewhat minimalistic recording.    What The Kills have here is a relatively strong Garage Rock release that should please fans of their earlier work. If you like bands like The White Stripes or the Yeah Yeah Yeahs then you might like what you find here. 3 1/2 stars.
B0007O38F8|3.0|I knew when this cd dropped that it would not be as good as Get Rich Or Die Tryin Just buy the singles 50 put out, The Massacre doesnt dissapoint to much for die Hard 50 cent fans, there are still some hot tracks but not near as many as his first album has.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Frances the Mute is The Mars Volta's second full length release. Deloused in the Comatorium was a promising debut after an equally good EP. It was heralded by critics and fans alike. Frances the Mute continues along the path The Mars Volta took in Deloused but it also finds the band adding some new elemnents to their sound. Some of these additions work while others just serve to dilute the songs. <br /> <br />Cedric Bixler is the biggest draw for me. The instrumental work is decent but then band is nothing without Cedric's excellent voice and lyrics. Here, as in Deloused, Cedric's voice is strong on every track. Frances also finds Bixler experimenting with voice manipulation. Although, not a big part of the album, what's there does serve as a detriment to the album. Cedric has a great voice but he should leave the manipulation to singers more adapt in that area like Mr.Doctor(Devil Doll) and Mike Patton(Fantomas, Mr.Bungle). When Cedric does it, it just sounds odd, unnatural and out of place. <br /> <br />As in Deloused and Tremulant, the songs are lengthy. The shortest clocks in at 5 minutes, 3 clock in at 12-13 minutes and yet another clocks in at over 30 minutes. Now, length is never a problem for me. Some of the greatest songs of the modern era like Devil Doll's Dies Irae or The girl who was...death clock in at above an hour. Here, however, the songs feel overly lengthy. There are parts in every song that just don't add anything to the music. <br /> <br />There's boring ambient noise in each of the tracks that serves to dilute the overall sound. It's almost as if the boys at The Mars Volta, known ecentrics, added it to make it seem more 'experimental'. Well, I enjoy experimental music as much as the next guy but only when it works. It doesn't work here. Even the widow feels to long with only 3 minutes of passable music and two minutes of needless noise. I can enjoy a 13 minute song as much as the next guy but here in Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus we have an 8 minute song masquerading as a 13 minute one. It's just not needed and makes the overall album less pleasing. If there was more cohesion to this album, it could have easily been a 5 star release. There are some 5 star moments in here but also some 1 or 2 star moments that serve to bring down the overall quality of each song. <br /> <br />It is easy to tell The Mars Volta's influences on this album as well. Deloused was more of an original release than this. Parts of Via l'Viaquez sound like a Santana song with a different vocalist. Yet, another part of that song made me recall parts of the Kill Bill soundtrack. Other influences like Robert Plant and Jimmy Page are clearly heard in the album. It's nice when artists are influenced by others but here it seems that they filch a thing too many from others instead of shaping their own sound. <br /> <br />Frances the Mute is a good album despite it's flaws. Some better editing on the part of the band along with removal of about 10-15 minutes on needless noise could have made this a really strong album. The album has been receiving the \\"It's weird and we don't understand it so it must be brilliant treatment\\". I'm all for experimental sounds but some of it here just doesn't work. If you are looking some good and original experimental music check out better releases like Choirs of the Eye by Kayo Dot. However, if you want a good albeit a bit muddled rock release with a good vocalist then you'll like this. If you liked Deloused then you'll probably like this as well. Just be wary that it introduces some detrimental aspects and suffers from lack of cohesion. With some better editing this could have been one of the best releases in years. As it stands, it's a good release that doesn't quite reach greatness due to some unneeded boring parts.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|I can't argue that Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor.  I've loved him since I first saw Edward Scissorhands, but I  don't think that he was able to act out his full potential in this movie. Most of the movie revolves around the stiff, almost deadpan relationship between him and his wife, so the movie plays a bit slow.  If there had been more scenes with J.M. Barrie and the boys in imaginative situations, I think this movie would have been more of a hit.  The movie didn't start to get really interesting and inspiring until about the last 10 minutes. I was a bit disappointed, because I was looking forward to this movie, but I don't really think it's a must-have for one's dvd library. It's too bad because I really think this movie would have been able to be a classic had it not focused so much on Barrie and his wife.
B00079018K|3.0|Kasabian is another of those bands that suffers from too much pre-release hype. That's not to say this is a bad album. There is a lot of good stuff to be heard here.    Kasabian combine rock, techno and pop to form a unique amalgamation of the sounds of each genre. There is a bit of Stereolab in there, a bit of U2, a bit of Stone Roses. L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) has a distinctly U2 chorus backed by a toe tapping dance beat. Reason Is Treason is a Stereolab song with a different singer. Lead singer Tom Meighan has a good enough voice at times sounding like Mick Jagger, at times sound like Bono.    The first single Club Foot is probably the best song on the album. Based on a groovy muddled guitar line and drum line and sang with equally muddled vocals. It includes a great, catchy chorus too. There are other good tracks on there too. Processed Beats has a very Beck feel to it with some well delivered vocals. I.D. is a strong vocal track, almost Radiohead like, with a good back beat.    The boys from England know what makes heads bop. This is a great club album with strong dance beats backed by some decent vocals. However, some of the songs feel overly long and could use some trimming. These songs are nothing amazing but they are catchy and although they borrow heavily from other artists, they still manage to feel fresh. I recommend this album if you're a fan of The Rapture, Radiohead, The Stones Roses, Nine Inch Nails or are looking for some good Dance Rock/Britpot. 3 1/2 Stars.

0393312836|5.0|It may well be true that Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the rare few occasions of a film being more - or at the very least as powerful and effective as the novel on which it was based (the only other such case I can think of being 'The Shining', also by Mr. Kubrick). That film is, without a doubt, one of the great masterpieces in cinema history and is mandatory viewing. That doesn't mean Burgess's novel is not praiseworthy. In fact, it's a fantastic piece of literature that, though it was overshadowed by its fantastic cinematic adaptation, is comparable to Orwell's 1984 in quality as well as in themes and ideas, and if you liked the film then the novel is well worth your time as well. <br /> <br />The comparison to 1984 comes quite naturally because they both run along the same veins of futuristic thinking, and both deal with similar subjects of free will, individual freedom, violence and alienation in a technologically advanced society - though from entirely different points of view. Burgess chose - as you well know if you've seen the film - the point of view of Alex, a teenage delinquent and a violent criminal, in a futuristic New York where teenage gangs rule the night and have their own way with innocent, law-abiding citizens. We see this world through Alex's eyes, and so receive a very disturbing view of this reality; Alex sees the violence and death in a humorous, indifferent way, and so the novel is often hilarious and constantly shocking. A reviewer noted that nowadays, the idea of a fifteen year old committing murder may not be as shocking and unthinkable as it was forty years ago, and that may be true; but the elegant and lightly style in which the gruesome murders and rapes are described by Alex makes the novel shocking and compelling still, and the moral and philosophical questions it raises about free will - essentially, is good truly good only when it's chosen? - or, is good behavior that isn't chosen by one's own free will better than bad behavior that is? - still fascinate. Burgess suggests no easy answers - but he raises some damn interesting questions, that may become more and more relevant. <br /> <br />The linguistic aspect of the book is also a fascinating one. Burgess came up with a complete and structured slang to be used by the teenagers of his hypothetic future, composed mainly of words derived from Russian. Since the Humble Narrator himself speaks in that hybrid language even as he directs his words at the readers, it makes for both a challenging and a fascinating read. <br /> <br />The 21st and last chapter of A Clockwork Orange is an anomaly that almost every reviewer here referred to, and so shall I. The chapter was omitted from Kubrick's otherwise very faithful adaptation, as it was from the original American publication of the novel (the version which I first read). Quite frankly, I can see perfectly well why Burgess and Kubrick chose to drop it, because it's mostly anti-climatic and does not fit in well with the book's ideas, though it fits in very well with the structure of the novel and answers some questions left by the original twenty chapters (most of all, whatever happened to old Pete?). It's interesting enough to read though - even though I still consider it an afterthought and a separate section from the actual novel - it sheds a very different light in regard to Burgess's views on the matters discussed in the novel, and raises some very different questions than the original ending. Do try to find the version that includes this chapter, but read the first twenty chapters first and this one separately, and decide for yourself.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore is an unapologetically terrible person.  I am disgusted by his shameless exploitation of greif to sell a political message.  He is also unapologetically in love with himself, as evidenced by pulling this film from the Best Documentary category in hopes of winning a Best Picture Oscar. <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is a muddle, and the viewer is never entirely sure whether the film is accurate.  It also meanders from point to point haphazardly. <br /> <br />So why the four stars?  Because this is a fantastically entertaining movie.  I don't care how accurate Moore's research is, I don't care how self-indulgent the man is, and I don't care how overhyped this movie is.  It is still worth a watch, and is worth more than a little attention.  While Moore's politics are certainly exaggurated, his point is a valid one, and should be a caution to any concerned citizen.
B0000029GA|5.0|Let me first say that this album is the best hip hop album ever made. I don't want to hear, what about ALL Eyez On Me, ILLMATIC is the best. The reason why its the best is because if you can ask anyone who really listens to hip hop and I guarantee they know every song on this album. Nas brings probably the rawest flow and intelligent lyrics people have heard since the master RAkim. Thats why when NAS was in the underground rap scene, the first thing people were saying was hes the next RAkim. Every song has consistently great lyrics and the great ny beats to follow it. \\"NY State of Mind\\" is probably the best song on this album which was produced by legend DJ PRemier. But bottom line this is an untouchable and unskipable album. If Nas made another ILLMATIC(really unlikely) he would be the best MC ever.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I am still unsure of why this film has received so much hype.  Jude Law is pretty, Kidman is prissy, and Renee, well, she's there.  But none of them deliver in the acting department... and the cameos are nothing but self-indulgent.  Phillip Seymore-Hoffman is uncharacteristically uninspiring, and Jena Malone is downright awful. <br /> <br />The plot was written, I am convinced, by someone unfamiliar with Gone with the Wind, yet trying to create a modern reconstruction of the film.  It drags.  It meanders.  It loses focus more times than I can count.  And finally, when the beautiful lovers are finally united, after two hours of waiting, extraordinarily uninspiring sex breaks out, assassinating the sincerity and beauty of the characters otherwise undefiled relationship.  Wait.... what relationship?!  How long did Law's character know Kidman's?  There is absolutely no set up, no sympathy for their romance.  These are two people who aren't seen together on the screen for more than fifteen minutes!  How are we expected to believe they are so desperately in love with each other if there is no time devoted to establishing their relationship? <br /> <br />On the brighter side, the film is magnificently shot, with beautiful scenery and an extremely crisp cinematic style, and the scale is epic, but this simply does not pull the film from out of the rather deep hole it digs itself. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this film for anyone serious about good filmmaking or serious drematic stories.  The best I can do is say it's a nice looking chick-flick with a hundred different stars if you can't find anything better to watch.
B0007P3582|1.0|How can you guys give into this media hog?? He gets into a beef with The Game, which is an obvious publicity stunt, seeing as how they are now friends again THE DAY that album results are in. 1.14 million copies?? Where has our music industry gone?? He's not gangsta, like he says he is. He is what is wrong with Hip hop. He is such a hypocrite, telling Ja Rule to stop singing, when he sings the choruses of \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\". That's fine if you like his music, but if you ACTUALLY think that he is a real hardcore rapper, then there is something wrong. Hardcore gangsta rappers don't sing tacky double entendre HIP-POP songs like \\"Candyshop\\" (which is a complete rip-off of \\"Magik Stick\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" is a complete rip-off of \\"On Fire\\" by Lloyd Banks). Honestly, it's almost a nightmare that this overhyped, sugarcoated crap, by a hypocritical, egotistical rapper ACTUALLY sold 1.14 million, in it's first week. No offense to his fans but you guys have given into to a self-centered loser. (Buy the way, where were you 1.14 million people, when his actual gangsta CD \\"Guess Who's Back\\" came out??)

After having listened to it over twenty times (my sons school is quite a distance from our house)I'm amazed at how well its remained \\"listenable.\\"  The book is read by the author E.B.White and his voice gives great character to the writing.  We purchased the movie version after having listened to this CD and were quite disappointed.  E.B.White has so much wit and wisdom in this original Charlotte's Web that's missing in the movie.  There's no annoying background music on this CD and it doesn't need it--E.B. White could've had a second career as a narrator of children's books!  The 50th anniversary edition that we purchased has an interesting biography of the author read by George Plimpton which follows the narration by E.B. White.  We also own the unabridged CD version of Stuart Little which is nice too--but Charlotte's Web is the stronger work.
0064407667|4.0|Others that have compared the tone here to Roald Dahl aren't off the mark...this truly is a \\"bad beginning\\" for the wealthy young Beaudalaire's (ranging in age from 14 year old Violet to the trio's youngest Sonny an infant with a propensity, which here means \\"something she often does\\", to bite). This book follows them after their parents die in a fire and they are forced to live with their nearest relative, cruel actor Count Olaf, who forces them to do odious chores, share a single bed in a tiny, filthy room, and conspires to take their inheritance from them.<br /><br />First I'll review it from the parental side:<br /><br />You'll want to think about your child's maturity level before you get this for them. Some themes addressed include death in an awful manner (the kids learn almost immediately in the book that their parents' mansion has burnt to the ground and none of them escaped), shotgun weddings (the book's villainous relative, Count Olaf, schemes to get his hands on the Beaudalaire trust [which here does NOT mean \\"to believe that someone cares for your well-being\\" but instead \\"a way to set money aside for someone until they are older\\"] by means of fraudulent nuptials),being orphaned (a scary concept for younger readers to be sure) and alcohol (Count Olaf is portrayed as a drunkard).<br /><br />On the plus side, the book emphasizes themes of self-reliance (the children look to books for answers to enigmas troubling them), kids will like its gentle jabs at grownups (a local judge is so enamored of the prospect of being in a play that the actor Olaf is performing that she fails to see the dastardly undercurrent of it...I can't explain further without giving it away), and it also teaches kids larger vocabulary words (by means of the device I borrowed above. Snicket will introduce a longer word, follow it with \\"which here means\\" and the definition. A delightfully sneaky way to \\"teach\\" kids)<br /><br />As an adult reading it, there were several times events seemed implausible (the dingy surroundings the kids lived in with Olaf would never pass muster with any governmental agency) but overall it didn't insult. Some moments (obscure case law surrounding Olaf's plan to swindle the Beaudalaire's out of their trust) could conceivably still happen, were an ancient law forgotten enough to not be \\"updated\\" in some small burg.<br /><br />For the kids:<br /><br />I believe that they would be absolutely drawn in by the book's tone which continually emphasizes that they are dark, morose writings. The story is playful and clever enough that I'll admit I did not imagine how Violet would escape her possible fate NOR how it would end badly nonetheless for the Beaudalaires. (Note the subtitle and the excerpt...this is NOT a happily ever after tale). Kids should love it.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I'm reserving the 2nd book \\"Reptile Room\\" at my library.ings the kids lived in with Olaf would never pass muster with any governmental agency) but overall it didn't insult.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta is an amazing band, quite possibly the greatest group of musicians working today.  Their earlier work, the Tremulant EP and Deloused, feel a little safe compared to Frances the Mute.  The songs off of those two albums where still somewhat close to standard song lengths, and when percusive salsa wasn't ripping you out of a comfortable lumbering guitar solos they followded rather standard song construction. I think that it is irresponsable to look at Frances as having several songs or tracks.  The CD is one 77 minute opus begining to end and only has track listings to make it easier to understand and digest.  It lacks the easily acceptable and recognisable songs of their earlier albums, but this is a bold artistic decision who's brilliance is revealed in time.

B000060MWU|1.0|David Lynch sucks. His movies suck even more. He patches together a series of overly dramatic shots, some labored dialogue and a sprinkling of nudity and calls it art. His movies are merely an opportunity for him to wallow in his own self-aggrandizing `creativity'. Don't fall for the hype.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality I found in this film was the music. It was actually good, but it was good before it was added to this terrible movie.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Dissappointed by last summer's mediocre \\"Alien Vs. Predator?\\"   Then you may want to pick up this boxed set and remind yourself of how truly great the \\"Alien\\" movie franchise was before the Hollywood bean counters opted to resurrect this concept via the \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" route.    Believe all the hype you've heard or read about this boxed set.   Not only is it all it's cracked up to be but it's actually even better than that.   Between the set's nine(count 'em nine)discs there are enough featurettes, documentaries, shooting scripts, storyboards, photo galleries, and other extras to keep you busy not just for several hours but for several days.    In fact, I've read some reviews that claim that this boxed set is almost too much to take in. Don't believe that.  This definitely one case where there's no such thing as too much of a good thing.   If you take your time and peruse the set's offerings over several days you'll see that it literally offers a wealth of entertainment.    This set's best offerings are the special editions of each of the four Alien films.    Suprisingly, it's the special editions of \\"Alien 3\\" and \\"Alien 4\\" that prove to be the most interesting and fun to watch.   The \\"Alien\\" special edition received a much ballyhooed theatrical release in 2003.   While interesting to watch, the original theatrical release remains the stronger version.   The reincorporated deleted scenes don't add to the film's impact.   There is also the scene with a cocooned Dallas, that actually conflicts with the Alien Queen continuity that was established by \\"Aliens\\" and continued with the other two sequels and \\"Alien vs. Predator.\\"    As for the \\"Aliens\\" special edition, it's been available for years on laser disc and DVD and therefore offers nothing hardcore fans haven't seen before.    By contrast, the special edition of \\"Alien 3\\" emerges as a real revelation.   The added and reworked scenes result in a film that is vastly different and ultimately superior to what was shown in theaters.   The only downside is that, unlike Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and Jean-Pierre Junet, \\"Alien 3\\" helmer David Fincher didn't provide a commentary or participate in post-production interviews for this boxed set.    At least, we do get surprisingly candid interviews from actors and production staff associated with this flawed classic.  This allows us to see how this film was troubled almost from the very beginning.    The \\"Alien Resurrection\\" special edition is less of a revelation but is still noteworthy for alternate beginning and opening scenes.       All in all, this is quite possibly the best film franchise boxed set ever produced and is a must for Alien fans.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have never been a Green Day fan, and never thought I would be. Since I listened to \\"Dookie\\" years ago, I found little appeal in the style of music and simply gave the album away. During the days before this albums opening, I noted it's upcoming release and forgot about it. One day however, my friend sent me the song \\"American Idiot\\" and asked me to listen to it. On my end, I sighed, and accepted the file transfer just to make him happy, but I was aware he was a huge pop-punk fan with a narrow-mind and I had judged Green Day long ago. However when I opened the song, I was taken by surprise.  <br /> <br />Later, I got the whole album and was further impressed by many of the songs, mainly the 9 minute medlys. I am normally a huge fan of Classic Rock, 80's metal, Classical, Grunge, Blues, Jazz and some old punk like the Misfits, but even I found this album appealing and I would recommend it to anyone who has an open-mind and doesn't always look for negativity. Listen to what the music HAS to offer and don't always focus on what's missing. While this concept album may not be as deep and clever as \\"Pink Floyd - The Wall\\", it is still interesting. I must have developed a wider more diverse taste since \\"Dookie\\" because I can't seem to give a reason not to go out and buy this album now!
B0007TKH66|4.0|On September of 2001,the UPN network and Star Trek producer Rick Berman with writer/producer Brannon Braga introduced viewers to Enterprise (later renamed Star Trek Enterprise in season three).   This fifth live action series from the franchise took place a century before James T. Kirk's five year voyage of the original series.This series follows the pioneering voyage of the first warp five ship in the early days of Starfleet, before the formation of the United Federation of Planets.   The crew of the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula), consisted of the Vulcan liason/first officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Chief Engineer Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker III (The great Connor Trennier), British armory officer Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating),Communication Officer/ linguist Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), Helmsman Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), and Denoblian Chief Medical Officer Phlox (John Billingsly).   At first the series was sampled by Trekkers curious about the beginnings of the Federation,which wasn't adressed until the fourth and final season.Soon viewership dwindled by it's racy tone, disregard of continuity, the fact that NX-01 looked technologically advanced to Kirk's NCC-1701,the unnessesary \\"Temporal Cold War\\" and it's theme song which was a AOR pop song(!!!!).The stories felt prefunctuary as to appeal to a larger audience, which was the previous Star Trek Voyager's biggest flaw.   Aside from the shows fallabilities, the first season boasted great episodes in Broken Bow (the series pilot),  The Andorian Incident, Breaking the Ice, Cold Front, Dear Doctor, Shuttlepod One, and Shockwave (the season finale cliffhanger).   Unfortunately,Enterprise would be a troubled production whereas the declining interest of Trek, flawed stories of the earlier seasons, and bad ratings would lead to it's cancellation in season four.The latter two seasons would find the show discovering it's tone under the guidence of Executive Producer Manny Coto.   Season one may haveturned off some viewers spoiled by TNG and Voyager, but would later emerge as one of the best Trek shows  since DS9

B00006IU73|5.0|This review is being written after hundreds of spins, and yet I'm still not sure I can do this brilliant album justice describing it. There are so many details, nuances and little secrets hidden on this disc that I'd feel rather guilty if I fail to mention them in my review; then again, I don't think it's possible to cover all its depths in a single review. This really is one of those discs you need to buy, give time, study its lyrics, pay attention to the excellent production, clever songwriting and magnificent musicianship.<br /><br />Some Opeth fans think that ever since Steven Wilson has been producing Opeth albums they sound too much like Porcupine Tree in some aspects, especially recording techniques and stereo mixing-wise. Well, I'd like to point out that Wilson's collaboration with Opeth has certainly worked both ways; Steven Wilson has definitely absorbed some of their elements and seamlessly injected them in his own music with Porcupine Tree. This is, as many will agree, the heaviest Porcupine Tree album, and it shows right from the first track. \\"Blackest Eyes\\" perhaps contains the heaviest guitar riff Steven Wilson has ever played; it kicks in after the moody bass line a bit like a gigantic rock piece. The heavy approach is further developed on other tracks as well; on the longest song, \\"Gravity Eyelids\\", which begins really slowly with minimalist songwriting and tribal rhythms, there is a sudden shift of mood as Wilson plays this shuddering guitar riff (in the vein of Opeth) over Barbieri's experimental keyboard arrangement. It's the kind of riff you might hear on a Tool album, except that I'm not a Tool fan, but it works incredibly well here. Buy the album to hear this riff.<br /><br />Steven Wilson's partner in Blackfield, Aviv Geffen, appears on two tracks, one of them being the highly acclaimed number, \\"The Sound of Muzak\\". This is one of those songs that I could identify with right away, because of its challenging bass line and despairingly intense shifts of vocal melodies. Moreover, this tune is about the current state of the music industry and its lyrics are terribly ironic, which recall Devin Townsend's \\"Earth Day\\" to me.  John Wesley, who has toured extensively with Marillion in his career, also graces this album with additional guitars and vocals, and it's in your best interest to give his music a listen. The band's affinity to Pink Floyd is still evident on some other songs such as \\"Lips of Ashes\\" and \\"Prodigal\\". They are both outstanding works of songwriting, musicianship and vocals.<br /><br />There are also two instrumental pieces here. Actually \\".3\\" isn't entirely 'instrumental' as Wilson utters a few words, but other than that, it has no vocals. It sounds like this huge orchestra performing psychedelic prog; whilst, \\"Wedding Nails\\" is the band's testimony to creativity. New drummer Gavin Harrison rules this track as the song delves into stylistic changes, maintaining its moody and heavy edge throughout. I am utterly amazed at the band's musical performance; every prog band needs to listen to this track to understand it is possible to write long instrumental songs without being overtly technical. The slower songs add to the album's diversity. \\"Trains\\" is a wonderful song built around acoustic guitars that pick up near the end thanks to the majestic drumming,  \\"Heartattack in a Layby\\" and \\"Collapse the Light into Earth\\" both start with sparse piano notes and Wilson singing the most amazing vocal melodies you could imagine. His voice makes my soul cry; it's full of passion and intensity.<br /><br />\\"The Creator Has a Masterpiece\\" and \\"Strip the Soul\\" see the band going back to its new-found heaviness. They are among the most progressive songs of the album full of schizophrenic melodies, frenetic interplay, some electronics and echoed vocals. Colin Edwin's bass is so integral on these tracks that it's the bass that carries the song's speed. \\"Strip the Soul\\" encapsulates a sense of brutal beauty (hence the Opeth element, in my opinion) and another personal favourite of mine.<br /><br />I own the European edition of this album with a bonus disc containing three tracks and a video. The songs are as good as anything else Steven Wilson has written, so if you're a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, this version is highly recommended. I've been listening to this album since its release, and still give it regular spins.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|If you've never heard Night Wish before, think of this album as this: the Lord of the Rings trilogy was made the same way, but they decided to combine Howard Shore's epic symphonic, choir-filled score with a rock-opera emphasis, and turned them into a trilogy of musicals. <br />With an album on the scope and intensity of \\"Once,\\" which is pretty much nonexistent, just the sheer scope and epic power of emotion, the merits of the album alone are alone worth the highest score.  And since I have chosen to round the score upward, I will analyze the weaker aspects first. <br /> <br />One person once referred to Night Wish as the most consistent group out there, and that they most certainly are.  There's a problem, however, raised by this fact: in terms of melody (despite how extremely thankful for a group actually having some in today's music), Night Wish only has a handful of songs, if you use the same metaphor as to how there are only 7 kinds of stories in the world.  Beyond just the music style and Tarja's strong voice, one can tell that they're listening to Night Wish, even when it's a totally new song, and commonly I hear overtly strong similarities from one song to another similar one.  Not to say that I don't like the songs that resemble the past ones, as there are almost no Night Wish songs that I don't like, and a good chunk of my more favored ones blow my mind every time I listen to them.  I'm just saying that, while the \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" philosophy is all fine and grand when we're talking about music so incredible and intricate, I would just like to more commonly hear ones that stray off the medium. <br /> <br />Luckily, Once does contain more \\"break-off's\\" from this trend.  However, there are still some glaring issues.  Personally, I didn't think the lyrics made much sense in many of the songs this time around...it was like pure semi-rhyming poetry, with little purpose.  Another is that some songs, like \\"I Wish I Had An Angel\\" sound somewhat twisted.  And lastly, would Tuomas PLEASE STOP IT WITH THE BRIDGES IN WHICH ONE NOTE IS CONSTANTLY REPEATED!?!  The opening song \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" suffers from this, as there's a 30 second or so gap where there's almost no music, just a continuation of the beat and a guitar riff of primarily a single note.  My less favorite Night Wish songs, such as \\"Passion and the Opera\\" and \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" were put on my \\"less favored\\" list because this problem was stronger than usual. <br /> <br />Oh, and why is \\"Ghost Love Score,\\" the finest track on the album, that's up there with \\"The Beauty of the Beast,\\" not the finale?  It's long, the most epic and emotional, and it fades out beautifully, so why not end with that one? <br /> <br />However, I don't at all wish to bellyache about this album, as it is, overall, one of the finest album's I've ever heard.  'Once' is an album that can be judged as Nightwish's best, as well as their weakest in a sense, as it's different, and while it has glaring problems the other's didn't have so strongly, it's also their most complex, and their semi-symphonic nature has successfully gone fully symphonic.  \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" is a splendid rock song that's both catchy and a very good combination of rock and classical.  \\"Nemo\\" is an incredible song that starts and plays very well, and ends on a finale that's unequalled in any song in the history of music.  And \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is like a movie climax for the album, and is more than worthy of such a task.  \\"The Siren\\" has an amazing dual-climax done by Marco (who's gone from good to great).  \\"Planet Hell\\" is like a song straight from Hell, but isn't evil feeling; more like a depiction...like a musical painting.  And \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is an odd one, but is very impressive nonetheless, and it's Native American influence is strangely successful.  Overall, it's more than worth the money, and would make a welcome addition to anyone who likes emotion in music, and doesn't mistake swearing and talking about killing police as \\"emotion in music.\\" <br />Oh, and for the record, I will soon turn 23; so no, not every Night Wish fan is either mentally incompetent or under 14 years old, like some people who can't conceive art would say.

This album... no, this BAND has brought back what music was meant to be; an experience to be felt on more than just the conscious levels.  Tool is not meant to be simply &quot;listened to&quot;... although if you're shallow like so many other so-called &quot;music fans&quot; out there, I suppose you could simply &quot;listen&quot; to it... but Tool is a band that, if you let it, can encompass you and take your inner self on a trip like nothing you've ever been on.<br />You may not grasp Tool's message at first... but listen to it in the right mindframe(perhaps under the influence of a substance, if you're into that), and the message will become quite clear.  Don't expect anything... Tool isn't &quot;rock&quot;, it's not &quot;metal&quot;, and it's definately not &quot;nu-metal&quot;... Tool is Tool.<br />Do you wonder how the members of Tool can acomplish such amazing performances of skill in their music?  Let's just say it takes more than just physical practice... it's about mindframe.<br />You may not know it yet, but this is the music of the future.<BR>This is the music that will change the world...
B000002UAX|5.0|This is the Beatles album that has everything on it.  There's hard rock (Back In The USSR, Helter Skelter, Birthday to name a few), ballads (I Will and the STUNNING Julia) pop songs (Savoy Truffle, Bungalow Bill), and pretty much every other style imagineable.  The album isn't without it's faults (Don't Pass Me By is terrible...it's too bad Ringo couldn't have already written It Don't Come Easy and put it on this album instead), but for a double album it is amazing how well it works considering how adventerous it was. John Lennon's voice aches with sincerity on I'm So Tired, while Paul McCartney does some of his best rock'n'roll screaming on this record.  George Harrison, as he often had a way of doing, manages to steal the show with While My Guitar Gently Weeps...a song that gets better every time I hear it. Ringo's drumming is fiery and raw on this album, and his importance to the band is very evident. While Magical Mystery Tour is my personal favorite, this is a damn good, no frills (except at points) testament to the genius of the Beatles as individuals and as a group.

So if you've already got suckered into buying this cd and you're sorely disappointed with the product, here's my advice that will make that $15 worth it all: <br /> <br />Take this cd and case and place in the middle of your lawn or in your closest neighborhood park. Then, take a shotput and keep throwing it from approximately 20 ft. till you hit the target! Once you connect, your delight should well be worth that $15 you wasted on the cd.

If you like Mutter this CD will be right up your alley. The CD has a much different sound but is distinctly Rammstein. Buy this CD if you love Rammstein or if you've only heard of them.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This has to be the best movie I've ever seen and I'm 14.  Normally, a 14 year old would think a movie such as this is boring and really corny, but it's not.   <br /> <br />The movie was fabulous because the phantom was so hot, Christine could sing very beautifully, and there was never a dull moment.  I don't know how people can say that this movie is total crap because it's simply not.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Simple Plan is one of the hottest band in our current music world, if you know about music, then this is the disc that you want to buy, every single song in here is about teenagers who had problems, and in these songs they stand up to those people who bring us down all the time. Simple plan is an excellent band and I look forward for their next disc.
B000002KHH|5.0|Can you invent a genre of music on the strength of one chord? Black Sabbath did with the opening salvo on THE ultimate Sabbath song, \\"War Pigs\\". This song is one of the few that instantly define metal in all of its various configurations with power chords mixing with the sound of an air raid siren. It all started here folks with 'Paranoid' released several months after their equally chilling debut in the autumn of 1970. But wait, there's more! \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Iron Man\\" and 'Fairies Wear Boots\\", all became all-time heavy metal classics and proof that Sabbath started it all. 'Paranoid' the album is essential for two other lesser known tracks, \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Hand of Doom\\", the former, like \\"War Pigs\\" dealing with nuclear holocaust, the latter, an obvious reference to the evils of heroin. The 1970's was a new era and flower power was about to be demolished by the sound of unrelenting doom as subjects like acid trips, insanity, corrupt politicians and science fiction showed the new realities that the sixites generation would now embrace. Nobody on earth could create the skull crushing riffs of Iommi and Geezer Butler's supernatural lyrics fit in beautifully. Ozzy never sounded more like a maniac than he did at the ripe old age of 21. Bill Ward gets to flex his muscles on \\"Rat Salad\\", his \\"Moby Dick\\" if you will. If you love heavy metal, or are just learning about the music, then 'Paranoid' is a must have for your collection. It contains three of Sabbaths greatest dirges, including the immortal title track, some of the greatest three minutes in the history of rock. Sabbath would continue to assault the world throughout the rest of the decade but none of their later music would achieve such a cold place in metal lovers hearts than the sweet little ditties that make up an album of unparalleled brilliance and unfathomable menace.
B00004TH83|5.0|If you're all about the voice that still sounds human but has the emotions, power, stamina and above all beauty than you'll love her albums. Lar Fabian's voice a gift from God. And her determination, discipline and devotion is her gift back to Him.
B000002UB3|5.0|Superb Song writing skills along with classic songs is what make this such a great album <br /> <br />The beatles are not a boy band and if anyone calls them one they should be smacked. <br /> <br />my fav tracks.... <br /> <br />come together, something, oh darling, here comes the sun, shes so heavy
0552149519|5.0|This is a great book with lots of wonderful facts.  The only reason this book has gotten some bad reviews is due to  people who are too rigid to want to open their mind to anything new.  Is everything in this book true?  Probably not.  Is everything in any book completely true?  No.  Every book has its own perpective.  Dan Brown did a lot of research and put together an amazing book.  I find most of his ideas to be more believeable than things I've read anywhere else.  I can't wait for Langdon's next adventure.<br /><br />PS. If you haven't read Angels & Demons yet, run out and buy it right now.  It's as good, if not better, than The Da Vinci code.
B000001FTD|5.0|Possibly Anthrax best album , \\"Among the Living\\" shows hints of hardcore punk mixed with thrash metal delivering a mosh fest. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks... all of them <br /> <br />An essential for any thrash metal fan or hardcore punk fan that is willing to step up and go heavier.
B0002UOK04|5.0|At first, this album seemed to be just an impulse buy. When I had seen that Necrolord had done the cover art, I figured I couldn't go wrong, despite the fact that my instincts can be wrong. Not this time! This album has some of the best musicianship I have heard in years, maybe longer. Jari displays guitar work and songwriting that is second to none. The musicians he picked for this album, I mean, it sounds like they've been playing together forever(they probably have!) The time signatures are so unique and original. This is not your typical metal album.Do yourself a favor and get this album, if only for the songwriting, you will enjoy this CD from start to finish. This CD will be in my stereo for a while. A true masterpiece!
B0000028RR|1.0|Hypocritcal money hungry untalented garbage <br /> <br />oh yes, the people who claim to hate the system air on MTV and are signed by sony. this kinda of music only appeals to little 11 year olds who know nothing about the economy and government. <br /> <br />not only are the lyrics stupid, but the idea of mixing rap and rock is just awful. <br /> <br />the \\"singer\\" is one of the worsts of all time.  there is no particular guitar talent as for the rest of the band, THEY SUCK.
0446677450|3.0|As the daughter of \\"Rich Dad,\\" I always wondered why some of the people I met in college subsequently found themselves in poor situations once they entered the job field.  Or why they made the financial choices they made (which to me seemed obviously unwise).<br /><br />The part of this book that is definitely worth reading are the sections treating the difference in financial advice and perspective that most financially responsible wealthy parents impart to their children.  (Not all rich people know how to handle money.)<br /><br />Now that I have this information, it becomes obvious why so many people I know have made poor financial choices.  They just weren't *taught* otherwise.  Amazing.<br /><br />As for the other parts of this book...well, while some of the philosophy is intriguing, real estate speculation/prospecting isn't for everyone.  The message that you will make as much as you set out to make is the real point here.  If you really want it, and you make the real effort in the right direction to make it, it will be yours.
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|I consider myself to be a big fan of the Cube series.  I have seen all of the Cube movies and enjoyed them all.  However, I have enjoyed Cube Zero in a very different way than either of its predecessors.  Cube Zero is a completely new concept with the premise of the cube still serving as a framework to set up the plot.  Those viewers renting this movie with the hope of experiencing more cube-like action, where a team of helpless people try to decipher internal workings of a complicated death maze, could be rather disappointed.  Cube Zero is not really a story about finding a way out of a maze. Instead, it is a discourse on ideas of authority and obedience.  How far will an underling go taking orders from his superiors without conflicting with his own ideals?  Will you go out of your way to help a stranger by sacrificing your life?   <br /> <br />I guess the biggest downfall of Cube 0 is that now it has demystified the enigmatic Cube.  We still do not know everything about why Cube was invented and who has the final level of control but we do get enough to satiate our curiosity.  Part of the reason why the original Cube was so hard to forget was that it ended without explaining the purpose of the cube and why people were put into it.  Now we more or less know the answer.  If you are willing to give up the idea of cube being a mystery you might enjoy this movie.    <br />
B00004WG2X|1.0|All I can say is this adaptation is the most boring and lifeless adaptation of any book I have ever seen. I cant help but think that Lizzy could have done better than Rintoul's Darcy. Sorry but this one did not move me at all. Dont waste your money get the best one, Pride and Prejudice 1995 by Firth/Ehle.After watching the 1995 version I was inspired to read the book. <br />
0060930187|5.0|This is a great book written by a powerful talented young woman that tragically committed suicide at the prime of her life. Perhaps because she was born in the wrong century, or she could not deal with society's pressures during the 1950's, and that drove her mad. Esther is concerned about being accepted in social circles, what types of behavior are proper and preoccupied with being a virgin. We can only speculate. <br />No one torments himself or herself purposely for any apparent reason, nor do they choose to feel suicidal at times. No one really knows why, not even modern day psychiatrists. It is disturbing to call this book a \\"classic\\" (although it is) or compare it to Salinger's Holden Caufield (Catcher In The Rye is a great book too), when the Bell Jar is about a person's real pain and troubles. As a matter of fact, the not so great reviews The Bell Jar received after being published made her uneasier and more depressed, since it was compared to Salinger's work. <br />Esther feels asphyxiated in her own world, (The Bell Jar is a metaphor for feeling emotionally stifled and trapped) and her anxiety and depression too much to handle so she attempts suicide and ends up in a mental asylum. There she receives ECT therapy (there wasn't Prozac then not that it would have been any better), which probably did not help much (just like Hemingway).  <br />The Bell Jar is of a haunting theme, and not for everyone, it is about the dark and desperate nature of a descending spiral of perplexity, ambivalence, melancholy, and ultimately death. I disagree that this piece of work is about selfishness, I love this book, and its one of my favorites. <br />
078322799X|3.0|This movie has to have one of the scariest & creepiest covers I've seen, apart from the Critters movies. And Michael J Fox is so cute in it! Did anyone else keep expecting Christopher Lloyd to pop up as his character the Back To The Future series, Doc? Apparently, so did Michael J Fox, as he repeatedly blew his lines by calling John Astin's character \\"Doc\\". This movie was eventually chosen, after an hour long discussion about what film to pick from 500+ - you should try it sometime, it's really hard, especially when you don't have the same taste in movies!!!<br /><br />I'm not sure about Peter Jackson being involved in this. Everywhere I look at the moment, he seems to be involved in something, or making a remake of something, or releasing fantastic, action packed DVDs of films. (Why can't James Cameron get his finger out then?) I haven't seen Heavenly Creatures yet, although it looks quite good but strange. He has a small cameo in this, which was kindly pointed out to me, even though I was already halfway to figuring out the character looked kinda familiar. He plays the The bearded and pierced man who Frank bumps into a minute before the ghost of Ray knocks him down. The day that his cameo was shot, Jackson had to wear the heavy metal outfit (leather jacket, make up and a vast amount of piercings) the entire day. This happened to be the same day that the studio had invited the media to the set for publicity.<br /><br />There's quite a few references to other movies in this. A figurine depicting Elvis Presley is visible in Ray (Peter Dobson) and Lucy's bedroom. Dobson played Presley in Forrest Gump. The surname \\"Lynskey\\" is a reference to Melanie Lynskey, who starred in Heavenly Creatures, and also has a small role in this film. While Lucy is watching the video about Johnny Bartlet, a copy of Heavenly Creatures (also directed by Peter Jackson) is visible next to the bed.<br /><br />The Frighteners was not released in theaters in Tasmania, Australia. The Port Arthur massacre rather spookily mirrored the films content and as it happened not long before the films release it was not shown in Tasmania. It was subsequently on video however and it has been broadcast.<br /><br />This was originally planned as a \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" feature, but producer Robert Zemeckis liked the script so much, he decided it should stand on its own and not be part of a series.<br /><br />I have to say that if you like the movie Ghost, you'll love this, as I ended up with the giggles during a few funny scenes, particularly when the ghost turns up and tries to talk to his widow through Michael J Fox's character. This has the right blend of comedy & horror, while not taking itself too seriously, like the afore-mentioned film Ghost. There's a lot of combined stories thrown into the running time though, so it can be a little confusing, while you try to figure out the ending.<br /><br />I found a lot of the time I was finding Jake Busey's character looked very familiar, but I must have had Back To The Future on the brain, as I thought he was Biff!!! Fortunately, I was wrong. He is of course Gary Busey's son. That's why he looks so familiar. He still looks like Biff though.<br /><br />It wasn't as scary as I was expecting, and kinda started to drag a bit in the middle. But still worth a quick peek if you fancy Michael J Fox - and the movie of course.rthur massacre rather spookily mirrored the films content and as it happened not long before the films release it was not shown in Tasmania.

B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna's 2000 release with Music is amazing. The first track of the same name is a fun and crowd pleasing start and the album ends with the beautiful ballad of Gone. In between, the tracks are all very representational of Madonna's new transformation, which is especially evident through Nobody's Perfect and I Derserve It. Other personal favorites include the poetic Paradise (Not For Me) and the upbeat Amazing. Music is a great addition to anyone's CD collection.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna is great, great, great!!! <br /> <br />you will get a lot of listenging pleasure here.
B0000E64TR|1.0|I bought two copies of this SACD, both had glitches and would not play in my player correctly, be forewarned. I dont have any other problems with other SACDs so I assume it is in the production somewhere. They would lock up for no reason, this is right out of the box, both copies.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is one of the most talented and versatile singers of all time. <br /> <br />This set clearly proves that. <br /> <br /> <br />
0385493800|5.0|Excellent story line.  Very much enjoyed reading this book.
B000003TBP|5.0|Picture Rock, Pop, Heavy Metal, Blues, Country, Hip Hop, Soul, Folk and Dance. Now take all these genres and put them into one song. What you now have is Beck's trademark sound, and Odelay is his most accomplished album to date.
B0007P3582|5.0|I am sick of reading all of these reviews that are like \\"Listen to the first 30 seconds of each song, and you'll see why it is so whack!\\"  Well, idiot, that's your problem.  You're only listening to the first 30 seconds!  People also need to understand how classic \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" was.  Did Jay Z ever come out with another \\"Reasonable Doubt\\"?  Did Nas ever come out with another \\"Illmatic\\"?  The answer is no.  50 will probably not come out with another \\"Get Rich...\\" but we can't blame him for that.  \\"The Massacre\\" is still an awesome CD, and the new \\"Hate It or Love It\\" Remix is one of the best rap songs I have ever HEARD!  Don't front on 50 just because you're greedy for another classic; that's much easier said than done.
B00004XONN|3.0|Yes, I'll admit it: after Ok Computer my expectations for this album had risen so high, it was almost impossible for Radiohead to live up to them. And consequently Kid A didn't. <br /> <br />Several years later I totally dig the fact that they haven't made a second Ok COmputer, but istead moved on. Radiohead's strength has always been the fact that they're one (or more likely two or more) step(s) ahead of their followers. <br /> <br />So I applaude Radiohead for further exploring their possibilities and interests, and there's lots of brillance on Kid A. Songs like Everything in its right place and In limbo are absolute gems. Totally original, highly inspired and extremely powerfull. <br /> <br />Unfortunately there's also a good deal of mediocre stuff on Kid A, and a few genuine stinkers (Kid A, Treefingers). But, everything does actually sound like it's in its right place. The album is a coherent whole and that's always a plus, especially when a band is experimenting like Radiohead is. <br /> <br />Lyricly Kid A is far more abstract than all the previous Radiohead albums, and musicaly it's further away from the classic pop song, and classic structure. You won't find any verse/chorus/verse/chorus/solo/chorus kinda songs on this one. <br /> <br />So in the end I'd say Kid A is a decent album allright, just not the masterpiece I was expecting. It's flawed, but at the same time it's highly enjoyable.
0140288503|4.0|It's is an interesting book which captures the details of this unique battle.It was a case of military power totally misreading the ground realities nothwithstanding the bravery of the individual soldiers.However, one glaring fact that seemed to be not shown in the correct light is the crucial role Pakistani forces placed in the rescue operation.According to number of sources if the Pakistani military had not moved that quickly the number of casualties would have been much higher.Despite,not being in the picture of this operation Pakistani forces backed by Malaysian forces broke through all the road blocks to reach the trapped troops.Pakistan at time time was one of  the most sanctioned country by U.S and it was perhaps politically not correct to acknowledge the extraordinary role that Pakistan army played in the last stage of this epic battle.However, now with the rediscovered friendship between U.S and Pakistan a more true account should perhaps be brought forward.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I have come to understand that the songs on Amnesiac were recorded mostly during the recording of precessor Kid A. And that this album has been presented (and is regarded) as Radiohead's fifth studio album.     If this would have been an album of outtakes or rarities it would've been pretty godd, but as a studio album it fails miserably.    Things start of pretty damn great with Packed like sardines... followed by Pyramid Song; one of Radiohead's very best songs ever. For the first time they haven't moved on since the last album, but since it's still this good I wasn't worried yet. Things started to go downhill from there pretty fast.     The main problem with Amnesiac is that it's as incoherent as can be, and (maybe more importantly) some songs are irritating as hell. Take Pul/ revolving doors for example. It's just plain silly with its computer treated voice that names all kinds of doors. And then there's Hunting bears, wich is nothing more than a guitar line played over a couple of times. Add to that a superfluous version of Morning Bells, a song that's also featured on Kid A, and you have a couple of really annoying moments.    Don't get me wrong, there's also enough to make this a worthwile buy: Like spinning plates is absolute genius: it starts of backwards but slowly turns itself over, it's sonic creativity of the highest order.    So, as a studio album Amnesiac pretty much sucks, but if you listen to it as an album of outtakes it's pretty good.    I've given this 2 stars, because when it comes to Radiohead you just expect more, and at times it's a bit of an annoying album.
B0007P3582|4.0|I hate people who just skim through a album with out listening to it. I admit I did the same thing and didn't like the album at first, but after actually listening to it this album its kinda dope. So stop hatin on 50 and G-Unit cause they runnin the game right now
B00007LL7O|2.0|This is pretty much the biggest load of overrated crap i've heard I'm used to over the top bands like Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica, and Nightwish those are all good bands with solid songs but this.

B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD from Simple Plan is a great step towards becoming an established group.  Their songs are catchy, and mainly CLEAN.  Song writers feel more often now that using \\"dirty\\" language will sell their CD's.  Simple Plan does not use this language and it is appropriate to play infront of all ages.  \\"Welcome to my Life\\" is one of those songs that if you really listen to it, makes you think.  Many of their songs are catchy, but this song in particular can strike your buttons.  Along with \\"Promise\\" this CD has taken a drastic step forward from the whiney complaining teenager idea that people were giving them when they first became big, and I look to see steps forward.
B0007O38F8|4.0|I was almost dreading listing to the CD based on the horrible reviews.  This CD is good, not great like \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" but it is far better than most.  There is no way 50 could top \\"Get Rich...\\"  but even on a bad day 50 is the best rapper out there today, period.
B000060P79|4.0|For their first CD, these guys hit the nail on the head.  It had catchy songs and, even though they get a naggy teenager bad rep to them because of it, the younger generation connects well with it.  They sing to their peers, which should be every group.  This doesn't happen all over however and when groups decide to do so, they are chastized for it.  This is a CD that will hit all young generations, which will make them wanna continue to listen as they progress in time.  These songs make you think they will swear and use the language that wouldn't make acceptable for all audiences, however they stay clear of that, which is amazing for young groups to do.  In \\"Addicted\\" they go out of their way just to say \\"dick\\" in their song.  But even that is done in a way that isn't made dirty.  Complete respect for any group that can do that.
B000002LCI|5.0|Music for the Masses was one of the most groundbreaking events of it's musical era, not because it was experimental (many had done these things before), but because it was able to bring such experimentation to the mainstream (hence the title).  A \\"concept\\" album with a thematic unity much deeper than tempo or popiness, it was the the crowning achievement of the \\"bedroom album\\" that Depeche Mode always does best.   <br />The album is constructed like a sympony or an opera, moving from high to low, repeating musical and lyrical themes, exploring the tender and vunerable facets of love.  <br />The tragic results of such sucess was that subsequent experimentation was slowly eschewed for \\"pop\\" consitency. As with all golden eras in popular music, this album didn't suceed because it had an abundance of radio-friendly songs (\\"the catchy ones\\"), but because the album has an artistic and thematic unity that touched the listeners not only of it's generation, but subsequent ones as well.

Skillfully composed songs, combined with honest lyrics that anyone can identify with and haunting vocals that will send chills down your spine make Chariot and album you MUST add to your collection.  From the agony of \\"Just Friends\\" to the determined \\"I Don't Want to Be,\\" every song on this album will become your favorite. <br />For a more mellow feel, pop in the bonus disc, the acoustic \\"Stripped.\\"  This disc features a new addition, an excellent cover of Sam Cooke's \\"Change Is Gonna Come.\\"   <br />This album is worth every penny, DeGraw is an artist to watch.
B00003CXCT|4.0|OK -- I won't go so far as to say I want the original untouched versions of the trilogy -- just go back (if you can find a copy) and watch the originals -- FX have come miles (mostly thanks to Mr. Lucas) in the last 20 years and its painfully obvious how weak the technology was then, especially in the first one.   BUT -- some of the new additions to the trilogy just don't cut it. Mostly my problems lie with the \\"cute\\" additions that Lucas felt the need to make, such as the little robots taunting each other as Luke and company zip by in the speeder in A New Hope, or the totally unnecessary Max Rebo Band sequence in Return Of the Jedi. Lucas was obviously aiming these scenes at kids. Little little kids.   The film that the new additions actually work best in is, no surprise, Empire Strikes Back. The nuances of Cloud City and the extra scenes of the snow creature are wonderful and -- most importantly -- subtle. Not the \\"insert new scene here\\" look of A New Hope.   But all of that aside -- the films themselves are really good and very fun to watch, even after the 100th time. The bonus material here is great as well, with interviews with the majority of the cast and some neat outtakes that will make you laugh -- check out David Prowse's Vader dialogue and Peter Meyhew's Chewy dialogue. Great stuff!  Bottom line -- yeah some of the new CG stuff is annoying, but look at it this way -- atleast there ain't no Jar Jar Binks!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Pod Race good; Jar Jar Binks bad. Ewan MacGregor good; Jake Lloyd bad. Special effects good; acting bad. Lightsaber duels good; Anakin's virgin birth bad. Empire Strikes Back really good; The Phantom Menace really bad.

B0007MVXQG|5.0|On my first listen, I was hoping for a 2nd British Steel. <br />That will not happen. <br />This Disc has 6 songs that will forever by in my MP3 player, never to be deleted. 3 of the other four are excellent. <br />Loch Ness is just not a topic that should have been here...the song is well written, I just got bored with the lyrics. <br /> <br />As for the video, I was totally digging the live versions of the songs and then they break away to an interview...then another song and about half-way into it...interview.  PLAY THE SONG!!!!! <br />The last tour was fabulous, the band was energized and they played nothing but classic PRIEST.  Produce a DVD of this entire playlist and I will put down my $20.  I was greatly disappointed that they did not play the music then talk about it. <br /> <br />The DVD was a bonus, so if you are wanting to buy a concert dVD, this ain't it. <br /> <br />BUT-this is all about heavy JUDAS PRIEST and this CD works.  It grinds in there with the best of them.  As I said, nothing can replace British Steel, but this is better than ...live, Turbo, Ram it Down, Defenders of the Faith, Point of Entry [Rocka Rolla, Hero, Hero]and Stained Class.  It is right there with Hell Bent for Leather and Screaming for Vengeance. <br /> <br />If you want the best Priest album (that they never made) buy Halford Resurrection.  Much harder from start to finish.  But 'Angel' is Priest and I can't wait to hear: <br /> <br />\\"Friday night and the PRIEST IS BACK!!!\\"

You will actually be able to read this, in bed, without passing out within minutes.<br /><br />What sets this book apart from the typical techie \\"learn how to program X\\" book is the distinctive writing style and the liberal use of cartoon bubble text, clip art and corny lines.  Think of this as a Dummies book on steroids (it is twice as thick).  If you have a basic understanding of programming and would like to learn Java and Object Oriented Programming, this is a great read.  It is entertaining and easy to read without being overly dry.  It is NOT a reference book and if you already know OOP and Java you might prefer a standard O'Reilly tome.  Likewise, if you despise the Dummies and Idiots book series (from other publishers), then this book is not for you.<br /><br />While reading you should have scratch paper, pencil and maybe a computer to test the short programs on.  On every few pages you'll find sample exercises and mini games to help you learn syntax and the finer details.  Most of the time you will want to answer the questions to further your learning.<br /><br />The 2nd edition is new and improved with additional chapters and corrections.  I was slightly confused with the sparse instructions on installing and running your first class file but was able to figure it out using the web and tweaking the code.  Each night I look forward to the next chapter and am saddened by my 1 a.m. sleepy eyes getting in the way.<br /><br />I have been enjoying the whimsical nature of this book and appreciating its ability to teach a dry subject in an entertaining way.<br /><br />[...]

Why do record companies always want to mess with perfection?)<br /><br />I would recommend buying the non-remastered version.<br /><br />Zepplin IV<br /><br />Van Halen I<br /><br />Piece of Mind - Iron Maiden<br /><br />Black Sabbath Paranoid<br /><br />Judas Priest British Steel<br /><br />AC/DC Back in Black<br /><br />If these six CDs are not in your collection, you are wasting precious moments on Earth.  Buy them now.
0596007124|5.0|If you want to learn design patterns, read this book first. It has the most clear discussion of design patterns I have ever seen. The technical material is presented with true wit and sarcasim, which makes this book hard to put down. It also has a good dose of general practical advice for object oriented design. If you are thinking about buying the \\"GoF\\" patterns book, I would buy this one as well and use it along side the GoF book. Or read this book first and then tackle the GoF book.
B00006JSS8|4.0|This is a wonderful c.d. but the man had so many great hits there is just no way that you can fit them all on one c.d. so I was a little upset to find out some of my favorites were not included
0618001905|4.0|This is an account of the Congo's history. It covers in quite vivid detail the lives of the players and the played who went into the capture of, the taking of, and the liberation of the Congo. King Leopold 2 of Belgium, several Americans, and a certian explorer whose reputation was well entwined with this privately owned colony. Not for those with weak stomachs. In my opinion this proves that Leopold was perhaps the greatest conartist and despot of his time.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The entire CD is amazingly solid...something I never would have been able to imagine Green Day being able to create back when they first hit mainstream.  But \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" has to be one of the most incredible songs I've ever heard.  No matter where I am when I hear it, it seems to fit...for now at least.  It's a song I know my kids will love when they dig it out of my collection some twenty years from now.  Definitely a keeper.
B0007NFL18|1.0|<br />Are you kidding me? 50 Cent delayed this record because he didnt like the way it came out and its still garbage. This is the worst CD I own 22 Tracks and there are only 3 songs worth listening to if you arent already sick of hearing them in the clubs This is really bad, I want my money back...! All this time waiting what a disapoointment... What happened?
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blonide might not be the Stones or the Beatles but they produced punky classics that have an endless shelf life. This is timeless. If you like American alt-music, Blondie is always with you in everything you hear. That's how big their influence was. Reconnect with this timeless band now. It's never too late to listen to great music. And this is great.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I don't know what all these critics were thinking--this is a great album and pure Priest.  Let's face it:  they were never the most sophisticated metal band and lived off good singing by Halford and good riffs.  I think this album is actually a lot better than some of the oldies but goodies.  Most tracks are well done or at the very least good sing-along tunes.  I also liked the ballad (\\"Angel\\").  The long track \\"Loch Ness\\" got a little bit out of hand there (and speaking of lyrics--cheese), but nothing to really be embarrassed about.  Anyway--the wait was worth it.
B000002X7V|5.0|I would just like to second everything the first reviewer has said. He knows what he's talking about. Jaccottet remains silent and allows Bach to speak. And he does. Highly recommended.
B00005J6RE|5.0|The Ultimate Computer <br />Approaching a Starfleet space station, the Enterprise receives orders to test a new computer system. The M-5 multitronic unit, created by foremost computer scientist Dr. Richard Daystrom, is the next evolution in vessel operation and control. The M-5 can operate a starship with a limited number of crew members, a fact that Kirk can't believe. The machine will be tested in vessel maneuvers, routine contact problems, and war game exercises against a task force commanded by veteran ship commander, Commodore Robert Wesley. With the majority of the Enterprise crew on the space station the ship gets underway with a crew of twenty. <br /> <br />Kirk, who thinks that having a single computer run a starship is dangerous, reluctantly goes along with the tests; at first all goes well. The M-5 performs everything asked of it with smooth precision. Various ship maneuvers and landing party decisions for a planetary survey mission are handled by the M-5 with the professionalism and experience of a veteran starship crew. Kirk uneasily watches on as the M-5 handles all the things he has trained his entire life to do. His frustration is further fueled after he witnesses his ship under control of the M-5 reacting to an unscheduled attack drill. The USS Lexington under the command of Commodore Wesley and the USS Excalibur under the command of Captain Harris are outmaneuvered by the M-5 unit and have multiple \\"hits\\" scored against them. <br /> <br />Kirk's uneasiness is justified when the M-5 destroys the SS Woden, an automated ore freighter. Kirk orders the Enterprise back to the space station and the M-5 to be taken off-line. The M-5 has ideas of its own as the machine, which has protected itself with a force field, kills an engineer trying to disconnect it while drawing more power. With the main attack force for the war games on the way, Spock and Scotty attempt to bypass the M-5, and Kirk and McCoy try to delve into Daystrom himself. In his early twenties, Dr. Richard Daystrom won awards and accolades for his duotronic breakthrough. The Enterprise and her sister ships in Starfleet utilize the duotronic computer systems created by Daystrom. That triumph in Daystrom's career was about a quarter of a century ago and the M-5 unit was to be his comeback. <br /> <br />The M-5 unit shows what a superior system it really is when it fools Scotty and Spock, thwarting their attempt to regain control of the ship. The machine that was impressed with Daystrom's personality to make it more suited to starship control seems invincible and there seems to be no hope for the approaching task force. Kirk's fears are brought to reality when the M-5 opens fire on the unshielded task force with weapons at full power. The machine launches devastating attacks against the task force comprising of the USS Lexington, Excalibur, Potemkin and Hood. The starships were damaged in the unprovoked and calculated M-5 attack pattern. The M-5 renders the Excalibur severely crippled, killing the crew aboard. Kirk desperately has Daystrom try and talk some \\"sense\\" into his creation only to find the doctor an unstable man who is proud of what his \\"child\\" has done. Wesley receives permission from Starfleet to stop the Enterprise at all costs with the remaining ships at his command. Trying one final gambit Kirk attempts to convince the M-5 that it has committed murder. The machine using the right and wrong lessons that were programmed into it deactivates itself leaving the ship open to attack. The Enterprise's shields drop, and when the task force goes in for the kill Wesley breaks off the attack at the last second. <br /> <br />Great space battles as the Enterprise tests the M-5 unit.  I guess they figured if the M-5 could survive Kirk then it was ready for mass production and use! <br />
B00020HEL6|5.0|I first heard this young girl sing briefly on one of the episodes of her CBS sitcom, \\"Still Standing.\\"  I knew something was up if they included it in the storyline, but then I saw her on Oprah when she was featured as a \\"find\\" of David Foster's -- the man who brought us the incredible Josh Groban.  I got this CD last week, and I am already addicted to her voice and her style.  If I remember correctly, she was 13 when this one was produced (2004).  It features some big band sounds, Melissa Manchester, and Gershwin -- all of which will always be great stuff.  For the younger buyers, you will notice a touch of Norah Jones, but when you hear the entire list of selections, you will realize she is her own unique artist.  I can't imagine where you go when you're this good in your early teens!
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|The two things about being a Marillion fan in America are 1) you'll never hear Marillion on the radio because 2) nobody over here has heard of them. Sure, you might find someone who vaguely remembers Kayleigh, but \\"that was years ago... are they still around?\\" So when a new Marillion album comes out, and it is a double album, who can a U.S. fan rave to, other than internet people? And now that you are listening, let me direct you to [...] where you can read more about this disturbingly brilliant album, Marbles. Before you go, though, bear in mind that Marbles shines darkly, with thick music and harrowing vocals by a band that has everything to lose at this phase of their career and yet dives boldly into any musical territory their muse takes them. <br /> <br />This 2CD set takes on a variety of styles, pulls them all off, and sounds like nothing you've heard before, in a sort of déja vu way. Marillion is one of the finest, truest bands at large, and they cannot get on the radio because they play Marillion music, not radio fashion. Marbles is a double-cd, non-concept album (think Physical Graffiti, where the band did what they wanted to and made it all so good) that sounded considerably death-defying when they toured last year. Steve Hogarth's vocals are in finest form, and will make your heart ache during the final choruses of leading track, The Invisible Man. Steve Rothery's guitar smashes like a hurricane should during the 18-minute \\"Ocean Cloud\\", and Ian Mosley's drumming is plain perfect all over Marbles. Mark Kelly continuing experiments with new sounds on his keyboards keeps the band enveloped in beauteous atmospheric sheeting, and Pete Trewavas, the working man's thinking bassist, is a steady heartbeat anchoring the listener in this world while visiting the fantastic, dangerous places of Marbles... places where love and death and loss and hope dance and drift and dream. This is one of those albums that sounds great on the stereo, but becomes downright remarkable on headphones. This is a piece of art, nothing disposable about it. Hardcore fans might try to compare it to previous Marillion albums, but that is such a terrible way to go about hearing anything by a band who truly feels \\"it.\\" Marbles will steal your breath away...just listen.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am an accountant with many responsibilities at work and at home. I am not a crank. I am sane, normal person. Also, while I sometimes practice mediatation and sometimes go to Church, I am not what you would call a religious person. <br /> <br />Last Saturday, I finally sat down to watch this movie after much prodding by my best friend. She explained that she had been involved with a mediation group that brought up this movie and its various sorts of religious significance. She and I got into a conversation about the power of art, meditation, buddhism, christianity, tibet, native american religions. The works. <br /> <br />So I am watching the movie and I feel like I am being hit by a mack truck. I don't even know why. It just hits me suddenly. This is a very spiritual film. I don't know if it's the music, the love story or all the allusions most of which my friend later explained I didn't even catch. I felt like I melted into a larger story. Not a movie but truth, beauty, freedom and love. That may sound crazy. But it came to me in a dream that I should share my experience with others. What a better way than here.  <br /> <br />Saying \\"rent this\\" does not do it justice. Words fail me. <br /> <br />
B000068PQ0|4.0|The positive reviews for this album seem to be coming from positive people while the anger just seethes from the negative reviews. So I thought I'd be original since I'm not usually a very positive person (what with all the strife and the world and all) but I really dig this album! I like Transmissions from a Satellite Heart, Clouds Taste Metallic, Priest Driven Ambulence, and Soft Bulletin, but Yoshimi's my favorite. I'm a professional jazz pianist and music is music- it doesn't matter whether it's made by an instrument or a tool. And this album will make your day, baby!
B000002I2M|5.0|This record is what blues is all about. Pure poetry. It takes someone a quite very few listenings while untill he gets to totaly comprehend and enjoy the Doors' 6th album which is music at it's finest and I might add I am one of them who do choose this 6th Doors' record to play more oftenly on a mp3 CD player than the previous 5. There are 10 songs on this record. <br /> <br />The Changeling. The one who had money, and then had none, and never felt so broke that he couldn't leave town... he is called the changeling... is the song Morrison wrote before he moved to Paris. This song tells a rather simple existencialistic story and could be one of those slice of life everyone's blues.  <br /> <br />Love her madly. Plain briliant melody. Probably Krieger's best recording and Densomore's averagest one. A hit record. <br /> <br />Been down so long. A long and slow poor prisoner blues song. Pure magic. <br /> <br />Cars hiss by my window. Anoter blues lament song, this time about a man who is waiting for his baby behind a window where vocal and drums are making dark and rainy atmosphere.  <br /> <br />L.A. Woman. The title piece. Pure rock'n'roll. The best. <br /> <br />L'America. Poprock mixed with blues that sounds like a pink floydish improvisation that works out well. A song about a trader and his american travels.  <br /> <br />Hyacinth house. Some rambler gambler blues. Beautifoul song. <br /> <br />Crawling king snake. This song features the man also known as The king of lizards, the snakeskin man, the whiskey drained voice singer. The lyrics have AAB blues form again. <br /> <br />The Wasp. Great poem about Texas radio. And the big beat. <br /> <br />Riders on the storm. A classic from Los Angeles. Perfect Manzarek's keyboards. By some coincidence, the last song the Doors made is also their best known and radio's most played piece. <br /> <br />L.A. Woman is the most cool and serious sounding work. Maybe this is due to a fact that this record is the most slow one. Arrangement on this record returns to the roots, there is not much other than 5 musicians here and the band also finally gets a cool bass player for their last record as a whole group besides An American prayer, the last Doors' record from 1978.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|JP's Angel of Retribution makes me think that it's as if Rob never left the band; they've certainly picked up right where they left off. I don't want to regurgitate what everyone else has been saying, but I must agree that this is classic Priest all the way- the power, the energy, the glory that is classic JP is all there. I was afraid  that (like so many other older rock bands that seem to be selling out to the younger crowd) there would be some signs of \\"nu metal\\" in there. But, much to my relief, they are staying true to the sound that brought them the name that they acquired for themselves more than 30 years ago- true power metal that so many bands can only hope to live up to. Burnin' all the way!!!
B000002I2G|4.0|THE SOFT PARADE is the 4th out of 7 of the esencial Doors' albums one should own, but short and eclectical. The best part is that timeles horns pompous opening in the 1st song, following by superb arangements in the 2nd pop rockish song also best heard on right stereo chanell only, but even better part is the continuation of this product. It's the part where Morisons' lyrics begin.  <br /> <br />Shaman's blues is just an intro, an insight of 1969 Morison's jubberish american-indian inspired political philosophy rap, to be followed by real gems.  <br /> <br />Do it. \\"ahhaaha yeah please please me\\"... doesn't that beginning of a 4th song remind you of the most influential record of all times the Beatles' first? This piece is a short simphony in it's 3 minute form, while lyrics are a simple chant that you'd feel Doors have stolen from somewhere...?  <br /> <br />Easy ride. Now this song is the real thing, this song is a wild west at it's best, it is the fastest country & western boogie tempo Doors ever made, wonder where they copied this one from.., a film Easy Rider?  <br /> <br />Wild child. Another Doors at their best studio jam sessions acompanied with Jim singing Elvis-like religious philosophy inspired style here. Thrughout this album a number of songs is like so many times Doors have, displayed all, rock'n'roll, waltz, march, boogie, foxtrot and indian moon dance.  <br /> <br />Runnin' blue. Poor Otis, dead and gone, and now the Doors will bring a jazz big band and a country band, acompany it with Ray's organs, studio bass player, and play soul music for their wifes in red dresses making one of the most unusual funny rock song of all times. What a cool idea.  <br /> <br />Wishfull, sinful. And the title song... a surreal finale. Too bad there's just 9 songs here.
0806930152|5.0|What's not to like? This is pure, old school, functioning anatomy and it is so simply explained that for the better part of a century this instructor's lessons have been in use and his books have stayed in print. When I was too young to listen I passed on these lessons, and then Frank Frazetta told me the secret to good anaotomy was contained in the books by George Bridgman. So, I took a second look.... and I've never regretted it. First I bought the very inexpensive Dover editions. Then when I saw the large hardback edition of the book featured on this page I didn't hesitate to buy it. I still use it from time to time and when instructing people in anatomy I always refer to this book first. The human machine concept makes learning anatomy very easy, from its pragmatic lessons on the function of human form to its spare, hands-on eloquence which reflects classical form. Besides all that, this is a very affordable book that no student of life drawing should be without. It's the book to make room on your shelf for, but don't pack it in too tightly. Good reference books like this one require easy removal to make its lessons easy for repeated access.
0316666343|4.0|I thought the the book called the Lovley Bones was the most interesting book that i have ever read in a long time. Don't get me wrong there were some parts in the book that were a little boring but overall this book was filled with a warm hearted good topic to talk about. The best thing about this book is that it caught my attention when i first read the first page. I suggest everyone should read this wonderful book.
B0000025RI|5.0|Thriller is no doubt the best MJ album, <br />and one of the best pop album of all time, <br />I'm sure no one can make a classic like Thriller again! <br /> <br />All songs in this album is above Great, <br />Few classic with tons of Excellent Tunes! <br /> <br />Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' - Very Great Song! <br />A Fast Tempo song with simple but catchy chorus, <br />a club banga! 5/5 <br /> <br />Baby Be Mine - MJ sing so well in this song! <br />A Very Catchy mid tmepo song! 5/5 <br /> <br />The Girl is Mine - A slow love song feat/ Paul McCartney! <br />A Very Catchy Romance tunes! 5/5 <br /> <br />Thriller - Who will forget it's video? <br />MJ turn to Zombie, <br />His CLASSIC Jacket, <br />Classic Move Classic dance! <br />I'll never forget! <br />Thriller is one of MJ most famous song, <br />A well Known Classic!  <br /> <br />Beat It - MJ ROCK HARD!  <br />Fast, Bangin' Beat!

B0007GAEW6|2.0|A few good songs here and there.  But it's way too hard to get past the pretensiousness.<br /><br />The formula: read Edgar Allen Poe, experiment with drugs (or even better get hooked), and get that fabulous herion shek look.  Then listen King Crimson, Yes, and various punk bands.  Then take any idea that pops to mind like it is the greatest insight ever and everyone else is too stupid to figure out; then voala- you have something totally pretentious and abnoxious.<br /><br />Some folks will write reviews about how this music has the mark of genius!  Then you'll believe your hype so much that you will make albums that get worse and worse but it will be masked by with obsurd explainations of how its over everyones heads.<br /><br />This is a talented band that needs to edit their songs and stop emualating old ones.
B000084T18|1.0|50-cent sucks. He just plain sucks. Classical music is better than this junk. rap is bad no matter who's singing. 50-cent is a gay over shot loser who has other people create songs for him to sing and get rich off of, while the designer of the song get 5%. all rap is the same. People just sing blurred words, that would rhyme if you could hear them. Nothing special. In contrast, a rock band actually plays an instrument and sings words you can hear, understand, and sing along to. if you want good music buy a Green Day or U2 CD. It's just my opinion but, I'M RIGHT! 50-CENT SUCKS.                         3 reasons why you should not buy this CD:    1. 50-cent is isn't talented, he doesn't play an instrument.  2. 50-cent is hated so much that hes been shot 9 times.  3. He raps so bad he needs to play his backround music louder than his voice so that nobody can hear his voice.    I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS CD.
B0007MVXQG|3.0|Here it is,the most anticipated metal album in years,and guess what? I give it maybe a Seven!!! I've been a Metalhead for over 25 years and I must say even though this is not a bad album,it's disappointing for Priest standards.Who in the world produced this record? The sound is horrible!!!! I just listened to the British Steel album,which came out in like 1980 I believe and it sounded a 100 times better! The songs on the new album aren't really that bad though,especially Judas Rising,Demonizer and my favorite Hellrider,all good stuff,but,man,it sounds like they mixed all the instruments and put them into a Grinder (now,there's a classic Priest song right there).The snare drum is almost none existing,the cymbals sound like crap,yes the double basskick is the only thing that stands out here.Even the guitars are not as heavy,what's going on guys? When you listen to earlier Judas Priest records you can feel the raw energy,the stuff that makes you wanna raise your fist and bang your head furiously,but not with this one folks.It seems like more of a retrospective of their 30 year career rather than a good headbanging metal album.Hey,nothing wrong with ballads either,but it just doesn't really click on this album.I'd like to give credit to Rob Halford though,he's still one of the greatest screamers of all time,and he's not holding back on this one either,ok,maybe just a little bit.Ok,here's my advice,go get the new album,if you're a diehard priest fan,but don't expect Screaming for vengeance or Defenders,etc.it's more like Painkiller meets Rocka rolla and somewhere in between.And one last thing,please guys,work one the sound,this is metal music after all!!!!!!
B000002UZ4|5.0|Ah, the Pet Shop Boys. That band that everybody loves to hate...but actually just hates to love. After all, there was no better way to lose the respect of your peers back in the day than to admit you were a fan. But what's REALLY interesting is just how many Pet Shop Boys 'haters' admit now (at 30+ years of age, that is) that they liked the band all along! Those smart, catchy, danceable tunes are just SOOO irresistable that even the head-banging crowd listened to them when nobody was watching! So should you buy this CD? It all depends. Perhaps you already have all the albums, in which case it would be pointless to do so. Or maybe you want to go out and buy them anyways. But if you just want one Pet Shop Boys CD, this is by far the best one to get! After all, it has most of their great, older songs. Yes, it may be missing some of them. But what do you expect from a compilation? If anything, you might want to go on to buy more of their CDs. Hey, worse things can happen. And regardless, I won't tell anyone!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Stephen Schwarts DOES IT AGAIN! First Pocohantas now Wicked. The casting is great and the songs in the CD defy your wildest dreams of what \\"Wicked\\" really is. This rock musical is played and presented with such taste and harmony. Schwartz must have a knack for extremly powerful, driving, and influential music. He also includes a tastful sense of humor to the music. Chenoweth and Menzel are spectacular fits for this score. It is so dazzeling, music that will make you break out in tears, the voices are so crisp and dareing. Truly, Truly, Truly amazing!
B00004I9VE|5.0|Over 50 million copies sold all over the world. <br />The #1 album of all time. <br /> <br />\\"Thriller\\" is truly deserving of joining the list of the \\"best albums of all time\\" history. Add it to \\"Led Zepplin IV\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\", and \\"Synchronicity\\". <br /> <br />The variety of music, the state of the art technology, the soulful voice of Michael, and the ability to play the album start to finish are some of the reasons this album is awesome. <br /> <br />Seven of the nine tracks hit the top ten, two hit number one (\\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\", two of the classic songs of all time). The other two that weren't released as singles(\\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady in my Life) are just as strong as the other seven. Not one song even close to filer status. <br /> <br />The music appeals to all ages, races, genders, social levels, income levels, etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br />The music appeals to all music genres: rock, pop, R&B, dance, jazz, etc. Unbelievable <br /> <br />He might be a little kooky in his lifestyle, but in his music, Jackson is a genius never before witnessed.  <br /> <br />\\"Thriller\\" is the invention of musical greatness exposed. Pick it up TODAY!
B00004XMV6|1.0|Mickey Rourke and Kim Bassinger are caught in the spider's web of a sado-masochistic affair. There isn't very much going on in the movie except a string of highly charged and seamy sex scenes. On the whole, the movie adds up to a big zero.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Ok, Quentin Tarantino has made some decent and blood infested movies in the past that actually passed off as good movie watching (not in my eyes-but in the Tarantino-ites' eyes). However this was actually the first Tarantino film I sat through and believe me it will be the last. <br />I was told that this was a great film with an interesting story and a unique use of music and fighting (I like watching women kick ass). The only thing unique about this movie (and like KB vol 2) was \\"THE END\\". I was waiting for the story to make sense, the plot to begin and the cheesy, corny and inane stuff to stop. For example: we are not allow to hear Uma Thurman's character's name until the second movie (he actually beeped out her name in the first one-WHY).  <br />Then there was the over usage of gore/blood/violence. Apparently Mr Tarantino has a fetish with blood (see all movies done by Tarantino). I don't think, in his career, he could make one movie without using blood.  <br />Now, Uma Thurman. She is indeed a beautiful woman. However, a martial artist she is not. She acted very plastic like and had movements like she was programmed to. As Lucy Liu said to her in the movie: \\"White girl thinks she can fight like a samari\\" (not verbatim-sorry).  <br />As I sat watching this gore infested, so called \\"great film by many critics\\", I was wondering \\"Why the heck am I watching this?\\" Apparently I was tricked into watching this. All I know is I would not have spent the $$$ to watch it in the theater. I, more than likely, would have walked out.  <br />The movie moved like a video game (like Gauntlet Dark Legacy). Each level has a \\"sub boss\\" before you can face the ultimate boss (in this case Bill and Lucy Liu, etc).  <br />As for the music, I was disgusted with the music. It had no reason/relivance to the story. I was sitting there when the music would blare on and think: \\"Huh, ok. Why in this spot in the movie?\\" The music was overbearing and over the top (as is Quentin). <br />I am alsowondering why so many critics praise him. Why do so many of them think he is a cinematic genius? The only thing I can think of is that he either bullies them into declaring his movies the greatest since Adam or he buys them off.  <br />Well for whatever reason, I am certainly not a fan of Kill Bill vol 1 or 2 nor am I a fan of Mr Tarantino. <br />
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is simply the most enjoyable movie I've ever seen, bar none. The setting is Rick's Cafe in Casablanca at the beginning of WW II. Everyone here wants out of Casablanca, except Rick (Bogart), who has escaped here from Paris and the woman he's loved and who's jilted him. He is cynical, interested only in himself. Then one day Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), his lost love, shows up, in the company of husband vc xVicor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a great Resistance leader. They, too, want to escape to America, but the Nazis plan on stopping him. Through an accident Rick has the only means of getting them out: letters of transit that cannot be rescinded. It's Rick's conscience versus an old love wound; there is some doubt which will win (even when making the movie this doubt remained right up to the final days of shooting), and at what cost.<br /><br />Everything works perfectly in this movie--the cynicism, the idealism, the twists and turns toward the conclusion. Bogart is at his tough-guy-on-the-outside-softy-on-the-inside best; Bergman is lovely; Claude Rains as the police commissioner is witty and almost as cynical as Rick; Sidney Greenstreet is great in a minor role. This movie never fails, no matter how many times viewed. Wonderful!
B0006SSOHC|2.0|When the credits rolled at the end of Saw, I almost laughed at how  preposterous and desperate this movie is. There are so many disconnects in logic and narrative throughout this movie but they are only apparent in retrospect, when the movie ends and you are shown what was \\"really\\" going on. First of all, the villain is first seen as an incapacitated patient with an inoperable brain tumor, but we are expected to believe that he can find the time, money and energy to organize and engineer the monumentally complicated traps in which he places his victims. And, no, you can't fake the neurological, opthalmological and laboratory manifestations of a brain tumor, and you sure as hell can't fake a massive brain tumor on your own MRI scan, so don't tell me this was all just part of the villain's plan. It's bogus and nonsensical. <br />I mentioned the complicated traps. I mean they are WAY complicated. Every detail, every contingency, every nuance has been anticipated and thought out to the ten thousandth degree. The planning, the execution, the timing, the physical construction of the settings for the traps..hell, it would take months if not a year to put all this together. It simply rings false. It is not believable, and this inability to believe and trust in the story contaminates the viewer's enjoyment of the film. Now we come to a plot device that the writers fall back on several times during Saw, the \\"slow acting poison.\\" We are asked repeatedly to believe that the characters are acting as they do because they believe they have ingested \\"slow acting poison.\\" They act completely irrationally, violently, and become all caught up in these mega-complex scenarios all because they believe they are dying from \\"slow-acting poison\\"? Doesn't anyone  go to the Emergency Room? Sorry, slow acting poison sounds like a lazy plot device from a second-rate high school play, not the engine that drives a major motion picture. <br />Now, let's talk about the acting. Bad. Embarrassingly, amateurishly bad. Sometimes, especially when the actor who plays the doctor is speaking, the acting literally struck me like a satire of bad acting. I half-expected him to wink at the camera. <br />Dammit, you may ask, why can't I just relax, suspend my critical faculties, and simply enjoy the movie for what it is, instead of condemn it for what it isn't? Here's why. This ain't that kind of movie. Yeah, when I watched the Exorcist, or the Omen, or the Shining, yes, those movies don't pretend that they are based in gritty reality and don't depend on our familiarity with serial killers, religious psychopaths and other wingnuts in order to obtain their scariness. This movie,like Seven, is grounded in the fact that the audience knows there are really creepy people in the world, and it is this connection with our own reality that is supposed to give the movie its power. Seven succeeded. This movie, however, fails. We can't suspend disbelief, like we do when we watch the Shining, but we are still jarred into disbelief by preposterous plot elements and wretched acting. The viewer is stuck, unable to believe, unable to suspend disbelief, waiting for the credits to roll. It's like drinking slow acting poison.
B000000OSO|5.0|Have always been an Aerosmith fan, even on their lp's that didn't do all that well. I can honestly say that 'Get A Grip' is a darn good later day effort by them Boston bad boys. I've heard a few mention how this CD just MAY be the band's best record since their 'Rocks' lp. Now, that's saying something. 'Get A Grip' is in my opinion anyway, a modern hard rock classic. Rips from beginning to end. Killer tracks include \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Shut Up And Dance\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Line-Up\\", \\"Livin' On The Edge\\" (remember the video?), \\"Cryin'\\" and \\"Walk On Down\\" (which features guitarist Joe Perry on vocals). Sweet! No doubt. A must have for all fans. Highly recommended.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|I am so sorry I watched this DVD. Or at least part of it, before I turned it off. I would warn any Metallica fan not to watch this film. It could easily turn you off of the band. I know it will be a while before I can listen to Metallica and not see the band draped over some sofas whining like spoiled teenagers. I guess part of the problem for me is my volcanic hatred of psychologists and psychology-speak. Everytime the psychologist was on camera, spouting his vapid tripe about the \\"zone\\" or some other garbage, I wanted to put my hands through the screen and choke his skinny little neck. And then the band falls for it and starts speaking in psychobabble, whining and bitching about all their little \\"issues\\". That is essentially what this movie is, a filmed record of interminable therapy sessions with the band. And these guys just aren't that interesting. James Hetfield is kind of a low-watt clod who prefers to communicate with grunts and smirks. Lars is a phenomenally self-absorbed, self-important jerk who fancies himself a true artiste. He comes across as a hyperactive, selfish little dick. And poor Kirk Hammett, probably one of the greatest living rock guitarists and a truly nice guy who just wants to play guitar and get along, but he literally has trouble putting a sentence together. Okay, so they are not Mother Teresa and not Albert Einstein. So what? Well, I just mention this because they are supposed to be a hard rocking, bad ass band. But they are revealed in this film to actually be a bunch of feuding, moaning, petulant crybaby pampered pussies. <br />God, watching these guys agonize over some little issue, goaded on by the omnipresent psychologist, you'd think being a multimillionaire, multiplatinum rock star was the hardest, most unfair job in the world.  <br />I suppose if you are just the biggest Metallica fan in the world, and if every single thing they do is of interest to you, then this film might be for you. For me, however, I don't know how I can listen to \\"Sad But True\\" or \\"Master of Puppets\\" again without thinking of these soft, pampered young millionaires and their smarmy psychologist, sitting in a therapy session mewling like hungry kittens. Maybe Metallica is like sausage. You can enjoy it as long as you don't look at it too closely. This DVD is a boring waste of time. Listen to music instead.
B0007O38F8|1.0|This pretentious collection of \\"made for radio\\" rap is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within.  The once thought provoking and lyrically adventerous rhymes of 50 Cent have yet to be found on this album.  Offered from the newcomer with fading potential are dirty lymerics of self indulging tripe, sexual deviance, and poor humor. The musical growth rate of 50 Cent cannot even be charted.  He is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.
0156027321|4.0|Throw away the slow, pendantic personal essays of part 1 and skip straight to the real story where part 2 starts!  The very idea of a boy stranded for 227 days in a lifeboat with a 450-pound tiger is objectively unreasonable, but you will find yourself believing it completely in short order!  An old plot, with predictable issues and scenarios associated with survival on the open seas, but with twists you will never expect.  This is a real page-turner once the story gets going.
B000005JA8|5.0|The greatest rock album EVER. If this doesn't change your life, it's not worth changing. Kill yourself now.
B000002UB3|4.0|I'll start by saying that I'm not the world's biggest Beatles fan.  I see this perspective as a good thing because it means I'm less inclined to become caught up in the hysteria that so often surrounds the Beatles' work.  I do like their later albums, though. Anyway, even though I don't  like all the songs on this album, it does have some truly brilliant moments.  The vast majority of the songs are beautifully crafted and that makes it easy to see why so many people regard this as the best Beatles album. I particularly like:    Come Together  I Want You (She's So Heavy)        Here Comes the Sun    The medley at the end (beginning with 'You Never Give me Your Money' is also beautiful and one of my favourite moments from the album.  Absolutely sublime!    For me, it's novelty songs like 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer', 'Octopus's Garden' and 'Her Majesty' that detract from the overall feel of the album.  They seem to be a bit incongruous to my ears when coupled with the truly great tracks on this album.  What's the point?  They don't seem to serve any purpose whatsoever.  Anyway, that's just my opinion.
B00000I2PG|5.0|This was my favourite album of all time in 1982. It's still my favourite album of all time in 2005. There is nothing to say about Lexicon that has not already been said by far more qualified reviewers and wordsmiths than little ol' me. <br /> <br />If you haven't had the pleasure of hearing this album then do so. You can always ebay it and be guaranteed to get back what you paid for it. 38 minutes of sheer class and brilliance.
B000000W5L|5.0|'Exile on Main Street' sounds as though it could have been recorded in a small, smoky club somewhere and the Stones sound like they're having a blast!  The songs cover a lot of ground -- from blues, to country, to rock, to gospel music -- and it all sounds very believable.   <br /> <br />You can hear the kind of musical diversity of which the band is really capable in this record.  This is the Rolling Stones at the height of their musical powers!  'Exile' doesn't contain many of the band's big hits but that doesn't detract from the charm. <br /> <br />Put this on and listen to the Rolling Stones get down and dirty!
0425170349|5.0|this book is better then the rainbow six games.<br />the plot i gripping from the prologue the hijacking of a plane to the ending sequencce where the bad guys suffer a most unpleasant death. yes it is a little bit long but the pages go buy rapdily especially when team rainbow is out in the field doing their stuff. the description and detail put into the weapons characters everything is amazing and i felt hatred towards the man in charage of the scheme. <br />tom did it again...
B0000ADY9I|5.0|This release manages to encompass everything the Allman Brothers Band was about: gutsy blues, superb musicianship and breathtakingly long jams.  Every lover of blues or 'Southern Rock' should buy this just so they can say it is in their collection.    PS: this release comes from the original guitar-heavy lineup, which still featured awesome guitarist Duane Allman.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|All that I can say is that the puppet sex scene is one of the funniest I have ever seen in a movie. Parker and Stone have single handedly managed to b!tch slap every political stance in the US today. They really let those humps in Hollywood have it. Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck finally get what they deserve!! The song about how \\"I need you more than Ben Affleck needs acting lessons.....\\" just radiates the truth. I also really liked the title song when all of the aircraft takes off. [...]I figured that this movie would be a Bush bashing fest, but I was pleasently surprised!! Don't worry though the take a few stabs at the current polical climate in the US. [...] The puppetry is completely absurd adding to the comedic effect of this movie. This movie is not as funny as South Park the movie, but it is still hilarious. Great job Matt and Trey!
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem Show is one of my fav. albums of all time, i like every song in this album. Eminem is a great rapper and i'd simply put him next to 2pac, Nas and Big. He matured a lot in this album and talks about things he never did before (eg. politics). <br />Every rap fan should have this album. <br />My fav. songs <br /> <br />Say goodbye holywood <br />Sing for the moment <br />Superman <br />Haily's song <br />Say what u say (dre is on fire) <br />Till i colapse <br /> <br /> <br />OUTLAW <br />
0812932293|5.0|I've always found Richard Branson to be a fascinating man from his strong business acumen to his perilous and well-documented adventures. That being said, when I picked up this book to read, I didn't expect to find it as intriguing as I did. Many business autobiographies that I have read tend to drag on and focus on the same old business philosophies.  Mr. Branson runs his business completely opposite to how we are told by most experts that a business should be run.  <br /> <br />Branson's passion and drive are infectious. His blatant disregard for the stuffy way business \\"gurus\\" say that businesses should be run is refreshing.  The many stories shared in this book are extremely interesting and fun to read.  I found myself unable to put this book down, which is saying a lot for me.  A very enjoyable read! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|3.0|My advice to you if you decide to buy this album: rip the tracks onto your hard drive, then delete tracks 3,4,5,6,8,12, and 13. You will then have a pretty decent album. In particular, Together and Nobody's Home are standouts. In any case this is certainly a weaker album than Let's Go. Whether that's because Avril took on more of the songwriting duties or some other reason I don't know. One positive note: the lyrics are a bit less juvenile.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What more can I say that hasn't been said already? It is truly a great show. I liked the little bit of it I saw on the TV, but now that I've seen the whole series--WOW! I find it interesting that almost all of the over 1200 reviews here are 5 stars! And the ones that are only one star? Check out their other reviews. They don't give good reviews to anything. They're just trying to throw off the rating. Well, it's not working is it?  <br /> <br />Do you like adventure, great characters and wonderful humor? Do yourself a favor and see this series. I guarantee you won't be sorry you did!
B000000WCV|5.0|To think that it is nearly 10 years since this was released is incredible. I remember being freaked out by the Da Funk video with the talking dog and the video for Around The World was a clever piece of videowork. But anyway, it's incredible to think that after nearly a decade in circulation, it has aged well.  <br /> <br />Despite, the previous two that I mentioned ( which have gone on to be dancefloor classics ), the rest of the album is just as good with particular mentions to Indo Silver Club and Alive. Alive in particular, sounds very claustrophobic. Really gets you going. Still worth it after all these years.
B00000JSJC|4.0|There are aspects of this movie that are sure to offend some people and it's obvious from the 1 star reviews that certain individuals were offended by those aspects of the film, which clearly clouded their judgment and precluded them from presenting an objective and accurate review.<br /><br />The basic storyline is as follows: There exists a technology that was created by the government, which found it's way on the streets and has since been outlawed. Due to the emotional need for this new tech, it is created and sold on the underground (much like the situation with LSD in the 60's).<br /><br />The technology is a device that allows the user to experience sequences that were recorded so that it is like they are really there in the scene. This is not virtual reality where you are the one moving around, you experience what was recorded exactly as it happened. The device works through sending the signal or whatever into the nuerotransmitters of the brain so all the senses are affected.<br /><br />Most of the sequences are thrilling and allow people who live ordinary lives to experience certain behavior that they otherwise would never know, or people in relationships to experience sexual fantasies wherein they feel as if it is actually happening when it is not, hence they are not actually cheating. Then there are the more immoral sequences, the misuses, etc., that are the cause for the conflict in the film.<br /><br />Feines is a dealer who is obsessed with his ex whom he has several sequences of which allows him to relive his past when they were together. He happens upon a sequence which is quite illegal, actually two of them, and he, along with a potential love interest (Angela Bassett), tries to find out who was responsible. What he finds out is a shocking cover-up that puts his life in danger.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews, this movie is thrilling with a fascinating look at a riveting form of entertainment technology. It is not a straight-up sci fi flick, it is more than that. I would label it as a thriller with some sci fi aspects to it, not the reverse. The acting is well done and since it only takes place about 5 years in the future (from the time it was made), the setting does not look radically different than the present. To say it should is stupid. It is 12/31/1999, not 2050.<br /><br />The best part of the film are the 'sequences', which are, of course, shot in the 1st person, and allows you to imagine what the person is feeling as he is hooked up to the device. As I mentioned, there are some disturbing scenes, including a crime involving a woman, that some people were upset over, but to ask how a woman could direct a movie that has a scene involving a crime against a female is insulting to any woman in the industry. What do you think, women should only be allowed to direct movies like Bridget Jones Diary? That is the more misogynistic view, in my opinion.<br /><br />Regardless, Strange Days is a fascinating thriller w/ a great plot and riveting action, not to mention a brilliant opening scene, that will leave you fully satisfied.as a thriller with some sci fi aspects to it, not the reverse.

038073186X|5.0|Dennis Lehane is one of those rarest of mystery writers.  He has a character driven sensibility.  There always is a mystery, but what makes the mystery so great is how it matters to the main players.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels is a US Marshal searching for an escaped mental patient on an island just off of Boston's coast.  His \\"partner\\" is Chuck Aule, and from the very beginning Lehane invests us in a wrold that is just a bit askew.  Nothing is as it seems, of course, and cryptic clues abound.  But Teddy is a great tragic character, and that is why this novel succeeds.  He walks willingly into the mayhem and is both determined to find the truth, and in complete denial of it.<br /><br />To tell you any more of the plot would be to give away too many intelligent twists.  Twists is truly the correct word here, as you can feel your insides twist with each new clue.  When the puzzle is finally pieced together there is no celebration or welcome relief.  The story is a heavy one that Lehane makes sure will stick in your throat for days to come.<br /><br />Lehane adds great weight to his mysteries, investing us not just in following the clues, but also in the human consequences of the actions that created the enigmas.  Do not read Lehane for cut and paste clue-happy fun.  When you sit down with one of his novels be prepared to be beaten with the burden of sin and the downright inhumanity of the human race.<br /><br />When you are donesmarting from \\"Island\\"'s harrowing conclusion, read it again to see how well it adheres.
0767821629|4.0|Yes, this movie pre-dates the Matrix and in fact has a much more interesting storyline than that film. I see why the 2 are so often compared, but I would describe the 13th Floor as an intellectual version of the Matrix. <br /> <br />The plot has already been discussed so I am going to simply mention some of my favorite aspects of this film. It was fascinating how these programmers could create such a realistic virtual world, wherein the people are programs and have no idea of the truth (see, how the Matrix ripped it off?). Imagine finding out you are nothing but a bunch of 1's and 0's and there is no possibility for change or escape? <br /> <br />It is exceedingly clever how one character leaves clues in the virtual world that allows another character to help solve a mystery in the real one. <br /> <br />Interestingly, perhaps due to a limited budget, more attention was paid to the actual story instead of filling the screen with all kinds of cheesy cgi, which resulted in a better, more fulfilling movie, as opposed to a simple action flick. <br /> <br />Vincent D'Onofrio submits yet another stellar acting performance. I am always floored by how he can look so completely different from one role to the next. Check out the brilliant independant flick, Salton Sea, if you are a fan. (As an aside, while I did not particularly enjoy The Cell, Vincent gave the most chilling performance I have ever seen in my life and one that I will never forget...too bad Jlo was involved.) <br /> <br />If you are interested in the concept of virtual reality or even parallel worlds, or maybe just new types of entertainment technology, you will no doubt enjoy the 13th Floor. While it is a slow-moving drama, the intriguing storyline and believable performances will keep you more interested in this film in the long run than some cheesy, special effects laden popcorn flick.
B000002B1M|4.0|This album is another great Hip-Hop Classic. Of course it's not as good as Illmatic, but you seriously can't top that. So go and get this album if you haven't already.
0743454529|5.0|I have always loved Jodi's novels, from when I first read The Pact. She has a style of writing that avoids schmaltz but breaks your heart every time. Her characters are rich and real, and she really makes you think. Every time I read something of hers, I always wind up deep in thought for days and I have yet to not cry at the end (I'm a bit of a sap, yes, but she earns the tears). I will always buy her books without a second thought.
B0000029GA|5.0|You know, I wonder why Hip-Hop isn't this good. This is one one Hip-Hop's Greatest Albums and Nas's best. You just can't argue with it. You can sit and listen to this album over and over again and never get tired of it because its true Hip-Hop. Seriously, words cannot explain how good this album is ,only for 10 tracks and each one is a hit.  <br /> <br />I mean I'm only 17 years old, but I know good music when I hear. I used to listen to this album back when I was 7 or 8 years old. If I was to see a 7 or 8 year old listening to this album today, I would be suprised because everybody from 5 - 25 years old is getting corrupted by all this wack crap thats coming out. But I'm glad this came out when I was little because this is a album that can bring back some memories. Like after you read this review, listen to this album and I'm absolutely positve that if you listened to it nack in the day, you can help but to have memories. Good ones too. <br /> <br />So this album is the best. Go and get it if you don't have it anymore, and if you've never heard it, what are you waiting for? Stop reading and get the album!!!!
B00005JMXX|1.0|It's a shame that the talents of Jake Gyllenhal, Emmy Rossum and others were wasted on this tripe. The special effects are breathtaking but the writing quickly devolves into worse-than-generic disaster talk. Even taken with a grain of salt, this movie is a definite PASS. It's 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back.
B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|Nightwish have once again failed to progress.  In a desperate attempt to capture Metal and Opera they have failed terribly.  An earlier review said that 'Once' was like an adventure, yet I would have to be high as kite to agree with this becuase the adventure would only go as far as my trash can.  The singing is out of key.  The guitars are toned down too far and mixed with silly synthesiser sound effects makes the whole charade give you earache.  I would much prefer to be tortured with electrodes then put my music system through this again. However, there is one good thing to say about the album 'Once', it makes a dam good 'frisby'.  So Nightwish, go back to Europe and die.
0060958324|5.0|The style is flat and uninteresting; but this is a fascinating quest, in fiction form, about what philosophers have said about Quality.  The search is interwoven with the central character's journey on a motor cycle across the United States, with the landscape symbolizing the quest (e.g. ruminations about the most difficult philosophy while he is in the rarefied air on very high mountains).
B000002UAC|4.0|In general the British Beatle albums are of better quality. There are more tracks as compared to American albums and the quality of the tracks are usually better. The British \\"Hard Day's Night\\" as opposed to the American \\"Something New\\" is a definite example. \\"Something New\\" is a disgrace! The British \\"Help\\" as opposed to the American \\"Help\\" is another example.  <br /> <br />Of course, there are a few exceptions. The American Magical Mystery Tour was actually an album in the U.S. which included five extra tracks--and EXCELLENT ones at that, and the U.K. only had a VERY mediocre E.P. Another exception is this one. The British \\"With the Beatles\\" does not quite stand up to the American \\"Meet the Beatles\\". Oh yes, there are more tracks on the British album but in this case, quantity does not replace quality.  <br /> <br />The American \\"Meet the Beatles\\" has the tracks \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"This Boy\\" which were never released on any album in the U.K. (only recently did \\"Past Masters\\" show up). In addition the American \\"Meet the Beatles\\" has all Beatle written tracks. There is no cover garbage to use as filler. <br /> <br />Let's be honest about another fact! When it comes to Motown music, the Beatles were like porcupines in a balloon factory. If a Motown singer were to sing Beatle music, obviously, the Beatles could do it better. Consequently when the Beatles sang Motown, the Motown artists could do that better. In this it would have made far more sense for the artists to stay in their own backyard!   <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|I never liked him that much anyway. It's career <br />suicide to diss hip hop's elite. Enjoy the mansion <br />50. Just don't do a MC Hammer you'll have no where <br />to hide.
B0002V7ODI|4.0|Just proves you can overcome your birth.  Hellboy was born out of a hole in a transcendental portal that was a joint project of Rasputin and the Nazis in a last-ditch attempt to create the New World Order.<br /><br />He was raised by Prof. Bloom and works for the Bureau of Psychic Phenomenon, a group set together to battle evil.  He's red as an apple,  smokes stogies, files his horns to fit in, and likes cats.<br /><br />The graphics, the concept is faithful to the comics.  I think the action could have been upped a bit.  There are quite a few slower portions in the films unlike Xmen, or Blade, for example.<br /><br />Overall, a good and interesting film and an essential for Hellboy comic fans who want a 'complete set.'
B000000OQF|4.0|Oooooookaaaaayyyy.....well, I guess what you see MY personal favorite track on the cd is. I'm not going to exaggerate on this review. Here goes: <br /> <br />I really like Guns N Roses and there are some ROCKIN' songs here. This is highly recommended from me to you if you enjoy metal or this band at all. Any kind of metal, just see if you like this album by listening to it's samples....or...yeah. There's not much else left that I can say in this review. You know? TOTAL MIND BLOCK IN THE MAKING OF THIS REVIEW.
B0000011N5|4.0|There are plenty of reviews detailing the fabulous tunes found upon this disc. No home is complete without it. BGO issued a mono version of this CD and followed it with a slightly better sounding stereo version. Collectors Choice has since released a superior (stereo) disc. It sounds like someone finally located the master tapes. Pick up a copy. Your ears will thank you.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|<br />\\"Angel of Retribution\\" by Judas Priest is quite simply magnificent!  Ten scorching Heavy Metal tracks so hot you had better handle this CD with oven mitts and a hot pad.   Back in the fold is legendary original vocalist Rob Halford who hasn't been heard on a Judas Priest CD since 1990's \\"Painkiller\\" along with the dual guitar wizardry of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton, bassist Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis. From the opening song \\"Judas Rising\\" to the last song\\" Lochness\\" the listener is treated to a rollercoaster ride of larger than life guitar riffs, piercing machinegun-like precision guitar solos, lush acoustic passages (see track 7 \\"Angel\\"), one of the tightest rhythm sections in Metal music and the immensely talented multi octave vocals of Rob Halford.   It is my opinion that this is easily the best release since Screaming For Vengeance and Hell Bent for Leather.  Stand out tracks are Judas Rising, Revolution, Demonizer, Wheels of Fire, and Lochness.  <br /> <br />Included in this special package is a DVD entitled \\"Reunited\\" which features interloping live footage from the band's June 2004 reunion concerts in Spain with interviews with all the band members talking about reasons for the reunion with Halford and their inspiration for the new CD's songs.  Tracks played are \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"Metal Gods, \\"Touch of Evil\\", \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\",  \\"Hellion/Electric Eye\\", the Joan Beaz cover \\"Diamonds and Rust\\", and \\"Living After Midnight\\".  This CD/DVD package is not to be missed!
B0007NFL1S|3.0|I really am a 50 cent fan, but this album just didnt live up to the hype.  Its got some catchy tunes but the lyrical content is whack and repeated in a majority of the songs. This album really doesn't have standing power, most of the songs will play out in about a week or two.  What really kills me is the beef with jada, fat joe, shyne, and nas(kelis too). What the heck is he thinking?  Hes trying to build his rep on controversy not hot songs. Candy shop anyone? depends on your taste. Piggy Bank? sounds like a muppet babies title.

B00007AJF9|1.0|While the reviewer below certainly is wrong about the historical facts, he is right, this movie is a terrible distortion of English history. To enlighten him and those who're interested in \\"the wisest woman who ever lived\\" (William Cecil): <br /> <br />1) There WAS a mood of rising protestantism as this movie starts. (1558) Mary HAD been popular after overthrowing the tragic Lady Jane Grey and her greedy father. She had been popular for being King Henry's daughter and for what she had to go through in her father's reign. BUT when she began to burn old men, women and even pregnant women she lost a great deal of sympathy. And when she married England's arch-enemy, Catholic King Philipp of Spain (Her mother's great-nephew) she lost whatever love the English had for this half-Spanish Queen. The fact that she supported her husband in an expensive war against France and that she lost Calais also cost her a great deal and it showed what a bad ruler she was. Heretical rebels? Old priests like gentle Thomas Cranmer and pregnant peasant-women were heretical rebels? However biased can one be! <br /> <br />2) Mary DID NOT like to surrender her throne to her mother's rival's daughter. Only when Elizabeth agreed to pay Mary's horrid debts and agreed to to fight Catholicism didn't Mary resign to her fate. (After two phantm-pregnancies)  <br /> <br />Now for Nr. 3: To say that Elizabeth was impotent as Queen is laughable. I'll refute the \\"examples\\" one by one. <br /> <br />Accusation: A: She had personally given her royal assurance to the Spanish Minister that the Spanish treasure ships bearing the pay for Alva's soldiers in the Netherlands, the ships which had taken refuge from pirates in English harbors, should be released and the money taken under safeguards to its proper destination. Cecil simply overruled her. He ordered the money to be confiscated and his orders were obeyed, not hers.  <br /> <br />Answer: Ever heard of the word diplomacy? It had been Elizabeth's plan to seize the ships from the beginning. She, being a magnificent liar, sweet-talked the Spanish ambassador while Cecil took the blame. He obeyed his Queen's REAL wishes. And was honoured afterwards. I'm sure Elizabeth had a good laugh at the Spaniards' folly. By seizing these ships Elizabeth not only hurt the Spaniards but won the support and friendship of the Netherlands (Fellow protestants). Later she sent Leicester down there as gouvenor. She won the support of the Netherlands, Scotland, the Hugenotts etc. by this brilliant act of diplomacy. Cecil, being his mistress' \\"conscience\\" bore the blame gracefully. <br /> <br />Accusation2: \\"B: She desired to save Norfolk. Three separate times she tried to stop the execution. Cecil overruled and had him put to death.\\" <br /> <br />Not true. Since Norfolk was a relative of the Queen it's natural that having to sign his death-warrant caused her grief. Plus he was a Duke by blood, one of the oldest families in the country. Cecil NEVER overruled Queen Elizabeth, he was wise enough to warn those who wanted to that if they dared to attack her as a sovereign she'd cut them down with no mercy. One whom he advised but who didn't listen was the Earl of Essex. Elizabeth had him put to death for trying to overrule and depose her. If needed, she was as hard as iron. <br /> <br />Accusation Nr.3: \\"C: She tried to recall Drake and stop England from declaring war on Spain. No one thought to heed her orders.\\" <br /> <br />Another brilliant way of diplomacy that he misunderstood. Elizabeth \\"wanted\\" to recall Drake when he was \\"safely far away enough\\" to attack Cadiz \\"against the Queen's wishes\\". She made a fuss, kept the booty and prevented the Armada from sailing much sooner than it actually did. She knighted Drake for all he did.  <br /> <br />Accusation Nr. 4 \\"D: The supreme example is the murder of Mary, Queen of Scots. We are often led to believe that Elizabeth faked remorse at having her cousin executed. This is totally false. Elizabeth washorrified. She did everything she could to stop Ceil from having Mary beheaded. Again, no one paid attention to England great, powerful, wise Queen Elizabeth, so legendary for her strength of will and character.\\" <br /> <br />Now this is completely off the mark. Mary, Queen of Scots, who had planned to murder her cousin, had her husband murdered (To marry her husband's murderer whose children she would have born out of wedlock otherwise) had been deposed by her outraged people who wanted to have her executed. Mary, after abusing Elizabeth's patience for years, fled to England. The country she wanted to rule herself. As for Elizabeth on Mary's death: The only qualms she had were the facts that it wasn't wise to have another Queen executed and that Mary was her cousin. She had protected Mary for over 17 years from her council and her people. When she signed the warrant it was dispatched and done with. She DID fake remorse AND was horrified at the same time. She dismissed both Walsingham and Cecil after the deed for a long time. Plus the man who delivered the warrant to be dealt with (Davison) was condemned to die which was later turned to life in prison. Cecil DID NOT have Mary put to death. Elizabeth signed the death-warrant. If anyone had a major part in this it was Lord Walsingham. Get your facts straight and don't spread nonsense.  <br /> <br />Accusation Nr.5: \\"Elizabeth secretly held deep sympathy for the Catholic Church. As a young girl, she grew up amidst the cynical, elitist class of intellectuals who doubted Catholicism mainly because they wanted its wealth. Elizabeth was naturally influenced by such propaganda. But in time, she grew to understand just how villainous was the plundering of England's great abbeys and churches so that greedy nobles, disguised as religious reformers, could grow wealthier. It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.\\" <br /> <br />This is complete nonsense for severalreasons. When it came down to decide which cause she should support it was always Protestantism which she chose. She herself wasn't a Puritan (Like Walsingham was) and didn't burn Catholics but when it came down to punish those Catholics who wanted to murder her (Babington is the most prominent figure) she had no problem to have them tortured and killed as traitors. Nothing of Elizabeth's thoughts on her father's deeds (Plundering the abbeys and churches) was ever recorded, it was, like her thoughts on her mother, a private matter which she never spoke of. (No testimonies survived) So don't ASSUME things, this is not fiction, it's history. And the evidence points against that lame theory. As for THIS: \\"It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.\\" <br /> <br />Well he DID! Does the ARMADA ring a bell? And Elizabeth didn't help her enemy there, that's for sure. She went to see her troops in person and spoke to them passionately to overthrow the enemy! And BOY, they won magnificently! After that Elizabeth became GLORIANA. So that \\"theory\\" is certainly false. <br /> <br />Now to this movie. It's wrong beyond belief. Elizabeth is portrayed as a weakling who's influenced first by Dudley, then by Walsingham. (Who wasn't her advisor back then) Plus the stories of Marie de Guise being murdered, Marie de Guise sleeping with her nephew, Elizabeth sleeping with Dudley, the Spanish ambassador being murdered etc. are all fiction. I could go on and on about the costumes being all wrong, the locations totally off etc. But it's not necessary. For a real portrait of England's greatest monarch ever watch Elizabeth R. with Glenda Jackson. She makes you believe what Elizabeth said: \\"I will have no master but only one mistress here!\\"
B0007P3582|3.0|I really am a 50 cent fan, but this album just didnt live up to the hype. Its got some catchy tunes but the lyrical content is whack and repeated in a majority of the songs. This album really doesn't have standing power, most of the songs will play out in about a week or two. What really kills me is the beef with jada, fat joe, shyne, and nas(kelis too). What the heck is he thinking? Hes trying to build his rep on controversy not hot songs. Candy shop anyone? depends on your taste. Piggy Bank? sounds like a muppet babies title. Disco Inferno? so so....He better deliver next time and stop with the beef, because what will he do, when he runs out of cats to beef with? 50 STEP YOUR GAME UP or like Jay-Z said ONE HOT ALBUM EVERY TEN YEAR AVERAGE................ THE GAMES ALBUM IS A MUCH BETTER.  <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|I have never heard such garbage.  Nuff said.
B00011D1OA|3.0|Of all the films on Audrey Hepburn's impressive resume, I have to admit this 1964 multiple Oscar winner may be the most disappointing, though ironically it is probably her most famous role. Veteran women's director George Cukor seems to have made an irreparable error in filming the Cinderella-style story in such a stage-bound and often stilted manner, obviously to reflect more accurately the then-revered Broadway version. What is missing is true cinematic invention in telling a most enchanting story with interesting questions raised around the power of personal transformation.<br /><br />What remains true, however, is the fact that composer Frederic Lowe and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner (who wrote the screenplay) have fashioned the quintessential Broadway musical by turning George Bernard Shaw's \\"Pygmalion\\" into a frothy ugly duckling tale filled with some of the best known show tunes ever: \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\\", \\"The Rain in Spain\\", \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\", \\"On the Street Where You Live\\", \\"I'm Getting Married in the Morning\\", \\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\", \\"Show Me\\" and \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.\\" As if you don't know already, the songs interweave through a story that follows the evolution of a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, who is trained by Professor Henry Higgins, a misogynistic linguistics expert and confirmed bachelor, to speak properly within six months, the result of a challenge and bet with the dotty Colonel Pickering. Lengthy elocution lessons follow, interrupted by her mercenary drunk of a father and a persistent, love-struck swain. Eliza makes an eye-catching though ultimately embarrassing first appearance at the opening day Ascot Races, but triumphs among the bluebloods at the climactic Embassy Ball. Inevitably, Higgins becomes smitten with his transformed pupil, who returns to him only after proving her personal liberation.<br /><br />Visually, despite Cecil Beaton's extravagant costumes and Gene Allen's detailed art direction, there is a persistent lethargy captured on screen perhaps because the camera set-ups feel so static. Hepburn seems to enjoy playing the guttersnipe, though her lowbrow manner never feels very authentic perhaps because of our predisposition to the carefully groomed actress already a dozen years into her career at that point. Even though she seems a mite mature for the role, she looks stunning after her aural breakthrough, especially in her elaborate Ascot dress and hat. Her lip-synching to Marni Nixon's vocals is a problem though not because she is not doing her own singing but because of the sometimes jarring disparity between her throaty speaking voice and the soprano singing voice coming out of her. Rex Harrison plays Higgins as the role he was born to play and certainly convinces as a demanding linguist. He seems less assured as a romantic lead, and consequently we are rather indifferent at the end to his romantic fate with Eliza. For all its flaws, however, the movie does manage to convey the musicality of the stage version effectively. I just wish the rest of the movie was up to the level of the score.<br /><br />The two-disc set is a great package for aficionados. The second disc includes an excellent making-of documentary made in 1994 and hosted by Jeremy Brett, who plays Eliza's unfulfilled suitor, Freddy, in the movie, as well as alternate takes which use Hepburn's  true vocals on \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?\\" and \\"Show Me\\" (she's quite good but obviously not trained enough for the other more demanding songs).ent lethargy captured on screen perhaps because the camera set-ups feel so static.

B000001Y16|5.0|This album changed my entire view of rap music and rap artists as a whole. I have always listened and enjoyed rap music, but this album made it so much more for me.  For me to listen to this album and think about all \\"signs\\" it gives out to make you think that possibly, Tupac, rather Makavieli is alive today, is amazing. The songs on this album describes human emotions, that everyone has felt, better than any form of music, literature, or poetry I have ever came across.  I know that some of you will read this and think that this criminal \\"gangster\\" cannot have a sense of knowledge to be able to go this deep, but believe me, you dead wrong! This album changed the way I look at any album or artist, and this album has been a true inspiration in my life.
B00006G8HX|3.0|This was just an average outing into the world of Star Trek.You pretty much knew that they wouldn't let Spock stay dead.What would Star Trek have been without Spock?So this is how they brought him back from the dead.Too bad they decided to destroy the Enterprise,it was kind of stupid to destroy the original ship,only to bring it back at the end of The Voyage Home(ala the ressurection of Spock?)All they did was paint an \\"A\\" onto the original studio model of the Enterprise(Watch the end of Star Trek-The Motion Picture.When it emerges from the VGer cloud two lights can be seen moving along the upper,primary hull(saucer)towards the bridge.Then watch the end of Star Trek IV.Same scene,except for the added \\"A\\".)C+ rating at best.
B000059ZT4|5.0|How Island Records thought the undubbed version needed overdubs and studio sweetening is beyond me. Hearing these songs in their original unpolished form is like listening to entirely different album, in the best possible sense.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This movie compares favorably with Star Trek II-The Wrath of Kahn and The Undiscovered Country.There is a lot of action,a great,fast paced story line,and the first appearance of the stunningly beautiful U.S.S. Enterprise,NCC-1701E.Great Trek film.Very satisifying.Now,why couldn't the last two been this good??
B00079018K|5.0|Kasabian may not be as original as some may want them to be, but their music is still great and still does provide a different sound from much of the stuff out there now. And honestly, the lack of originality isn't any different than bands like The Bravery, and a lot of other bands being hailed as \\"the next big thing,\\" and nobody seems to care about that so why should Kasabian get stick for it when the music is good?  <br />L.S.F., Processed Beats, Cutt Off, and Club Foot are definite highlights on the album, the second half tapers off a bit. See them live if you can-they put on an entertaining live show, I saw them in London at the end of 2004, they sounded good and had the crowd in the palm of their hands.
B000083C49|3.0|This movie is,in my opinion,is no more than a repeat of Star Trek-The Motion Picture.Alien probe destroys starships  from the Klingons and Federation on its way to Earth.Alien probe threatens to destroy all life on Earth unless it recieves communication with someone (or something) on Earth.Kirk and crew to the rescue!!Please!!Why do people like this repeat so much?Not really a very creative attempt at a Star Trek story at all.
B0002X314C|5.0|I've had the CD for less than 2 weeks and I've heard it about 50 times. I'm absolutely addicted to this CD!! The music, lyrics and vibe take me back to when R&B music was about more than big cars and big butts. My favorite songs are \\"Refuge\\" and \\"So High\\".  Get the CD and you won't regret it.
B00000ILBK|2.0|Nothing worth commenting on here.Below average effort.Dumb.Was this written by Forest Gump?
B00028HBKC|1.0|Let me start out by saying that I am a Roman Catholic and I truly believe in the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.  I found this movie to simply be 126 minutes of torture.  I was not inspired or moved in any way.  It was a total waste of my time.  I wondered whatever possessed Mel Gibson to make this movie, and have come the conclusion that it must be the $500 million he has made on it.  I understand that it is being re-released in time for Easter with six minutes of the brutality being cut out, like that will make this disgusting, ugly movie any more palatable.
B0000683DH|5.0|The title says it all!!The very best of all of the Star Trek films.
0385510454|3.0|I won't repeat all the other reviews. I am a Grisham fan, and while this book was okay I felt ripped off by the steep price commanded by the hardback. <br /> <br />My advice is to skip it if you are not a die hard grisham fan like I am, wait for the paperback and save a few bucks if you are..........
B0000UJL96|5.0|This film,the sixth and last that featured the original crew in its' entirity,is truely one of the best in the series,ranking right up there with Wrath of Kahn.It is definately better than The Voyage Home(over rated Star Trek pap,if you ask me!!!)and has a lot of originality,unlike Star Trek 4 and ,Insurrection ,and Nemesis.
1400034779|4.0|\\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" by Alexander McCall Smith deals with Mma. Ramotswe, who is the only female detective in Botswana. With the money that she received from the sale of her deceased father's cattles, she started the agency despite skepticism from others. Despite the fact that it was unusual for a female to be a detective, Ramotswe was able to solve cases using her intuition, creativity as well as intelligence. Her cases are usually small such as finding a kidnapped boy, uncovering a bogus father, etc.  <br /> <br />This is a light read and rather enjoyable as the author brings his readers through the different cases and the creativity that Ramotswe used to solve the mysteries. The heroine is extremely likeable and has a great sense of humor. In addition, the author was able to bring in bits and pieces of Ramotswe's past which I find very informative and interesting as it shaped Ramotswe to become the strong person that she is. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a relaxing and fun read.
B00005JLRT|1.0|The title says it all!!I hope that this is indeed the very last Star Trek film ever made!!
B0000047BA|5.0|This is one of the ultimate blues albums of all time. It is deep blues; for those who love it. The movie should be ignored.
B00005JKHP|4.0|This film,the very first in the Star Trek film series,is way under rated by most reviewers.While the story is slow moving,the special effects are absolutely the very best ever seen up to 1979,the year the film was released.Costing around $42 million dollars to make,Star Trek-The Motion Picture was the most expensive film that had ever been made.I remember skipping school the day the film was released in theatres.I wanted to be among the first people in Reno to see it and let me tell you,at 11:30am that theatre was packed with nearly every seat filled!!I liked it-and I still like it to this day.It certainly isn't Wrath of Kahn,but what is?I loved the refit ,movie Enterprise.I had chills up my spine the very first time I saw her.This movie is even better now with the release of the directors cut to DVD.They have done a great job splicing the new footage into the original film-you can't tell it's been done unless you're like me and you have seen it a million times.I have a copy on VHS that is an original,1980 release to video of the film-no extra scenes.I love the extras on disc two.I definately reccomend it over the repeat story Star Trek IV-The Voyage Home.
B000002J03|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time.  Everyone should own this and III.  This is a band that has sculpted music into what it is today and to say any less means you don't listen to or understand good music.  You don't need a song by song review for this album.  Buy it.  You will love it.  If you don't like this album it is because you don't want to, plain and simple.  Rock and Roll at its finest.
B0000AUHOH|1.0|This is undoubtedly the worst of the Star Trek movie series.Directed by William Shatner,it should have been titled \\"Star Trek meets T.J.Hooker\\"simply because Shatner tried to direct it with the same style that he used to direct his old series.This should be thrown in the trash.F- at best.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Unlike the best of rap, culminating in the lyrical, creative style pioneered by Death Row artists like Dre and Snoop, and the genius Tupac, this album is comprised of machine-pressed beats over generic lyrics, with none of the creativity and melody of better rappers.   <br /> <br />I would recommend you stay away from this one and look for something better.  If you already have the Tupac, Dre and Snoop albums, you've pretty much exhausted the best there is and should perhaps branch off into far richer musical avenues.  If you're some angry cholo or a scrub with limited musical intellect, by all means get this it will make you thump and is so simple that even you can get it.
0440214041|5.0|Way better than the movie, and I liked the movie.  Grisham is so great at character development.  Haven't read anything by him that wasn't first class.  I just wish he'd get a new naming scheme: The Partner, The Client, The Summons, they're all the same  :)

B0007O38F8|5.0|I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL YOU PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS CD IS OFF THE CHAIN! I LIKE EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THAT CD. I COULD LISTEN TO THAT CD ALL DAY LONG. I THINK THAT THIS IS HIS BEST CD SO FAR.
B000268QB2|5.0|It bugs me how unwilling people are to embrace Keane debute as an alltime reference rather than try and cue them second in line. Where Keane sure don't fit -- for they are number one in everything associated with CORRECT pop idiom. In \\"Everybody's Changing\\" Keane champion Elton John's thick voicing and orderly key-poking - to say nothing about melody scaling. The album's weakest number (as often with singles), this one nevertheless stands as parallel world to the likes of Coldplay and all in the currently defeatist and Britpop-styled mainstream pop. On the spot I can't think of a worthy contender in the same vein, though it sure is stacked on a shopshelf somewhere. <br />
B00011RPB0|5.0|...and that's what I think I liked best about it.  Some complain that there is no plot and no jokes, yet wonder why so many of us like it enough to give it 5-stars (or offer it so many Academy Awards). The truth is what makes this movie such a gem is that it doesn't need to come out and smack you in the head with the type of dull, predicatable nonesense like most movies do these days.  It reminds me of older films; not in content or style, necessarily, but in its honest simplicity.  Why is it funny?  Not because its a constant joke machine, but because its just the opposite.  Does someone need to fall down, curse, get hurt, or otherwise make a fool out of themselves in order to be funny?  Well, to most people yes.  The reason why this movie is so funny is the same reason certain scenes in Casablanca are so funny, despite the seriousness of that film's subject: dialogue.  Because I haven't watched the movie lately, I'll leave it at that, and asure most of you that if you just relax and don't expect to see slapstick or stupid voices or people acting foolish, you might actually enjoy a movie that is funny in its simplicity. <br /> <br />Another thing worth mentioning is Bill Murray's performance.  Many people, including critics who enjoyed the film, thought that Murray's Oscar nomination was unwarrented; that he was simply \\"being\\" Bill Murry.  That's like saying (to use the Casablanca reference again) that Bogey was just being himself and didn't have to act to be Rick Blaine.  I strongly disagree.  Murray's performance isn't in your face like most of his, or other actor's , performances.  True, he doesn't really have to \\"become\\" anyone, but he still has to act.  He has to be convincingly lonely, upset, tired, and frustrated, all the while being funny.  He doesn't just do it, it does it better than most actors could.  I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does \\"funny\\" he can only seem to do a certain kind of in-your-face funny...that's not what this movie needed, and thank God thats not what it tried to do. <br /> <br />Finally, the script.  Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.  All it asks of us is to give up two hours to watch to lonely Americans who find themselves in the same place, waiting for things to happen.  In the end, they become great friends and they decide to go out and make things happen. It doesn't need a caper of any kind. It doens't need explosions or any kind of love affair.  This is a character driven Comedic-Drama (or Dramatic-Comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.  I can't wait to see this movie again.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I've heard many people taking this album and comparing it to the novel (and often strange) sounds that Deloused in the Comatorium was. While their debut album was irrefutably a stepping-stone in progressive rock, to compare Frances the Mute with their previous album is illogical, even unfair. The two albums take on almost completely different sounds. In my humble opinion, Deloused in the Comatorium was a lot of experimentation with different sounds and styles of music. More of a trial and error sort of situation, you could say. While experimentation is most definitely not a bad thing, there were, perhaps, one too many erred trials on their first album. Though the album was undoubtedly ingenius, as well as disturbingly graphic and undeniably beautiful, there were just too many things wrong with the CD to even compare it to this one.  <br /> <br />The beauty of Frances the Mute is the general consistency the album tends to maintain. It flows perfectly, telling a brilliantly written story in both English and Spanish. The techno-ish precursors to each movement are (sometimes) a bit too long for my tastes, though they seem to even the album out in the end. Time changes, key changes, and fluctuating tempos run rampant throughout the CD, leaving the listener baffled at the sheer complexity of the music. The vocals are even more beautiful than the original album, and the guitaring is impressive beyond that of your typical band-on-the-rise. I swear to you that Cedric is going to be the next Carlos Santana. Minus the mediocre drumming that remains static throughout the album, the Mars Volta definitely delivers in Frances the Mute. Five stars, no doubt about it.
6305313687|5.0|While bringing up an important lessons about the wringness on neo Nazism & white supremacy, the over 'touchy feely'' and 'we're here to teach you a lesson'attitude of the film, using your standard Hollywood techniques (such as black & white flashbacks) was a little offputting.<br /><br />On the other hand, the performances (especially by Edward Norton), the direction & the storytelling made up for it quite well.<br /><br />The story starts in the present - Danny Vineyard (Edward Furlong) is in trouble at school again, because he wrote an assignment that sheds heroic light on Adolf Hitler. While his history teacher (a Jew who we later learn had dated Danny's mother, but was driven off by the rest of the family's attitude) would like to see him expelled for good, the school principal (who happens to be black) would like to give him another chance - and gives him an assignment - to write a paper on the effect his older brother has had on his life.<br /><br />The older brother, Derek (Edward Norton) has been a bright kid, but turned into a 'skin head' neo nazi at a certain point in highschool - and things just got worse & worse until Derek has been incarcerated for killing a black man who tried stealing his car. Being charismatic, he's the most dominant member of his neo nazi gang - led by an older man (Stacy Keach) who doesn't like to get his hands dirty, so he lets the boys (led by Derek) to do it for him. Danny is also affected by Derek's rhetoric, and turns into a skin head himself when Derek isn't home.<br /><br />While writing his assignment, Danny flashes back into the family's history, trying to undertand why his older brother went for the white supremacy rhetoric in the first place, and hears his brother's \\"change of heart in jail\\" story (that may be a little too graphic), when trying to save his little brother from a fate he now understand is wrong.
B0007P3582|4.0|For Curtis Jackson, the stage name 50 Cent fits him perfectly. From his times as a drug dealer, he was forced to make a dollar out of fifty cents. A lot of people dub \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" as a classic, but I didn't see it that way. Sure, it was a very impressive debut, but he did make rookie mistakes with putting lackluster tracks such as \\"Blood Hound,\\" \\"Don't Push Me,\\" and \\"Poor Lil Rich\\" onto the cd. \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\", however, did leave 50 Cent with a lot of pressure in topping that ground that the album set. A lot of critics have trashed \\"The Massacre\\" thus far and they have the right to because this album is not \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\". But at the same time, even great artists release albums that are not worthy of their potential (come on Jay-Z, Rakim, and even Nas have released bad albums). And 50 Cent's \\"The Massacre,\\" definitely is not a classic, but it is not a dud by any stretch of the imagination. 50 Cent brought in a lot of heavy hitters as far as production goes, including Scott Storch, Hi-Tek, Eminem, and Dr. Dre. But with the Aftermath print on the back cover, you will be surprised to learn that Dr. Dre only did two tracks on this album. Not that the latter producers suck, it's just that when an album is released off of the Aftermath record label, you expect to hear that familiar Dr. Dre s**t.    It's already evident from the \\"Intro\\" that this album's first title was the \\"St. Valentine Day's Massacre\\" and it would have been perfect, as far as marketing goes, because it was originally supposed to be released February 15th. But with 50 Cent's name on it, this album is going to sell like hot cakes anyway. The thing about this album is going to say a lot about 50's future. It will also answer the question if his drama is actually bigger than his art.    Album Overview:  1. Intro  2. In My Hood - After being shot nine times and taking some to the jaw, 50 Cent's flow is definitely unique. And this track is  a definite example of what I am talking about. It's not as anthemic as \\"What Up Gangsta\\" on \\"Get Rich\\" but it is fair in its own right.  3. This is 50 - 50 Cent really takes advantage of his flow on this one. On the last word in each bar, he really exagerates it to the fullest. It is a very redundant formula, but it works for the most part.  4. I'm Supposed To Die Tonight - A very impressive beat by Marshall Mathers. 50 Cent, however, isn't all too great. It's not as strong as the first two songs and is very mediocre at best. It's just the same formula he used with \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\" on his first album, but that fire just isn't here with this one.  5. Piggy Bank - Ah yes....the famous \\"Piggy Bank.\\" This is the diss track that has been creating a lot of buzz lately. 50 Cent takes the liberty to \\"lash\\" out at Nas, Fat Joe, Jadakiss, and Shyne. What do the first three have in common? Pretty much colloborations with Ja Rule, the man that 50 Cent had beef with on his first album. However, the brilliance that 50 Cent showed on \\"Back Down,\\" just is not here. 50 Cent's rhymes seem tired and half tried. To call this a diss track is an overstatement.  6. Gatman and Robbin - The beat samples the old school Batman television show theme, only sped up. Eminem guests on this one and offers 50 Cent a guest verse. I have to say, it was pretty hard to understand what the heck he was saying. It took at least 3 listens to break down what he actually said. With that said, it still serves as one of the album's stronger points.  7. Candy Shop - Heh heh. Man I don't care how many times this video has been #1 on 106 & Park, I ain't feelin' this. 50 spent all that time talking about Ja Rule and how he makes pop/crossover music, but 50 is doing the same thing here. By the way, do you remember Olivia's \\"Bizzounce\\" video back in 2001?  8. Outta Control - A typical Dr. Dre beat. Also it can be a possible future single for 50 Cent since the hook is easy to remember.  9. Get It In My Car - *Sigh*, this is probably the first realskippable track on \\"The Massacre.\\" I mean the lyrical content is just horrible and the chorus has to be one of the most horrible ones I have ever heard. With choruses like that, it makes me wonder if I could make it as a big rapper.  10. Ski Mask Way - Definitely a gem on this album. Probably won't survive as a single because the chorus is just too hardcore for any radio station to ever play it.  11. A Baltimore Love Thing - 50 Cent actually tries to creative (for once) by comparing love to drugs. I have to say a very nice attempt, but I'm not feelin' this one at all.  12. Ryder Music - Hi-Tek, the mastermind behind Talib Kweli albums, shows up with a great track. It's definitely one of those songs that you just sit back, chill, and relax when you hear it.  13. Disco Inferno - An earlier reviewer said that this song is using the same formula from Lloyd Banks's \\"On Fire\\" and that reviewer is absolutely correct. 50 Cent even still acknowledges his \\"In Da Club\\" success by having the first verse begin with \\"Go, go, go, go...\\" at the beginning.  14. Just A Lil Bit - This one is okay. It's a follow up of \\"Candy Shop\\" with Olivia. The hook can make it survive as a single if they can edit it out a bit.  15. Gunz Come Out - \\"Gunz Come Out\\" is on the opposite spectrum as far as Dr. Dre tracks are concerned. 50's gun fettish is very evident by the title and the chorus. This is probably the best song on the entire album, and it's just a shame that Dre only had this and \\"Outta Control\\" earlier.  16. My Toy Soldier - This is 50 Cent's version of \\"Like Toy Soldier\\" on Eminem's \\"Encore\\" and Eminem also produces this one as well. 50 Cent just seems off point with the beat, and Tony Yayo's lame verse doesn't help either.  17. Position of Power - The chorus isn't good but this I can handle. It's the typical subject matter that 50 Cent talks about and for this song it works for the most part.  18. Build You Up - I didn't even know Jamie Foxx was on the chorus at first. Follows the sameformula as \\"21 Questions,\\" but Nate Dogg's presence made that song hot. This, however, fails completely.  19. God Gave Me Style - Man......this is probably the first 50 Cent song I have ever heard when he tries to get deep and personal. I appreciate his attempt but I ain't buyin' it.  20. So Amazing - It's a crying shame that this song is going to be huge on TRL and 106 & Park because it's that crossover s**t that girls love. I don't like this song and it's probably the next single.  21. I Don't Need 'Em - If I'm Ghostface Killah right now, I am p**sed off. The beat definitely rips \\"Metal Lungies\\" from the \\"Pretty Toney Album.\\" I can't even analyze 50's lyrics because I was so upset when I heard this, I couldn't concentrate (take my word for it, \\"Metal Lungies\\" is better). This reminds me back in 2002 when Ja Rule had a song called \\"Mesmerized,\\" whose beat jocked Smilez & Southstar's \\"Tell Me,\\" which was also a single at that time.  22. Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Remix) - I was just going to say that there was a 50 Cent album without any of his G-Unit comrades on it but I was wrong. Take it or leave it. I don't find this one bad though.    \\"The Massacre\\" started off very strong in the beginning, but the material became to lacadasical and undriven. 50 Cent to me is a much better rapper when he is featured on other artists' s**t such as \\"How We Do,\\" \\"Hate It or Love It,\\" and \\"Magic Stick.\\" 50 Cent just doesn't seem to have that same focus on his solo projects. \\"The Massacre\\" shows flashes of greatness, but it has too many filler tracks. It's definitely better than an average rap album but we all expect more from a guy who has beef with it seems like every rapper in New York.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell, a true great, has been a favorite artist of mine since I first heard her voice and extraordinary creative sound in the late 1960s. I would never attempt to categorize her, or label her music, much less call her a rock performer as some do. Ms. Mitchell's music ranges from pop-rock to folk to jazz fusion, in a career spanning over three decades. She is a poet. Her ability to write lyrics of the most personal and moving kind is unique, and has remained remarkably consistent over time. Slightly off-kilter melodies and adventurous arrangements are her trademarks. Ms. Mitchell paints a variety of intense emotional landscapes, from a woman's perspective, in \\"Blue.\\" The range of her pure voice shows growing depth, which emphasizes her maturation as an artist. As a singer, writer and musician she is open and so honest. Her music seems to come from her soul, as do the biographical tales she spins in her songs.<br /><br />Joni invites the listener to accompany her on a trip through her life in \\"Blue.\\" \\"My Old Man\\" is a complex composition, filled with bittersweet soul searching. \\"A Little Green\\" is wrenching, about a woman who gives a child up for adoption. Since I learned that Joni Mitchell had done just that in her real life, the song evokes even stronger emotions in me. She sings of many places she has traveled, California, Rome, Paris, and icy winters in Canada, and takes us along with her imagery, painting  picture postcards in our mind's eye. \\"Carey\\" is bright and upbeat, while \\"This Flight Tonight\\" has an eerie quality. \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard,\\" where she seems to close off her heart, is one of my favorite cuts.<br /><br />I loved this recording when it came out in 1971. I love it more now. It is one of Joni Mitchell's best - and that says something!<br /><br />JANA
B000007638|5.0|A little bit of history first...I was lucky enough to see Wings Over America at Madison Square Garden in May 1976.  I still have my ticket stub...a $10 seat in the second section up from the floor, which my cousin got from a broker for the exorbitant price of $30!  How quaint that seems now. <br /> <br />Needless to say, everyone was jazzed up, being that it was Paul's first live appearance in the States in 10 years.  I cannot begin to describe the roar within the Garden when the band started with Venus and Mars/Rock Show, and of course at the line \\"...long hair at the Madison Square.\\" <br /> <br />And the absolute silence when Paul sang Yesterday. <br /> <br />Tripping the Live Fantastic, Paul Is Live and Back in the U.S. -- NONE of them compare to Wings Over America as live recordings.  Maybe it's that anticipation that was in the air after 10 years...maybe it was Paul knowing he had to score a knockout back on this side of the Atlantic.  Who knows?  All I know is that it's a superior live recording to the others in every way.   <br /> <br />
B0007O38F8|1.0|I like rap, don't get me wrong, but all artists/actors/celebrities are much more likeable if they don't carry a lot of hype.  That's all I read about anymore is who 50 is feuding with and seeing on TV so called inside looks on his life before he became a rapper.  I personally don't care who 50 is feuding with...seems to me he's a bit too oversensitive.  Anyway, this CD seems exactly like his last one.  I like \\"In the Club\\" and \\"P.I.M.P.\\" but that about does it for me.  He should have just released that CD and left well enough alone.
6305127638|4.0|Not having seen any other Star Trek feature film for years, I can't compare 'First Contact' to any other film and exclaim that 'This is the best Star Trek film ever!, etc. I'm not even a ranid fan of the show, but I &aacute;m fimiliar with the TNG characters & 'mythology'to have a solid enough background for enjoying the film.<br /><br />The film itself is a nice action filmwith a Star Trek twist, and a nice & interesting twist at that. It's only drawback is the fact that it does need some fimiliarity with the Star trek universe & mythology, which would make it very hard for non - trekkies to understand, enjoy, ad get into one of the most wonderful TV series ever!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Have you ever had a really nasty break up with a girl, and you can't forget it? Well, Joel has gone through the same situation with a girl named Clementine, He wants to forget her, but his heart wants to keep her. All through out the film, we see Joel(Jim Carrey) trying to cherish the love and respect that he had for Clemintine(Kate Winslet). What Joel doesn't relieze is that they are already erasing the memories one by one, and He loses Clementine every second. He gets her back by parading her through his deep and secluded memories of her, his childhood, and his parents. He then ends up going to her house and they reconcile and share a truly unqiue love moment, as they patch their relationship back up and start all over again.<br /><br />Micheal Gondry is a genius. He has such a creative mind, and creative ways to show how Joel's mind works, He has one of the most unique directing styles I have seen. He can take something ordinary, and twist it past complexion, and how we see things, he totally warps that. Charlie Kaufman is quickly becoming one of my favorite screenwriters, He has the knack for writing truly weird, but interesting stories. He can take words and make them sound different, He can take people and make them look different, he can take places and make them look unique, yet puzzling. He is a very gift man. Jim Carrey was robbed of a Oscar, He puts on one of the most dramatic and awe inspiring performances I have ever seen him do, He is quickly becoming more of a dramatic actor rather than a comedian. Kate Winslet, she is a fine young lady, She can absolutely act, and keep up with Jim Carrey, and She really had a chemistry with him. By the way, I love the end credits song by Beck, Everbody's Got To Learn Sometime is a beautiful song that is perfect for closing a movie like this. I thought this movie was ingenius and quirky. It was funny, sad, weird, and happy all at the same time. I highly recommend it.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I had never heard Madeleine Peyroux sing before until last weekend, when a friend played her new CD, \\"Careless Love,\\" for me. I was enchanted at first listen. Since then, I have heard many people couple her name with Billy Holiday's. I don't want to be contrary, but I don't want to compare her smoky smooth sound to anyone else's either. To me, there is no other like \\"Lady Day,\\" nor does there have to be. And Ms. Peyroux, who brings sensuality and a romantic languor to her songs, certainly does not have to stand in another vocalist's shadow. She clearly stamps her excellent collection of songs with her own special style - and a very classy one that is.<br /><br />The content of this CD is quite diverse, ranging from Hank Williams to a WWII favorite. Many of her cuts are romantic ballads which deal with heartache and love gone wrong. A melange of jazz, country and light blues, backed by rhythm-guitar, and occasionally a low-key Hammond organ, she covers Hank Williams' \\"Weary Blues,\\" Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance Me to the End of Love,\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" and makes them her own. The WWII era torch song \\"J'ai Deux Amours,\\" and \\"Careless Love,\\" the Bessie Smith oldie, are terrific. A cover of Elliot Smith's \\"Between the Bars\\" is sung with a haunting melancholy and is probably my favorite cut, along with a song called \\"No More.\\"  \\"This is Heaven To Me,\\" lovely and lullaby-like is pure heaven to hear. And \\"Don't Wait Too Long\\" is an original co-written by Jesse Harris and producer Larry Klein.<br /><br />A fine band joins her, including Larry Goldings on the keyboard, bassist David Piltch,  guitarist Dean Parks, and drummer Jay Bellerose.<br /><br />This is one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time. Needless to say I bought myself a copy the day after I heard it. It merits a spot in the collection of anyone who loves great jazz vocalists.<br /><br />JANA
B000077VPU|3.0|I'm a fan of Freddie Mercury so sometimes you have to overlook incomplete packages like this one. <br /> <br />One note, the jazz number sang over the end credits by Mercury is incredible. I've tried to track down the name of the song with no luck.
B000002LD2|5.0|I somewhat disagree with the reviewer that mentioned the song \\"Heroes\\" was being ripped off completely, I have to admit the song \\"Darklands\\" and \\"Heroes\\" have similar intros and the first verse of the song sounds similar, but that's as far as it goes. Regarding the JMC they made an art of using past formulas and melding them together and created something special, the bubblegum pop of the 60's with guitar feedback and nihilistic lyrics, nobody had done that before, nobody. I also disagree that this is a bland album, it's slower, a bit laidback, it has lot less distorsion that their debut album, but it is powerful, very melodic, and it stands with similar great albums from the 80's like \\"Closer\\" from Joy Division and \\"Pornography\\" from the Cure. <br />Lastly I have to say that most JMC fans agree that their first 3 albums (Psychocandy, Darklands & Automatic) are among the favorites, and in the 90's they fell into the \\"alternative\\" sound, too common those days.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|With Omar Hakim on drums, the late great Kenny Kirkland on piano, Daryl Jones, bass, Sting, bass, vocals, guitar, and Branford Marsalis on sax you will see Sting and band rehearse and make the transition from rock to a jazz infused band that loves whats it's doing and shows it on stage. <br /> <br />From the rehearsal in a beautiful french chateau outside Paris to there first gig IN Paris this DVD rocks. Sting knows the sound he is looking for but is open to the creativity of the musicians he has assembled. <br />You can also see what a hard nosed manager Miles Copeland is and maybe why there was a rift between his brother Stewart ( drummer for The Police)and Sting. Egos were definitely at play here. <br /> <br />This DVD is hard to describe as it has so much too it. I can only tell you I will now finally part with the VHS tape now that it is out on DVD. By it, and see why music is the universal language and how much fun it is to be in a band especially with this cast.  <br />
B0000YB7Z8|2.0|I had high hopes for this after reading the reviews here...  Boy what a disappointment.  No energy, annoying banter between songs, sorry song selection.  The studio versions are so much better.  Avoid!!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|\\"Brothers in arms\\", the fifth studio album by Dire Straits is their most popular, most sold and the one which had maximum number of popular songs, all at once. It is definitely the most wanted album among non-fans of the band and many of the die-hard fans of the band are carzy about this album, and why not even if you leave the two songs that rocked the world in 1985, i.e. 'Walk of life' and 'Money for nothing', their are fan favorites like 'Brothers in arms', 'So far away' and 'Your latest trick' and that does not end the list of good tracks. There are 'Why worry', 'Ride across the river' and 'The man's too strong'...only 'one world' is a little week to me. When I attended the Mark Knopfler concert last Monday (7th March, 2005), he still played four tracks from this particular album...20 years after release...that tells something...eh?    'So far away' has a recognizable riff, with a sentimental voice singing the words that never fails to warm. Great stuff!!!   'Money for nothing' is no unknown track, anybody looking into this page should have listened this dozens of time already. What more can I add, you know it all.  'Walk of life' is almost same as before. Only that this did not reach #1 in US and Sting's vocal is not there, which the previous had.  'Your latest trick' is a saxophone driven sentimental track again sung by a very sentimental voice of Mark Knopfler. This must be the most sentimental album made by the band.  'Why worry' tries to throw the message that even after mishap, things will be allright...just like there's sunshine after the rain. Simple lyrics that might touch your heart.  'Ride across the river' Good song.  In 'The Man's too strong' Mark used his guitar to create a sound that is quite acoustic but not fully. Different. It deals with confession of a criminal.  'One World' is probably the only song in the album I am not fond of, with his 'Ooo Ooo Ooo' is certainly not the best thing he has done. But not bad.  'Brothers in arms' is a marathonsong about soldier. The most sentimental and the best song of the album and accompanied by the best solo of the album. You need to listen this song. Awesome.    To me quite probably the second best by the band but I really can't decide clearly whether this, 'Making movies', 'Love over gold' or 'On every street' is the best. I think 'Making movies' is the one I like the most, followed by 'Brothers in arms', 'Love over gold' and 'On every street'. All four of these albums are Highly Recommended.

0385336810|5.0|I took this book to the beach and couldn't put it down.  Absolutely wonderful!
6305508550|5.0|This movie has enough good reviews, but I have to add my own. <br /> <br />True story -  <br /> <br />I rented this movie when my wife was staying at her sisters on a friday night. I watched it, laughed and thought \\"that movie was pretty funny.\\"    <br /> <br />Then I watched the whole thing again about ten minutes later and laughed even harder.   <br /> <br />I went to sleep. <br /> <br />I woke up and had to watch it one more time on Saturday before going to work.  This for me is not normal behavior, but Office Space is that funny. <br /> <br />all week I couldn't stop singing \\"damn it feels good to be a gangster\\"
0735619670|4.0|I am not a pro developer, and I barely develop or work with programming, I am at the learning time.. however when I started reading this book, it shows you a lot of current issues and erros that developers do.. it's nice and it's a great guiding tool.
B0007O38F8|4.0|The Massacre by 50 Cent may become a classic on the low <br /> <br />On the first listen, you will be disappointed and somewhat shocked at the content of the album, as I was when I first acquired my copy a couple of weeks in advance to the mass release.  However, as you analyze the record and try to understand why it was not good, various tracks begin stand out and reverse that perception. <br /> <br />My advice is don't count this one out yet, because it was made for retention and built to repell cd tower dust.
044024157X|3.0|I think that the book ought not to have been advertised like a thriller or suspense novel. It was entirely too slow moving and had too much detail to be one. It was a good novel about life in a small town in the south in the past, but definitely not a Grisham thriller. I thought that the cover and the back description were both misleading. They did not really tell what the book was actually about. I thought that the plot \\"twist\\" was way to obvious.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|A stunning comeback, and a classic from start to finish.  Fans must have never dared dream that Judas Priest would reunite to this standard.  From beginning to end this is fabulously entertaining.  Rob's effortless vocal dexterity maturing and mellowing with age, KK's and Glenn's guitars soaring, Ian Hill's bass commanding, and Scott Travis's brisk drumming driving everything onward.  Judas Priest are musicians at the height of their powers, with songwriting of a wonderful assuredness. <br /> <br />A fresh, warm, often energetic record that is far and away the best so far of 2005. <br />
0670033375|4.0|Despite the NYT's reviewer's attempt to simplify \\"Collapse\\" beyond recognition, I found this to be a well-argued and sophisticated analysis of the dynamics of societal responses to environmental stress. But it takes a real effort and dedication to get through it. It would be unfortunate if the book's faults caused its significance to be buried.<br /><br />A summary here would be neither necessary (see other reviews) nor adequate. But where \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" was about as well-honed as a 3000-year survey could be, \\"Collapse\\" is often baggy and self-indulgent. The author's penchant for list-making is given free rein. The overuse of the first-person makes you suspect a personal agenda or two of being at play. (Diamond admits that he has chosen the first and last chapters of his case studies not because that arch best illustrates his theme, but because he loved Montana as a teenager and now, late in life, has come to love Australia.) The two chapters on Greenland are repetitive. The effect is frequently wearisome, and I have to admit to skipping over the last part of many of the lists as well as the last part of the book itself.<br /><br />That is, I suspect, my loss. Chunks of insight are embedded everywhere in \\"Collapse\\" and I probably missed another handful in the 20 or so pages I merely skimmed. Take the author's description of the comparative economics of oil and \\"hard-rock\\" mining: that's one of the best examples of how Diamond can deftly sketch the intricacies of a system while making it seem newly accessible to understanding.<br /><br />At its best, as it frequently is, \\"Collapse\\" gives us a new frame of reference for trying to make sense of what's happening in the world. But prepare yourself for a slog through some parts.
0688145078|5.0|I have bought numerous copies of this book to give to little boys who are about to have a new sibling.  I generally wrap it and include it as a shower gift, since they are present with their moms at the baby shower lots of the time.  So much do I enjoy this idea that I am about to order two more!  There is a similar book for girls, I'm a Big Sister.  I recommend this....it's a real hit!
0316172324|5.0|Blink's subject matter is completely different than Malcolm's first book, The Tipping Point, yet it shares the same wonderful flow of great story telling which has become Malcolm's signature writing style. Each chapter shares a compelling story which leads you to rethink and then think again about how you make decisions. After reading Blink I had to stop and question what may be behind some of my own snap judgements. <br /> <br />I had the wonderful opportunity to meet Mr. Gladwell at a book signing for Blink. After hearing him discuss some of the topics in his book, I'm ready to read Blink for a second time. I anxiously await the next topic he chooses to tackle for his third book and I highly recommend both Blink and The Tipping Point.
B00006CXSS|3.0|Hi everyone! <br />I just saw mostly all of the episodes by now. I am impressed about the high quality of almost everything: the actors are very good, the equipment looks very close to the original (as far as I can say), and the mood of war is transportated to the observer very well (or terribly, from the point of the observer). And even one typical \\"US-war-film\\"-stereotype is missing: the Germans are not ugly and bad... But unfortunatly, others remain: the Germans are stupid in every way of the word and love to run into enemy fire. I came to the question: what was the problem at all about Germany in 1939 to 1945? And what did US-troops learn from the Germans, that they still teach it at military-accademies?? They were just hordes of gun-food... Wow, I don't want to see how absolutly over-stupid the rest of Europes soldiers must have been, that it came this far with Europe...
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Who cares whether Arcade fire is an Indie band, whether they come from Montreal, whether they're the next big thing. Let's look at the music here. You have 10 songs, all pretty much dealing with the theme of loss or death. The band handles the subject in a Tori Amos-like abstract manner lyrically. The music is well played and shows promise for future albums. A strong debut for certain, but just misses being great. Perhaps many of the reviewers who are overly-positive about this album have few cds in their collections. I have over 2,000, and I've been an avid listener to music for over 25 years, so this album is just good, but not great. It shows promise, but the band will have to decide whether they're going to capitalize on this debut or not.<br /><br />The most interesting thing here is \\"Neighborhood #1,2,3 and 4\\". I haven't heard a song cycle similar to this on anything I've been buying for a number of years. These four songs hold the first half of the album together extremely well. I particularly liked how the band changed the rhythm, tempo, and meter of each part so that you can hear elements of each part in each song, but each one is still separate and unique from the other. I also enjoyed \\"Haiti\\" and \\"Rebellion\\". The other four songs, \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\", \\"Crown Of Love\\", \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"In The Backseat\\" were all okay, but not as strong as the other six tracks.<br /><br />Overall, this is a debut album from a new band that's worth taking a listen to. After repeated listening I felt they sounded like a blend of Modest Mouse and Siouxsie & The Banshees, both of whom I like. Lastly, I thought the design of the cd booklet was interesting--it's in the form of a funeral pamphlet!
B00005JNEW|2.0|I gave this film 2 stars because I like football.  I ordered this on InDemand Pay-Per-View.  Half way though the movie, I looked at my fiancee and said...do you remember \\"remember the titans.\\"  She just laughed.  The plot is the same thing minus the race issue.  Football team comes from behind in the finals while losing their best player. <br /> <br />Remember the titans?
0201721481|4.0|[Review of the 4th Edition]<br /><br />I really need to learn C++ some day, and I received a review copy of C++ Primer (4th Edition) by Stanley B. Lippman, Josee Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo.  If you're comfortable with lots of text, plenty of detail, and a more academic style of learning, this appears to be a good choice...<br /><br />Chapter List:<br /><br />Preface; Getting Started<br /><br />Part 1 - The Basics: Variables and Basic Types; Library Types; Arrays and Pointers; Expressions; Statements; Functions; The IO Library<br /><br />Part 2 - Containers and Algorithms: Sequential Containers; Associative Containers; Generic Algorithms;<br /><br />Part 3 - Classes and Data Abstractions: Classes; Copy Control; Overloaded Operations and Conversions<br /><br />Part 4 - Object-Oriented and Generic Programming: Object-Oriented Programming; Templates and Generic Programming<br /><br />Part 5 - Advanced Topics: Tools for Large Programs; Specialized Tools and Techniques; The Library; Index<br /><br />As you can probably tell, this book covers quite an array (no pun intended) of topics related to learning C++.  And knowing that it's now in its 4th edition, it has a track record that is solid enough to allocate resources for both the publisher and authors to keep it updated and fresh.  In the tech book world, two editions of a book is commendable.  Four is not often seen, so you can trust that the others who have gone before you have fared well.<br /><br />Each chapter is sprinkled with exercises to drive home the material being covered, as well as a summary and glossary of new terms at the end of each chapter.  In many ways, it reminds me of a textbook approach to learning a new language or technology.  I can imagine the teacher lecturing from chapter 4 and then assigning exercises 2, 4, and 5.  Unlike books that assume little programming background, this volume doesn't try and step you through setting up an IDE or anything.  It covers C++...  you need to get the IDE set up on your own.  Don't assume much in the way of handholding.<br /><br />To me, this would be a good \\"geek-level\\" book if you wanted to learn the language.  No fluff, no laughs, just learning.  Probably best for someone who already has a background with technology.  If you're more in the camp of C++ being your first language to learn (you're braver than I am!), this might be too much and too hardcore.<br /><br />Of course, your mileage may vary...on your own.

This ULTIMATE collection includes all her hits from the 80's to 2000's, sadly for many who got to met Minogue's music in her late years would be horrified by her early takes, ok many know that the 80's where cheesy but SAW production is the KING of cheesyness and corny.  So better if you skip the CD 01 and concentrate your energy on the CD 02, wich includes the early take BREATHE an imaginative track that was ahead of is time, CONFIDE IN ME a dramatic midtempo love song, SPINNING AROUND her comeback song, a pure new disco anthem, extremely chilling.

B00067ZONA|5.0|If you are a Genesis fan, you don't have to buy this compilation, because you already have it all. I think this is more oriented for people who doesn't know anything about Genesis and wants to meet their wonderful art. For that, this compilation is an awesome starting point, deserving not only five stars, but a million! But listen... a lots of things here are still missing. Doesn't matter how many compilations they release, if you want all Genesis greatest hits, so you have to buy THEIR ENTIRE DISCOGRAPHY! So, buy that first and get in love with their work, believe me, that will make you longing for more! Then, start looking for their albums, I recommend to get Nursery Crime, Selling England By The Pound, A Trick Of The Tail, Duke and We Can't Dance, first. All in all, a wonderful look in the group's career through the years, you will fall in love with them, get it now!
B0007P3582|4.0|hey guys: break it down for what it is.  I listen to eminem because of his lyrics.  I listen to 50 for the same reason.  This CD has been bashed and praised.  Listen to the entire CD, break down the tracks for the lyrical art that it is.  I picked it up at Target for 9.98.  Money well spent.
B0000029AP|4.0|\\"Toys in the Attic\\" and \\"Rocks\\" are both 4 star albums.  They are pure rock n roll at its greatest and raw form, with a classic feel. For simplicity, I have combined both reviews in this one review.  <br /> <br />There is not a bad song on either disc, although I would not call these albums masterpieces in the true sense of the word, hence four stars.  I would argue it is the only albums of theirs that you need. Frankly, I would give all their other albums two stars, although I realize that might make a lot of people gasp.  In my book, nothing else Aerosmith has done compares.  Other earlier works are not as solid and later works sound like an entirely different band.  Even the greatest hits albums fall short, to me.   <br /> <br />You want the greatest hits?  It is a double disc set, sold in seperate parts - Part 1: \\"Toys in the Attic\\" Part 2: \\"Rocks\\".
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Disney Studios will always be the pioneer in animation movies. The studios hold more classics in the art than any other.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the culmination of years and years of expirience.  This movie enbodies all the elements that a classic movie should have, great music, great plot, great art cinematography.  This would stay in the mind of many to come. The story of a brave young woman facing the beast and making him tame and loving, is just clever.  And the fantasy portrait here is meticulous and well crafted. *****FIVE STARS to this classic.
B00003CXTF|4.0|Excellent movie, great special effects, but the changing of DVDs in the middle is kind of plot-stopping.  Good movie to show in school, if possible.
B0000524CY|5.0|I was very reluctant to watch this movie for years because of the fact that I was terrified to watch it. I was scared of watching this film for the longest time. My girlfriend talked me into watching this. I loved the film. It really did scare me too. Just thinking back in history, when this movie was in the theaters, everyone walked out of the theater in dead silence after the movie was over. This made me even more interested in watching it. After watching this film, I too was left in dead silence. I had a very hard time falling asleep that night because of this film. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who is in for a good thrill!
B00003CXA4|5.0|The life of Gahndi should not be forgotten.  The acting in this movie is perfect and the messege and life of Gahndi comes through strong and clear in this brilliant piece of cinema magic. <br /> <br />This movie should be played in every school.  Every man, woman and child should see this movie.
B0007Y08I8|5.0|In a way, I'm embarrassed to be writing a review about this movie as I'm not sure I want the world to know I saw it.  But I can't wait for the DVD, it's one I'll keep in the closet.  But bar none this is the funniest movie I've ever seen. I actually thought I would have to get up and leave because I was laughing uncontrollably, so was the guy in front of me.  Everyone left the theater still laughing out loud as they walked down the street.  This is a keeper!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|Heard this at my sister's in Dublin recently. You are getting 18 gorgeous songs for $13.99 all sung by beautiful lilting Irish voices. I will definitly be buying this cd and I hear there is also a DVD.  I hope that they tour in the US soon because I'll be there. Slainte Ladies!
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot has struck again with this incredible CD. It is a very good collection of songs showing what Slipknot is really about. I love the anger that you feel surging right at you through every song on this CD. Joey is an incredible drummer as well. I am marveled at how he is able to work those drums like he does. The guitarists are marvels as well. This CD just contains everything that you are looking for in a metal CD. I'd recommend this CD to anyone anyday!
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is a film that everyone needs to see.  I would argue that childen should see it, too - those above say, the fifth grade, perhaps.  This is Steven Spielberg's golden movie.  He should be proud of what he has done.  What an achievement, and what pressure he must have been under to give this glimpse into history its proper treatment.  He pulled it off with flying colors and he will go down in history, as will this movie.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Following up his Death Row debut, \\"All Eyez on Me\\", 2Pac was just about to release this album right before he suddenly got killed.  This is the first album under his alias name \\"Makaveli.\\" \\"Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\\" was the first of the many albums released after his untimely death. <br /> <br />1. Intro: Bomb First (My 2nd Reply) (Featuring E.D.I. & Young Noble) - The first minute and 20 seconds is the intro, Nice beat, Pac, E.D.I., and Noble tear it up, dissing a bunch of rappers, Pac comes hard on the hook - 4.5/5 <br /> <br />2. Hail Mary (Featuring Kastro, Young Noble, & Prince Ital Joe) - Good beat, Everyone tears it up, hook is great - 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Toss It Up (Featuring K-Ci & JoJo) - Good beat, Pac spits two great verses...the 2nd one disses Dr. Dre, K-Ci and JoJo come good with their verses and the hook - 4.5/5 <br /> <br />4. To Live and Die in L.A. (Featuring Val Young) - Great beat, Pac rips it talking about growing up in Los Angeles, Val Young comes great on the hook....one of my favorite Pac tracks - 5/5 <br /> <br />5.

Against All Odds - Great beat, Pac disses the h*** out of Nas, Dr. Dre, Mobb Deep, Puffy Daddy...and more of his enemies, hook is great - 5/5 <br /> <br />Overall:   55.5 /60 <br /> <br />5 Stars <br /> <br />Pac came real strong with this album, its good from start to finish with barely any flaws.  Pac was in his prime when he released this album and \\"All Eyez on Me\\", if he was still alive, one can only wonder what other classic west coast gangsta music he would have came out with.....
B00000K31V|4.0|This film had the bones of a really good flick, unfortunately what we get is a little messy and under-acted, both Law and Leigh were miscast in their roles. The central idea was sound and interesting, imagine a future world were games become so real they obliterate the divide between reality and fantasy, were gamers arent sure any more what is real or not or even worse - have been conditioned by immersion in the game to behave chaotically in real life (strong implications of the effects of game/tv violence here). This is what (apparently) happens to the main characters as they jump from scene to scene after entering the virtual reality world of the game.  <br /> <br />The film itself is set in a world in which there is a pregnant tension surrounding the very idea of virtual reality games, where some people are concerned about the idea of the human race vegetating in fantasy and this theme is played out in the game the two characters play. They jump from scene to scene as secret agents working alternatively for the realists and the fantasists, the heroine plays the role of a hunted game designer in the game and there is an amusing undercurrent of Che Guavara style rebellion about their involvement in the game-sequences of the film. <br /> <br />The director chooses to leave the film open to interpretation, the ending is deliciously ambiguous (and the best part of it), unfortunately by then many viewers will have become befuddled and thrown off by the endless shifting between 'realities', the ending explains most of what you just saw nicely and throws in a vicious little twist at the very end. Not Cronenberg's best but unusual and thought provoking.
B00006RINF|5.0|I was first recommended to pick up this cd by a friend of mine who recommended it to me due to the fact that he knew I was a huge fan of Evanescence. So, I went and got this cd. I listened to it the first day I had it and fell in love with it. This CD did a fantastic job with the vocals and the band. I especially enjoyed the song \\"Comalies\\", which a majority of it is in Latin (which happens to be my favorite alternate language from english!) Buy this CD if you want a great CD that you will listen to for years to come!
B00005JMEW|2.0|Look, I don't know about this movie.  This movie is done well, dont get me wrong.  If you are a fan of violence and revenge than this is your movie, that is for sure.  I admire the artistic nature of the film and I think Tarantino is a unique artist, in general - but he is no genius.  Using violence to grab an audience, and shock to wow the audience, is nothing new or astonishing.  Strip out the over the top production and what are you left with?  This is a pretty vulgar movie that is a bit upsetting, really.  I am noticing a pattern in tarantino's work - an obsession with ultra violence and rape - and that is simply not a quality theme in my book.  This is pure entertainment, that borders along junk food for the brain.  Junk food tastes good, but has no nutritional value.    This is simply not my thing, but this could work for some people - ok, a lot of people.  It is fast paced, balls out, action for action in the most intense way - with a fabulous soundtrack and a general \\"coolness\\" that is captivating.  It gives respectable nods to kung fu classics and amps up the production to stellar form.      However, I dont find the witty dialogue from Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction present in this movie- and for me, that was Tarantino's saving grace in past movies.    I guess the point is, know what you are getting yourself into when you watch this movie.  I valued the unique direction of this movie, but this is not for everyone.  It wasn't for me.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|One word for the new album? Masterpiece. \\"Loch Ness\\" is 13 minutes long! The opening track-\\"Judas Rising\\" is unrelenting and so is this LONG awaited reunion of Halford and Judas Priest. They could have given us a \\"Turbo\\" re-tread or a \\"Painkiller\\" sequel, but Priest has given us a classic metal album (probably the best Metal album period since \\"Painkiller\\"- ) Anyway, Priest fans old (like me! Fan since 1982!)and young will not be disapointed. This album rocks and will kick your teeth in! I advise to listen to it with Sony headphones to get the entire effect. All the Metal bands of today (with nothing to say or sing about) owe everything to the original creators of Metal music-Long Live PRIEST!
B0006B2A2E|4.0|I was haunted long after the movie ended.  I can't help but watch this movie and ponder just how important it is to cherish the good of your relationship.  To always remember why you are with the person you love.  Time and life's hardships can bring you down and destroy the innocence of love, but as long as you hold that love above the mess, you will prevail, happily. <br /> <br />This is Jim Carrey's best movie, to date... by far.  Not that his other movies aren't good.  This just takes the cake for me.  I had respected him, as an actor, ever since Man on the Moon and this just confirms it all.  He is good.  His acting was honest and I can't help but feel he identified with the role quite a bit.  He was too engaging not to be emotionally attached.  Great job and a great movie.
B000050FEN|3.0|Imagine: there's a gun to your head. What values are expendable? How much hope and dignity would you surrender? That's the challenged posed by Director David Fincher and Screenwriter Andrew Walker's 1995 gun, called *SE7EN*.<br /><br />*SE7EN* suffers enough flaws to fall short of the thematically profound film its five-star fans want it to be. Nevertheless, it's that rarest of slasher-thrillers: moody, engaging, and mainstream.<br /><br />Of course it is. As director David Fincher's second theatrical outing, *SE7EN* appeals to the industrial-gothic-punk culture dominating early to mid 1990's America. There are the obvious atmospheric giveaways: like the prominence of Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, and Gravity Kills in the soundtrack; bleak and decaying set design right out of Tool, Stabbing Westward, and *The Downward Spiral*, and the incessant but fashionable harping upon the darkness of humanity. Less obvious commercial appeal includes the sheer nihilism and anarchy in the dialogue, as well as a multitude of BDSM images and themes. People ranging from H.R. Geiger to Marilyn Manson would find themselves at home in this picture.<br /><br />Within this trendy (but well sculpted) atmosphere, Fincher paints a picture of religious vigilantism. To paraphrase comedian George Carlin, serial killer \\"John Doe\\" does not have pet peeves; he has major psychotic hatreds. The film builds around his campaign to take these hatreds out upon seven people, each of whom seems \\"guilty\\" of committing a deadly sin. Doe takes the deadly part a little too far, and so his punishments severely outweigh the \\"crime\\". And if murdering people because they're too fat or too beautiful wasn't petty enough, Doe gleefully kills them in a manner reflecting their sin, and usually slow and painful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film itself seems to agree with Doe, and that's one of several problems preventing *SE7EN* from being anything other than a slasher film.<br /><br />The filmmakers repeat one of Oliver Stone's core mistakes from *Natural Born Killers*--they fall in love with their villain. From the beginning *SE7EN* stacks the audience in John Doe's favor by making most of his victims repulsive--a fat man, a prostitute, a lawyer--playing on our own prejudices to excuse his spectacularly sadistic actions. Furthermore, the film's protagonists come across as morally and intellectually impotent in the face of John Doe; in the car scene towards the end of the film, the killer dismantles the detectives' arguments with ease, even as I sat in the theater refuting every one of his points in my head. Finally, the surprise ending leaves little doubt that, yes, John Doe is the man with the plan; rendering all other people victims.<br /><br />This notion of the human flock doomed before the wolves is no slip. In another mistake repeated from Stone's *NBK*, *SE7EN* becomes the monster it portrays. It browbeats the audience with nihilism, harping incessantly on the futility of preventing evil. In fact, *SE7EN* goes so far as to portray heroic and idealistic protagonists who are destroyed by the villain; only the apathetic survive. It revels in clever and stylish crime scenes, enjoying the carnage as much as John Doe. And with the type of victims portrayed, the audience can enjoy it too. By the end, with our heroes defeated and the audience staring into the symbolic setting sun of death, I was stunned. Not by any profound revelation about humanity, but by the story's blinkered pessimism.<br /><br />Look, I like dark art such as *The Downward Spiral* and the *The Wall* as much as the next guy. Partly because those albums had complex hearts or themes. That's *SE7EN's* final and most fatal obstacle to being profound: there's no developed message or truth here. The religious and literary themes dress up the plot and characters, but convey only the most trivial and disagreeable message that people should be damned for being themselves. There is nothing profound about killing people for being people.<br /><br />Of course, none of this should come as a surprise from a director who allegedly wanted to make *Alien 3* look like a snuff film in space. But damn if David Fincher can't make a slasher film look good. Fincher has an unparalleled grasp on camera angles, lighting, and set design. The foot chase between Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey actually excited me, and was one of the more intense action scenes I've seen on film. Fincher achieved an atmospheric soundtrack as well, and Howard Shore's score works well with the dripping, peeling sets and the techno-industrial tunes. Despite the film's overall inhumanity, every scene bristles with little human touches, from sleeping on couches to preparing for work to getting stuck with an apartment too close to an elevated train. Altogether, *SE7EN* shows off the lessons Fincher learned from *Alien 3* and applied to later films.<br /><br />And while I'm at it, I gotta give props to the screenwriter. I sure didn't think of this story idea. The whole deadly sin motif and their murderous mirrors gave this thriller a spark of originality if nothing else. The story also suspends belief well with the details of police work and characters. The exchanges between newcomer Detective Mills and members of his Hell's Kitchen precinct provides plenty of darkly amusing personality sparring.<br /><br />The actors certainly helped this along. I believe Brad Pitt was an energetic cop with a chip on his shoulder. And Morgan Freeman was Detective Somerset in all his methodical glory. Even bit characters liven up the scenes and compare or contrast well with the lead characters.<br /><br />These production values as much as the cultural trappings make *SE7EN* mainstream, at least back in 1995. I also call it mainstream because the film isn't all that bloody or gore-riddled. And with a religious psychopath portrayed as an anti-heroic enforcer, plenty of theists, liberals, and conservatives can enjoy this film. Indeed, *SE7EN* can probably take credit for legitimizing slasher films if nothing else.<br /><br />*SE7EN* entertains me in the end, though I have to be in the right mood to put up with its trendy nihilism. As any sort of literary fiction--expressing an underlying heart or an important truth about people--the film falls short. Taken as what it is--a mainstream slasher film artifact of mid-nineties American culture--*SE7EN* stands on its own.<br /><br />DVD NOTES:<br /><br />Looks great, sounds great.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|First off, before anyone reviews this album, they should listen to the album at least 10 times and digest all of it.  I personally have listened to the whole thing possibly 20 times since buying it last Thursday.  With that said, the Mars Volta step up their musical assault on this 77 minute opus and leave the listener only looking forward and not back on their previous records the Tremulent EP and De-Loused in the Comatorium.  This is a totally different band than what appeared on those two records in the sense that they have finally found a definitive sound and have an air of confidence about themselves.  Also, as a sidenote, many have bashed the incessante use of sound effects between songs as being too long and too stupid.  Did it ever occur to anyone that this album is based off a diary the late Jeremy Ward (who did sound effects for the Mars Volta until his 2003 death) and since it was found by Jeremy, it would only be fitting to display something that he was very good at everywhere on this record.  The ambient noise and weird sounds I feel are a way for the band to pay tribute to their lost bandmate.  Anyway, on with the review.    (supposed to be track one).Frances The Mute-Not in fact on this CD at all but was supposed to be the first song on the album but was cut because of time constraints.  Only the lyrics to the song appear in the lyrics book accompanying the album.  I haven't personally think it's a great track that all fans should purchase in any way possible.  1.Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus-the 43 second acoustic intro will likely throw you off before you are thrown into a frenzy of funk/salsa/classic rock with lyrics mostly in Spanish.  You know you're in for one great ride of an album when you can even hear orchestral noises going on underneath all the madness.  Guitar solos are aplenty on this song as well as all the other songs on the album and the song really picks up after the second chorus only to segue into a jammy jazz section.  The song ends around the ten minute mark but outro noise goes on for 3 minutes until...  2.The Widow-This is the shortest song the Volta has ever made in the sense of actual music and is a rather strong ballad.  It's choruses are really uplifting and has a bridge to die for including an awesome guitar solo and trumpet solo courtesy of guest trumpeteer Flea (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers).  Was released as a single as a 3:30 edit which cuts off the two and half minutes of ambient noise that appears on the album leading into.......  3.L'Via L'Viaquez-This song's fusion of salsa and spaced out funk is totally addictive.  From the intro guitar solo (played uncharacteristically by John Frusciante of the Chili Peppers who also plays the second solo on the song) you know you're in for a rocking good time.  The song basically follows a format (shocking for the Volta) of space funk verses balanced out by slow and sexy salsa choruses.  Prior to the third chorus, drummer Jon Theodore plays sumthin like a 15 second drum solo.   After each chorus, the listener is treated to a guitar solo and on the outro a guitar solo and piano solo fuse together before fading off into the sunset amid tons of ambient noise which only leads into.....  4.Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore-5 more minutes of ambience!!!!  Oh joy!!!  This song is a little bit overkill on the ambience.  This is basically a 5 maybe 6 minute song extended to 13 minutes.  Alone, it would suck.  In the context of the album though, it works.  The first four minutes of ambiene sound like the intro to Televators offa De-Loused except it's hyper extended.  At about the four minute mark, a trumpet can be heard along with song light acoustic strumming which wouldn't sound out of place in the Kill Bill movies.  At about 4:30, the song itself starts off in its haunting acousticness.  The band is backed by violins and other orchestral instruments on this mostly acoustic piece which rocks out around the 8:15 mark only to fizzle out at the 9:00 mark in which ambient noise then builds up to the albums centerpiece...  5-12.Cassandra Gemini-A 30 minute opus stretched out over 8 tracks with enough twists and turns to make one's head explode.  Guitar solos are extremely abundant along with the constant backing of the orchestra which includes a flute on this song and a saxophone solo which lasts approximately 2-3 minutes.  Even a shredding bass solo occurs somewhere towards the end of the 7th track.  Overall, this song is extremely excited and mostly fast paced and will likely not put you to sleep.  Ambient pauses and jazzy jamming only give way to insane guitar freakouts and excellent singing.  The song climaxes beautifully and ends with the same acoustic strummings that gave way to Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus.      Overall, this is a great piece of work that needs to be digested before it is judged.  If you've never listened to the Mars Volta before you should listen to their albums chronologically and one you feel that you've fully wrapped your mind around each individual album, move onto the next one.  It's what I did and it has made the Mars Volta my biggest current musical influence.  Still, this is a great piece of work for the already initiated fan and is soo off the wall in its creativity and blatant disregard for the mainstream yet it is being embraced as this technically 12 song but really 1 song album was number 4 this week on the billboard charts.  That's my two cents.  Go buy this great piece of work now and check out one of their shows.
B000683VI4|3.0|Although I'm a sucker for a good love story, and cry at the slightest thing, this movie just didn't do it for me. I still enjoyed it, and I'm glad I own it on DVD, but in all honesty, I have to say, this time I preferred the book. Normally, I don't, I prefer the film & don't like the book, but this time, I definitely preferred the book. My eyes constantly drifted to the clock as well, despite enjoying the movie.<br /><br />It could also be I'm not that keen on Ryan Gosling either. He's so emotionless in this role, and he's in great danger of turning into another Clive Owen. I didn't like him in Murder By Numbers either. I wouldn't have changed Rachel McAdams at all, but Ryan - I might have changed him if I'd been the director. I can't think who mind you! (I can't get over the fact that Rachel McAdams was also in Mean Girls, playing Regina George - she has great versatility as an actress, and I really didn't recognise her, despite Mean Girls being one of my favourite movies).<br /><br />Plus, I disagree with the quote on the DVD cover, that's it's the most romantic movie since Titanic. I'm a big fan of the Titanic, and have seen a few rom-coms/romantic movies in my time, but this isn't the most romantic. Although I felt for the characters, I found myself really not caring about them in the slightest. Which is so unlike me!<br /><br />It's never really mentioned in the film either how many years Allie & Noah are, before finally meeting again. I think it's seven years in the movie, but I'm sure it's maybe 10 years in the book. I liked how they aged the characters slightly, it was quite sweet! (Although they did it backwards - the \\"after 7 years Allie and Noah\\" scenes were shot first and then the crew/cast went on a Christmas break. Ryan Gosling had to lose the beard and 20lbs he'd had as the older Noah and come back to play the young Noah. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were rather shy and unsure around each other in the \\"after 7 years\\" scenes but were more comfortable together in the young Allie and Noah scenes.)<br /><br />There is a sequel to the book, called The Wedding, which I recently read - I'm working my way through all the Nicholas Sparks books at the moment. However, I'm very doubtful that there will be a sequel to the film, as the ending is quite different from the book. I'm not going to give much away, but Noah features a lot in the sequel . . . OK, I'll shut up, otherwise I'll reveal too much, and get a slap on the wrist from Amazon. But I'll be really surprised if they make a sequel to the film. There are plenty of other Nicholas Sparks books they should be making into movies, including A Bend In The Road, The Guardian, Nights In Rodanthe and The Rescue.<br /><br />I found myself constantly thinking of what should be coming next in the film as to what happened next in the book, I think that was another of the downfalls to the movie. If you've read the book, you'll know what happens. I think if I'd watched the movie without reading the book first, I would have enjoyed the movie more. I've seen A Walk To Remember and Message In A Bottle, and both times, I read the book after seeing the movie for the first time.<br /><br />I haven't seen a bad review for this movie, although my review seems to be giving it less stars than everyone else. My boyfriend, who HATES romantic movies and to prove this, I quote: \\"I must stress to you my belief in that the 'romantic comedy' is pretty much the worst creation of mankind ... the romcom is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old, same old crap.\\" (That'll be me then.) I'm not going to lump him in with the other hard nuts out there, who like their films with blood, guts & nudity - he just pretends he likes that kinda stuff, he's a real softie at heart! I'm still shocked that he liked the movie better than me, and gave it a better review.<br /><br />I do recommend you see this movie, but I do have to say that I prefer A Walk To Remember (even if my boyfriend does want to get into Mandy Moore's pants) and Message In A Bottle. Think I can get him to watch Message In A Bottle?! Perhaps not, I bawl at that.t I prefer A Walk To Remember (even if my boyfriend does want to get into Mandy Moore's pants) and Message In A Bottle.

B00005JLTR|5.0|Why in the heck is this movie not out on dvd yet?? I've been waiting for years to own the disc!! It's such a classic love story of my time and I will never forget all of it's tender moments. I first saw it at it's premiere when I was 17 in Hollywood. After that I owned the music LP, now today the cd. I think the movie to this day is still as great as it was back then. Can you imagine hearing it come in on 5.1 surround? Aw[...] nice!!  Come on now, A Star Is Born fans are waiting!!!
B00004XMS0|4.0|This DVD has the collection of the 4 major Batman feature films.<br /><br />Batman(1989)- this is a great movie. Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as the Dark knight and Jack Nickelson is great as the Joker. Tim Burton directs beautifully, his dark style brings to life the darkness of the Batman legend. This film does a superb job of establishing Batman as a dark and very complex hero.  Also, Nickelson uses his dark comidic style to make the Joker an unforgetable villan. While not as great as Batman Returns, this first movie helps develop the Batman mythos that would result in Batmania. (9 of 10)<br /><br />Batman Returns (1992)- This is the best superhero film of all time no matter what Spiderman 2 fans think.  This movie is extremely dark, which reflects the psyche of its characters.  Keaton is back as Batman and this time around does a better job of portraying both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego.  Michelle Pfiefer is amazing as the sexy Catwoman.  Her relationship with Batman is the most intriguing of any superhero genre film.  Danny is almost unrecognizable as the evil Penguin.  The movie establishes his story very effectively.  In addition, Tim Burton is back as director, and produces the best film of his career.  This film continues the dark style from the first movie and takes it much further exploring the psychology of each character.<br /><br />As a side note did you know that Robin was written into the script of both Batman and Batman Returns, but was later dropped.  If you notice the Batman Returns action figures include Robin. (10 of 10)<br /><br />Batman Forever (1995)- No Tim Burton and no Michael Keaton means close but no cigar.  This film lacks the gritiness of the earlier films.  Val Kilmer's Batman has no depth or complexity.  Carey and Jones are too over the top as the villans and Nicole Kidman plays a poor man's Vikki Vale.  Also, O'Donnell is much too old to play Robin. The writers should have made Robin a cool young sidekick like Tim Drake to contrast with Batman's dark side.  Finally, Schumacher was a horrendous pick as director. He does not have respect for the Batman mythos.  For example, near the end of the movie he makes sure too get good money shots of Batman's ass.  At best this movie can be considered mediocre. (5 of 10)<br /><br />Batman and Robin(1997)- one of the worst films of all time.  Only a diehard Batman fan like myself can find enjoyment in the abomination.  Schumacher ruins the Batman series with his over the top style and with the castings of Clooney and O'Donnell.  Clooney, never that great an actor, is lost playing Batman and O'Donnell succeeds it making Robin seem like a Frisco citizen.  However, the worst things about this movie are that first Batgirl(Barbara Gordon) has suddenly become Barbara Wilson Alfred's niece and secondly a great character like Bane was underutilized as Ivey's brainless muscle.  This again shows utter disregard on the part of Schumacher for the history and mythos of the Batman character. (1 of 10)<br /><br />I wish that Burton and Keaton would have taken part it all the Batman films.  Also, I would have liked that Catwoman had been saved for another Batman feature and not wasted on the awful Halle Berry flick.  Hopefully, Christian Bale can return Batman to his rightfull place as a dark and complex hero in Batman Begins.  In conclusion it is wiser to collect these movies seperately instead of coping $40 for this setntrast with Batman's dark side.  Finally, Schumacher was a horrendous pick as director.

B0000DIJO2|5.0|I forced myself to buy some good music DVD and I'm feeling lucky that somehow I selected this DVD.. This was the first time I was hearing BEE GEES music. I liked it so much that I played it every night when I went to sleep in my CD player and even in the morning when I get up it used to be playing the songs.  <br /> <br />The sound quality was great and all the songs played by the BEE GEES are good. One of the last concerts where all the three brothers were together. I liked it so much that I even brought their ONE FOR ALL concert DVD. That will be a good addition to your collection. Also I brought a bunch of BEE GEES CDs from AMAZON. I even brought SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER DVD (I'm a crazy guy now) <br /> <br />BEE GEES are simply great. I STRONGLY recommend this DVD.
068987474X|2.0|This book is very simple and repetitive.  The title says it all.  It could be useful, however, if you are the type who gets fixated and obsesses about guys who are not really available or interested in you.  If so, you may want to do some deeper work on self love, which is the key to finding a partner who truly cherishes you.  Check out my Amazon list, \\"So You'd Like to Find a Love Relationship...\\" for some great books that can help you on that path.
B00005Y7PS|2.0|I'm rating it two stars not because this album is that bad, but because, comparing it to the other Tony Martin's Sabbath albums, this is the second worst by a large margin (\\"losing\\" this distinction only to FORBIDDEN) Production values are high, but the songs and riffs are simply not memorable at all, they all mix with each other, the songs have no identity, it seems Iommi was really uninspired.<br /><br />Anyway, for such a low price and if you're a Sabbath completist, this is a good buy.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is just that, Spectacular. A movie to be watched over and over again, I can honestly say this is one of my top 10 favorite movies what with the perfect cast/acting/script, no wonder this won \\"Best Picture\\". A movie that makes you look closer...
B000002UAC|5.0|The first album I ever got was Something New, Something New, The Beatles (an American release).  It was at Christmas and I was five years old.  From that time on I was hooked and a dedicated Beatle fan.  But one of my favorite Beatles releases is With the Beatles.  With the Beatles is one of the ultimate rock n' roll recordings; a perfect blend of original songs and classic covers, a definitive expression of the original Beatles' sound.  Every single song on here is good and very difficult to pick favorites so I won't even try (I will say that their rendition of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" is better than the original).  Words simply cannot express the greatness and quality of the music presented here.  With the Beatles is to be heard over and over again, letting it speak for itself.  This is truly the early Beatles at the top of their game.  If With the Beatles does not get you singing along and your foot tapping, then you're musical appreciation is hopeless.   <br />(Some helpful advice...when collecting Beatles recordings get only the British releases).
B000667FNI|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  Side one is the American Beauty you already love, remastered in new 128bit stereo...it sounds better than ever, better than the new remaster in the box set.  Side 2 is a DVD with 2 brief interviews with Mickey and Bobby.  There are some great photos too.  But the main attraction of the set is the new 5.1 Surround Mix on Side 2.  YOU NEED A DVD COMPATIBLE WITH DOLBY OR DTS 5.1 TO HEAR THIS MIX.  There are so many lost harmonies, guitar licks, and percussion that Mickey has added back in that were originally recorded and left out of the stereo mix.  It's like listening to a whole new American Beauty with the band right in your living room.  If you have never heard a 5.1 surround mix CD, you are missing out!  I can't describe the incredible difference.  Do yourself a favor, get this if you have the equipment to play it.
B000001FFR|5.0|This is what happens when Metal and Great songs meet....A solid album in every way,..Performance, song Structure, Melody and High amounts of energy...If you like Metal or are just a Rocker like myself..you can't go wrong with this one.
B00007LVBN|5.0|In terms of becoming an overnight sensation after having worked with some notable success in the music business, you are hard pressed to find a better example than Carole King. Having written some early hits as \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\\" in the late 1960's King got the chance to record and sing her own songs. The result was \\"Tapestry,\\" an album that basically everybody had to have (Think \\"Rumors\\" or \\"Thriller\\" if you are not old enough to remember). \\"Tapestry\\" was on the charts for over six years and when we talk about singer-songwriters this album is the fountainhead for the genre.<br /><br />\\"Tapestry\\" is an album that announces it's presence with authority with the opening pounding piano chords of \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" and ends with a truly soulful \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.\\" In between there was the beautiful simplicity of \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"Way Over Yonder,\\" and \\"You've Got A Friend.\\" Fans of \\"The Gilmore Girls\\" will recognize \\"Where You Lead,\\" and will probably miss hearing King sing it with her daughter. This was really the first album after the Beatles broke up where you there were a whole bunch of hit singles to be found: in addition to all of the above you can throw in \\"It's Too Late\\" as well. \\"Tapestry\\" remains a simple, classic album of pop music that made pretty much every album that followed it suffer in comparison.<br /><br />It is a bit funny to think that to help sell the CD version of one of the best selling albums of all time someone thought there was a need to have bonus tracks. Now, as a general rule, I like bonus tracks on albums from the Sixties. However, this particular album ends with \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\\" and today's generation should be able to enjoy the sense of completion that provided to listening to \\"Tapestry\\" the same way we all did way back when. There is such a thing as preserving our musical heritage, not that there is anything wrong with either the unreleased \\"Out in the Cold\\" and an unreleased live solo piano version of \\"Smackwater Jack\\" from 1973. But niether can improve on the original ending.leased live solo piano version of \\"Smackwater Jack\\" from 1973. But niether can improve on the original ending.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|First, the dualdisc version is pretty easy to copy, have you tried it to tell stuff like that, I was able to rip both the CD side and the DVD side, I don't know what software you use but you should upgrade them. Another thing, the DVD side is different from the DVD that you can purchase with the deluxe edition. It's not the same thing, dualdisc goal is to achieve a better sounding edition of the songs on the DVD side(here 48khz instead of 44khz for redbook CD).
B0006GAZFI|2.0|I lived in Japan for three years and can tell you that even there the made-in-Japan versions are more expensive than the CDs they import from abroad.<br />Japanese versions differ in two ways.  First, the liner notes include translated lyrics in addition to the original (even when the English words are omitted in other versions).  Often the Japanese versions have a page or two that gives a background introduction to the artist and their genre.  The assumption is that these Japanese buyers did not have the benefit of growing up listening to these Anglophone artists on the radio, so they aren't familiar with the whole scene.<br />Providing these expanded liner notes adds the cost of the disc, so as compensation the Japanese releases frequently include a bonus track not found on other versions.  In this case &quot;The Stranger&quot;.  (&quot;All by Myself&quot; on Celine Dion's 'All The Way' GH, &quot;Is there Any Love in Your Heart&quot; on Lenny Kravitz's GH etc.)<br />In Japan, the price difference may be in the neighbour of 4 or 5 dollars extra to get the domestic version rather than buying the imported version.<br />In North America the situation is reversed.  The version without the Japanese liners notes is the domestic version, while the one with Japanese liner notes (and extra song) is the import.  But the price gap becomes much more extreme.  From this side of the pacific, buying non-Japanese is even cheaper and buying Japanese is even more expensive.<br /><br />While it is true that most imports cost more, it's much more so the case with the Japanese release as these were more expensive to begin with because of the bilingual liner notes - a feature that most shoppers outside of Japan aren't going to find too useful.<br />Notwithstanding albums or compilations that were never put on CD except in Japan, buying a Japanese import is a complete waste of money - unless you desperately want that special bonus song.<br />Anyway, I'm supposed to talking about Billy Joel.  This collection is pretty good; in fact I'd give it 4/5 stars, were it not for the price - arguably it IS the &quot;Very Best&quot; - but do your wallet a favour and get the domestic version or better yet get the 42 song 3-disc collection (Australian Import) Greatest Hits 1, 2,&amp;3 for only $34.  You get all the tracks seen here on the VBof (except &quot;Scandinavian Skies&quot; and &quot;Don't Ask Me Why&quot;) - PLUS 25 MORE SONGS not seen here.Joel.

078322799X|5.0|\\"When a man's jawbone drops off, it's time to reassess the situation.\\"<br /><br />The Frighteners.  I bought this on Widescreen VHS my freshman year in college solely based on the cover (and Zemeckis's reputation at the time), and it was the saving grace for keeping my sanity.  After going through a massive (on my end) breakup, struggling with Women in Literature (I eventually pulled an A-), and learning far too late about the effects of alcohol on my friends, I would sit down and watch this movie every single day.  Not all the way through.  Parts of it.  Usually the first hour.  The location shots, especially, reminded me there was more on this globe of ours I was shutting out.<br /><br />\\"My body is a roadmap of pain.\\"<br /><br />The atmosphere of this film is incredibly spooky.  I'm not quite sure how they did it because I think this was before the Digital Intermediate was popular.  The entire film is desaturated of a lot of red and yellows, while the green and blues are favored.  Not so much as the Matrix films, of course... Frighteners is essentially Corpus Aeotearoa, if possible, as if created from the light of New Zealand.  I love the light of the forest when Fox's character was slightly younger.  Almost orange in hue.<br /><br />\\"You are violating my territorial bubble.\\"<br /><br />This film has amazing effects in it.  The ghosts look realistic, the tunnels of death are beautiful to watch, and all the sets are brilliant.  I wish I knew how they did the church hospital scene, where Frank Bannister turns from the burnt down present into the shiny, slick past, in one shot.  Probably motion control and plates, but I like to think they used ye olde fashioned ways...<br /><br />And Michael J. Fox ... in the climactic scene ... supernal ...

WELL, WHEN JAY-Z WAS IN THE MIX HE HAD A LOT OF HATERZ TOO. ANYWAY ENOUGH OF TALKING ABOUT THE HATERZ OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. I THINK THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY GOOD FOR 50 CENT SECOND SOLO ALBUM. SONGS LIKE \\"SKI MASK WAY\\", \\"RYDER MUSIC\\", \\"POSITION OF POWER\\", \\"IN MY HOOD\\" ARE JUST SOME OF THE TIGHT SONGS ON THE ALBUM.  THE THING IS I AM A UNDERGROUND LISTENER BUT OPEN MY EARS TO COMMERCIAL RAP TOO. I JUST HAD TO WRITE A GOOD REVIEW ON THE ALBUM BECAUSE I SAW THE OTHERS REVIEWERS HAD HATE IN THEIR BLOOD. PLEASE DO NOT \\"HATE AND CONGRATULATE\\". COP THE ALBUM. ONE.
B00000DCHE|5.0|Pre 1981, these songs may have been in the proverbial attic.  They soon became some of Billy's most popular tunes.  Like other reviewers here, I am not one who enjoys live recordings.  They tend to lack depth, and I just get annoyed with the volume control on audience cheers - intense solo: make the crowd cheer...now!  Bands always record audience noise for obvious reasons as it's a whole part of the live feel.<br /><br />This crowd cheering that occurs on Captain Jack is the most humorous, and I almost feel like it *wasn't* mixed, too much anyways.  Joel begins playing a fabulous piano intro and the crowd gets louder when it thinks it recognizes the song, and then quickly dies down...the piano solo keeps going, building up, and then he breaks out into Captain Jack.  The crowd goes wild!  The crowd also goes wild after \\"...and you just sit at home and m---...\\" and also after \\"smoke your pot.\\"<br /><br />There are at least five (!) sound engineers who worked on Billy's concerts during these years, and they did an exemplary job of capturing the music and the crowds...and it shows.  The mixing (re-mixing done by Phil Ramone, et al.) between tracks in the small venue and the large arenas is so well done, you feel as if 1) the entire album is done in one show, or 2) the crowd magically dissipates or recrudesces without being annoying.  It's very well done.<br /><br />To the people who think The Ballad of Billy the Kid is self-reflexive, the answer is actually a Billy who tends bars in Oyster Bay.  Don't believe me?  Read the extremely interesting liner notes that Mr. Joel wrote himself for each song.  I have never seen *any* musician take the time out to do this.  He also writes a small paragraph for each of his 21 crew members.  As if that's not enough, there is a short essay on why Billy recorded this, and a picture of Billy when he was probably 14 years old.  There is also a lengthy note from Mr. Ramone himself, plus lyrics.<br /><br />The album cover is classic, with the piano man throwing light on an old dusty piano, designed by Paula Scher who became somewhat of a visual arts celebrity herself in the 1990s.  You can buy her book \\"Make It Bigger\\" online.<br /><br />Considering I don't even have the remastered version of this album (I'm sure that one has more goodies), this album sure packs a punch!<br /><br />To conclude in Billy's own words: \\"...invite your cranky neighbors over and play this record as loud as you can.\\"an old dusty piano, designed by Paula Scher who became somewhat of a visual arts celebrity herself in the 1990s.

B00008OLYN|5.0|Sometimes I feel like this must be my favorite album of all time.<br /><br />There is no other album I've heard that has such a beautiful mood to it.  The emotion this has is unmatchable.  The perfect album for sitting in your room while it rains hard outside.<br /><br />Yes, it is a lot different from other Opeth.  That's great though, every piece of work they did was perfect, the only possible downfall was that Still Life and Blackwater Park were a little too alike.  It's really nice to see them splitting their work into seperate components like they did with Deliverance and Damnation.  Both of them are classics and no matter what Opeth does afterwards will remain so.<br /><br />Also, this and Deliverance's use of keyboards/mellotrons was a GREAT idea.  I hope they ask Steve Wilson to produce their next album too.<br /><br />If this album has ANY problems, they actually end up enhancing the fallible, emotional, human quality it has.<br /><br />Guitar work isn't as complex as Morningrise, but most things aren't... Akerfeldt is still one of the most creative and talented guitarists, as is Peter Lindgren, they learned restraint while at points still showing off their impressive speed/complexity.<br /><br />Opeth has grown again and there's every sign that they will continue to do so, all of their albums are equally amazing but this just might be my favorite.<br /><br />Akerfeldt said on the new DVD that the next album might have a concept, possibly occult and black metal influenced.  And it'll be back to the heavy/soft contrast.  Should be interesting to see how it turns out.  I would say I \\"can't wait\\", but the albums they've put out already have pretty much limitless replay value.  I'm contented.
B000000H6D|4.0|From what I understand, I picked up (in an American store) the European version of this record.  Despite the fact that I loathe when people list every track (the tracklist is provided anyway!), I will do so since you cannot find it on this site.<br /><br />1. Machine Screw - \\"Easy, easy!\\" and then 40 seconds of you know what with lots of hydraulics, steam, pumping, and echoing pipes reminiscent of Aerosmith's Water Song (prelude to Janie's Got A Gun).  Humorous, and not something to play loudly when the parents are around.<br /><br />2. Christian Woman - heard a radio edit...this and Black Nº.1 got me into TON while driving around the 285/C-470 exchange in the foothills of Colorado.  All three parts are one track.<br /><br />3. Black Nº.1<br /><br />4. Fay Wray Come Out and Play - I think one of the band members is making the weird bird calls in the background.  This track is awesome!  Tribal, a group of men chanting and praying before a sacrifice of a woman to a dinosaur of some sort...to appease some god.  With rain effects.  I love this track.<br /><br />5.  Kill All the White People - The song lacks a lot at first, but the bridge is cool; with headphones, you can hear an argument (or two or three!) in the background.  That makes this song pretty amusing.  \\"Kill Em All!\\" (hello Metallica)  The track ends with one voice saying \\"Yo' violence ain't necessary\\" and a gutteral response \\"word.\\"<br /><br />6. Summer Breeze<br /><br />7. Set Me On Fire - one of the coolest rounds, and by TON no less!  Sing along.<br /><br />8. Dark Side of the Womb - Strange.  Baby sounds, then a possible sequel to Machine Screw<br /><br />9. We Hate Everyone - \\"TV Interviews, Free Publicity, Increase Record Sales\\" spoken with deep, slow, aggravating baritone.  This track is pretty intense and humorous.  Again, the main song is lacking but the middle section is very very cool.  One of the best guitar riffs, here, that really builds up steam.  Should've been a song itself.  Sadly, it reverts to the lackluster \\"We Hate Everyone!\\"<br /><br />10. Bloody Kisses<br /><br />11. 3.0.I.F. - car effects, weird looped vocalizations...builds up with heavy reverb, the words \\"negative\\" repeated over and over, and someone saying \\"[unintelligible] Jesus Christ\\" backwards, culminating in a car accident<br /><br />12. Too Late: Frozen - Steele's \\"F*** you\\" laugh at the beginning is classic.  This song is pretty decent, but for the third time I love the middle section better.  Steele sings with an icy cold shivery effect.  Good stuff.<br /><br />13. Blood & Fire - again, the middle section is the most impressively composed area.  The way Steele speaks here is hilarious.  Silly French accents (speaks some French here, too), and British English.  It almost sounds like he's going bleh bleh bleh, in parts, but he's actually saying stuff.<br /><br />14. Can't Lose You - Pitch bended song apparently formed around a (possibly edited) John Lennon loop...very cool.  This is the ultimate tip-o-the-hat to the Beatles.  Sitars courtesy of George Harrison.  Repetitive lyrics courtesy John Lennon.  \\"Everybody smokes pot\\" loop (re-recorded by TON, and I can't make out the second line they say) courtesy Lennon/McCartney.  Elapsed time of 2:28, you'll hear Steele's finger-mouth pop.  Remaining time of 1:30, you'll hear John Lennon's voice singing in the right ear, possibly: \\"Say those words, a little deceiving, all the while the girl he was dating, feeling.\\"  Just like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" has Steele whispering \\"suck my d***\\" subliminally, this track has \\"smoke pot\\" among other unintelligible lines whispered throughout most of the second half.<br /><br />4.5 stars.  Had this record included \\"Suspended in Dusk,\\" I would've given it a perfect five stars.  By far the most gothic album I've ever heard, with amazing mixing, superb creativity, and excellent art design.  Type O was supposed to always be this, in my opinion.  I hope they come back this direction..I.F. - car effects, weird looped vocalizations...builds up with heavy reverb, the words \\"negative\\" repeated over and over, and someone saying \\"[unintelligible] Jesus Christ\\" backwards, culminating in a car accident    12.

Remaining time of 1:30, you'll hear John Lennon's voice singing in the right ear, possibly: \\"Say those words, a little deceiving, all the while the girl he was dating, feeling.\\"  Just like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" has Steele whispering \\"suck my d***\\" subliminally, this track has \\"smoke pot\\" among other unintelligible lines whispered throughout most of the second half.    4.5 stars.  Had this record included \\"Suspended in Dusk,\\" I would've given it a perfect five stars.  By far the most gothic album I've ever heard, with amazing mixing, superb creativity, and excellent art design.  Type O was supposed to always be this, in my opinion.  I hope they come back this direction.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I never really heard of A Perfect Circle before this album and was completely blind to Mer De Noms. A buddy of mine stopped by and asked me if I wanted to listen to the album, and me being open minded agreed to it. The first thing I noticed is that they can build up a song like no other. \\"The Package\\" is such a great opener for an album and is a great song overall. Gives off such a great vibe - not happy, but more along the lines of creepy to say the least. A year later, I am still listening to this album. <br /> <br />I heard \\"Weak And Powerless\\" on the radio without even knowing it and was really, really upset when the DJ didn't say who it was. What do you know, it's the second song on the album. Every instrument sticks out on it's own in this album. The bass lines are creative as hell and the guitar riffs are just beautifully pulled off. Maynard writes some very good lyrics and flawless vocal patterns. <br /> <br />The only reason why I didn't give this album five stars is because I can't stand the song \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\", but if they took that song out this would definitely be a five star album. Very friendly to the ear.
B000002AQQ|4.0|This is the quintessential classic rock movie soundtrack. It does a great job expressing the emotion of the movie as it progresses (such classic protest songs as Buffalo Springfield's \\"For What it's Worth\\" and CCR's \\"Fortunate Son\\" are prime examples of this), and, especially in the case of disc 2, does so using excellent songs from the time. As far as a soundtrack to the movie, this is quite possibly the best of any soundtrack ever made. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the album is missing quite a few songs that not only made the movie but are favorites of mine, and I have discovered that many people agree with me. Jimi Hendrix's rendition of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" is a powerful song, used in a very convincing manner in the film to portray the fear and loathe of the Vietnam War. The song was a quintessential track in the film, and an unbelieveably well-done song at that, and more than deserves to be on the soundtrack. Such classics as Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" and \\"Free Bird\\" that define the southern culture and are an anthems to southern rock are also greatly missed tracks, and, with \\"Free Bird\\" being the second most requested song on radio of all time it is quite surprising that they were left out. Personally, I was greatly dismayed that they (among others, including a slew of Doors songs) those tracks were left out. The album is still well-worth buying, but will be likely below the expectations of those who are fans of the music used in \\"Forrest Gump\\". The missing tracks are what separate this album from that which would be worthy of a \\"5\\".
6301973410|5.0|I own the movie on VHS and I can remember vividly the first time I saw it: It was during spring break in 1995. I visited my Dad here in Hammond (can it really be ten years?) when I rented it from Blockbuster Video. I watched it on a Saturday during the NCAA Basketball tournament and I can tell you that out of all of the movies that I've seen in my life \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is the most shocking movie I ever saw. The movie is filled with one stunning revelation after another, but none was no more bigger than the scene in which Mildred confronts her daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) and as Crawford's character tears up the paper into pieces (was it really money?) Veda slaps her mother so hard she falls down on the stairs (you may recall earlier in the movie Mildred slapped Veda by accident; now Veda was getting her revenge). That was the most shocking scene I ever saw in a film; no movie that I have seen, past or present, comes close to that lightning bolt between Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth. As that weren't enough the film has TWO different perspecives on how Pierce's second husband got killed! For those who haven't seen it, they have to. It is a twisted movie and did I mention that Joan Crawford deserve the Oscar for Best Actress? (Memo to Hilary Swank: You are jack compared to the former Lucille Lusur!)
B000062Y98|5.0|these guys have more creative spark than any other band on the market today. They are musical geniuses, literally, they are one of the most musically significant bands EVER. Bruce dickenson is a goddam joke, and his solo stuff coulnt wipe the shoes of BG's material, the Bruce song is nothing like the precoius lerusalem track. You have weak minded musical taste, your comments are both musically and historically incorrect, i suppose that ANY band that makes a song that inludes a word from another artists song, IS TOTALLY RIPPING THEM OFFF&lt; what a load of crap, you need 2 grow up man, and evolve with the times, judas priest are elderly men, who at thier best were good. but bands such as BG are the newer better versions of the old bands!! this album is immense, IMMENSE, listen to it again!!, idiot.

B000009EOR|5.0|This album is unique for 3 reasons.  1.  This is the Japanese version which contains bonus tracks from the German version.  2. This version contains other classic Kiss hits from their classic years including Rock and Roll All Night taken from ALIVE.  3. This album features Eric Carr on the cover.  This was Eric's first album wih the group and you get to hear his style that led him to being a truly awesome member of KISS

1400032717|4.0|It took me a while to finally get around to reading this enormously popular title--I wasn't so sure what the praise was all about--but this is a unique portrayal of a child (although Christopher is a teen) with this mysterious condition. I learned a few things--and  I think what makes this book so appealing is simply that there isn't much to compare it to..enjoy.
0440242576|4.0|As I was reading this hilarious novel by John Grisham, I was picturing the parts being acted out. The title of the the book basically tells you what it is about. A family plans to skip Christmas because their daughter will not be there, and it won't be the same since they always celebrate it together.  When the neighborhood finds out of the idea that a family is going to skip Christmas, the book explains all the different reactions to that crazy idea. The book also explains how the family deals with all the issues that are brought upon them. Since the movie and book are not exactly alike you should read this book especially if you have ever thought about skipping Christmas.
B0007O38F8|5.0|Yo I don't know how you could hate this. Songs like Piggy Bank, Outta Control, Gatman and Robin, So Amazing, and the rest are banging. If you a Fiddy fan this will make you keep you hungry for more.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I saw the show live in Dublin and subsequently bought the CD. I think the music and talent of the artists is fantastic. The energy at the live show was really something and I am very excited that it is coming to the US as I will definitely go to see it again.
044024157X|4.0|Just when you think that John Grisham is not so hot, he comes out with a good book that reminds you why he became successful in the first place.  The Last Juror is Grisham's best effort in many a year. <br /> <br />A back-of-the-book summary is rather misleading:  according to this description, the story is principally about a murderer who gets out of prison and starts killing the jurors who convicted him.  Actually, that is only a small part of the book, and these deaths don't even start till around the last quarter of the book.  What this novel really follows is Willie Traynor, who develops from an aimless part-time reporter to the owner of a small-town paper.   <br /> <br />Traynor - who is also the narrator - is typically more of an observer of events than a participant.  What he observes are the last secluded days of a small southern town before it becomes a part of the larger world.  When Traynor first comes to Clanton around 1970, it is still segregated and filled with typical small-town corruption; a family of moonshiners still are the local crime gang and Vietnam is a distant thought.  When one of the crime family rapes and kills a woman, there is some question if justice will be done.  Although a conviction does follow, the sentence winds up being relatively minimal.  Over the course of a decade, the town changes:  desegregation and Vietnam become controversial subjects and the small-town businesses yield to fast-food franchises and superstores.  And along with these changes, the killer is granted parole and people start dying. <br /> <br />There is a little of a twist at the end, but an experienced mystery reader will have things figured out long before the actual revelation.  That's okay, because in the end, this is not really a thriller or a mystery, but rather a mainstream novel.  And in avoiding his typical story materials, Grisham has written his best book in a long time. <br />
B00000DQSV|5.0|I have always liked Duran Duran, and Notorious is definitely a MUST HAVE for all the fans. With the departure of Andy & Roger Taylor, this album definite sounds different from their previous albums. Listen to A MATTER OF FEELING, it gives me a chill. With horns added into their songs - its a definite MUST HAVE!!! <br />

6305132984|5.0|The film West Side Story received ten Academy Awards in 1961 and could easily have won more. It is as powerful and as graceful today as it was when it first premired. A musical that combines drama, ballet, humor, poetry, irony, and some spectacularly tasteful camera effects, West Side Story boasts a score by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, on-site filming on Manhattan's lower West Side, and superb choreography with the expert directorship of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins. The film was probably Natalie Wood's best performance in the role of immigrant girl Maria, newly arrived in New York from Puerto Rico, totally unaware of the hostilities in her new surroundings. <br /> <br />It is at the dance at the gym where Maria, betrothed to Chino (Jose Vega), a young Puerto Rican, meets Tony (Richard Beymer) totally by accident during a dance that is, in truth, a challenge between the Sharks, a Puerto Rican gang headed by Maria's brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris), and the Jets, headed by Tony's best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), who had invited Tony to attend the dance. Immediately Anita (Rita Moreno), Bernardo's girlfriend, warns Maria to stay away from Tony because he is \\"one of them,\\" but Maria replies, \\"I only saw him,\\" indicating that she is blind to the prejudices around her. Neither Tony nor Maria care about the bigotry and ill will between the gangs, which only causes trouble between the Jets and the Sharks, who plan to fight for controlling their neighborhood. Both sides claim they will fight fairly to one another, but secretly they plan to use any means to keep control, even if it means using knives. <br /> <br />Tony feels he can reduce the fight to a fist fight and avoid any real violence. Maria, however, wants to avoid any fight and asks Tony to stop the fight. When Tony shows up at the rumble and tries to stop the fight, the Sharks jeer at him and try to incite him to attack. They succeed at angering Tony to the point that he hits Bernardo. Bernardo draws a knife, and soon both sides draw knives. It isn't long before Riff is killed, and in retaliation, Tony stabs Bernardo. Tony realizes what he has done and screams, \\"Maria!\\" The police are on the way, and Tony runs for dear life. <br /> <br />Maria is waiting for Tony to return, believing that he has stopped the fight, when Chino enters. She sees he is wounded and asks if he has been fighting. Chino is upset, and Maria asks if Tony was hurt. Chino answers angrily, \\"He killed your brother!\\" <br /> <br />Maria, crying furiously, enters her room, and prays, \\"Please, let it not be true!\\" She cannot stop crying, but she cannot believe what she has heard. Tony appears, and she turns to him, beats him with her fists, and screams, \\"Killer! Killer!\\" Yet she sobs and melts into his arms. Tony explains what happened, and Maria realizes that things got out of control. \\"It's not us! It's everything around us!\\" <br /> <br />Tony stays with Maria until he hears Anita arriving. Tony leaves her room through the window. Anita enters, looks around, and sees Tony in the distance. She angrily says, \\"Don't you see he's one of them?!?!?\\" In the duet that follows, \\"A Boy Like That,\\" Anita expresses her anger for Maria's betrayal, and Maria answers the paradox of love in \\"I Have a Love,\\" one of the most rare and beautiful moments of modern musical theater. In the final lines, both women sing, \\"When love comes so strong, there is no right or wrong, your love is your life.\\"  <br /> <br />Anita tells Maria that Chino has obtained a gun and is out looking for Tony to shoot him for what he did to Bernardo.  <br /> <br />Maria tells Anita, \\"If he does that, I will...\\"  <br />Anita says, \\"You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo?\\"  <br />Maria says, \\"I love Tony.\\"  <br />Anita replies, \\"I know. I loved Bernardo.\\" <br /> <br />The police arrive, and Maria wants to send a message to Doc's store, a favorite hangout of the Jets, where she is sure Tony might come to wait for her. She tells Anitain a cryptic manner to go there to tell Doc that she would go there herself to pick up a package but that she has been detained, meaning that she would come to meet Tony but cannot. Anita leaves so that Maria can talk with the police. <br /> <br />When Anita arrives at Doc's store, the Jets are there, but they receive her with hostility because she is Puerto Rican. Instead of allowing her to deliver the message, they assault and abuse her. Anita then responds in anger, \\"Tell Tony that Maria's never going to meet him. Chino found out about them and shot her. She's dead!\\" <br /> <br />Doc sadly gives this false message to Tony, who has been waiting in the basement of his store. Tony, shattered by the news, bursts outside of his store, shouting, \\"Chino, come and get me, too, Chino!\\" <br /> <br />It is later as he wanders outside that Maria appears. Tony is overjoyed to see her, but just as they meet, Chino appears and shoots Tony dead. Tony dies in her arms. The final scene is particularly heart wrenching and is one that the viewer must see to appreciate fully. <br /> <br />It amazed me that although I had seen this film several times before, repeat viewings did not diminish its impact. This is a film that is a must for any cinema buff's collection.
B0001AP12G|4.0|*** 1/2 stars  (intro)  Kanye West introduced himself to hip hop long before he started rapping, as he did production on a whole lot of tracks for underground MC's and tons of stuff for the Rocafella family but only now we get to hear him. This albums brings along peeps like Ludacris, Freeway, Twista, Talib Kweli, Jay-Z, Mos def, Common & Syleena Johnson to name some notables and even Bernie Mac cameos.  (Lyrically)  I didn't buy &#34;College Dropout&#34; because I thought he was a nice MC. I bought it because of high production quality, but was surprised to hear that, though not a tight lyricist like some of the people on his album, he is pretty clever with word phrasing and delivery. I can listen to him. His album is varied with subjects like religion/spirituality (Jesus Walks & Never Let Me Down), girls (Slow Jams & Workout Plan), black folks (We Don't Care & All Falls Down), personal/family (Through the Wire & Family Business) & having fun with rhyming (Two Words, Last Call & Get 'Em High). Kanye also raps with a light-hearted sense of humor and is pretty funny at times and doesn't take himself to seriously either, so just to here his little sly remarks and stabs is worth the listen-if not purchase. Common,Talib, Free, Jay & Mos all bring their A game, which helps Kanye out.&#34;Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis&#34;,&#34;Lock yaself in a room doin' 5 beats a day, for 3 summers, that's a different world, like Cree summers, I deserve to do these numbers, the kid that made that, deserves that Maybach&#34;, &#34;It's funny how wasn't nobody interested, until I almost killed myself in Lexis&#34; are some of Kanye's Lyrics.  (production)  Kanye puts his best (so far) effort into the production. He didn't use up all his work on his years with the Roc and he even mellowed out on the use of sped up voice samples-that became his signature. He found other ways to keep his talent fresh without changing styles altogether. It's still Kanye.  (outro)  Why not five stars? A few songs lack the beat quality as others cuts on the LP-especially since we know what he can do (&#34;Poppin' Tags&#34;, &#34;Girls,girls,girls&#34; etc.) and some of the skits could have been cut and replaced by songs instead, plus I heard songs that were decent that were cut from the album. Kanye is not Talib or Mos or Common, so don't expect the sharpest lyrics.Ye's beats are not as spectacular as other stuff he's done, but they are decent. &#34;Get 'Em High&#34; is decent lyrically but not beat wise.&#34;Spaceship&#34;, &#34;Last Call&#34;, &#34;School Spirit&#34; &#34;Two Words&#34; &#34;We Don't Care&#34; &#34;All Falls Down&#34; & &#34;Through The Wire&#34; are the tightest productions all around. A very good debut, especially from a &#34;College Drop-out&#34; -'Qil-
B00079FUI6|5.0|I am the perfect example that anyone can enjoy this show.  With a title like \\"Depereate Housewives\\" it seems to put alot of people off, becasue they don't believe that they can enjoy this wondeful show.  Well I am here to set the record striaght.  I am a 17-year-old High school Senior Male (who just entered the UCSC) and Despereate Housewives has quickly become one of my top three favorite shows on the air (the other two being \\"Gilmore Girls\\" and \\"Veronica Mars\\").    The show is about four, sometimes five housewives and how there lives become meshed as they try to figureout the mystery behind why one of there fellow neighbors committed suicides.  Beyond this mystery, each of the housewives have there own troubles at home to over come.  Marcia Cross plays housewife one who has and off-again, on-again relations with her husband because he thinks she is too perfect, Felicity Huffman plays housewife two - a woman who has to deal with a husband who is never home and a home full of little monsters (also known as six and five year old boys), Eva Longoria plays housewife number three, a woman who isn't quit sure if her husband is the person she wants to spend her life with, and finally housewife number four player to perfect by Teri Hatcher is a 40-year-old woman who is recently divorced and has to take care of her 14-year-old daugter, but due to her neurotisisesy's it seems the daughter takes care of her.    I have just scratched the surface of what this show is about.  During the first few episodes the show is trying to figure out what it wants to be (comedy or drama), yet it finally desided upon dramedy.  The series won both the golden globe for best comedic series, but also for Teri Hatcher for best Actress (two additional actresses where nominated as well).    But what makes this series so special is the fact that it was a last chance at a career for most of the people involved.  The creator was literally at the end of his ropes havn't to borrow money from his mother to write the script, and actresses Felicity Huffman and Teri Hatcher could no longer find work.  This show is just a testiment that the old hollywood mantra \\"the younger, the better' does not apply anymore.    With \\"Unaireable / Uncencored episodes,\\" Audio Commentary by the Cast and Crew, Bloopers, Behind-the-Scenes footage, and deleted scenes this is definately the DVD to own this september.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm not going to sit here and bash this set because Greedo didn't really shoot first, etc. That's a critique that should be left for the original Special Edition. I'm going to critique the video quality and the extras included in the set.  <br /> <br />First, the video transfers are OUTSTANDING. The film is crisp and very clean. If Lucas hadn't already released the Special Editions in 1997, I would be even more impressed since this would be the first time these films would have been available in WIDESCREEN in over 20 years. For pure viewing pleasure, the audio and video quality are PERFECT. <br /> <br />EXTRAS - Here's where the set really let me down. The extras included are nice, but just don't feel like enough to satisfy more than just casual Star Wars fan. The most glaring omissions are the infamous deleted scenes (Luke at the Toshi station, the sandstorm scene from RotJ). Anyone who has purchased the \\"Making the Magic\\" CD-ROM will have seen them, but it would have been nice to include them on the DVD set, too. Also, it would have been nice if there was an option to watch the original versions of the films, or at least the original versions of the Special Editions to see what changes were made for the DVD release. As it was, I had to hook up another TV in my living room and watch the VHS and DVD side by side to compare. I really didn't like the commentary on A New Hope. When I listen to commentary, I want to hear things like \\"What I was going for in this scene is...\\" or \\"When we were shooting THIS scene...\\" Through the entire commentary for ANH, though, Lucas mainly talks about \\"my vision\\" and just his general approach to the Star Wars universe. The commentary on ESB and RotJ is much better, with director Irvin Kershner of ESB doing the best job explaining his approach and the different techniques he had to use in shooting the film. Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Ben Burtt (sound designer), Dennis Muren (special effects supervisor). Burtt's and Muren's contributions are informative, but Fisher's are mostly useless. <br /> <br />\\"Empire of Dreams\\" is the biggie here, a 2.5 hour documetary that originally aired on A&E. It's a good documentary on the Star Wars phenomenon. The three smaller featurettes are okay but don't really provide new information for fans. What would have been nice would be some featurettes on HOW they made the blasters, HOW they constructed the full-size Millenium Falcon set, HOW they actually did stuff. These documents are very general in their approach. Trailers for the original films are included and, while it's interesting to see how far movie trailers have come in 25 years, the trailers on their own are B-A-D. Most just include stills or McQuarrie paintings, and some guy who I guess was \\"The Trailer Guy\\" before the current \\"Trailer Guy\\" got his job. Photos, movie posters and TV trailers are also included. It would have been nice to include the Special Edition trailers as well. There's also a preview for Episode III, but I haven't watched it yet for fear of spoiling the movie. And X-Box demo for Star Wars: Battlefront is also included, but I'm a PS2 owner, so it don't do me any good. <br /> <br />The films themselves are perfect in terms of video and audio quality. If DVDs could just be judged on the film alone, this set would be a 5 star set. The extras are good, just not GREAT. They just aren't enough, for me at least. What knocks this down to four stars for me is the LACK of things, namely the exclusion of the ORIGINAL films. Most fans I talk to want a DVD quality release of Star Wars 1.0. Call these films Star Wars 2.1.  For now, this set takes its place alongside my VHS collection of the original three films.
0812550706|2.0|There's no harm in enjoying a book, and apparently a lot of people enjoyed Ender's Game, and that's great, but the overwhelming hype, as far as it relates to the average adult reader, is not justified. Calling this book \\"The most awesome sci-fi book ever!\\" and \\"Masterpiece!\\" is not warranted by any standards. This is a decent Young Adult book, not a pinnacle of great fiction, let alone sci-fi.  And make no mistake: This IS a `Young Adult' book and I can't help but think that the reviewers so vehemently stating that this is adult fiction either haven't read a lot or are using the anonymity of this forum to conceal their real age. (Read the 5 stars reviews; first of all notice how many say \\"A Kid's Review\\"; that means they're under 13, then notice how many were assigned this as middle-school reading, then notice how few of them are written by someone who actually knows how to write a thoughtful book review. Yes, I'm condescending, but it's true...)    Here's the deal: If you're a kid in middle school, `gifted' or otherwise, you might like this book. It's got action, some ok character development, and some philosophical and existential themes that raise the story above straight action-style sci-fi. Card is an imaginative writer, and knows how to tell a decent story. If this book leads you to pick up books by writers like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, Dan Simmons, Arthur C. Clarke, Tolkien or Gene Wolfe then it's done its job.  On the other hand, if you are now a 20- or 30-something and this is still your favorite book you really need to move on to something more mature.
B00005RYL2|4.0|In a word, this movie was original. Various aspects of immortality have been explored for years, mostly as vampire legend stories. When this movie premiered we were gifted with beautiful scenery and cinematography. Christopher Lambert's acting is well above typical for action/adventure/fantasy movies. <br /> <br />The story was engaging, directing was also progressive, in that the movie shifts time periods and flashes back to earlier memories for the main character, something that was less common when this film was made than now. Dialogue is generally good, though MacLeod's first wife is a bit of a boor in a small part. Sean Connery delivers quite a fun and memorable performance in a quite lively character. I think he didn't want to return for endless sequels, but it appears that he had fun making the film. <br /> <br />The premise of the movie is simple: there are individuals who are immortal, can sense each other when nearby, and for some reason they must meet and fight to the death (only accomplished via beheading) until there is only one left alive. The movie tagline cashes in on this: \\"There can be only one!\\" Indeed we are not privy to the reason for this and it is never explained in this film. The swordplay is however, very well choreographed and is not gory. The effects are simple but pretty good for 1986. <br /> <br />Lambert was involved in the creative side and later production as well. Unfortunately the studios weren't very supportive. They had set out to make this movie and the sequel to complete the story at the same time. Budget issues and studio bosses reared their ugly heads and things were cut and the production in trouble in order to complete the second movie, which turned out to be a big disappointment when released. This film, however, didn't get attacked by the budget machine, except for the editing genius who decided the movie was too long and the audience wouldn't sit still, so the studio cut the movie more than Lambert would have preferred. This DVD restores the film to its original desired length and the transfer is very good. Even without liking this genre, you might well enjoy this story.
0140120416|5.0|This is a great book. Very well organized, with easy to learn explanations. I would recommend this book to anyone. I learned to read (but not yet translate!) Russian in 2 days with this book.  <br /> <br />I would, however, also recommend picking up a tape or cd Russian course to go with it to help understand the pronunciations.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Saw it on PBS ! Fresh and exciting ! I got the DVD + the CD. Love it. If enough people would know about it, I am sure it would be a chart topper. Finally something refreshingly new in this world of boring CD's.

B00000J7JO|5.0|This is simple the masterpiece of the Red hot chili peppers. Here they finally found balance between funk and melody (and John does his best guitar playing ever while Anthony does his best singing ever.) I'll review this great album track by track: <br />1 AROUND THE WORLD 10/10 A great hard song to start off the album in grand style, Flea, Chad and John are in topform (as on the whole album) and Anthony does dome great rapping in the verses and fantastisc melodic singing in the chorus <br />2 PARALLEL UNIVERSE 10/10 Great spacy rock song  <br />3 SCAR TISSUE 10/10 The greatest riff combined with the greatest singing <br />4 OTHERSIDE 10/10 An alltime rock classic <br />5 GET ON TOP 9/10 Would have been a 10 if it were on an other album, great hard song <br />6 CALIFORNICATION 10/10 A classic with great lyrics <br />7 EASILY 10/10 Even greater lyrics (!) and overall a very good song <br />8 PROCELAIN 10/10 Maybe the slowest song the RHCP have ever done but I just love it <br />9 EMIT REMMUS 9/10 Very good rock song <br />10 I LIKE DIRT 9/10 Great harder song with freaky lyrics  <br />11 THIS VELVERGLOVE 10/10 My favourite track of the album, just plain great (music, lyrics, singing, atmosphere) <br />12 SAVIOR 9/10 A roaring rock song <br />13 PURPLE STAIN 9/10 Nice song with anthony rapping and singing freaky lyrics <br />14 RIGHT ON TIME 10/10 A few minutes of pure punk rock with an catchy and melodic chorus (my second favourite track of the album) <br />15 ROAD TRIPPIN' 10/10 A great road song and a great way to end a great album!!!  <br />
0783219733|5.0|\\"Everything was just fine until Beethoven came into our lives.\\",quipps George Newton(Charles Grodin). Before the lovable St. Bernard entered the Newton household,it was completely flawless. Beethoven broke free from a truck enroute to a homeless shelter and happened to gain the attention of George,his wife Alice(Bonnie Hunt) and their children Ryce,Ted and Emily. The mutt got his name from some music played by kindergarten-age Emily,composed by the late classical music great Ludwig von Beethoven. In fact,Emily was playing \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\". At first,the Newtons were reading ballots trying to come up with names. Alice immediately recognized Emily's ballot,written in crayon. \\"Body parts would not make good names for the dog.\\",Alice tells Emily. Emily replies,\\"He has one of those. I looked.\\" Also,\\"That's what you call Uncle Richard.\\". Emily knew the slang term for the male sexual organ! Other memorable scenes include the Newton kids being babysat by an incapable woman(Alice fired her after only one job). Also Beethoven \\"giving a ride to\\" a pair of inept,deceitful people who are business associates of George's. Beethoven was physically abused by a homeless shelter worker posing as a veterinarian. Emily personally saw the guy hit the mutt. At first,the others thought Beethoven bit the guy. George was gonna have the mutt euthanized but the mutt is saved. The so-called villain and his partner were indicted on a multitude of counts of animal cruelty. The other animals in the shelter were rescued by the Newtons. The Newtons also appeared in the TV coverage of the crime. In the last scene,George,Alice and the kids are all together with the rescued animals including Beethoven. What a sweet,happy ending! Director Brian Levant's other film credits include 1991's PROBLEM CHILD 2 and 1994's THE FLINTSTONES. Those films,like this one were distributed by Universal Pictures.
B0006284JQ|1.0|I thought the gods were going to bless us when I heard that Spears was going to retire.  Well, remaking one oldie and then releasing her \\"Greatest Hits\\" isn't exactly staying in the spotlight (Thank God).  Always mediocre, Spears realized the limits of her, uh, gifts.....then paraded them on stage and at every sleazy award program.  Spears and her pal Madonna should retire their G-strings and stay out of sight.  Madonna, the middle-aged old broad and Spears...aging quickly to catch up......have single-handedly brought the music industry down many notches.
B00079HZUM|5.0|I found Stage Beauty to be a wonderfully moving story about our places in life, the roles we play, and how love brings us closer to who we really are.  Others have delved into the plot and basic storyline, so I'll skip that and go straight into what I thought of the film. <br /> <br />I found the story to be that of two kindred spirits bringing out the best in each other.  In both cases, both Maria and Ned bring something out of each other that they never knew existed.  He brings out her dormant acting talent, and she brings out a side of him he could never pursue or express when he was playing female roles.  I loved how this was a story of a fully grown man trying to figure out his own identity--this isn't some teenage coming-of-age story.  I don't believe Ned's problem was as simple as having to choose a role (act like a man or act like a woman), he had to go beyond gender roles and transcend them to realize who he was as a person, and Maria facillitated this process. <br /> <br />Billy Crudup is fantastic.  I can't believe he did not receive an oscar nod.  This film works because of him.  The role of Ned Kynaston is such a difficult one to play, but he made it his own.  Claire Danes, interestingly, plays the 'guy,' in a sense.  Like Kirsten Dunst in Wimbledon, it's the women who come and help the guys out, not the other way around like in traditional romances.  There is chemistry between the two actors, so it makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br />The climactic scene was absolutely fantastic.  I was on the edge of my seat.  The movie was deeply satisfying, and ranks as one of my favorite films I've seen within the last year, if not the favorite.  I actually prefer this to Shakespeare in Love, which was sort of a miss for me.  Stage Beauty, however, is a full-on hit.
0060931671|3.0|Reading this reminded me of an article published<br />by Messrs Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal that argued that \\"modern French philosophy is a load of old tosh.\\"<br />Then they went on publishing a book on a subject, called<br />\\"Impostures Intellectuelles\\"<br /><br />While Pynchon is not a French philosopher, this book could be<br />classified as a load of tosh. The plot is convoluted as<br />there is a much of nonsense thrown around without justification<br />or regard for its relevance within the story line.<br /><br />Among other things we learn that:<br /><br />1. There is a Perpetual Motion Machine built (and operational<br />apparently) in UC-Berkeley.<br />2. Huge right-wing anti-government conspiracy operates a stealth<br />postal system, known as WASTE.<br />3. Charcoal for cigarette filters is produced from human bones<br />4. LSD could be an impediment for effective communication<br />5. Etc.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good wholesome summer read, although one wonders<br />whether the author was under the influence of the said LSD while<br />coming up with some of his dense writing.
B000002UW1|5.0|It's hard for me to believe: I'm almost thirty now, and I wasn't even ten years old when this record came out. I remember hearing \\"It's the End of the World...\\" and \\"The One I Love\\" when I was in fourth and fifth grade, and being intrigued by the songs, but not knowing who the singers were. It wasn't until Green and \\"Stand\\" that I found out who R.E.M. was. And I've loved them ever since. <br /> <br />I listened to the whole album when I was nineteen, and I played it over and over again. This disc is a true masterpiece from beginning to end; all the songs form a cohesive whole, from \\"Finest Worksong\\" to \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" to \\"Lightin' Hopkins.\\" <br /> <br />These four men were some of the people who taught me how to listen to music. It was because of them that I went back and listened to the blues, to jazz, and to early rock and roll. No history of rock and roll or of American music would be complete without R.E.M.
B00005JM1F|1.0|My situation is similar some to the others who were told it was funny and I wanted to see this movie. There was nothing funny about it; I could not watch the whole movie. Nothing original, I felt they were taking from Animal House and SNL.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok, so 861 people have reviewed the CD, but few if any have taken the time to tell the story of Jesus of Suburbia (JoS), St. Jimmy (St.J), and Watsername (W). So here it is... <br />   Once upon a time there was a guy called JoS. He is pretty pissed off at the world in general. He feels that there is an entire nation conforming to the edicts of a certain group of people (politicians and/or the media). He wonders if anyone cares about or is even listening to what he thinks, and realizing that he is nothing but a product of \\"his father's rage and his mother's love\\", he runs away from home. At first it is like one big holiday, where he feels what it is like to truly rebel and be free. During this time, he dabbles in drug use and the like. But soon, he is despondent, thinking that he has no future and no one to care for him. His anguish escalates as he feels isolated from the world. But then, he meets someone- an exciting person with a less-than-respectable past- St. Jimmy. St.J shows him how much fun his world can be, where even someone who is the \\"son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe\\" can live carefree. Soon though JoS's pain returns as he realizes that true rebellion is not doing drugs and being self-destructive; it is really just standing up for what you believe in. The pain he experiences is at the level where all he wants is someone to love him and make him feel better again. Enter Watsername. She is a true rebel, who lives by roaming the country and being unique. She finds an ally in JoS who she is remarkably similar to. They begin a journey together that mark a new and positive period of both their lives. However things quickly deteriorate as their relationship becomes more volatile. She spends many nights crying and he just wants to die. W is a girl who is unappreciated and who is truly extraordinary beyond measure (not to mention a good influence). But W is fed up and she breaks up with JoS in an angry letter that says what she truly feels. JoS is devastated andspends a while being beyond hope and just wants to be happy again. But happiness is hardwon- St.J commits suicide in a fit of depression, astounding JoS. But he pulls himself together and manages to repair his life somewhat. Eventually he returns home to his parents, older, wiser, and jaded. At the end of this dramatic story we have JoS wondering where W is now and how she is doing. Knowing he will never forget their time together. <br />                ~The End
B00025ETIW|4.0|I saw this band on Discover and Download like 4 or 5 months ago and even though (at first) I didn't like their song \\"I'm not okay\\", I loved the energy they gave while performing, which to me is almost as important as the music itself when I watch a performance.  Oddly enough I bought the cd (something I never do before downloading a few tracks first).  When I popped it in I could only listen to \\"I'm not Okay\\" and then I turned it off.  Didn't listen to it for a few weeks then decided to give it another go round, and I REALLY like this band a lot now.  I don't know what to name their sound, but it's original for the most part.  My favorite tracks are Helena, and the Ghost of You.  The intro to Thanks for the Venom is sick as hell, but the rest of the song is just mediocre.  I hate the fact that MTV and every other magazine keeps labeling this band to become the next big thing, that sets peoples expectations too high and that's never a good thing as you can tell with 50 Cent's new cd (trash).  Anyways, pretty good band and for anyone who's into Screamo/punk, with a touch of pop and crunching riffs, you'll love this cd.  Great lyrics too by the way.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I've always been a fan of Judas Priest but haven't listened to them as much in recent years. I was looking through the new releases at Target and bought this cd. On the ride home I got goosebumps..It is unbelievable! I am impressed, I highly recommend this cd!
B0002OERI0|1.0|i would just like to say i am not expecting a band to remain with the same sound their entire career but anyone who says this is a more mature, big step forward or that they are growing as artists, is kidding themselves. If you truely believe that this is growth from what they did before then you are saying all this radio pop sound alike shiney media hyped music is the hieght of musical standard give me a f**ckin break. What is going on in music? greenday sounding like simple plan? motley crue's new single was written by simple plan.... i suppose you would believe a no talent punk boy band like simple plan is the expectation of musical limits and standards? this is very very sad.
B0000028M7|5.0|I am a big AIC fan I got into them around the time when Layne died [RIP]<BR>I bought this album after hearing them bones on ATV off road fury. This is one of the greatest and underated albums ever. It deals with sad and anger emotions. It starts with them bones a fast paced rollercoaster ride.This album shows AIC gifted ability to write great sad songs witch is something alot of bands today couldn't write if there life depended on it.<BR>I could name others but f**k it. Botom line this is a great album. The lyrics are untouchable espeacially on would and down in a hole.
B000002J0B|5.0|\\"Houses of the Holy\\" is probably Led Zeppelin's creative peak; it's even more diverse than its predecessor, and features some rare lighthearted moments for the band.    \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is a rapid, guitar-driven anthem; very complex, and has an epic feel. It's terrific. As is \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", part accoustic/part electric. It has a nice build-up, and is very catchy.    \\"Dancing Days\\" is a catchy rocker with a psychedelic flare to it; and the album closes with \\"The Ocean\\", another terrific rock song with a very infectious riff.    There's a lot of different sounds on here, too. \\"D'Yer Mak'er\\" is a Caribbean/reggae flavored pop song. Fun at first, but grows increasingly grating. \\"The Crunge\\" is a James Brown-styled funk song - really. It's fun, and that time signature is mad.    Other highlights include the Mellotron/string soaked ballad \\"The Rain Song\\". It's lush, mysterious, and gorgeous. And the dark, prog-rock epic \\"No Quarter\\" is downright creepy. It even has a jazzy piano break in the middle.    This is Led Zeppelin's most colorful album, and it's very consistent throughout. Another essential addition.
B00068NVI4|1.0|I like YES so much.  I have many YES dvd's like..  Symphonic Live, Q.P.R Vol1,2, House of YES  Yes speaks, Yes years, Yes Acoustic  Keys to Ascension...    And I have been waiting this dvd since 2004.  But, still no release date announced...  For more, they changed release date 2~3 times.    In my opinion, release date is a kind of promise to YES fans.  So, I give 1 star for this dvd.  For sure, I will buy this dvd and give stars again.    Please..Release..
B000002KFJ|4.0|While Black Sabbath was expanding their sound with each successive album, it was on Sabotage where their eclecticism reached its fruition. Ozzy Osbourne is the star here as his emotional vocals match the mood of each song very well. The opening \\"Hole in the Sky\\" starts the album out strong and is highlighted by Ozzy's screaming vocals and a very simple but nasty riff from Iommi. \\"Thrill of It All\\" is led by a funky (!) riff before it goes into its melodic chorus. The keyboards on this track as well as the rest of the album work much better than the attempts on their previous album, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. \\"The Writ\\" continues the band's reputation of more great riffs in one song than most bands do on one album. The pleasant surprise is during its soft choruses where the acoustic guitars and keyboards make the track sound like a lullaby. \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" is the best known track here and for the first 4:25, it's Sabbath at their best. Ozzy's vocals are top notch, Bill Ward's drumming is very intense and the riffs just keep on coming. However, when the song becomes a jazzier affair, it loses some momentum. The live version on Ozzy's Speak of the Devil cuts out the jazzy outro and is stronger than the original. \\"Megalomania\\" is the album's standout and plays like a soundtrack to a horror flick at its beginning before building in momentum into its theme. Although it clocks near 10 minutes, it never feels like it and this is one of their best songs ever. However, \\"Supertzar\\", while unique in its interplay between the choir and Iommi would have made a better 1:30 intro rather than a near 4-minute song. \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" is the biggest attempt at garnering a hit. While many diehard fans hate this track, lyrically it fits in with the album's themes of despair and paranoia. Having it placed between \\"Supertzar\\" and \\"The Writ\\" throws the album off base as well. If it were placed after \\"Hole in the Sky\\", the album would be a more cohesive listen. All told, this is considered the last of the great Ozzy-era Sabbath albums although the underrated Never Say Die! is worth hearing as well.s is considered the last of the great Ozzy-era Sabbath albums although the underrated Never Say Die! is worth hearing as well.
B000068QY7|3.0|There are few things that hurt as much as 2000's \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" in my opinion. In the mid to late ninties Oasis put out great record after great record, from \\"Definteley Maybe\\" to \\"Morning Glory\\" to \\"Be Here Now\\". Hell, even there B-Side comp, \\"The Masterplan\\" was brilliant, loud rock 'n' roll played the way it should've been. <br />But \\"Giants\\" stopped that. With its quasi-psychedlic electronica feel and half hearted at best songwritting, it was easy to see the points of Oasis detractors. But I never fully wrote them off and got \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" the day it came out and put it in my C.D. player as I soon as I got home from the C.D. store. And though it's not a triumphant return to form by any measure, it is defintley a step back to get back where Oasis belong. <br />It's been a little under three years from the release of \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" and my opinion of it has yet to change. There are some great songs here, there are some pretty good songs here, then there are the ones that just aren't worth a whole a lot. <br />The record gets started off on the right foot and then some with \\"Hindu Times\\" which is one of the bands best anthems. The new band(Gem and Andy Bell replacing Bonehead and Guigsy respectivly) add extra heft to Noel Gallagher's arena ready guitar lead while lead singer Liam Gallagher let's it all out, so to speak, with one of his most inspired vocal turns thus far. \\"The Hindu Times\\" is a mission statement wrapped up in a song, and its the records best track. <br />On the end of the spectrum, the Liam written \\"Betterman\\" finds one of Oasis only convincing modest moments when Liam sings \\"I want to be a betterman\\", a stark contrast to Oasis songs of yore, and the band backs him up to prove that yes, Oasis are still a helluva rock band. It's the best end of an Oasis record since \\"Champagne Supernova\\". <br />The stuff in between however rarely live up to the hype of these two songs sadly. There are other good songs that make up therecord, like the best-Oasis-ballad-since-\\"Wonderwall\\" \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\", the Noel sung \\"Little by Little\\", which has a chorus so big that its tough not to get on board with, and the other two Liam penned numbers, the psychedlic \\"Born on a Different Cloud\\" and the absolutley great \\"Songbird\\", a small and quick pop song that proves that Liam may very well be the best songwritter in Oasis now. <br />But with the exception of those songs, you get something that didn't come into play with the earlier Oasis record: filler. The other two Noel sung songs, the sappy \\"She Is Love\\" and bland \\"Force of Nature\\", are mediocre Oasis on autopilot, while the Gem penned \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\" has the right vibe but lacks the melody. The Andy Bell offering \\"A Quick Peep\\", a CCR esque instrumental, is too short to leave any sort of lasting impression, while \\"(Probably) All in my Mind\\" is a sad attempt at trying to recreate their heyday. <br />Another huge problem with the record is something that hurt \\"Standing On the Shoulder of Giants\\", and that is that there is way to little Liam. With Noel singing lead on three tracks and one being an instrumental, that leaves Liam seven songs out of eleven, which wouldn't be bad if he weren't one of rocks last great frontmen/ singers. Liam's voice can go from haunting to cocky in an instance and provides even the weaker numbers a little attitude that the songs he doesn't appear on lack. It's not that Noel has a poor singing voice; he sings just fine. He just lacks the bravado and feel of Liam, and the band was much better when he only sang one or two numbers per record. <br />Overall \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is a step back in the right step, but it's not a comeback. The record is worth owning even if it is better with the use of a good skip button.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|I'm not surprised this movie didn't do better.<br /><br />Despite a spirited cast and sure-footed direction, this film is a less than a memorable experience.  This is not because of any failing, in my estimation; rather, it is the result of their having done something well:  the filmmakers have portrayed their chief character precisely and unerringly.<br /><br />In other words, Paltrow is so successful in her role as Austen's officious egoist who fancies herself a master of high society (but who still has a lot of growing up to do) that the movie is actually a displeasure to watch!<br /><br />True, some of this is made up for later in the movie, but by then Emma has been such an irksome, meddling wench for so long that the character arc completed at the end of the film is unable to get us fully back to rights and leaves behind a sour taste.<br /><br />In many ways, movies are not like books.  Things can work in a book which will never work onscreen, and vice versa.  Everybody knows this.<br /><br />But this movie is a textbook example of what happens when you forget this.  In a book, for example, it's okay if the reader doesn't like the main character (e.g., Captain Ahab, Achilles, Pip) as long as he respects and sympathizes with him.  I don't know why, but in a movie this cannot be so.<br /><br />The main character in a film must be someone you like, or regardless of what else is excellent about the film, the director won't get away with it.  One hole after another will open up, and pretty soon it'll seem like everything's going wrong.  As that's exactly what happens here:  despite superb costume design and art direction, this is a movie that will certainly fail to grab you.<br /><br />So, in sum, I would say the problem here boils down to the material being unsuitable for the screen.  Those who are really into Austen often cite Emma as her most perfect work, both in terms of structural mastery and character development.<br /><br />But if you go by this adaptation alone, though, it will be very hard for you to see why.  Don't rip yourself off.ip yourself off.

The audio version is excellent as well, the reader made the scenes alive. My 7 year old son keeps imitating the british accent of the reader, it is hilarious.

6304288433|5.0|This is an excellent sequel.  The TV Version of this movie is alot better than the one on tape.  There are several deleted/extnded/and alternate scenes inclding an alternate ending.  Trust me, it is because I have it.  There are several.  I also have the TV version of the original.    The plot continues right where the first film left off.  Michael Myers escapes and Laurie is taken to the hospital and Michael follows her.  Dr. Loomis along with Sheriff Brackett and one of his Officers are tracking Michael.  Michael does some surgery on the staff of the hospital.  Michael catches up to Laurie and tries to kill her.  Dr. Loomis comes to her rescue and in an explosive finale Loomis tells Laurie to leave the room as Loomis blows it up!!!!  If you've seen it on tape you know how it ends.  We see Michael Burning.   If you have'nt seen the  TV version I'm not gonna spoil it by telling you the alternate ending.  Sorry!!!!!!  I like \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Halloween 2\\" excatly the same.  They're both awesome.  They both have an excellent plot.  I think they're alot better than \\"Halloween 4\\", and \\"Halloween 5\\".  Don't get me wrong I like 4 & 5 also, but I think 1 & 2 are a hell of alot better.  If you liked the original you'll love the sequel.  (I did, I loved them both the same  as I already metioned).
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall's latest album is of a slower tempo than her earlier work. This is more like 'lounge' music, gentle, soothing, smooth.<br /><br />Her rendition of such classics as 'S'Wonderful', 'Cry me a River', and 'Love letters' are the best I've heard. She's also included some Bossa Nova, not a type of music I'm normally keen on but after hearing Diana sing it I could change my mind.<br /><br />This is late evening music, sublime listening for when the lights are low and you just want to relax.

B00009ATIX|4.0|If you are looking for the gung-ho, high action, special effect filled type of science fiction film then forget this. If you like your sci-fi to be more thought provoking then this is for you.<br /><br />Starring George Clooney the movie is about a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Things start to change, the crew are going mad and no-one can figure out the problem. It is decided to send a psychiatrist (Clooney) to the stricken station to try and resolve the problem. However Clooney, when he gets to Solaris, is visited by his dead wife. Is he starting to lose his mind or is his wife real? That is the mystery of Solaris.<br /><br />A slow, but thoughtful film that is well worth watching and certainly not deserving the savage criticism given by some.
0060763280|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews, a quote from the book - \\"rich people constatnly learn and grow, poor people already know\\" - seems to fit perfectly. I would bet that most of the critics don't have two nickles to rub togehter. How could they? They are too busy wirting so called book reviews to have time to actually make a contribution to the world. If you already know everything there is to know about everything there is, then of course you don't need this book. If, however, you're the kind of person who likes to constantly learn and grow, you'll find more than your money's worth in this book. Is it profoundly original? Not the premise. But I think the way the ideas are presented is fresh. It's like the book says; If you're doing it (living the life of your dreams and being the person you were born to be) then you know it. Otherwise you've just \\"heard\\" about it. I'll bet the critics who claim to already \\"know\\" all this stuff don't really \\"know\\" it at all, they've just \\"heard\\" about it before.
B00000G3PA|4.0|The story is improbable to say the least; an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit the earth. Two space shuttles just happen to be ready to intercept and destroy it in a mere 18 days. The people who are chosen to blow up said asteroid are a motley crew of drillers. BUT...this is great fun. It's gung ho, fast paced, high action FUN. Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) leads his crew of oil drillers on a mission to save the world. A less likely bunch of astronauts has yet to be seen...the gang includes Rockhound, a womaniser who likes his girls young (Steve Buscemi), Oscar, a brilliant but spaced out geologist (Owen Wilson), A.J. Frost, an irresponsible daredevil (Ben Affleck) alongside an alcoholic, a gambler and so on.<br />Liv Tyler plays Grace, the daughter or Harry who is driven to distraction by his immaturity and Billy Bob Thornton is Dan Truman, the mission leader at NASA who defends the decision to bring in the drillers as opposed to using Americas 'finest young astronauts'.<br />This film is pure entertainment and doesn't pretend to be anything other than that. What you see is what you get, a high octane, action filled, special effects packed, fun film. Don't look for any deep meanings, just enjoy.

B000063JZQ|5.0|This is an outstanding production starring Jon Finch as the murderous Macbeth, a young Francesca Annis as his coldly ambitious wife, and Martin Shaw as Banquo, Macbeth's loyal friend. When this movie was released there was a fair amount of controversy due to what was seen as excessive violence and nudity. However the violence and nudity is not gratuitous and does add to the mood of this darkest of plays. The cinematography is atmospheric and portrays a brooding menace that perfectly fits the story about a man determined to be King and who will not stop at murder to gain the crown.<br />Although the play is not filmed in its entirety, some scenes are missing, only the purists will complain. There is still enough of the play for anyone who likes Shakespeare and it is a great introduction to 'The Scottish Play' for anyone who hasn't read it. Roman Polanski's Macbeth is bloody and violent, but then so is the Bards play.

B00005JNDZ|5.0|Bridget Jones is back, and at last can attend her mothers annual turkey curry buffet with a man in tow. This film begins six weeks after the end of the last movie. Bridget is madly in lust/love with Mark Darcy, and at last life seems to be giving her a break. In true Bridget style however, the path of true love cannot run smoothly and the cringe worthy but hilarious mishaps come thick and fast.<br /><br />Also back on the scene is the unreliable, conceited Daniel Cleaver. Will he manage to come between Bridget and Mark again? Watch and see. This is a terrific film...funny, heart-warming, and isn't it great to see a 'normal' sized woman get the hunk!

0385510454|4.0|Joel Backman, The Borker, likes to travel, nice from heart, quick learner, sharper than the spy is the hero of this novel. I enjoyed the travel narratives of Italy and other places. The outgoing president gave away pardon at the last hours to Joel and his journey starts.<br />In this case even though the quality is not excellent, as it was in The Firm or A Time to Kill, Grisham delivers a powerful novel that will satisfy those that are looking for something more than nonstop action. The only reason why this novel is not excellent in my opinion is that I felt the ending was a little rushed.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|For whose do not think this is a good album should wait until you see the concert , i think this is amazing work, you should go see the concert and you will like the album more, the entire 68 min will be so fast without you even know when it end. When i just bought the album i didn't like it that much .I thought it 's just sound like another Pat ' album but after i saw the concert i listen back and i like it more.Trust me ,it worth a try.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|There is no question that this is an essential album for any fans of guitar, especially those with a diverse taste in music. This is just full on ingenius soloing, shredding, slide playing, and anything else you want to see done with a guitar. <br />As usual, we have some trademark performances from old stalwarts. Clapton delivers a impassioned jam on Have You Ever Loved a Woman and plays great alongside Carlos Santana. McLaughlin, of course, is possibly the greatest jazz guitarist ever, and proves it again with Tones for Elvin Jones. And ZZ Top are as usual just good fun and a fitting way to close up a Texas show.  <br />Of course one of the best moments must be attributed to the absolutely unbelievable Robert Randolph. The vets are great and all, this guy is hungry and ready to prove himself which he does in spades. Check out Live at the Wetlands for some playing that will get you dancing and grooving late into the night. <br />Another new performer, whom I had never heard until this DVD, is Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. As a recently converted fan of Indian music, this blew me away. It is different and played early in the afternoon (the night crowds were out for Clapton) and he wakes everybody up with his custom made guitar, made specifically for the tones and rhythm of Indian classical. If you've ever enjoyed Ravi Shankar playing you need to hear this guy play. <br />Having said that, this could be much better. It is most egregious that you could NOT HAVE Jeff Beck on a guitar dvd, yet he played at the festival. Also some of the song choices were peculiar. How do Dan Tyminski, Vince Gill, and J.J Cale (mostly uninteresting performances) show up twice apiece while Buddy Guy, B.B King, and Hubert Sumlin (blues legends all) get one song each. Hell, they let Joe Walsh show up twice, and he was drunk (just look at him and you know). Furthermore, the superstar performances opening the dvd (containing Clapton, Guy, King, Cray, Sumlin and Jimmie Vaughan) are surprisinlyg devoid of life. There is no pulse to these jam sessions, and they all seem either bored or just out of time with each other. The least we could have were more solo performances for King and Guy (two of the most electrifying live blues players ever). In the case of Robert Lockwood Jr. (Robert Johnson's adopted son) and \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards are given such short thrift, that they play interviews DURING THEIR PERFORMANCES! Yes history of blues is great, Vaughan, but could you let me listen for a minute!  <br />I can't give this three stars for the compelling and intricate playing of Randalph, McLaughlin, Doyle Bramall, ZZ Top, James Taylor, and Cray. But if only for lack of more performances like these I can't give it 5 stars.
B0007GADZO|5.0|What a true masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!! Steve has truly outdone himself! \\"Building The Church\\" is definitely a statement! What a way to begin the CD! His vocals are really good as well, and I am glad that he opted to do them himself as opposed to having other artists sing on the tracks.<br /><br />The stand-out piece for me from the CD has got to be \\"Lotus Feet\\". What phrasing in his guitar work. This is a great song to just sit back, relax, and reflect upon your past life to. It can truly evoke wonderful, heart-felt memories.<br /><br />What I would truly love to hear next is a collaboration between Steve and Joe Satriani. That would be an out of this world CD!<br /><br />If you are a Vai fan, get this one. He does not disappoint!!!

034544678X|4.0|For anyone who loves their dog(s), this is a great read.  The purpose of the book is not training (although there are tips that can be gleaned), but it contributes to a greater understanding of why dogs aren't more like humans... duh!!!!  And I think it does a good job in that regard.  But of course, the reader has to care. <br /> <br />While it may seem obvious, the discussion of the difference between human/primate type behavior and canine behavior is very illuminating.  Primates interact in very different ways from canines, and just because a dog lives in your house, doesn't mean he/she understands predominantly primate type actions (hugs, frontal approaches, etc).  The photos of dogs being hugged, not a typical canine interaction, were particularly effective.    <br /> <br />If you are interested in understanding your dog and why he/she behaves or responds in particular ways to various situations, this is a good place to start.

B00005MCX0|4.0|The second album from legendary star-traveling metalloids Hawkwind is a big step up from their charming if flawed debut album...and almost where they'd plant themselves with their magnificent third album. They're getting there, though, and for the most part it's an engaging listening in. Especially since the beginning of the best-known Hawkwind lineup is now in place: aside from the early mainstays (guitarist Dave Brock, saxophonist/flutist Nik Turner, drummer Terry Ollis, keyboardsman/electronicat Del Dettmar), second guitarist Huw Lloyd Langton is gone, bassist Dave Anderson is succeeded by Ian (Lemmy) Kilmister before the album is done (Anderson co-wrote two songs), poet/vocalist Robert Calvert is aboard, and Dik Mik Davies (who seems to have exited briefly after the debut album) returns to team with Del Dettmar (who joined when Davies first departed) on keyboards and electronica.    The good news: It has their first bona-fide band classic, the extraterrestrial thrust of \\"Master of the Universe\\" (which beats the bloody hell out of Black Sabbath and their \\"Masters of Reality\\" any day of the week, and has probably been beaten to death for its popularity in concert over the years) and a pair of exquisite electro jams, \\"You Know You're Only Dreaming\\" (written by Brock) and \\"Adjust Me\\" (a group composition). Not to mention a pair of sweet acoustic dreams, \\"We Took The Wrong Step Years Ago\\" and \\"Children of the Sun.\\"     The not-so-good news: \\"You Shouldn't Do That\\" is fifteen minutes of grandly pounding rock and roll with perfectly understated electronic lacing and transdimensionally spare flute and guitar lines, as if the Velvet Underground had scored a 1950s sci-fi B-movie, but disrupted rather unconscionably by a lyric which doesn't exactly sound like it really belongs to this music.    The bonus news: Two brilliant earlier singles--the underrated \\"Born to Go\\" and the coming major hit \\"Silver Machine\\"--are included with this remastered version. So as a package of stepping forward and then kicking themselves right into their own future, the new \\"In Search of Space\\" probably outpoints the original album.     The best news: \\"In Search of Space\\" is a direct line to the beginning of their best studio work and, probably, their best-remembered period.
B000002UAU|5.0|I picked up this CD yesterday and decided to judge it based soley on how entertaining it is.  Pretending it spawned from the sky yesterday, I have to say the CD is as good as everyone says it is.  Virtually every single track is highly entertaining, with some being addictively good.  The only one I don't care for is \\"Within You Without You\\", and being 5-min long it is a shame I don't like it.  But with only one track not being exceptional, I have to give it 5-stars and must say unless I change my mind it seems to be solidly in my top 5 albums. <br /> <br />No one should rate this product 1-star, everyone likes atleast a couple songs.
B00005MCWZ|3.0|(Techincally, three and a half stars, but they don't allow you to offer halvesies here. No matter.) <br /> <br />If you can imagine the early Pink Floyd (\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" \\"More\\") as what would eventually become \\"speed metal\\" in extraterrestrial wrapping and a peculiar theme of Michael Moorcock (a future contributor, as it happened) meets the Marvel Super Heroes on more than a few controlled substances, that was Hawkwind.  <br /> <br />At least, that was Hawkwind as they'd become known beginning an album or two later. This debut set, long enough overdue for a remastering, displays much of what would soon identify the band, particularly its shifting between ethereal acoustic music and transdimensional electronic hard rock, but here it retains the very loose and very random feeling you might expect they'd have shown in their previous days as park buskers known for such performances as setting up and playing free outside the Isle of Wight festival and like appearances. Their future lyric hybrid is yet to be developed fully; here is a band which has found its sound but is trying to decide exactly what it is they really have to say.  <br /> <br />Still, it's a charming sounding album with much good music, particularly their three earliest near-signature numbers, the cheerful post-hippie acoustic tapper \\"Hurry On Sundown,\\" the stark surreal sonic wash of \\"Paranoia,\\" and the spry jam, \\"Be Yourself,\\" highlighted by reedman Nik Turner's half-Ayler, half-King Curtis saxophone squonk and guitarist Dave Brock's piercingly melodious break, both over a taut rhythm section and keyboardsman Dik Mik Davies's tastefully understated electronica. (True: erstwhile Pretty Things founder Dick Taylor not only helped produce the set but played some support guitar and bass on it.) This Hawkwind lineup--Brock, Turner, Davies, bassist John Harrison and then Thomas Crimble, second guitarist Huw Lloyd Langton, drummer Terry Ollis--wasn't destined to last: exit Crimble, Langton, and Davies after the album's release; enter ex-Amon Duul bassist Dave Anderson, keyboardsman Del Dettmar, and poet/vocalist Robert Calvert. Ahead lay \\"In Search of Space.\\" And, Hawkwind's truer future.
B000002UAO|5.0|I was just turning 13 when I Want To Hold Your Hand was released in the US... and the incredible phenomena that followed through the first 8 months in 1964 was probably the most exciting time in all of pop music history.  But after A Hard Day's Night excitement there was a lull in Beatles' releases for a few weeks and maybe some thought that they would settle back and become just another mid-60's pop group.  But that idea was blown apart when at the end of 1964 they released what I thought at the time was a perfect single ... I Feel Fine b/w She's A Woman.  And this constant ability to continually generate and invigorate evolving pop and then rock music was what distinguished the Beatles.  They continued to do this right up until their demise. <br /> <br />At the end of 1965 when Rubber Soul was released I knew, even at 14, that this was an album unlike any before... and I have to say I enjoyed the original American release over this version. <br />The album contained 3 outstanding McCartney numbers (and I do not include Michelle, which I thought was 'too pop' oriented).  They were \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and (on the US album, but not on the current CD.. and I can not understand why) \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\". The singing was crisp, witty, and worked so well with the musical arrangement that they still, today 40 years after the release, sound fresh. <br />John Lennon's lead is heard on another 3 masterpieces, the great \\"In My Life\\" - still one of the greatest Rock Love songs ever composed, the brillant \\"Norwegian Wood\\" - classic story telling with brillant musicianship which is also reflected in the standout \\"Girl\\". These rounded out 6 true masterpieces.  The runners up to these 6 were certainly none too shabby. George's \\"Think For Yourself\\" coupled with the Beatle harmony rises above the ordinary and John's \\"Run For Your Life\\"  is a great rocker.  The CD includes Nowhere Man / What Goes On, a US single that was not part of the original release.Drive My Car, on the US Revover release is included as well. I think they should have retained \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" and \\"It's Only Love\\" .. I think they both fit the mood and feel of the album. <br />I guess what else impressed about this album was it did not rely on building on the rock and roll that launched the Beatles ... it was tamer  -- more in mood with the folk influence, but still innovative in its own style, Beatle style.  It is also interesting to note that at its release in the US, the Beatles also released a classic single that was not part of the Rubber Soul collection ... Daytripper / We Can Work Out --It's interesting to recall this, because as subdued as the rocking was in Rubber Soul,  Day Tripper on the other hand reminded us that the Beatles were the best rockers around.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This is the best action movie i have ever seen, sure there are some visible flaw but who cares. the story, the action and everything else makes up for it. <br />BEST ACTION MOVIE EVER   :)
068987474X|1.0|One note book that becomes very tedious quickly- I can't believe this was STRETCHED out to an excruciating 165 pages. The 'He's Just Not That Into You' episode on Sex and the City was funny but this just goes on and on and on. The gist of the book is sound but we get it after 3-4 pages. I kept expecting something more as I went along but it was just more repetition. It doesn't help that Greg Behrendt comes across as the 'perfect' guy (but taken of course).
B00079HZUM|3.0|Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think every man who put on a dress, and acted on stage in the 17th century was a homosexual.  This is the impression that the movie left me with. <br /> <br />To tell that story is fine, but it bothers me to see it somewhat graphically depicted on screen.  It also bothers me to think that every man who put on a dress in the 17th century as a way out of the gutter, as Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) is a homosexual.  I believe the exact line is: \\"my tutor found me in the gutter, and taught me, and now I make my living at it.\\" <br /> <br />In my opinion this is what the movie is about.  An actor making a living playing women on stage (Billy Crudup).  We have a woman who wants to act but cannot because she is prohibited by law (Claire Danes).  King Charles (Rupert Everett) changes the law because of his mistress (Zoe Tapper) and (Claire Danes).  Leaving (Billy Crudup) angry and without a job.  <br /> <br />Now, who says the male actor in this story has to also have the additional difficulty of being homosexual.  It's only Hollywood trying to be politically correct and appeal to another segment of society to try to get their dollars. <br /> <br />You should see this movie if you like period pieces, or you are interested in the 17th century or you want to see some fine acting.  The DVD says that the movie is based on the diaries of Samual Pepys played by Hugh Bonneville.
B0006IEVFG|5.0|My previous watch was a sturdy, made in India, Titan quartz watch.  <br />I replaced it simply because I got bored of it. <br /> <br />I have loved Casio watches because they simply never stop working. <br /> <br />The DBE30-1AV is a very good watch for the price. This is the kind of watch for the people <br />who are obsessed with ultra-efficiency. The watch switches itself off to save power <br />when kept motionless in dark. When you pick it up and wear it, it switches on automatically <br />without having to press any buttons. <br /> <br />It is Solar, so you will never have to replace batteries. It has a backup battery which  <br />runs for 6 months. The backup battery will be used only when you dont see the sunlight for <br />a few days. <br /> <br />This watch has all the features (stop watch, databank, night light, international time and so on) <br /> that you might normally need. You will not need any more features unless you plan to climb the  <br />Everest (Some watches have a thermometer, pressure guage, altimeter and even a  <br />tv remote control...really!) <br /> <br />This watch looks good and is quite tough. When solar watches first came into the market, <br />they were very fragile and quite inefficient. Not so any more.  <br />The technology has vastly improved. <br /> <br />This watch is Made in China. In earlier days Casio watches were Made in Japan. <br />I found this watch to be of the same quality. <br /> <br />The only thing that I do not like about Casio watches is that the strap breaks after a  <br />period of time.
B00015TOCY|5.0|It's cliche to refer to a musician as \\"ahead of their time\\", but Eno was certainly ahead of mine. I bought the LP version of this when it first came out, and while I enjoyed it, I feel like only now do I finally \\"get it\\". Eno has created such a deep volume of work between his pop records, his ambient work and of course his production for U2 and others that his talent should be obvious. This record, however, has always been at the top of my list. To my ear it was good then and it's great now. Artists from Doug Hilsinger to Shivaree have covered his songs, but none of them can create the soundscapes that Eno did. If you only buy one Eno record in your lifetime, let this be it.
B000089RVR|4.0|Very good for a \\"sophomore\\" album, since many singers seem to collapse on the second album.
0385512104|5.0|When I say this book is simply written, I don't mean that it is a simple book.  Bits of wisdom practically leap from every page as we are drawn into the world of an unlikely hero.  I was deeply affected by the trials and tribulations of Christopher, a fifteen-year-old austitic boy.  I will say there is a twist and from about page 100, you really start to root for him and are saddened by some of the things that happen to him--because Lord knows, he wouldn't have chosen this whole autism thing for himself.  But, you never feel sorry for him and as the reader you go along living Christopher's life with him and you hope that he can see five red cars in a row so that it can be a Super Good Day.<br /><br />This book is fresh and original and I hope that there are many more written by Mark Haddon.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This is a classic soaper, and it re-established Joan Crawford as THE leading lady of the day (both Barbara Stanwyck and Bette Davis turned down the role). Crawford sits in the police station ready to take the rap for her rotten daughter's (played by Ann Blyth) killing of her (Crawford's) husband (Zachary Scott). In a series of flashbacks the story unfolds: how Crawford has to take lousy jobs to support her daughter; how she meets Scott and marries him; how he has an affair with Blyth, which leads to his murder. I can't think of a more despicable character than that played by Blyth, the selfishness and meanness of her is incredible. And the way Crawford bends to her ways, despite her daughter's open ungratefullness, is excruciating to see. The acting is superb all around, the script (based on the James Cain novel) sizzles. A noir masterpiece.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen and since it ranks as one of my favorite movies, I decided to let others know.  I'm a big fan of horror/thrillers and I really enjoyed this movie.  I won't tell you any details because I think it's better to not know almost everything that happens, like some reviewers write.  I'm not saying there's something wrong with people doing that, but I'd rather just give my opinion and of course not everyone will agree with it.  I would recommend watching this if you're into suspense thrillers.  There's alot of gore in it, so if you're not into that, I'd stay away from it.  lol  I hope you like it as much as I did and let me know if this was helpful!
B00004TJKI|5.0|This is an excellent courtroom drama. Ben Gazzara is an army lieutenant accused of murdering a bartender who reportedly beat up and raped his wife (Lee Remick). James Stewart and George C. Scott are the two lawyers who battle it out in court--Stewart for the defense. Stewart shows the bartender to be a victimizer of women, all in his \\"gee-whiz\\" style. Fast paced and very well done. Duke Ellington wrote the music which adds greatly to the movie's sophistication.
B000002JS6|5.0|Imagine that Mick Jagger or Bono or Axl Rose or Eddie Vedder died and their respective bands decided to find a replacement and make another album. What are the chances that they would make not only the best-selling album of their careers, but also the best? That's the trick AC/DC accomplished with Back in Black. Released in August 1980, only half a year after singer Bon Scott fatally choked on his own vomit, hard rock's second-best-selling album of all time (after Led Zeppelin's fourth) is both fitting tribute and raucous wake. Like much of Def Leppard's back catalog, Back in Black was produced by the future Mr. Shania Twain, Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange. But unlike Def Leppard's quintessential Eighties products Pyromania and Hysteria, the Australian quintet's follow-up to its 1979 breakthrough Highway to Hell still sounds thoroughly timeless, the essence of unrepentantly simple but savagely crafted hard rock.  <br />From the vengeful death knell of \\"Hell's Bells\\" to the strutting finale of \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution,\\" the rhythms on this album do not relent. Neither does the screeching of Scott's successor, Brian Johnson. Nearly everything is beat and scream, explosion and release. Unleashed while New Wave was reasserting rock as dance music, this monument of clean rock sonics and dirty impulses makes a strong case for headbanging, but a better argument for a full-body party. <br /> <br />Brothers Malcolm and Angus Young play their guitars in such close tandem that they seem synced by the same churning organism. As chords bang and pummel, bassist Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd drag and push the beat with such steady fluctuations that the result is one continuous, well-oiled throttle. As titles such as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" proclaim, Back in Black is a celebration of thrashing, animal sex. It's also a wince-inducing spew of mean-spirited sexism, particularly during the one-two bitch slap of \\"What Do You Do for Money Honey\\" and \\"Given the Dog a Bone.\\"Johnson misinterprets Scott's sass as contempt, just as gangsta rap would turn thug love into something ugly. If Back in Black someday does sound dated, let it be for this sole mistake. <br />
B00000IPAX|5.0|Just get this cd...it has such classics as \\"What's My Age Again?\\", \\"All the Small Things,\\" and \\"Adam's Song.\\" <br />Some people criticize blink for \\"All the Small Things\\" being too \\"poppy\\"- but it was a song for his girlfriend- take it for what it is- a fast, fun, enjoyable song. <br />Pretty much unknown tracks such as \\"Dysentery Gary,\\" \\"Wendy Clear\\", and \\"Going Away to College\\" are superb songs totally deserving of your ears. <br />You shan't be disappointed...go buy this classic.
B0000029GA|5.0|On Broadway, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) remains as hot as August concrete and Doggystyle as cold as ice - meaning that Dre and Snoop will not be returning as the Man. But the race ain't over, as a horde of major albums have recently been released or are slated for the last half of '94: Ice Cube and Dr. Dre's Helter Skelter, Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth's The Main Ingredients, Coolio's It Takes a Thief and Shyheim's AKA the Rugged Child, as well as albums from Smif n' Wessun, Redman, 2Pac, the Lady of Rage, the Method Man, Rakim and a solo album by A Tribe Called Quest's Phife. But they'll all be chasing the MC with a street buzz so loud it's threatening to silence the Death Row bass thump on Broadway: Nas. <br /> <br />The humming began once the hottest producers in New York - DJ Premier, Pete Rock, the Large Professor, Q-Tip, L.E.S. - completed their parts on Illmatic, and Nas stepped to their tracks (many smooth and mellow, a few hard and biting, all mid- to low-tempo) and vaulted himself into the elite group of MCs. Not because of an ultrabutter flow and boldly distinctive voice like Q-Tip or Slick Rick but because of sharp articulation, finely detailed lyrics and a controlled tone reminiscent of Rakim. Those sounds and Nas' no-nonsense urban tales pair Ill's every beautiful moment with its harsh antithesis. From \\"One Love,\\" Nas' letter to homies in jail - \\"So, stay civilized/Time flies/Though, incarcerated, your mind dies/I hate it when your moms cries/It kinda makes me wanna murder\\" - to the end of \\"Life's a Bitch,\\" when his father, Olu Dara, steps in over the beat with a muted trumpet, searching for the tone with which Nas expressed the futility of his life, it's all like a rose stretching up between cracks in the sidewalk, calling attention to its beauty, calling attention to the lack of it everywhere else. <br /> <br />But bop and swerve as they may, in colder regions a West Coast backlash might be in effect: The wild success of Wu-Tang and their inexpensive sound, coupled with the surprisingly mild aesthetic impact of Death Row's Above the Rim soundtrack (not to mention Regulate, by Warren G, Dre's little brother), signal that Dre's hegemony may be ending. That's why Nas' timing, like his cadence, is so dope. He's not as underground sounding as Wu-Tang, yet he does spring from and aspires to impress the hood. <br /> <br />But to assume that the ghetto in him - Queensbridge projects, Queens, N.Y. - makes him great is to get way too wrapped up in hip-hop's realness debate. No matter how rough you had it and how authentically you portray it, it'll be MC skills - the distinctiveness of your voice, the adeptness of your rhythm and flow, the quality of your lyrics - that will ultimately determine if you move the crowd. <br /> <br />The Wu crew opened a door for Nas, reminding Broadway how good New York-style beats and lyrics - as opposed to West Coast sinister funk and slow, gangsta rhymes - could be. Illmatic will probably be Broadway's album of the year, not for the real life behind its dedication to 13 dead homies but for the work on the CD. If an MC's history were really more important than his skills, then anyone from the projects would be able to rhyme like Nas, and Nas would be no different from any bum riding down Broadway.  <br />
B0007NFL1S|1.0|This pretentious collection of \\"made for radio\\" rap is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The once thought provoking and lyrically adventerous rhymes of 50 Cent have yet to be found on this album. Offered from the newcomer with fading potential are dirty lymerics of self indulging tripe, sexual deviance, and poor humor. The musical growth rate of 50 Cent cannot even be charted. He is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|After reading the reviews online I was a little hestitant about seeing the movie afterall, it's common sense that the sequel to any good movie never really turns out the way you want it too... but, in this case I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is what fans of Bridget have waited for-<br /><br />What happens after happily ever after we all wonder when we see the end to any movie and in this one we get the chance to see a piece of what becomes between the buff Bridget and her \\"perfect\\" boyfriend Mark-- who folds his underwear before he goes to sleep. In this reality strikes their relationship as Bridget and Mark deal with snobby/single friends, lesbian kisses, Thai prisons, break-ups, family, weekends spent away together, and work-- also a beautiful young secretary with long legs who happens to work with Mark. Of course, as in any squel there is a comeback by Daniel Cleaver who everywhere Bridget turns manages to see his face as he has just landed himself his own television show and is the same as ever-- and still going after Bridget. Can Bridget and Mark manage to survie??? Well I think we all know the answer to that.<br /><br />Colin Firth is more charming in this as Mark Darcy than he was in the first and of course, Renee does a wonderful job as the buff Brit who never seems to get anything right. Hugh Grant is davishly evil and once again you see that wonderful on-screen rivalry between Hugh and Firth.<br /><br />This was the film I have been waiting for after seeing the words \\"the beginning\\" in Bridget Jone's Diary... and I loved seeing Bridg and Mark together. I found myself swooning after Mark who likes Bridget-- \\"likes her just the way she is\\"--wobbly bits included... what girl dosn't want a man like Mark? And Bridget maintains to be the symbol of all woman- slightly overweight and wanting wedding bells to dong.<br /><br />This is a movie for fans and a must see for any Colin Firth or Hugh Grant fan. All in all rent this one or do what I'm doing and buy this one!and buy this one!  <br />

B0007O38F8|4.0|Alright I've read all the hating in the reviews. But what all y'all didn't seem to note is that 50 Cent has never been all that lyrical.  50 Cent is an great song writer, he's the only rapper today that does all his hooks (it's different from ja rule because fifty is still rapping in the hooks not singing).  The point is hate on the lyrics all you want but this is a CD that you can listen to all the way from track 2 to 22 in your car.  Which is what you can't say for most of the rappers out there. So don't get on dude because he does his own hooks, because other rappers just get R & B Chicks to do the same thing. He just keeping the money in the camp. So listen to the music and stop hating cause he doesn't say \\"like\\", and talk about his \\"ice\\" alot. Cause I garantee that you will remember all those hooks, the bounce your head along the way.

B000002KCI|5.0|zuma is another masterpiece from neil and crazy horse. in fact all of neil young's stuff from the seventies is awesome. zuma is a little more of a rocker than on the beach or tonight's the night with guitar tracks like dangerbird and cortez the killer, then throw in a few acoustic ballads and you got perfection. i got zuma last in my neil seventies vinyl collection and was not disappointed, in fact i listen to zuma more than all the others. on a saturday morning, listen to everybody knows this nowhere, harvest, after the goldrush, times fades away, on a beach, tonight's the night, then zuma, and don't forget comes a time from 1978, now your listening to neil's best stuff.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I do not care how many albums Green Day Sales they will never be as good as the clash and i really do not like the Clash. In the American Idiot movie the spray themselves with green paint. This album has many pop hard rock songs like the clash. Plus Politics this is the main reason i hate this album if i wanted politics i would watch cnn i like my rock and roll fun not serious. I actually liked green day when on Dookie [...] if you like education is not needed green day sucks no but at least their music is not annoying(ei emo s****)
B000001ELR|1.0|I am a huge classic (original lineup) KISS fan. However, this album fails in comparison to the other previous gems. As a kid and as an adult when I updated my collection to cd I thought Ace was on this album. But when I read the liner notes and part of the KISSTORY book I found out Ace had nothing to do with these sessions!!!!<br /><br />What a scam to consumers and fans to put Ace on the cover and in the \\"Love it Loud\\" video in the 80s when he wasn't even a part of it!!!!! False advertising!!!!!<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money with this album!!! Not worth it!!!!
077106506X|5.0|There is a wonderful strength and survivorship in the girls and women of RUNAWAY.  I was reminded of the similar themes and womans point of view from the ubiquitous and fantastic CHILDRENS CORNER by Jackson McCrae, even though that author is a guy. Youd think that Munro and McCrae are related in the way they handle the sensitivity of situations and people.  But Munros work is really without comparison, for she manages to connect several of the stories and the result is a tour-de-force of emotion and intellect.  The reader is captured by the style and what happens in the stories is not as important as how those happenings are revealed. A great writer and a great book. Dont miss it!
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel has always made great music throughout his 30 year career. But undoubtedly his best material, both commerically and creatively, were his first 10 years (1975-85). 1985's \\"Greatest Hits Volume 1 & Volume II\\". You can't go wrong with two discs from this amzing period in Billy's career, when he was at the top of his game.<br /><br />Basically what you get on these two discs are all of Billy's big hit singles up to 1985, including \\"Piano Man\\", \\"Just The Way You Are\\", \\"My Life\\", \\"You May Be Right\\", \\"It's Still Rock And Roll To Me\\", \\"Tell Her About It\\" and \\"Uptown Girl\\" . Also you get some of his best album tracks as well, including \\"Captain Jack\\", \\"The Entertainer\\", \\"New York State Of The Mind\\", \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\" and \\"The Stranger\\". All of these songs are excellent rock and pop numbers that deserve the praise they so often get. When this collection was first released in 1985, two new songs, \\"You're Only Human (Second Wind)\\" and \\"The Night Is Still Young\\", were inclued and became singles, with the former song going to number nine on the charts, becoming Billy's eighth top 10 single in 10 years.<br /><br />This is an amazing compilation of Billy's best songs. You can also pick up volume three, which has some great music on it. But please get this one. You will not be sorry.
B00005JNNL|4.0|\\"The Sea Inside\\" (Mar Adentro) is a quiet movie with just enough wit and humor to make the central story bearable: Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) wants to end his life because his life was cut off, though he continues to live, in a diving accident some 28 years before, turning him into a paraplegic, only able to move his head.<br /><br />For most of the 28 years that he has been in this state, he has made the most of it: writing, developing a close relationship with his nephew, his sister-in-law and his father, who all help to care for him<br /><br />But by the beginning of the movie he has had enough, he wants out and that means he wants to die.<br /><br />Though his role here is not as showy as that in \\"Before Night Falls,\\" Bardem manages to paint the portrait of a man who despises his \\"existence\\" and tries everything he can, through legal means to do something about it. Ramon is full of life and love and through flashbacks you see that he had great friends and one great love...all gone now.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Amenabar has fashioned a film full of humanity and humor: though Ramon's situation is dire he manages to laugh and fall in love with not one but two women and they with him.<br /><br />But ultimately, \\"The Sea Inside\\" is about how far the government can intrude upon our personal lives and how little power we have over our own bodies. There is a play and a movie title from years ago that seems apt here: \\"Whose Life Is It Anyway?\\"
B000002OX7|5.0|This album is unbelievable.  Way ahead of it's time as far as the production and texturing of the songs.  You get the well known tunes Baba Oreilly, Won't Get Fooled Again, Behind Blue Eyes, Mobile and some lesser known tunes that are just as good like Love Ain't For Keeping and My Wife.  The Song is Over and Getting In Tune are two of the best rock ballads ever.  Pete Townsend doesn't have the greatest voice but his vocals are perfect on The Song is Over.  This is one of my all time favorite CDs.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Mein Herz Brennt 5/5: it grows on you, but only after a while,  <br /> <br />Links 2-3-4 5/5: Fabulous! I just wanna start marching when i hear this ;) great to work out to  <br /> <br />Sonne 7/5: I've loved this song sooooo much ever since i first heard it! i was crushed when i found out the beautiful female vocal is just a key on Flakes piano! Besides that; its superb; this album should have been  called Sonne! <br /> <br />Ich Will 5/5: I love this song! the feedback from the audience is fantastic & even more so live!! The video is brilliant as well! <br /> <br />Feuer Frei! 2/5:  if this song didn't remind me of vin deisel i'd probably like it,  <br /> <br />Mutter 5/5: Beautiful! I adore this song!!! It's not as fast as some, but it's one of the best!  <br /> <br />Spieluhr 6/5: one of my fave songs of the album! amazing! & somewhat sad!

B000089RVX|4.0|All I can say is what a voice Amy Lee has.  Haunting and beautiful at the same time.  I don't mean to knock the rest of the band or the quality of the songs, but this would probably be a two star cd without Amy's vocal.  She makes what would be mediocre material at best something more.  She really carries this CD.
B0000035E7|5.0|This Nirvana album of course was the first album to start up their careers.  Although this album wasant as famous as their others, such as \\"Nevermind\\".  It is still raw, and shows that Nirvana will never sell-out.  This is probably the only CD you can get to know the real direction Kurt Cobain was trying to head when starting a band.  If your only into Nirvana songs on the Greatest Hits, I suggest not purchasing this CD.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Blink 182 has got to be the worst band of all time.  What's My Age Again was the first song I heard by these guys and I thought it was pretty good.  After I heard the rest of their crap I'd had enough.  This is bubble gum punk. Should be used for torture treatments.

B00000JPH6|5.0|I remember my mom popping this in the vcr when I was about four years old.  Talk about nightmares.  I couldn't bring myself to watch this movie for a long time, until recently I went out and bought it for my daughter.  I know that it sounds like I'm contradicting myself when I say that it would scare a child, but I went and bought one for mine, but she loves it!!  Also, after getting over my irrational, and ridiculous, fear of this movie, I watched it with her and ended up looking at it like an adult would.  The puppetry is excellent, the best of Jim Henson, and for the time that this was produced, it is astonishingly very well in effects.  It will still scare the pants off of any *normal* child, (which mine is, but she seems to like monsters and stuff!!) but is great if you like classic fantasy movies.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I can say no more than that this is the best album i've ever been blessed to listen to. Here are the songs in order of their quality. <br /> <br />1) And All Things Will End <br />2) Unholy Confessions <br />3) I Won't See You Tonight pt2 <br />4) Eternal rest <br />5) I Won't See You Tonight pt1 <br />6) Desecrate Through Reverance <br />7) Second Heartbeat <br />8) Chapter Four <br />9) Clairvoyant Disease <br />10) Waking The Fallen <br />11) Reminissions <br />12) Radiant Eclipse <br /> <br />Enjoy this album, i don't think you'll ever hear anything greater than this. Amazing riffs, drums, screams, singing, pace changes. It is pure perfection.
B00005NOOH|5.0|The World at War is the 26-part series of hour long shows, each focusing on an important aspect of WW2.  I remember seeing this on PBS in the '70s with the intense intro of WW2 victims' faces superimposed in flames and the great music of Carl Davis.  Many of the shows are narrated by Laurence Olivier and end with footage which ends in an affecting still and Davis' music.<br /><br />  All episodes are important, and here are a few of the ones that come to mind:  \\"Alone\\"--This one shows the period between the fall of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union, how only one single country in the world stood up to Nazi Germany, as Gary Cooper in High Noon.  That country of course was Great Britain led by Winston Churchill.  Had it not been for Britain, the world would have been plunged into total darkness.<br /><br />  \\"Genocide\\"--depicts the Holocaust, and as producer Jeremy Isaacs says in the intro, this was not part of the military aspect of the War, but showed what the war was a cover for.  The DVD has an expanded version of this called \\"The Final Solution\\".<br />  \\"Stalingrad\\" and \\"Barbarossa\\" depict the Soviet part of the war, a part usually not emphasized enough, as 2/3 of all German forces were in the East.  Some have criticized the series for not emphasizing the Pacific War, which is true, for the decision was made to concentrate on Europe, but a few episodes such as \\"The Bomb\\" and \\"Japan 1941-45\\" are included.  Another important one is \\"Inside the Reich\\", a rare look inside Nazi Germany.  And it should be said that Germany was on one level the first victim of Naziism.<br />  Forget Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.  If you want to know the real story, get this collection, \\"The World at War\\".
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Absolutely beautiul. A Perfect Circle's sophomore album proves that creativity, originality, and intrigue can still be found in today's music. This album is not like Mer De Noms, although that CD is definitely as praise-worthy as 13th Step. 13th Step is more refined and introspective. It shows a vast range of human emotion, going from desperation to hope and optimism. The songs are prime examples of how it is possible for the human being to suffer and figuratively die, only to renew himself and emerge into enlightenment. Here is my breakdown of the CD: <br /> <br />The Package (10/10) - This song is a masterpiece. It starts out simple, with an eerie, haunting aura and gradually grows into a powerful performance that will blow you away. Maynard's vocals in this song are very sincere and compelling. <br /> <br />Weak and Powerless (9/10) - First song I heard from this album. The drums and bass blend perfectly. The whole sound of this song captures its title to a T. You can definitely feel the sadness and helplessness within. <br /> <br />The Noose (9/10) - Like The Package, this song starts out quiet and simple and grows into a work of art. It is captivating and the lyrics are extremely thoughtful. <br /> <br />Blue (10/10) - Wow. Can you say AMAZING?! The guitars in this song are unbelievably intricate and skillfully put together. I love the vocals, drums, bass line, EVERYTHING. <br /> <br />Vanishing (100000000000/10) - Definitely my favorite song on the album. Actually, this is my favorite song out of every song I've ever heard in my entire life. The lyrics are strange but that is not what makes this song. I can't even describe it..just the feeling of this song is amazing and so incredibly relaxing. To get the full effect of \\"Vanishing\\" you MUST see it performed live. Totally captivated me. <br /> <br />A Stranger (7/10) - Nice song. It's slow and thoughtful, with its unhurried guitar and smooth vocals.  <br /> <br />The Outsider (10/10) - One of the harder songs on the album. Amazing lyrics go well with intimidating music - Maynard makes his point with this song.  <br /> <br />Crimes (7/10) - Not sure what to make of this song. Frankly, it almost scares the hell out of me when I really listen to it. The vocals are creepy and the music is even creepier. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 .... <br /> <br />The Nurse Who Loved Me (6/10) - This is a cover song. I don't particularly like it, but I listen to it just because Maynard's voice is gorgeous and makes the song worth listening to at least a few times. <br /> <br />Pet (10/10) - What a way to break away from the slower songs in this album! When \\"Pet\\" starts, it's almost startling. It's the hardest song on the album and done so well. The deep, angry guitar riffs along with the powerful drums and the evocative vocals bring out the meaning behind the song. Really pay attention to the lyrics, they can really teach you something. <br /> <br />Lullaby (7/10) - Creepy follow up to Pet. It's short and sort of like Crimes in that it scares me.  <br /> <br />Gravity (10/10) - What a beautiful way to end this album. Mellow and enthralling, this song shows the optimism on 13th Step. Remember the closing lyrics to this - \\"I choose to live...\\" <br /> <br />All in all, if you're searching for music so brilliantly put together it'll take your breath away, look no further. A Perfect Circle knows how to incorporate the ideal mixture of remarkable music with thought-provoking lyrics to prove just how deep the mind can go..
B00005JN0T|3.0|Alas, it is very hard to find great sci-fi these days.  This story takes some of Asimov's ideas - the three laws of robotics, which Asimov posited would be inevitable with the advent of intelligent robots - and jazzes them up with special effects while missing the underlieing point (i.e. that the positronic brian is designed so that robots cannot violate them - the three laws can't be turned off without destroying the function of the positronic brain itself).  That makes this rather feeble as sci-fi, but good enough for casual viewers who want action and images, which seem all that Hollywood is capable of these days.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly.  You can't watch this like 2001 and constantly see more and differently - once you get it, the concept is used up, as is the case with simple who-donnits.

0767834739|1.0|this is probally one of the most stupid movies i have ever seen. the first one was actually good, this movie was so fake and stupid.
B00030590I|5.0|Without a doubt, \\"Hero\\" was absolutely the finest movie of it's genre that I've ever experienced.  The filming locations in China were breathtaking providing for intense visual eye candy.  The panoramic cinematography was exquisite.  The beautifully crafted story was woven around masterfully choreographed martial arts and sword fighting sequences.<br /><br />Jet Li playing the character Nameless, is an unquestioned nonpareil of martial arts skills.  He is the hero named in the movie title.  Before the creation of what we now know as China, the land was a conglomeration of 7 warring provinces.  The most powerful of which was called Qin.  The king of Qin possessed a vision of the unification of these provinces.  Of course this dream was not shared by all.<br /><br />Li, born in the rival province of Zhao, was orphaned and adopted into a family in Qin.  Ten years of rigorous training honed him into the finest swordsman in all of the Qin province.  He had vanquished three of the most deadly assassins who had been plaguing the king of Qin, in order to gain his confidence.  His ultimate aspiration was to assassinate the king himself.  The three assassins known as Sky, Broken Sword and Snow, also martial arts experts helped structure Li's resolve to attain his goal.<br /><br />This Quentin Tarantino sponsored martial arts masterpiece, expertly directed by Yimou Zhang, was both a powerful and sensually appealing cinematic experience.
B00005QK3W|2.0|Considering one of his best albums came before it 'Flaming Pie', this is a very weak effort. It lacks the acoustic and melodic sounf of that album and tries to rock too much. 'Lonely road' 'Driving rain' all these songs are boring rock tunes.  <br />Even some of the ballads are weak- I don't like 'Froma lover to a friend' meandering and tuneless.  <br />The only songs to recommend this release are 'tiny bubble' which has a few nice chord changes, the romantic 'I do' which is what Macca does best, 'Your loving flame' is ok and the best song on the album is the wonderful 'Heather'. <br />The last two tracks are, quite frankly painful. 'Rinse the raindrops' is so boring and pure over indulgence even from a Beatle. And 'Freedom' is absolutely terrible and as bas as 'give peace a chance', actually, probably even worse. <br />A huge let down.
B0002SROT0|5.0|It's unfortunate that Elliott Smith is no longer with us, because this album, the first one I've heard from him (and from what I've sampled of previous albums, exceptionally better than his others) shows evidence of the kind of musical genius, depth, and profundity that comes only a few times in a generation, and which is often tragically associated with an untimely death.<br /><br />It's well known that Smith was fascinated and influenced by The Beatles- it's also common that musical artists so influenced by The Beatles turn out cliche, simplifed versions of their melodic and chordal fingerprints (e.g. Jellyfish and even John's son Julian Lennon)- Smith not only avoids this fate, but triumphs with similar incomprehensibly stimulating tones.  I caught a bit of Paul McCartney live at the 2005 Superbowl, and the same old songs' melodic twists and unconventional structures still amaze me.  Smith is in the same class.<br /><br />These songs drip with powerful darkness, twist with irony, implore your consideration, and moan a brilliant gloom.  Echoes and minor impressions of Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and George Harrison are also evident.<br /><br />Most importantly, I have listened to this album at least 30 times over the last few months, and continue to crave it.  The total span of tracks is deep enough for even a widely listened musician to enjoy and examine over and over.<br /><br />With entertainers who have died young, whatever the cause, there tends to be a fascination with what they could have achieved next, had they lived.  This kind of idol worship can, at times, magnify an artist's accomplishments beyond deserved levels.  In Smith's case, he was not sufficiently famous to become a Jimi Hendrix or Kurt Cobain- but even on the personal level, the knowledge of his death, for me, is part of the story of the album, something that haunts and enlightens the experience of each song.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When Christina Aguilera's video for her first single \\"Dirrty\\" it became undeniable that she has grown tremendously since her Mickey Mouse Club days.  It's not just her obvious image that has changed, her voice has moved from a mind blowing little girl's voice to a mind blowing woman's voice.  After the first listen through the album, heck, after the third track, my mouth dropped in astonishment.  Stripped is a perfect showcase of talent and truth.<br /><br />Hardly anything in this album is bad, every track shows her vocal talents (except for most of the interludes).  It starts off with the commercial \\"Stripped (Intro)\\" which leads onto her women empowerment 4th single \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" where rap diva Lil' Kim makes a cameo.  But track 3 \\"Walk Away\\" is where she strikes pure gold, and my personal favorite track.  It's a beautiful ballad that gave me goose bumps my first listen.<br /><br />But the album doesn't stop there.  It's raunchy (\\"Dirrty\\"), uplifting (\\"Beautiful\\"), seductive (\\"Infatuation\\"), and sensual (\\"Impossible\\", also composed by Alicia Keys).  This album shows talent I never knew Miss Aguilera had.  This cd has definitely made me a fan of this amazing talent.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|At this low price, I can safely recommend this disc to anyone who was a casual fan of \\"Deloused\\". Since I've deprogrammed myself out of the typical 3 minute-a-track music I'm more accustomed to, I've begun to appreciate this band much more.     Not that it's perfect by any means. I would enjoy it a lot more if it was just tightened up around the edges. There is a lot of musical rambling in between tracks that can get irratating if you just are in the mood for some quick rocking. A bit more looser than \\"Deloused.\\" It's an epic, listen to it as one - one sitting, all the way through, then a second time.     But once you get passed the musical rambling (if it's even an issue for you, I'm sure many still enjoy it) it's definitley a solid work. The sheer versatility of musical styles is remarkable and quite different from anything you'll hear on the radio. I absolutely agree with another reviewer (Dominic) who described it as a mix of Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana and Pink Floyd. And at the lower price, you can't go wrong. \\"Deloused\\" and \\"Frances\\" complement each other very well, and if you like one, you'll probably enjoy the other.
B000002KDZ|5.0|This is a great album of great songs.  They could have been done by Santana, but they are longer and more fluid.  The music style is closest to Santana's Caravanserai, but a little lighter.  The CD is about 44 minutes long and the sound quality is fairly good.    When Santana hit it big, there were many copiers, as the record labels tried to find the next big latino band.  Malo was the best of the Santana wannabe's.    Although this is not an important album and it is copying someone else's music style, I still give it 5 stars because it so good on many levels.    Malo featured Carlos Santana's brother, Jorge, on guitar.  Other prominent members include Louis Gasca, would go on to a solo career in jazz fusion and Richard Kermode, a phenominal keyboardist who would join Santana during the Caravanserai days.    Malo had a richer sound than Santana and featured more brass instruments.  They put out very enjoyable music.  However, there music was not as powerful and the songs were not as meaningful as Santana's.       Malo recorded 5 albums before breaking up in 1980.  Some of the original members left before the breakup.  Malo, has \\"reformed\\" a number of times since then.  The only remaining original member is the lead singer.  Malo is currently active and playing in small places like art and wine festivals (they recently played at a Tamale festival.)
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I saw this band in concert and was blown away. Words cannot express how happy i am to tell you that this was one of the best albums i have ever heard. This album was not as good as Iwoa, or Self Titled, but how could it be. Slipknot has built an empirer that will take years to calm down, but for now....SLipknot Kickes!
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Having read some Shangri-La reviews, I wonder why some still want to compare this album and other MK's solo efforts with his Dire Straits albums. I understand that some are still searching for Mark Knopfler's Dire Straits guitar solos and may not be interested in a laid-back effort as Shangri-La. The man has grown older and his music has flourished and matured by age. When Shangri-La was released I didn't hesitate to buy it immediately and on the first listen I was absolutely amazed. I loved his previous effort 'The Ragpicker's Dream' as well but that album was too country for Mark Knopfler except the excellent 'Why Aye Man', 'Fare Thee Well Northumberland' and 'You Don't Know You're Born'. With Shangri-La however Mark delivers a rockier sound evident on numbers such as 'Boom, Like That' and 'Song For Sonny Liston'. He plays more lead guitars than Ragpicker's Dream and isn't affraid to tell stories about Krac, Liston, Presley and others. His playing is mature and the band including Richard Bennett, Guy Fletcher, Chad Cromwell and Glenn Worf accompany him better than ever. Other Standout tracks are: The Trawlerman's Song, 5:15 AM, Our Shagri-La and the beautiful Don't Crash The Ambulance. Few artits today can combine style with emotion and awareness. Mark Knopfler's is a master and Shangri-La deserves attention. Thumbs up for the Master!

B000059T1E|5.0|JOHN BARLEYCORN MUST DIE is certainly traffics most popular, if not its best album.  Released in the fall of 1970, the album reached No. 5 in the U.S. and became the group's first stateside gold record. The album began as a Steve Winwood solo album (tentatively entitled MAD SHADOWS) following the breakup of Blind Faith.  Winwood had already recorded three tracks (\\"Stranger to Himself,\\" \\"Every Mothers Son\\" and \\"Sittin' Here Thinkin' of My Love\\"--the latter included as a bonus track on this remastered edition along with the previously unreleased \\"I Just Want You to Know\\") before inviting Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi to join the sessions, making it a Traffic reunion album. [Dave Mason continued his solo career and did not participate, although he did rejoin briefly in 1971 during the recording of WELCOME TO THE CANTEEN.]<br /><br />The three already completed songs are pretty much left untouched with Winwood playing all instruments, but Capaldi provides additional vocals on \\"Stranger to Himself\\" and drums to the other two tracks. The centerpiece of this collection is the six-minute-plus performance of the traditional folk song \\"John Barleycorn.\\" The song has been covered by other groups of the period--Jethro Tull, Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span--but this is the definitive version. It could have been a huge single.  Instead, \\"Empty Pages\\" was the album's only single, which peaked at No. 74. Overall, this is an excellent album.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000089RV6|1.0|Back in black is the best rocknroll album period.This &#34;digi pack&#34; is a ripoff though.The cd side of the disc is poor quality,it sounds like they remastered it with too much compression trying to make it sound more analog.The dvd side has a cool documentary and a high quality version of the audio cd but you can only play the hq version on your dvd player...?I also bought the remastered &#34;for those about to rock&#34; cd and its crisper but somone got a little overboard with the low end and you have to cut it with your eq.Save yourself some money and buy the older pre-remaster 16bit cds.I have the older cd and they sound better than the cd side of the digipack.
0425173739|5.0|So far Death on the nile is my favorite agatha Christie book I've read. It's very fast paced and exicting. every time you think you've got a clue it's all thrown off by another thing. As soon as the book starts to get boring \\"Bang!\\" another thing happens. I would definetly recomend this book.
B000002ILG|3.0|To begin I have to tell you that Vito Bratta is one very talented guitarist,it is a shame he got stuck using a singer that sounds like a scratch across a chalk board!But this is White Lion!If you can listen past the vocals there is a lot of talent here.Almost every song has some very tough guitar work. <br />1.Hungry(10/10)Best song on this album.Listen to the guitar intro.You have to admit that Vito is a great talent.His solo's and rhythm guitar work are great. <br />2.Lonely Nights(9/10)This one has more great guitar work.It's only the voclas that weigh this down a bit. <br />3.Don't Give Up(6/10)This would be great,but Tramp's vocals are so whinning it gets on my nerves! <br />4.Sweet Little Loving(5/10)Bad song.The vocals are so bad.I wonder how Tramp ever got into the music business! <br />5.Lady of the Valley(10/10)Wow!Listen to the guitar work.Vitto can play like no other.He has his own great style.With this song it's easy to get past the vocals.The vocals don't sound half bad on this one! <br />6.Wait(4/10)Cringe inducing song.Don't play this in your car,you just might attract some unwanted attention,if you know what I mean! <br />7.All You Need Is Rock n Roll(3/10)Horrible song.Bad,bad,Bad! <br />8.Tell Me(6/10)More of the same.Not the worst though. <br />9.All Join Our Hands(6/10)Has some more talented guitar work,but that's about it. <br />10.When the Children Cry(1/10)I hate this Fu*kin song.I could never understand why this was such a big hit.It is so gay and it just sucks!Plain and simple garbage! <br />Overall if you want a hair metal album for your collection,then this is worth picking up for a small price of 4 bucks or so. <br />If you wnt to hear the real White Lion I say buy there first album titled Fight to Survive.You will be suprised how good that album is,but it is quite hard to find so good luck! <br />
B00008ADPF|5.0|I think this Nickelback album is really good, I saw them live in Amsterdam twice and the kicked some major ass! Why be mad that they play the same type of music, it's what they are good at. If they went totally pop they would suck.  <br />Nickelback should this keep playing this type of music, and you all should stop complaining, this cd was great!!! <br /> <br />
B0000QX0XI|5.0|I wrote a review for the original Adrenalize album and so I won't make this too long.  I will say that this CD is very underrated and it deserves a lot more respect than people give it.  This is REAL ROCK people!!!  Songs like Let's Get Rocked, Make Love Like A Man, White Lightning, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad (the 2nd best rock ballad ever next to Love Bites), Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion), Tonight, Tear It Down and every other song is awesome!!!  I love this CD and it will always be one of my fav's!!!  Def Leppard ROCKS!!!!
B00003CXCW|5.0|One of Billy Wilder's best has finally been given the DVD presentation it deserves. The video and audio have both been meticulously restored, elevating this classic to pristine \\"like new\\" condition. The extras are expansive and well-worth the price alone. Buy this DVD...you definitely won't regret it!
0066214122|1.0|Starting off with a tiny modicum of facts, Senor C. spins off a thriller.  Lots of last-second escapes from death!    Woo hoo!! <br /> <br />Only problem is the premises are mighty strained-- you have to suspend so much disbelief, your arms get tired at about page 20.   <br /> <br />Apparently Mr. C thinks you can build tiny computers smaller than a blood cell, and solar panels that small can intercept enough light to power the computer AND power wings.  And he and his charactes never realize they could jsut spray a water hose ofther these things and they'd be stuck in the water due to surface tension, just like dust is. <br /> <br />And of course his characters have no character, they're just vehicles for the plot. <br /> <br />And he dislikes women. <br /> <br />Real stinker of a book, went in the trash can.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This classic film-noir is a must-see! The acting, writing and direction are stellar, and the DVD version is bright, clear and sharp {unlike the video version, which was murky and looked as though it was shot through fog}. The extras, including trailers from other Crawford films and a 90-minute documentary about Joan, are fantastic. My only complaints are the flimsy cardboard DVD case and the lack of art on the disc {a 2-disc set in a sturdy plastic case would've been better}. However, the current version of this DVD is nicely priced for what you get, and well-worth the investment.
0060989157|5.0|Now I remember, I was there in the 1980's. I remember I had a Crue t-shirt that I totally ragged out. I remember watching M TV and Girls, Girls Girls would come on. I really enjoyed reading this book and reliving much of what was fun about the 80's. There was booze, there was drugs, and there was sex. Some of the stories seem a bit far fetched, but that is why they are so good. Just sit back, pour a glass of the good stuff (we don't drink out of the botle any more do we?), and enjoy this read.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|The special effects are undeniably impressive. But it seems to me the movie is groundbreaking only in the sense that it uses MORE computer graphics than earlier films, not necessarily better ones. In other words, this movie could have dazzled everyone if it had been the first to use these techniques -- instead of just using a bigger quantity of them. <br />So what's left is the acting and the story, and neither was exceptional. So I found myself fast-forwarding through parts of this film, and feeling un-impressed at the end of it. <br />

1884737994|5.0|This book does a great job in not only explaining basic bike repairs, but also labeling bike components.  Otherwise, to a newbie, it doesn't do much good to simply state that you must adjust the rear derailler ... but now that you know exactly which piece it is and what it looks like, you are set to performing a basic repair yourself.  This in itself is well worth the price of this book.<br /><br />The first time I flatted, my bike was fortunately in my garage.  So with book in hand, I follwed the instructions on how to get the tire off the rim, remove the tube, check for leaks, search for any debris inside the tire, and patch the tube myself.  And with just a few attempts, managed to get both the tube and tire back on.<br /><br />Since then, I diligently read the other repairs and have put them to good use on the trail.  And no, I don't have the book with me, but the instructions are so good that I can remember how to perform on-the-trail repairs.  This has saved myself and several friends from hoofing it back to the trailhead instead of spending about 5-ish minutes (depending on the repair) to fix it ourselves.<br /><br />I keep a repair kit stocked and with me at all times thanks to this book.  As a female rider who is not typically mechnically inclined, I am able to follow the instructions and spend more time on the trail and less time at the mechanic.
B00009V7P8|2.0|I received \\"O\\" for my birthday.  I didn't know what to expect, but my friend and I usually share our musical taste and I was looking forward to listening to something new. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have described Damien Rice's songs as achingly beautiful, haunting, and powerful. I completely agree that these adjectives all apply - but only to the music itself.  What I do not and never will agree with is that his voice shares these qualities.  With few exceptions, Rice accompanies the rich and wonderful instrumentation in his songs with a voice that sounds like a garbage truck running over a detuned banjo.  After listening to this cd, I want to cry, but not because it brought me to some emotional epiphany; rather, I am distraught that something so beautiful could have been ruined for me by a voice that warbles from the low whisper of a drag queen with emphysema to the high pitched moo of a cow being lead to the slaughter. <br /> <br />As someone who loves the music of David Gray, Norah Jones, and Dave Matthews, I'm used to a certain level of talent in what I listen to.  Damien Rice falls short of this level like a retard in graduate school.  To anyone who can look past his voice and only hear the sweetness of his music, I applaud you.  As for me, I can only wish that he somehow, someday learns how to sing.

B0007P3582|5.0|awesome cd with great production. has tracks produced by scott storch, eminem, dr.dre, and a bunch of other producers. has a great variety of different songs. on this album, fifty  shows he's more than just a gangsta, and that he really has talent. awesome cd. go out and buy it.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I think that the title sums up this POS pretty well. Let's face it. This guy has the IQ of a retarded sea cucumber. He can't even enunciate words like \\"rental\\". he raps about the same things over and over and over again, he's utternly tone deaf, and worst of all,. he actually thinks he's cool. Stay away from this excremental and pathetic work of stupidity. Please.
B00006JJ51|5.0|go to mike \\"michael\\"s review. this kid is stupid. i guarantee his review will make you laugh.
B00005RRG9|4.0|The best film, and unlike \\"That Darn Cat,\\" this movie took on two remakes which were actually pretty good. There was \\"Parent Trap II\\" which still shows up on late late late night movie spots on TV, and the better known \\"Parent Trap\\" starring Dennis Quaid and Lindsay Lohan.    Of course, being a Hayley Mills fan, as well as a fan of 60s and 70s Disney style, I must rate this (the original) A+ and the best of them all. Hayley pulls off the the twin stunt without a hitch. I always wondered if they got the idea for this from The Patty Duke Show (now THERE'S a show that needs to see a DVD release!)    Have a multi region or Region 2 DVD and want to pay about the same and get Italian and German dubs bundled with what you'd get here? (menu selectable for Eng, Ita and De audio) search amazon.de DVDs for \\"Die Vermhlung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt.\\"     DVDs have a catch, you need a Region Free or Region 2 player for that, since Hollywood wants to control your TV. (It's an intentional lockout placed by the industry called \\"Region Codes\\", not an incompatibility) They always short-change people in DVD's \\"Region 1\\" (which are sold in the US and Canada) out of a wonderful opportunity to hear the same movie in European languages.  (And to think of the hundreds of dollars Americans spend on tape sets to hear dialog by native speakers in another language.)

6303921248|5.0|If you are like me and HATE seeing your favourite books get massacred onscreen, then you will, hopefully, find this adaptation flawless. Amazing acting and attention to detail are the driving force behind this production.
0804115613|4.0|I wanted to take a moment to give some credit to a few books I'd highly recommend, and this is one of them. This narrative tale about life, family and connections in an older, southern town is packed full of enough flavor to be both compelling and convincing.  <br /> <br />We're given a view into two very different lives, that of a woman in the 1980's enduring midlife in a kind of defeated desperation, and the deeper look into the life of a family that endured, twisted and turned through some very unexpected bends. Make no mistake, the author isn't waxing poetic about the golden years... you get an almost raw look into the bittersweet stories and truths that only family members know. It'll pull you in and immediately give you a sense of connection to our poor middle-aged southern wife who becomes equally compelled. <br /> <br />One of the greatest pieces of praise I have for the book is its kindly closure for the family from these beloved tales... we see how some of them completed their lives, and how others were trying to adjust to the changing times. It's touching. My only wish that wasn't granted was that they didn't move too far into the future of Evelyn, our modern wife. The movie spends more time with her than the book does, but it's still such a tasty end. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
0312319517|5.0|There are very few top-shelf revenge books.  Certainly, A.J. Quinnell's Creasy series qualifies.  Forsythe adds to the collection with _Avenger_, the story of Calvin Dexter.  The protagonist is an attorney and triathlete who happens to be a Vietnam Vet.  He served with distinction as a \\"tunnel rat\\" and mastered the art of trapping the Vietcong in their own claustrophobic environs. <br /> <br />After returning to the states, he experiences a personal and painful family tragedy.  From that point forward, Dexter devotes himself to bringing certain parties to justice.  Parties that others fear or are protected by foreign governments. <br /> <br />One such party is Zoran Zilic, a monstrous war criminal who participated in some of the most gruesome war-crimes imaginable as Yugoslavia disintegrated.  Zoran made the fundamental mistake of killing a volunteer aid-worker whose grandfather was a self-made Canadian billionaire.  The grandfather, a World War II veteran, contracts Dexter to track down Zilic and exact certain revenge. <br /> <br />Two issues cloud Dexter's mission.  First off, Zilic has fled Yugoslavia, having seen the writing on the wall.  Secondly, U.S. counter-terror groups have been positioning Zilic to run missions for them in order to combat the rise of Al Qaeda.  Zilic, one of the few persons trusted by the terrorist hierarchy, is the perfect pawn for the U.S.  And they have no desire to have their operation destroyed by a mercenary vigilante like Dexter. <br /> <br />In intricately plotted detail, Forsythe describes how Zilic is tracked down and how Dexter intends to accomplish his mission, come what may.  Forsythe is still at the top of his game and \\"Avenger\\" -- trite name not withstanding -- is an outstanding read.

While the album may not go down as a hip hop classic, some tracks on it will stand the test of time.
B000068CNX|5.0|\\"Friends\\" became a bigger hit than anybody had expected it to be. After the first season, ratings were sky high. Jennifer Aniston (RACHEL GREEN), Courteney Cox Arquette (MONICA GELLAR), Lisa Kudrow (PHOEBE BUFFAY), Matt LeBlanc (JOEY TRIBBIANI), Matthew Perry (CHANDLER BING), & David Schwimmer (ROSS GELLAR) return in their hilarious second season.    Our six best friends are back in their second season. Picking up where the final episode of the first season had left off, Rachel anxiously waits at the airport for Ross, who is flying back to the states from China. Rachel is so anxious to tell him that she knows about his love for her and that she feels the same way, hoping she and Ross could start dating. But Rachel is heartbroken when she finds Ross stepping off of the plane with another woman named Julie.     For the first few episodes, Ross continues to date Julie, while Rachel angrily bickers over it. We also learn that Phoebe is secretly married to a gay Canadian ice dancer named Duncan. He only married Phoebe for his greencard. Phoebe spends time with Duncan after a night of performing. He tells Phoebe that he needs a divorce because he met someone else...a woman. Turns out that Duncan was not gay. The woman he is seeing is about to become his future wife. Also, Monica and Rachel's annoying neighbor, Mr. Heckles, who lives one floor below them, passes on. Mr. Heckles was a lonely hermit. Chandler learns that when Heckles was young, he dismissed woman that had features that just didn't sit right with him. Chandler realizes that he does the exact same thing. He calls Janice, wanting to get back together with her, wanting to make a commitment, but Janice couldn't wait around for Chandler. Janice had gotten married to the boss of Mattress King. The two have a kid on the way.     Rachel learns that her ex-fianc, Barry, is engaged to her best friend, Mindy, who was supposed to stand as Rachel's maid of honor. Ross suddenly finds out about Rachel's feelings for him. He breaks up with Julie and hopes to date Rachel, but Chandler and Joey talk him into making up a list of pros and cons between the girls. Rachel becomes angry and then dismisses the idea of dating Ross. But she changes her mind when she and Monica watch the home video of their Senior Prom. Rachel's date practically never showed up, forcing Ross to vow to take Rachel. But when Ross comes downstairs, finally dressed. Rachel's date shows up, leaving Ross heartbroken. Feeling terrible about knowing this, Rachel decides to give the romance a chance with Ross.     Monica, with Phoebe's help, caters for a party, held by Dr. Richard Burke. Richard is an ophthalmologist, who is best friends with Monica and Ross' dad. But Richard and Monica find love in each other's eyes and the two begin a healthy relationship, despite the 25-year age difference. Joey is offered a small role on one episode of Days Of Our Lives as a cab driver, but the producers changed their minds and gave Joey the permanent role of Dr. Drake Ramoray on the same show. But Joey was killed off early, when he revealed that he changes his lines. Rachel finds out that her mother and father are getting a divorce. Sandra Green, Rachel's mother, only tells Rachel because she hoped Rachel would understand. Rachel asks her why, of all people, would she understand. Sandra reveals that, \\"...You didn't marry your Barry, dear. But I married mine.\\" At the same time, Ross finds out that Carol and Susan want to get married. Ross is less enthused about it, but he comes to Carol's rescue when her parents decide not to show up and give her away. Ross stands in and gives Carol away.     Barry and Mindy's wedding has arrived. Mindy has requested that Rachel be her maid of honor. Rachel has no intentions of showing up, but decides to do so in order to redeem herself in front of Barry's family. Ross goes along with Rachel to the wedding, with the company of Monica and Richard. Monica talks to Richard about a future. Richard agreeswith Monica until Monica brings up one little thing: children. Monica really wants children, but Richard already has two children: Timothy Burke and Michelle Burke. Richard is not up to doing it all again, forcing Monica to make the painful decision she does not want to make. They sadly break up. At that time, Chandler has an all-night online conversation with a woman, who he seems to really like. He discovers that she is married, which leaves him devastated, but his hopes are brought back up when she tells him that she's getting a divorce. They set up a meeting at the coffeehouse. Chandler's mystery internet girl is...Janice. Chandler discards Janice's annoying characteristics and develops a long-term relationship with her.     More fun is to be seen in the second season.

B0004Z33EG|4.0|This film seen under the serene gaze of more than twenty years is the expected reaction of so many frustrations, disillusions born under the bad sign of Vietnam. In those ages  the state of abandon and apathy in all the country had almost a quarter of century. From the Kennedy affair till the last eighties a chain of successive scandals,  politic corruption and internal affairs of any issue literally invaded every inch of ink of the principal headlines of the written press and other mediums.<br /><br />In this state of things, the depressed spirit was analyzed by the merchandisers and Rocky was the first punch to raise the self stem of the mass media. Songs as Born in the USA, for instance, made the same role. Then Rambo was born as a mythological figure. A hero born precisely from the ashes who lived the hell and become  a machine human war. And the rest is story. The film obviously sympathizes with John Rambo as the peaceful man who simply wants to forget his job and remake a new life, but the ancestral codes and the old fashioned mind of the law bureaucracy will raise the hidden demons.<br /><br />Despite the picture has aged, it's a fundamental piece in those turbulent ages and it worked out perfectly as cathartic device. Excellent action sequences.
630522577X|5.0|Just you wait 'Enry 'Iggins and wouldn't it be loverly.  While linguistic experts/deconstructionists criticize the transformation of Eliza, preferring her Cockney dialect to anything in the patriarchal hegemony, we yell, \\"It's just a movie!\\"<br /><br />For goodness' sake, MFL is the forerunner of every reality makeover show out there, with a more worthy more than skin deep message.  \\"The difference between a lady and a flower girl is how she's treated,\\" explains Eliza to Professor Higgins' mother.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is fabulous, Rex Harrison (who Helen Gurley Brown describes as a pill in I'M WILD AGAIN) is suitably stuffy, softening (\\"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\\").  Although Eliza's reciting of vowels into a recorder may seem a little Stepford Wives-ish, Eliza is actually feminist.<br /><br />Interestingly, Eliza's father's pre-wedding song showed up in Season 3 of \\"Roswell.\\"
B0007GADZO|1.0|<br /> <br />This is an experimental album. Takin a different road, doing something new, being creative, coming up with something never heard of before...etc. <br /> <br />ok, now that is the obvious, so is it really good? In my opinion, it's terrible! After listening to it, I was not in a hurry to play any of the songs i've just heard. Matter of fact, I still haven't listen to it after the first sit through of this cd. it's really that bad! yes some of the songs takes the same setting from previous songs! LAME! some of the drum beats shouldn't even be considered \\"music.\\" The singing sounds like a a grown 40 yr. dad singing in the shower!  <br /> <br />yes yes steve is among the best in guitar playing, but he puts out crap musically this time. There's nothing in this cd that hooks you into the songs! Just a mash of WEIRD beats and patterns that no one really does in their work!  <br /> <br /> <br />I felt like i really wasted my money. this is NOT rock n roll !!! <br /> <br /> <br />This is yoga music!!!!!!  <br /> <br />damn you steve!
0783225792|5.0|This may well be the last film with these two great actors in a mob story film. The title and also PR for the film back at it's release were a bit confussing. I remember thinking in 1997, It's a story about rich casino owners and the problems that go with it...So where is the story? I was so wrong. This film is pure mob. NOT casino tales and rich people. It is more mob than Goodfellas, Which I did not think was possible. Joe Pesci really shines in this one. Even more reckless, Crazy and violent than any others that he played. It is the story of a jewish man (DeNiro) That is loved by the mob for his gift of picking  winners of sports games. They wanted to move out to Las Vegas to set up shop out west and make some money and run the scams. So DeNiro was picked to be the head of a new casino there even without a casino license. Since he was not Italian, Someone from the family had to go with and protect him...In comes Pesci. <br />Joe Pesci's (Nicky) Is a wise guy with a violent, cold nature that was sent to protect DeNiro but to also rip off the casino he was sent to protect. DeNiro's (Sam Rothenstien) Does not even realize this is the true reason. He takes his ownership of the casino very seriously, and wants everything to be on the level. To make things even worse, DeNiro falls for a drug user/hustler in town played by Sharon Stone. She is not in love with him and tells him so, But he still wants a wife and family before he grows too old. However he does not see how much trouble she will be in the future. Nicky (played by Pesci) Starts to get very greedy and starts to run his own scams in Vegas behind the \\"Goodfellas\\" backs. In the end, Nicky has to face the end result, It is hard to watch! Those that have seen it know what I mean, Baseball without a ball! I just hope DeNiro and Pesci team up with Scorsese one more time in the future. But if this is the last one it is a great film to go out on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002MP2|4.0|so, yeah.....this is a punk album...a few people tried to say that green day wasnt punk, and somebody on here said that punk was all about hating hippies. where the hell did you get that from? punk no longer means rough bullying redneck trailer trash, and hasnt for quite some time, but I suppose that redneck trailer trash would hate hippies. yeah, so if you still think that, your trailer trash or a poser...take your pick....theirs to many bloody posers nowadays to, thinking green day isnt punk, ha, green day, after nirvana, practically started punk, so what the hell? this is punk rock....
B000003TAW|5.0|Usually, bands don't reach their peaks with their first album, but Weezer did just that, and really hasn't been as great since.  <br /> <br />Rivers Cuomo is a musical genius, but never gets the respect deserved because of his image as the stereotypical college rock musician. He is so much more than this, and this album, along with its diversity, reflects this. He sings about broken homes (Say it ain't so, the best song on the CD), 50's nostalgia (Buddy Holly), and alcoholism cleverly disguised with a surfing metaphor (Surf Wax USA).
B0001RVTXO|5.0|First I must confess that I am writing from the perspective of being an obsessive Pixies freak.  The Pixies to me are one of the most important bands ever to have graced the planet of sound.  Their cutting edge music, 99% of which was written by Black Francis (aka Frank Black), has directly influenced the music of heavyweights such as Radiohead, Nirvana and David Bowie.  To me they are so important that I felt compelled to jet back to Britain from Beijing in June 2004 just to catch one of their comeback gigs at Brixton Academy... It was well worth the money and the jetlag! <br /> <br />So, I guess I should be happy with any new Pixies release (as most obsessed music fans find it difficult to criticize the bands they hold in such high esteem)?  Not so I'm afraid. <br /> <br />Whilst there is not a weak song on this album, it seems like a pointless waste of time to recommend this album to people who have never heard the Pixies before.  This album contains songs available on all four of Pixies studio albums, plus the B Sides album released in 2001.   These albums are available at a bargain basement price in most music retail outlets and are no doubt even cheaper on the internet.   <br /> <br />So, why not just start off buying Come on Pilgrim / Surfer Rosa, followed by Doolittle, then Bossanova, then Trompe Le Monde, and finally the B Sides album.  These 5 albums wouldn't be very expensive (GBP25, $50) and once you have them you would have all of the songs off of this pointless 'Best Of' compilation, plus alot of the better songs that were missed off (Cactus, I've Been Tired, Space (I Believe In) etc.)  Another reason not to buy WOM is that a new Pixies studio album release is due at the end of 2005, which gives you even less reason to purchase this compilation. <br /> <br />In fact if you wanted a decent Pixies 'Best Of' compilation then search online for the live reunion shows that are for sale, as they will contain live versions of all of the above tunes (plus more)and have the added atmosphere of a gig. <br /> <br />It makes you wonder why the record company didn't bother to add some previously unreleased recordings, which would have made this worthy of purchase not just for newbies but also for long time fans.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B00066N8JS|5.0|There are certain CDs I've bought over the years that I found myself wishing I could've bought again and listened to all over again like it was the first time. Thank you, Mr. Reznor, for allowing me to do so with the SACD version of The Downward Spiral.  <br /> <br />If you don't have the surround sound system to listen to the new version in the optimal environment, don't bother buying this. The B-sides & extras aren't really worth the price of admission. They're good and all but it's not like they're new material.  <br /> <br />But listening to the SACD 5.1 mix of TDS was like being 17 again, except this time instead of hearing this music coming from a rinky-dink little stereo, I was being bombarded from all sides by one of the greatest albums of all time. If you're a Nine Inch Nails fans with a good surround sound system, you owe it to yourself to buy this. Even if you're not a fan, this a good test of that expensive sound system you've been wasting on football games and Nora Jones. Imagine having 5 Trent Reznors singing to you from all directions. Imagine hearing every single little mixed together nuanced sound from the original CD coming out of it's own individual speaker.  <br /> <br />People, this is a new way to listen to music that I hope catches on all across the board. The CD has spoiled me. Let it spoil you too.
0060926317|1.0|As an Anglo Australian, I find myself confronted and hugely irritated by this inane book. That Marlo Morgan managed to sell so many thousands upon thousands of copies is beyond me until I remember the 'television audience' mentality that many have in the new age today. It is a pain just thinking about what this story entails - fiction touted as fact - and damaging to many aboriginal people as well as it portrayed them and their culture as something they are not.  <br /> <br />To be sure, it is also a laughable matter, reading this book. It's kind of like mixing an image of a television soap with a science fiction fantasy. <br /> <br />My biggest concern is the fact that our (Australia's) beloved aboriginal elder, Burnham Burnham become involved in the story, touring with Marlo Morgan. I feel his spirit was broken from his association with this fiction and, indeed, he passed away in a cloud that shouldn't have been around him. <br /> <br />Sad... and it's still rating well on Amazon. Pity.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD is my absolute favorite CD right now, I love just about everything.  Standout tracks: Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and Whatsername.
B000021Y7X|5.0|That's right folks, this performance is that good. Once you see all that a concert performance CAN be, in the hands of David Byrne, you will never be able to look at concerts the same again. Talking Heads frontman Byrne leads his band in a performance that blurs the lines between musical cinema and live concert. To begin, Byrne sought out a film director- Johnathan Demme in his pre-Silence of the Lambs days to record the event over three nights in 1984 in LA's Pantages Theater. Byrne had drawn up elaborate plans for a concert with a consatntly changing stage which incorporated various backgrounds, projections, and lighting schemes (you can view his original plans on the Special features menu). <br />  The concert begins with the sound of a cheering audience and legs walking. David Byrne emerges with acoustic guitar and sets down a boombox playing an R&B beat. He then proceeds with an acoustic solo version of \\"Psycho Killer\\" alone on stage against a blank background. Bassist Tina Weymouth joins him for the next track, \\"Heaven\\", and her husband and drummer Chris Frantz comes out for the third track, \\"Thank You For Sending Me An Angel\\". The final member of the band, Jerry Harrison, joins in on rhythm guitar for the fourth song, \\"Found A Job\\". On the fifth track, \\"Slippery People\\", the backup singers and guest percussionist Steve Scales join in. Keyboardist Bernie Worrell and guitarist Alex Weir come in later on, and complete the backing band. Harrison moves between guitar and secondary keyboard throughout the concert, and Weymouth alternates between bass and bass synth. On \\"Naive Melody\\" this creates a triple-keyboard attack that is awesome. Byrne is the centerpiece of the show, spasming and gyrating like a man possessed, even jogging around the entire stage at one point. The rest of the band feeds off his energy and the entire performance is just insanely energentic and powerful. After the classic \\"Once In A Lifetime\\", Byrne leaves the stage for the performance of \\"Genius of Love\\" by the Tom Tom Club, the side project of Frantz and Weymouth. He emerges afterwards, donning his trademark Big Suit for \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\".  <br />   Plain and simple, this is the vision of a visionary (not to overlook the great performances by the rest of the band), and its hard to fault such a daring and brilliant work, though some of the song choices are questionable. Be sure to stick around afterward for Byrne's self-interview (\\"It's like 60 minutes on acid!\\") I can't say whether or not this is a good introduction to Talking Heads, but if you want one I recommend the newly-released greatest hits compilation \\"Sand In The Vaseline\\".
B00025ETIW|5.0|Great metal guitar solos, punk style songs, nice rythems, and a dash of \\"emo\\" helped My Chemical Romance sell out this album.  First off, I would like to say that this is one of most well originated albums of all time.  Just look at the names of their songs.  \\"Thank you for the venom\\"  \\"Its not a statement, Its a deathwish\\"  \\"I never told you what i did for a living\\".  I mean, these are great names for songs, with great style, rythem, and punk to go along with it. <br /> <br />This album gives you 13 quality tracks that can blow you're mind away!  <br />Let me first start with \\"I'm Not Okay (I promise)\\"  You may have seen this video on MTV, or on the internet, but for those of you who have'nt, this is their best song on the album.  The beggining guitar sequence is a nice way to introduce the plot, and the lyrics blow me away.  This was \\"My Chemical Romance's\\" first single, and I don't think it will be their last. <br /> <br />Helena:  This song was probably my favorite out of the 13 tracks on this album.  The chorus is really catchy.  At first, this song might seem weird, but I promise that you'll enjoy it after a while.  Back to the chorus.  Here are the lyrics: <br /> <br />\\"What's the worst thing I could say <br />Things are better if I stay! <br />So long and good night <br />So long and good night!\\" <br /> <br />They might not seem to snazzy on paper, but they are really catchy when listening to them.  I enjoy the plot line as well.  This song really showed the emotional side of My Chemical Romance, and I hope that they can make more songs like this in the future. <br /> <br />Thank You For The Venom:  Wow!  At first I was stunned.  I thought that this was one of those kind of songs you just do to add to you're album, but I was wrong.  The chorus is amazing, and the rythem drum fillers are awesume.  The versus' are short and fast.  Great lyrics, and great rythem make this song killer. <br /> <br />It's Not A Fasion Statement, Its a dishwish:  This song starts out with a pretty good guitar filler.  The drums are consistant, with some nice fills.  I found this song very entertaining, and I bet that you'll be humming the chorus beat after listening to this after a while. <br /> <br />I didn't review all of the tracks, but I did review my favorite four.  I really don't know how you can call this band pathetic emo/punk/pop, because they arn't.  They are a great band in the making, and it will take a few years for them to be on top of their game.  I really think that this album was their start to fame.
0887431453|3.0|My son was almost 4 when we got this a couple of months ago, and he really likes it (still does), but it's a bit frustrating in the following way: many of the pictures that it uses for learning letters (e.g. \\"circle the picture that begins with u\\") are of vocabulary items that 4 year olds don't necessarily know.  E.g. for \\"u\\" they had a batter and someone who I guessed was an umpire.  But my 4-year-old doesn't know what an umpire is, even though he's cognitively just at the right level for this book in the sense that he finds it fun to do, and when he knows what the pictures are he can pick the right one.  Another page had a frilly heart as one of the choices for \\"v\\", and you were supposed to know that the heart was a valentine.  My kid has a pretty big vocabulary for a 4-year-old, and knows the word valentine, but it just was a little abstract for him.  The result is that I have to help him a lot, and I think it'd be more fun for him if he felt he could do it himself.  If anyone knows of a similar book with more age-appropriate vocabulary pictures, it'd be great if they could post that in a review, since he does really seem to enjoy the activities in the book, and views getting to do the book as a treat.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Nietzschenian analysis of Dr. Strangelove.  <br /> <br />What a strange world the movie Dr. Strangelove presents us! How is it possible that a democratic society can be so constructed that the crazy idea of one person could within an hour destroy the whole of humanity! Democracy is suppose to give citizens of a commonwealth the power to decide the actions of their government, but clearly the people could not have given consent to the action of General Turgidsen who wanted to kill them all. Sure, General Turgidsen only had the power to call for nuclear attack because the President had given commanding officers this prerogative power, and the President was elected by the people. Nevertheless, did the people know all the secret prerogatives that the President signs?! <br />   <br />    This shows the struggle between democracy and aristocracy. As Nietzsche elucidates in The Genealogy, the history of our world is a struggle between the Honorable Romans and the lowly Judea people, and the modern idea of democracy is clearly an extension of the Judaic ideal which to some degree claims \\"the wretched alone are the good; the poor, impotent, lowly alone are the good.\\" (34) But as shone in Dr. Strangelove, the modern democratic state is only democratic in name. The people, despite their power to elect, clearly have no power in the actual operations of the government and do not even know all the classified regulations and executive orders which govern them.  <br /> <br />      One must ask, America became America because of the idealism of a group of young revolutionaries who thought they were suppressed by the noble people of England! How could this have turned into a Romanic government? This is because although the Judaic mob is a powerful revolutionary force, when the revolution is won, there can be no viable government unless some sort of upper social structure is established for the efficient running of the government. Therefore, as Nietzsche describes to us, there must bea constant struggle between the Roman idea of aristocracy and the Judaic idea of democracy. The corruption of aristocracy naturally leads to democratic movements, yet democracy will need aristocracy to rescue it from chaos.  <br /> <br />      This endless struggle between the two forces was exactly what Nietzsche wanted the world to get out of, so that we could reach \\"die hchste Mchtigkeit und Pracht des Typus Mensch\\" (the highest power and splendor actually possible to the type man, p20)
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I can't believe it, all my friends told me this is a great movie ,so I watched the damn movie - HORRIBLE , what were they thinking? In years I haven't seen such a horrible movie with a tasteless-trying to be sophisticated script! Please! It didn't fooled me,It's just bored me!  The reason this movie became a hit is only because Ashton  Kutcher was in it! If it wasn't him in it, I'm sure those 300 and something reviews weren't so good!
B00000099Y|5.0|One of the most amazing records ever.  I was hooked on this album for a good year straight.  Aenima isn't anything sort of amazing and inspiring.  In fact, most of Maynard's work has the same life-altering effect on me. <br />Here's a band that made it into the mainstream but did not sacrifice any creative licenses on any song.  Tool are as weird, funny, dynamic, and interesting as ever.  Lateralus is a great follow-up to Aenima, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of this with so many excellent tracks like <br />\\"H\\", \\"Eulogy\\", \\"Hooker with a Penis\\", \\"jimmy\\"... and the list goes on and on.  Definitely pick this up.
B0007O38F8|4.0|This a review to all the negative comments as we know it as hatin. The album is Hot, punchlines Hot, Hooks are hot, more than 3/4 of the album could be hit singles. Honestly half these reviews are from kids from the suburbs tryin to be hard, fakin the funk cause they analyze someones hood mentality. 50, is makin his own name not tryin to be like Pac or Big, Jigga, and i bet you another group of people would be hatin on those artist also. 50 is the truth he came in the game gangsta, speaks it and lives it not much you can say bout half the artist out here. Like he said on the mtv, \\"all eyes on 50\\" he just leaving the hood, not the mentality. I guess he should be like eminem and talk bout the same ol story bout his gurl, daughter, and moms. im out people keep hatin
B0007GAEW6|4.0|So I had this thing on repeat since the day it came out. Only within the last couple days has it come off the playlist. <br />This album is interesting. I find that while it definitely rocks, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I can't figure it out. <br />This album is distincly different from De-Loused. De-Loused was more up and down and controlled craziness, this album is smoother and the craziness doesn't seem as controlled, to be so very untechnical. It's almost as if they decided cicatriz ESP was the best song on De-Loused and modelled an entire CD after it and varied the music styles. Which leads me to the next topic, The mucical style. That last album couldn't be described. I just had to make people listen because any description I gave, fell short. This time there are some very distinct sounds going on. I can relate this CD to a mix of Pink Floyd, Carlos Santana, and Led Zeppelin. If that seems crazy, just know that it is. I know this review rattled on all over the place, but I just can't figure out this album. I gave it four stars because I refuse to believe that it would deserve anything less. Good luck, though I doubt this was much help.

B000003TAL|5.0|My favorite and probably a lot of other people's favorite Sonic Youth record.  I first listened to this album about five years ago (the same time I got into Radiohead), and I was really impressed. <br />Now almost 17 years old, this record does not show its age.  It showcases the band's talent.  There will never be another band like Sonic Youth, so don't expect it. <br />The melodies on this album are really interesting and original.  With three vocalists, it's hard to become mundane.  Sonic Youth definitely paved the way for many other indie artists after them.  Thurston and Lee have distinct vocals are amazing guitar players.  Kim adds her own unique sound on bass and her vocals show her influence from groups of the late 1960s. <br />It's under $10, too, so it's a definite steal at that price.
B000025XKM|5.0|The most contradictory and intriguing feature of \\"Pink Moon\\" is the way it's almost so unbarable you can hardly listen to it, and yet so beautiful that you can't find it in yourself to turn your head.  Nick Drake perfectly captured those nights that seem uncapable to go on any longer while it never occures to you to go to sleep.  Every lonesome strum of the guitar and hazy moan of his voice is the feeling of being overpowerred by the dark opposing forces he feels unable to rise against.  His lyrics constantly refer to the moon and the stars and dark nights. To those who have felt these same feelings, gazing into the large powerfull night know that Nick Drake isn't faking it, it's just too honest a feeling; too melancolly and too real.  While the album might not seem dark or drenched in despair on first listen, underlying the surface there's so much of it that when it hits, you feel the effects and it leaves it's mark on your spirit.  Since his death in the early 70s, people have often portrayed his career as \\"cut short\\" or ending to early, as if Nick Drake had so much more that he intended to show us and by accident was unable to.  In fact, Nick Drake said that he simply had nothing more to record.  And with 3 perfect albums defining himself as an artist whose soul and bare emotion is beyond imitation, why would he?  There's a beginning, a middle, and \\"Pink Moon\\" as the ending to the story of Nick Drake, the legendary folk artist who wrote utterly beautifull music that simply could not be played in a standard way, the emotions didn't match it.  Nick Drake tuned his guitar in the only ways he found fit to portray the mood of the album, and captured this feeling perfectly in a 30 minute frame.  I can't explain why one more song might have ruined it or why another minute would not have matched what he was trying to put forth, only he knew, and when an artist knows when to stop and knows what's enough, I can safely call him wise and pull out the phrase \\"less is more\\". And yet the album never feels too short or lacking instrumentation or losing anything by being stripped down bare, it just feels complete, and that's all that matters.  Nick Drake never really made it although he supposedly always wanted too, and some have even suggested that it made him depressed as if fame and fortune might have produced a different ending rather than a  mental institution and a suicide; this album suggests otherwise.  Nick Drake didn't seem to want fame enough to compromise his origionality and he never gave in to making anything other than what was obviously from his soul, you can tell.  So, as Drake sings of gazing into the stars and seems so completely not in control of his feelings, it's difficult to say that Nick Drake simply felt like a failure, there's just so much more behind it and the feelings are just so much deeper, so beyond it.  \\"Pink Moon\\" is a magical and timeleless epilogue, not a failed musician being cut off in mid-sentence.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This film is absolutely amazing, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are  genius.    The film is about a secret goverment team, who deal with world terrorism and deal with any threat with absolutely no bloody clue, but try to look cool, because their american, shoot first then shoot again and again we don't need to ask any questions.       This film is very clever with the politics involved which is tricky because of the content.  Constant fear of terrorism today is very serious, but Trey and Matt have made light of this state of mind, in a good way.      The songs within this film are also brilliant from the theme song America, F--k Yeah, to other such tunes as Pearl Harbor Sucked and I'm so wonley (lonely)      As you would expect from a Parker/Stone film there is loads of bad languge, however I would recommend this film to anyone over 15 years old.    Parker/Stone we kneel before you.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I had nearly lost the belief that new experimental music could successfully exist in this present world of American Idol drivel.  That is until a friend of mine turned me onto \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium.\\"  I just freaked out. And to boot, Ikey plays a Mellotron (an antique and rare keyboard instrument that I proudly own).  I purchased \\"Frances the Mute\\" expecting a sophomore slump and was I ever wrong.  The final five minutes of this CD is some of the most incredible music I have ever experienced in my 46 years of existence.  Thank you The Mars Volta for restoring my faith.
B000002LK1|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time. It is not only DM's best but the best of all synth/new wave. This album has such power and emotion behind it. The feeling u have when u listen to it is unexplainable. If everyone on the planet owned a copy of Violator silly as it sounds.. I think the world would be a much calmer place. and if there was such a thing as perfection.. this would be it. I wore the cd out back in 1990 when I lived in Germany where Depeche Mode are gods and I continue to do so. My favorite songs are Halo, World in My Eyes, Policy of Truth.. ok ok so I can't name just one.. LOL the whole thing is a masterpiece!
B00006LLNU|5.0|My favorite Sigur Ros album without question.  It's the first one that I listened to all the way through, and that might be why.  I think it flows much better than their other albums.  Haunting and beautiful vocals and ambient music throughout create a very winter-esque sound. <br />\\"Untitled #2\\" and \\"Untitled #3\\" are truly brilliant.  I have them on my permanent playlist. <br />Although this album is very depressing, it definitely does not take away from the emotion you will experience when listening to it.  I recommend listening to it alone in a dark room for the first time.  It will inspire you.
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you like Linkin Park you'll love this CD. If you've never heard them this is the band's peak performance. Hard-hittin (with right system), and good lyrics. If I could i would give this a 12, but then again I am a big fan. So pick it up listen to it; if you like rock, and if you like rap (with a little bit of yellin)you'll love it garenteed. <br /> <br />Also what ever ppl is sayin about 50 cent and how The Massacre sucks are insane. The CD is off the chain. So pick that up too.
B000002KCC|4.0|If Neil Young won't release 'Time Fades Away' because of its dark, underproduced (if not misproduced), ragged quality, then 'Tonight's the Night' must have barely made the cut.  But it surely sounds exactly as Young intended it to, so it's not \\"misproduced\\".  If there is such a thing as being beautifully unpolished, this is it.  It's just wrong enough to be just right. <br /> <br />Neil's voice is crushed and ravaged on this album, but so was the man by 1975.  A series of calamities including a divorce, the birth of a disabled child, the beginning of a long-term fallout with David Crosby, Graham Nash and Stephen Stills, and especially the tragic loss of Crazy Horse second guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry to hard drugs fueled this barely-still-standing production.  On songs such as 'Mellow My Mind', you would swear Neil is doing all he can to sound bad, his voice quivering, cracking and breaking in all the wrong places.  Perhaps Neil was singing like Bruce Berry, who the title track tells us would \\"sing a song in a shakey voice that was real as the day was long\\".  Neil has even embraced \\"Shakey\\" as his own alias, alluding first to his bouts with epilepsy, but secondarily to his own trademark vocal style.  There are numerous versions of the title track to be had, but on this CD we have the definitive versions, nearly ten minutes in total, with 'Part II' being a rock heavy, guitar driven version that is every bit worthy of its reprise here on Reprise Records. <br /> <br />The album as a whole kicks it in a big, slow way.  'Albuquerque', with a sound reminiscient of the big sounds of 'Big Time' (from Neil's 1996 'Broken Arrow' CD) is exhibit 'A', and 'Lookout Joe' is exhibit 'B', with a slicing and dicing slide guitar solo compliments of long-time Young collaborator Ben Keith.  The album rocks through other numbers such as 'World On a String', a live 'Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown' (one of the weaker tunes, but included here as a nod to Whitten, who helped write and adds vocals on the track), and 'Roll Another Number'.  'Speakin' Out' features a honky-tonk piano along with an inspired guitar solo by journeyman Nils Lofgren, who is featured on eight tracks. <br /> <br />There are also some rather beautiful, soft acoustic moments, in particular 'Borrowed Tune' and 'New Mama'.  The latter track features a sweet wooden guitar riff which harkens back to CSN's 'Find the Cost of Freedom'.  The song is an interesting contrast to the electric cover version offered by Stephen Stills on his 'Still' album, released in the same year as this disc. <br /> <br />The album is dedicated to Whitten and Berry, whose \\"life was in his hand\\" (not \\"hands\\"... you shoot up one-handed).  The booklet includes photographs, one of which shows Crazy Horse with Lofgren on stage, their names printed under them.  Off to the right is an empty area of the stage with Danny Whitten's name underneath.  We also have a newspaper clipping, perhaps the inspiration for the song 'Tonight's the Night', that states \\"For Players and hustlers, tonight's the night\\".  Hopefully all of this melodrama was cathartic for Young.  Certainly for all of us, when Neil works his life out through his music, his losses become our gain.  Thanks for opening it up, Neil.  'Tonight's the Night' is essential for Neil Young fans, and a fine listen for his casual acquaintences.  There are many notable tracks here that you will not find elsewhere.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I love this movie it is one of my favorites. As for the love story part i cant really see much love exept in the extended edition. But still a great  vamp flick
0743454537|4.0|I've been avoiding books by this author because of the way she is marketed -- her book covers remind me of Anita Shreve, whom I do not like.  HOWEVER -- this was a fascinating book, intellectual and emotional at the same time.  There are days when I want a dense literary read, and days when I'm not energetic enough for the task.  In the latter case, Jodi Picoult is a wonderful compromise -- there's enough meat to keep my brain engaged, but the prose is very accessible. <br /> <br />The premise of this novel raises some interesting ethical dilemmas for current society.  I liked the way the various characters were represented, and I particularly enjoyed the sympathetic portrayal of Anna and Jesse, left to raise themselves because of the complexity of Kate's illness.   <br /> <br />Two last points: <br />a) I thought that Sata's portrayal was perfect -- she's the ultimate codependent parent and very believable considering the family situation.  I've known several families dealing with illness/addiction, and Sara's action's ring very true. <br /> <br />b) Unlike some other reviewers, I got the ending (even if it shocked me.) Life is sad and random.  It would be lovely if everything wraps up fairly and neatly, but it doesn't.  The ending reflects this.
1582403589|5.0|Wow!  blew my mind!  Greatest Zombie novel ever.  Lack of color actually helped in my mind.
0767817486|1.0|Midnight Express has quite a reputation for being a harrowing experience but I find the film quite contrived and lightweight.  If you want to check out some disturbing prison flicks I recommend Scum and Scrubbers.  The film starts of well and tense but then loses all pace and feels as real as a TVM.  Billy Hayes was a drug smuggler simple as that.  I'm sure his time in prison was quite uneventful as the tongue biting scene was totally out of character but one of the rare highlights in this throughly dull movie.  We got his long drawn out build up to the escape and when it happened everything was over in 10 minutes. I also did not see any caucasian Turkish prison guards with 5 days growth and long straggy hair but he managed to fool the twenty guards he walked past. I think the director had reached breaking point as well. Talk about a cheap ending various photographs of family members meeting him at the airport they must have run out of money.  Lowlight of the film the slushy scene in the shower with the hair bear bunch.  Highlight Irene Miracle's knockers.  The reason this whining garbage gets one star.
0670033375|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars because I found the topic interesting but like others agree that Mr. Diamond is in need of a good editor.  He lays out his framework of five factors that lead to collapse:  environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, decreased support by friendly neighbors, and societal response to its problems.  The remainder of the book cites examples of societies that have failed and relates them to the five factors.  Unfortunately, a great deal of the text is also descriptions of the methods by which modern historians have reached their conclusions.  I found myself quickly skimming over much of the material to get to the \\"meat\\" (at least for me) of the story of each civilization.  What started as an interesting topic became a slog.  The meat never really came as all of the societies studied were small and isolated.  I was hoping, as were many others, to hear Mr. Diamond's assessment of Rome, China, etc.  Instead I got Montana and Easter Island.
B0000026NC|5.0|In writing this review, I have focused purely on the music rather than the band composition and have not compared this to other albums. I think any album or compilation has to be taken in isolation and in this, DST stands out as an extremely well composed and engineered album. What I like about this album is its brooding and almost smoky feel, particularly when you listen to it on cloudy, rainy days, when you are just a bit blue and when you dont want something heavy going on in the background. Pick this album, put it in your CD changer and let it loop, and watch the music grow on you. The soothing bass and the mellow guitating gets you going. Get your rare scotch out and pour yourself a couple and let the heady combination take you to stratosphere!! <br /> <br />
B0000035E7|2.0|Out of all the nirvana albums this one is the most interesting. Unfortunately it is definately no the best one. I am a great fan of nirvana songs but i must say i hate a ton of them. A lot of this heavy crap only helped to fuel the end of rock. On this album the only songs worth listening to are lovebuzz and about a girl. A much better CD is the unplugged one. it has a better acoustic sound that shows the talent nirvana truly had
B0000AI45P|5.0|Before I had heard this album, I hated punk. All forms of it. This album eased me into punk with its simple and poignant, yet amazing and catchy guitar riffs that sound as original and fresh today as they ever could have. <br />Every single song on this album is a gem, a unique and beautiful gem. <br />Marquee Moon is probably the best track. Running over ten minutes, it's an energetic instrumental masterpiece. <br />See No Evil is just as great, if not greater. A true \\"punk\\" song. It's fast and catchy and to the point. <br /> <br />The remastered version also includes Little Johnny Jewel, which is a great addition to this already-perfect album. <br /> <br />Listen, do yourself a favor and buy this album now!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Do u know the kind of Groups that move the genre, that aren't afraid or ashaimed of experimenting with Music? The kind that have their unique Style, The kind That Make Music...  <br /> <br />This is NOT slipknot and definetely NOT Iowa! This is the ALBUM, that shows the REAL, CONFIDENT SLIPKNOT... THE SLIPKNOT... First time I heard it - I was a bit shocked. I couldn't even listen it until the end - I was DISSAPOINTED. <br /> <br />Just after times and times of tries I gave to this album, I saw the beaty of Vermillion Pt.2, then I recognized the Confidence of Vermillion, then I felt the Atmosphere of Circle, then came Hollywoody Prelude, Crazy Nameless, then... <br /> <br />Then I just realised, that Slipknot is not just about Shouting and Growling (and Cory does that better than anyone!). THE SLIPKNOT is about CONFIDENCE... Confidence in every word they sing, in every jesture they show with their songs... <br /> <br />Now shortly about the Songs: <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0 (8/10) - Great opening, very cinematic (as it was reviewed earlier). Though u get bored with this song very quickly :( Nevertheless, it's unquestionnably worth listening to it once. <br /> <br />The Blister Exists (9/10) - Probably old Slipknot :) sounds very catchy and Massive on concerts, the song made for the Show, not for the listening alone at home... <br /> <br />Three Nil (10/10) - Very individual song - people mostly like or hate it :) Boring beginning and catchy Verse of \\"Goodbyes\\" make it one of the faces of THE ALBUM. <br /> <br />Duality (8,5/10) - First slow song on the Album, beautiful words and phrases (without the big meaning though :) put together with a bit mainstreamy music create... a SINGLE :) first time u hear it, you won't recognise the Group for sure... <br /> <br />Opium Of The People (6/10) - Strange fill-song, nothing interesting. Just gives your brain a break between probably the most lyrical and meaningful Songs of the Group ever. <br /> <br />Circle (10/10) - Very Atmospheric song (one of only two REALLY SLOW SONGS of Slipknot). Good Lyrics, catchy music (and strings of mainstream make it only more beutiful) and... ATMOSPHERE... (Very cool samples do their job perfectly) <br /> <br />Welcome (7/10) - Old Slipknot + Slower Ruthm - Lyrics :) = Fill-Song... <br /> <br />Vermillion (10/10) - Now that's THE SONG. The Second Face of the Album after Three Nil. First 2 Verses are slow and nothing special. But then u'll hear such CONFIDENT VOICE (and I mean really CONFIDENT, especially if u have good Dynamics with a good BASS!) and probably the longest Growl of the Album in the near end of the Song. It's The Perfect Song about how can real man sometimes get weak... <br /> <br />Pulse of The Maggots (9/10) - Like The Blister Exists, a perfect song for the Show. Cinematic effect of the song, long beginning and, what makes Slipknot THE SLIPKNOT on concerts - THE RUSH of Music they make... Not for home listening... <br /> <br />Before I Forget (8/10) - Strong Lyrics make it a good song... But... it's NOT CATCHY. It just doesn't have the SOUL inside, alike with \\"Opium of The People\\" and \\"Welcome\\" mentioned earlier... <br /> <br />Vermillion Pt.2 (10/10) - The third and final FACE OF THE SLIPKNOT. THE SLOWEST SONG MADE BY THEM EVER! Very beautiful (and, as always, the beaty in Slipknot's songs shows it's face nearly in the end of the song). Strong Words combined with REALLY BEAUTIFUL VOICE of Cory make the Song The Soul of VERMILLION. <br /> <br />Nameless (10/10) - So inventive and FAST riffs and very raw song architecture. Originality and very strong words (the point of this Album) with a mixture of OLD and NEW Slipknot are all here :) Here u go, The whole Slipknot in one song... <br /> <br />The Virus of Life (9/10) - Another Show-Song. They all get 9 out of 10 because the SLIPKNOT really know HOW TO make songs for the crowd! <br /> <br />Danger (6/10) - Fill-the-Album-Song <br /> <br />As u see - 1 Song is Just for The Beginning, 4 Songs Just Fill the Album, 3 Songs are for the Show, 4 Songs are REALLY SONGS and Two remaining ones are actually one Song with it's own BODY (Vermillion) and SOUL (Vermillion Pt.2). <br /> <br />THE ALBUM is pure experiment with Old-Slipknot, Very Strong Lyrics, a bit Mainstream and Beaty... All the Songs are very different but they have a very clear line that unites them all - CONFIDENCE... <br />
B0001611DI|5.0|The remake can't come close to this great Romero classic. This film takes NOTLD to the next level by adding a little more gore [Okay, a lot more], and humor. The film revolves around 4 survivors of the latest zombie feast, who take shelter in an abandoned mall. It is the consumer's fantasy as they kill all the zombies inside and take everything they want from the stores for the next several days. This film is funny, notably the many different zombies [ A nun, a nurse,two little kids, a buddha, an even ones with afros], and there are some witty lines, not to mention very scary and suspenseful. The final scene when the pilot is stuck in the elevator with the blood hungry zombies surronding him is a part to watch. Romero let's you know not to take this film seriously, and the gore is excellent if you can stomach it, I mean, way better than the remake. Don't waste your time with today's crap and just go out and rent this.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Visually stunning, a work that took many years to get the funding and script and rights to, the fact that it exists is a testament to the sheer force of Salma Hayek's will, drive and determination. The performances here are all good, bringing the characters to life vividly. Most vivid of all, however, are the exceptional performances of Hayek as Frida Kahlo and the underrated Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera. Hayek's Frida embodies all the traits that must have made Frida a force of nature... strong, the iron will to live and conquer while still extremely fragile and vulnerable. Frida was a woman of contradictions, as any even cursory look at her body of work will evidence, and Hayek illustrates these contradictions beautifully.  <br /> <br />Interestingly, before this film's theatrical release, I read a review in Playboy magazine, which seriously credited ED NORTON as playing Diego Rivera! Oh yes, despite Edward Norton's versatile gifts as an actor, there is NO WAY he was playing the rotund, Mexican painter. (At the time I was quite appalled that a well-respected, big budget magazine like Playboy could print something so egregiously wrong. Where are the copy editors???) Alfred Molina breathes Diego Rivera, artist at work, loving but voracious husband incapable of fidelity. (Frida never demanded fidelity since it was a standard to which she herself wasn't capable; when Diego's womanizing crossed into family territory-he seduced Frida's sister Cristina-Frida decided enough was enough.)  <br /> <br />The cast is superb (I love Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky), the script (helped along considerably by Edward Norton) excellent, the scenery and cinematography and soundtrack all gorgeous, producing the inevitable effect of tempting the viewer into visiting Mexico City for him or herself. Going to Coyoacan to see Frida's home and works is worth the trip all by itself, but the whole Coyoacan neighborhood is bohemian, artistic and enjoyable, just like this beautiful and moving tribute to a woman and force of nature, Frida Kahlo. <br />
B0000TB050|5.0|I am a huge U2 fan, and have seen plenty of the dvds they have out. This by far is the best one out there. If you have boston, this is better. Heres a song by song review: <br />1.Elevation-Genius! The best oppening of a concert ever! <br />2.Beautiful Day-Awesome second song. Bono sounds awesome and Edge is the best backing vocalist of all time!! <br />3.Until The End Of The World- This is funny because on the second audio option before Edge's solo begins you hear some women scream Bono's name. <br />4.New Years Day-Another classic played very well. I love Edge's woooaah on this one, and the piano part too. <br />5.Out Of Control-This is where the concert goes from Good too great. This is an awesome rendition when Bono tells the story of the band. <br />6.Sunday Bloody Sunday-This song is all about drums for me!!(im a drummer). The drums sound so awesome on this song. Excellent!!! <br />7.Wake Up Dead Man-This song sounds awesome in standard tuning compared to half step down tuning, best performance of this one. <br />8.Stuck In A Moment-All I can say for this is Listen to Edge!! I cant help but laugh! I wonder if he realizes he sounds like a girl? <br />9.Kite-And after this, the concert explodes. Bono sounds great in this song!! It was written for his dad, which makes it even better. <br />10.Angel of Harlem-Another classic performed flawlessly and better than any other time.  <br />11.Desire-WOW!! They really pulled this one out of the box. I love how Larry and Adam join Edge and Bono on the heart. <br />12.Staring at the sun-My only complaint, Stay would have been better, but this is good to. <br />13.All I Want Is You-I really like that Bono deicates the song to his wife. I thought that was cute and followed by an awesome performance of AIWIY. <br />14.Where The Streets Have No Name-Not many people know this but Bono's dad died a week before this, and this song explodes because of it. Bono really lets loose right from the start when he wails during Edge's intro. Drummer's note-This was Larry's best Bridge to the outro. <br />15.Pride-Well done. The Most key changed song. The key has been changed 3 times since The unforgettable fire tour. Very good performance. <br />16.Bullet The Blue Sky-I thought the performance of this song was awesome! U2 at their talented best. <br />17.With or Without You-This song is awesome, and sounds even better live! Excellentlly Performed!! <br />18.One-The only time I have almost cried because of a song. Truly a tearjerker. <br />19.Walk On-Excellent last song choice. They really do this one better live! <br /> <br />So lets review, awesome concert, awesome features, what more could you want. A must have for all U2 fans!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|What is it with everyone sayin all of unearth's songs sound the same I love the new wave stuff and there a lot of bands that really do have songs that are almost exactly the same. Anyhow that whole bullcrap makes me mad whatever. Anyhow the songs \\"The Great Dividers\\",\\"Black Hearts Now Reign\\",\\"Endless\\",and \\"Zombie Autopiolet\\" are the best songs on the ablum
B0002Z9HT8|2.0|I know this has been said by a previous reviewer, but there are 85 songs missing from both the Philadelphia and the England sets. This DVD is most definetely not for those of us who enjoy the harder classic rock, you won't want this. Knowing that Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Santana, and the Who were on this DVD, I was angered at the lack of these bands. Sure, there were two The Who songs, but they were missing My Generation and Pinball Wizard, two of my the Who favorites. Paranoid by Sabbath was there, but my two all time favorite Sabbath tunes (Iron Man and Children of the Grave) were not there! And can you say no Led Zeppelin or Santana? And Judas Priests' Another Thing Coming was missing as well. There were some good things, such as a complete Queen performance, a substantial Judas Priest performance, and a complete Clapton performance. But this is all overshadowed by performances by U2 (BAH!) and Madonna (BAH!). All in all, definetely not something I'd recommend, unless you like horrible music.
0446677450|1.0|i was excited to read this initially...after all, it WAS a best seller...it had to be saying something valuable, right?    a third of the way in the book, i already had a feeling of distrust and everything just seemed very generic and sketchy...    just do a google search on: john reed kiyosaki ...    and learn a bit more about the author...     i didn't bother to finish the rest of it...there are a lot of better ways of securing your financial future.  and a lot of that is plain common sense. and educating yourself on real estate. not via some quick-schemed \\"Amway\\"-type course...
B000002JR8|5.0|Released in 1994 this album is probably Pantera's most relentless album throughout.But also it has the perfect closer at the end with the sabbath cover of \\"Planet Caravan\\". A slow song that lacks heavy guitars and Phil screaming. There is no bad songs on this disc. The best ones are \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\", \\"5 Minutes Alone\\", I'm broken, the brutal \\"Slaughtered\\", and \\"Planet Caravan\\". Listen to \\"Use My Third Arm\\" aswell because it is ulta hard and is a great headbanger!
B00005JLD4|5.0|An affecting, deeply heartfelt film. If you're reading this, you probably guessed that already. <br /> <br />Here's something you might not guess from a quick glance at the DVD cover, though - or closer scrutiny, for that matter: a terrific behind-the-scenes documentary. <br /> <br />Rabbit-Proof Fence has a lot going for it - a richly compelling story, a sensational musical score by Peter Gabriel (in the vein of his Passion music from Last Temptation of Christ), a well-known director with a sure hand and a keen eye for detail, etc., etc. <br /> <br />When all is said and done, though, it all comes down to the kids' performances. One false note there, and the whole movie risks collapse. <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of DVD extras as a rule - I'm of the school that believes the thing should speak for itself.  Also, you and I can pick any number of DVDs that advertised fanta-bulous extras, only to deliver pallid 7-minute \\"documentaries\\" and thinly disguised commercial ads for the movie itself - ie. \\"making-of\\" featurettes that are actually thinly disguised theatrical trailers. <br /> <br />Well, the documentary on this DVD is a stunner - almost reason alone to buy the disc. <br /> <br />The 42-minute documentary - almost half the length of the feature itself -  focuses on Phillip Noyce's casting, vetting and eventual direction of the three kids in question. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have commented here about how striking 11-year-old Evelyn Sampi was in the pivotal role. What's remarkable about the documentary on this DVD is that you get to see exactly what was involved in bringing her out of her shell. It's a candid, affecting, honest portrayal, and Noyce comes across as a deeply humane, empathetic person, about as far removed from the cliche of the Hollywood tyrant as you can get. Sampi, for her part,  is clearly special - though, watching this, it's easy to worry about where she may go from here. <br /> <br />There's a telling moment in the documentary when Noyce, trying to life her spirits at a magazine photo shoot, says, \\"You're going to be like Nicole Kidman\\" (Noyce directed Kidman in her break-through role in Dead Calm, you may recall) and Sampi fires back, without missing a beat: \\"Cathy Freeman.\\" (Cathy Freeman, as you may know, is Australia's world record holder and Olympic champion middle-distance runner, and a hero to her fellow aborigines.) The documentary also gives credit to the kids' acting coach, a trained aborigine actor and acting teacher, and it not only tells you about her but shows her working with the kids. <br /> <br />And let's hear it, too, for Kenneth Branagh, who was brave enough to play a real prick, without once trying to soften the edges. (One minor complaint: This is not Branagh's film; I suspect even he is embarassed to see his face dominate the DVD and movie poster's cover so much. There's a stunning image on the DVD menu of Sampi, braced against the wind, holding one of her younger siblings in her arms, the wind and dust playing across their faces: That would have made a much more striking cover. Oh, well, you know what they say: never judge a DVD by its cover. And never judge a movie by its poster.) <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed Rabbit-Proof Fence. <br /> <br />I dreaded it at first, thinking it was going to be yet another one of those swallow-your-medicine TV movies-of -the-week. You know the ones: the ones with colons in their titles, that make you feel crummy just for being alive. But Noyce's humanity, his eye for human expressions and the deeply moving performances from the kids - all the kids - won me over. <br /> <br />The documentary is what makes this DVD special, though. (A minor caveat: the documentary, long as it is, focuses exclusively on the shaping of the kids' performances, so if you're looking for other background on the making of the film, or a documentary about the historical context in which the events unfolded, you won't find it here.) <br /> <br />If you appreciated thisfilm as much as I did, do seriously consider getting this DVD. It doesn't have any of those fancy \\"special edition\\" or \\"director's cut\\" labels emblazoned on it, and the cover isn't really reperesentative of the movie inside, but it's special just the same.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Nearly thirty dollars for a CD, it better be worth it.  I didn't bother reading the reviews but songs like \\"Careless Whisper\\", \\"One More Try\\", \\"I Knew You Were Waiting for Me\\" and Michael's terrific vocals, the only European male artist to successfully reach #1 in the U.S. R&B charts, it had to be something special. The 2 disc set as mentioned before is divided into ballads \\"For the Heart\\" and dance music \\"For the Feet\\" my favorite being \\"Fast love\\" on the dance tracks. I had an instant liking to it the first time I heard it.   A remake of Bonnie Raitt's \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\" on the ballads disc, gives that song Michael's own personal blue-eyed soul feel.  Michael became popular in the U.S. with the duo Wham! then as a solo artist with 1985's pop hit album \\"Faith\\".   He is a uniquely talented musician songwriter singer of which does not come around too often.  This 2 disc set highlights his accomplishments as a performer with Wham! \\"Careless Whisper, Freedom 90\\" and as a solo performer \\"Kissing A Fool, Outside\\".  Michael is obviously influenced by rhythym & blues and he has one of the best if not the best, blue-eyed soul vocals in pop history.  Ladies & Gentlemen The Best of George Michael, to me, is worth every cent. <br />
B00004U8P9|5.0|Lots of people love this movie for the whole participation aspect of it. But to be perfectly honest I find that kind of annoying. I don't think people appreciate exactly how brilliant this movie is. I think it should have been at least nominated for best picture that year. The songs are very well written and catchy. The musical arrangements are very organic and seventies. And the comedy is wonderfully deadpan. And in the end the movie doesn't try to teach a lesson or wrap things up in a neat accessible package but rather kind of leaves you in cold. As though to bring you on a strange ride then they leave you in desolation. Genius.
B00003003R|4.0|First off, I l-o-v-e Guns N' Roses. The songs they play in this album are superb. They sound superb (maybe too good for an unedited live album...?). But when I listen to a live album, I want the songs to be different. When I listen to Led Zeppelin's \\"How The West Was Won\\" or Queen's \\"Live At Wembley Stadium\\", they change their songs. They might add a solo, make it 20 minutes longer and other such things. With this album, the songs sound the same (except for November Rain's 3 minute piano opening) as they do on the studio recordings, but with a crowd in the back. But if you like GnR, this album is definately for you, and probably if you would like to get into GnR, this album gives you a good idea of their songs.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|alright, you cannot DARE say their old stuff is better [...]  the guitarists, while they may be very talented, only played open strings and palm mutes over and over. yet as a drummer, i realize that their drummer was VERY talented, so i didnt completely give up on them. originally when i picked this up i was enthralled, i loved every minute of it. having completely abandoned nu metal since then, i discarded this album and never wanted to look back but i decided after seeing slipknot advertised with lamb of god, killswitch engage and shadows fall i figured i must be missing somethign and id try to give them another chance.     so that brigns me here. after listening to the album, i can find many examples of intelligence, talent and melody, and while this does not compare remotely to classic metal such as slayer, megadeth, metallica, etc, i cant say this album is garbage, because while slipknot remain a bit nu metal, they show a lot of promise. if they continue on this path displaying their true skills at songwriting, singing, machine gun drumming, and some average but not terrible guitar work, they may become one of my favorite bands again. DUALITY is one of my fav songs by anyone, really the best song on the album, best that they have ever recorded. you can call this a guilty pleasure of mine, but again, i think that they have made a turn for the better away from their nu metal angry teenager horsesh*t they used to crap out.     so dont let anybody saying their a real metalhead tell you their old stuff is better or even good for that matter. their old stuff blows, this is much more intelligent and slipknot are showing some promise, finally
B0001I55SS|3.0|But hey this is Disney. I think the ending was too intense and ill-explained. It's connection to 2001: A Space Odyssey is rather obvious in the climax. The storyline was perfect for a far deeper scifi film. But on the other hand the actors act more realistic than people generally did in scifi films before 2001 (the film not the year) and maybe it's just as well there is no sex implied in this film. In that way it was like an old scifi film only done with more credible acting.  BTW to one poster here. This film was released around the same month and year as Star Trek:The Motion Picture. It was not influenced by the success of ST:TMP.
0783239955|5.0|While most of my DVDs end up collecting dust, \\"The Dinner Game\\" keeps being taken out the shelf.  Why?  Whenever I have a friend visiting, this is the one I am showing them! I had to buy it 5 times already: some of my friends liked it so much I had to give it to them.  Do not be deterred by the fact it is in French with English subtitles.  Many people who loved it do not usually watch foreign movies    <br /> <br />I just cannot get tired of the jokes (and gags keep coming every 10 seconds!) The more I see it, the more reasons I find to laugh.  All the actors are excellent (and very believable) and the situations are hilarious (but yet could happen in real life) .  If you are looking for 70 minutes of non-stop laughter (yes, it is a short movie), \\"The Dinner Game\\" has all the ingredients you need!
B000089CJI|5.0|There's already 314 reviews of this, so instead of reviewing it further let me add this: <br /> <br />If you'd like another view (literally) of this group and their songs, go to [...] (coolest radio station in the country, BTW)...type in Postal Service in the search box and watch the nearly 40 minute video of them in the studio from May 2003. The video quality isn't great, but it's decent if you have a broadband connection. And most of the six songs they perform from \\"Give Up\\" sound even better than the CD version. Fantastic!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This movie was a great success in Europe, but not so much here. It was probably only released in the U.S. because of Audrey Tautou's small part in it: don't be tricked by the fact she occupies the central position on the DVD cover!  (Audrey Tautou is the lead actress in \\"Amelie\\", which I also highly recommend)    I think you can only truly appreciate this movie if you have spent a year studying abroad.  I am not saying that Americans do not do that, but it is just much more common on the other side of the Atlantic, since credits can easily be transfered from one European university to another.     I was an exchange student myself, and this movie clearly reminded me of my own experience.  Yes, finding yourself in a new town you know nothing about, with no one you know can be daunting at first!  In the movie, after Xavier gets to meet new people, Barcelona feels more and more like a second home to him.  At the end of the school year, this city has become part of him, and it is heart-breaking for him to leave what has become his true home, because he knows that he will probably never see any of these people again.  Yet, his life is changed forever as this experience helps him figure out what he truly wants to do with his life...    While the end made me nostalgic, I thought the rest of the movie was very upbeat and many of the multilingual dialogues, cultural misunderstandings and situations were just hilarious.  Imagine a Frenchman, an English girl, a German, a Swedish, an Italian and a Belgian all living together in the same apartment! You soon get attached to each of them, as they each have their own distinct personality.  Imagine the orderly German and the messy Italian sharing the same bedroom, or even the same fridge!  Those are not just stereotypes: having lived in Europe most of my life, there is some truth behind those cliches!    What is interesting about this movie is that the main character, Xavier, also has the least \\"interesting\\" personality.  Why is that?  You just absorbe what he sees through his eyes and at the end, it feels like you are the one leaving a group of friends behind in Barcelona, which truly is the main protagonist of the movie!    P.S.: If you are afraid of reading subtitles, bear in mind that a good portion of the movie (30%) is actually in English, which is the lingua franca students use inside the apartment.
B0000027RL|5.0|I got my brother this album, and after listening to it he thought it was their greatest hits album.  Nuff said.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera upped Britney Spears on her official second full studio release by co-composing most of the material, a good portion which ended up on the radio anyway.  Her delivery, the songs and compositions themselves are sterling gold; the problem is that none of the tracks, except for the Grammy-winning \\"Beautiful\\" (which Christina didn't write), are nearly as addictive or as memorable as the singles from Britney Spears' Britney or In the Zone albums.  If you're looking for one or two standout singles then you'll be sorely disappointed; heck, the majority of the tracks here are awesome, just not nearly as satisfying as \\"Toxic\\" or \\"I'm a Slave 4 U.\\"  Christina breaks new ground on Stripped, and strips away to fly away. Nonetheless, she may have stripped too far if you're looking for a palpatating listen. <br /> <br />*Note: If you're looking for quality, this is the record.  But if you're looking for a more sinfully pleasant listen, look for Britney.
0375760067|1.0|\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" ought to be the model of what a classic is not.  Books deemed as a \\"classic\\" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message.  This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect.  The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions.  Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome.  Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality.  \\"Blas&eacute;\\" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane.  After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy.  Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth.  He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth.  I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable.  I do no recommend.
B0007P3582|3.0|Although Amazon hasen't uploaded the listening clips yet as we speak, I was still able to hear his CD at Virgin MS and I have to say, I didn't expect it to be less \\"gangsta\\" than his previous debut.  <br /> <br />Even Guess whose back is more hardcore then this. The CD is still good, but it's kinda strange that he's starting to be like Ja in way by making moe tracks for the ladies and for da wankstas or wiggers.  <br /> <br />First he comes out with a CD with a title that's defined as people getting killed violently, wants to call a truce and then talks bout G unity. Although I'm still a big fan of him, that ain't gangsta fity!
0451457994|5.0|There is no other science fiction novel as good or as compelling as 2001 A Space Odyssey. I first saw the movie when I was young and I read the book last year. Every now and then, there is a science fiction novel or story with such description and intelligence that it becomes a legend in which lives in our society (The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, A Sound of Thunder, etc.). Even from the first page, I knew it would be great. That's just an understatement. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, I recommend this to anyone. It has got to be the greatest book I have ever read. After reading 2001, you could read 2010, but to me, 2010 does not match up to 2001. I guess you can say you get spoiled after reading 2001. Read this! It is the science fiction novel by which every other novel is judged.
B0007O38F8|4.0|The first time i heard this cd, i did not like a single song, I htought it was horible, but i decided to give it another chanse and spin it again. Ever since that ive been hoocked. Its not as good as his first cd, but is still good. There are a mix of different types of songs, he got the slow jams, the club bangers, and the gansta joints. Its a good cd, just give it time, and it will grow on you.
B00005A46T|5.0|I would like to give a review of the songs on this album. Slipknot rocks! <br /> <br />1.(515) 3/10 - an ok lead up track to \\"People=Sh*t\\" but it kinda sucks though <br /> <br />2. People=Sh*t 10/10 - awesome song with heavy guitar riffs and some heavy language along with it <br /> <br />3. Disasterpiece 9/10 - a pretty good song with nice and fast lyrics  <br /> <br /> <br />4. My Plague 11/10 - one hell of a song; great rap metal! <br /> <br />5. Everything Ends 7/10 - ok single; corey says the same things over and over so that kinda sucks <br /> <br />6. The Heretic Anthem 6/10 - a song that has a nice and heavy bass; I don't listen to it that much because I'm a christian and I go to a catholic school <br /> <br />7. Gently 4/10 - all corey does is yell in this one; he barely says anything <br /> <br />8. Left Behind 15/10 - the best song on the album and its great because it only says \\"b*tch.\\" The best part is the rap metal in the chorus <br /> <br />9. The Shape 10/10 - this track is fast with the drums and guitars. Hey you can actually hear what Corey says!! <br /> <br />10. I Am Hated 10/10 - I really like this song. When I'm pissed off, I'll just turn on this song to calm me down <br /> <br />11. Skin Ticket 8/10 - What the F***! this song is pretty f***ing fast!! <br /> <br />12. New Abortion 10/10 - Some great track. I can play it without getting in trouble because it has no profanity <br /> <br />13. Metabolic 9/10 - Another great rap metal track to listen to! <br /> <br />14. Iowa 5/10 - this track is ok. At least it tributes their home state <br /> <br />Well there's my list. Now go buy it and have fun listening!
B0007N1AI6|4.0|So I find out the other day that Judas Priest with Rob Halford came out  with a new album. So I decided to get this music, and I have to say I  was quite impressed. I am not sure the songs have been built yet into  my head like the old classics, but there is one reealllllyyy good song  on the new album \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" called Judas Rising. There are  also other good songs too that I like quite well, and I am sure 10  years from now, a few of these new songs will fit with me comfortably  just as the old classics do. I like the cd more everytime I hear it. It  kind of amazes me how people complain about this new album, the few  that do anyway. Now I tried to put this into perspective, and noticed  that Judas Priest rarely came out with an album in which I have liked  more than 2-3 songs on them real well, so for me this new album has  done justice. I am very picky sometimes on my music, and I don't just  \\"like\\" a song because I think the band is oh so cool. You need to take  into consideration, to come out with an album this good, and after 15  years of the original band being apart, and people in the band being in  their 50's!!!! that the sounds pumped fourth on this new album sound  far better than expected, other than far worse. <br /> <br />Most of the songs in this new Priest album have an 80's sound, so that  made me happy. A couple songs may have a bit of a modern tone, yet I  think this is because of the better recordings and higher quality  equipment and sounds, than it is actually being a band trying to  replant their roots somewhere else. Of course we will all be looking  for that high pitch hit of Halfords voice, so we can see if he still  has it. Perhaps I would have liked to hear it more on this album, but  after all, he is in his 50's, and even so, not everyone of his songs  past or present carried the almighty high pitch wail that made us  believe for a second we could take over the thrones of heaven and hell  at the same time. I would imagine anyone that remotely likes the old  Judas Priest with Rob Halford, meaning his songs that got overkill  airtime like Breaking the Law, You've Got Another Thing Coming or  Living After Midnight etc. and the songs that didn't get much airtime  like Green Manalishi, Metal Meltdown, or Victim Of Changes etc., would  in the least find this new album appealing. <br /> <br />Some of this may be opinion but over the years Judas Priest (with Halford) has made quite a few albums.  They are good at making at least 1-3 \\"great\\" songs each on most of  their original albums. Doing this over a period of time will surely add  up to filling a couple cd's with monster hit songs that you wish you  could fit all on one cd, yet can't. Some of the live songs are new  within themselves. I find a few songs of Halford and Priests live stuff  can be better than the originals.  <br /> <br />To sit and pick on each individual song in an album seems absurd,  especially if you like even at least one of the songs on it. Take that  song, love it, cherish it, and shut up. Not many bands have the powers  to make a cd where every song is a masterpiece. What put's a band into  greatness for me, is if over a period of time, they can be consistent  on a couple good songs here and a couple there, so in the end, the  result will be a nice list of the \\"Best Of\\"'s. <br /> <br />Let's go easy on the lyrics, we all know that the fairytale, and comic  book like lyrics can go with much of our finest British bands. Many  bands from this neck of the woods are mystical dreamers and fairytale  readers. I hardly see how the lyrics on this new album are anymore  corny than some of the lyrics on older Priest albums. Just more to  complain about I guess. <br /> <br />Onto Ripper Owens, taking over Priest as lead vocals. Sucks. I have  seen many reviews on Amazon.com and can't for the life of me see how  this person is compared to Halford in any way. He surely needed to do  his own thing, because he is or was not the sameas Halford. I don't  know if it is just little kids with a fascination for such a legendary  band, that they will not allow themselves to admit that it's not the  same, or if people just are hard of hearing. Either way, to me I am  hearing a huge difference between the two. I am not saying Ripper can't  sing, I am saying Ripper can't sing Rob Halford. Rob Halford is one of  the few on this planet that has one hell of an original vocal sound,  that few if any can duplicate in music consistantly. <br /> <br />I don't want to sit and bash individual people I may think are crazy,  since we all have different tastes, and pleasures when it comes to the  sound of music. However, if anyone actually thinks there is a  comparison between Halford/Priest and Ripper/Priest, than we  mine as well talk about how Tiny Tim sounds playing Pink Floyd. While  he strums away on his little strings, it may sound cute but it sure as  hell isn't the same, because he is not the original, he makes up a  different sound. Just as Ripper Owens makes a different sound, and in  no way could have ever competed with the originality that is Judas  Priest with lead singer Rob Halford. To compare the vocal sounds and  high pitched climaxes is blasphemy.  <br /> <br />I don't want someone sounding like \\"Rob Halford on steroids\\". I don't  want someone making Judas Priest sound like \\"Crazy thrash metal that  steam rolls over the original with more aggression\\". I don't want a  comparison of \\"Ripper's power vs. Halfords charisma\\". If this is the  case, than you are looking to hear another band that seems to appeal to  you more. Because there is no Judas in Judas Priest, without Rob  Halford. It's like comparing two different bands. Any similarities you  \\"think\\" you heard from number two is only going to be a copy, and  chances are, it's not going to sound better, as it surely didn't here.  Turn up the music, and listen again.  <br /> <br />It's like Pink Floyd breaking up, or losing Roger Waters. They stillhad a couple good albums, but it sure wasn't the same as Pink Floyd  with Roger Waters. Not all of us can be so lucky and pull off an Ozzy,  and make killer songs with one band, to take on a solo career and make  many more killer songs after that. Van Halen with David Lee Roth good,  Sammy bad. Forgive me for getting off track, but I'd like to slay the  person that can think Van Halen got any better than 1984. Rob Halford  wasn't the same when he left Priest to go on his own, in my opinion I  guess, or fact since it was a different band. Rob needed Priest, Priest  needed Rob, it's a shame they wasted so much time apart. In the least,  we now have them together again, for an album with some good sounds,  and a world tour. Far better than calling it quits. If this is it,  thanks at least for a last glimpse of what may have never happened.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I don't usually give music recommendations, cuz I'm sadly very out of touch with modern music.... but I just have to put a plug in for my new favorite album. Damien Rice's O. It's actually been out for about 2 years now, and I first heard of him because the song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" was the one that was played in a pretty pivotal way in the movie \\"Closer.\\" Then  more of his songs turned up in \\"In Good Company\\" and I started seeing reviews of this album in the NYTimes and elsewhere. Well, I impulsively bought the CD today and I can tell you that it's not coming out of my CD player for a long time. I think he fits in the contemporary-folk category -- the sound reminds me of old Van Morrison, and I don't think that's just cuz he's also Irish. It's a really rich sound, his voice seems almost confessional. It's good heartbreak music, the kind of CD where you don't want to do anything else while it's playing, just listen.
B0001A79JO|5.0|I love this cd. It's really sexy and feel-good. One of those great random cds to add to your collection. Crappy psychobilly or not I never get tired of hearing it.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The Way Up once again places PMG above the rest. This music pushes well beyond the borders of the expected. Pure genius (and of course rooted in the Midwest)! YOU MUST LISTEN TO THE ALBUM IN ITS UNINTERRUPTED ENTIRETY, which is the only way to \\"get it.\\" And if you have the opportunity hear it live don't hesitate. Pat and Lyle are always stretching the note as far as possible before returning us to the subtle \\"circle.\\" What a journey. Few musicians ask more of themselves(this includes the group), without a thought of what critics and fans might think, and are successful--a pursuit of perfect music. A MUST HAVE ALBUM FOR ANY JAZZ COLLECTION. 17 Grammys say enough (soon to be 18).
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is more a comment on the overall stupidity of comments which address bands drawing on past influences than it is a review of the Arcade Fire CD; which is EXCELLENT and FUN. ALL bands have ALWAYS drawn on past influences in one way or another. Shostakovich said it best when he said \\"The true artist does not BORROW - he/she STEALS!\\". So please, get over looking for influences in music - music without influences is non-existent, and probably would be quite unlistenable if it did exist. It's HOW influences are used that matters. To quote another wisely observant sage \\"It is EMOTION which rescues ANYthing from being a cliche\\".
6305910340|5.0|This film is based on the true story of Josh Waitzkin, a young chess prodigy who attained great success in the field of competitive tournament chess yet managed to remain grounded in a field notorious for consisting of maladjusted eccentrics such as the Bobby Fischer of the title.  He manages this by maintaining strong connections to the world outside the rarefied atmosphere of chess addicts who live, eat, and breathe the game at the risk of losing touch with all else.  This balance doesn't come naturally, though.  The primary dramatic tension in this film comes from the question of what one owes to one's own gifts-if you are able to perform at the level of genius, do you have an obligation to do so?  To whom is this obligation owed?  And how much should be sacrificed in its name?  This is a powerful film about decent, intelligent people dealing with these issues and emerging triumphant.  This film is packed with terrific actors giving great performances.  Young Max Pomeranc, who plays Josh, holds his own against such heavy hitters as Joe Mantegna, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley, and Laurence Fishburne./
B00005JNQQ|5.0|Let's get the easy parts out of the way: the animation is incredible. That cross-town ride is pretty hard to forget, and the dominoes were a nice set-piece. What kept working, though, was that all of the robots were unique, and there were hundreds of them, maybe thousands, sometimes hundreds in a single scene. And they all moved right! That's a pretty big statement when \\"right\\" means \\"right for that particular body\\", and all the bodies were different. Even complex motions, like roller-derby, came across well. Technical excellence is easy, though. (If you're a super-nerd, watch for the reflections.)<br /><br />Good characters are hard, and good relationships are harder. Yes, this is a movie for kids, so we're not talking about any deep subtleties. Still, you really care about Rod Copperbottom, you really feel for his parents, you really like Aunt Fanny even if you'd never want to be seen in public with her, and it's kind of sweet that Mr. Bigweld likes her for her conspicuous assets. And a little bathroom humor never hurts.<br /><br />Nor does a charmingly manic performance by Robin Williams. The whole production team seems to have caught his spirit, and keeps the little visual and verbal jokes coming in a steady stream. Remember what I said about good motion? That even translated into physical humor. Movies like \\"Final Fantasy\\" may look good, but can't deliver a prat-fall that you'll really believe.<br /><br />OK, maybe you won't remember this one in ten years. Still, whhen you see it again, you'll like it again. It's fun, it's put together well in just about every way, and it's kid-safe. And there's plenty to keep an adult amused while s/he chaperones the li'l darlin'. Enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005V331|5.0|It takes a great band to have so little musical ability yet still record an album that'll stick in your head twenty-five years later. For those unfamiliar with Venom's tactics, don't let poor production or sloppy presentation fool you. Every track on this album is of an anthematic quality, and in the history of metal itself, Welcome To Hell is considered by most to be the birth of the extreme (I give more credit to Motorhead though). This bonus edition also comes with tons of goodies not found on the original which may or may not impress newcomers to the artist.  <br /> <br />When in doubt understand this: thousands of garage bands who choose to cover \\"100 Days In Sodom\\" before tracks from your favorite band cannot be wrong!  <br /> <br />-l-
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|I admit, I came late to Miyazaki's work. I first saw things like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and now I'm working my way down the list of his older movies.<br /><br />Nausica&auml; is a welcome addition to that list. It has the Miyazaki trademarks of a strong young girl as the lead character, and a fascination with flight. This time, the girl (she's Nausica&auml;) is princess of a small band of people. The live on the edge of the Toxic Forest, a lethal piece of ecological wreckage from some hinted-at catastrophe a thousand years before. Nausica&auml; has a unique affinity for the beings in that forest, including the Ohmu who guard it. The forest and village come under attack, and she discovers just how her people depend on that forest despite its hazards.<br /><br />This movie is a very likeable and reasonably kid-safe, despite some monsters, fighting, and mildly graphic injury. It's also clear that this is one of Miyazaki's earlier works, a step on the way to his current greatness. A lot of the plot, especially early on, is driven by a \\"talking to myself\\" mechanism instead of real visual storytelling. The Nausica&auml; character is closer to the long-legged, micro-skirted anime standard than his later characters, and the animation lacks the fluency of his later work. These are minor problems, though, and it's interesting to see how Miyazaki outgrew them.<br /><br />This is another enjoyable film from Miyazaki. I fault it only for not meeting the standards that Miyazaki set in his later work, but it's still miles ahead of most other animation.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B000002HPV|5.0|I brought this CD for 'Alarm Call', (the challenging, yet relaxing vibes of the album) hoping to find the radio edit, but instead I found a slight difference to the track, which is a lot better. The album as a whole is very different from any of her others, I've only just begun to understand the power and emotion put into each song. It's unbelieveable! There's one song that seems to stick out in my mind, the banshee styles of 'Pluto', everyone I've played it to has given me a thumbs down, but I really enjoy it; It's something to keep you awake, at least.  <br />The 'All is Full of Love' that is featured is completely different to the radio version, it lacks the instrumental backing that Bjork's voice is most suited for. Apart from that, everything else is perfect and up to the electronica standards that I'd expect from Iceland's biggest superstar.

That is, we stand on the abyss of a global pandemic, a wildfire-like viral event that will start like the flick of a matchstick, then burn everything in its path, leaving civil disorder and misery in its aftermath on an unprecedented-scale. But what can we do other than prepare ourselves for the inevitable--death of our society as we know it? I mean other than prudent physical safety and medical precautions, we can also boost our immune systems psychologically against the true number one killer: s-t-r-e-s-s. Just look at what has happened to millions of people impacted by natural disasters in the past couple years alone from earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis, yet alone the warfare in Africa and the Middle East.

0671027387|5.0|This is the third Dan Brown book I've read, the other two being Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. While Brown is definitely a formula writer (important guy dies, Langdon teams up with his daughter or something close, they go hunting clues while a mysterious bad guy hides behind the scenes to the very end), and Deception Point follows this formula somewhat, Deception Point has more of a political implication to it. The thrills are quick, the twists are appalling, and it holds you to the very end. While I would say that this book is somewhat easier to...anticipate... than other Browns, the twist at the end threw me out the windy.<br /><br />After one reads ol Danny for while, you kinda understand how he writes. Thrills that come later in the book due to some new discovery could've been seen way earlier with some insight, but he's gotta make a living I guess. You gotta remember that he writes fiction, and while the book is set in our modern world, some truths are twisted for more drama. Nevertheless, if you like Dan Brown, or even if you like sci-fi and/or thrillers, you will absolutely love this book.
B0001I55OC|2.0|I'm not a \\"Michael Crichton purist\\" or any of the obsessive terms you can come up with. The novel \\"Timeline\\" was absolutely amazing, everyone I've recommended it to has loved it as well. After I first finished it, I thought that it had to be a movie, and if it wasn't turned into one, I'd write the darn thing myself. Well here you are, it's a movie and a very disappointing one at that. I wouldn't have changed anything to the book, but the movie took away just about everything and twisted the plot a bit too. It turns it into a shallow time travel into medieval times with some romance movie. There WAS a lot of romance in the book, don't get me wrong, but it's so cheesy in this movie. How much of that book can you really fit into 90 something minutes? I think it would have been much better as a miniseries.  <br /> <br />The upside?? Gerard Butler, period end of sentence. Every other female who's written a review has commented about him too, but he really is a very good actor. I was surprised when I first saw him in \\"Lara Croft: Cradle of Life\\" and then in \\"Atilla\\" and \\"Timeline\\" and especially \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". I look forward to seeing him in more movies.
B00003CX95|2.0|I've no idea what the English ever did to Mel Gibson, but he's certainly sticking it to us - seemingly on a one-man mission to demonise the entire race.  <br /> <br />What with this and the Patriot, I'm surprised he didn't recast the Romans as English in the Passion of Christ... <br /> <br />What of course he is doing is tapping in to an underlying sense of unease if not downright hatred Americans have for their former \\"rulers\\". Some of the scenes in the film are crude examples of this - the way the Irish are used as cannon fodder (hey, remind me to renew my subscription to the IRA) or the outrageously gay English prince cuckolded by the virile Celt (indeed, many English people are beginning to think we've been screwed by the Yanks for years).   <br /> <br />As it happens the English king \\"Longshanks\\" was one of the more progressive rulers of his time and helped kick-start the parliamentary process in England - a much longer time coming for our long-suffering brethren across the border - which in turn would inspire the very values of liberty Americans hold so dear. <br /> <br />So when you next cheer on the put-upon colonists or Celts you might bear in mind that the people you are so keen on demonising defined the values you live by today.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Beautiful and enchanting soundscapes and top-notch production is what makes \\"Thirteenth Step\\" audible. It's ambient, sometimes minimalist, and even compelling. But the good qualities are against themselves on this album. The music might be good but it's still not very adventurous. The great ideas and artistic expression are stilted by a lack of variance and interesting song structures. But Maynard is what kills this album! These lyrics suck and every 15 year old out there is walking around thinking they're cool by saying, \\"Your halo is coming down to choke you.\\" Oh please. Maynard's lyrics just suck nowadays (now that he's rich and comfortable), he takes cruddy highschool poetry to a new level on this one. I hope when Tool's \\"IQ\\" comes out, Maynard will stop with the crap.
B00029LNHS|4.0|I finally bought this CD after hearing/seeing several cuts on the music networks and I'm glad that I did.  I was taken about with 'Let's get retarded' but then realized I was reacting like an over zealous idiot.  The song and the words in its context is not to offend mentally challenged people.  The rest of the tracks are great to bob your head and shake what your mama gave ya--so yes, overall I highly recommend this CD!
B000683VI4|4.0|Rich girl meets poor guy.  They fall in love.  Rich girl's parents nix the romance.  They're still in love.  She becomes engaged to another man.  They're still in love.  And so it goes...as Allie and Noah go through a lifetime of barriers to an unlikely, but never-ending love story.  The acting is good, the scenery is beautiful, and all in all this is a great tear-jerker.  In his autobiography/travelogue, Three Weeks With My Brother, Nicholas Sparks writes that this book is based on his grandparents' love story.  That makes this movie even more poignant.  Watch this movie, but don't forget the Kleenex box.
0380729407|5.0|No, that's not the title of a new self-help book, it's the title of my review of \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", a story that captures the awesome freedoms and fears of youth, as well as the potent yearnings of age.<br /><br />I read this as a student and enjoyed it, and recently read it again after entering my mid 30s. I am now at a point between the two extremes that Bradbury dissects in this timeless (pun) merry-go-round (pun) of an a-fair (pun). OK, three puns in a row deserves a bad rating for this review, but what else can I do? The book is a classic, and will live as long as men and women look forward or backwards through their lives and reflect on what could be.<br /><br />I could chirp about how Bradbury has such eloquence and how he can construct a phrase with more spirit and humanity than should be possible, but if you want all that just read the jacket cover - greater readers and writers than I have said it all before.<br /><br />All I can do is verify that the story still holds true, and still stirs both boyish and manly emotions, even as I begin to see the shape of middle age forming in the mist of my future.
B000002LPD|5.0|Personally, I'm not a big fan of the previous Van Halen releases, 5150, and OU812. I'm your typical David Lee Roth fan. I bought this album used for only a dollar here off Amazon. It came in almost perfect condition. I popped it in, and listened to \\"Poundcake\\" a song I have heard many times before, but I thought was an ok song. Eddie wasn't the first person to come up with the drill idea, but he uses it well. Next I heard the song \\"Judgement Day,\\" a song I had heard was a very good song. The song completely blew me away. I had heard Right Now, Runaround, 316, and Top Of The World before, and they're all pretty good songs, but the other songs like the interesting technology sounding \\"Man On A Mission,\\" and the other rocking songs \\"The Dream Is Over,\\" and \\"Pleasure Dome\\" are very hard rocking songs. This CD is a classic and is definately the best of Hagar. A must have for any rock fan.
B0006SSOHM|3.0|Okay, I had about three girls from my school say \\"Oh my God, this movie is scarier than the Ring!\\" I'm terrified of The Ring for some unknown reason (as well as The Grudge but that's another story) so it completely turned me off against seeing it. Then last night, I stayed the night with my friend and she owned it and said \\"Let's watch it.\\" (Saw, duh). I was a bit antsy but whatever, so I went downstairs with her and we watched it, but before we did she was like \\"This movie is sooo scary. I mean, more than The Grudge, more than The Ring, more than the Sixth Sense.\\" that right there made me feel MUCH better (note the sarcasm) but as I watched it I was like 'Geez, this isn't even a horror flick, it's a flippin mystery!'. My friend screamed throughout the whole movie and I just stared at it like \\"Wow. I wonder what's gonna happen next.\\".  <br />Personally, if you're a big horror buff, you might not like this movie all too much. But if you're interesed in shows like CSI, Third Watch, and mystery movies, go ahead and be my guest.
0451526015|4.0|I would first like to start by saying that The Picture of Dorian Gray is, by far, one on my favorite novels. And were I not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel I would have given it 5 stars, without a doubt.<br /><br />It is a fabulous story, I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />[As a small sidenote -- I would simply like to say that Wilde's particular style of writing is one which I do, in general, find rather enjoyable.]I have heard some people say that they found this book diffucult to muddle through. I was not one of these people.<br /><br />Also, The other stories in this book are not bad at all. I enjoyed The Happy Prince quite thoroughly. - *note this particular \\"fairy tale\\" was very reminiscent of Hans Christian Anderson's writings.<br /><br />THE FLAW(S)! I blame the editor for this one -- this book, as far as I have been able to find, does not include the alternate(slightly more drawn-out) ending to this novel. I was, needless to say, a little upset by this missing detail. (If I have merely overlooked this extended ending, by all means let me know)<br /><br />ANOTHER SMALL FLAW -<br /><br />If you have not read the book DO NOT, i repeat DO NOT, begin by reading the AUTHORS NOTE. Although the authors note was very insightful and generally enjoyable to read - it easily gives away more than half the plot. The authors note is a spoiler -- BEWARE.<br /><br />Overall , still a great novel. Not so happy with the editor.
B000002J09|5.0|After seeing that this cd was not 5 stars, I just have to review it. Led Zeppelin has to be one of the if not greatest bands of all time, and this is their best album. Every single song on this album is 5 stars. It has thier best songs on it too: Stairway, Rock and Roll, Black Dog...every single song on this album seems to be their best.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is an awesom album, its the one that moves me, and should move you. Its one of those albums where if u liscen to each song one by one, they're all great. But when u liscen tot he whole album, from start to finish, in order, its an entirly new experience. A must buy for sure.
B00004Z459|3.0|I bought 'Hybrid Theory' when I was 12. My musical tastes have matured a great deal since then, but I still listen to this album from time to time. It's hardly the best album ever, but there are quite a few strong points contrary to what your average hipster/metal elitist will have you think.  <br /> <br />Brad Delson (LP guitarist) is by no means on the same level as Jimmy Page or Kerry King, but he is very underrated and he has a lot more depth to his playing than the powerchords of the radio singles would suggest. As depth goes, the same can be said for drummer Rob Bourdon and DJ Joseph Hahn who shows his immense skill in the instrumental track 'Cure For The Itch'. Mike Shinoda is a decent rapper, and Chester Bennington's vocals and the passion he shows live are awesome. The band's lyrics show flashes of excellence in tracks such as 'By Myself' and 'With You' but unfortunately tracks like 'Crawling and 'One Step Closer' are mediocre, sanitised angst. A lot of the sampling is good, although it would be better if there was more Mixmaster Mike-style quirkiness in that department. <br /> <br />Recap: 'Hybrid Theory' is a good debut album. It, along with 'Meteora', promises a lot from Linkin Park but I feel that the band can only deliver to their full potential if they get rid of Don Gilmore, who is responsble for a lot of the mediocrity and predictability here. The band are both talented individuals and a good unit, who fuse hip-hop and classic rock really well. They really, really don't deserve to be lumped in with KoRn and Limpbizkit. <br />What's more, this record also helped me discover a lot of other bands such as Led Zeppelin, Refused, Black Flag and Nine Inch Nails.  <br />Ignore the metalheads who dismisss this as 'false metal' (even though the band have never claimed to be metal) and the hipsters who would rather listen to repetitive copycat crap such as Franz Ferdinand. Listen to the samples on offer here and listen for yourself. I'm not a teeny.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is really one of the finest piece of music my ears had ever listen to. <br />Since the first album, U2 made even better and better music.  <br />Unfortunately, after \\"The Joshua Tree\\" U2 went DOWN and almost all the rest music they made after this album is even not worth of mention it. Sad thing what fame and money made from one of the finest bands. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO BUY AND LISTEN TO! <br />
B000089CKH|4.0|This is a decent cd, I especially like the tracks \\"Inside of Love\\" \\"Killian's Red\\" and \\"Fruit Fly\\".  However sthe overall tone of this cd seems to drag on a little bit.  It seems like Nada are unable to find a comfortable balance between the laid back slow tempo songs and the fast upbeat rockers.  Overall this is a quality cd that almost everyone could enjoy, and it is great to see Nada keep changing with their sound.
B000002AT6|5.0|I only recently discovered the film LEGENDS OF THE FALL and subsequently the soundtrack, so I was surprised as I listened to it how often I kept thinking back to the oh-so-ingrained music from the blockbuster TITANIC.  I hadn't previously made the connection that it was the same composer and if you don't mind how similar the two scores are, then you will enjoy this collection of grandly orchestrated melodies.
0316666343|1.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" was a unique book told from a fresh angle.  Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets.  When the first lines  in the story are \\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973,\\" you assume it can only get better.  It doesn't.  The writing is good enough but not believable as coming from a fourteen-year old.  \\"The Lovely Bones\\" loses its credibility with sentences like \\"Other than that, they melted into the gender-subdivided world of their peers.\\" and \\"....\\"as Samuel took the daring step of kissing Lindsey in a room full of family, became borne aloft way from it.\\"<br /><br />If this was a story narrated by the parents or other middle-aged adult, it might have passed for a decent accounting of the family's trek through the hell of dealing with the pain of a murdered daughter.  Instead, it just misses the mark and leaves you feeling cheated somehow.  The one scene where Susie gets to live out a fantasy feels contrived and just doesn't fit in with the rest of the story.  The serial killer's demise is flat and the mother's way of dealing with the tragedy is just not plausible to me, especially the way she is treated after so many years, save her young son's honesty.<br /><br />This book is proof though, how hype and advertising can make a best seller even if there isn't any substantiation for it between the pages.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Such a simple movie, but thats the reason why its so great. This film has made it into my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Sit back, relax, open your mind and enjoy!
6302787556|3.0|As far as movies go, this one was a load of crap.  The Nation of Islam and its founder, Elijah Mohammed were nothing more than hypocritical racists hiding behind their religion.  The first half of this movie seemed more like a propaganda piece for the Nation of Islam, than a biography.<br /><br />The second half of the movie began focusing on Malcolm noticing all of the holes in the Nation's philosophy and structure. He begins to realize that he's been hustled by the organization, who wanted to use his intelligence and charisma for their own means. It also focuses on their attempts to undermine Malcolm's position in the organization, when his own popularity begins to rise, culminating in their first attempt to have him killed. This is when he realizes his own potential, leaves the organization, and rediscovers himself.  He also abandons the Nation of Islam's racist beliefs.<br /><br />Apparently Michael Jordan wearing an \\"X\\" hat is something we all must see to understand Malcolm. This movie deserves to be redone, and if its done right, could be phenomenal.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Firstly, let me say that it is important to bear in mind that many (although not all) of the changes contained in this release of Star Wars are to be credited to the 1997 rerelease and not this DVD issuing.  With that having been said, I still must say that I am disappointed that George Lucas made his other changes to synchronize the continuity between his new movies with this one.  His goal should have been the oposite (to synchronize his new works with his older masterpieces).  This, in my opinion is lazy directing. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, if one can look past the changes made, the movies still are wonderful.  We all know them so well by this point.  While it would be preferable that we were given the movies in their original condition, we have received them as such.  It is difficult for any to imagine episodes 4,5, and 6 in any way that is not filled with awe.  In the core, the DVDs are still those classics which are so beloved.  That is why I must say that they are indeed sullied but only topically.  Substantially, they remain what we love.  While Lucas et al. are culpable for their changes, the did not ruin the original vision of Star Wars.  Therefore, I still suggest this set for any who feel that it is time to renew their collection (being that the VHS copies may be getting old).  The classic, though stained topically, is still that which is known and loved.
B000777J2S|5.0|Antony takes risks on this album, which is clearly more emotionally vulnerable and musically adventurous than his brilliant debut. The result is still sublime.
B00003CXQY|5.0|I am with the majority of the reviewers of this movie - it is one of the best comedies I have ever seen.  Like \\"Groundhog Day\\", I could (and have) watched this one over and over again.  This movie is laugh out loud funny no matter how many times I've seen it. <br />It's not a misleading tear-jerker like \\"Bambi\\" (hunters are not all bad people!), nor is it an inappropriate love story like \\"The Little Mermaid\\" (a 16 year old girl falling in love and leaving her family forever?  Is this a good lesson?).  The villianess Yzma isn't terrifyingly scary like so many of the others in Disney movies.  This is definitely one I love to watch with my 4 year old daughter.
B00006JDS4|1.0|I watched this when I was a young girl & it still haunts me to this day.  If you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you.
B00007AJF9|1.0|It might be pretty - I don't know, I found it to be too nauseating.  I have read several biographies of Elizabeth, so I was very interested when this movie came out.  Forget disappointing, this movie was appalling.  Its only semblance to history were the names used.  If you're looking for a bit of entertainment with sex and violence in costume, and you have no respect for the reputations of real people who lived and died four hundred years ago, you might like this movie.  If you watch it, please remember that, as a source of historical insight on the characters of Elizabeth and her court, this movie is complete and utter garbage.
B000096I9G|5.0|Load up on \\"baked goods\\" and enjoy the genius of robert smith.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is probably one of my favourite movies of all time and I am incredibly delighted that it has finally seen the light of day uncut in North America. The horribly altered Warriors of the Wind (an early dub of the film back in the 80s) had rekindled an interest in Japanese animation in me that picked up where Battle of the Planets left off and I have been a fan of director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghiblis output ever since. <br />Miyazakis later films (all of which are great)certainly look better than Nausicaa (such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away) and theres no debating that, but considering this was only his second job as director for a theatrical film and it was made in something like 3 months (his later films have taken more than a year) it still holds up pretty well. It is starting to show its age of course, 20 years after it was originally released, but Miyazakis story telling still stands tall.<br />I have mixed feelings about the new dub, which to my ears is the worst sounding of the Disney releases of Miyazakis films. It is an improvement over the Warriors of the Wind dub where Nausicaa sounded like Rocky the Squirrel (and it is an urban myth that it was the same voice actor as Rocky), but it does suffer from a lot of Explaino (a comic book method of explaining the plot details to viewers things that would be immediately obvious to the characters themselves).  However, a lot of that is present in the Japanese script, so it cant be solely blamed on Disney. Most of the actors are fine in their roles (where else can you get the Captain of the Enterprise and the (new) Cmdr. Adama together in one sci-fi related film?). However, Alison Lohman has a tough job in trying to convey the intricacies to Nausicaaa character and while its not bad, just doesnt convey it as well as her Japanese counterpart.<br />Commenting on some of the other reviews I have read for this film, there seems to be a lot misinformation out there. The music in Nausicaa is unchanged  its exactly the same as the original Japanese release (the CD is available on Tokuma 35ATC-3 and is great as well). The script is faithful to the original and for the most part is the same as most fan translations Ive seen and my limited Japanese language ability can tell. The complaints about the slow pacing in parts are valid, but this type of introspection is common in most Japanese cinema, from the classics of Kurosawa and Ozu, to even other weel known animations such as Ghost in the Shell. Its a cultural quirk that makes Japanese movies unique from their US counterparts and I for one dont have a problem with it. A lot of these scenes were cut in Warriors in the Wind, and while it made for a tighter, action packed film, it removed a lot of details in what motivates Nausicaa to do what she does. Without character, theres no heart.<br />Also, there are a lot of people who compare the film to the manga (comic) version by Miyazaki. The film was created about 10 years before the serialization of the manga was completed, so obviously there are going to be huge differences between the two. Only about 2 volumes of the 7-volume work were completed at that time. Comparing the two is like apples and oranges. The scope of the film is by necessity limited, but that doesnt make the end result better (or worse) than its source material.  The manga is a sprawling epic and is much darker and mature than the film would lead one to believe however. Its well worth checking out as well. Its highly unlikely that the entire story will ever be animated and with Princess Mononoke more or less a sequel in spirit (since it touches on the same themes as Nausicaa -- the film and manga) I think Miyazaki may have said all that he wants about the subject.
B00005AQE8|5.0|First of all, who's the moron who compared 2Pac (the greatest rapper of all time) to Lil' Jon (an annoying spoof who is better off staying on the other side of the studio glass as a producer)??  Obviously, this person wasn't old enough to actually buy a 2Pac album when it came out (and he was alive).  I was, and I still remember the excitement of going to the record store and buying All Eyez On Me.  As one of the most hyped rap albums of all time, it certainly lived up to all the fanfare.  2Pac was the first to release a double rap cd, and it annhilated everything out at the time.  It is at this time of his life when his lyrics are bursting with emotion (positive and negative), and he truly found his voice.  Sadly, we now have albums on which his vocals are butchered and paired with the likes of Elton John, 50 Cent, and whoever else wants taint his genuine material with mixes and voiceovers.  I bet he's turning over in his grave.  If he was still around today, he'd still be shredding up the rest of the rappers out there (if you can call the bubble gum, bling bling, \\"look at my platinum teeth and spinning medallion\\" crap out there rap).
B0007GAEW6|3.0|I have to express initial disappointment with Frances the Mute. I immediately loved De-loused, but while Frances shares some sensibility with that CD, it tries its best to be as tuneless as possible. De-loused, even with its intricate arrangements and spastic riffing still managed the near-impossible feat of having hooks in the vocals. I found it hard to get the songs out of my head. Days later, I cant say the same of Frances. It seems like Mars Volta have taken the elements that I disliked from the last CD (and I am not delusional in that I think they did this solely for my benefit) and made them the primary focus for this new one, missing the things that made De-loused so great I n my mind. <br />This is a challenging work, no question about it and I may grow to like it more than I do now, but if like me you didnt love every aspect of De-Loused, you may want to pass. Those that thoroughly devoured the last CD will probably relish the effort it will take to really get into Frances the Mute. While I think this is a mis-step, I applaud Mars Volta for trying to push their style further into even more challenging areas and not follow up with a complete retread of what they have done previously. If they could stop with the 3-minute interludes of ambient noise and sounds, I think the next CD may be the worthy successor to De-loused.
B00005JNQQ|5.0|My 5 year old will remember this movie for a long time. He is still talking about it the next day. I wouldn't mind going to see it again. There is great graphics for all to enjoy. The story line is precious and any parent would like the message it delivers to our kids. The cast is perfect to their robot they play. There was plenty of laugh out loud moments. I immediately got out of the theater and started making phone calls to other friends to make sure they take their kids out to see it. Anyone would enjoy this movie. It is worth the time and money to go out and see it.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I admit to not being a huge Green Day fan. Their discography to this point hasn't really interested me although I felt that Dookie was quite a promising start. It didn't really pay off for me as I began losing more interest in the band with each subsequent release. You can imagine that I wasn't looking forward to American Idiot either. The eponymous single didn't really do much to sway my opinion either so I was wary when listening to this album. <br /> <br />American Idiot is pleasantly surprising. This album is much different from Dookie-era Green Day although She's a Rebel and St.Jimmy retain the vintage Green Day feel. Those two along with American Idiot and Holiday make up the worst this album has to offer. This new direction the band has chosen to undertake really pays of on this album. <br /> <br />American Idiot is a concept album such that the lyrics and songs all work in tandem to tell a complete story. For the most part, this works pretty well. Lyrically, this is one of their strongest albums. However, some songs aren't too strong in this aspect. American Idiot and Holiday feel to forced with pretty uninspired lyrics that don't really have much depth. The rest of the album is pretty well written with the highlight being Jesus of Suburbia. This 9 minute track could have easily been passed off as four independent tracks. There are parts in the song such as the \\"Hey\\" chants behind Billie Joe Armstrong's voice that work extremely well. The odd tempo changes(For a pop-punk track), strong lyrics and nice melodies work really well with Billie's voice to what amounts to one of the best pop-punk tracks ever. <br /> <br />There are also strong ballads here. Their second single Boulevard of broken dreams is a well realized slow song with a great chorus. Are We Waiting is a strong anthemic tune built on some great guitar lines. Give Me Novacaine is a faster ballad built upon some strong drum lines and tempo changes. Extraordinary Girl is a strong ballad with a somewhat Indian feel that reminds me of Dream Theater's Solitary Shell. <br /> <br />All of this works really well together. The album stumbles a bit with some of the faster, rougher tracks like American Idiot. If you're basing your opinion of the album on the singles then you might be missing out on a lot. Even if you don't care for the singles, there is a lot here to enjoy. Billie Joe Armstrong doesn't have the best voice out there, nor is the instrumental work terribly great but the simplicity of the music and the good lyrics work really well in tandem. This is a very surprising release from a maturing band. The sound is a lot different here than in past releases but I feel it to be a step forward. This is one of the strongest albums ever in the pop-punk genre. While not perfect, American Idiot really bodes well for the future of Green Day. I eagerly await their next album. Check American Idiot even if you're not a fan of Green Day's earlier albums, you might become a fan like me. 4 stars.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This runs the gamut from \\"too real\\" to \\"not real at all\\". I am at a loss of words to describe this film. It is easy to relate to the main character, but it reminds us of our dark side just beneath the surface (the one that we all try to hide or ignore). The ending is not quite expected, but not staggering considering the situation. Definitely an under-rated film.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|From the creators of Ice Age comes this nice little animated feature about Robots. In this one, the Bigweld Company has a new owner, the evil Ratchet, voiced by Greg Kinnear, who is out to replace all the old robots, so called \\"outmodes\\" and replace their parts with expensive upgrades to make them look sleek and shiny. Of course, our band of plucky heroes led by inventor Rodney Copperbottom(Ewan McGregor) and including Fender(Robin Williams).    The animation here is decent enough. The world and all it's mechanical contraptions but it just doesn't hold up when compared to other animated features of our time, whether from Pixar, Dreamworks or even Japanese animation. The soundtrack is nice and pleasant and the voice cast is pretty strong in names although the delivery is a bit lackluster. None of the characters stand out particularly. Even Robin Williams who is usually excellent doesn't add much here. The humor and script isn't all that great as well. The jokes are mostly aimed at children and Robots lacks the many pop culture references or adult jokes that Shrek or Pixar releases had.    Robots is a bit of a disappointment when compared to recent releases like The Incredibles. The animation and voice acting are only passable and the humor is mostly aimed at children meaning that adults won't enjoy it as much as with other animated features. Your kids will probably enjoy this film as it does feature a colorful cast of characters and some decent humor aimed at them.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Pros: Innovative as ever, blending many styles of music, and well. <br />Cons: Not as solid musically (as the first LP), but the production stepped it up (which doesn't necessarily cover for the minor slip on the music factor). <br /> <br />Coming in with their second full length LP, The Mars Volta again proves to be one of the newest, most creative bands put together today (thank the Universe...we need more of them!). With their explosive jams, intense spaces set in between songs, gliding into Spanish vocals and Latin grooves, I again salute Omar and crew in manifesting an album so original, that you'll never hear anything like it anywhere...ever most likely.  <br />Like all amazing musical acts out there today or in the past (TOOL, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, The Beatles, and King Crimson), no one is able to mimic, or re-create these beautiful creations these bands have set down here on Earth for us.  <br /> <br />While I definitely do not find this album as solid musically as De-Loused, I do find the production aspect of it has taken a turn on the upside (which is quite interesting considering Rick Rubin produced De-Loused),.  <br /> <br />Now, if LP #3 combines these two - BINGO - you might even have a more solid album than De-Loused and Fraces put together...we'll see!  <br /> <br />A band surrounded by death will make intense, erratic, yet beautifully orchastrated music, and that is just what The Mars Volta has done once again. Bravo a thousand times over!
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Over two decades ago, the Disney film \\"Tron\\" with its computer-generated images was supposed to revolutionize filmmaking.  Coupled with a rather weak script and wooden direction, the film didn't accomplish its goal at the time, only recently acquiring \\"cult\\" status.<br /><br />2004's \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" was supposed to do the same thing, and may have accomplished that feat in a mild way, showing that a movie could be created with actors responding to direction while acting on a blue screen set.  Unfortunately, there lies the film's biggest weakness.  The actors seem unsure as to what they are reacting and it shows.  Like such effects-laden predecessors as \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Spawn,\\" the performers' reactions are either too slow or quirky, revealing the actors' doubts about how they should respond to the director's on-screen intent.<br /><br />Combining cutting-edge computer effects, comic book-like espionage, elements of film noir (in sepia tones, no less), globetrotting daring do, and 1930's set pieces, the film is too over-the-top to be believed.  The producers may have thought they were paying homage to early films but I feel that they borrowed a bit too heavily from the older, and much better, films.<br /><br />Check out the sound effects of The Iron Giant-like robots' laser beams, identical to those produced by the Martian spacecraft in George Pal's \\"War of the Worlds\\".  The battles over the skies of Manhattan look like they were lifted from any installment of Max Fleischer's \\"Superman\\" shorts of the 1940's.  Didn't Roger Moore have a car that turned into a submarine in 1977's \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\"?  It might not be a car, but Law's plane does a remarkably similar feat.<br /><br />And how many times since 1937's real-life Hindenburg disaster can one see a dirigible explode???<br /><br />Besides the obvious \\"salutes\\" to \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" the film also lifts from \\"Mars Attacks\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\".<br /><br />As for the cast, Jude Law is a bit too small in stature and refined to be the \\"rugged hero\\" and \\"savior of the world\\".  Gwyneth Paltrow tries her best to be \\"the girl Friday\\" but she's saddled with lines that are so awful that her drama teacher must be wincing.  She, at least, gets to sing \\"Over the Rainbow\\" in the closing credits, and affords herself adequately.  Jolie, sporting a sexy eye patch and form-fitting outfit, gets to make what amounts to an extended cameo.  Her English accent isn't too bad, though.<br /><br />And the credits do state that the estate of Sir Laurence Olivier did approve of his image and voice being used in the film.  Well, I know \\"Larry\\" is grimacing in his grave.<br /><br />When I saw the theatrical trailer for the film prior to its release, I wondered what were Law, Paltrow, and Jolie doing in a sci-fi epic.<br /><br />Now that I have viewed the entire film, I'm still wondering.<br /><br />I wonder do they still have the same agent, respectively.d to be the \\"rugged hero\\" and \\"savior of the world\\".

B00005N83M|3.0|What is it with you people? This girl does not have a terrible voice, she is such a beautiful and pure singer with many talents like acting and dancing. Ok, first of all, this is not one of my favourite albums but it is still pretty decent. There are some good tracks on here like \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\", \\"I'm Real\\", \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" and the best song \\"I'm Real [Murder Remix]\\", but there are also some pretty bad songs on here too. In general, this is a pretty good album and I would recommend it to any Jennifer fan.
B000002H2H|5.0|I think i was just wrong when it said be the first person to review this album when i clicked on reviews... but whatevr. Master of Puppets is definantly there best album, but that doesnt mean i have to like it more than Ride the Lightning. My 2 favorite songs on this album are the title track and Call of Ktulu which coincidently im listening to right now. They brought Dave Mustaine in on this album to do some stuff, and my friend thinks Kirk Hammet replaced Mustaine for lead guitarist for Metallica but i think Dave was never actually a full time bandmember, It doesnt look like he was included in the making of Kill em all and just helped with a couple of songs on this slbum. So theres my logic. Probably am wrong though. Geting back to the greatness of this album fight fire with fire starts out all cheerfull and pleasant like ur strolling through the park on a summers day. Then about 30 seconds into the song we start to hear are more familiar Metallica fast and loud and ur pleasnt day is ruined when an escaped fugitive runs at u screaming and throtles u to the ground and kills u with pleasure. this song has one of the most interesting sounding guitar solos iv heard from Metallica the second guitar solo is just really interesting i think. I really like the guitar solos on this album. especially in Ride The Lightning, i think that has to be my second favorite Metallica song, my first favorite song from Metallica is ...And Justice for All (which is my favorite song ever also). Another kick ass song is Fade to Black which is the more slower side of Metallica that we hear sometimes. It just has that tone to it that i cant explain because im so stupid, but it just has that tone to it. And then there is Call of Ktulu. This song is prety god dam great i dont care if u like it or hate the song but just give ur respect to its greatness. The song is all instrumental and reapeats itself a couple of times but it just sounds so awesome it doesnt mater.<br /><br />At 8 minutes and 53 seconds the song is the perfect closure to this masterpiece of an album. For someone new to Metallica this should be the first album of them u get. It turned me into a fan of Metallica.
0440178002|5.0|This novel, while considered fiction is largely based on actual events and the characters names have been slightly altered from their actual historical names. I guess for some there is not enough action to keep them interested. In my option these people missed the whole point of the story. Too often people have minimized the Samurai to just warriors and their story's must be about wars. Instead this novel focuses on the traditions and customs of the Japanese people at that time and how wars were fought behind the scenes. The motivations behind each person. I find this more entertaining and interesting.
B00001QGPS|3.0|Method Man and Redman on the same album? Yes, I couldn't believe it either. You have two of the greatest rappers of all time collaborating on something other that a weed smokeout. This could have potentially been one of the greatest rap albums of all time.......had it been released in 1995. <br /> <br />First off, the production is solid, but since Erick Sermon is the principal producer, solid isn't good enough. The result of that is that Meth and Red give solid rhyming performances, which is good enough for lesser rappers, but not for them. Are these the same guys who rapped on classics like \\"36 Chambers\\", Whut ? Thee Album\\", \\"Tical\\", and \\"Dare Is A Darkiside\\"? I don't think so. They passed their peak as skillful lyricists in the mid-90's East Coast resurgence,but it hasn't dawned on them yet, I guess.
B0006B2A42|4.0|Released in 1968, \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" remains an engrossing, suspenseful thriller, well directed by John Sturges. With films like \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"The Great Escape\\" to his credit, you know that any movie directed by Mr. Sturges is going to hold your attention, even if--in this case--it clocks in at over two and a half hours.    The titular station is a weather outpost located close to the North Pole. Something has gone terribly wrong there, and an American nuclear submarine is sent on an urgent rescue mission. Nasty Arctic weather--and the polar ice cap--will not allow any other means of transport to reach \\"Zebra\\". Of course, there is a more sinister agenda here than trying to save the lives of a few stranded scientists. This is why the submarine has two espionage \\"experts\\" on board--one British and one Russian--as well as a platoon of marines.    Rock Hudson stars as the sub captain. While this role does not challenge Mr. Hudson's acting abilities, he is appropriately fearless and stalwart in the face of danger. Ernest Borgnine is our Russian secret service agent, working for the \\"West\\" as a \\"good Russian\\"--or is he ? Mr. Borgnine is a good actor, and after the first few scenes, I found myself accepting him in this role. Jim Brown is the tough-as-nails marine leader. I would never call him a great actor, but Mr. Brown is certainly convincing as someone nobody wants to annoy ! Real acting honours in this movie go to Patrick McGoohan as the British \\"agent\\". Fondly remembered for his sixties TV series \\"Danger Man\\" ( aka Secret Agent ) and \\"The Prisoner\\", it will always be a mystery to me why Mr. McGoohan did not choose to make a greater number of films and become a huge star. Frankly, for me at least, he steals the film.    The colour, widescreen picture is excellent, as is the sound for a 36-year old film. While some of the arctic action clearly takes place in the studio, I was impressed with the submarine footage, and once you are under the ice cap, youcan really feel the tension. Yes--it's a submarine film--things do indeed \\"go wrong\\" !    Ladies--while my wife did enjoy \\"Ice Station Zebra\\", she did confirm that this is a \\"guy movie\\" ! In fact, there are no women in the cast at all. If you are looking for romance, this is not the place !    It is not clear to me why Howard Hughes would want to watch this film hundreds of times, but is it a coincidence that this DVD starts with a trailer for \\"The Aviator\\" ? I don't think so.  The disc includes a few other trailers, and an interesting short on one of \\"Zebra's\\" cameramen who helped to pioneer action film photography--fascinating.    I suppose the West vs. Soviet \\"cold war\\" scenario is dated--in 2005, international tensions are much more complicated--but \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" still delivers a tense, exciting story, and this DVD was worth the wait. Recommended.    A very sad footnote, dated 15 January 2009--Mr. Patrick McGoohan has passed away--another fine actor has left us.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death by Iron Maidne is definitely a good album, I'm just a bit confused. <br /> <br />What's so great about Rainmaker? Why does everybody love this song? It's repetitive, poppy, and nothing sticks out. It's just a bad song.  <br /> <br />Same thing with Montgeur. Lots of people say this is really heavy. Yeah it is, for like the first 30 seconds. Then it goes to crap. I have every Maiden album, and this has got to be one of their worst songs. One reviewer said it was the heaviest Maiden song he's ever heard. This must be the only Maiden album he has then. Every song on Powerslave was heavier than this. I could seriously name atleast 60 Maiden songs heavier then that. <br /> <br />Anyways, those are my thoughts on Rainmaker(incredibly overarted), and Montsegur(just bad).  <br /> <br />The second half of this album compltely blows away the first half of it. The first half has Rainmaker and Montesegur. Enough said there. It also has Wildest Dreams, which isn't bad, but isn't great. I kinda like No More Lies, but it is nothing over the top. The title track is very good and is the best song at that point of the album, but it is later topped by songs from the second half. Geats of Tommorow has some good parts, but it's nothing too memorable. <br /> <br />But, then comes \\"New Frontier\\" and you know it's all good. I really enjoy this song. \\"New Frontier\\" is the first Iron Maiden song the drummer Nicko McBrain wrote or co-wrote. He should be involved a little more in the future, because this song is good. <br /> <br />Is there really any doubt that \\"Paschendale\\" is the best song on the album? I mean cmon, how good people like simple poppy Rainmaker better than this epic masterpiece? Some people say that this song can't get away from it's opening riff. Some people need to listen to this song again. It's called making a song people. It's like saying \\"Iron Maiden\\"(the song) is bad because it's too simple and uses the same riff over and oiver again. It's called writinga song people. If they didn't play that riff more than once, you same people would complain that the song has no direction and is just a bunch of riffs. Now stop complaining, and enjoy this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Then comes \\"Face in the Sand\\" which I enjoy a lot. It's a very good song. The intro really builds up to the rest of the song well, and that's the why I like it so much. I like songs that have awesome buildup, like \\"Moonchild\\"(from the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" album). <br /> <br />Then comes \\"Age of Innocence\\" and it's another good song, in my opinion. I like the chorus, and the lyrics even if they may seem a bit cheesy. Through the cheesiness you understand what they are going for and you can connect with it. Very good song, very enjoyable. <br /> <br />Then comes the great slower finale \\"Journeyman\\". It's seriosuly one of the best songs on the album. It's got one of those great buildups that just leads up to a great song. Bruce really shines on this one. I'd say it's his best song singing-wise on this album. Great chorus. <br /> <br />Overall, there is a lot of Iron Maiden albums that are better than \\"Dance of Death\\". But cmon, it's Iron Maiden. Which means you need to get this.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I picked up this album after hearing the song \\"Natural Blues\\" on the radio. For some reason, I set it aside, but I have just recently come back to it, and have found out just how amazing this album is. From start to finish, there is a variety of musical genres that allow any listener to be entertained. While I prefer the soft instrumental songs like \\"Guitar Flute and String,\\" \\"Everloving,\\" and \\"My Weakness,\\" other tracks, such as \\"Porcelain\\" and \\"Natural Blues\\" stand out as masterpieces. These five songs alone are reason enough for anybody to buy this album, but it doesn't end there. The only song I don't like from this album is \\"Machete\\", which seems to be too high-tempo for the rest of the album. Other standout songs for me include \\"Inside,\\" \\"Run On,\\" and \\"The Sky is Broken.\\" Every song on this album (save perhaps Machete) is revolutionary in that it defies classification into one genre. This is an album that everybody can enjoy.  <br /> <br />BEST SONGS: \\"Everloving,\\" \\"My Weakness,\\" \\"Guitar Flute and String,\\" and \\"Natural Blues.\\" <br /> <br />SONGS TO SKIP: \\"Machete\\" <br /> <br />I give this album 5 stars because I can listen to it no matter what kind of music I feel like hearing, and because there is only one song that I really ever skip. Belongs in every collection!
0345472640|5.0|First, let's look at what this book is not: It is not beautifully written, it is not the story of one person's experience and it is not dedicated to character building.  If you are looking for those things, then look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Now if you are looking for the smell, the horror, the courage and the sacrifice of the battlefield, then you will find it in this work.  Moore and Galloway have written a book that will serve as a textbook for generations of people who want to know what war is really like in a very objective manner - the heroism, the great leadership, poor leadership, mistakes, and occasional cowardice.  It pulls no punches and takes people and organizations to task where appropriate.  It is truly an amazing work and one that should be read by anyone when a debate on going to war is raging. <br /> <br />The book is in three distinctive parts:  The fight on Landing Zone X-Ray; The Fight on Landing Zone Albany; and the aftermath of the battles, for both the US involvement in Viet Nam and some of the families affected by it.  Moore was the Battalion Commander at X-Ray and gives a very good view of the decisions he made and why he made them.  He is able to walk us through the battle and describe the critical actions by both the North Vietnamese and the US forces that turned the tide of this battle and allowed Moore's force to win a victory.  There are many first person accounts of different aspects of the battle given by the US soldiers that fought there and also by some of the key North Vietnam leaders. <br /> <br />The second part of the book was about the relief battalion's retrograde back from LZ X-Ray to LZ Albany.  Moore was not here so all of the reporting was done thru interviews after the fact.  He is pretty scathing in some of his assesments of the decisions being made - although if you do not have military experience you might not find the writing scathing enough for what happened.  He describes the complecency by some of the leadership onthe movement back, the failure to set out decent security and the indecisiveness in the early moments of the battle.  He also points out the slow flow of information from Albany to the higher levels of the US Forces.  Albany was fought to a draw with horrendous losses on both sides after a North Vietnamese battalion and the 2/7 Cav had a meeting engagement (which means they ran into eachother in the woods).  One lead company was almost completely slaughtered, save a few people that had to do an E&E (Escape and Evasion) in order to get to safety.  The book contains three accounts of men that did that. <br /> <br />The final part of the book looked at the political decisions made in the aftermath of the war using declassified top secret memos written by Sec McNamara to illustrate that he knew very early in the war that it could prove to be unwinnable, putting the odds at a US victory at no better than 1 in 2.  Also, there are personal accounts from the widows and the children of some of the men that died in the battles.  Since I am in Iraq right now with the Army, and I have a two year old daughter, I found these passages particularily moving. <br /> <br />My only gripe with this book, is that your understaning of it is assisted greatly if you have been in the military.  Since I am, it is no problem, but for someone walking in with no experience, a lot of the terminology used and the prose itself will make following the story a little more difficult.  It reads almost exactly like an After Action Review, which probably is the proper voice for this piece, but some readers will have problems with it - as evidenced by some of the earlier reviews. <br /> <br />The bottom line - very honest, interesting, work.  It will help the reader understand battle, and perhaps understand it a little more than they would like to.  Highly recommend. <br />
B00000K0T8|4.0|The Wu striked again in 1996 with another unforgettable effort. After many listens trying to absorb it all, this album is actually about a 4.5 star effort. \\"Ironman\\" is quite a different album than other Wu-Tang classics like \\"Liquid Swords\\" and \\"Enter the 36 Chambers.\\" Ghostface may be the headliner, but Raekwon is all over this, and Cappadonna appears many times as well. Rza rhymes on a couple tracks and almost all the other Wu members make appearances (Gza sat this one out). I didn't like this CD much during the first spin-through, but the same can be said for \\"Liquid Swords,\\" and you HAVE TO keep listening to Wu albums to even attempt to catch the brilliance going on. <br />\\"Ironman\\" welcomed some 'lighter' vibes into the Wu's catalog. Not that the lyrics were lighter or any less hardcore, just some of the beats. Yes, the soul samples were introduced here, and done effortlessly and smoothly if you ask me. There were a couple tracks that showed bitterness towards women or even a specific woman like \\"Wildflower\\" and \\"Marvel.\\" Then women are portrayed in a positive light on the slow, sultry \\"Camay.\\" Ghost wasn't afraid to get heartfelt and unabashedly sentimental on \\"All I Got Is You\\"(w/ Mary J. Blige). This album's got a whole lotta different vibes going on. They didn't forget to include some of their signature grimey, hardcore joints, in case you're worried. <br />My favorites on this album are the upbeat \\"Iron Maiden,\\" \\"Fish,\\" \\"Daytona 500,\\" \\"Black Jesus,\\" and \\"After The Smoke Is Clear.\\" \\"Fish\\" is the only beat not done by Rza, and I love the beat here and the track overall! \\"Daytona 500\\" has some cool singing at the beginning and for the chorus. I'm not sure why they called it \\"Black Jesus,\\" but it has a holy beat (think \\"Gold\\") that would make Jesus himself proud. LOL! Posse cuts like \\"Assassination Day\\" and \\"Winter Warz\\" are excellent as well. There's not really one song that I can complain about on this CD, not even the explicit \\"Wildflower\\" or \\"Marvel.\\" <br/>Rza displays his masterful production touch again on this album, even as he was trying many new things. Ghostface's lyrics may be tough to penetrate and comprehend (I wonder if he even understands what he's saying), but it's his hype flow and energy that deserve recognition. Plus, it doesn't hurt that he got help from many of the other talented Wu-members. Every once in a while you will catch a great line from Ghost though, such as \\"slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph.\\" Ghosface may actually have some profound undertones with all the rhymes he's spittin' here. This was a very good album, I ended up liking it a lot. Check it out!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Episode 3.03 The Haunted Leg... I laugh just *thinking* about the dialogue in this episode. Season three was a fantastic season for the Gilmore Girls. The relationships had matured, Rory is growing up, and Lorelai is coming to terms with old demons and desires. Obviously I haven't seen this set yet as it's not out, but I've seen all of season three more than once and will still go buy this as soon as it comes out!
B00009V8Z9|4.0|On his J Records debut, Gavin DeGraw does not disappoint.  He's a talented singer and songwriter.  His style and charisma fits well in the contemporary music scene.  It's a shame that DeGraw was largely overlooked until the inclusion of \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" on the One Tree Hill television series soundtrack. <br /> <br />Originally released in 2003, Chariot showcases DeGraw's ability to transform lyrics into musically imagery and inspire emotion among fans and radio listeners alike.  From start to finish, the 11 tracks contained on Chariot are exceptional.  Stand out selections include \\"Follow Through,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Be,\\" \\"Chariot,\\" and \\"Just Friends.\\" <br /> <br />Check out Gavin DeGraw on tour.  He's even more brilliant live. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Gavin DeGraw, you may also like Jason Mraz and John Mayer.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I discovered this album late, so it's interesting to now read the various reviews from Amazon members.  The vast majority love it for being so unique, refreshing, uplifting, insightful, tragic, emotional and downright inspiring.  My rating of 5 stars confirms that I'm a member of that majority.    Although I certainly respect contrary opinions (the eye of the beholder), it's amazing to me that so many people have slagged this album simply because of the \\"obvious\\" influences with insinuations of mere copying and pasting.  Every musician from Bowie to Jeff Buckley to Radiohead to Lou Reed is quoted as an influence. Basically, just about every significant musical act of the last 30 years.  In response to that, I say....so what?    Name a musician working today who hasn't been influenced by the past?  In fact, I challenge you to name a musician who is considered to be an \\"innovator\\" of music (i.e. Chuck Berry, Rolling Stones, Beatles, etc.) who wasn't in some way influenced by Mozart or Beethoven, whether they knew it or not.    What I'm getting at here is that it shouldn't matter if you hear the sounds of older music in the music of today.  To some degree it has to be expected - either as an ode to the greats of yesterday or as an unintentional inspiration.    As for Arcade Fire, do you honestly think they sat around and consciously mapped out a plan to take pieces of all the greats with hopes of hitting the big time?  It sounds ridiculous just writing it.  I suspect these guys are naturally gifted musicians with their own inspirations and they came up with this beautiful music on their own.    Enjoy it for what it is.  In an age of over-synthed, heartless music with no soul, this shines through like a beacon of hope.    A true sign of a great album is that it gets better with every listen.  This album does so for me, and for those of you out there who have yet to buy the album, I encourage you to do so in the hope that you will experience the same.    Rock on.    ebhp==    UPDATE (6/26/05)    I had to post an update to this review, having just seen The Arcade Fire perform at the Hollywood Bowl.  Opening for the legendary David Byrne, they simply blew the roof off the place, which is a good thing since there isn't a roof on the Bowl.  I have to hand it to David Byrne for signing this band up, because he had a hard time matching the energy they created in the sold-out performance with 18,000+ screaming fans.  He could have signed up a marginal band that would have made him look that much better, but instead he exposed this magical band to all of Los Angeles.    The Arcade Fire consist of a nine person band, but that wasn't enough.  They had to bring on 6 additional violinists/cellists to create the symphonic wall of sound captured on this amazing album.  Some bands try to be weird just to be weird, and at times I thought they were heading down the same road.  Case in point - at one moment of the show two band members wearing gold/black motorcyle helmets from the 70's were wrestling each other on the stage, hitting each other with drumsticks.  This could have detracted from the music, but to our surprise it didn't.  Seeing this band live is like watching a carnival of freaks setting themselves on fire at the expense of entertaining the crowd, but when it's all said and done they walk away unharmed, having left behind a mass of people simply amazed at the beauty and sheer power of their music.  This band rocks.    ebhp
B000001EGE|3.0|Most paid critics have hailed this as Elton's finest album.  They say it has more HOOKS, as if that were really all a great album needed.  I can't place Honky Chateau in his pantheon of greats--and I'll explain why Tumbleweed Connection is a better choice.  First, the good news: the best song here is \\"Rocket Man\\".  Our ears may not hear it anymore, but this song shows how clever Elton was at infusing pop with classical elements (non-pop verse lengthening, chords you'll never hear from anyone else on the radio), but makes them sound totally organic.  What a gift!  \\"Honky Cat\\" is one of his most assured vocal/piano performances; after this and \\"Mellow\\", Elton would never again sing with such wild-yet-true abandon (maybe due to the ensuing production glitz).  And, speaking of production, we gladly can't hear much of Paul Buckmaster's hand--he ruined many a great Elton song before and after with overreaching orchestrations.  This may be the most tasteful Elton album as far as instrumentation/arrangements goes--wish they all had this as the model.  It's a trade off with second-rate songs.    A word here about Mr. Taupin's words: those who revere \\"Honky Cat\\" and it's wry self-exposure need to hear about a dozen songs Mr. Ray Davies wrote on the subject (nearly all better than this lyric). The rustic/urban battle had been done before. I continue to smile and scratch the head at all the Taupin adulation out there.  Elton was great IN SPITE OF HIM!    Critics also say that Elton's albums usually have a unifying \\"groove\\" to them.  I agree, as Chateau has a Boogie-Woogie/Ragtime/Nawlins vibe. Soon he would tack on Bubblegum to that list for the Don't Shoot Me... album.  So the critics like the wry wink of it all, I guess, but I much prefer the vibe of Tumbleweed Connection, which is Gospel/Delta Blues/Appalachian-American Roots. Tumbleweed also had a better band (even though they're a grab bag of sessionmen, but still  better than Johnstone/Murray/Olsson). And, aside from thelovely \\"Mona Lisa...\\", much of the second half of Chateau is second-rate.  \\"Hercules\\" was to become a better tune when heard as \\"Teacher I Need You\\" on Don't Shoot Me...  And am I the only one who hears \\"Amy\\" as basically the same song as \\"Honky Cat?\\"  Some of the piano licks are lifted note-for-note. Written in 5 days, a reviewer here says--well, when you start repeating yourself within the same album, it's time to work longer and come up with something new. This just can't be the finest album of Elton's, but Tumbleweed just may be.
B00078XKDE|5.0|So a guy and a girl want to make music and they get slammed for ripping off White Stripes.  Come on.<br /><br />I am enjoying this CD more than about any this year.  Her voice is odd and compelling and compliments the jagged, hard driving minimalistic guitar work like nothing I've heard in awhile.<br /><br />I don't care if they use drum machines.  They do it better and more creatively than REM did it when their drummer called it quits.  Drummers are probably hard to find and then you have to pay them and haul around all their equipment.  (Besides if I had a lead singer that looked like her I would say, \\"No, no.  We don't need anybody else.  Not even a roadie.  Just, ah, you and me, wink, okay?\\"<br /><br />Seriously though.  This is a great album from a band that hopefully will keep cranking it out.  Jack White may have called attention to this raw, garage-like approach to music but a group like the Kills are extending this approach in their own unique direction.<br /><br />It's refreshing, the lyrics are clever and interesting, and it has a hard-rocking, bluesy edge to it that makes for many and many quality listens.<br /><br />(And yeah, she sounds like PJ Harvey.  I have no problem with that.  Hey we are what we eat.  That's better than sounding like Stevie Nicks)<br /><br />Author of:<br />[[ASIN:1931982945 A Bottle of Rain]]<br />[[ASIN:1930008015 Nowhere Near the Sea of Cortez]]
B00006IUNN|5.0|\\"Windtalkers\\" opens with glorious scenes of Monument Valley. This is the land of the Navaho. From glorious the scene changes to gory. Joe Enders' (Nicolas Cage) unit is cut to pieces on a Japanese island. Enders alone survives. He's wounded while all 15 men with him died... \\"on the ascent of nowhere.\\"<br /><br />After rehabilitation, Enders' next job in the Marines is guard a Navaho code talker named Ben Yahzee. Yet his job is not to protect the code talker but the code. This makes Enders adopt an attitude. \\"Don't get too close, \\" Enders says to his friend Anderson. \\"What the hell's the matter with you?\\" comes the reply.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, Enders will change and so will the viewer. I hope I have not given too much away by the title of this review. Great scenery. Great drama. Great movie.
044024157X|4.0|With Grisham's latest works he has clearly attempted to get away from the legalistic style that defined his first dozen novels. <br />As a Grisham reader since the age of about 10(I'm, currently 21) <br />I had long since become fed up with his works by age 18. <br />However, with that said this is by far his best \\"hybrid work\\", in which he intertwines some legitimate aspects of the law with an endearing town and colorful people. We all noticed the change in JG's style around the time of \\"The Testament\\" and I feel it was an entirely necessary one. <br /> <br />While this novel is chronological it is anything but typical. The main characters accounts on many different subjects shows how he literally matures from 23 at the beginning of the novel to his early 30's at the end. The subject matter was diverse and at some point I wondered if it all kept the plot tightly together, but after finishing it I realized that JG's aim was certainly not to write a simple formulaic suspense plot. Instead, he provided us with insights into the changes in the south regarding race relations, urbanization, school desegration, the press and primarily acts (an act) of (criminal) justice in a small town. <br /> <br />The Ruffin family is indeed a remarkable one and many of other characters will be familar to fellow Grisham fanatics. While Grisham has changed a lot in the past 15 years, he still maintains an ability to force us to empathize, ponder and think unlike few authors of our generation.
B00013RC9I|5.0|There is something quite dreamy, ethereal, and indeed blissful in the music of Air, and in particular on this, their third album. Whether as soothing, quiet background for working or relaxing, or as something to be turned up loud, the electronic mood music of Talkie Walkie makes for wonderful listening. Give it a listen, and it will bring you joy and make you feel like you are slowly floating within the most beautiful garden in the world.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|My god, I don't know where to start! I love this band and I'm so exctied to see them at the Gorge in May! <br /> <br />1. Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) - One of the best songs on the album. Rarely am I hooked on an album on the very first listen, but this song hooked me. <br /> <br />2. Neighborhood #2 (Laika) - It was so cool so see this song on Conan a couple months ago. Not as brilliant as neightborhood #1, but still a stunning song. <br /> <br />3. Une Annee Sans Lumiere - Nice little break in between the epic Neighbordoods. Builds and builds and ends up being pretty cool at the end. <br /> <br />4. Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) - I hear this one on the radio all the time. Maybe they'll release it as a single? please? <br /> <br />5. Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) - Very very beautiful. Pretty much the opposite of neighborhod 3. A very heart-wrenching, slow, sad song. <br /> <br />6. Crown of Love - I still can't get this one out of me head! All around great song. Normal enough for almost everyone to love it. <br /> <br />7. Wake up - !!!!!!! My god, that sound! Stunning! Mind-blowingly beautiful song. <br /> <br />8. Haiti - Different feel, with a female lead singer. Still a great song. I prefer the male singer, though. <br /> <br />9. Rebellion (Lies) - Best song on the album HANDS DOWN. Glad they chose this song for the first video. Highlight and climax of the entire album! <br /> <br />10. In the backseat - Lovely closer. Starts out kind of...meh, but it builds and really starts to grow on you. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this band is not \\"over-hyped\\" at all. It's well respected, but it doesn't get a tenth of the coverage that Greenday (ugh), U2, Linkin Park (puke), and other popular bands get. Give this album a shot and decide for yourself if it deserves the hype.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I was as excited as anyone to finally get the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, but I must say that Mr. Lucas should be held accountable for the crime of ruining it.  Let's all be honest...the new Star Wars movies (Attack of the Clones etc..) are okay, but if they did not have the Star Wars name attached to them, they would not even be worth a mention.  So, why do we have to see them interposed into the originals.  First, Boba Fett used to be cool, but his new voice (that of the gentleman in the new movies) is so distracting I found myself screaming in frustration....nothing, however, could top the replacement of the Anakin Skywalker's ghost at the end of Jedi by Hayden Christiansen (sp?)'s likeness.  It is an utter travesty.  If I were Luke Skywalker, and had just seen my Father die, and then seen this image, I would wonder who the heck this young dude was?  I think Mr. Lucas should remember that these films are for us,the fans..if he wants to experiment he should do it on his home copy, not on the copy that we all have to own.  What I wouldn't give for the original releases on DVD.

I think they're heading in the right direction with this CD, however, for some reason, I felt like \\"Does This Look Infected?\\" felt more addicting.

0743454529|5.0|Anna Fitzgerald has been through countless medical procedures, but she's not sick. She was conceived as the perfect donor for her older sister, Kate, who was diagnosed with leukemia at age 3. Neither of Kate's parents or her older brother were close enough matches to be a marrow donor. Anna was the perfect donor, and her umbilical cord blood saved her sister's life for the first time. Kate went into remission for 5 years, and the family was peaceful and happy. Then Kate relapsed and needed more treatments. Anna was the donor each time that Kate needed help; but now at age 13, Anna has rebelled for the right to have a choice in whether her body parts are removed to save Kate. Kate now needs a kidney transplant, which is far more dangerous to Anna that any of the earlier medical procedures she has had to endure.<br /><br />Sara and Brian are the loving parents of Kate and Anna, and their older brother, Jesse, who, to say the least, is a troubled kid. The book is told from the perspective of each of these characters, as well as the lawyer that Anna retained to represent her in the medical emancipation case and the court-appointed guardian ad litum. Each chapter is told from a different perspective, which allows the author to thoroughly explore the impact of Kate's illness on each of the characters.<br /><br />The author has tremendous insight into both the physical and emotional trauma suffered by each member of the family. Their family life has largely been centered around Kate's needs, which has obviously had repercussions on the other two children. As a parent, I had great empathy with the challenges faced by the parents. Brian said \\"parenting is really just a matter of tracking, of hoping your kids do not get so far ahead you can no longer see their next moves.\\" In a later chapter he said \\"They outgrow us so much faster than we outgrown them.\\"<br /><br />The book covers the full gamut of emotions - there are some really funny scenes, some very sad ones, some more hopeful, some uplifting. The moral, legal and ethical issues are very thought provoking. The thought of parenting such a sick child is frightening, but the fundamental message is that we each have the capacity to adapt and change and play the hand we are dealt with.opeful, some uplifting.

0312983867|4.0|HARD EIGHT by Janet Evanovich <br />March 13, 2005  <br /> <br />Rating 4/5 stars <br /> <br />Here is another fun romp of a story featuring bounty hunter Stephanie Plum.  In Janet Evanovich's HARD EIGHT, Stephanie is still toying with the idea of having sex with Ranger (that awesome hunk of a bounty hunter that all women drool over) but she's also wondering what is up with Morelli, her \\"true love\\".  He hasn't called in a while, and she thinks she misses him. She's also helping out a neighbor of her parents', Mabel, whose daughter is missing and is asked to find her as a favor. This leads Stephanie into all sorts of trouble, and as usual her vehicles catch on fire (I think we count 3 in this novel, maybe 4). She's being chased down by the Easter Bunny, and masked men dressed up as Bill Clinton and Nixon. Only Stephanie can survive it all! As usual, I'm' recommending this one. It is always fun to return to one of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books!
6305161879|4.0|John Cleese, of Monty Python fame, co-wrote the screenplay for this hilarious comedy caper along with director Charles Crichton, who also directed \\"The Lavender Hill Mob.\\" Cleese is totally irreverent and has absolutely no clue as to the meaning of political correctness. Everyone and everything is a target for satire. Cleese also performs here one of the most side-splitting stripteases I have ever seen. I literally doubled-over with laughter!<br /><br />A  twenty million dollar jewelry heist is pulled off in London's Hatton Gardens by four eccentric misfits, two Brits and two Americans. George (Tom Georgeson) is the ringleader, the man who masterminded the theft. He is the only one who knows where the jewels are hidden. His partners in crime include animal lover, Ken Pile, (Michael Palin), a socially inept bumbler with a stuttering problem. He loves his goldfish, Wanda, (named for the movie's heroine), with the passion most attach to their significant other. Wanda Gershwitz, (Jamie Lee Curtis), is George's girlfriend, who uses her formidable seduction techniques to get what she wants, and she wants all the money! Wanda finagles to bring Otto West, (Kevin Kline), into the gang, telling the others he is her brother - although like most other men in the film, he is her lover. And Kline is brilliant as the manic, Nietzche-reading, ex-CIA agent and Anglophobe. He is a self-styled intellectual, but is so stupid that he thinks the London Underground is a political movement. As Wanda remarks, \\"He's so dumb he thought the Gettysburg Address was where Lincoln lived.\\"<br /><br />The ploys, dirty tricks and double-crosses Otto and Wanda use against their partners, to prevent their receiving a share of the loot, are classic. When George's lawyer, Archie, (John Cleese), falls in love with Wanda, her formidable skills at juggling men are seriously challenged. Cleese brings an endearing romantic touch to the smitten Archie. The situation grows more and more convoluted and the laughs build right along with the escalation. Otto is extremely jealous of any man who looks twice at Wanda, and obviously Archie takes more than two glimpses. Madcap madness!<br /><br />I don't want to disclose any more of the plot here, but \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" contains some of the funniest scenes I have viewed on film. Director Charles Crichton keeps the pace moving at a nice clip and the satire involving the cultural clash between the very proper, if somewhat stuffy English, versus the uncouth, aggressive Yanks is pure delight. At one point, Archie says to Wanda: \\"Do you have any idea what it's like to be English? We're all terrified by embarrassment. That's why we're all dead!\\"<br /><br />This flaky farce is a must see! A definite 5 star film, I am rating this only 4 stars, however, because of the poor quality of the DVD. I advise renting the movie and waiting for the re-release before buying this comic masterpiece.<br /><br />JANA.e laughs build right along with the escalation.

0792165020|5.0|Anthony Minghella's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is a gorgeously filmed experience, bringing to life Patricia Highsmith's acclaimed novel.  Although it was Jude Law who got an Oscar nomination, the movie wouldn't work at all without the incredibly gifted Matt Damon.  Damon's Tom Ripley is a cornucopia of emotions, both likeable and despicable.  His desire to become Dickie is rooted in a miserable sense of self-loathing, and an opportunistic personality evidenced early on in his uncanny ability to imitate other people's voices and also their handwriting.  Law does a very good job as Dickie, showing us his shallow side, his awe with Ripley and eventually his jealousy and boredom.  Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Dickie's \\"woman\\" or plaything, and gets to show a great range in her emotional makeup.  Cate Blanchett is as always wonderful, but not given a whole lot to do; Jack Davenport who was so good in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" does a fine job as Peter, the one person who truly loves Tom, and suffers for this love.<br /><br />THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is indeed a \\"dark\\" film, and one cannot condone Ripley's actions.  Damon is so good, however, that by the end of the movie, we have a sense of compassion for him, in spite of what he's done.  Handsomely capturing the mood of 1950's Italy, replete with a wonderful score and cinematography, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is an exceptionally well done thriller.
B0007P3582|4.0|50's new album is awesome but some songs arent as noticable as others.

The Documentary is still my choice for album of the year. Get Rich Or Die Trying was still better than this one. but regardless of whether The Massacres bad or good it will sell and probably break the record sales of Get Rich or Die Trying.

B0001CCXY8|5.0|Up until I heard 'The Wretched Spawn', I was convinced that 'Bloodthirst' was Cannibal's best album. If anything, 'Wretched' is the album they should have made after 'Bloodthirst;' but the band released a safe album 'Gore Obsessed' in between both albums. 'The Wretched Spawn' takes the intensity of 'Bloodthirst' but adds more diversity in it's sound {hell they even have a what I call a \\"death metal ballad\\" w/ the song \\"Festering in the Crypt;\\" which happens to be my favorite track!) This is definitely the Corpse's best & most brutal work to date!! This one will be hard for the band to beat!!
0671799320|5.0|This book is basically a history of the oil industry, from the first discoveries and uses in Pennsylvania in the 1800's to the present. The book shows how oil influenced world events like World War II and the Suez Canal crisis. In addition, it shows how the major oil companies like Shell, Exxon, and Texaco came about and how they negotiated (and most of the time abused) the host countries. The best part about the book was its global perspective as it covers all of the major oil producing areas from South America to Azerbaijan to the the Far East, and of course the Middle East. If you are looking for one good book about oil, then this is the one for you. Enjoy. I know I did.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I'll admit it right off the bat, I hate George W. Bush, and I want to smack every person who celebrates his're-election'. When Dubbya 'won' I needed something, I needed something that I had never had before. That was American Idiot, I needed a very specific song to vent my own outrage to, and that was Holiday.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a Green Day fan, I never liked their music, as fellow rebellious teens shoved their music in my face, I only felt annoyed. I didn't like the aftershock-punk that echoed in their music, much more immature and indirect than their so-called forefathers. I ignored their Good Riddance inspired radio swagger; I didn't hear American Idiot, the single, until many weeks after its release.<br /><br />When I listened to American Idiot, I instantly felt that outrage which died with the rise and fall of nu-metal phad Papa Roach, that outrage I thought died with Disturbed's freshman debut The Sickness, the outrage now popped out and overdone by nu-metal late comers Linkin Park. That very same outrage which blazed forth from the fathers of the thought-to-be-dead Punk Rock genre I found in American Idiot.<br /><br />I have to say, the people who're going to hate this album are Right Wingers, and those \\"Punk\\" rock fans in their teens that were devout Green Day fans from the start, some fans are going to love this for it harkening back to the days of blatant outrage. Some on the other hand, aren't going to find it simplistic enough, nor directed at parents enough, or too directed, and will probably end up sticking with any number of vanilla Punk-Pop bands.<br /><br />I haven't heard a Rock Opera in many years, but that is essentially what American Idiot, the album, is, it's a politically outraged Rock Opera, the rarest kind in Americas corporate run music industry. Jesus of Suburbia is one big song, and it rocks and styles with a kind of confidence and irony I never got to miss in current music, because it wasn't there. I'm going to cop out and give a per-track score for the sake of space.<br /><br />American Idiot 4/5<br />Jesus Of Suburbia 5/5<br />Holiday 5/5<br />Boulevard Of Broken Dreams 1/5 - (I Really, Really, don't like this song.)<br />Are We The Waiting 3/5<br />St. Jimmy 4/5 - (4, for the vocals that bring the song to a close.)<br />Give Me Novocaine 5/5(Great song to drift to when feeling numb, prettiest song on the album.)<br />She's A Rebel 1.5/5 (Outright boring in my opinion.)<br />Extraordinary Girl 3/5<br />Letterbomb 3.5/5<br />Wake Me Up When September Ends 4/5 (My friend effin' loves this song.)<br />Homecoming 4.5/5 (The ending is a big cop out.)<br />Whatsername 4/5 (A kind of longing to this song, I like it.)<br /><br />I love the story it tells, it's an interesting plot, ending pretty harshly, the choruses are more harmonic, which is probably why they're being called sell-outs, Green Day probably are selling out, they've created a very strange image for themselves, I question what their next album could possibly sound like after all of the press on American Idiot.

1400043662|5.0|I've been going through as many reviews of this novel as I can find. None of them take this book as seriously as I do, for one reason or another. I believe that Kafka on the Shore deserves serious attention. John Updike's in the New Yorker conveys the same basic view of the theme that I would like to, presenting it as a novel about existence in general. Other reviews complain about loose ends, but acknowledge the novel's force with phrases like \\"sheer narrative punch.\\" To me, though, Murakami pulled it off perfectly. In this novel, Murakami takes the courageous step of writing a book that is manifestly about the psyche. Some of its characters and conceits come directly out of Jungian psychology. It becomes a novel about integration of conciousness, and about how to live in an era that is to an extent aware of its own psyche. This is probably the most exciting book I've read from the last decade. It is also a lot of fun, and terribly beautiful in places. It moves through its surreal action with an admirable serenity. The writing is lucid, the dialogue memorable. Kafka on the Shore deserves to be read closely and remembered dearly.

0553582461|4.0|Hobb is one of the most engaging fantasy writers to have emerged in the last ten years. I have been addicted to the story of FitzChivalry since he appeared in Assassin's Apprentice and have bought and devoured these books literally as quickly as they have appeared. It was certainly with mixed emotions that I picked up this last book. Mixed, because while I wanted to read it, I also did not really want the story of FitzChivalry to end.<br /><br />Let me first say that Fool's Fate is a worthy entry in the series. It kept me reading and absorbed all the way through. There were times when the pages literally could not turn fast enough to satisfy my need to see what would happen next. Do not be afraid of being disappointed.<br /><br />That said, I (like many reviewers here, I see) felt that the book finally failed at closing the story of the life of FitzChivalry in a manner that kept it in sync with the history of the Six Duchies. The book, to me, far too easily closed down aspects like Fitz and his Wit, the fate of the Fool, and the future of Nettle.<br /><br />I think that I understand how Hobb wanted to end this book. I wanted that ending as a reader also. However, I felt that in order to get to that ending she sacrificed too many things that were both good and real in the life of Fitz.<br /><br />For potential readers: Do not begin with the Tawny Man trilogy-- begin with the Farseer Trilogy. You will miss too much if you start with these three books.<br /><br />For Robin Hobb: Please write more as quickly as possible!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Before I start my review, let me state that I did manage to see this film subtitled at an art museum in New York.  For me, it was a very interesting experience to discover Miyazaki in his youngest days.  While some may find the quality of this film to be a bit dated upon initial glance, it is important to remember that NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND was made back in 1984, so the animation, likewise, does not have as much polish as Miyazaki's later work displays. But this is not to say that NAUSICAA is unwatchable because of that. This is a deeply complex, imaginative tale set in a post-apocalyptic world that will remind many of PRINCESS MONONOKE, only the protagonist is a girl. Nausicaa is a compassionate princess who prefers to solve problems with peace, not vengeance. Her struggle to resolve a bitter conflict between two warring kingdoms and prevent them from reaching her home valley is not a good vs. evil tale. The characters are all flawed, believable people with their own agendas and redeeming qualities.<br /><br />In a testament to Miyazaki's admiration of nature, the film offers a sub-plot involving a supposedly poisonous jungle. The product of a terrible global war, this thick, lush forest not only showcases Miyazaki's imagination (those insects sure are creepy-looking!) but also emphasizes the dangers of world pollution.<br /><br />While NAUSICAA is an older movie from Miyazaki, it manages to hold surprisingly well--most classics have such staying power.<br /><br />Its long journey to America is a story in and of itself. In 1985 (a year after the film broke records in Japan), NAUSICAA debuted in America--renamed WARRIORS OF THE WIND, drastically altered, and cut by a quarter of its two-hour running time, much to the outrage of Miyazaki and his colleagues. Since that time, Miyazaki declared that any adaptations of his films for American release must be done under the supervision of his company, Studio Ghibli.<br /><br />As much as some folks love to hate Disney these days, one can credit them for taking the time to strike a deal with Miyazaki to distribute his films globally. While the Mouse House has made their share of marketing mistakes with his films, the dubs they've produced thus far--KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, PRINCESS MONONOKE, SPIRITED AWAY, and CASTLE IN THE SKY--all have maintained a quality of excellence and strong performances from a solid cast of well-known actors and actresses. This brand new English version of NAUSICAA is no exception.<br /><br />As the title character, Alison Lohman provides commendable sincerity, compassion, and vulnerability, and is amply supported by a grand cast of side characters, which include Uma Thurman (the embittered empress Kushana); Chris Sarandon (the sneaky, smarmy Kurotowa); Edward James Olmos (feisty, loyal Mito); and unexpected appearances by veteran character stalwarts Tress MacNeille, Jeff Bennett, Tony Jay (who does a brief opening voiceover), and the Little Mermaid herself, Jodi Benson. Shia LaBeouf's Asbel sounds a bit rocky at first, but he grew on me. Mark Hamill, fresh from his outstanding turn as the evil Muska on the brilliant yet underappreciated (on some places anyway) CASTLE IN THE SKY dub, plays a small role as the Mayor of Pejite. He only appears in two scenes, and consequently, his performance here isn't as remarkable as his work in CASTLE IN THE SKY, but it's nonetheless great to hear his golden voice in another Miyazaki dub. Arguably the highlight of this dub is Patrick Stewart as Nausicaa's mentor, Lord Yupa. He speaks with strong Shakespearian diction and carries the dub as a whole through his subtle, charismatic rendition of this skilled swordsman.<br /><br />Miyazaki declared that any new adaptation of his masterpiece should be nothing but a straight translation and no cuts. English dub scriptwriters Donald H. Hewitt and Cindy Davis Hewitt (who worked on Spirited Away) honor his wishes through their adaptation, remaining faithful to the story while tweaking a bit of terminology for comprehension purposes.<br /><br />As with Miyazaki's other works, Joe Hisaishi provides the music score. Compared to the more lush soundtracks he composed for Miyazaki's later films, his score for NAUSICAA, while undeniably beautiful, occasionally comes off as a tad primitive, notably when it breaks into sometimes jarring techno-synth jingles. For better or worse, his score remains intact in the new cut of NAUSICAA, which will no doubt please purists. I was a bit disappointed, however--especially when his ambitious reworking of the CASTLE IN THE SKY score (composed exclusively for that dub) turned out so well IMO. A film like this deserves a 5.1 remix! Nonetheless, it's my one quibble of this otherwise top-notch English track of Miyazaki's most revered masterpiece.<br /><br />The DVD sports a near flawless visual transfer and a humble serving of extras--which include the typical English voice talent featurette we saw on Disney's previous wave of Miyazaki's films, trailers and TV spots, and a second disc devoted entirely to storyboards. The most noteworthy feature on this disk is a 30-minute long documentary, \\"The Birth of Studio Ghibli\\", which is undistractingly dubbed into English. For fans that are curious about the upbringing of this animation studio and wondering which of their films have yet to be released, this is a must-see.<br /><br />As someone who has been very pleased with Disney's releases of Miyazaki's works so far, I am delighted to say that they have done yet another bang-up job on polishing this legendary classic for new generations to cherish. Don't be fooled by its primitive looks; NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND's status as a masterpiece resonates from the first minute to the last.ion purposes.

B000002UJQ|5.0|While I know it is becoming increasingly popular to pick on Radiohead (Some of their later works do deserve criticism), it doesn't change the fact that this is one of the best albums of the 90s and will go down as Radiohead's defining record, as well as one of my favorites.

B000002JSP|3.0|If you are a true Led Zeppelin fan you must buy all of their pre-1980 albums.  Most us us (of age) have owned all the LPs in both the album and CD formats (if not cassaette and 8-tracks too).  This LP was weak compared to the previous classics.  It is important because of the death of John Bonham shortly after its released (and with that the death of Led Zeppelin).  In spite of its weaknesses, this LP is well the price because of 4 superb classics: Fool In The Rain, All My Love, In The Evening, and Carouselambra.  Don't leave this one out of your Zeppelin collection. <br />ZOSO
B00005Y228|5.0|Stand-Outs: Love At First Sight / Can't Get You Out Of My Head / Fever / Fragile / Come Into My World / In Your Eyes  <br /> <br />This was the album that made me realized that Kylie was still around and made me become a bigger Kylie fan. I was a fan of her show in Australia \\"Neighbors\\" before she became a music artist when I used to live in England. I followed her first 3 albums then moved back to the states where she wasn't heard of till this album. Goes to show you what the American market was missing out after \\"Loco-motion\\".
0609610570|2.0|The authors bring up to the table a new perspective on the very critical issue of \\"Execution\\" in business. They also went one step further, developing a framework to improve the \\"art\\" of getting things done. The authors deserve credit for that. However, the book has no academic rigor and issues are discussed superficially. The constant references to GE and Jack Welch are tiring and often, the business cases state the obvious. Read it only if you have some spare hours and you want to know about the latest MBA-like framework.
B000696PWC|5.0|I must say this is the best compilation of all Kylie's compilation album. Disc 1 are for old school fans and that'd be me. Disc 2 are her current hits. Granted that it's missing some singles that I thought should be in here but I guess because they weren't that high in the charts they weren't added. I don't care much for compilation albums because I have all of Kylie's albums but I couldn't pass up on her 2 new tracks which are brilliant!
B000002G7E|5.0|if i could only have 1 velvet underground album [scary thought i know], this would be the one i'd choose. obviously more developed than their first release and more inspired than their two releases that followed WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT [this is not an insult to those other albums], lou reed and john cale destroy sonic boundaries w/ this album.  <br /> <br />\\"white light/white heat\\" - is a brilliant rocker that gets better w/ every listen. the lyrics are simple and vivid.  <br />\\"the gift\\" is a short story that reed wrote, and cale reads it over some nice background music - it's kind of a song.  <br />\\"lady g's operation\\" - has cale on the mic again, for the majority of the song at least. amazing riff - cale and reed's vocals work very well.  <br />\\"here she comes now\\" is as sweet as honey.  <br />\\"i heard her call my name\\" is, in my opinion, one of vu's 3 greatest songs. it rocks harder than any song they put out after or before it [with the exception of \\"sister ray\\"], and the lyrics and background vocals are haunting. it's beautiful and nasty and disturbing all at the same time.  <br />\\"sister ray\\" is one of the greatest songs ever recorded by anyone. vu's obvious best [imo]. it rocks harder than any song i've ever heard. the lyrics are brilliant. the changes keep you interested for the entire 17 1/2 minutes - the time goes by too fast.  <br /> <br />you don't know rock unless you've heard this album - it's that simple.
B000667GFK|5.0|Primero que nada, el Espaol es una lengua muy rica y hermosa, de la cual me siento muy orgulloso, ademas de poder decir que he nacido en un pais Latinoamericano tan bello como lo es Mexico y ser nativo parlante  de  ella. Luis Miguel es MEXICANO le pese a quien le pese y no puerto riqueo como dicen los medios o la gente ignorante y con este trabajo lo demuestra a TODOS  les guste o no. Siento que para poder mirar al Futuro, debemos  basarnos en el pasado y la musica no es ajena a esto por lo que el rescatar los origenes de la musica mexicana, y hacerlo de la mano de maestros de la cancion como lo son los  autores de los temasen los que canta, Luis Miguel demuestra que no solo es el tipico cantante de moda, sino demuestra su inteligencia musical al retomar temas tan importantes en nuestra cultura como los de su disco. Asi que mas que ser el cantante con canciones vacias, para mi y muchos mexicanos es una persona que  no ha tenido una vida facil (quien la ha tenido) pero demuestra la madurez a traves de su mayor don... su voz
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|Almond, the singer, is a drama queen, an insatiable sexual creature, a passionate philosopher of the seedier side of life, and a human wrought with angst. That combination is masterfully portrayed in this brutally honest exposure of himself.<br /><br />What makes Soft Cell so utterly unique is the aforementioned complemented with their poppy, synth-rock sound. Sure, \\"Tainted Love\\" is a great song, (especially the bonus track #11 of \\"Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go\\" mix); however, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is so much more than that song. I'm extremely fond of the song \\"Frustration.\\" It most certainly sets the tone for the rest of the CD. Let me not forget the darkness of \\"Sex Dwarf;\\" although I smile during this song, there is a uncomfortable element to it as well.<br /><br />I would have to include Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret in a top album of all time list.<br /><br />Soft Cell aptly demonstrates that synth-rock can have depth and rawness.
B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. is one damn cool album and Ten doesn't come near its greatness. Every song here is good. it's got it's fast, loud parts (Blood), its flat-out rockers (Go, Dissident), and its points of just plain excellence in every way (Rearviewmirror). <br /> <br />There's not too much to complain about this record! It even has something for fans of acoustic songs with Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town. It's a great point of 90s music. <br /> <br />INDIVIDUAL RATINGS: <br /> <br />Go-10/10 An awesome bass-laden rock song <br />Animal-9/10 Just great. <br />Daughter-9/10 Another great song about child abuse, but the songwriting isn't very good <br />Glorified G-9/10 A bit funky, with a great guitar riff and good lyrics <br />Dissident-10/10 Just straight out rock with nice lead guitar <br />W.M.A.-9/10 Phenomenal drumming, a slightly haunting song <br />Blood-6/10 The low point of the album, just Eddie screaming and cursing with no good lyrics and clumsy guitar going nowhere. Some people will like it, but I don't. <br />Rearviewmirror-10/10 Just perfect in every way possible. Some of Eddie's best songwriting and great guitar. <br />Rats-8/10 It's like Blood, only better, with great lyrics that most people don't like, comparing humans to rats. Eddie keeps screamin' away. <br />Elderly Woman-10/10 A gorgeous song about meeting a long-lost friend. One of my very favorites. <br />Leash-9/10 A thrilling song <br />Indifference-8.5/10 An unnatural PJ song, just buy this album and listen to it <br /> <br /> <br />There ya go. This is a phenomenal album, and if you're thinking about buying it, buy it now.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It's one of the few albums that I wouldn't have a problem with buying for someone as a gift, because I know the recipient would like it.  Musically it's very solid - diverse, well composed, and complex.  Lyrically it's great.<br /><br />If you like any indie music, you must own this album.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This was worth every penny. Mav and Lisa's vocals stand out the most to me. 15 Year old Chloe has a great clarity to her voice, but her voice can seem thin at times. Great traditional Irish music, and modern music. Mirad Nesbitt soars on fiddle just as she did in Maichael Flately's \\"Lord Of The Dance\\" and \\"Feet of Flames\\". I totally recommend you see the DVD and then get the CD for the music. If you are a fan of angelic voices and celtic music then you will not be disappointed.
0783225970|5.0|When director Brian De Palma completed a project called \\"Scarface\\", wrapped it up, and sent it to the Motion Picture Association of America, it got sent back, undeniably an X rating, claimed to be highly controversial and inappropriate, with its extreme violence and \\"harsher sexually derived language\\". De Palma and his crew spent countless hours in the editing room, cutting -what we now see as memorable- parts of the movie.  <br />Eventually, De Palma was incredulous about the film giving the same appeal to people if edited, and succeeded in persuading them to allow it to be viewed to the public, to which they reluctantly gave in. With an approved rating of \\"R\\", the frustrated De Palma returned back to the uncut, original version, and released it nationwide in late 1983, after two agonising years of production. <br />The epic is set just over three years ago, in 1980, as Cuban refugee hoodlum named Tony Montana rises to be one of the most prolific gangsters, and one of the biggest distributors of cocaine in the Miami cocaine empire. However, his overconfidence, desire for more, and lack of trust in anybody else apart from him leads to his untimely downfall, in which costs him dearly into a rousing climax. <br />With the New York Times calling it, \\"Stylish and Provocative\\", and Time Magazine hailing it at \\"Exhilarating\\", Scarface has definitely placed its mark in history, with its boldly imaginative display of polished style and captivating thriller, (well it was about damn time Hollywood gave us a rare and decent action thriller.) <br />Sure the plot may seem crude, as those who do not comprehend the art view this as a \\"good ol' fashioned drug gangster movie\\", but the deep thought and detail that goes into it is unparalleled, in the hands of De Palma, Bergman and Stone, though let's not forget the acting talents of Pacino, Bauer, and Pfeiffer that made this epic come to life. <br />Indeed, what was undoubtedly startling, was Pacino's depiction of the lead characterin this epic, in stark contrast to his tiny number of previous roles, forcing us to abandon, from our minds, the portrayal of the careful, considerate Michael Corleone Pacino mastered in both The Godfather legends, even though both motion pictures are of the same genres. This, however, indicates Pacino's ability to play several different roles with different personalities displayed to his characters, without losing his touch as an actor.  <br />Scarface manages to plant mixed feelings in every individual who watches this motion picture.  <br />Nevertheless, this critic acclaims it as disturbingly good, but at a vulnerable and controversial time.  <br />Although it failed to perform well at the box-office, sources have led this columnist to believe that it has widely placed an impact in the underground world.  <br />Though, do note however, that no matter how forceful the action keeps your eyes glued to the screen, try to find time to enjoy the music in the film; from an orchestral epilogue, (that makes you display a sense of ambivalence of pity and resentment towards Tony Montana), to the hot, saucy tunes played in the club scenes, (that forces you to move your body and embarrassingly sing \\"She's On Fire!!!!\\" in a minor, high-pitched, and very feminine voice\\"). <br />This thriller persevered a great deal, but succeeded with flying colours, to rise above its formulaic limitations; not only from the trademarks phrases and scenes, but from its definitive, artistic, and cinematic portrait, of the rise and fall of one of the most powerful men, ever to grace our silver screens for an excruciatingly long time.  <br />
B00006RCOB|3.0|If you like 70-80's flicks, and relish an inexpensive movie, this is a great buy. <br /> <br />Made in 1982 with Clint Eastwood as star and director.  Filled with the typical Soviet Era images:  oppressive government forces, secret police constantly asking \\"where are your papers\\" and Jewish scientist forced to work on secret projects <br /> <br />Clint Easwood plays a troubled Vietnam Era veteran suffering from flashbacks (I hate that cliche) who speaks fluent Russian and is an experienced fighter pilot.  He is pulled from retirement to steal the FIREFOX, a top secret Russian fighter plane that is more advanced than anything in NATO's arsenal. <br /> <br />The action sequences are a bit dated, but the plane is definitely cool.  For the most part, they used good props.  Makarov pistols and AK-47's are the standard weapons.  At least they got that part right.   <br /> <br />Overall, not a bad movie for $5.  Worth watching if you are interested in pop culture of the Cold War Era. <br /> <br />
B0002NRRAG|1.0|While many here have noted Peyroux's self-conscious attempts to imitate Billie Holiday's singing style (especially as regards her elocution), no one seems to have noted her utter lack of any innate rhythmic sense--a far cry from Lady Day's wonderful syncopative skills. The result is not jazz, but rather a sort of musical treacle that sounds great to those who are only familiar with Billie Holiday as background music to wine tastings and vapid conversation... Those who know the early Holiday will also lament the complete lack of that plaintive, ingenue-like voice that seems so utterly guileless when compared with the pyrotechnics of Ella Fitzgerald, for example. In short, if you are going to imitate, you would be wiser to imitate the imitable--not the inimitable Lady Day, whose own words regarding self-conscious imitation Peyroux would do well to take to heart: \\"I can't stand to sing the same song the same way two nights in succession. If you can, then it ain't music, it's close order drill, or exercise or yodeling or something, not music.\\"
B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles took 18 months between their fourth and fifth albums, reportedly spending eight months in the studio recording Hotel California. The album was also their first to be made without Bernie Leadon, who had given the band much of its country flavor, and with rock guitarist Joe Walsh. As a result, the album marks a major leap for the Eagles from their earlier work, as well as a stylistic shift toward mainstream rock. An even more important aspect, however, is the emergence of Don Henley as the band's dominant voice, both as a singer and a lyricist. On the six songs to which he contributes, Henley sketches a thematic statement that begins by using California as a metaphor for a dark, surreal world of dissipation; comments on the ephemeral nature of success and the attraction of excess; branches out into romantic disappointment; and finally sketches a broad, pessimistic history of America that borders on nihilism. Of course, the lyrics kick in some time after one has appreciated the album's music, which marks a peak in the Eagles' playing. Early on, the group couldn't rock convincingly, but the rhythm section of Henley and Meisner has finally solidified, and the electric guitar work of Don Felder and Joe Walsh has arena-rock heft. In the early part of their career, the Eagles never seemed to get a sound big enough for their ambitions; after changes in producer and personnel, as well as a noticeable growth in creativity, Hotel California unveiled what seemed almost like a whole new band. It was a band that could be bombastic, but also one that made music worthy of the later tag of \\"classic rock,\\" music appropriate for the arenas and stadiums the band was playing. The result was the Eagles' biggest-selling regular album release, and one of the most successful rock albums ever.  <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I'm glad I saw this film before I read any reviews or saw the play in New York or Toronto. The magic of the \\"night\\" blew me away and has filled my senses ever since!  My heart started racing when the organ was rumbling the intro, and I watched the chandelier rise to the ceiling. The changing panorama of the Opera Populaire from decaying dregs to golden slave girls and opulent red velvet seating was terrific. I felt myself surrender entirely to the \\"Phantom\\" experience.  Emmy  Rossum was outstanding as the teenaged \\"Christine\\". Wide-eyed, innocent, and with a vocal range that showed training, breadth, and inspiration. Patrick Wilson as \\"Raul\\" had that strong tenor needed to cement the good-guy role and portrayed just enough self-confidence and self-importance that any Viscompt would provide.  (Now, here's where your senses really start to tingle) The haunting \\"Brava, brava, bravisima\\" filters into the speakers. Scant moments later we catch our first face-to-face glimpse of the soulful Phantom through the dressing room mirror. It's all you can do to stay seated! Gerard Butler then entices Christine (and us) down to his dandy dungeon (and the darkest portions of his longing) on a feverish, muscle-tensing trek that's never resolved--even when the credits roll! His rendition of  \\"Music of the Night\\" is a heart-stopping, seduction of the audience as well as the heroine which caresses with more than just the impassioned words. In fact, Butler played the role with so much raw sensuality that we couldn't help but believe the madman was the better choice for any woman between the ages of 18 to 100. He makes you feel what he loves, hates, desires...and his mania, too!  As for the rest, see it--trust me!  PS: One reviewer said that there should have been a sex scene. Believe me, the whole movie IS a sex scene. And after all, isn't it better when you can use your brain, too? As for the people who had seen the play in the Big Apple and Toronto? They stood up and cheered and said\\"he (Lloyd-Webber) got it all!\\"
B00004W510|5.0|The Band's first album, Music From Big Pink, seemed to come out of nowhere, with its ramshackle musical blend and songs of rural tragedy. The Band, the group's second album, was a more deliberate and even more accomplished effort, partially because the players had become a more cohesive unit and partially because guitarist Robbie Robertson had taken over the songwriting, writing or co-writing all 12 songs. Though a Canadian, Robertson focused on a series of American archetypes from the union worker in \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" and the retired sailor in \\"Rockin' Chair\\" to, most famously, the Confederate Civil War observer Virgil Cane in \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\\" The album effectively mixed the kind of mournful songs that had dominated Music From Big Pink, here including \\"Whispering Pines\\" and \\"When You Awake\\", with rollicking uptempo numbers like \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" and \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\". As had been true of the first album, it was the Band's sound that stood out the most, from Helm's propulsive drumming to Robertson's distinctive guitar fills and the endlessly inventive keyboard textures of Garth Hudson, all topped by the rough, expressive singing of Manuel, Helm, and Rick Danko that mixed leads with harmonies. The arrangements were simultaneously loose and assured, giving the songs a timeless appeal, while the lyrics continued to paint portraits of 19th century rural life, its sometimes less savory aspects treated with warmth and humor.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I've been reading a lot of these viewer reviews, and one thing that stands out to me is the variety of interpretations people have of this one film. This film can interpreted in a multitude of ways. Some people see it as a commentary on the soulless nature of our consumer society. Others see it as discussion about the emasculation and alienation that men face in our modern culture. Some people focus on the anarchic aspects, and the irony of how men seeking individuality become identical drones in a terrorist organization. Then there's the psychological aspect of one person integrating their divergent personalities. This film is all these things, and probably even more that I can't think of. <br /> <br />For me, the whole film can be seen as metaphor for the search for equilibrium. Everything in the film is about the conflict between opposites, and one man's struggle to find peace and balance in this never-ending struggle. It's about the conflict between the animal impulse and civilization, between men and women, between chaos and order, between life and death. The soap that cleans you, is paradoxically made from the decomposing waste of dead animals. It's no coincidence that Jack's coffee table is a yin-yang design. Jack settles his conflict with Marla by negotiating a fair split of the resource they both want, the cancer support groups, a very feminine method of conflict resolution. Tyler settles his conflicts by threatening to castrate those who oppose his wishes, a rather more masculine and aggressive method of negotiation. The entire film is about Jack's integration of these competing impulses, and it's also about how the entire world stuggles to deal with the same issues. <br /> <br />Life and everything is this constant struggle between light and dark, and neither side can be complete by itself. Unrestrained order leads to the soulless emptiness of Jack's furniture quest, unrestrained chaos leads to the nihilistic self-destruction of Tyler's anarchy. The ending is spot-on perfect as Jack integrates himself achieving peace and order, through the violence and chaos of shooting himself. Order arising from chaos, just as life itself arises from the primordial soup. It's very Zen, and I loved it. Best movie I've seen in years. <br /> <br />
B000002U82|5.0|By condensing the sonic explorations of Meddle to actual songs and adding a lush, immaculate production to their trippiest instrumental sections, Pink Floyd inadvertently designed their commercial breakthrough with Dark Side of the Moon. The primary revelation of Dark Side of the Moon is what a little focus does for the band. Roger Waters wrote a series of songs about mundane, everyday details which aren't that impressive by themselves, but when given the sonic backdrop of Floyd's slow, atmospheric soundscapes and carefully placed sound effects, they achieve an emotional resonance. But what gives the album true power is the subtly textured music, which evolves from ponderous, neo-psychedelic art rock to jazz fusion and blues-rock before turning back to psychedelia. It's dense with detail, but leisurely paced, creating its own dark, haunting world. Pink Floyd may have better albums than Dark Side of the Moon, but no other record defines them quite as well as this one.
B0006A9FMI|2.0|Well I certainly don't like admitting this but I had a real tough time following this film.  By the end I had pretty much thrown my hands up and was simply enjoying the animation.  That said I have yet to see an anime film I actually liked. I say down with \\"Cowboy Bebop\\" and \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" and \\"Metropolis.\\" This film may have had the best animation of any anime film I have ever seen, so by the time I had given up I still had something to savor. It somehow managed to be moody and vibrant and real and not all at the same time.  The problem comes when the characters began philosophizing. They would walk the streets throwing around quotes from the Bible and Milton and Confucius, yet I just couldn't tie it to the plot.  This caused the movie to look like pontification central.  Maybe it just all went over my head, I'm a history major after all, not a philosophy one.  It did make me wonder though what would happen if Pixar had the nerve to have an edge.  The Japanese are more than willing to include in their animated stories blood and violence and smoking by characters who aren't villains, while over hear we make films about fish and toys (very good films of course).  Oh well, I'll add this to the long line of anime films that I vote no to and will try again soon.  **1/4
B0006284JQ|1.0|A Britney Spears greatest hits package? Are you kidding me? This is the musical equivalent of a Jeffrey Dahmer cookbook. Ye gads. The only greatest hits Britney has are courtesy of a push-up bra. I'd barely classify this as music. Cats in a blender produce a more melodious tone. The fact that people can actually call this a &quot;greatest album ever!&quot; leaves me in despairing. Oh, the humanity! And yes, I've listened to it, much to my chagrin. I visited a friend who has a couple of adolescent girls in the house. They insisted on playing it...over and over and over...if there's a hell, this is the music playing in the lobby.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|There are few bands out there that have such a sound. At the drive-ins sound is hard to clasify,just raw power. The defening sounds of the guitars, the unusual time signatures used, they all show a glimpse of what would become Sparta and The Mars Volta.  <br /> <br />Between the raw guitar chords is an ever so sweet melody, that is imposible to forget. Cedric's vocals are shouted with passion. There are no lack luster tracks here, this is not a collection of singles this is an album. All 12 tracks are unique and special in some kind of way.   <br /> <br />There are few bands out there that can restore my faith in music, specially these days, At the drive-in is one of them. Five stars.
B000002H97|5.0|BUY IT!!!! If you have read any reviews for the black album then mine will be nothing new.  This is just a great album to listen to.  Not the best Metallica CD (Master of Puppets), but an awesome listen nonetheless.  Favorite tracks: Wherever I May Roam, Don't Tread on Me, Through the Never
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I've been a long time fan of the original \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" movie, but I truly believe Innocence surpasses it. It's definately the most visually stunning film I've ever seen and that alone is enough to give it 5 stars. The soundtrack and score are just icing on the cake. The only flaw with this movie rest in the dialogue, in particular the constant quoting of various classical works and figures. I must warn however, this is a movie for thinkers. If you are not partial to pondering questions of the soul, then just turn off the subtiltles and watch the pretty pictures and listen to the pretty sounds.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This IS one of teh best metal-core cd's I have ever heard, the guitars drums and vocals are phenomonal.  I am a fan of a lot of euro-metal and only like some metal core bands, but this is definately one of them. i had heard about them from my friend so I decided to pick it up, it is the best non euro cd I have ever heard.  The guitars play  a lot of harmonies over the top of the awesome drumming and crazy vocals.  I read a review that the album gets repeditive but I disagree and I am pretty picky about repeditive cd's.  I recommend this to any metal fan, also Shadows Fall and if you like euro, try Children of Bodom.
B0000CAXIC|4.0|this album will have a track that'll please everyone who has working eardrums. this is my personal favourite of the foo' work. it has everything from hard hitting anthems like 'monkey wrench', through punchy ballads like 'february stars' to God-like stadium rockers 'everlong'. buy this disc, stand in the middle of your living room and jump around like a mad person with your hands firmly placed in an air guitar position.a genuine object of mastery that dave grohl problably sleeps with under his pillow.
B00005JNQQ|4.0|Much to my suprise, I thought Robots was just going to be good. But, it's much more than that. It's a wild and crazy adventure through Rodney Copperbottom's trip to Robot City. <br /> <br />Ewen Mcgregor was good. He wasn't the best one, but he was good. I think he played Rodney a little too dramatic in the Big Weld scene, and that's what threw me off a bit with him. <br /> <br />Robin Williams, however, was a hoot as Fender! He, as always, probably improvised with a lot of things. He did such a great job when he was \\"singing in the oil\\". Not to mention, he sang for help two times. Now that kicks! <br /> <br />Amanda Bynes was very cute as the little sister, Piper. She sounded so relaxed, and that was what made her character shine. <br /> <br />The animation was just like any other CGI film, except for two amazing scenes. The scene where Rodney and Fender are in that bubble type car just is amazing! It looks like it could be a ride itself! And, the Big Weld domino scene was really cool too. It made the shape of Big Weld, and not to mention, it looked like an ocean, and it sure was! <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this movie. Every single character played a funny role, which I liked. Some minor role point-outs were Al Roker as the mailbox, and Paul Giamatti as Tim, the gate guard of Big Weld Industries. All in all, I'd give this a solid B+. After all this praising you may ask, why did she give a B+? Well, I thought The Incredibles kicked butt, so I guess it's down there with Ice Age and stuff. <br /> <br />By the way, this to the kid who judged the movie on its bad poster and trailer: YOU probably look bad too! Oh let's see..the horrible shoes, the shirt! Ugh! (Heh heh)
B000077VPU|3.0|Like some of the other reviewers, I am lucky to have the VHS version of the concert. Believe it or not, the VHS version is much better than the DVD version....The DVD version has only half of the concert.....i love the first half of the concert, but its not included on the dvd. The whole dvd would have been enjoyable if the ENTIRE concert was on it :-(
B000003TA4|1.0|I don't know what to say except it not my type of music. I'm into punk/rock and rock/pop!  I can't say that they suck just because i am not into their type of music.  The only really decent song on this cd is track number five.  So why did i give this such a low score? It because most of the track are so hard to understand, i mean it sound like english mix with a foreign accent.  Anyway this is my review:  I just hope this review help!  If u like band like evanescence, linkin park, trapt, seether, good charlotte, blink 182, green day, simple plan, maroon 5, three day grace, third eye blind, yellow car, disturbed, drowning pool, dashboard confessional, ramone, vice squad, then don't buy this cd because you won't like it.  If you are into metal and loud obnoxious hardcore music then this is a wonderful add-on to your collection. <br /> <br />However i do admit that the guitar and drum sound are top notch! <br />I hope this help!
B0006J28BO|4.0|This film obviously cannot compete with Ghibli's Spirited Away. It does offer an interesting plot and has some very funny moments. The basic story is about a young school girl who saves this cat (she doesn't know it's a cat prince) from being run over by a truck in the street. She is thanked by cat kingdom with an assortment of gifts that only a cat could appreciate (mice, cat nip, etc). She travels into cat kingdom because the cat king wishes her to marry his son. Like all Studio Ghibli films, the first 15 minutes of the film are normal and then the film takes you on a wild journey into a different world. Children and adults can enjoy this film. The DVD extras are not very impressive but the quality is good.
B000089RVX|5.0|I would have to say that Evanescence sound better on a cd then in a live concert.  I think it due to the loud and disturbing noise of the crown.  Needless to say, this is one of my favorite album beside Good Charlotte.  Amy lee has one of the most incredible voice i have heard.  Her voice is so unique.  This demostrate how the first song i heard was \\"going under\\" and i was hooked.  I knew i had to buy this album and i did just that.  I have no regret what so ever. I could swear i have never heard a voice like it.  One of my favorite song is my \\"immortal\\".  In my opinion, it does sound like a titantic song and that definity a good thing.   <br /> <br />Now i will review track by track: <br />1. Going Under 5/5 i love this song so much ( i am just speechless) <br /> <br />2. Bring me to life 5/5 (another one of those classic that is almost impossible to miss) <br /> <br />3. Everybody's fool 5/5 Started out like country but end up like an instant classic that is really hard to forget. <br /> <br />4. My Immortal 5/5 like the other reviewer, this was also the first song i listen to. I was absolutely hook to this band with just one song.  I don't know why, but it turn out that this band produce top quality music that is listenable to all ages! <br /> <br />5. Haunted 5/5 This started out as creepy, which is a really good thing.  If you thought the first four song was unique, this will truly blown you away. <br /> <br />6. Tourniquet 5/5 <br /> <br />7. Imaginary 5/5 make me wanna cry because why on earth i have not listen to this band earlier. <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me 5/5 the song sound so familiar.  I myself don't listen to the radio a lot but it just sound so familiar.  Taken into account this is a flawless album to say the least. <br /> <br />9. Hello 5/5 a classic song with slow melody!  I normally would hate slow song, but this one has finally change my mind. <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath 5/5 Another song that lighten up the mood. <br /> <br />11. Whisper 5/5 normally a cd would only have one good ending song, but that not the case here.  I would probably say any song would be a great ending song mainly due to the fact that a lot of the song here is about leaving this world, or of that nature. <br /> <br />12. [import] 5/5 i believe this song is my lmmortal.  The reason it import is that it add one of the best song twice!   <br /> <br />Bottom line: what are u waiting for? Get out there and buy this cd now if u haven't.  It make a wonderful collection! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|Words cannot express what an incredible film this is. I love that Miyazaki has included so much  Japanese mythology and culture into this film. The film can be slightly confusing if you only watch it once, but I think this has more to do with the English translation being confusing rather than the actual plot. The film is visually stunning and the musical score accomodates it with perfect harmony. This is by far Miyazaki's greatest work in my opinion. In fact, this was the first film that I've ever seen my Miyazaki and I had the pleasure of seeing it in the theater when it was released in the United States. I have so much respect for Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki's work after seeing this film.
B00005JL0I|2.0|I agree with the review that called this movie \\"AUSTIN POWERS without the laughs\\". About half way through the movie it becomes so absurd that it is not funny. <br />To make things worse this movie is upheld as the funniest spoof on James Bond. So the expectations are set way above of this movie potential. Be warned if you go for this movie - you are going to shake your had more than laugh....
B0002YLC24|5.0|Like its prequel, Before Sunset is an hour and a half of delicious colloquy and a chemistry so effortless you'd probably find this film in the organic section of your local store.<br /><br />To recap, they had met on a Eurorail trip to Vienna, had a one night romance that was innocently adoloscent but never vulgar, one that culminated into a pact to meet six months later.<br /><br />As we pick up nine years hence, they've both perceptibly come of age. He's living a farce of a marriage, she seems numb to her erstwhile buoyant mien. Once again, we get a healthy dose of casual-on-the-surface conversation that seems determined to breathe in its own space and spew pearls of wisdom such as \\"Memory is a wonderful thing if you don't have to deal with the past\\".<br /><br />As the minutes tick by before he catches his plane, so do the confessions, building to a do-they-or-don't-they crescendo.  Teasingly frustrating in its ambiguity, the final scene -&#8212; facile, heady, sexy as Lycra -&#8212; avoids a conventionally neat conclusion, instead tantalizing us with yet more questions. As Delphie's character herself mentions during the chitchat, such a denouement could mean different things to different people depending on whether one's a romantic optimist or a presumptuous cynic.<br /><br />If you ask me, it works superbly. Though the film has much more going for it. There're some stunning acting sequences with uninterrupted takes for minutes on end. There's that familiar, delectable brand of wit that'll keep you glued. There's even an acoustic guitar performance at the end by Delphie herself, and my, what a breathtaking moment that is.<br /><br />I hope they make a Before Next Sunrise 10 years from now, and a Before Next Sunset 20 years hence. I'm curious how this plays out. Plus I'm addicted to this rare glimpse of intelligent, non-Disney romance from Hollywood.<br /><br />Must-watch, at least once.
B00000272N|5.0|This is the definative Heavy metal grunge album of that era because it opened doors for copycats like Godsmack, Bush, Candlebox, etc. WIf your true to your Grunge roots you better have this album otherwise your just a poser metalhead man.
B00005JN4O|5.0|It is not easy to gripe about a sweetly sentimental film that deals un-mawkishly with a theme as mawkish as this, but if you've seen the recent Ewan McGregor starrer 'Big Fish,' you may find Neverland wanting in luster. But I'm putting the horse before the cart, plus that's not the point.<br /><br />Several glowing tributes in major publications had me convinced that Neverland was a biopic of JM Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan. In reality the film is not smitten one bit with the misery of historical precision - google for Barrie and you'll see even his looks were a world apart from a very comely Johnny Depp.<br /><br />It is more a silver-tongued ode to the magic of imagination, to the pursuit of a joy in art that's elusive in the Real World, to the value of retaining a childlike wonder while acquiring a mature understanding of the world.<br /><br />On all of those levels, it eclipsed my expectations. Even if we were to discount Peter Pan and think of Barrie as just an obscure, failed writer, this heartfelt film would still enchant with equal intensity.<br /><br />The screenplay glides between full-blown fantasy sequences to reveal the fertility of Barrie's brain while keeping us grounded in reality. If Big Fish and Neverland were put belly to belly, I suspect that the former would have an edge, but Neverland's set up of its context is fluent and fascinating while sporting some old Edwardian restraint.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is probably one of the finest actors around, I marvel at his ability to find poetry in his character while turning in a measured presence with a very unobstrusive Scottish accent. He even looks about 15 years younger than his real age. I've never seen Kate Winslet as maternal as this but she's luminous nonetheless. An egging romantic subplot is tossed between the two, always platonic on the surface but not without a tinge of intrigue if you pay attention to those prolonged glances.<br /><br />Hoffman has an embarrasingly marginal role, so if you're expecting some histrionics from him, don't. It is unclear why he's doing this -- Lemony Snicket has a painfully trivial appearance from him too.<br /><br />The true stars of the show however are the four young boys, especially Freddie Highmore who plays the cynical child to whom \\"Peter\\" Pan was dedicated.<br /><br />There will understandably be some quibbles with this film. Perhaps the scope is too modest -- we barely begin to enjoy Barrie's consummation of his fantasties when all of it comes to an abrupt end. Or perhaps, especially in hindsight, it all feels like we stepped on the sob pedal too hard, which is not helped by some pat dialgue about, gulp, 'believe in it'.<br /><br />If you come away from this film with such a Scrooge-like perspective, it's ironically a good sign that you need a ticket to Neverland yourself.<br /><br />It's a well-done, moving film. I enjoyed my time in the theatre. Pack your Kleenex, keep your quixotic horses saddled, and soon, like the audience in the film itself, you'll find yourself wondering if we ever really let go of that child in ourselves. Marvellous film.u're expecting some histrionics from him, don't.

B0000508U6|1.0|I read the reviews and then I listened to the samples. If this is \\"great\\" music then I'm a bow-legged octopus. This is boring folk-rock at it's best. I cannot believe what's being passed on as \\"talent\\" nowadays. And to characterize this as \\"perfect\\" is stretching common sense and rationality to their very limits.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|A long time ago, bands used to make albums.  True albums that you sat down with headphones and listened to from beginning to end.  As far as \\"rock\\" music goes, this was about as artistic as you could ever get.  Bands like the Beatles, Zeppelin and Pink Floyd wrote long, complex arranged music with storylines and themes that could arouse the brain and the soul.  In recent years the music industry has saturated the airwaves with power pop.  3 minute throwaway songs with little-to-no artistic merit at all and simple, mindless catch-phrase lyrics.  Aside from a handfull of truly daring artists (Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, TOOL etc.), the idea of a \\"concept album\\" has become largely extinct.  I for one, am excited to see Mars Volta do something as inspired as \\"Frances The Mute.\\"  With heavy music falling prey to the banality of Nickelbacks and Linkin Parks and Orange County rap-core flavors of the week, it's good to see that somebody is willing to do something truly artistic.  There's definitely not enough of that happening today in music. <br /> <br />I initially didn't like Mars Volta because of the Rush-like vocals but have since learned to stop trying to judge the music based on my pre-conceived notions of what music should be, and simply let the music move me...or not.  This album definitely moved me.  Incredible musicianship, great melodies and very interesting blends of styles.  Very innovative.  I'll have to go back and listen to Deloused in this new light. <br /> <br />This album doesn't have much in the way of \\"radio hits\\", but if that's what you want go buy a Brittney Spears or a J-Lo album.  The radio sucks anyways, so hopefully Mars Volta will steer clear of the talent-less tarpit known as major radio. <br /> <br />Check this album out.  It is almost on a level with Tool's modern classic, AENIMA.  This album rocks.  If you dig Mars Volta but want something even heavier check out the following:  <br /> <br />Snapcase- End Transmission <br />Refused- Shape of Punk to Come <br />Converge- You Fail Me <br />The Bled- Pass The Flask
B000059H9E|5.0|By now all movie buffs have been exposed to the singular genius of Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and the numerous solid films he has placed before his admiring public.  Though generally recognized as the maestro of zany, over the edge, ludicrous comedies, his later works have included such tender and truly gripping films as 'Talk to Her' and 'All About My Mother' and it is into this vein that LIVE FLESH falls.<br /><br />The story is just as surreal as any he has filmed and certainly the quality of the filming, direction and acting is on a par with the best of his work, but LIVE FLESH  deals with some fairly grim issues that in the hands of other directors might have become either ruinous parodies of the old films from the 1940s or as bloody boring and tired retreads.  Herein lies Almodovar's magic.<br /><br />Beginning in 1970 Franco's Madrid, a prostitute (Penelope Cruz) goes into labor and with the aid of what appears to be a transvestite fellow hooker gives birth to a son Victor (later played by Liberto Rabal) - on a bus!  Flash forward to the 1990s and Victor is caught in a drug deal by two policemen David (Javier Bardem) and Sancho (Jose Sancho).  In the ruckus David is shot in the spine resulting in paraplegia.  Victor is imprisoned, David becomes a national hero as a paraplegic basketball player married to Clara who runs an orphanage and though she loves David, her sexual needs are only minimally met by David.  Sancho has become an alcoholic macho cop.<br /><br />When Victor is released form prison he pledges revenge on David and Sancho, falls under the influence of Clara from whom he learns his role as a sexual male and begins an affair with her, and when eventually David discovers Clara's 'betrayal' he is able to forgive for the sake of his love for his wife's plight at living with a paraplegic. Victor progresses toward being the decent human being capable of reform and the film closes in the circular manner of most of Almodovar's films: Clara is giving birth to Victor's son 'in transit' in 1996!<br /><br />The actual story is, of course, much more convoluted and tightly profound than this too brief summary, but you must see the process by watching the film to garner all the beauty that is Almodovar's gift for story telling. Every member of the cast is superb and the action moves at such a fast pace, with just the right amount of sensual sexual encounters to keep in line with Almodovar's style, that this film seems very short.  The vivid color palette and the completely appropriate musical score are also trademarks of this gifted director.  Highly recommended!

B00006D295|4.0|I had to re write this first sentence because I was going to start this review by saying this is one of my few guilty(movie)pleasures.<br />But I can't honestly say I can feel guilty in any way about this film.It is such a fantastic send up and musical romp of the horror/sci fi film genre done in such a unique manner that I'm into it from beginning to end without a second thought.<br />Now this is a film I believe that to really experience it you should have seen it at least once at a movie theatre.There you would not only come to understand why it is such a cult phenom but it would enchance your viewing of it in your own home.I have seen it many,many times \\"live\\" and I always find myself referencing that when I watch it now at home.<br />I have watched this movie in home with people who had only heard of the film but never had had the opportunity to see it \\"live\\".Some have liked it but the general concensus is one of either \\"huh?\\" or \\"I don't get it\\".The sexual references in the film coupled with the suggestive dress seems to be an off-putting factor that with proper pre theatre exposure would I think in most cases allay their feelings quite a bit.<br />This review is probably going to be read more by those who are already RHPS converts so this is probably the one review I will ever write that will be preaching,more than any other,to the \\"choir\\".<br />However if you are a RHPS virgin,I would recommend you see this film \\"live\\" first,if at all possible.If you can't, just view it with an open mind and sit back and let IT do the walking and talking.You are in for a totally unique viewing experience unlike any other you will have.The plot is see through to be sure but let the characters and especially the music just wash over you and go with the wonderful flow.<br />Richard O'Brien masterminded this beauty which has been translated not only onto film but to wildly successful stage productions as well.I find it hasn't aged a bit and the hard driving soundtrack is a sure fire winner all the way.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Sorry kids, the double bass is EXACTLY the same as painkiller,and it's the same sound and speed in every song. Boring!! Is it a drum track? I love the increased bass volume. Makes the album heavier! Rob sounds better than ever. Glenn and KK have always had a good sound, I liked every song except worth fighting for, kinda weak for me. So... all in all it's a good album, I just hate the boring double bass. definitely worth  the money. Cheers
B000008L90|4.0|J. Arcila, according to the Summer Fever Pick from donna-tribute.com, \\"Cats Without Claws\\" is OUT OF PRINT.  I'm not certain if it ever made it on CD.  I still have the album on cassette (I made sure to take good care of it).  The only thing I can suggest is to 1) call record stores that specializes in disco/dance/R&B music (they may know if it is available on CD), 2) keep checking on eBay (there is a good chance you may find it on vinyl if not on CD), 3) go to thrift stores and garage sales.  I hope this helps.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|Donnie Darko is one of the most original and compelling films ever made.  I give the movie a firm 5 stars.  For details of the film, read the other reviews.  Suffice to say that it's a haunting, brilliantly cut film-noir with very interesting characters and superb acting by the entire cast.   <br /> <br />The Director's Cut, however, lacks.  I firmly believe that director's cuts should add new footage, not change existing footage.  With 20 extra minutes, there's a new scene here and there, but the most obvious changes are in the way certain scenes play out.  The eyeball thing every time Donnie encounters Frank the rabbit doesn't quite seem to fit, and the time travel sequence at the end is just way to busy-looking to be enjoyed.  I much preferred the simplicity of the way that scene played out in the original.  A few tiny segments have been cut entirely, and that bothers me because in this movie, it's the little things that make it interesting.  The 5.1 surround sound has also been re-edited, and again, I prefer the original.  During the Sparkle Motion scene at the talent show, the sound quality of the Duran Duran song is terrible, but halfway through, it fixes itself.  The picture quality is far worse than the original cut. <br /> <br />All in all, I think the original is better.  The excerpts from the \\"Philosophy of Time Travel\\" book is a nice change though.  Rent this first before you buy.

B00000JRTX|5.0|This is the one when we first see Hugh Grant as the bumbling, awkward British toff, hankering madly for sexy American (MacDowell) and having lots of fun with his smashing freinds who all slowly discover their desire to find that someone special. Grant is ok, his usual fayre was fresh and new here, MacDowell is somewhat lack lustre too, the real acting here for me is provided by Scott Thomas as the love lorn female freind and Coleman as the whacky and delightful Scarlett (Coleman sadly died of an asthma attack a few years ago, this film now stands as her best work). If you have not seen this you must have been living under a stone! but do see it when you need cheering up, it's a lovely, tender, sad, naughty and hilarious movie and the best of the bunch of films it spawned.
B000069AUI|3.0|I give Coldplay 3 stars because they proved to me that any band that knows how to play a couple notes over & over again and write simple lyrics can touch the hearts of so many people! As a musician this is a very comforting thought. <br />however... <br />I don't listen to this cd. It just doesn't have any substance. the lyrics are boaring and the music is very simple (trust me... I've red the tabs!). <br />If you like the songs \\"In My Place\\" \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\" then by all means buy this CD. Otherwise check out Radiohead \\"OK Computer\\".
B000002OTL|5.0|With a really great movie, comes a really great soundtrack with it. Please note people that it says Explicit Lyrics, but do not pay attention to it because there only like 3 or 4 songs with a few cuss words. These words usually come from the little diaglogues, or the talking before the song. Other than that this is a great cd with all the good songs from the movie. It may be missing out on like 3 or 4 songs, but this will suffice. All QT soundtracks are like this, so check out the others too. BUY IT.
0553573403|5.0|I'm a former wheel of time fan.<br /><br />After suffering through the last WoT book (Crossroad of Twilight) I decided I was done with the whole genre.  The Book is insufferable trash and after all, every review of Jordan procliamed him as the next coming of tolkein, the best in the genre blah blah blah.<br /><br />Then I decided to read some of the customer reviews of Crossroads. The reviewers for the most part felt like I did. What surprised me is how many of them mentioned the Fire and Ice books as an example of what a really good series ought to be like.<br /><br />I finally decided to look at it and within 2 weeks I read all three of the books currently in print.  The battles are amazing.  the story gripping, the characters interesting and the humor is hillarious.  G R.R. Martin isn't the next coming of Tolkein, he is ten times better than Tolkein.  Truly his work takes the genre to a new level Tolkein never even sniffed at and Jordan will never reach either.<br /><br />You'll want to keep these books after you read them.
B000021YQV|4.0|This is not as good as System's other two CDs, but its decent. The version of this that comes with a DVD is great. It has three live performances and a the music video for \\"Toxicity\\". The songs on this CD are very heavy, but they still just don't sound as good as the songs on their self-titled debut. \\"Prison Song\\" is a kick ass opener with great vocals and a nice opening riff. \\"Needles\\" is a goofy song about...tape worms? \\"ATWA\\" is a song about the mind of serial killer Charles Manson. As you can see, most of the songs on this CD either have no topic, or a strange topic. Most of SOAD's songs are like that. Their's nothing wrong with it, it just gets boring sometimes when a band you listen to a lot sings about...well, basically nothing important. These guys definetely have talent. The limited edition version that comes with a DVD is out of print, so if you haven't bought this yet, you'll have to buy a copy of the original version. It isn't as good as SOAD's other two releases, but its still a must own for any System of A Down fan.
B00005JNQQ|4.0|For everyone keeping score, there are now three computer animation studios out there:  Pixar, the old favorite; DreamWorks Animation, which is more about pop and fizz than actual storytelling; and Blue Sky Studios, the new kid on the block, having just released its second film, \\"Robots\\".  Blue Sky appears to place itself somewhere between Pixar and DreamWorks: flashier than Pixar, but more concerned with making a good movie than filling the screen with pop culture references.<br /><br />2002's \\"Ice Age\\" was a sizable hit for Blue Sky Studios.  While it didn't exactly make Disney and Pixar quake in their corporate shoes, it was a blip on the computer animation radar screen too big to be ignored.  The mix of dramatic storytelling, light humor, and crisp animation made the film a winner at the box office.  Now with money, Blue Sky has invested in better animation and a larger cast in their new movie, \\"Robots\\".  But a bigger cast is not necessarily a good thing.  Rather than just the four characters that dominated \\"Ice Age\\", a plethora of complex well-voiced robots star in this picture, which can make it hard to keep up with what everybody is doing at any given time.<br /><br /> Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor) lives in a little burg in a world of robotic beings.  Rather than settle for being a dishwasher (literally, a dishwasher) like his father (Stanley Tucci), he decides to make something of himself and work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), a rather large and eccentric inventor who cares about the little guys even though he's a big time money-maker.<br /><br />Immediately upon arriving in Robot City, Rodney crosses paths with Fender (Robin Williams), a neglected and slightly unstable robot who leads a gang of out-of-date misfits just trying to get along in the world.  The problem is Big Weld's company has been corporatized, symbolized by Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), and no longer serves the public, but is only interested in making a profit.  While at first it appears that Ratchet is the evil mastermind, it soon becomes apparent that he is just being used by his own mother (Jim Broadbent) to do her evil bidding.<br /><br />As the protagonist, Rodney obviously must right the wrongs and save the day with a little help from his new friends.  It's a simple idea, but comes across well, with a good message or two to boot.  As animated movies go, \\"Robots\\" doesn't really have anything new, except perhaps stylistically.  The whole movie feels like a 1950's-style view of a robotic future, with shiny chrome, streamlined stuff, and fins.<br /><br />Of note to fellow geeks out there: as with the last Blue Sky film, the trailer for the next \\"Star Wars\\" film (with Ewan McGregor in a more dramatic role) is attached to \\"Robots\\".  And as trailers go, this one will certainly get your attention.  Also attached is short film starring Scrat, the little \\"Ice Age\\" rodent who's always after his acorn.<br /><br />\\"Robots\\" is a worthy effort, but falls short of becoming truly a classic, perhaps because it must juggle so many characters simultaneously.hat Ratchet is the evil mastermind, it soon becomes apparent that he is just being used by his own mother (Jim Broadbent) to do her evil bidding. <br />As the protagonist, Rodney obviously must right the wrongs and save the day with a little help from his new friends.

B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD is near perfect. In fact, it is almost as good as their awesome self-titled debut album (which is very hard to beat). On this CD are tracks that were recorded during various periods of time, all of which were previously unreleased. Some of them even date back to 1995 (before the band had even signed with a record company). Among the greater tracks on this CD is the accoustic guitar song \\"Roulette\\". The vocals on the song are lousy, but the guitars are brilliant. \\"F**k The System\\" is another example of a great song on this CD. \\"Innervision\\" and \\"Mr. Jack\\" are both classics. This album is way better than Toxicity, which fails to compare to their self-titled debut. The CD's opening track, \\"Chic'N'Stew\\" is very funny and very heavy. Pick this one up. It kicks ass.
B00000JCB2|3.0|this wuz my first limp bizkit album. i think it kicks ass, if you want to get into limp bizkit then start with this album. Either this or choclate startfish. Forget what people say about limp bizkit an just sit back an enjoy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|With Zep fans having had to make do with the impressive but flawed 'Song Remains the Same' for so long, the long-awaited arrival of this collection built expectations up to such a degree that only the most subliminal final product would suffice.  I had no need to worry though! This 5 hour, 2-disk collection has genuinely exceeded expectations and given us, quite simply, the most astoundingly brilliant DVD presentation of rock music to date! <br /> <br />With the main musical features - all in glorious 5.1/DTS sound (if you haven't already bought a surround-sound system, get one just for this and you will feel like you're up there in the mosh pit!) progressing in chronological sequence, this is an utterly compelling journey through the lifespan of rock's most legendary metal/blues/folk group!   <br /> <br />There is no dead wood here whatsoever, but, if pushed to pick highlights, it would have to be the blistering early performances of 'Dazed and Confused', 'What is and What Should Never Be' and the seminal 'Whole Lotta Love' through the 'Immigrant Song', 'Black Dog' and 'Since I've Been Loving You', then onto 'Trampled Underfoot' and the perennial show-stopper 'Stairway to Heaven' (even more impressive without the psychedelic distractions of the version on 'Song Remains the Same' and the final jaw-droppingly awesome performances of 'Rock and Roll', 'Kashmir' and a curiously but magnificently evolved 'Whole Lotta Love'. <br /> <br />Masses of extras - rare early footage, revealing press conferences, one-off show appearances, promotional material etc. makes this utterly superb collection an indispensable purchase for all true rock fans. <br />
0140277447|4.0|It is a very stunning book and stomach churning in which Iris Chang tells the story of many, in a respective manner dividing the stories into three seperate sections, Japanese, Chinese witnesses, and Foreigners. In The Rape of Nanking, she briefly describes the tragedy of many Chinese people who endured rape, murder, and cruel treatment from Japanese soldiers. Although many Japanese people deny the fact that this ever happened, this book really shows the true colors of this tragedy that will never be forgotten.
0451167716|5.0|If critics rated novels based on how well they hold the reader's interest, then THE GODFATHER would be hailed as a classic.  Author Mario Puzo (1920-1999) advances few noble ideas, but his story about New York's Corleone mafia family of the 1940's is just so...gripping.  The themes, of course, are timeless; power, greed, family loyalty, betrayal, revenge.  The story centers on syndicate Godfather Vito Corleone, and the eventual transfer of power to his initially reluctant son Michael. The peripheral characters are nearly as compelling; hot-headed Santino, reserved Tom Hagen, dangerous Virgil Sollozo, and innocent Kay Adams.  Puzo shows us how organized crime has its hands into many pies, including businesses, politics and finance.  I'd have liked less attention paid to the sexual antics of the Hollywood crowd, but the author makes every page interesting.  The book provides an excellent companion to the Oscar-winning 1972 movie (or vice versa), and covers many details that the film had no time for.   <br />Since first published in 1969, THE GODFATHER has been the top selling novel worldwide or very close to it.  Writers should read these pages to learn about gripping, readable prose.  Sadly, the author seemed unable to repeat his success with his other mob-related novels.    <br />
B000002H72|5.0|Spacey, fun, catchy, noisy and a little bit perverse, this album encapsulates everything that was good about The Pixies.  Fans of \\"Surfer Rosa\\" might be turned off by the glistening pop production, but that sound actually suits the Pixies well and there's still plenty of feedback and screaming vocals here.  In fact, Black Francis gives his best ever vocal performance on this album.  He's at once goofy, frightening, and on \\"Hey,\\" surprisingly emotional.  Kim Deal's backing vocals match perfectly with his and she contributes the album's weirdest song, the vaguely Morricone-esque \\"Silver.\\"  The rest of the songs on the album follow the now-familiar \\"alternative\\" mold that the Pixies helped establish, but the songwriting and quirky vibes keep \\"Doolittle\\" fresh even while then-contemporaries like Dinosaur Jr. sound dated today.  \\"Debaser\\" is an at once shiny and frantic tribute to a 1920s surrealist film.  \\"Wave Of Mutilation\\" is another in the long line of Pixies songs with tropical themes and \\"Gouge Away\\" is a romantic little number about, well, having your eyes gouged out.  All this combines into one gloriously weird, lovable mess of an album.  The fact that \\"Doolittle\\" has been ripped off right and left over the last 15 years and still sounds exciting and different is proof that this really is a classic album.
B000002ADT|5.0|Absolutely perfect if you want something mellow and indescribably pretty.  This record just exudes confidence.  It sounds nonchalant but it's really very calculated.  Miles is in absolute control of his instrument -- a master at work. <br /> <br />Just great!
B00000342V|5.0|Wow.  Possibly the greatest soundtrack of all time, Curtis Mayfield's \\"Superfly\\" is one song after another of deep, funky grooves and his best singing either with the Impressions or solo.  The best-known songs (\\"Pusherman,\\" \\"Freddie's Dead,\\" the title track) are the best stuff here but even the lesser known songs are great.  The soundtrack format fits Mayfield's music well because it inspired him to add lots of great cinematic touches that make \\"Superfly\\" more than just a party album.  Every song feels epic and larger life while still being gritty and streetwise.  Likewise, Mayfield's lyrics contain a positive message while never shying away from the dark sides of streetlife, something the too-glamorous movie sometimes did.  Simply put, this album is great in everyway possible.
B000001ESP|4.0|Moving Pictures is the album that put Rush's name - but not their picture - on the cover of Rolling Stone (RS #344, May 28, 1981).  It was the highest-charting album of the band's first 19 years (at #3; Counterparts hit #2 in 1993), and with sales of more than 4 million, it is the one even non-Rush fans have packed away somewhere. Moving Pictures found the band perfecting and refining the sound they had developed over the first 7 years of their career, but would also turn out to be a \\"goodbye to all that\\".  Their epic song structure is abandoned almost completely here, in favor of a tighter, more succinct sound.  Moving Pictures may not have made Rush an MTV fixture, a Top 40 singles regular, or Rolling Stone cover boys, but it did give them most of the audience that they still have today, and it gave to all of those who would forever insist that Rush sucks a reason to think that maybe they weren't all bad.<br /><br />The first track on this CD is \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" the song about which Rush haters say, \\"oh, but I do like that song.\\"  Keyboards play their first major role in a Rush song here, but they are largely absent for the the rest of the album (but not, alas, for the rest of the 80s).  \\"Tom Sawyer\\" contains all of the trademarks that make Rush who they are: high-pitched vocals, fat bass riffs, synth flourishes, over the top drums, understated and inspired guitars, and philosophical lyrics.  Which makes one wonder: why do naysayers like this song? After all, these are the things that supposedly make them hate the band? (I dunno.)<br /><br />Rush is often accused of always always sounding the same, but every song on this record sounds very different.  The bombastic opener gives way to \\"Red Barchetta\\", featuring Alex Lifeson's trademark natural harmonics and gentle arpeggios.  This is a great song, but it suffers a bit from its attempt to tell a story, in which the build-up, climax, and d&eacute;nouement are neither very discernible nor terribly interesting.  Still, the imagery is pretty cool, and the interplay is top notch, with Lifeson sounding as improvisational and inspired as he does on \\"Tom Sawyer\\".  (As far as the story goes, apparently wacko liberal environmentalists of the not-too-distant future have forced legislation which has banned environmentally unfriendly cars such as the Red Barchetta.  The protagonist is therefore breaking the law - \\"eluding the Eyes\\" - by driving the car.  The cars that chase him are the new environmentally friendly ones - perhaps driven by police - and are out to get him for his trangression.  The song is based on a short story by Richard S. Foster called \\"A Nice Morning Drive\\".)<br /><br />\\"YYZ\\" is an undeniably brilliant instrumental.  All three members shine throughout this record, but on this track, they go above and beyond even their own standards.  Lifeson and bassist Geddy Lee are equal leads during the verses.  The interlude - in which the members trade guitar strums, bass riffs, and drum fills - never fails to draw a huge applause in concert.  Lee and drummer Neil Peart's fills are taut and brief, but are also every bit as indicative of their talent as an entire solo could be.  Finally, Lifeson's slippery, wiry, Eastern-sounding guitar solo is perhaps the crowning achievement of his career, forcing one to lament his understatedness on subsequent releases.  This song makes me wish that Rush had an instrumental song on every album.<br /><br />\\"Limelight\\" - which closes this first side - is probably the most radio-friendly track on the record.  It features meaty distorted guitar riffs, octave-leaping basslines, and Peart's ever-steady drumming.  Lifeson's non-flashy, thoughtfully constructed solo is again a highlight, and Peart keeps the bottom from falling out beautifully.<br /><br />The second side of Moving Pictures is a bit more challenging than the first.  \\"The Camera Eye\\" shows that Rush wasn't quite ready to abandon the epic structure so prominently displayed on their previous albums.  This is not quite as good as \\"Natural Science\\", but is very listener-friendly for and 11-minute song.  It is told from the perspective of one who is fascinated by the more subtle beauty of city life, which one tends to overlook when caught up in its frantic pace.  \\"Witch Hunt\\" is a creepy minimalistic song about \\"ignorance, prejudice, and fear\\", and the danger of mob mentality.  (This is also probably one of the first Rush songs in which there are no solos.)  \\"Vital Signs\\", the closer, forces me to make an unfortunate comparison to The Police, of whom I have never been particularly fond.  The minimalism of this track is more robotic than the previous one, and therein lies its ominous feel.  Peart is uncommonly, but refreshingly, restrained on the drums, yet still every bit as effective.  Lifeson's staccato strumming shows an Andy Summers influence which is very fresh here, but upon which he was to become too reliant throughout the 80s.  Lee's voice naturally invites comparison to Sting, and the repetition at the end is also reminiscint of a Police song.  Still, I would rather listen to this song than anything by that other band.<br /><br />So what did Rush achieve with Moving Pictures?  They created the most solid album of their long career, and arguably their best (although Permanent Waves, when judged solely in terms of its best tracks, is possibly better).  Moving Pictures is concise and catchy without being compromied.  The band reigned in their excesses, and indulged without being indulgent.  Alex Lifeson's guitar was like a caged animal - ferocious but confined.  He proved that he could strut his stuff and still give his bandmates ample room to do the same (no small feat in a band like Rush).  Geddy Lee's voice settled into a more accommodating range.  Neil Peart's lyrics remained intelligent and literate without being too cryptic (heck, he even managed to get a bit personal).  This was the Rush album for rock fans who wanted to like Rush but who preferred no more than one 10-minute track per album.  Lee and Lifeson also made the most of a trademark they had been honing for some time:  while Lifeson soloed, Lee would play a bass motif or full-on solo underneath it.  Rather than simply doubling the guitar or playing the song's rhythm, Lee more than made up for the lack of a second guitarist.<br /><br />In the end, Moving Pictures can proudly stand as the singlemost convincing case for the success of a band who continues to chart new releases in the Top 10 and tour the biggest concert venues, all without gimmicks, Top 40 singles, or massive publicity campaigns.  It also proved that the band could soak up its influences without simply being derivative.  But since Geddy Lee is no Morrissey, Rush will always be a love 'em or hate 'em band.  And while some Rush naysayers do like it, Moving Pictures remains the best place to do either.<br /><br />(PS: Note that I described myself as a \\"recovering Rush fan\\".  This means that from age 14 or so - 1990 - until age 28 - last year - I was your typical Rush fanatic.  While I will continue to buy their new releases and go to their concerts, I am no longer the obsessed fan that I once was.  Also, note that I seem to mourn the loss of the muscular sound that Rush honed to perfection on this album.  While Rush has continued to record great stuff in the past two decades, none of their records has managed to sound, in terms of production and playing, as forceful as this one.  I guess that goes to show that, as the \\"Tom Sawyer\\" lyric says, \\"changes aren't permanent, but change is.\\")This is not quite as good as \\"Natural Science\\", but is very listener-friendly for and 11-minute song.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" is one of the best CD's I've ever heard, if not the best. With great guitar, drums and lyrics it is my favorite band ever. It cusses a lot but, it's almost covered up by how good the music is. Almost. the cussing's bad in American Idiot and dissing the US also, makes it pretty bad. I skip the song for that reason, sometimes. I don't really like the slow songs like Are we waiting or anything else I didn't review below.  American Idiot: good song but, the \\"F*ck America\\" sticks out like a sore thumb:8/10  Jesus of Suburbia: an good song but, too long I've never finished it, it gets too much attention:7/10                                 holiday: My favorite song on the CD. Great drums, lyrics,and guitar: 11/10  Boulevard of Broken Dreams: A great song. would be my favorite if it didn't cuss:11/10  Are we waiting: slow OK song: 6.5/10  Saint Jimmy: fast paced good song:8/10  She's a Rebel: A good song with great lyrics, I've memerized the lyrics:8/10  Letterbomb: a good song: 8/10  OVERALL GRADE: 9/10  all in all i would recommend this CD.
0060278250|5.0|The 'Abhorsen Trilogy' by the brilliant Garth Nix is possibly the finest trilogy of ya fantasy out there to this date.  Although, the trilogy crosses the borders of ordinary fantasy which makes the trilogy so unique and loved by millions.  Nix does bring magic to his characters and does it realistically which makes reading about Lirael, Sam, The Disreputable Dog, and Mogget, so enjoyable and believable.  The desperate mission to stop the Destroyer that Lirael must force upon herself, after only shortly finding out about her new inheritance (don't want to ruin it for anybody) and her companions was a non-stop adventure full of drama, laughter, and grim adventures into the death!  In this last volume, Nix finally reveals the true nature of the mysterious Mogget and the loveable Disreputable Dog.  It was a bittersweet read, knowing that this would be the last book in this wonderful trilogy, but Nix gives you an unbelievable novel which encompasses every element of an amazing story that belongs to the even more amazing Abhorsen Trilogy!  I can only help but wonder if Nix has another book planned by the ending he offers, and I would read that book in a heartbeat!  This is highly recommended.
0765310015|3.0|Good points: This is not a carbon copy D&D or Tolkien derived fantasy world.  There's plenty of action, and it's very rich and detailed.  Erikson knows his craft, and not only meshes the complex pieces together, but he's got a nice sense of prose as well.  Also, most of the major plot lines are wrapped up in the end---a major plus for those who've been burned by Jordan! <br /> <br />Bad points:  It's extremely confusing.  A factual book about the history of WWII or a new programming language can be dry and difficult to get through, but fiction is supposed to be entertainment.  Three hundred pages into this book, I still felt that I didn't have an idea as to what was going on, but I had so much invested by that point that I felt obligated to continue.  By the end, I had mostly figured it out, and if I read it again, I'd probably be astounded at how well everythign wrapped together. <br /> <br />That said, I won't read it again.  The main characters are world-weary murderers engaging in wholesale meaningless slaughter for no good reason----and those are the good guys.  There are only two somewhat interesting main characters, and they're not interesting enough for me to care about what happens to them in book two.  Some of the secondary characters are fascinating, but there are too many of them to keep them straight, much less care about their fates.  This is a major flaw in his work.  eg. there are almost a half dozen non-human races, but I never got a good sense of what any of them looked like. There were too many characters, and too many subplots, when what I wanted was a single good character and a single good plot. <br /> <br />Some people will love this book, and rave about how brilliantly it's written.  It is well written, but as entertainment, it's lacking.
0316172324|1.0|I do not understand why this book earned decent reviews. The people who gave this book 4-5 stars, are they real? or are they part of Marketing tricks nowadays. This book was the most naggingly-redundant book I've ever read, constantly repeating scenes and lessons like my mom would with her stories. I'm no expert, Im just the average Juan who wants a good read..and being average makes me wonder what is wrong with these \\"experts\\" giving it a thumbs up.  I could have bought a different book if it werent for these people giving it a good review. Just another tall tale, skip this one, it aint worth it. <br /> <br />
B000001Y2U|5.0|this is directed to that stupid kid, Brian Warner IS Marilyn Manson you ignorant waste, and this album does NOT suck. Go back to listening to Nsync...
B00009V7T2|5.0|A year or so ago i passed this album off because of its bizarre almost scary front cover and the lead singer Cedric Bixler's (of At the Drive In) intensely whiny voice, but it was a huge mistake. Ive broadened my musical taste much more since then and decided to try this amazing album, i wasnt disappointed. It takes a little getting used to due to the complexity and intensity of the songs, but if you set yourself some time to properly listen you will find a lot to fall for here. <br /> <br />This \\"genre\\" the Mars Volta have set is known as \\"math rock\\" to some people, others as just modern prog, but which ever way you percieve this album its certainly unlike anything you will ever have heard. A strange blend of amazing guitar work courtesy of Omar Rodriguez Lopez and mesmerising percussion all carried by Cedrics awesome vocal chords in a vessel of spaced out twisted production. Space rock is a commonly used phrase to describe this music but for me it doesnt seem to have that theme, its amazing how they've managed to make it sound retro and futuristic at the same time but thats the only way i can describe the vibe you get. Its no understatement that the 2 hispanic central members Omar and Cedric are nothing short of genius. <br /> <br />I'll try to run down the tracks and describe them as best i can: <br /> <br />Son Et Lumiere - A suitably atmospheric and beautifully spooky intro to the album that sets the tone and also acts as the calm before the mighty storm that is... <br /> <br />Inertiatic ESP - A single most people will recognise, very catchy chorus consisting of simply \\"im lost\\" repeated in various different yelps and screams accompanied by intense frantic guitar work, loud. <br /> <br />Roulette Dares - One of my favourite tracks, love the chorus and love the drums. <br /> <br />Tira Me a Las Aranas - Simply a bridge to the next track, and in my opinion the weakest track on the album despite only being a short skit. <br /> <br />Drunkship of Lanterns - A hitor miss track, i happen to love it along with the rest but some people dislike it, it has a fast chorus and can seem a bit strange, but then TMV are strange. <br /> <br />Eriatarka - Ok im dry, good song. <br /> <br />Cicatriz ESP - This song is easily my favourite on the album, beautifully executed it throws an awesome chorus at you then somehow loses itself and goes into its own dreamworld before warping out of its unconsciousness and blinding you with that same awesome chorus you heard 5 minutes ago with a strange sense of \\"ahhh thats it!\\". <br /> <br />This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed - Fast and frantic but also very backwards and off key, no real sense of melody here but exciting nontheless. <br /> <br />Televators - As far as i know the second single from the guys, consisting of a yellow tinged video starring a gremlin like creature. The slowest song on the album...infact practically the only slow song, very good and a welcome change of tempo...personally i think it would have been more effective as a halfway break point in the album. <br /> <br />Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt - Suitably trademark ending similar in nature to the first track, nice ending but leaves the album a little open? if that makes sense. <br /> <br />All in all if you are a fan of alternative music or are open minded at all..and like rock music, then you should take the dive with this, its rewarding. <br /> <br />10/10
B000003Z12|5.0|I am biased because I grew up as a big Journey fan but I am also now a big fan of jazz and or instrumental guitar music. This is an album that I literally listen to evey night as I am winding down. I can't say that about any other album. You don't have to be a Journey fan to like this album. There are very little similarities except for the guitarist Neal Schon who is I think one of the most underrated guitarists in music history. Neal can play anything any style as he goes from his signature cool laid back Jazz/blues rifts to a bit of flamenco strumming. There is a tribute song dedicated to the late great Wes Montgomery which is incredible. It is an album that you can sleep to but that will not put you to sleep musically. He plays some smokin solos but like the great guitarists it doesn't sound like a big rock solo that you might have to be in a rockin mood to hear. I listen to everything from Strunz and Farah (flamenco), to Satriani to Steve Morse to Eric Johnson to Craig Chicaucio (however you spell his name) and this one album is probably my favorite album from beginning to end. It's a masterpiece that I dont' think will be duplicated for quite some time. I've worn my copy out and am about to buy another.

By looking at the cover of the book, one may not be able to decipher what the cover depicts if one hasn't studied or read about the Chinese holocaust that occurred before World War II was officially declared in 1939.  One can only think that the picture depicts dead fish along the ground.  However, that is not the case, and it is the gruesome reality of what can happen in times of conflict.  The Japanese proceeded in creating havoc in Manchuria in December 1937 in order to attain territorial and imperialistic power over the Chinese.<br /><br />Chang's well-documented narrative of the Rape of Nanking is a powerful book that can either move you or make you think about  history that has already passed.  The Rape of Nanking is one of those events in history that has been debated and challenged by Japanese historians in telling the truth about Nanking by non-Japanese researchers or even those who actually lived through the experience.  Through Chang's narrative, she pleads to her readers that this event indeed happened and revisionists working to debunk the facts are working on a thin red line when they taint history in order to paint a \\"pretty\\" picture of their own history.  History is not complete unless the entire big picture is presented.<br /><br />The Rape of Nanking is indeed another piece of the puzzle in telling the history of World War II.  As more evidence is presented to what occurred before Pearl Harbor, there will be a better understanding to what eventually occurred on August 9, 1945 and after.  Those who read the book should be forewarned of the graphic narrative as well as the photographs.  Nonetheless, this is a highly recommended book.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|Rob Halford has to be the epitomy of a heavy-metal rock singer.  No one else can come close to Halford in belting out those high notes.  ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION showcases Halford's ongoing talents, and reforges the legendary British metal band called Judas Priest.  The best tracks on this disc are Demonizer, Hellrider, and Angel--which is hauntingly beautiful and finds Halford singing rather mellow!  Even though this album is nowhere near the greatest of TURBO, or some of their older classics, it is still a solid effort from a legendary metal band.  Welcome back, Halford!!!
B0007939NO|3.0|After seeing a breathtaking color dance number in the recent DVD release of That's Entertainment III, I was really looking forward to the 3/15/05 release of Brigadoon. While this new disc has sharper clarity thanks to the 16x9 transfer, someone has seen fit to reduce the color levels dramatically. Not only is the new pressing less vibrant than the 'Entertainment' clip, but noticably weaker than the older DVD. Note the grey heather on the hills! This marks the third try on DVD for this title. Here's hoping they get it right on HD!
B0001ZMWQO|2.0|some people will just believe anything the music critics say, this is way overhyped, and every song is the same basic tempo and dance structure.  <br /> <br />no, it's not good.
B000059H99|5.0|Rocky is a brilliant, wonderful and inspiring film.  I have never written a film review on Amazon before, but I just had to write one in this case.  As a young woman, I didn't think I was going to like Rocky.  As a general rule I hate boxing and turn away from violence on TV.  Yet Rocky was nothing like I thought it would be; it was no brutish, gratuitous celebration of violence but a tender, passionate, exciting tribute to following your dreams and your heart. <br /> <br />Everyone knows the outline of the plot by now.  Suffice to say that Rocky is a down-on-his luck fighter living in a squalid flat and feeling as if his life is wasted.  By pure luck he gets the chance to fight for the most coveted price in the boxing world.  He knows he can't win against his opponent, but he does know that if he digs deep and `goes the distance' in the fight then he will redeem himself once and for all. <br /> <br />The characters in this movie are fantastic.  It would have been easy for the character of Rocky to have be written as a cocky idiot, the kind of boxer who is all swagger and arrogance - and yet Rocky is nothing like this.  He talks aloud to his pets and is infatuated with a shy pet shop sales assistant (instead of the flashy, smart-talking blond that normally plays the love interest in this type of film).  Rocky doesn't even have the necessary cruelty in him to break a man's finger in his job as a debt-collector.  He does the most romantic things - such as shouting out `hi' to his girlfriend, Adrian, when he is interviewed on the news and shouting out her name repeatedly at the end of the fight scene. <br /> <br />Adrian could have been pigeonholed as the `girlfriend' with nothing more to do than slap Rocky on the back and cheer from the sidelines and yet her character brings so much more to the film.  As she and Rocky fall in love the movie blossoms into one of the most romantic I have ever seen.  In the scene at the ice rink and then when they are walking home you realise that they are absolutely perfect for one another (one has the body, the other the mind).  Afterwards, in Rocky's flat, the scene when they kiss is simply beautiful. <br /> <br />Overall the film Rocky has everything.  It has edge-of-the-seat fight scenes, romance and passion, truly deep characters and an ending so touching you want to step into the film and become part of it.  I would recommend this film to everyone, especially women who thought in the past that it would be too violent or too unemotional for them.  Go and watch this! <br /> <br />JoAnne <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|I was brosing the new releases and was presently suprise by the average customer review on this album. U2 is one of the most overated bands of all time. The main reason i do not like this band is because of bono. I cant stand the guy as a person and why does he have to sing every song like he is never going to sing again. Also why has no one said that that song vertigo is steroytping hispanics with his lame mock accent.
B000021YQV|2.0|Yes, System of a Down have made some great songs here on Toxicity, but they have also put out some garbage ones that make you wonder why they even consider these half way decent. The good songs are ones that you still here on the radio quite a bit so by now most people are probably tired of those songs anyway. Overall, the bad stuff heavily outways the good so unless you can get it for cheap I would stay clear.
B00006879E|5.0|This album really gets me rocking! \\"This Love\\" is one of my favorite all time songs. Worth every penny!
B00004Z400|5.0|Out of all the Deftones cds this could just be my favorite one. The songs have the perfect balance of screaming and mellow singing that people have to come to love about the Deftones over the years. You would be hard pressed to find a bad song on here and this is one of those cds that you can put in and listen to from start to finish. Overall, I highly recommend this if you are a Deftones fan or if you just want some good music.
0066214122|4.0|When Crichton's wrote his first thriller and best-seller,`Andromeda Strain', the critics and readers knew a new ingenious and engaging writer had made his debut.  Now, year after year,  Crichton continues to masterfully write impeccable researched books, that capture reader and transport them into a wonderful strange world.  A world that only a master storyteller could create.<br /><br />In \\"Prey\\" `nanotechnology' has come of age.  \\"Nanotechnology is the emerging field where extremely small machines, a billionths of a meter, exists to support science (and, of course the U.S. military).  Crichton does his best to explain this emerging field; but `nanotechnology' is so futuristic and complex that it derides those attempting to explain it, beyond the basic concept.<br /><br />In Prey, it will take you a serious stretch of the imagination to visualize swarms of escaped nanotech entities that hunt and kill their prey, using the decomposing flesh to manufacture more nanotechs.  All the while they are evolving at an exponential rate.  However, the nanotech are not invincible; rather a strong breeze will rendered them useless.  It did baffled me why, since these swarm entities could be defeated by a good industrial strength fan, no one thought of using an extension cord and the mother of all fans.  Hum.<br /><br />Many of Crichton's aficionados will recognize his usual writing elements: the powerful influence money has on science and what horrific outcomes can occur if technology's power is not respected (Jurassic Park); the secret and isolated facility in lock down (Andromeda Strain), the emasculated husband (Disclosure), and of course, the highly professional, but incongruous crew of people trying to survive against a powerful, menacing, unknown force (most of his stories).<br /><br /> One critic stated that Crichton has reached the autopilot state that Robert Ludlum did, churned out the same, same.  Not true, I found Crichton still very much alive and in the game.  He his scientific-writing edge is in top form.  Strongly recommended.in the game.  He his scientific-writing edge is in top form.  Strongly recommended.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|This is a neat album.  The Mars Volta has concocted a symphony seperated into movements.  There really isnt much radiofriendliness on here, so those of you without attention spans or appreciation for experimentation/straying from the norm probably wont dig it.  Still some really good stuff overall if you've got 20 minutes or so to listen to some of the tracks all the way through.  Oh and Flea plays the trumpet on a couple of the tracks, which is pretty sweet.
0688163173|2.0|I was disappointed by this book. A rave Wash. Post review hooked me: this would be a book about a fateful voyage to an insane-asylum island, where grim events would occur and long-buried secrets unearthed. Wow!<br /><br />And that's partially the plot on paper. But the actual book was a plod, became for me like a Zork text adventure: go to rooms, see people, solve a puzzle, go to the sea cliff, come back from the sea cliff...  Where's the horror? And when the grand design of the plot was revealed, my reaction wasn't Wow! It was Huh?
B000002IZ4|5.0|this album is pretty. track twelve is the best track since the reagan administration.
1558216847|5.0|Rather than wither away in a Siberian labor camp, stripped of all freedom and dignity, seven innocent men (and later one woman) make the trek of a life time to regain their freedom. After a year of suffering through the frigidity of Siberian blizzards, the blistering heat of the Gobi Desert, and an ill-equiped journey over the Himalayas, the men who survived won the most prized possession in life: freedom. Even after his journey, the author rejoins the Polish Army, placing him at risk of being in the same predicament again. How these men were treated, the hell they went through, and the glory of the prize is something a lot of people could learn from. Freedom is like most anything. The more you work for it, the more sacred it is. This book made me realize that nowadays there are many people born into freedom who will most likely never value it at all, and if lost would not even think about walking thousands of miles to regain it.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is such a fantastic cd!  I bought it the day it came out and have not at all been disappointed with it.  His first one was wonderful, and this one picks up right where he left off.  I personally love A Foggy Day (In London Town), I'm Feeling Good and Under My Skin.  These old classics done by the likes of Sinatra and Dean Martin are reworked by Buble in a vibrant manner.  If you haven't picked this easy listening gem up, do it now!!!  You will love it.
B00008WJBU|4.0|The premise of this film is that some people can steal luck from others. The idea is bizarre but interesting, and the director (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo) and some great actors managed to make a great movie out of it.<br /><br />The main character, Thomas (Leonardo Sbaraglia), the only survivor of a tragic crash that killed the other 236 passagers in the plane, is one of the \\"fortunate\\" people that can steal luck. He is not so fortunate, though, because he is arrested by the police while he is in a hospital recovering from the crash, due to the fact that he is a thief. Despite that, not all is lost for him.<br /><br />A strange man called Federico (Eusebio Poncela) helps him to escape, on the condition that Thomas will bet for him in a secret and very exclusive ring of betting, and that they will split the earnings. As a consequence, Thomas is introduced to to a secret society of \\"fortunate\\" people addicted to betting all kind of things in different games. The stakes are high: money, houses, people... The questionn is: how far is Thomas ready to go?.<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I highly enjoyed this movie, and that I recommend it to you. I have never seen a plot similar to this one. Whether that means that I don't watch enough movies, or that is an extremely original film, I don't know. All the same, watch it: you have nothing to lose, and a lot to gain  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B00027JYLC|5.0|I rented this on a whim one time...I never had heard of it.  It was so good!!  I don't know about scary but creepy for sure.  Good story/plot!  The characters/freaks are so wonderful in this movie!  This is one of my favorites now!
B000268QB2|5.0|...you bought a CD where there wasn't a weak track? We've all got them...the disc you bought for that one song or two, only to discover that those one or two songs were pretty much ALL that band had to offer at the time, and you're left with another 8 songs or so of filler? <br /> <br />There are a handful of albums out there that defy this paradigm.  You don't skip tracks because you don't WANT to skip tracks.  Hopes and Fears is the first album I've picked up in a long time where I can safely take my hand away from the \\"next track\\" button for about a half-hour or so.  Only a few other albums can hold my attention the way this album does and it's not because it's a particular sound (one is \\"The Way It Is\\" by Bruce Hornsby, another is \\"Afraid of Sunlight\\" by Marillion and still another is \\"Free\\" by Concrete Blonde). It's not because they're particularly  trendy, or because I'm fanatical about the band...it's simply because each track leaves you hungry and ready for the next one, and the next track does the exact same thing. <br /> <br />Are these guys geniuses? Are they going to save pop music? I don't know and I don't really care to know.  They've given me a set of songs I plan to to carry with me to my grave, and that's enough for me. Will the next album be as brilliant? Probably not, as this one's set a very high bar...but I'll definitely be around to find out if it is!  <br /> <br />Crafting a crappy pop song is easy...crafting a really good one takes talent.  Get this album.  It was easily the best one I bought last year.
B0007P3582|4.0|\\"The Massacre\\" is a great follow-up to \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\"  Even though it is not as good as his 7x debut, it seems like it is really consistent and different.  This time, 50 tried some new producers on his songs, which his last album Dr. Dre and Eminem basically produced the whole thing. The current single, \\"Candy Shop\\" produced by Scott Storch is by far the highlight of the album.  It is radio friendly, really sexual and features Olivia who stands out on the track, and in the video.  Other great songs include \\"This Is 50\\", \\"Piggy Bank\\",\\"Outta Control\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\", and \\"Just A Lil Bit.\\" There are some really good club type songs on this album as well as the usual hood talk and gun talk.  This album will go far like his last one did, and look out for Olivia, the FIRST LADY OF G-Unit in May or June. Her album is going to be even hotter!!!!
B000002NHN|5.0|There's no doubt that Loreena Mckennitt is probably one of the best known female artists in the celtic music genere today, and rightly so. \\"The Book Of Secrets\\", her last studio album, displays a rich tapestry of emotions and musical images that the listener will soon not forget. <br /> <br />This spellbinding album begins with the aptly titled \\"Prologue\\".  No words are sung.  Just a seductive, nearly addicting instrumental and Loreena's absolutely breathtaking voice humming along with the music.  <br /> <br />Next up is \\"The Mummers Dance\\", probably one of Loreena's most known songs, due to its airplay on commerical radio and its video being aired on VH1. Though I prefer that her appeal remain a bit of a mystery, I was glad to see that she got a bit of recognition by the mainstreaim and that non-Loreena fans were exposed to this talented artist. \\"Mummers\\" would dress in coustumes and dance to celebrate nature. <br /> <br />After the \\"upbeat\\" tone of The Mummers Dance, the pace is dramatically slowed for \\"Skellig\\",   named for the Skellig Islands in the Irish Sea.  The song, about the quest to be closer to God, has a powerful, spiritual feeling to it. <br /> <br />The tone is once again more upbeat for \\"Marco Polo\\".  Once again, no lyrics are sung.  Just an infectious melody and Loreena's stunning vocals. <br /> <br />at 10:19, \\"The Highwayman\\" is the longest song on \\"The Book of Secrets\\", and it is my personal favorite.  This abridged version of Alfred Noyes romantic yet tragic poem of the same title is memerizing. The song is so rich with detail and emotion, the listener will become so involved in \\"The Highwayman's\\" plight, that 10:19 really doesn't seem long enough!  Every time I listen to the song, as it ends, I feel I'm being startled out of an intense daydream. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"La Serenissima\\" is yet another instrumental, but unlike \\"Prolouge\\" and \\"Marco Polo\\"  There are no vocalizations at all.  The song invokes a sad yet peaceful feeling and is quite beautiful. <br /> <br />The tone once again is a bit upbeat and sensual for the romantic \\"Night Ride Across The Caucasus\\". I always have visions of a fair maiden taking a midnight ride with her sweetheart whenever I listen to it. <br /> <br />Closing out the album is the absolutely beautiful and haunting \\"Dante's Prayer\\" The song is about reaching out, hoping, praying that something greater than ourselves (God?) is there to take our hand and comfort us.  The last words Loreena sings on this album are \\"Please remember me\\". Its almost as if she is saying the words about herself to the listener.  She needn't worry, for her voice and this cd are simply unforgettable!
B0007TKNKG|4.0|This is a great movie and like someone said, it's ABOUT TIME it's available on DVD! It's a great father-son movie... too bad I have a daughter.
B000000OQY|5.0|this album is so underrated. It only had 1 hit but if people actually listened to the other songs they would think its great.<BR>The best song would probably be patience.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is a DVD that makes you think, the animation is so well done that it looks like paintings come to life. The movie was first shot in live action then re-animatied and it works so well with this movie. This movie is trippy and in spots funny, this is worth it and should be in any animation fan's collection
B00079FUI6|5.0|My wife and I are both excited that Desperate Housewives will be coming to DVD sooner then we originally had thought. When my wife first talked me into watching the premiere episode I was expecting another dull perdictable soap but instead was surprised by a wonderfully written show which keeps you wanting more. The only disappointment I have is that ABC keeps preempting the show and we are forced to go through withdrawl for several weeks at a time.
B00004VVN9|4.0|This is a classic Sci-Fi thriller movie tells a story if a hypothetic wonder technology is made real how good and bad would happen. I was a CS course student when I watched this at a movie theather in 1984 and was delightful to find this recently in local DVD store. Now mid 40s I rediscovered the charm of this movie. The most emotional sequence is the divorcing couple could finally share their loving memory with the help of reality device. The director might want to tell what really makes people happy. <br /> <br />The movie plot is a surprisingly modern and yet shows the age when it was pictured.  DEC, E&S and Gould, many other high-tech of 1981 have gone. The director knows well that cutting edge science research and technolgy field. The initial 10 minute sequence is enchanting. If you're a type of researcher and/or engineer, you would understand easier. I wonder the movie contains many jargons popular in '80 but I can not figure out since I'm not an American. Too bad we can not see anymore it at a theather in the original dual format screen play. It's made with all analog and is not a movie for LCD display.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Gives one a realistic view of how relationships change, how complex feelings are and how each one of us struggles to live an ideal life, falling far short.   People who didn't like \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" because there wasn't enough action, probably won't get this one either.  It's talking throughout the whole film, and very philosophical too.  The characters are trying to find themselves in a very busy and confusing world, and you find your self pulling for them, even with all of their imperfections.   <br /> <br />The ending is alittle unsettling.  There is no real sense of completion, but I'm sure they are setting us up for a PART THREE.   Fascinating dialogue from two very gifted actors.
B000002MP2|5.0|Whoever called Greenday 'Losers' are freaking shallow-minded stereotypes. This album, along with Internaional Superhits and American Idiot are works of perfection and genius. Greenday are different from any other band out. Dookie came out quite a few years ago now, this album is still one of Greenday's finest works. If you like Greenday you'll love this album. Also, have a look at their latest album - American Idiot; more political than the other albums, but has won a grammy for being 'Best Rock Album' this year.
B000002LQR|5.0|the best rhcp album and one of the best albums of all time!!Any fan of funk/rock should get this one. Its a listen through cd at a low price!
B000002H33|5.0|I've Read all 940 reveiws for this album before me, and was dumbfouned each time I read a one star one. This album is an intricate classic, the music is amazing. The solos in every song never seem repeated, and in the 8 minute song, you feel they are to short, you want it not to stop. Master of Puppets is a great song, you can see why it's the title track. Damage Inc. is such an angry song, ripping through the riffs and solo like there's no tommorow. Battery is such an energy charged song, I can't see how some morons call this deppression music. It makes me want to bounce up and down. I love this CD to death, it is the second best CD I own. The best is Rocket To Russia by the Ramones
B00005A0RI|5.0|I Love this album. Great playing - great sound.    I took it to the local Audiophile HiFi store to test out a valve amp that I wanted to buy. It got the attention of everyone in the store - their jaws just dropped. It sounds amazing. I bought the amp. And the speakers !!
B00028HBKM|2.0|To start, let me say that from what I have read in the reviews, there is a lot of hostility and name calling. We are rating a movie here not the actual religion. So please stop the fighting. <br /> <br />Although I'm not a Christian, I have great respect of Jesus Christ as a great prophet of God, messiah and a teacher. I love biblical stories, especially the stories of Moses and Jesus.  But this wasn't what I was looking for; the scenes with the Virgin Mary were perfectly done, and emotional. But the movie drags on with the physical torture of Jesus. Almost 99.9% of the film is comprised of torture and beating of Jesus, which I found genuinely distasteful.  What I would have liked to see is more about the teaching of Jesus, and why the Jews were so fixated on eliminating him from the scene.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, if your not a Christian then I don't see how you will relate to this movie, but if you believe in Jesus the messiah as a redeemer and his suffering led to the salvation of the human race, then this is totally the movie to buy. <br />
B0002SROSQ|5.0|I'm not sure whether to consider this an amazingly successful new incarnation of Nick Cave, or the perfect culmination of all his work to date.  It contains all the great riffs, anger and darkness of Murder Ballads plus all the smooth, insightful and moving lyricism of Boatman's Call and No More Shall We Part.  I used to think Nick Cave's early and later work was produced by two different people, both of whom just happened to be named Nick Cave.  In this album, those two people meld to form one beautiful whole.
B000000OQF|5.0|this is an amazing album! Axl's vocals are amazing and very unique. Steven Adlers drums are good and so are duff's bass and izzy's back up guitar. One of the reasons why this album stands out is because of SLASH!!! His guitar is one of the best ive ever heard and it is amazing to listen to. DEFINETELY BUY THIS ALBUM IT IS WORTH IT AND THE PRICE IS LOW!!!
B000021XS0|5.0|This CD is great. I heard the song \\"Home\\" on the internet iTunes metal express radio, which is the best. It seems like that is the only way to find underground metal that isn't death metal. Anyways, this CD has so many solos. They all are great. It is a concept album, much like Pink Floyd's The Wall. This tells the story about some guy named Nicholas who's girlfriend commited suicide. It is very sad, but the music is great. The tracks that don't sound that good are always short, just building up into the next rocking track. Overall, it get a 5 star, with Overture 1928 being the best track, and Reggression being the worst.
B0000047EC|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums. <br /> <br />It is quite special, and I have found that it has a universal appeal.   <br /> <br />The playing is beautiful, and the CD is sonically stunning. <br /> <br />Charlie Haden's bass sound is huge, too. <br />I recommend that you make this album part of your collection. <br />
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I love the matrix. BUT there was no need to make three parts, they could have fused reloded and revolutions in one part. <br />there is also alot of filler in this movie that is soo boring. but if you are a matrix fan then i recomend the dvd. <br />however if you just \\"liked\\" the matrix one and two then rent this one. <br />ps. i hate the pilot character. he ruined part 2 and 3 for me. i was realy close to buying a dvd burner so i could rip the dvd edit the scenes that he is in and remake the movie, but it was a waste of time.
B0000256VK|4.0|I don't think I will ever grow tired of this album. It has amazing staying power, considering how old it is. (80s) But maybe that's the mark of a classic. Classics just don't age, but like fine wine, are to be savored.<br /><br />My favorite cuts are \\"More Than This\\", \\"Take a Chance with Me\\", and the title song, \\"Avalon\\".<br /><br />One of the best ways to listen to this album, is to put the top down on the car, get out onto Highway 17 to Santa Cruz, CA, and just move into a sublime, blissful state of mind as you listen to the smooth vocals of Brian Ferry and the top-notch instrumental arrangements.<br /><br />If you somehow missed this one, give it a listen. You won't be sorry.
B00000JCOV|1.0|its just screaming and yelling. the instruments are good expecially the drums but the singing ruins it. horrible.
B00030590I|5.0|I saw \\"Hero\\" twice on its opening weekend in the states, and made sure to purchase a copy as soon as it was legally available. That's how strongly the film affected me. I was prepared to like it because I'd seen and enjoyed many films the cast (especially Jet Li) starred in. Yet, I was surprised at how much I loved the film. The fight scenes are stunningly choreographed, the cinematography is beautifully surreal, and the film's moral is an Eastern message undiluted for Western consumption. No single actor or artist involved with this film can truly be singled out for praise; \\"Hero\\" is a group effort and uniformly good. <br /> <br />I won't discuss the plot, because I do not want to spoil any of this movie for anyone. Suffice to say, this is a serious movie set in Ancient China. Do not watch this DVD hoping for Jackie Chan-style hijinks or you will be disappointed. Despite its many excellent action sequences this is not a standard action movie - every act of violence in this film, no matter how stylized, has a purpose and a consequence. Coming at the end of a summer with one thinly disguised superhero movie masqueraded as an action film after another, \\"Hero\\" was the payoff I'd been waiting all summer to see. <br /> <br />The extras on the DVD are minimal but worthwhile. There's a short documentary, some storyboards, and the option to view the film in English or French rather than Mandarin Chinese. (Those of you who hate subtitles will appreciate this.) There's also a nice, short conversation between Jet Li and Quentin Tarantino. It was Tarantino who lent his name to the film so that Miramax could release \\"Hero\\" theatrically in the US and not dubbed, hacked, and direct-to-DVD. I'm no Tarantino fan, but after the good he did helping \\"Hero\\" find an American audience, I'd do him a favor anytime.
B00008XESD|4.0|I have the Remastered CD (\\"Ultimate Blue Train\\"), the SACD and a heavy Vinyl LP of this. <br /> <br />Yes, the SACD DOES sound better than the CD (unless I am imagining things, which is entirely possible), but for me, the Vinyl wins hands down. Even though it has a few clicks and pops, I would rather hear the vinyl version any day. <br /> <br />I have done A-B-C comparisons, but have not as yet performed a double-blind ABX test so maybe I am imagining the difference, but who cares - the LP is more fun anyway ! <br />
B00007GZR5|3.0|...that indeed deserved its' Academy-award for the amazing special-effects that dominates the movie. Yes, visually it is fantastic, it is facinating and \\"dreamy\\" to watch (and becomes this way anything but boring) but the story however -well, the image of the life after death becomes chaos, the theory on hell (I realize this is no \\"religious\\"-movie, just imagination vaguely based on the faith in God) -but here in the afterlife everything is just as confusing as it is in the life on earth. The story offers no beliavable \\"attempts\\" of giving any answers, even in \\"Heaven\\" there is pain -and frustrations. The topic is real love. But real love does not save the couple (or the family) What Dreams May Come introduce us to. And frankly, the drama is nearly embarrassing -tragic after tragic, too much. And the ending, isn't \\"Heaven\\" a place worth staying? \\"No, let's do it all again -life after all was so fantastic!\\"    Silly story, fantastic picture! Recommended!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This film has given our family many hours of enertainment,mocking the characters lines and applying them to our own situations.  The lines are classic.  The deadpan,understated humor is so memorable and weird.  If you have been to highschool, you will recognize yourself or others in this nondiscript circa of time. It's a family film which teens and parents can watch and enjoy together.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Enough of the kids who expect every high school movie to be exactly like American Pie and Road Trip. Those kids will never be able to watch anything else. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is about the \\"life\\" of Napoleon, his goofy brother and friends. Its about how they live it and the simple craziness that goes on that makes this movie unbelievably funny. If you want to see that American Pie guy nutting in a beer cup, get something else.  <br /> <br />This is a movie for people who have matured from lame high school comedies about sex, beer and being an idiot to something with character and longevity. <br /> <br />\\"The best movie everrrrrrr\\"
B000056H7W|5.0|A while back, I needed to take a breather from the jazz scene - I thought I would do something totally different and venture into the prog rock/metal scene to see what was going on these days. <br /> <br />Right about then, this album was EXACTLY what I wanted to hear - mellow bits, aggressive bits, haunting lyrics, odd time signatures, interesting song structures, spooky imagery, pretty guitar sounds, devastating riffs. It's all there - thanks Opeth. <br /> <br />I was already accustomed to Cookie Monster vocals, having listened to Cynic years before, so the growling vocals did not scare me off. In fact, I found them to be a refreshing alternative to cheesy operatic vocals. I also liked the way the mellow bits reminded me of Pink Floyd.  <br />  <br />These guys are great. Go out and buy all their albums. You can get some of them on Vinyl, too. My favorites are Blackwater Park, Deliverance, Damnation and Still Life. I think this is their best album overall. <br /> <br />Also, Opeth's music led me to check out some other stuff too - Porcupine Tree, Devin Townsend etc. Thanks again for creating this great music, and showing me another branch of the tree to explore. <br />
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|\\"To Be Or Not to Be\\" falls under the rarified category of indispensible.  This film is ambitious and it succeeds on all levels it aims for.  It is a screwball comedy that is also a thrilling tale of the Polish resistance as well as a lampoon of the absurdly evil nature of the Third Reich.  Director Ernst Lubitsch and his collaborators successfully navigate all the intricate threads of this yarn.  Jack Benny, in his inimitable deadpan style, is a marvel as ham actor Josef Tura who utilizes his skills to infiltrate the Gestapo.  Carole Lombard, in her last film role, is alluring as Tura's wife Maria.  Another good comic turn by Sig Ruman as Colonel Erhardt.  The DVD also contains an amusing comedy short starring Benny that should not be missed.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Not only is this my first Dream Theater album, this is my first album review. <br />I felt that it was important to let others know how good they are. <br />If you like to hear good musicians practicing their craft with a heavy metal edge, then this album is for you. <br />It's all here: good vocals, deadly guitar, piano, synth and drums that will knock your socks off, all done exceptionally well. <br />If you like heavy technical music, give it a few listening sessions and you won't be disappointed. <br />Fortunately you have found this jewel online, since at about 10 min. per track I doubt you will ever hear it on radio. <br />I will be picking up a few of Dream Theater's other releases for sure. <br />To add a little flavor for your pallet, a few other bands in my cd player; <br />Rush, Yes, Tool, Metallica, Soundgarden, Pink Floyd, Queensryche. <br />Hope this gives you a feeling for the band. <br />Enjoy :-) <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|Intelligent lyrics, complicated song structures, beautiful melodies. This is without a doubt one of the greatest cds ever recorded, and the fact that it has only a 4.5 star rating is a complete travesty. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" was the first in the series of three absolutely mindblowing and innovative albums; \\"Ride the Lightning\\" (1984), \\"Master of Puppets\\" (1986), \\"...And Justice for All\\" (1988). Only Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin have recorded this much incredible music in such a short period of time. That is why it is so sad that their 90's music gets all of the airplay and the publicity. It's not bad, it's actually pretty good, but it's just not the same band.  <br /> <br />If you've never explored 80's metallica this is a good place to start... <br /> <br />1. Fight Fire With Fire - 10/10 - 'Tallica starts it off with the fastest track on the cd. Explosive riffs, cool lyrics. <br /> <br />2. Ride the Lightning - 10/10 - Written from the POV of a man on death row, the title track is a powerful one. One of Hammett's longest solos. <br /> <br />3. For Whom the Bell Tolls - 12/10 - Epic. This one has a great lead riff from Mr. Cliff Burton, definately one of the highlights on the disc. <br /> <br />4. Fade to Black - 12/10 - Well, Metallica went against the grain here and wrote a ballad. I guess you could say it turned out well...Fade to Black is quite possibly their best song. It begins slowly with beautiful acoustics and melodies and then finishes off with one of the greatest solos EVER written. Excellent lyrics too. <br /> <br />5. Trapped Under Ice - 8/10 - Not a bad tune, but a little subpar for this album. The bridge/solo are definately a plus. <br /> <br />6. Escape - 7/10 - James Hetfield despises this song, apparently the record company made them throw it on for a radio friendly song. Eh, it's not bad. <br /> <br />7. Creeping Death - 10/10 - Another classic, 2 excellent solos...nice and fast. <br /> <br />8. The Call of KTULU - 12/10 - Aaah yes, the epic closer.  People often overlook this song because it is in instrumental, but i really think it's one of their top 5 songs. This is a very chilling instrumental, i've really never heard anything that comes close to it. The s&m version is even better too! <br /> <br />OK. Get this ****ing album. If you don't pick up on the beauty of it first, give it a few more listens. You won't regret it.  <br /> <br />Also Recomended... <br /> <br />Master of Puppets <br />...And Justice for All <br /> <br />They're both as good, if not better than RTL.  <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|When I first got this album, I couldn't get past my initial impressions of it as simply boring techno. However, once I sat down and listened to it, I found that I LOVED it. It seems to just get better every time I listen to it. My two favorites were: #1: \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" and especially the melodic duet #4: \\"Nothing Better.\\" If you know what's good for you, go out and buy this album NOW!!!
B0007TKNCY|5.0|I consider myself a film buff but \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" was one of those films that slipped under my radar.  I was aware that a few years ago the AFI named it one of the top 100 American films but I just never got around to seeing it.  I am happy to report that Howard Hawks' film is deserved of the reputation it's procured.  The pacing of this film is breakneck and the laughs are so relentless that you barely get an opportunity to catch your breath.  Basically the principle stars Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are playing against type as a repressed paleontologist and a free-spirited heiress, respectively.  Hawks gives them the respect to allow them to fly without a net and the results are dynamic.  The film is akin to a live-action Warner Brothers cartoon.  The verbal sparring between Grant and Hepburn as well as the visual gags are just priceless.  This film demonstrates that comedy when done properly can be elevated to a high art form.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|My first listen made me immediately aware of the recycled lyrics. Many of them sound like they were taken as bits and pieces from previous recordings and put together in the hope that something would make some sense on this one. Needless to say, that didn`t work.  <br />Ok, it`s neat, of course, to have three guitars in a as technically demanding band as Iron Maiden, whose fame rests on guitar harmonies, but there`s nothing memorable about the alleged triple guitar attack here. In all songs, the third guitar is superflous and if they got rid of Jennick, they`d still be able to play the songs live the way they sound on CD. In fact, back in the days when they had only two guitar players, they were making highly complex CD`s that required at least three or four guitars for the songs to be played live the same way as on CD. Take \\"the Duellist\\" from Powerslave as an example. The rest of Powerslave, as well, features harmonies with at least two guitars. On DoD, however, most songs are missing the typical Maiden harmonies and the ones that are there, can be easily rendered live with only two guitars. Most of the time, it`s three guitars playing the same melody.  Speaking of harmonies, the harmony in \\"The Age of Innocence\\" is classic Maiden that makes me wanna cry. It sounds voluminous, spatious, and has the breadth that only harmonies from Seventh Son could compare to.  <br />Next, the sound on this CD is awful including the cover art work. The Maiden logo is slightly different and that, too, does its part in killing the magic that usually comes across from a Maiden CD cover. The sound of the record is muddled and Bruce`s voice could have been turned up in the mix. Adding some reverb to the voice would also have been a good idea, if one is to recreate the true sound of the band.   <br />Musically, the band sounds repetitive. Some songs like No More Lies try to recapture the old metal glory with Bruce`s siren vocals a la Seventh Son, but DoD is no Seveth Son and will neverbe. The songs are ok. The first time you listen to them, you`re thinking Maiden are back, but again, that feeling is very short lived and only the harmony on The Age of Innocence is something that will stay when everything else has faded away. Most songs are too stretched out. While one could argue that they sound complex, I think that they sound aimless and the guitar work a la Jennick Gers adds to the mediocrity. A few solos by Adrian are cool, but his style has changed, too, over the years. His solos have gotten faster, less thought-out, and less melodic. Plus, they sound kinda boring because they don`t have the climax the old solos used to have. If one only thinks what these guys could have done with three guitars. There could have been no limits and with a little more effort, we would have had another Somewhere in Time or Seventh Son. I know that many people think Brave New World is the superior album, but I have to say for the record that Brave New World also has many of the flaws of DoD. The songs are too long and boring, the harmonies missing (with the only exception of the title track), and the sound is too round and crystal clear for a band like Maiden. Maiden`s sound should be darker and the guitar chords must have that typical dark roaring sound that can be found on Seventh Son.  <br />The list of my complaints is too long to be mentioned in full here. To the people who think I sound too pessimistic and critical of my favorite band, all I can say that I think it`s time to say it like it is. I hope that Maiden will find their roots again and put out an album that is as well-balanced and self-contained as Seventh Son. It`s really not that difficult, so what are they waiting for?
B000050FEN|5.0|It's interesting watch Seven because it's quite depressing and bleak with none of that hope at the end of the tunnel hidden away somewhere. It's gritty and realistic. David Fincher manages to make a film with those qualities but without alienating the viewer which is quite a feat. I don't know many people who would watch such a dark film without it being too much so.<br /><br />Detective Somerset is literally 7 days away from retirement. He gets paired up with a new partner, Detective Mills. Their first assignment is a really fat guy who looks like he was fed to death. Somerset realizes that criminals don't take this long to do a murder, the murder has to have a meaning.<br /><br />Mills finds a 2nd body: a lawyer who's had a pound of flesh cut from him. The word Greed is written on the floor. Somerset returns to the fat guy's apartment and finds the word \\"Gluttony\\" in grease. A-ha! The killer's using the 7 deadly sins as basis for his murders: Envy, Pride, Lusy, Wrath, Sloth, Lust and Envy. He helps Mills in following the clues so that they can hopefully stop the killer before he completes his 7.<br /><br />Even on repeated viewings, the cat and mouse game they're involved with still seems interested as the killer is always one step ahead, leaving clues that tend to be a little less obvious, such as turning a painting upside down so that the detectives are clued in that there's fingerprints behind the painting.<br /><br />The 2 actors provide a nice counterbalance: Pitt as Mills is brash, abrasive and likes to swear a lot. Freeman as Somerset is very calm, knowledgable and neat. In one of the earlier scenes, Mills wakes up with kind of wrinkly looking clothes and a messy apartment while Somerset has everything ironed, straightened out and everything.<br /><br />As for the films near infamous ending it does come out of left field and isn't the most happiest. Which is quite nice in a film where something actually terrible happens instead of the cop who walks away with just a bullet in his leg while the rest of him emotionally and physically he's fine. The 2 main characters both walk away from this film feeling very affected by what happened.<br /><br />As for parents who are concerned over kiddies watching? Definately do not let them see this. The murders; while never seeing what happened they just show the aftermath of it, are quite violent and brutal. To detail an example: one victim is raped forcibly with a strap-on only the object in the end is quite sharp and knife-like. You don't see anything, you just see a picture, which makes your mind go into overdrive about how painful it must've been, which is a nice touch by Fincher. A lot of times our mind creates the worst imaginable if we can't know what exactly it was.<br /><br />It's a really great film if you're old enough. It's got action and a bit of humor and it's a film that likes to last with you whether you want it to or not.s away with just a bullet in his leg while the rest of him emotionally and physically he's fine.

0804106304|4.0|In a mixed race society, misunderstanding amongst different ethnicities occurs frequently. In her novel The Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan asks what happens when different generations of the same heritage misunderstand each other. Tan focuses on the stifling relationships between mothers and daughters from seemingly separate centuries. The driving wedge proves to be cultural. Tan questions the role of culture in individuality and whether one can choose to ignore her history. After reading this novel, one gains a new respect for history and ancestry. Using academic literary techniques such as symbolism and characterization, Tan presents a complimentary view on heavily culture-based societies. <br /> <br />Tan presents the generations as squaring off across polar universities. The mother generation came from a society of political and societal upheaval. The dictatorial Chinese power is turned upside down by Japanese insurgents. The mothers live solely for surviving with a modicum of dignity. They escape from a dangerous political regime-\\"America was where all my mother's hopes lay...after losing everything in China\\" (141), only to lose a definitive piece of their culture. The country is a melting pot of heritages, diluting each society to a dull broth. The daughters are of the selfish generation today. They view their Chinese history as a barrier, a road block to their dreams. All they see is the disappointment of their mothers. As Rose Hsu Jordan says, \\"After seeing my mother's disappointed face once again, something inside me began to die\\" (144). The daughters find solace from this disappointment in the secular culture. From the mothers' perspective, the daughters' behavior is cutting. Lindo Jong says, \\"I am ashamed. Because she is my daughter and I am proud of her, and I am her mother but she is not proud of me\\" (291). Both of these opinions push the generations to act. The mothers cling to their culture, the daughters shove it away. Tan portrays the mothers as embroiled to combat the secularized mellowness of American culture and the daughters as cult believers in American vanity. The purpose of the novel is to define how much culture can direct the actions of an individual. <br /> <br />Tan analyzes character and personality in culture. The determination given derives from both political and geographical roots. For the Chinese culture in the novel, \\"Once you are born Chinese, you cannot help but feel and think Chinese\\" (306). Tan distinguishes between a political and a geographical alliance to a society. The difference being one driven by fear or consequence versus one based on devotion and love. The mothers devote themselves to their Chinese background, but not to the country's rulers. These women connect because of a shared love for their culture. As Jing-Mei Woo describes of her mother, \\"My mother could sense that the women of these families also had unspeakable tragedies they had left behind in China and hopes they couldn't begin to express in their fragile English\\" (6), while tragedy brought them together culture united them. The mothers fear that this \\"joy-luck\\" culture will not pass on, \\"They are frightened. In me they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America...They see daughters who will bear grandchildren born without any connecting hope passed from generation to generation\\" (31).The daughters in the novel do not want to feel a connection to their ancestry. Yet, as Tan points out, a person cannot escape heritage. Culture need not be a shackle, however. As Lindo Jong says, \\"I made a promise to myself: I would always remember my parents' wishes, but I would never forget myself\\" (53). A person's culture can act as a flavorful spice in personality. Tan argues that the fact of culture does not denote eternal and absolute submission to an idea. <br /> <br />As a multi-cultural novel, The Joy Luck Club accomplishes in developing understanding of generational and cultural disparity. Tan's powerful use of symbolism creates a metaphor for cultural imprisonment-\\"The water heated up and the pot began to clatter with this crab trying to tap his way out of his own hot soup...screaming as he thrust one bright red claw out over the side of the bubbling pot\\" (226). By using insightful, contextual symbols, Tan invites the reader into the constrictive barriers of this culture. Writing from a Chinese heritage, Tan takes advantage of the cultural reliance on animal importance to cultivate depth in its intellectual meaning. Her imagery representing individuality is concrete and memorable, \\"She and I have shared the same body. There is a part of her mind that is a part of mine. But when she was born, she sprang from me like a slippery fish, and has been swimming away ever since\\" (274). The use of these symbols and imagery is divided between divergent viewpoints. As the novel shifts in perspective, Tan develops distinguishable character voices. If not for these constant voice cues, one might get lost in the ever-changing plot developments. Not only does this make the novel an easier and interesting read, but by doing so Tan directs the reader to shift viewpoints from character to character. Each character contributes a new facet to this culture-based society. There is a distinctive generational separation on the view of cultural responsibilities. This musical-chair narration adds to the idea of generational and cultural diversity. Tan's wielding of literary tools carves out a masterpiece of twentieth century literature. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Tan wants the reader to see that a person can remain selective of her culture without rejecting the entire heritage. Writing on the same idea, David Henry Hwang's Golden Child conversely argues that there is no compromise between eastern and western ideals. Unlike Hwang, Tan incorporates character evolution to accomplish a balance of the conflicting societies. For instance, Tan allows a character to declare in one moment, \\"My mother and I spoke two different languages...I talked to her in English, she answered back in Chinese\\" (23) and then to say, \\"My mother was right. I am becoming Chinese\\" (306). Even the women of stringent cultural heritage undergo a change in the novel. The practical use of character progression forges new opportunities for Tan. Without it, her position would be inarguable. Humanity is ever changing and cultures transform-making it easier to balance cultural responsibility and individuality. <br /> <br />Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club is a study of maternal relationships and cultural influence. Her use of literary elements argues that culture is meant to be a joy, not a burden. Tan succeeded in educating this generation in its filial responsibilities. <br />

B000002AP1|5.0|I'm unfamiliar with the David Bowie mix of Raw Power, but I can safely say that this album is awesome. I mean that literally. You will be in awe after listening to first few minutes of this music. Yes it's loud, but it's supposed to be loud! It is not unlistenable to at normal volume levels. If anything, it's unlistenable to at low volumes. The Stooges MUST be loud! That's the whole f***ing punk ethos! After listening to just the first three tracks of this, I fell in love with The Stooges, as I'm sure any of you will, if you have any appreciation for some hard rock. Even if you usually don't dig punk, this is somewhat of a far cry from what would be considered punk by the late 70s. It is very guitar-oriented.

0316776963|5.0|I couldn't dislike this book if I tried.  Upon completion, I find myself flipping back through essays, re-reading over and over again finding little details that I missed before and laughing out lout in inappropriate situations.  Sedaris is so likeable and undeniably funny that it might take a while before you start questioning how this dry, often pestamistic passive observer became the protagonist of his stories for no obvious reasons and became your personal hero.  He's not really criticizing human behavior, he's just admitting that no one is above it and for being a writer with such wit and charm stripped down to confessionals, you can't help but love him for writing the words that never left your mouth with such cleverness and fluency.  \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the collected writings of David Sedaris' experiences in France and that general era of his life, but instead of being filled with the hopelessness and drama he was searching for, he manages to find whimsical humor everywhere he goes, never failing to display his own pretentions and akward mannerisms to which I relate and praise him for.  Even though I have yet to meet an eccentric bipolar french-teacher who constantly throws objects and asks questions purely for the intent of criticizing thier answers, a father who refuses to not eat appaulingly old food and forces his children to appreciate jazz, or a speech therapist who seems to interrigate her child patients determined to find flaws in thier speech, I'll never lose my appreciation for those great story tellers who'm I've never had the privelege to be.  Sedaris and his world full of eccentric characters, never fail to entertain.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Kevin smith is one of the best directors out. But, \\"Jersey girl\\" ruined his career. But, his first movie was the one that got him in the business. I'm talking about \\"Clerks.\\" This movie is very good. One of the best independent films of the 90's.  <br />This movie has his friends just having a blast in front of the camera. Nobody expected this movie to come out to be famous. If you guys do not have this movie, please buy it. you'll love it. I'll finish this with a quote from the movie: \\"37?\\"
B00009RGBS|4.0|'Chicago' is the movie of a musical style in jazz, so it attracted me for that reason at first time. After I enjoyed the movie, I realized it contains the serious plot and theme. 'Chicago' shows that the society overflows with crime nowadays. In this movie, two female jazz singer want to acquire fame even by murdering someone. They take advantage of being prisoners, and pretend to be pitiful making up a party with their lawyer who wants only money. Finally, they win reputation on their own stage. <br />     The movie contains many of splendor scenes. Because the musical 'Chicago' is adapted for the screen successfully, it makes me very exciting and dynamic. The excellent background music and the jazz tune flows on the screen attractively. <br />     Although the music and scene look beautiful, the conclusion of this movie teaches us something immoral. The plot that two offenders get fame has an bad influence on the audience because the movie beautifies the crime in fact.  <br />     I recommend this movie to the person who loves the music, especially jazz, because of the excellent music and performance in this movie like seeing an excellent musical.  <br />
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|I just recently checked this CD out after reading all the hype on the internet and in magazines about this band and I was blown away.  This band is musically as tight as any death metal band I've ever heard.  Great guitars, punishing drums, and those twisted evil volcals make Demigod a must have.  Not many bands that play this punishing brand of death metal can break into classical guitar and make it work. Fans of Decapitated, Morbid Angel, Nile and bands of that nature will not be disapointed.
B000002UAR|5.0|At first glance, Revolver appears simply to be an excellent Beatles album, nothing more. But why then do many hail it as the greatest album produced in the history of rock? One word: influence. The reason it seems normal is because we, especially those like me who weren't alive in the sixties or seventies, are used to orchestras and sound effects, distortion and sitars incorporated into rock. This normality came about, for the most part, because of this album.  <br />  <br />I have always hated the fact that I missed the golden age of rock, and because of this I can only imagine the impact this record would've had on me in 1966. The seconds before the first song containing sounds of shuffling and then a monotone, dreamy voice counting off, \\"One...two...three...four,\\" as the band launches into \\"Taxman.\\" Your mind is blown today, nearly four decades later. Then the ghostly strings of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" begin, and you find that your mouth is open.  <br />  <br />Throughout the album, this feeling of awe persists, and you can't help but think how the devil four British dudes could make such a huge impact on culture. Could they have possibly known how much of a deal this album would be? Doubt it. Will anyone ever achieve the greatness of this album again? Certainly not. The Beatles went on to make much more ambitious albums, (Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road) but ambition, in this case doesn't equal better. Since then, every sound from the Caribbean to the Eastern Asia has been reaped and incorporated into rock music. When Revolver was made, no one in the western world had ever even heard a sitar, and here you listen to George Harrison using it as fluently and skillfully as his guitar, no sweat. (By the way, how about a hand for George, he is killer on this album!) But I wouldn't consider it an extremely \\"experimental\\" album, because the sounds are incorporated so naturally and effortlessly. Still retained are the catchy pop melodies, but everything else about pop is blown away.  <br />  <br />Even in the midst of this might-as-well-be-chaos-in-the-hands-of-a-lesser-band, the Beatles, and the production crew, I'm sure, maintain the 3-minute pop structure, which is ironic. The sounds are so far-out that you would think that it would take them half an hour or so just to achieve the mood on one song. They do it in two or three minutes. Amazing. <br />  <br />How can all this be achieved in 40 minutes? Quite frankly, I have no idea. I don't think that anyone does or ever will, including Paul McCartney himself. I prefer a little mystery with my music, though.   <br />

It's a different movie. And I won't take a movie with FX of today and haircuts from the 70s. The Empire Strikes Back is the one I like most. Thank God this one has not been mutilated. For me all the other movies of the saga have become extras I have included on my Empire dvd box (they hardly fit). The same goes for Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|How can I start this review? This movie is SO GOOD. WAY better than the grudge. This movie has a great cast, great action, plus VIOLENCE. This movie will make you think from the beginning to the end. I will bet anybody that you will not guess the ending. so stop reading this and purchase this film.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|In the insipid, vapid world of popular music that was the mid-late 90's, people were desperately hoping for musical saviors to arrive and wisk them away from the likes of Everclear and Dave Matthews.  Sure, there was always indie, but most of these talented artists (Neutral Milk Hotel, Built to Spill, and Elliot Smith to name a few) are horded by those in the know and, unfortunately for most people, they are never known outside of close-knit circles.  Then came At the Drive-In's Relationship of Command and I was convinced the world would never be the same.  This was not merely math-rock.  Relationship of Command sounded like Fugazi on an lsd\steroid cocktail binge and they were great.  Alas, At the Drive-In came like a megaton shotgun blast and went from our consciousness with a whimper.<br /><br />Have you ever wished that, one day, a band would come along that satisfied each and every one of your eclectic musical tastes?  A band that could seamlessly meld hardcore, classic rock, the pretensions of prog and electronica into a dark psychedelic brew that was uniquely their own?  I had been looking for such a band for twenty years when I first heard Mars Volta's debut EP, Tremulant.<br /><br />Fast forward three years into the future:  Frances the Mute crushes Tremulant and De-loused in terms of artistry. If artistry and substance are important to you when choosing the music you listen to then look no further: Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez are your saviors.  Influences are abundant, especially King Crimson and Robert Fripp, who Frances' epic closer, Cassandra Gemini, owes much to.<br /><br />I must admit that I was such an At the Drive-In mark at the time of its release that I gave 2002's Tremluant overly high marks when in fact it was little more than a 3 1/2 - 4 star sampler of things to come. I wanted to believe in Tremulant because I wanted my favorite band to continue on despite the fact that I knew At the Drive-In were splintered in two. Mostly, however, I bought into the hype and wanted the Mars Volta to save rock music.<br /><br />De-Loused was a revelation, shattering everything At the Drive-In had built while exposing Omar to be a true musical prodigy. Until I heard the debut LP, I always thought of Omar as the driving force behind a very good emo-core band but I never knew he was capable of creating music on De-Loused's level. Frances continues this trend and builds upon Omar's solo release, A Manual Dexterity, using it as a sort of blueprint as opposed to the, dare I say, more commercial De-Loused. This is a challenging album, as difficult penetrate as Tool's Lateralus. But like Lateralus and other progressive albums in the same vein, the true reward comes with the fourth or fifth listen, when the tiles of sound come together to form a mosaic. I'm still trying to get through it in it's entirety, but it gets easier and increasingly fun with each attempt.  This is the magic of music and if you understand this, you will come to love Frances and be thankful that the Mars Volta even exist.
B00028HBKC|3.0|I went to catholic school and I have read the bible a few times over the years (although not recently).  To me, the story of Jesus Christ is that of a life-affirming humanitarian who inspired others and set a wonderful example for how people can live their lives.  The story ends violently for Christ, as the power structure of his time necessarily made an example of him and taught others the consequences of his ideas and actions.  It is a lesson for those who want to challenge conventions (even in a peaceful manner).   <br /> <br />That being said, the whole idea of the crucifiction as the defining moment in the life of Christ seems odd to me as someone who is familiar with the story.  I'm not suggesting that Mel Gibson sees it this way, because I wouldn't know.  However, the fact is he deemed it important enough to make a movie based only on this moment of Christ's life.  It also seems strange to me that an institution that claims to be <br />celebrating the life of Christ tends to focus so much on his crucifiction by depicting him dead or dying on the cross as the centrepiece of most catholic church ceremonies (aka: \\"celebrations of life\\").  I like what Lenny Bruce said: \\"If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses\\".   <br /> <br />So I guess Mel Gibson's film doesn't really misrepresent the practices of catholocism as some suggest; instead, it misrepresents the life of Jesus as it is described in the Bible.  Mel must be a Catholic to have made this movie, not someone with an interest in the life of Jesus Christ.   <br /> <br />What concerns me the most is that people paid to see this movie.  Your review/opinion means nothing if you have already paid to see/own it. Today's system of power and control over the masses is largely economic in nature, and the people who fund these kinds of movies measure the opinions of their <br />audience in terms of what they pay for, not what they think. Your negative review of this film does not matter if you have <br />already paid to see it.  If you are trying to influence others not to rent or buy this movie, you shouldn't have paid for it yourself in the first place; as those who look to reviews for movie advice are likely to rent what sells most anyways.  For those of you who are religious and liked this movie, good for you! You are free to like it, and free to do as you're told.  If any Catholics out there are offended by these statements, don't feel like you have to write a reply; just forgive me...as I assume Jesus would have.   <br />
B00005JLKN|4.0|I can't add too much to the other reviews here: all of which, I must say, are very interesting, and from a great variety of perspectives and artistic sensitivities. However, I'd like to contribute something a bit different.<br /><br />My favorite parts of all the \\"Lecter\\" movies, and the books, are the various conversations that Hannibal Lechter has with those he interacts with. Case in point: in Red Dragon, the Lechter / Graham conversations, while appearing like a fireside chat between James Dean and Aleister Crowley hinted at brilliant insights that Lechter possessed.  When Will Graham first visited Lechter in his cell. Lechter alluded to his imagination which was what they had in common and what separated them from the other \\"poor dullards\\", and told him that \\"fear is the price of our instrument. It takes experience to master it\\".<br /><br />Demented as he is, Lechter mastered his own fears and faced unflinchingly the consequences of all his actions. How many of us can honestly say the same thing?<br /><br />That alone is worth taking the time to watch the film.
0060977493|5.0|For those who criticize it for not providing an accurate or comprehensive portrait of the entire country of India- that's simply not the point.  Visit the country yourself, or read up on the history, religions, and cultures of Kerala (or whatever other area interests you).  <br /> <br />Roy is more concerned with exploring the nature of human brutality than with providing Westerners an insight into Kerala.  This larger goal will surely keep Roy's novel relevant and engaging for decades to come. <br /> <br />The God of Small Things explores the consequences of what happens when the darker side of history- violence, subjugation, efficiency- are revealed to an underage audience. <br /> <br />It is an important novel, and written in dazzling prose- a world in every sentence.  Roy's use of repetition and poetic strategies (the paragraphs beg to be spoken aloud- watch what happens when you allow that to happen!) creates the effect of a lullaby that couches a story at once violent, grieving, explicit, and somehow calming.
1593072937|5.0|If Quentin Tarantino made comic books I am sure that they would be a lot like Sin City. This comic is ultra violent, lurid, and explicit. <br /> <br />The story is about a rough barfly by the name of Marv. After having a passionate one night stand with a woman named Goldie he finds her dead. Now Marv has a reason to live, his reason is to find Goldie's killer and paint Basin City red with the blood of anyone who stands in his way (trust me, it is a lot of blood). This graphic novel puts black and white to good use and it is an awesome addition to anyone (except for kids) comic collection. Bes usre to check out other comics including A Dame to Kill For, That Yellow Bastard, The Big Fat Kill, Hell and Back, Family Values, and Broads, Booze and Bullets. <br /> <br />Trust me, you won't regret it.
B000002LND|4.0|I going to be honest, I like 80's music better than now. Although I find Madonna skanky, I love her songs. Her pop music is the best. I don't like those crazy wannabes like Britney and Christina (at least now I don't...). If you are desperate to get away from the lame, over-sexualized pop music like Britney's, go listen to Madonna.
6305079811|5.0|Don't buy from online scammers. This DVD will be re-released in the fall of 2005!!!! Cheaper that these clowns sell them for!
B000000WCA|5.0|I remember as a little kid, I loved the Spice Girls. I had two dolls (Sporty and Posh), CD's, stickers, and posters. Heck, my cousin's friend did my hair like Scary's! Anyways, a friend of mine gave me this CD, and I loved it! All the songs are great, especially \\"If U Can't Dance\\" (*SIDE NOTE* The beat was taken from an old rap song in the 80's). If you are still a Spice Girls fan, this one's for you!
0385510454|1.0|I was a big Grisham fan for his first several books.  I have been very disappointed in his last few books.  The plots are fairly predictable and he tends to rush the plot when he has written so many pages.  I feel Grisham's books have lost their passion and freshness.  I plan to look elsewhere for my suspense novels.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this cd is awsome!! buy it!! i command you!! <br />this cd is full of songs that will make you want to go outside and tell people to buy this cd. Alot of people say that green day has turned more poop then punk. For those of you i say This CD IS FULL OF ANTHEMS NOT NORMAL SONGS!! so rethink what youve done and go to your room and think about what you've done because your grounded for a month. But seriously this cd is great and i would recommend that you buy it for yourself or for a friend. if you have a kid they will love it and so will you the cd may have some cusses but hey if its about Bush being an idiot who really cares? so go out and buy it have fun listen to let your kid/friend listen to it and have a good time
B0000062GK|5.0|Wheter you are a JS fan like me or not, you will fully enjoy this album, if you like any kind of rock music. For me this is the best album of Joe. There isn't even a single note that will disturb you, this is totally a masterpiece,can only be done by a master like JS and must be appreciated by the music lovers by purchasing the album. Have fun with it.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|There are numerous films that portray the theme of love through various subjects. I had watched 'Cast Away' recently, which gave me a chance to think about what love is in reality, not as in a fiction. This film portrays the message of what true love is by adopting airplane crash as its subject.  <br /> <br />This film overshows a lot of moments where Tom Hanks overcomes tough situations for survival after being isolated in an island. For instance, he learns to make fire from bare woods and leaves that eventually enabled him to sleep at night for 4 years. His adventure scenes however, are not simply designed for attracting audience only. The camera captures the photo of Tom's wife from time to time especially when he goes to bed, which indirectly implies how Tom could potentially go through fighting against a nature. I believe that such a desparate faith for a single lover would have a profound impact on young couples these days, where 'love for a single person'seems to be falling apart.  <br /> <br />I would like to recommend this film to couples around me who are facing hard time with their lover. By realizing how important it is to be faithful at the right time when couples are together, they would successfully handle their problems for sure.  <br /> <br />'Cast Away' is a film that chose a quite modern subject to portray the message of love nowadays. It's a great movie I want to recommend not only because of its visual entertainment, but also the message it holds behind.
B000063DHK|5.0|I actually traded a buddy of mine a couple of \\"men's magazines\\" for the original vinyl record when I was thirteen and just starting to play bass guitar. This was the first rock record I had ever heard where the bass was actually mixed up front and audible... I pretended to be sick for two weeks so that I could stay home from school and practice along with it. Seventeen years later, I still get the most intense rush from listening to it-- the energy is just astonishing. I can't listen to Maiden's studio albums anymore-- they're just too cheesy for me to actually sit through-- but this one deserves a place on my shelf because it is just so amazing. I never get sick of it. If you're any kind of Iron Maiden fan, you should already own and worship this album. Conversely, if you've never heard their music (were you born under a rock?), this will spoil you rotten and you'll probably never like any of the rest of their stuff. I like how someone called this the \\"live best-of compilation\\". To my mind, that is entirely accurate.... I just can't recommend this album highly enough. Five stars.
B0006J28KU|1.0|The extras on 2nd disc are really not that special. Those 11 deleted scenes would not have made any significant impact of the story line at all. I own the original DVD release and because Heat is my all time fav movie I went and bought the double DVD special edition, otherwise I would not have wasted money. Picture and sound is not improved in any way but if you're looking for good commentary from the director get the special edition.<br /><br />Movie gets 5 STARS, the Special Edition gets 1 (and I am being generous with 1)
0807219533|5.0|This is my first Jonathan Stroud book - I was delighted. The trilogoy namesake, Bartimaeus, is a \\"djinni\\", subject to the control of the magician who can summon him.  The surprise is that the magician who summons him, Nathaniel, is a mere child, who hasn't even been given his official magician name yet - VERY UNUSUAL.  <br />     The Bartimaeus character is marvelously created, sarcastic, wise, more sarcastic, talented, more sarcastic, relatively powerful, more sarcastic, ...... and really quite hilarious.   <br />     The story is told from two viewpoints ... Bartimaeus's and Nathaniel's ....... somehow Nathaniel, (Harry Potterish) comes out to be the hero of this book despite the \\"Bartimaeus\\" name to the trilogy.  BUT, the ever sarcastic, even malevolent Bartimaeus, ultimately shows himself to be an loyal and protective friend to Nathaniel...... a very nice underlying twist to the story..... the ever sarcastic djinni always blameing his magical curse forcing him to act to protect Nathaniel... when it is ultimately his own true character which makes him act so. <br />     THE READER OF THIS BOOK DOES AN ABOVE AVERAGE READING and is able to present the story quite well.  I am just purchasing the second book in this series and am looking forward to it very much.   <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|5.0|The assasin character is greatly developed in this flick, could care less about the taxi driver. Typical Mann movie; dark, powerful, and the atmosphere makes you recall Heat (especially the nightclub shoot-out scene, wish there was more of it). If you already own couple Mann movies add this one to your collection, it is definitely worthy of my collection.
B0006U4UAU|1.0|Ok I too heard all the hype for this album.  Ok there are 2 catchy songs \\"Too Much Love\\" and \\"Great Release\\", but other than that this album is one of the worst I heard this year, if not ever.  this guy has no talent besides putting loops together.  His mono-tone voice is like listening to nails on a chalk-board, too nasal to flow with the attempted smoothness of the songs on this album.  I have a feeling this guy is succesful simply because people listened to his songs because they were new, and swear up and down this is the new face of music.  If this is the new face of music I might as well shoot myself now!
B0002IU988|4.0|Let's hope that the rumors of the possible re-union remains just a rumor. I like the line up just fine. Sure MT likes so show boat a little on the lead, but Watch Your Words justifies that. This is a power rock band that plays power rock and power ballads without missing a beat. I'm looking forward to the next Alter Bridge cd. Not the Creed re-union cd.
0805076476|3.0|It astonishes me to read the many reviews that give this book five stars and virtually refer to it as a masterpiece.  \\"War and Peace\\" it is not, although \\"Fight Club\\" is certainly fast-paced, unique and intriguing.  However, Palahniuk's point appears to be to lash out at society in general, and specifically at \\"the man,\\" in that his book is a violent, disturbing and subversive novel about conformity, and the apparent male need to pummel each other on a regular basis.  <br /> <br />     What possible satirical device is Palahniuk using by telling the reader how to make nitro-glycerin, or how easy it is for a waiter to get away with urinating in food served to patrons?  From his introduction, Palahniuk appears proud that young men, influenced by his book, are starting fight clubs all over the country. <br /> <br />     Obviously, the book has a great deal of resonance with many people.  I have to admit that it kept me turning pages.  However, I question Palahniuk's motivation in writing it, and just hope that people treat it as a satirical work, and not as a \\"how to\\" book.
B0006213WG|4.0|Being the president of a music assication that caters to mostly metal and power rock it's always a pleasure to hear bands that have slowly changed over the years.  Sum 41 and Lit carried the torch but Lit slipped and Sum 41 has obviously been taking steroids (that's a joke, they don't play baseball). But seriously, they've entered the punk/metal arena full force without forgetting their roots.  I enjoyed this cd emmencely and recommend to all my metal friends.
0385720920|2.0|I am one of the few people that did not love \\"Fight Club,\\" though I found it to be unique and intriguing.  In \\"Choke,\\" you basically find the same Palahniuk formula: terse quirky writing; a main character who has serious problems and despises society (but has the ability to influence those around him), and off-beat disenfranchised side characters.  I really could not find any redeeming quality in Victor Mancini, though I appreciated that he was less violent than the narrator in \\"Fight Club.\\"         Palahniuk certainly writes in an an idiosyncratic voice, and can dream up some bizarre scenarios.  I just don't think he is all that great a writer, and this book isn't terribly interesting.  Perhaps in a future work, Palahniuk will finally include even one character who isn't quite so loathsome or insane, as everyone is in \\"Choke\\" (and in \\"Fight Club,\\" for that matter).
B00005JL0U|5.0|I was about 3 when this came out and Michael's music and dancing is one of the main reasons I became a performer.  This mix of clips and then short film is somehting that will always be magical, and it shows Michael at his best. <br />This movie should have come out on DVD a long time ago.  I hope that it will be released soon.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. I don't care about those people that say it's too \\"mushy\\" or \\"cheesy\\" because it is an incredible film. James Cameron is a brilliant director. Kate Winslet's portrayal of Rose Dewitt-Bukater, the \\"poor little rich girl,\\" is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio also delivers an amazing performance. Celine Dion's song \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is a touching addition and I couldn't even imagine this movie without it. I watch a lot of movies and this one is still and always will be my favorite!!
B0007P3582|3.0|all this buzz and anxiety created over 50's sophmore release will come to a crash landing when u put the disc in your player.i don't know how 50 could say this album is 10 times better than his solid debut \\"get rich or die tryin\\".i think he took his track \\"a baltimore love thing\\" so seriously that not only was he heroin on that track but he took it while he was creatin this album.the diss track \\"piggy bank\\" ain't no \\"ether\\" or \\"takeover\\" because if i was kiss,joey crack,shyne or nas,i would have laughed quite honestly.they were cheap shots jus placed there to create a bigger buzz to increase album sales...(and it worked).the aggressive lyrics and flow which he had in his 1st album are not as present in this massacre album.there are quite a few commercial [...]on this album to take away from the album being a \\"massacre\\".for example \\"candy shop\\",\\"build you up\\" and \\"so amazing\\".stand out tracks...\\"i'm supposed to die tonight\\",the creative,yet attempted already \\"a baltimore love thing\\" and the club banger \\"disco inferno\\".the other tracks on the massacre are not bad,but they are far from blazin fire.however,due to the great marketing scheme interscope has,and 50 bein associated with dre and eminem,this album is gonna sell which is quite sad actually.if you all really wanna hear a rapper wit creativity,mad flow and lyrical skillz,check out that grand hustle playa T.I.whether it be \\"i'm serious\\",\\"trap muzik\\" or the latest release \\"urban legend\\",trust me,u gonna get consistent fire.one!

B0002IU988|4.0|When this album first come out I was expecting to <br />hear LOTS of Creed. I'm glad to say that isn't the <br />case... Sure you can hear bits and pieces of Creed <br />every now and then, but overall this album showcases <br />Mark Tremonti really well and shows his potential  <br />without Scott Stapp. <br /> <br />The best songs IMO are: Watch Your Words, Metalingus, <br />Open Your Eyes and Find The Real. One Day Remains is <br />also a pretty good song, but it's a notch below the <br />ones I listed above. There are 2 fillers or so here <br />such as: In Loving Memory and Shed My Skin. My favorite <br />is Watch Your Words because Mark kicks @ss in the <br />opening. I think he will be a Rock n Roll Hall of <br />Famer one day.
B000006FH5|5.0|A great movie from 1978 , about the Marvel comics superhero. Faced with the destruction of their planet Kryptonite, Jor-El (Marlon Brando) and his wife Lara  (Susannah York) send their infant son to the planet earth, where he is found by a childless elderly couple in Kansas. Growing up as a curiosity, by the name of Clark Kent, with superhuman strength, he becomes a reporter, who at times metamorphosis's into Superman. But nobody knows that Clark Kent is Superman. Though not even Superman's sweetheart, Lois Lane (a fresh faced Margo Kidder) knows that Kent is Superman.<br /><br />Anyway it is up to Superman in this adventure to foil the evil plans of the mastermind criminal Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to destroy California. Generally thrillingly done, with a lighthearted feel through most of it, and it is noteworthy that they play a part of the 1977 hit by Supertramp, `Give a Little Bit'. It was a bit silly though when Superman flew around the Earth several times to reverse time. Couldn't he have just rescued Lois Lane to begin with. Other than that well worth seeing again.

B0000AQS6R|4.0|After watching this year after year with my brother-in-law, it seemed just perfect that he gave me my own copy of the DVD when I went out to live on my own!  How excited I was to sit down one night with dinner and this movie, to listen to what I thought would be a tremendous commentary on the movie's background, technical features and trivia. <br /> <br />Not so.  First off, there were a lot of people talking on the commentary track, so many that I couldn't keep track of who was saying what.  Then, the content was definitely nothing special.  It seemed almost like they didn't know what to say, so they just filled it up with comments about Beverly D'Angelo's hair or other stupid things.  Plus, since this commentary track was obviously added long after the movie was made, most of the people involved had forgotten most of what it was like to make the film. <br /> <br />I also think that this film deserved a few better extras than just the commentary track.  Any outtakes or deleted scenes out there?  How about even a few bios of the cast and crew, especially since this was an early film for many actors who went on to bigger and better things?   <br /> <br />Now, the movie itself . . . a Christmas classic, of course.  My family watches it yearly around Thanksgiving, and my brother-in-law and I actually quote Randy Quaid throughout the year to one another.  We love the humor because, in each one of these characters, we find someone that we know in our own family. <br /> <br />Because it is such a beloved family movie of ours, I have to give it at least four stars.  Like many other people here have said . . . if you don't own a copy of the movie yet, go ahead and grab one.  If you do have a copy, you aren't missing much.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow, Christina sang the heck out of this album!  She has grown up to not only have a phenomenal voice that hypnotises and soothes you, but her songwriting has really improved.  You go girl :)<br /><br />The song \\"Impossible\\" brings 2 of the best female artists of this generation together in 1 song.  Gimme more Christina and Alicia Keys.
1563899426|1.0|This seems to be the latest book, following Planetary and League of Extraordinary Gentleman, that uses pop culture characters that we are all familiar with who's copyrights have either passed or never existed.  Now, instead of turn of the century Victorian Science Fiction characters and analogs of pulp novel men and Godzilla, we get the wonderful and fantastic world of fairy tales.  All them adorable scamps and brutish rouges from our childhood all living together in a New York apartment building.  Seem interesting enough.  It isn't.  We're introduced to this wacky and wondrous world of Disney sorts with the never-fail story type of a murder mystery, that, quiet frankly, fails in totality.    Of the short review that will soon follow, I will only give two story points as I do not wish to go over the whole of the book, but this is the forewarning of SPOILERS here, so take note if you were hoping to avoid them.  The story reads like stereo instructions as it appears to have no soul and plugs on at a tedious and almost mechanical pace.  The story is the death of Rose Red who is Snow White's sister with loose morals.  Snow is the current head hauncho of the fairy tale ilk, and though she and her sister disagreed on most things, she still wants her sister's killer found.  This task is left up to Bigby, the big bad wolf now in human form, whose our gruff, constable apparent off to solve the mystery.  At no point is the investigation interesting or engaging, but is rather just an excuse to introduce us to the current incarnations of fairy tales most memorable all-stars, none of whom are all that interesting either.  Everyone comes off as quite dull and very much like cliched Soap Opera characters.  Its as if the writer thought it'd be interesting to infuse the Brother's Grimm with Days Of Our Lives.  The only character actually given any real meat to their, well, character is Bigby, but for all his bitter, disheveled, chain smoking, unshaven-nous, he just comes of as a generic John Constantine with lycanthropy.  Now for the two story points.  I only point these out because they typified everything bad about this book.  See, when Rose Red was killed, all that was left was a bloody mess that covered the whole of her apartment's living room, but no body.  Now, the inquiries done by Bigby lead us from boring interview to boring interview that show reasons why this person or that person might want her dead, none of which are all that convincing or interesting, but the number one point in this story that can only be described as dumb is when Ol' Bigby actually tries to do some forensic work.  See, the human body only holds so much blood (I believe the number given is 8 pints).  Nevermind that humans vary in size, mind you, every human body holds exactly 8 pints of blood.  The writer assures us of this.  So Bigby gets himself a clever idea.  He gets 8 pints of blood and an apartment thats exactly the same size and with the same furnishings, then tells two hapless idiots to paint up this apartment to look the exact same and if they use more than 8 pints, then they'll know that the murder was staged.  Never mind the 8000 variables that could alter the two rooms blood stainings, the simplest being depth of pooling and that they'll never be able to get it the exact same.   I hold the mediocrity of this to be self evident.  If you just read the above plot point and didn't shake your head and let out a small groan, then maybe you would actually like this book.  But, if you function off of more than just your brainstem, then you see my point.  The second plot point that I will give away is that of the shocking twist ending (DUN DUN DUN).  See, I was reading this in the same room as my friend who read it previous to me and I put the book down right before the last part and said \\"she's not dead, is she?\\"  \\"What?  How'd you guess that?\\"  \\"Because it's the lamest thing they could possibly do.  It'd be the `shocking twist' the clever writer would hit his audience with just to show how one-step ahead he is.\\"  Yep.  She ain't dead.  All of it was for naught.  There was some reason that her and her lover forged it all, but it escapes me as it wasn't very memorable.  But you read some hundred plus pages of why the harlot was offed just to have the pleasant status quo realigned in Fairy Tale world.  The characters seem to give off a horrid \\"that Rose Red.  She got us,\\" kind of \\"aw shucks\\" moment and you almost expect them to laugh in unison like at the end of Super Friends.  Its pretty bad.  The fact that this book is lauded by many just reassures me of the entropic state of comics.  In a world where people pat this poorly conceived slop on the back and throw its name around with the likes of Watchmen just lends more to the argument that comics are a dying artform and, largely, the only one's left reading them are the diehards who'd applaud anything just for being a comic.  There are still good works out there being published.  Read Planetary, 100 Bullets, Hellboy, Hellblazer, Goon and (loathe as I am to admit it) Daredevil.  But if you have any respect for yourself as a comic fan, or even just respect for your collection, don't bring down its total value by adding this crap to it.
076790382X|5.0|This man is hysterically funny.  It's a series of columns about life in America after being away for 20 years.  There's some formula to his humor but let me know when you come across someone more funny more consistently for as many years.  I weep with chuckles and laughter all the way through.  My favorite paragraph in this book, which I point out to anyone passing by, is his invented \\"Fool your body ...\\" diet where you \\"... ruthlessly starve yourself ...\\" for 20 out of 24 hours in each day, then ... Well, you can read the rest.  By this point in the book my cheeks were soaked with tears from laughter.  I can assure you that it only takes 5 minutes of knowing me and out of the blue I will ask, have you read Bill Bryson?  He's terribly funny, and off I go quoting passages.  I'm giving him five stars because the book delivers.  I also would like to mention the clever book design and illustrations within.  The designer and illustrator obviously have read the book and they get it.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend, what more can be said.  He indeed will become a legend.  With his smooth delivery and soulful voice his music is almost soothing to your spirit.  I heard him speak in an interview saying that his album dealt with relationships, and not just the ones with happy endings.  He explores love and relationships from many different angles, which is not to say that other artists have not done this but when he puts it to music and applies his own unique lush soulful tones to it, the songs become something of beauty.  From Let's Get Lifted on into She Don't Have To Know I Can Change with Ordinary People and rounding out with Stay With You and Let's Get Lifted Again.  I have to say that So High is my absolute favorite, followed closely by Refuge (When It's Cold Outside).  I am intensely enjoying this album, I have listened to it constantly for the last 3 weeks and have not tired of it yet.  I will continue to enjoy and look forward to many more.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Like most, I knew that Phil Spector had smarmed up the original release of Let It Be, but I wasn't prepared for the impact of hearing the album as it was originally intended. Hallelujah! The improvements in this new version go far beyond the elimination of obvious schmaltz [...]. With Spector's overproduction removed, the music seems paradoxically to gain in depth, breath, sophistication, and emotional impact; it's as if an overpowering reek of cheap perfume had been blown away to reveal the complex scents of a natural bouquet.    Thanks to the improved arrangements, a great mix, and the use of more dynamic takes, the individual cuts on this new Let It Be are by turns rocking, soulful, sloppy, psychedelic, hypnotic, tender and ecstatic. You can hear for the first time all the great ideas that, for 35 years, have been hidden in sonic slush. And without the distracting studio chatter, with the superfluous unfinished numbers gone, and with tracks reordered so that, for example, the hard-hitting \\"Get Back\\" replaces the inspid \\"Two of Us\\" at the start, \\"Let It Be\\" now has some of the symphonic impact that makes a late Beatles album so much more than the sum of its amiable parts.    Remixed or not, Let It Be isn't Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road, and those who like the more finished sound and studio perfection of those albums may be disappointed that the new version retains some of the unevenness, roughness and lapses of a live performance. But that, after all, was the band's original intention, to recapture the dynamism of a concert, and with that intention honored, one can appreciate for the first time just how magnificently the Beatles took advantage of the opportunities it afforded. Which is to say that, rather than being odd man out, a monument to their incipient breakup and the Beatles album that had some good songs on it but wasn't up to the others, Let It Be can at last be seen as an artistic statement in its own right, as an album that can proudly take its place with its illustrious peers. Listening to it is almost like discovering a new Beatles album, and that doesn't happen every day.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I was highly anticipating this album. I was hurt to say to my brother, that this was no good. When I heard it the first time, i was ready to give it a 1 star. The singles were annoying and some of the songs had to grow on me. Lil Bit should have been a single and some other songs are really good, but not enough. Many of the songs that deserves to be skipped in your CD player. Really disappointed, hopefully he can bounce back before these other kats in \\"Piggy Bank\\" eat him up. The Game is sick though, go cop The Documentary if you dont have it yet
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I LOVED this film, and I am counting down the days until it is available in Australia! <br /> <br />One thing that I would like to mention that in the review by S. E Kautzman \\"wizardoz30\\", it is stated that the make up effects are not consistent-that the phantom originally has a normal hairline and when his mask is taken off he has hardly any hair. This is not a continuity mistake. I thought it was when I first saw it, but after seeing it 7 times, I noticed what actually happens. In the scene before 'Don Juan' where the Phantom is singing: \\"I hate to cut the fun short, but the joke's wearing thin, let my opera begin\\", if you look in the bottom left corner of the screen you will see a wig on a dummy head (he is also fiddling with his hair as you would with a wig). And in 'Don Juan' when Christine takes of the mask, you can actually see the wig falling off.  <br /> <br />But I totally agree with what the other positive reviews all have to say... it is a fantastic film, and I think more powerful than the original version.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux's voice conveys so many emotions on this album.  She hypnotizes the listener with her beautiful voice.  The piano playing by Larry Goldings is a perfect compliment to her voice on all these tracks.  I know that most of these songs were originally performed by other singers, but Madeleine has the ability with her incredible voice to make  these songs her own.  One of my favorite tracks is the song Dance Me To the End of Love.  I felt like I was floating on air while  listening to this song.  It has a very romantic quality.  I think this song  also has a deeper meaning that we should savor our time on earth because life is short.  Another standout track on this album is the song Don't Wait Too Long.  This song is performed in a lively swing style.  It is an original composition written by Peyroux and songwriter Jesse Harris.  Listeners can relate to the lyrics of this song because of how true it is to life.  The message of this song is that sometimes people have to hit rock bottom to realize what is important in life.  You're Going To Make Lonesome When You Go is a song that just puts me in a great mood.  I love the smoothness in Madelenie's voice and the poetic images of nature on this track.  French is such a sensual sounding language.  Peyroux displays the beauty of it on the song J'ai Deux Amours.  This song was performed by a singer named Josephine Baker and sung to soldiers during World War II to inspire them to come home safely.<br /><br />Careless Love is an album that has increased my appreciation for  classic jazz music.  The title track  is a song with timeless lyrics about how someone we love can drive us crazy.  This song made me feel happy and sad at the same time.  Not too many songs can do that for me.  Weary Blues From Waiting is a song that perfectly conveys the loneliness one feels when waiting for a loved one to return to them.  I really felt a sense of yearning in Madelenie's voice on this track.  It is so good.  I really enjoyed this CD.  I just hope that I don't have to wait so long to hear from this talented singer again.ly enjoyed this CD.  I just hope that I don't have to wait so long to hear from this talented singer again. <br /> <br />
B000055ZDT|5.0|If you've never heard EW before you probably think this is slow, grinding, dismal doom metal. Wrong! It's doomy all right, and it can be slow and grinding. But dismal? Forget it! This is the most fun you could ever have. Like Black Sabbath Vol 4, it's the sound of a band truly enjoying themselves, regardless of the overall mood of the compositions. And like Vol 4, it's actually groovy. There's a punky energy that takes your breath away. Dopethrone is one of those rare records that makes you laugh out loud the first time you hear it, because it's just so damn good. <br /> <br />The recording has a wonderfully fat, crunchy sound (which admittedly won't be to everyone's taste).  There are psychedelic elements, but on this record EW never let themselves simply wig out, which they are guilty of on some other records -- notably Supercoven, which sounds uncannily like Monster Magnet's 25...Tab. I've heard Dopethrone described as sludgy, but to me it has that fizzing crispness that you get on the best Black Sabbath and Melvins records. Inevitably though if you tune your instruments down about twelve octaves you're going to lose some clarity! <br /> <br />If you've any interest in rock music, let alone metal, you should get Dopethrone. As far as I'm concerned it's one of the best heavy records I've ever heard.
B000063V8T|5.0|This is a great season, but caveat emptor on the Asian versions.  Back in December there were some for $35/season, advertised as new Asian releases. (I got seasons 4 and 5).  The last episode on each disc gets cut off a little over half way through!  Can you think of anything more frustrating than being in the middle of a great episode you've never seen before and have it end before the conflict is even resolved?  Be wary!  I don't see any that cheap now, but sometimes it's worth paying full price from a legitimate source.
B000002JSZ|4.0|AC/DC is a great band, no question about it.  When you think of their great albums, you think of Back in Black, Powerage, and High Voltage.  Flick of the Switch is not in that league, but...Flick of the Switch is still a great album.  The thing about AC/DC is that they are such a good band that most of their albums are good, even their bad ones.  My friend and I always thought that Flick of the Switch was one of the best kept secrets in rock and roll, along with Aerosmith's Draw the Line and The Who's Who by Numbers.  All had no big hits and sales for these albums were par at best.  Just give them all a listen and you'll agree.  Some fine, rock tunes.  Enjoy them all... <br />
0316666343|1.0|The book called 'the lovely bones' was given to me with a recommendation to read it. on a long jet plane flight across the ocean, i finished the whole thing because i had nothing else to do. had there been a good movie, or for that matter, had i taken another book, i would not have wasted any time on this one. i found it to be boring, pretentious, irrelevant, far fetched. the idea of having someone murdered and following their observations from heaven is a very interesting one. imagine all the things one would uncover... with this plot, sebold could have given us enormous insight into the characters' lives. contrasting what susie was allowed to see when she was alive to what she sees now that she has unlimited acces could have made a fine story. unfortunately, this book gives no insight about anything. the scene where dead susie slips into ruth's body to make love to ray is more than rediculous. the way the mother deals with the death of her child and the emotional problems ensuing are far fetched and hard to understand. there is no mention about how any of this makes susie feel. susie, who is in heaven and who is a teenager who speaks like an adult. no. terrible book. the more i think about it the less i like it. the message sebold tries to incorporate in the very end does not come across at all. therefore, i must deem this book a failure and a waste of time.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I knew Rammstein would produce another great album, as all their other ones were works of art. Reise Reise is a great cd from beginning to end and flows well between song transitions. My personal favourites from the album would be Reise Reise, Mein Teil, Moskau and Ohne Dich.<br />I'd HIGHLY recommend buying the other Rammstein cds. This one goes into different music genres at times.. but cds like Sehnsucht and Herzeleid are very raw and heavy throughout. I'd recommend Mutter as well, as it has several singles on it (5)and is quite amazing to listen to over and over again. Rest assured that you will not get tired of these cds. Also try the Live Aus Berlin cd... it will get you head banging guaranteed. <br />If Reise Reise is your introduction to this band, you will be astounded at how great their previous works are as well. This band always delivers and gives you your money's worth. It is impossible for me to distinguish a favourite album of theirs.. but I assure you that all of them are in my top 10 favourite metal cds of all time. There's something for everyone.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I would love to review this film. I have been checking Amazon for 5 years awaiting a european release. This is THE Si-Fi classic - why isn't it available in Europe and the rest of the world? <br /> <br />Whoever releases this DVD - please, PLEASE release it world-wide.
B00005JNEW|4.0|I had to write a review of Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS for the Rutgers University New Brunswick newspaper, the Daily Targum, and I think, by giving it a lukewarm review, I might have underrated it a little. <br /> <br />In my newspaper review, I had complained about a lack of character development in the movie, saying that I didn't really feel deeply involved in these characters as perhaps I should have. And when you watch FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, you might feel a similar kind of emotional distance. By the final game, I wasn't really rooting for the Permian High Panthers to win; instead, I felt more like one of the spectators, objectively and dispassionately watching an event unfold. I admit, I was left a little cold by the movie at first. <br /> <br />But, thinking about it since writing that review, I think I've come to appreciate its strengths much more strongly. FRIDAY NIGHTS LIGHTS is less about football, and maybe even less about its individual characters, than it is in portraying, with searing authenticity, how an economically-depressed small town like Odessa, Texas puts all their hopes and dreams on their high school football team. Thus, there are many scenes that have only the barest wisp of a connection to football, but instead show some of the individual players living their own lives. Don Billingsley, for instance, has to deal with an occasionally abusive drunkard father (played by Tim McGraw, in a surprisingly effective performance) who tells him straight out that if he and his team doesn't win the championship, there's not much left to look forward to in Odessa. And then there is the poor coach, Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), who has to deal with similar kinds of pressure from nearly a whole town. Scenes like the one in which Coach Gaines is stopped by some rude townspeople in front of a shopping mall all vividly show a town that has become so attached to their high school football team that their reasons for living---at least in Odessa---become tied to the team. That is what FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about, and the way Peter Berg explores their subject---the sometimes-brutal character scenes, the vivid realism, the slightly washed-out quality to the film's colors that seem to comment on the town's loneliness---gives the movie a disturbing quality that goes far beyond the usual feel-good sports movie. (And the ending of this story is much more emotionally complex than is usual in these kinds of movies.) <br /> <br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS may not be a great movie, but it is definitely about something much more than just football. It's about how desperate people can project their hopes and dreams on something even as trivial as high school football. Despite my misgivings about the way the moviemakers approached the characters in the film, I think overall FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is worth a look. Recommended.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The director's cut of Donnie Darko serves to further amplify a film which alternately puzzled and enthralled moviegoers.  Not much of a commercial success in the US, the film did very well overseas, and this is spotlighted in the documentary portion of the second disk, which interviews fans in the UK in 2004.  The actual film is fleshed out by an extra 20 minutes of footage, mostly explanatory passages that clear some of the ambiguity surrounding Roberta Sparrow and her book.  These extra scenes, however, do not detract from the sense of never knowing whether the film actually deals with time travel or the hallucinations of a schizophrenic main character.  This, coupled with the many genre-crossing elements of the file, are what make it a modern classic.  There are scenes which look like an update of The Breakfast Club, complete with 80's pop music (including a new track by INXS); science fiction, involving complicated theories of time travel which actually correspond with modern thought on complexity theory; spiritual allegory, with Donnie cast as a messianic figure sacrificing himself to save the world; and coming of age drama complete with first love and rebellion.  Through all of this, director Richard Kelly never speaks down to his audience, giving them nothing they can't figure out on their own.  At the time of the theatrical release, the website was a marvel, giving tantalizing clues to the origins of the story and the thoughts behind the characters.  The bonus materials touch on this only a little.  Perhaps the most interesting feature on the second disk is a \\"Darkumentary\\" film by a young man who explains why he is the film's #1 fan.  This film veers from a laughable portrait of the kind of person who attends Star Trek conventions to a slightly creepy painting of an obsessed fan who ambushes minor actors from the movie to ask them rambling questions about the film's philosophy. He even gets the director's phone number from the Internet, leaving long messages with questions about the fictitious book on time travel. <br />    The movie itself is a brilliant piece of work, and I think that the extra scenes are positive more than negative.  They add to the story, and don't detract from the sense of alienation and mystery.  The extras are mostly enjoyable, although I hope that the filmmaker who cornered Mr Kelly at the San Diego Comicon is taking his medication.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I really tried to like this movie. After turning it off the first time because it was unwatchable, i came back a few days later to try watching it again. But this movie is just a failure. It tries to be quirky and witty, but it fails miserably.  The acting is not really acting, its just monotone reading of lines. That would be fine with me - and even acceptable as an eccentricity - but there are just no redeeming qualities to make you accept its shortcomings. It offers no insights into how that geeky crowd lives, nor does it resonate if you were that geek.  It is an MTV picture, and it really shows - this movie tries too hard and comes up short.  Instead of wasting your money on this dog, go watch Rushmore again, or Garden State.
B000000WF0|5.0|Here I am once again having a few beers, and for some reason I drink to this CD more than I do any other CDs...but don't get all weirded out because when I am perfectly sober this CD makes perfect sense to me. \\"I hope you see what I see, yeaaah yeah...I hope you feel what I feel, yeaah yeah!\\" Don't tell me these lyrics aren't passionate. 'Bittersweet Symphony' opens the album with flying colors and 'Lucky Man' and 'These Drugs Don't Work' shows the audience that not just one or two songs on the CD show the heights of the record, but the ablum as a whole is on an unsurpassed level of genius, and good music. Words will not describe, only the music will...and it's as simple as that. All this coming from a 19 year old from the states, anyone should understand what british rock is all about after hearing just the first few songs off this album. I would truthfully pay triple what it retails for, just to have it in my collection.
0385336810|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours...and mostly at night when I was supposed to be going to bed!  Fantasic story,  a heroine you find yourself feeling for, cheering for, and caring about.  No stupid graphical romance stuff...just acute storytelling, and you can put yourself in this story.
B000001FDK|5.0|Grease is a great movie and has great music. It has some new recordings of 1950's music and has good 1970's music in it as well. If you like the 70's and 50's this is a must, and if you like dancing/comedy/old school movies the movie and the CD are a must, guaranteed.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I don't want to build this movie up too much because I have a few friends who, unfortunately for them, do not like it or understand why other people LOVE it.  It is definitely not your average mainstream comedy.  You need to go into this movie knowing that it is not the same kind of funny as \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" or some other popular funny movie, hence the reason it was not popular upon its release.        That being said, this is the one movie that I never get sick of watching.  Never.  The characters, and I mean ALL of the characters, are excellent here, most of all John Goodman.  I love the Coen Brothers' movies because the acting in them is almost always superb and characters act in a very realistic, life-like way. But this one takes the cake.  Like other reviewers have said, the dialogue in this movie is hilarious.  Not only that, but it is ingenious.  On multiple viewings, you start to notice the little things that the characters do that make it that much funnier (like Walter's facial expressions in the bowling alley when he and The Dude are arguing).  I can understand why not everyone would like this movie. It does get a little weird in parts.  For instance, there are some dream sequences that, as I have witnessed, make people leave and quit watching the movie.  This is not because they are gruesome or malicious, but because they are a little hallucinagenic (is this even a word?) or \\"out there\\" I guess you could say.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes great acting, very well-developed characters, and an overall great movie experience.  I would not recommend it to anyone who is offended by abundant bad language and a little nudity.  Also Recommended: Fargo, Bad Santa, This is Spinal Tap, and The Royal Tenenbaums
B0007O38F8|4.0|THIS IS NOT GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN', NOR WILL IT EVER BE GET RICH OR DIE TRYING.

Listen to this CD at least three times before you judge it. And judge it for yourself. don't listen to any of us.
B00005JN0T|3.0|This movie is The Terminator times 1000.  Will Smith does a good job  as the action hero, but the plot is lacking.  Visually I, Robot is a great movie, but it is the story line that is lacking.  The movie never really answers the question, just what do we do when our own creations become almost as smart as we are?

0385512058|4.0|It seems like much of the efficacy of Ferrazzi's tactics lies in blurring the distinction between the personal and the professional connections.  Not even church-going remains sacred.<br /><br />At what point does a close-knit network become more invaluable than acquaintanceships struck during in-flight snackbreaks?  Are 500 people willing to answer your calls (after the umpteenth time you've attempted to ambush them on the phone during their off hours) really an asset?  Readers should keep in mind that one will not be able to fool all of the people all of the time with false pretenses of friendship.  Ferrazzi's work would be more effective if he differentiated between intensities of friendship and the tactics most appropriate for each.<br /><br />Further difficulties include:<br />-Networking Plan of Action (unfortunately acronymed NAP) includes scarcely a page of information about how to construct one.<br />-The arguments are often internally inconsistent:  receiving an invitation to a 15 min coffee break is an affront, while sending one tops the personal arsenal list.  Katharine Graham is eulogized as a champion of both \\"somebodies\\" and \\"nobodies.\\"  Yet Ferrazzi's lists of \\"people he'd like to meet\\" and his incessant extolling of the virtues of name-dropping seems to indicate \\"nobodies\\" are nobodies in his book.  Finally, the distinction between a \\"networking jerk\\" and commendable behavior is, at best, subtle.<br />-For an individual so concerned with connectedness, it is curious that a bibliography or appendix of suggested reading is entirely absent.<br /><br />May I suggest:<br />*How to Win Friends and Influence People: soft skills development<br />*Big Fish (a novel of \\"mythic proportions\\" by Daniel Wallace): a more sympathetic view on spin, for contemplating your own self-marketing plan or why Ferrazzi really left Deloitte.<br />*The Tipping Point: Chapter 2 is a more rigorous exploration of the roles the uber-connected play in social networks.
B00064MW6A|1.0|There was absolutely *nothing* believable or credible about this film. At times, Berry as Catwoman was dark - even when fighting her love interest, Benjamin Bratt. Why in the world would she be trying to hurt him? I understand that he was trying to arrest her, but there were better ways for her to escape than by knocking him around. I'm sorry, but donning that mask doesn't change her personality, any more than when Batman puts his mask on his personality changes. Bruce Wayne IS Batman, in suit or out. <br /> <br />Given the films we've seen lately (for example, Spider-Man, 1 or 2), the special effects were heinous. When Catwoman was bounding from wall to wall it you could see the generated effects, and you're not supposed to. Again, especially not today. When Sharon stone fell, at one point in her fall you could actually see that it wasn't a person - it looked like Raggedy Ann dressed in white. <br /> <br />To have a successful movie that involves a comic book hero, you need a good villain, a good plot, and something to care about. This had none of the aforementioned. The villain was a company and it's male C.E.O. trying to market a product that could potentially scar women for life (and what a ridiculous product name that was - Beau-line). Then the villain became his wife. A plot twist? I suppose so, but an entirely ridiculous one. Sharon Stone's character claimed that she had been using Beau-line for years. How is that possible? They're only just now getting ready to release the product. A product goes through years of research and testing, with trial and error, until the formula comes out right. So she's been using it during the research and testing period? Not likely. <br /> <br />The plot - who cared? Did anyone really care about Beau-line? Of course not! I *cared* about the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. I cared about the Joker in the first Batman movie, and definitely about Catwoman in the second (Michelle Pfeiffer, for what it matters, completely outperformed Berry in the role). There was some serious tension between these superheroes and their villains. But how could tension be created through the wiles of a corporation? <br /> <br />Also, how did the mild mannered little girl who was frightened of everything, it seems (but who walked out on a ledge to save a cat - um, duh?) manage to have that revolting leather costume in her closet? Seriously, that was deplorable. <br /> <br />What's very interesting about certain statistics regarding this film is that on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie DataBase), those who liked the movie most, in each age category, were women. I was surprised, as I thought adolescent boys would be much more interested. Perhaps not enough adolescent boys subscribe to pro.imdb.com. <br /> <br />Also, this movie won 4 Razzie awards: worst actress, worst director, worst picture, and worst screenplay. It was also nominated for three others. <br /> <br />The only reason I rented this was to see how truly bad it was. I think that it may have been worse than I expected it to be. <br />
0805047905|5.0|I was shopping for books for my new nephews, and ran across this one.  My children loved this book; even now at 18 and older, they can recall it!  The illustrations are beautiful, and a great book to learn to read along with (simple words in a rhythmmic presentation).
B00000AFGM|5.0|*Gasp*, you mean... Marilyn Manson... Changed? He sounds different? No! Stop the presses! That can't be good, can it? After the popularity he gained from Antichrist Superstar, he didn't make a carbon copy like everyone else? Wait, what are you talking about, he switched guitarists AGAIN? Dear non-existant Lord, what are we to do?    What are you to do? You're to go out and BUY the damn CD!    Yes, Mechanical Animals is vastly different from AC Star, but is that really so bad? How many bands do you know that have a great album and then follow it up with a horrible one that is almost exactly the same as the old one? Marilyn Manson knew that sticking with the same ol', same ol' wouldn't cut it, so he decided to shake things up.    The result is a remarkable masterpiece that is arguably his best CD to date (For me, it's a toss-up between this and AC Star. Sorry, Holy Wood fans...). there are so many different styles on this CD that it is completely unbelievable. He does have a little bit of the same ol', but he mixes industrial rock with 80s new wave seamlessly, with beautiful lyrics bursting with spite and truth.    And of course, you can't write a review about this album without noting Coma White, a truly beautiful song (And an amazing and controversial video that gave Conservatives a collective aneurism) that is by far his best. Not only are the lyrics perfectly worded and perfectly sung, but the music behind Manson is not unlike an orchestra born of hatred and animosity. When I heard this song, I heard peace poisoned by enmity's venom. I've always said that Marilyn Manson really knows how to finish an album.    So, to summarize what I've said, go buy this album. Thou shalt not regret it.
B00009V7T2|4.0|My Friend told me about these guys, so i checked em out. Interesting Guitar and drums. The vocals, well, Blew my Mind. Track 2 stands out as the greatest song with the greatest vocal range on this album. I may check out their new album.
068987474X|1.0|This book boggles my mind!  I am definitely NOT going to read it after reading the chapter titles!  Any book with chapter titles like that is obviously laying out some huge stereotypes that I am not interested in reading about, especially since this book is not supposed to be a comic book.   <br /> <br />But since I am a fan of Sex and the City and keep watching the DVDs long after Big swept Carrie in Paris, I want to say this! I can't believe that the reviewers here on amazon didn't pick up on the biggest contradiction of all regarding this book and it's author's affiliation with Sex and the City.  Carrie was absolutely blasted away by Big and his commitment issues throughout the whole show, the man obviously showed all the signs that he was not into her according to this book.  And then at the end Big comes running to her and tells her that she is the One and she happily bats her eyelashes and flies away with him?!? <br /> <br />Stop with this hypocrisy!  It is suffocating! <br /> <br />We present day women have our own set of issues, but I don't think that the solution to them is to revert back to some ridiculous rules!  It has nothing to do with the men, it has to do with what goes on in our own heads.  That is the \\"harsh\\" reality we have to face. <br />
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down has satisfied my \\"I hate America\\" Rock Genre for sometime, but this album takes the cake. Tracks like \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\" really get the blood flowing against your OWN COUNTRY. Others, such as \\"Bounce\\" and \\"Needles\\" need more intence listening to to fully get what these guys are saying (E.X \\"Bounce\\" is about Molestation).  <br /> <br />1. Prison Song - 5/5 - One of the most hilairous and strangly true songs on this CD. Great Lyrics and music.  <br /> <br />2. Needles - 4/5 - Weird, but in a good way. i have yet to find the meaning of this song however. a Tapeworm? huh? O.O <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance - 4/5 - Another Great song about how america is a corupted nation. *Sigh* I love Politics <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot - 3/5 - Uh. Sounded like Noise with a little bit of lyrics. They can do better, and they have done better.  <br /> <br />5. X - 4/5 - I Liked it. Short, But I Liked it. <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey! - 5/5 - One of their most reconizable songs. Very Popular. Great Lyrics and Memorable Music Video. <br /> <br />7. Bounce - 4/5 - a Weird Song about a girl getting molested? Hm... <br /> <br />8. Forest - 4.5/5 - Very Good song. Heavy guitar and drums. Lyrics are standard SOAD stuff. <br /> <br />9. ATWA - 3/5 - Do what?  <br /> <br />10. Science - 4/5 - Nice song. Cant say much about it though. Its a SOAD Song. Great Guitar and Lyrics, although i linger for more.. <br /> <br />11. Shimmy - 4/5 - Strangy, I liked this song, dispite its rapidness. Same format as ATWA and Jet Pilot. <br /> <br />12. Toxicity - 4.75/5 - You hear this on the radio even now. Awesome song about city life. I wish it were a bit fast, but other than that, it's Great! <br /> <br />13. Psycho - 4/5 - Kind of a Creepy Song. About Crack smoking groupies.  <br /> <br />14. Aerials - 5/5 - has \\"Symbolic song\\" written all over it. Great Lyrics and a great way to finish off a Great album.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|For all of you that find this cd to be a massive spacey head game, I have to ask the question. Have you heard any of their other stuff? Frances the Mute is probably The Mars Volta at their most.....well, normal if you can call it that. I'm not saying that this is an album built for pop radio, far from it. What I mean is that this is The Mars Volta minus the spacey drugged induced soundscapes that made De-loused in the Comatorium such an amazing album. This is more like The Mars Volta in 1976 trying to one-up Pink Floyd in the weird department and adding some serious speed to the mix. This cd is not for the light of heart though. By the 20th minute of Cassandra Geminni you maybe wanting a break. Over all though Frances the Mute is a good follow-up to probably my favorite cd from the past half-decade. Oh, and it is possible to play this album on repeat.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This movie is so awesome! The effects are great and the movie is so much fun. If you are a fan of old cerels from the 70s you will love this movie. If I was 10 years old and I saw this movie I would be in love with it and it would be my favorite movie! But instead I am 17 and I love this movie as much as if I was 9 0r 10 again! Great DVD, transfer, and features make this a must buy for fans of the films \\"The Incredibles\\", \\"Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope\\" or \\"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"!!!
B00006879E|4.0|I bought this album in the summer of 2002 when a record store was featuring it. It sounded funky and fun, so I thought I would take a chance and purchase it. It took listening to it a couple times to really love it, but I dont regret purchasing it.  But, by the time all the songs hit the radio I had already listed to the CD several hundred times. I was not as excited about them once the singles hit, but I still love listening to them. It is a great CD that is light, fun, dark and mysterious all at one time. I reccomend it.
158799190X|5.0|Everyone sees what he wants to see in a book. You want to learn something - you will find it in \\"Fooled by randomness\\". You want to concentrate on author's epistolaric manners - there will be plenty to talk about too. <br /> <br />Taleb is well educated and because of that interesting. Unlike  the corporate types that dominate modern finance. This book gives great insight on markets and mathematics of probability. It changes your thinking on luck and chance in life. It breaks down dogmas in finance and economics. Everyone interested in markets must read this book. <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|3.0|This album is not bad, but a bit rehashed. I really like Amy Lee's voice, its very captivating and downright beautiful. I think I bought this album because of \\"My Immortal\\" which is a great song. Most of the album is alright. It is really just mediocre for me, but I listen to it occasionally.
B0007N1AI6|3.0|Not bad overall.  Until you hear the track Lochness.  This could win the prize for the song with the most cheese.  The lyrics are regretful.
B000089RVR|4.0|After reading some of the reviews, I thought I would rate this album. I saw the negative reviews, although I can see why they may not like her CD, I truly enjoy it. This type of music is not for everyone. I have always enjoyed music by strong women artist who write their own music.  <br />     This album is just incredible. It is haunting, somber, beautful and enchanting all rolled into one. My husband bought this CD the second it dropped, and I have practically stolen it from him. I reccomend this album to anyone who wants to hear strong and moving lyrics rolled into simple style music. I give it four stars.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Being a pretty Simple Plan fan I own both albums that this band has released. After listening to \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls...\\" many times you can tell this truly was the bands first album. It has that sound and the lyrics were that of a young teenager even if the band members were in their 20's. However Simple Plan has released their second record titled \\"Still Not Getting Any\\", and you can tell the band has matured in many areas including their music, sound, and lyrics. Here's a rundown of all the songs: <br /> <br />1. Shut Up- The second single off the record. Extreamly catchy song. This is one song you can stuck in your head. The video is good as well. <br />2. Welcome to my Life- The first single. It little overplayed. One of the first slower songs on the album. The lyrics might be that would come out of a teenagers diary. This song is also very catchy. <br />3. Perfect World- Okay song. I'm still getting used to it. I don't like the intro to the song. The band could of done better when writing the intro. <br />4.Thank You- Once again, we have another vry catchy song from Simple Plan. Very fast. Reminds of Pierre's old band Reset. <br />5.Me Against The World- Another catchy song. Another song about what a teenager thinks. Simple lyrics. <br />6.Crazy- Good lyrics. Pretty much sums up what the band thinks about society. <br />7.Jump- Just a catchy song. Another song with simple lyrics. <br />8.Everytime- Possibly my favorite song on the record. About driving until the sun comes up. Being woken up at 3 am by your boyfriend or girlfriend. Driving until the sun comes up is not likely to happen if your 15. One of the songs that shows Simple Plan's maturity through their lyrics. <br />9. Promise- Another one of my favorites. <br />10.One- Another slow song. Good lyrics. <br />11. Untitled- The song I love. Chuck doesn't play on this song. Just Pierre, some strings and piano. Could possibly be the next single. <br /> <br />Other side of album: Shows a movie for about 20 minuets about the recording of \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\". It also shows some pictures, lyrics, discoography, web links, and credits. This new album is a new concept called a DualDisc.
B00005KFUN|5.0|While British rock band Muse are big in the UK, the US is only just starting to get acquainted with these original, entrancing musicians. And their second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" they accomplish the almost impossible -- every song is epic and thrilling.<br /><br />The first two songs open with delicate rippling piano intros that suddenly blossom into rock riffs. Feedback kicks off into sizzling basslines and riffs in \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased,\\" while wind chimes and an acoustic melody are at the heart of \\"Screenager.\\" \\"Hyper Music\\" is the only dud. It's a discordant clatter that becomes a discordant rock song -- nuff zed.<br /><br />But as good as most of the album is, Muse save the best for absolute last. The penultimate song \\"Feeling Good\\" is perhaps the best -- fuzzy chopsticks start the song, followed by a stretch of epic rock and soaring vocals. The finale is no less entrancing, a slowly stately wave of sound that slowly transitions into an equally rich rock song.<br /><br />Americans really got to know Muse through their latest album, \\"Absolution.\\" But it's not the only album they have done, nor is it the best. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" may well take that honor, or at least tie with their debut \\"Showbiz.\\" Relatively few people know about these earlier albums, or about the rich apocalyptic quality of Muse at their best.<br /><br />Muse is definitely a band for Radiohead fans -- it has the same rich spaciness and art-rock quality, but it's more grounded and gritty. The most entrancing instrumentation is done on piano -- it can be delicate, dark, fuzzy, or outright epic. The piano is accompanied by smashing percussion, sinuous riffs and basslines, and sweeps of spellbinding electronics.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy puts his good vocals to use in every song, and he's as versatile as his piano. Much of the time he opts for the smooth, low sound. But he also gets to howl, and occasionally sounds like he's been huffing helium. And the songwriting is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.ing is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"  <br />  <br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.
B00000099Y|5.0|Ok, to say their music sounds like a whole bunch of monkeys palying is just BS.  There guitare work, drum playing, bass playing, and singing is just amazing.  Yeah, I do understand that not everyone is going to like TOOL, but you have to respect them in my opinion.  When you hear Maynerd sing you can tell he is singing with passion and he loves what he does and the same goes for all the members.  To say that amazing guitare work, drums, bass guitare, vocals sounds like a whole bunch of monkeys, you are obviously NOT LISTENING to the music, but HEARING it.  There is tune in the music, there is a steady beat in the music.  If it actually sounds like a whole bunch of monkeys going crazy then there would not be a steady beat and there would not be a tune. One thing is for sure TOOL IS NOT NU - METAL.  YOu can't compare Tool to Nine Inch Nails anyway because they are completely two different genres of music.  One Nine Inch Nails is INDUSTRIAL and  two Tool is Heavy Metal.  To say Tool is Nu - Metal and sounds like Deftones, I can see what you mean in terms of lyrics, in terms of written music, but not sound.  Tool's sound is completely different then that of the Detones, or any Nu - Metal group, so to classify them as Nu - Meatl is rediculous.  Tool has a different sound then any other Atrist i know of.   <br /> <br />If you don't like them thats fine, but at leat classify them in the correct GENRE of MUSIC.  Also, you need to at least respect this group because they are a big influence on many groups of music now a days.  Like, how metal from the 90's and into the Mellenium were influened by Black Sabbath, you will see that in a couple of years the influence is going to be that of TOOL.   <br /> <br />Just wait and see.  Tool has done so much for music and so many people don't realize it yet, but soon you will.
B0000630BT|5.0|A friend of mine unwittingly introduced me to Judas Priest, and he didn't even know it.  We began a road trip to Nebraska's Cabellas, and he threw on Breaking the Law, telling me it was Twisted Sister.<br /><br /><br /><br />A few years later, I became one of the newest Priest fans (before Angel of Retribution's release) when a more knowledgeable friend let me borrow Painkiller.  I haven't looked back since.<br /><br /><br /><br />This album blows much of my own metal collection out of the water.  The sound is heavy, but melodic.  The songs here are borne of JP's genius combination of speed, fancy and melodic vocals, solos that are actually interesting to listen to, and Halford's awesome banshee cries.  I was afraid it'd annoy me, but it's one of the few voices that actually makes my skin crawl!  I get goosebumps during Nightcrawler's superb counterpoint solos, which collide into a deep, crushing thrust of a sustained, low chord, and Halford cries out, \\"As night is falling, the end is drawing neeaarrr-ah!\\"<br /><br /><br /><br />Yeah.  You'd think that song would throw in a chorus or two and then finish, right?  JP takes it a step further and throws in an eerie, baritone-voiced third-person omniscient stanza describing victims' last agonizing moments before death.<br /><br /><br /><br />Each song is like this.  \\"Brilliantly conceived.  Brilliantly executed.\\"  Each is massive in its own right.  The title track is the second longest track, but enthralling throughout.  Between the Hammer & the Anvil will have you headbanging and throwing hand signs, even if you're a shy woman in the middle of a job interview who happens to overhear this song from someone's cubicle stereo.  Touch of Evil is perhaps the most mature song, beginning with a strange wind, growing into a whirlwind of synth-strings and drums and guitars...it just grows from there, culminating into Halford's shrieking \\"You're possessing me!\\"<br /><br /><br /><br />Black was never this cool.  Chrome was never this cool.  And when I found out it was JP who sang Breaking the Law...well, my rank as fan-for-life was etched in stone.sang Breaking the Law...well, my rank as fan-for-life was etched in stone.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I went and saw this movie late at night. I didn't want to go really because I was tired and I had to work the next morning at 5am....boy am I glad I went and saw this movie. from beginning to end, this movie had me laughing as hard as the first time I saw dumb and dumber (in theatres as well). when my laugh is just about to die down from a scene that happened 5 minutes ago, another scene comes along and overtakes that and it leaves me with eyes full of tears throughout. there was a couple sitting behind my gf and I and the girlfriend was snorting uncontrollably....that's just how funny this movie was/is. <br /> <br />from the surgery scene, to puppets fighting hand to hand combat, to MATT DAMON!! this movie is loaded with raunchy jokes that you just can't help but laugh to. the title song of this movie, which plays alot through the movie, is hysterical as well. <br /> <br />I can't wait for May 17th....I can't wait to laugh as hard as I did the night this movie came out
B00006AUIG|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this movie over and over. I first saw it at BlockBuster when they only had one VHS copy (At which time I didn't have a VHS player) so I had to wait until they got it on DVD. After two months, they finally did. I snatched it right up. This movie freaked the hell out of me. The problem with this movie unlike most horror flicks, is that it seems to be something that could happen the exact same way in real life. Now, I say problem in a good way. This movie has captivated me in many different ways. There is a personal story behind this film that most readers probably do not want to hear about. BUT, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys cult flicks and that is willing to watch the movie multiple times to \\"get it.\\" It takes about two to three times of watching this flick to completely understand it. Either that, or someone who pays a LOT of attention.  <br /> <br />Excellent buy! A+++
B00007AJF9|5.0|\\"Elizabeth\\" is a visually stunning and powerfully written film based on one of the great monarchs in history. Some reviewers here shamelessly slam the movie based on \\"historical inaccuracies.\\" They forget drama is not meant to be seen for research for tomorrow's homework assignment, the great dramatists like Shakespeare regularly re-wrote history when doing a drama. And even then, the script makes valid attempts to look behind the icon of Elizabeth (there is very substantial evidence that she was not really a virgin in the sexual sense and that Robert Dudely was a lover). Director Shekhar Kapur gives us a rich tapestry of characters and locations, feelings and history. An Indian, Kapur paints his movie with the lush textures of India, but he keeps a wonderful English feel to it all and Cate Blanchett is magnificent as Elizabeth, conveying strength, fear and compassion. Richard Attenborough, Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes all deliver noteworthy performances as well. The screenplay by Michael Hirst is smart, poetic and full of political intrigue. The music by David Hirschfelder is marvelous, it creates mood and provides some rich melodies like the love theme. What Kapur does with great success here is transport us to another world and time, we feel like onlookers viewing a great drama unfolding. There is pure suspense in how Elizabeth must find a way to survive and overcome her enemies. Someone complained here about the violence, obviously this person has not read that much history and well babe, history is pretty bloody. \\"Elizabeth\\" is a powerful experience, you can view it for the characters and drama and simply enjoy the cinematography, which is done with the eye of a painter. The costumes and light are all used to create an almost dreamy effect. And of course there is the human side of the film. It's a story about the courage to advance when thrust into a position of authority and if needing to be alert and intelligent when navigating the turbulent waters of power. \\"Elizabeth\\" is a wonderful tapestry of a movie, not to be missed by admirers of focused, intelligent and visually rich filmmaking.
B00006LLNU|5.0|If I may, I should like to make a few brief points concerning this beautiful chef d'oeuvre.    For those who have written that each of the pieces on this album sound similar, I suggest a closer listen should be made a priority. It is like an inexperienced teenager listening to a brilliant adagio by Bach, then one by Albinoni, and one of Chopin's nocturnes being played pianissimo late on a calm, warm night, and throwing up his hands impatiently and in despaire, proclaiming that each is boring and repetitive, and that nothing can distinguish them. () is not a dance album, I'll be the first to admit; nor should it be treated that way. In fact, referring to the seperate pieces on () as songs do them a great disservice! Imagine them, instead, as being the elegiac strains of a beautifully melancholic sylph dancing lithely in the breeze on a winter night. () is an album of enchantment and magic. One reviewer commented that \\"if Heaven has a soundtrack, this is it!\\" That is very true!      Do not rush to judgement simply because you do not understand its purpose, meaning, or movement.
B00067TVHU|2.0|I love zombie movies.  I don't know what it is about the living dead that is so appealing.  I was definitely looking forward to a film satirizing the zombie flick, namely Shaun of The Dead.  First of all, I'm not a big fan of satire films that use puns of the films they're poking fun at as their titles.  Whether it be Shaun of the Dead or Night of The Living Bread, it just comes across to in-your-face &quot;this is supposed to be funny&quot;.<BR>I enjoyed the first half or so of the Shaun of The Dead.  I thought the gags were funny, like the false alarms when you're thinking 'okay, this is when the dead start to walk' and it doesn't happen.  Then when it does start to happen, it's played off as something normal happening, until the very end of the scene.  The humour in the film was funny.  I didn't laugh out loud, but I enjoyed it.  <BR>It wasn't until the survivors make their way to their fortress/sanctuary, Shaun's favorite pub, that the film goes downhill for me.  It just gets too dark and depressing and very sad.  I just don't see the humor in killing someone you love or care about.  I know that part wasn't supposed to be humorous, but because its such a huge downer, the film doesn't recover.<BR>I'd recommend renting this film first just to see if you like it.  But if you're expecting a hilarious, gut busting film from beginning to end, you might be disappointed.
B00006RINF|1.0|Hmm...How boring does it get. Well if you put a track on repeat you probably wont notice when it starts or finishes as there are no defining moments on this entire cd. Cristina is slighlty flat but brilliant compared to the male singer. Listen guys, sing in your own language! When rammstein sing in german they sound great, in english? Well try not to laugh. Itallian is such a sexy language, it would be 10 times better in Italian. I speak from experiance. I live in spain and  when my freinds sing in english, no matter how good they are in spanish, it sounds bad, if the pronounciation is slightly off or if they are struggeling and concentrating too much, which leads to sounding robotic. This is the problem here. Chow!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This CD is wonderful to have as a background.  We all know the songs and the guest singers and Ray's voice blends wonderfully with them all.  It is mellow but not meloncholy
B00005JLTR|5.0|BAD NEWS ! As i have said before A Star Is Born was Going to be released on September 20th 2005 but sadly it has been DELAYED and wont be out till December 6th 2005. But Thats still Good News ! The DVD will not be Two Dvds and will have deleted scenes, wardrobe takes , and other things. The Movie is great and is Barbra at her best but isnt she always great
0446608955|1.0|I picked up the book hoping it would be yet another breathtaking novel from Nicholas Sparks-it was not...I dragged myself through this seemingly endless novel about young love interrupted by life...The plot itself is good (the preacher's daughter has cancer and is in love) but the delivery is completely wrong...There were so many cliches and boring metaphorical virtues in it that it was like going to church, and for once, I wished I was the one who had cancer.
B000002UAU|1.0|Maybe i'm just too old but I bought this album due to all the praises it has received expecting to hear classic Beatles. I was very disappointed with it and gave it to my daughter for my grandkids. They didn't like it either & it now sits on a shelf. I really like the \\"old\\" Beatles & also have their # 1 Album which is OK. As I said, maybe i'm just too old and the fact that my favorite music is Chicago type blues by Muddy Waters. John Lee Hooker, etc. might color my music enjoyment.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|To me that is the criteria of a good movie. <br />The other countries bonuses for background got lost to me as the action held center stage.  But still beautiful. <br /> <br />Matt Damon has finally started to reach his potential in the action genre - with plenty of it in this movie. <br /> <br />The death of Marie led to a cold, calculated trail of revenge. <br />With Kirill trying to kill Bourne [and not succeeding] and nailing Marie instead was a big mistake on his part. <br /> <br />With Bourne being chased not only by Kirill but also by his own treacherous people the action just kept esculating to a violent show-down. <br /> <br />The conflict within Bourne helped to humanize him and led to the great scene where he approaches the daughter of the pair he had assassinated to explain that her mother did not kill her father as supposed. <br /> <br />Definitely Recommended -- a great set. <br /> <br />
B000002AH1|4.0|When Miles and Co. cook on this one, they burn the house down. I remember driving home and popping this in when I got it and almost running the car off the road. The first track pounds you to death then slows down, never losing its heavy deep funk groove. Listening to it I always thought Miles' playing on this was in particular very badass. Just hearing him come in and making these weird noises with the wah pedal, then pausing and coming back in screeching and playing a ripping clean solo gives me chills. The way he paused when he played was genius; it was like he was giving you time to recover, and his solos never seemed too long because of the pauses he put in there. The studio tracks are pretty much hit or miss as reviewers have said; they're moody but for the most part very pretty in a weird loud way. The live tracks are really where the action is. Everyone really gets their chance in the spotlight on \\"What I Say\\", an incredibly funky and hot jam. Not one solo outshines another on this one; everyone is pretty much mind-blowing (although I thought the drum solo was pretty wild....maybe since it was towards the end and that's the last thing you hear on the song). \\"Funky Tonk\\" is right up there with the previous track and \\"Inamorata....\\" kicks for the most part and ends the album on a weird note. All and all this album will totally blow you away, specifically the live tracks. Weird cosmic funk that turns everything else into roadkill....probably the best description.
B000002I6T|5.0|I had three albums in school in 1971: &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; by David Crosby, &quot;Madman across the Water&quot; by Elton John, and &quot;Blue&quot; by Joni Mitchell. They each capture the creative and socially analytical spirit of those times and are timeless musical masterpieces. True &quot;Desert Island Discs!&quot; I keep watching for a remastered version, but the original is as fresh and youthful and intelligent as ever. Get it now, get all three!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Wow...  so many people are reviewing 'Funeral', mine will get eaten up quickly.  But it says something for this album I think.    You know of music that hooks you on 1st listen, and gradually addicts you during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, until you gladly anticipate every beat, chord, and inflection in your head as it is played?  Music that leaves you wanting to tell all of your friends and looking to see if the band might be playing soon in a town near you?  Music that makes you happier just because it exists....  This is that kind of music.    Every song is an anthem in its own right.  The only good reason not to try 'Funeral' is if you simply do not have time to join another fan club.
B000058983|5.0|I first became a LOVE fan after hearing their 2nd LP; Da Capo.  Loving 'Forever Changes' is very easy to do.  Among my favorite LP's of ALL TIME!<br /><br />I own every LOVE lp and cd available to the masses.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, I grew up in the East Coast and never saw LOVE perform LIVE until Arthur Lee re-grouped, and I moved West and flew to Portand, OR to experience his live show in 2003.<br /><br />It's unfortunate Bryan is gone, but that show gave me goosebumps!  How Arthur was able to duplicate that 60's LOVE sound was unreal!<br /><br />Forever Changes, in any form, is a MUST for anyone into Serious GOOD Music!
B0007NFL1S|3.0|hey yo 50 cent couldn't live up to the hype the only reason this album is selling is cause it was so anticpated and they wanted to see if 50 could killem like he did in get rich or die trying the only good part about the cd is the beats cause the lyrics are soo weak and 50 better watch what he says about kiss cause kiss will lyriclly destroy him and he already shot down the piggy bank song with a track called checkmate if you haven't heard it listen to it cause it totally destroys 50
B000007638|4.0|I agree with most other reviewers who have correctly pointed out that \\"Wings Over America\\" is McCartney's best live album. I owned this as an LP many years ago, and finally broke down and paid the almost $42 price tag for a copy on CD, which as good as the set is, is still a steep price for it (hence the four star rating for value). The concert itself is very energetic and cleanly recorded, and blows away all subsequent McCartney live albums in terms of energy, musicianship, and song selection.<br /><br />For me the unquestioned high point on the CD is \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", a song that became a huge hit after this album was released, and deservedly so. This is one case where the live version stands head and shoulders above the earlier studio version. Other standouts are \\"Live and Let Die\\", and the opening medley of \\"Venus and Mars\\" and \\"Rock Show\\". There are, however, some losers on the album, notably the ultra-schlocky early McCartney solo hits \\"Let 'Em In\\", \\"My Love\\", and \\"Listen to What the Man Said\\", which as much as I like Paul, are just never good in any setting. The overall song selections are an eclectic mix, and are generally enjoyable to listen to as a set.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this as the best of all the McCartney live albums, I just question the value of the two CD set at $41.49, but if you have the money to spare and you like McCartney you can't really go wrong with this one.
0064407667|5.0|There are very few people who have the gift of writing that Lemony Snicket has. He is the only writer I have ever read with his strange humor and ability to incorperate vocabulary lessons into a story that fit perfectly; he uses the now famous \\"which here means...\\" technique. This is his first book in the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" series, and it may be one of his finest. It tells the misadventures of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire, who become orphans within the first few pages of the books (and whose names are not without a purpose; one who enjoys a little political humor may want to look into them). The story is ridden with carefully represented woe that saves the reader from pitying the orphans and instead has him or her cheering alongside them, which can prove embarassing if the book is being read in a public setting. The adventures are not too outrageous, indeed, the solutions to the problems prove Mr. Snicket to be a clever chap, but if you read book one, you will certainly continue on to book two.  <br />So be forewarned: He has the knack of continuing a story without making it seem cumbersome, but as the books add up, so does the stress and unyeilding desire to buy the next book. If one cannot handle this book, DO NOT continue the series; the trouble gets much, much worse, to say the least. Even I am getting a queasy feeling inside me as I search for an available copy of the Slippery Slope.
1881273156|5.0|Everyone who has had a significant relationship understands the fundamental reality that relationships are hard and require lots of work to be successful. Of all the books I have read on relationships, this one has the best, most applicable, most practical, and most comprehensible advice for couples (targeted particularly to married couples). In this book Gary Chapman explains his concept of the \\"five love languages\\" which are in a sense just the ways that different people give and receive love (and desire love to be demonstrated to them). He explains different viewpoints about love in relationships in a reasonable and graspable manner that anyone can understand, and of key import, he helps you determine your primary love language or love languages (some people like me have two). When combined with the love language of your partner, you can quickly see where things can potentially go asunder.<br /><br />Although he doesn't specifically recommend it as a premarital compatibility tool, I think that is perhaps one of the best uses you could make of this book. Hopefully you can find someone with the same languages you share, but if you can't you can at least know what to expect in future interactions with your intended spouse.<br /><br />This book is very simple and very easy to read (I read it easily in an afternoon), but it is also very powerful and helpful. Like most books of this sort, this is normally read by people in a struggling relationship, but I also recommend it for people in a healthy relationship (though perhaps less urgently) to try to improve what already seems great.<br /><br />This book was recommended by a trusted friend of mine; it sounded so useful that I ordered it the same night she told me about it, and read it the day after it arrived. I am so grateful that she recommended it to me: this book really opened my eyes on relationships in general and was right on target in my own personal experience. I am a skeptic by nature, but I recommend this book highly and without reservation to anyone in any kind of a relationship.his book highly and without reservation to anyone in any kind of a relationship. <br />
6305622914|5.0|Comedy is so hard to do well, but this movie is nearly flawless in striking the right balance between humorous and touching scenes.<br /><br />The performances are great and so genuine that you almost feel like you're watching real people trying to get through their day.  There are only a couple scenes that don't seem true to the spirit of the story, but they don't detract from the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I'll admit to struggling a bit with the accents the first time I watched it, but repeated viewings have revealed all.  It also helps to have an English brother-in-law...<br /><br />The soundtrack is great and is used to great effect during the scene in the unemployment line.<br /><br />This is a very funny movie.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I really have to say that I think this movie is amazing.  While I think the story is painfully dumb (as in the way nobody ever tries to do anything to stop the phantom), the music is spectacular.  I'd choose the movie soundtrack over the original Broadway recording in a second.  Though Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are technically better singers, I don't think Crawford sounds like a phantom in misery and Emmy Rossum is just so much more pleasant to listen to than Brightman.  So don't trust the pretentious individuals who gave this movie a negative review.  After all, they know so much more about music than you do  ::rolls eyes::.  I could understand how people could be disappointed because they have this preconceived vision of how the phantom should be, but I must say, this production is amazing.
B00003CXE7|5.0|`Gladiator', directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe succeeds, like `Spartacus' and unlike `Troy' because it is less about action and violence than it is about politics and righting a wrong. In fact, except for the opening battle scene with the Russell Crowe improvised line, `On my signal, unleash Hell', the combat direction and filming is not as well done as Brad Pitt's battle scenes in Troy. This is not to say `Gladiator' did these poorly. It's just that the real interest is in the political conflict between Commodus, Marcus Aurelius' son, played to the hilt by Jaoquin Phoenix and Crowe's character, the Roman general Maximus.<br /><br />Regarding the historical action and scenes, I think the film's set designers, costumers, set decorators, and special effects artists got almost everything almost exactly right. In fact, it is a great treat to see talented special effects put to good use on something other than star destroyers, Nazgul, and vampires. The effects lavished on the Coliseum were not just for the sake of impressive size. They added lots of very effective touches such as the relatively recently discovered awnings used to shade the fans in the upper bleachers. Combat, both in pitched battle in Germania and in the arena is very well researched. It was an excellent little touch to see Maximus loose a sword, only to instantly draw a backup sword from his saddle and continue reigning death and distruction on the barbarians. It's amazing how a minor inaccuracy can ruin the effect of some of the very best movies, such as when modern tanks were used in battles between Americans and Germans in North Africa in `Patton'. You would think they could scare up at least a dozen American Sherman tanks and a half dozen German Mk IV's. Similarly, I really began to wonder why Aurilius' daughter seems to be wearing but a single style of earring throughout the whole movie, which covers at least a year of real time.<br /><br />Note that most of the special effects really succeed better on the small screen than they do on a big theatrical screen. The seams between live action and the effects seem to be a bit less noticeable.<br /><br />I have been a Russell Crowe fan since I saw him in `LA Confidential' and I doubled my respect for his abilities when I saw his appearance on the Bravo interview show, `Inside the Actor's Studio'. In that one-hour interview, he revealed a greater insight into the craft of acting than the interviews of William H. Macy, Robert Redford, and Robin Williams all rolled into one. If any actor can be said to have inherited the mantle of Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Montgomery Cliff, it must be Crowe. In this interview, he said that the cast and crew began shooting the film with not much more than an outline. This may seem typical on a Jim Carrey or Robin Williams comedy where the producers are reasonable in expecting the great improvisational talents of these actors to carry them over the rough spots, but this seems inconceivable when you are shooting a historical costume drama with a budget of over 100 million dollars. It turns out that some of the most effective lines in the movie were Crowe inventions on the spot. The importance of Crowe to the movie cannot be underestimated, as the intensity drops by several notches when Crowe is not on the screen, and by several more when neither Crowe nor Phoenix are on the screen.<br /><br />The three veteran character actors, Oliver Reed as the gladiator master, Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and Derek Jacobi as the Roman senator, Graccus, competently carry out their roles, but none are quite as convincing as the second string actors in the great Masterpiece Theatre series `I, Claudius'. Their performances also cannot hold a candle to the similar roles in `Spartacus' played by Peter Ustinov, Laurence Olivier, and Charles Laughton. I think this is not from lack of talent, I think it is from poor writing. The only other important role, Marcus Aurelius'daughter, is very weakly played and written. Against Crowe and Phoenix, the part really needed a much stronger presence such as Angelina Jolie, Hillary Swank, or Charlize Theron. These quasi-historical characters need both powerful performances and recognizable faces so you instantly know this is an important character, since they will probably be on the screen for less than a quarter of the movie.<br /><br />All of this is interesting to gab about, but the real meat of the movie, again, is politics. This shows that even in dictatorships, even those backed up by hereditary legitimacy, having the backing of the nobility and the army was required to carry out your agenda. As far as I have been able to determine from my reading of history, much of this story is fictional, based on the real Emperor Marcus Aurelius, his campaign against the Teutons, his death, and the succession of his son, Comedus. I can find no trace of the character Maximus. Crowe's description of the genesis of the character in his interview convinces me that he is pure invention, which the writers were to name `Narcissus'. Crowe talked them out of that one. But that is neither here nor there. The drama is based on the fact that as a gladiator, Maximus gains the favor of the crowd by his victories in the arena, and Comedus cannot dispatch him except in a public venue.<br /><br />I must say that the music written for the movie, especially for the dream sequences when Maximus anticipates returning to his family in Elysium (heaven of Roman religion), is especially effective, even if the tunes and the vocals have a very strong Gaelic sound to them. The dream melodies would fit quite nicely into the elven scenes of `Lord of the Rings' as they do in ancient Rome.<br /><br />`Gladiator' may not endure as a classic like `Spartacus', but Crowe's performance alone is worth the price of admission.relius' daughter, is very weakly played and written.

B0002OERI0|5.0|oh, green day. <br /> <br />they're like my babies, you know. <br /> <br />but i've had this cd for a few months now, and i reckon i can finally be a little objective about it (instead of hyperventilating and having metaphorical exclamation marks around me whenever i talk of it). <br /> <br />so. i want to direly skip over the \\"green day=sellouts and i feel really hardxcore saying that\\" bit that everyone hates, but erk, i've got things to say and i'm going to say them, yeah? <br /> <br />green day's sound has changed. and i say, thank god for that. i pose a question to all you \\"old-school\\" fans: would you rather they had produced four dookie's in a decade, or that we're left with a brilliant path of progression in the form of insomniac, nimrod, warning and now american idiot? <br /> <br />i don't understand you people, sometimes. apparently, green day is screwed regardless what they do: if they made dookie over and over, they'd be flamed for sounding the same. when they try to do something different, they're accused of selling to the masses. but let's be realistic: what business would green day, being multi-millionaires and all, have to spend four years painstakingly producing an album just for the ears of mtv douches? i think they'd do something more constructive with their time, yeah? <br /> <br />american idiot defies words adequate to describe it. yes, i've been a fan of green day for 6+ years (for some reason, that seems to be a pre-requisite to have any sort of valid opinion about them). and sure, dookie was brilliant and groundbreaking at it's time of release. but that was a decade ago. think back to ten years ago; how much have you changed? green day aren't twenty year olds getting stoned every day of the week (.. generally. i think they still have their moments). they've looked around and thought, \\"hey, we don't like what we see.\\" and OI! a lot of other people don't, either. <br /> <br />they're not calling americans idiots. they're calling the sector of people who accept the spoon-fed information as fact and goes with whatever is convenient instead of getting their hands dirty, as \\"american idiots\\". we should all condemn those people; they're the ones who are going to ruin any semblence of justice in the world. if you're not one of them, what on EARTH are you getting offended about? the reason i'm not bashing green day's opinion on bush expressed in the album is because i've done my research, and i can tell that they've done THEIRS. contrary to hardxcore belief, they know what they're talking about and i can't find a better representation of the disenfranchised youth of the 2000's. <br /> <br />highlights of the record are difficult to find. the whole thing is f*cking blinding. \\"jesus of suburbia\\", \\"holiday\\" and \\"letterbomb\\" i probably dig the most, though. they get into your brain and don't let go of you until long after the song is finished. \\"boulevard of broken dreams\\" IS a good song (people seem to enjoy bashing the hell out of it because, shock!, it's popular in the charts). the weakest link could possibly be \\"extraordinary girl\\", and i feel blasphemous putting a bad word to this disc. <br /> <br />there's a story here that every girl and boy can find meaning to; there are hundreds of interpretations and to this day, i'm still tossing up with what i believe to be \\"correct\\". i've owned american idiot for six or so months now, and it has only left my discman for other green day albums (and some smashing pumpkins here and there).  <br /> <br />i saw them in concert in sydney just four days ago. for a sixteen year old, i reckon i've got a fair bit of experience under my belt, as far as concerts go. i've got a lot of bands to compare them with. and with a line-up of bands i've seen, including goldfinger, a perfect circle, lagwagon, less than jake, seether, system of a down, metallica, BOWIE!, ani difranco, elvis costello (etc etc etc) i can tell you that green day tops that list, hands down (the closest is probably bowie, and that's expected). they were out of this world. their command and presence .. rawr. you had to be there. i didn't think it was possible, but all of their albums, from 1039/smooth, have triple the sentimental value to me now. and i adore the way green day make me feel. <br /> <br />thanks green day, hey. i reckon your fifteen year career has been bloody ace.
068987474X|4.0|The only people who don't \\"buy\\" the concept of this perceptive, funny, smart and realistic book, are those who wish to live in a fantasy. I found this book to be extremely uplifting and liberating, mostly because it articulated all the things I already knew but never wanted to believe.  Maybe the basic idea of the book could have been summed up in fewer pages, but the specific scenarios the author addresses are what makes this book so applicable to so many women.  Maybe life isn't as simplistic and black-and-white as the title concept would have one think, but the fact is, men ARE black and white.  They are simple creatures when it comes to love, women, and sex, and we can't deny the biological facts that this books bases itself on.  Maybe it shouldn't be that way, but it is---men are the chasers, it's what they have always done, and what they will continue to do if they really like a woman.  And a note to all those who say that we women should be able to \\"go after\\" men and be \\"active and not passive\\" just like in our careers---I have a news flash for you:  Relationships and Careers are NOT THE SAME THING.  Having a successful relationship is not the same thing as getting a promotion or landing a new job.  This book acknowledges that maybe its advice sounds antiquated or unfair, but it's also reality.  I highly recommend this book to any woman, whether she's single, dating, married or divorced--it will definitely help you if you let it!

I can't believe this trash got this much exposure. I didn't hear one song off this album that made me believe the hype. Which is all this camp has to offer. Nothing more....Kid, please take time to write your own thoughts down vs. jumping on the band wagon like 90% of the laker fans in the late 90s-00s. Because clearly you didn't listen to the same CD I heard. And I heard both the bootleg and the retail Massacre cd. It was a Massacre for my brain to take in this trash. And like Jadakiss said in the \\"I'm an Animal\\" 50 cent diss song (which should be linked on this site right under the price) this CD will only be used by all those folks that bought it as something to chop weed on or as a drink coaster because its that bad. All you folks enjoying this garbage posed as hip hop (which is nothing but hip pop) I'll pray for you. Go get some Deltron 3030, Jedi Mind Tricks, Immortal Technique and or Souls of Mischeif to learn what real hip hop is then we'll have a converation
B000001GGV|5.0|Pogorelich really exploits the loud-soft and gradations between them in this very idiomatic piano recording. The selection is a little limited--maybe too many from the Essercizi?  But he plays them so well!  Everyone does K 1, but Pogorelich makes it sound like music (unlike Tomsic or Pletnev).  K 8 sounds like a tragic funeral march for 3-legged mortally wounded--not a very attractive description, but I mean he gets that gothic horror. And K 450 is perfect--no labor at all to the difficult trills.<br /><br />I do complain a little of the repetitions that are mostly exact.<br /><br />A little variation would be nice.  Still, this is the album I'd be most likely to play for a Scarlatti virgin in hopes of seduction!
B00023B1LC|4.0|The first time around I missed the thrust of this film. Maybe it was the quick tempo or the technical spy jargon that is thrown pell-mell at the viewer in the first few scenes, but in any case I was quickly confused. By the time I caught up with what Jason Bourne might have been and who he was trying to be, I had lost my desire to care.  When the film appeared again a few months later on Cable TV, however, I  forced myself to watch it more intensely. Whether it was the manner I employed or merely because I had been previously exposed, the second impression became a more rewarding experience: I was able to follow an intriguing, rather than distorted, plot; the European locations took on more relevance as they richly enhanced the authenticity of the story; and the action served as a prism through which I could better understand the character of Jason Bourne.  Eventually I realized that this is not, as I had initially believed, merely a movie peppered with special effects and computerized production to provide immediate visual stimulation.  It is all that, but it is also a film of multi-layered substance, not least of which is its complex, sympathetic main character, who, gifted in intelligence and expertly trained, must overcome all odds. Opposed alike by those he was sent to destroy as well as by his own leaders, he must survive by battling, not with special James Bond-like gadgets from another world, but, more believably, with his wits and guile. His amnesia prompts him to search for his identity, but that quest also forces him to question his very role as a hired assassin, perhaps, with the support of a woman he has serendipitously met, regaining his sense of humanity along the way.  We are ultimately, therefore, treated to a riveting, fast-paced, yet thought-provoking, odyssey.  Matt Damon, appearing more comfortable and confident than usual, ably plays the part of Bourne, complemented by brilliant supporting performances from Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brain Cox, and  Clive Owen, who, with only a few lines, brings a ton of presence to the \\"Professor\\" character.    In the end, I was fortunate that I gave this movie a second chance. It's now one of my favorites.
0451207521|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book.  It may have been a little overly graphic in its details to violence and a little predictable but it made for a great read.  It was easy to get hooked on it and you felt as if you were right there cheering the heros on while deprising the evil doers.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I saw this movie with my family, and I can't really understand the reviews of people who thought the movie was slow-miving, had no plot, et cetera. The point of the movie was that it had no plot. What possible plot can the school- and home- life of the nerdiest nerd ever devised have? Any palpable plot that pervaded the entirety of the movie would have been against the point of the film. Napoleon Dynamite is a guy who stumbles through life trying to do what he can with what he has. The problem is, though, that his life is extremely dull and boring, so he does things that are hilarious and endearing. For instance, he plays tetherball with his feet, with devastating results, plus the ball gets wrapped around the pole. All of us who were geeks in high school can relate to that. And he has the funniest voice in the world. The things he does in the movie... I watched and every five seconds shouted, \\"That's what I would have done!\\" For instance, he attempts to vault a fence and ends up falling on his back. Napoleon has none of the coolness extant in all other movies these days. And this has no alcohol, drugs, or whatever, which makes for a refreshing change. Those who don't like this movie don't understand high-school life for those not in the 'in' crowd, and the utter hellish boredom of life in general. That's what this movie is about.
B00005NVDF|4.0|I'll admit that I'm a fan of Woody Allen's work, but I still think the scene in his apartment in which his friends introduce him to the blind date with whom they've fixed him up is the funniest movie scene ever!  Woody tries desperately to appear cool, suave, and sophisticated...and of course fails as only he can. A must-see cinema moment.
6300267997|5.0|Each version of A Star is Born reflects its decade of production, and nowhere is that more evident than in this 1976 Streisand-Kristofferson spectacular. Here's the 1970s in all their embarrasing glory, from the decor of Streisand's apartment to her to-die-for clothes. Probably not the best version of the story, but a terrific guitly pleasure.
6304493738|5.0|The Usual Suspects is one of those movies I've heard legendary tales of for years but that I never got around to watching. The DVD I watched was the original disc (not the fancy new one), and since this movie came out ten years ago the audio and visual quality were pretty bad. But since this is an old-fashioned movie in the sense that it wants to entertain by telling a real story with interesting characters instead of putting all its hopes in flashy special effects, the bad quality of the technology didn't actually matter. The plot is rather confusing, involving the complex lives of five career criminals, strange underground crime deals, and an unseen, mysterious crime boss hovering over all the action. In one sense the film is a traditional whodunit, but as the viewer gets deeper into the story, you not only begin to wonder who did it but what it actually was that he did, since the main story is being told by one of the criminals, and you are never quite sure if he is telling the truth. The screenwriter obviously put a lot of thought into the story, as this is one of the smartest crime films I've ever seen, and it contains surprises for the viewer on a Shyamalanesque scale. It's a joy to watch filmmaking of this caliber, and now I know why the X-Men series has done so well in Singer's capable hands.  <br /> <br />

B000066NW0|2.0|Alright, this CD is not punk.  It is pop.  And a mediochre pop CD at that. <br /> <br />It's good for humming along and tapping your toes.  It is not good if you are looking for music with meaningful lyrics or moving melodies (in fact, lyrics such as \\"I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon\\" make me outright laugh.) <br /> <br />Personally, I think you should listen to a CD if you like the music, regardless of what other people say about the artist.  Period. <br /> <br />And I'll admit, I actually used to listen to this CD a lot when I was, say, 15.  But I've matured and so have my music tastes. <br /> <br />Avril Lavigne is only good for so long.  You eventually out-grow her, as you do with all empty music.
B00004Z400|5.0|Released in 2000, White Pony is still a landmark in popular hard rock, often showing up in various places as one of the best albums of its respective year and even all time. Still, nearly five years later it is considered to be Deftones' masterpiece and the height of their artistic and commercial success. As I type this, Deftones are preparing to release their fifth album, so the future of White Pony's title is unsure, and I think I speak for all Deftones fans when I say that I hope it gets knocked down by the new release. <br /> <br />It's hard to swallow White Pony at points, and it definitely takes time to grow on you, but subsequent listens of the record in its entirety open up its true brilliance. The way White Pony is constructed is confusing, but after breaking it down, it becomes a little more manageable. Basically, it's not a full-blown concept album, but it does have a very conceptual and almost progressive feel throughout, as indicated by the many shifts in styling and song structure, yet retaining a consistent feel. The way I see it, the album can best be described as one piece, with twelve different movements that send it in different directions while managing to keep it all tied together to common thematic elements and various motifs. In its raw instrumentation, this album may not be as complex as a Dream Theater album, but the way it is put together can be just as brilliant if you listen to it in the right way and with an open mind.  <br /> <br />The journey of White Pony is like traveling through a nightmare. It opens the listener up to explore the psyche of a sleeping human mind, the time when little makes sense in the human brain and its functions. In this way, it can best be described as an album that almost makes little sense on the surface, but in a slightly schizophrenic wave of emotion it can take you to places you never thought you could go, and this is illustrated beautifully with Chino's amazing singing and intriguing lyrics. <br /> <br />Back To School opens the album with an offset interpretation of the album's closer. It's important to note the full title, BTS (mini maggit) as will later be described. Though a lot of Deftones fans and otherwise were a little put off by the addition of a radio-friendly, rap-laden song that they felt interrupted the mood of the album, I think it actually adds to the flow and the message of White Pony as a whole. More on this later. <br /> <br />Next is where the nightmare really begins, with the dark Feiticeira, a hectic, free-flowing piece. With a lack of real song structure and a sketchy guitar line, this song builds up to an almost frightening conclusion as Chino whisper/screams \\"Soon I'll let you go\\" over a frantic background of scorching guitars and heavy bass. Frank Delgado makes his grand entrance here as well, with a great complement of wind noises and atmospheric texture that will come to be very prominent on this release. This song is brilliantly able to paint a picture in your mind through Chino's amazing lyrics along with his vocal delivery. The instrumental music is very important as well, as we can feel Chino's interpretation of what's going on in his own mind. This is the famous kidnapping song, and it is a daunting tale. <br /> <br />The final dissonant chord of Feiticeira fades out into a trippy drumbeat of Digital Bath, one of the more popular singles Deftones have released. Despite its apparent radio-friendliness (which is actually not so friendly at all) this is simply an amazing song. On it's own, it's just one of the greatest songs Deftones have ever released. With Chino's soaring vocal lines over heavy two-guitar trade-offs and more atmospheric texture from Delgado, the song is so powerful it leaves me in awe. However, on a scale of White Pony's context, it is merely the next step in the nightmare. This story is that of someone who kills his girlfriend as she bathes by way of electrocution. It's a terrifying premise, but is almost masked by thegreat delivery of the song. The song has two climactic points, one at around 2:30 when the music drops off and the electronic bubble effect (ah, the beauty of motifs) rains down on a bleak guitar line before Chino whispers the haunting \\"You breathed and then you stopped. I breathed and dried you off...\\" at which point the guitar takes over with a screeching harmonic, almost as if the character is screaming on the inside but--just like a nightmare--cannot force it out himself.  <br /> <br />Elite blasts through the speakers next with a very heavy backdrop of spiraling guitars and bass with crashing cymbals laced throughout. This song may seem unlistenable the first time, but after awhile the screaming just melds into the background and you realize what it's there for. It's almost a robotic song (check the breakdown with Chino's voice effects), which solidifies with a later guitar riff that is very syncopated and almost machine-like that ends the song. This song lacks the \\"usual Deftones dynamic,\\" but it still rocks and is important as a flowing piece of the ever-growing nightmare. As to how it fits in, I think it's open for interpretation.  <br /> <br />Immediately following Elite is the more laid-back and moody Rx Queen, which is an extremely bizarre song with heavy percussive effects and stuttering bass. Possibly the simplest guitar song Deftones have written, it is still effective and manages to convey a haunting atmosphere. In short, this song is again almost a frantic plea for help from someone [\\"You're my girl and that's alright, if you sting me I won't mind\\"].  <br /> <br />Street Carp slides in with a brief guitar intro before the band crashes in full force. It's a hard-rock smash similar to Lhabia from Around The Fur. It's a great song, despite the fact that it might at first seem to lack any defining or interesting qualities. It's like a rush of adrenaline in the midst of a calm atmosphere. This is where the beauty of White Pony's construction shines as well, because it almost doesn't make sense being on the album, yet it manages to mold in perfectly with the other songs. Just like a nightmare makes no sense unless you're actually experiencing it. Starting to make sense? <br /> <br />Here is where we see the biggest shift for the rest of the album. It doesn't start declining here, by any means, as it is my opinion that tracks 8-12 are the best on the album and the climax of the record also occurs in that space. However, the central theme is shifted from a fervent dream state into a true twisted nightmare. <br /> <br />The nylon-string opening acoustic riff of Teenager may shock some, given Deftones' track record, but, as has been displayed multiple times both on this album and their previous releases (though in perhaps a more subtle way), Deftones are truly capable of great beauty. This song holds Delgado's most obvious presence, with a scratching line and trip-hop beat that still manages to be more about atmosphere and texture than it does DJ hack-n-slash. Still, it's a mellow trip that makes me think of lying down outside looking at a star-filled sky. It's also a very melancholy ballad of lost love and pensive reflection.  <br /> <br />The next song, Knife Prty is hardly describable by any human words, a masterpiece in and of itself, not to mention in the scope of the entire album. The opening chords lead into a pounding distorted introduction that's just as beautiful as it is heavy. A moving bass line from Chi serves as a great foundation for the chord voicing glory of the guitar riffs and some of Chino's greatest (and most bizarre) lyrics [\\"My knife is sharp and chrome, come see inside my bones. All the fiends of the block, I'm the new king. I'll take the queen.\\"] This song makes you feel like you are moving in slow motion and floating. The chorus contradicts with the verse as the intensity is picked up, a masterful arrangement technique Deftones have slowly perfected in their songs. The bridge is incredible in its weirdness, with the (again) frantic crooning of guest vocalist Rodleen over the bizarre chord progressions from Carpenter. Musical perfection at its finest as the band crashes into the final chorus over an absolutely terrifying shriek. You must hear this song to find its beauty. <br /> <br />Korea bellows in next as one of the heaviest and most dissonant songs on Deftones' catalogue. It's an extremely vague song, lyric-wise, but the haunting atmosphere created by the swirling DJ sound effects and bleak guitar line is very effective and this is a great song. The bridge is one of the highlights on the album, as the bombastic and sliding guitar line leads into the final moment of heaviness that sets the stage for the next song.  <br /> <br />Intensifying sound effects lead up to one of my favorite Deftones guitar riffs ever for the intro of the brilliant Passenger. The dexterous guitar riff and heavy bass boost the shrouded vocal interplay between Maynard (Tool, A Perfect Circle) and Chino as the story unfolds even further, a doomed car ride. The way I see it, this song tells the story of an unwilling victim who is trapped and forced to drive in the dark without any vision of the outside world, but as they begin to go faster and faster, the exhilaration excites the victim and he begins to enjoy it [\\"This time won't you please drive faster.\\"]. It's a twisted song. The dissonant and bleak piano line that lead to the final throws of heavy guitar havoc (and the climax of the album) are intense and dark, giving the image of the car driving off a cliff at top speed. The fading piano that ends the song tinges it with the dark atmosphere that leads into Change. <br /> <br />Change (In The House of Flies) picks up where Passenger left off, a very ghost-like and creepy song. This song was a relatively popular radio hit, but it still is one of the best on the album. Its soaring vocal melodies and metaphorically brilliant lyrics [\\"I watched you change into a fly, I looked away,you were on fire.\\"] convey a message that encompasses the entire album. As for it's true meaning, there's plenty of room for interpretation. This song is heavy, dark, and dissonant but still floating and beautiful. <br /> <br />Pink Maggit is where everything comes together. Back To School, which starts the album, is a spin-off of this song, but it works out nicely as the album starts with it but finishes with Pink Maggit, a more twisted version of it, as displays the course of the album. It's a bleak and moody song with a cool guitar line and a whispered melody from Chino before the band crashes in and allows the album to finish itself with a final explosion.  <br /> <br />Overall, this album is one that will stand strong against the test of time. I think the greatness behind it is in its weird and unorthodox structuring, while also delivering great guitar riffs and a good share of heavy rocking. There's a good amount of symbolism in it as well, which lends it to being an effort for which much discovery is necessary. Its ability to transport you to another place is amazing, and is also where the true talent of Deftones lies, as a creative unit rather than individual instrumentalists. Deftones are closer to mastering their sound with this release, employing more guitar, turntable, and vocal interplay that add to the texture and mood, a feat they would later master on the successor, Deftones. <br />
0671027387|5.0|Deception Point is a book full of suspense, mystery, adventure, and governmental conspiracies. I just couldn't put this book down. I read Deception Point during school, at home, in the car, and if I could read while sleeping, I would have read it then too.  Dan wrote this story in a way that every chapter ends in a cliffhanger, dangling you in the middle of the suspense. His chapters leave you wanting more and more. All of Dan Browns books involve a whirlwind of ideas that you cant decipher what is real and what is fiction. Dan writes so that he uses groups that are real governmental agencies which make you wonder,\\" Could this happen? Has this happened? Will this ever happen?\\" This is Dan's second and best, written book. I have read his other books by Dan Brown and I believe he might become one of the greatest writers of our time.<br /><br /> In Deception Point NASA reports on having found a meteorite that has fossils of \\"alien life.\\" The NRO (National Reconnaissance Office) sends Rachel Sexton, a white house analyst, up to the Arctic Circle to verify its authenticity. In the back round of this discovery, Zachary Herney is President of the United States and is up for re-election. There is no coincidence that Rachel Sexton who is the daughter of the Presidents opponent, Senator Sedgwick Sexton. As all this unfolds, a French scientist is murdered and all of the lives of those in the Arctic Circle are at risk.<br /><br /> The book is the greatest book I have ever read. I don't think that I closed it for mare than and hour. It was intriguing and it enveloped me into the story so I felt that I was right along side Rachel Sexton and her adventure. It will be hard for any writer to write any book better than this.
0385510454|1.0|Do not read this book. More importantly, do not buy this book! If his sales fall sufficiently then perhaps, just perhaps, mind,  we'll be able to convince his publisher and editors not to publish his books anymore until he actually takes the time and effort to write a decent novel. His early books were exciting and entertaining page-turners; his latest books are nothing but dreck. We must stop this.<br />The Broker is full of cardboard characters, who don't have a well-developed personality among them, and is really nothing more than an excuse for a lesson in Italian culture (no cappuchino after 10:30) and how best to learn a language (provided you have the opportunity to immerse yourself in the culture, with a one-on-one tutor). At best, it might have the material for a short story, if he worked on character-development and plot, but it should never have been stretched to novel length.  <br />Grisham can do better; he's proven it with his earlier novels.  Let's encourage him to do better by voting with our wallets. Do not buy his books until he returns to writing books worth reading.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Cab driver Max (expertly played by Jamie Foxx) has been driving a cab for twelve years in Los Angeles, saving up for his dream of creating Island Limousine service.  He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett-Smith) who is working late for the Prosecuting Attorney's office, preparing for a big trial the next day.  When Max gives Annie a speedy ride and pleasant conversation, Annie impulsively hands him her business card.<br /><br />Max then picks up his next fare, a man named Vincent, who says he is only in town for the night on real estate business.  Vincent tells Max he needs to stop at five separate addresses for paper-signings, and winds out hiring Max's cab for the entire evening.  But Vincent is not into real estate, he is an assassin.  When his first hit of the evening inadvertently falls out of a fourth story window and onto Max's waiting cab, Vincent confesses to Max his real profession and orders him to drive him to the remaining four hits.<br /><br />When Max asks Vincent what he is, Vincent replies, \\"I'm Indifferent.\\"  Indifferent is a kind word for Vincent, he is a cold and ruthless sociopath, and expert in his field with a reputation for getting the job done.  Max is in over his head, stunned and shaken by the brutality that has entered his world, and desperate to find a way out of his situation without really knowing how to achieve such a feat against such a monster.<br /><br />Get ready for some truly spectacular performances in this tension filled film.  Vincent is a new type of role for Cruise, that he carries out with amazing believability and casual elegance.  Jamie Foxx outperforms himself as Max, highlighting the superior actor under the hilarious comedian.  Jada Pinkett-Smith's role as Annie was fairly small, but stands out because of her excellent performance.<br /><br />Can Max survive this hellish night?  Will Vincent achieve his merciless mission?  Is there any rhyme or reason to the selection of his victims?  How does Annie tie into Vincent's plans?  Just because the plot to this movie can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs does not mean that it is in any way boring or predictable.  `Collateral' is a tense thriller, with a tight script, great performances, rapid action bursts, and enough mental friction to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />My hat is also off to Michael Mann for his superb directing skills, bringing back memories of Manhunter and Miami Vice as he expertly melds audio to visual, creating that sensory indulgence so unique to Mann's work.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie whether you are in the mood for action, thrills, or tension.  Pick yourself up a copy, it's a buyer.  Enjoy!Vincent's plans?

B000060MMI|5.0|A beautiful mix of Irish Folk and punk. It has the prose, subject matter and original intruments of Irish Folk music along with electicity, the edge of punk. The best of the 3 Flogging albums. They'll have you thumbin' your nose at the English in No time. <br />And just an afterthought, they are the greatest live band I have ever heard.
0066211697|4.0|Any lover of the French must read the coming of age tale of Celine.  Written in 1954, Bounjour Tristesse was novel and took on issues of young love and jealously that seemed ahead of it's time.   Now, the book may feel a bit passe, but for understanding the author and time it was written-- it remains a classic.
B0007P3582|4.0|How can u give this album less than 3 stars, it has 21 tracks and all of them are worthy listens.  50 hasn't gone too RnB as there are more street songs than club or rnb songs.  The production is excellent, not all of them are catchy initially which can be a good thing. <br /> <br />Don't listen to others complaining about the album for no reason, there is a reason why it sold 1 mill plus. <br /> <br />If u like commercial rap this is a must have.   <br />It's 2050!!!! <br /> <br />
B000660UN0|4.0|When Clapton diverges from the blues he often sounds lacklustre. When he tries too hard, same result. It's interesting that he thought his \\"unplugged\\" was not fit for release, but the rawness and warmth earnt it a grammy. \\"Me And Mr Johnson\\" was a litlle to \\"mannered\\" and \\"polished\\". Hre he plays and sings as a real blues musician, just as he did on \\"From The Cradle\\". <br />One question for \\"Mr.Get Real\\". How did you transfer the DVD audio tracks to audio CD? My software won't co-operate so far

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|It has the slightest hint of sexy edge beneath all the poppiness, or maybe I'm just reading into it too much. But anyway, awesome CD.
0316172324|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, both from a business (I own a Web site development business) and a personal perspective.  The book gives the reader some keen insights as to the important nuances and peculiarities of our minds that are evident all the time.  I was very impressed with how extensive the research was and how well orchestrated the content was.  Gladwell's obvious writing talent allows him to smoothly weave an argument/narrative together the same way Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld used to write episodes of Seinfeld.   <br /> <br />I think that those who have been critical of this book have mistaken Gladwell's intention.  He hasn't set out to establish definitive scientific theory.  Instead, he's tried to give us several important glimpses of how our minds function and left the application to us.  In this respect, I feel, the book is extremely worthwhile.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|it's very comforting to know that music of this caliber is still being made. madeleine is definitely the billie holiday of our generation. it's probably best that you buy this cd now. i recommend it.
0790737345|5.0|I LOVED this movie, Meg and Nicholas give great performances, I especially enjoyed Nicholas in this film, his portrayal of innocense, honesty, vulnerability made me want to take care of him and I totally  fell in love with him. Fabulous movie, watch it with a box of kleenex handy....
B0002X314C|5.0|I think he's the guy equivalent of Alicia Keys. He is so talented and it is evident through his music. The only issue I have is the lyrical content of some of his songs. I just can't get with listening to somebody making excuses for cheating or disrespecting another couple's relationship, but that's my personal beef. The second half of the cd is very strong lyrically, musically, vocally... this guy is just on point! If you are tired of the musical drivel on the radio today, this is the cd to buy; you won't be disappointed. He's just what the doctor ordered!
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Though I hate Meg's hair this short I have to say that this movie is fantastic! I've watched almost all of her romantic comedies and this is definetly one of the best. She is funny, charming, great.I was amazed at her resemblance with Melanie Griffith. However i didn't like Kevin as her final love interest,I don't know...they had good chemistry but..mmm there's just something there that didn't click for me. I would LOVE to see a re-make of this film and I would have Oliver Martinez playing Luc and possibly Julia Roberts as Kate. I don't know after I watch a movie or read a book I always like to think who I'd cast in the roles to make the movie or book perfect, is that weird??? <br />:) anyways great movie. 5 stars
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I really enjoy this cd! Of course the music is light and fun, but that has always been a great quality of Shania's music (at least in my opinion). Even though I'm not a big fan of the country music sound, I found myself enjoying her earlier singles which have less of a pop influence and actually sound better to me. Shania just has a universal appeal that crosses all boundaries and that's why she has been so successful in her musical career. Great cd to listen to while driving, cooking or doing some spring cleaning!
B00003CX5P|5.0|OK, this was not \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" or \\"Return of the Jedi\\". The reason people had so much trouble with this movie was they were looking for Luke and Lea, Han Solo, and the characters they were familiar with. <br /> <br />What George Lucas is doing is practicing a brand new concept in the movies known as \\"art imitates life\\". Star Wars is a generational film in a sense that it is giving us an image of the same family in different times in history. No, you will not the swaggering Han Solo making his wonderful one liners, or Luke saving the day with his light saber. The characters weren't born yet. Darth Vader was only a child at this time. <br /> <br />A wonderful analogy is a family tree. Let's say you can travel back in time to the 1940s. You will not find yourself there or the people you know. You will find your grandparents or parents as teenagers or as young children along with a population that would be totally unrecognizable. The political situations would be totally different, the villains would be different, and even the general way of thinking among the people would be different. It is your world, but it would not be your world. <br /> <br />This situation, when viewed on the movie screen, would bother many, many people which would make the movie hard to adjust to.  <br /> <br /> <br />OK! Some things on the movie could have been better. Jar Jar Binks could have been a LOT less aggravating than he was. Yes, there could have been just a bit LESS talk at the political conferences and more action.  <br /> <br />Still, there were wonderful highlights. It was very refreshing to see Jabba the Hutt again along with the great race. The creatures who were to be the competitors were hilarious. <br /> <br />Ian McDiarmid was back, playing a dual role as both Darth Sidius and Palpatine, the human would LATER become the evil emporer. Although McDiarmid looked too human this time he still had the wonderful wit of the emperor and was enjoyable to see.  <br /> <br />All in all, it is a wonderful movie to see to look for memorable characters and to view the Star Wars' parallel universe that we wanted to know about in the original trilogy.
B00008EY7H|5.0|This was excellent! I have never seen a CdS show live, but I'm looking forward to seeing one really soon since I saw this! The camera angles are superb and the sound is excellent. The Grand Finale and the Grand Entrance is spectacular. I recommend this for everyone! I am looking forward to buying Quidam also!
6305428352|5.0|This movie follows the life of a frustrated composer (played to perfection by Richard Dreyfuss) who couldn't earn a full-time living as a band member. The movie begins when he starts a new career as the music teacher at a small-town high school to pay his rent.  He quickly comes to realize it's not only high school students who don't want to be in class, but also their teachers. A succession of very unmusical students beg him to find a way to teach them, as hopeless as they appear to be, to become competent at their instruments.  This forces him to dig much deeper into the teens' psyche and his own soul to invent ways to help the teens succeed.  I found it very admirable the way he learned to control his verbal responses to kids who seemed so untalented and so far beyond the possibility of redemption. He exercised great restraint and came up with responses to them that were honest yet challenged the teens in a positive way to  discover possibilities no one would have believed they were capable of. As the parent of a teen, I can tell you this is very hard to do, and I really appreciated the lesson the movie teaches by example!  I found it very inspiring the way these experiences impacted the teens involved as they grew to adulthood and beyond, and I believe such lessons could be very impactful on junior high age students who may be struggling in one subject or another at school, and on their parents.  I'd highly recommend this film to benefit the parents of kids in the 10 to 16 years of age range, as well as to junior and senior high school teachers of any subject.      The story also shows how he inspires one very talented student, aptly played by the lovely Jean Louisa Kelly, to discover her inner voice and pursue her musical ambitions. To me, this film would have been worth seeing on the strength of her charming performance and beautiful singing voice alone. I think she'd make a great ingenue as Christine in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, for example,and I hope she gets that opportunity some day.  I'd also love to see and hear her opposite Josh Groban performing a musical duet, that would be magical indeed.
6303402348|4.0|Academy Award winner Tom Hanks, accompanied by Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn, delivers an emotional roller coaster of a performance in the 1994 Paramount Studio release directed by Robert Zemeckis titled Forrest Gump.  <br />Forrest Gump garnered six Academy Awards including Best Visual Effects, Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Tom Hanks. <br />Mr. Hanks portrays a man whose lack of intelligence is overshadowed by the size of his heart as he deals with the circumstances that is his life.  <br />As a young boy, Forrest is diagnosed with Scoliosis and is fitted with braces for his legs. Little did young Forrest realize, that those braces on his legs would change his life as they helped correct his posture. They helped him meet Jenny, played by Robin Wright Penn, who provides many firsts for Forrest as they continue their friendship through the film. As Jenny provides the famous three words, Run Forrest Run, to Forrest's first encounter with manhood, she becomes the main inspiration for Forrest as he makes his way through college and into the Vietnam War where he encounters Bubba and Lieutenant Dan which earns an Academy Award Nomination for Gary Sinise in his portrayal of the man who wanted to die on the battlefield but ended up being a man with \\"New Legs.\\"  <br />The special effects that are used for the battle scenes and the brief encounters with President Kennedy, President Nixon, John Lennon, and into the middle of desegregation in the south provide for a humorous and light-hearted break from the otherwise tense scenes into which they are intertwined.  <br />I give Forrest Gump a four and a half out of five stars for the special effects, the soundtrack, and the emotional content that each actor and actress is able to bring out in their characters. For young and old alike, this movie is definitely worth the one hundred and forty one minutes that is Forrest Gump. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCW|5.0|As someone once said, this is \\"the only film masterpiece narrated by a corpse.\\" William Holden plays a scriptwriter down on his luck who, while being chased in his car by a couple of bill collectors, pulls into the driveway of 10086 Sunset Boulevard. The driveway leads to an old \\"white elephant\\" of a mansion which belongs to silent screen star Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson). She offers him a job rewriting a script for her \\"comeback\\"; before long he's her kept man. Swanson is stunning as this mad screen star lost in the dreamworld of her past glory. When Holden has finally had it up to here and packs to clear out, she shoots him! The final scene, with Swanson no longer in touch with reality, has her floating down the staircase as if making a screen entrance to adoring crowds, is a total knockout: it's a classic movie scene. The whole picture reeks with decay and disillusionment: the rats in the empty swimming pool, the bed shaped like a huge boat, the New Years Eve party for 2, the silent film screenings--everything; you can almost smell it. A fascinating movie.
0743454529|3.0|I thought that the content of the book was amazing.  I really like how the author really delved into hot ethical issues, and even gave us the every day aspects of the lives of the family of a sick child.  For example, while I found myself so wrapped up with the \\"what ifs\\" that the book posed, the author reminded us that the parents of this child would even have the added stress of dealing with an unsympathetic insurance company. <br /> <br />However, despite how gripping the material was, the story, I found was predictable and falsly climactic.  It seemed that almost every chapter ended with a manufactured suspenseful note.  I finished the book in two days, and while I enjoyed it, I found that the author was trying too hard for drama--including the twist at the end. <br /> <br />It's a good read, and it allows the reader to really think and question him or herself, but it's somewhat disappointing fictionally.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I really liked My Chemical Romance's interpretation of Rock. They give the new generation a chance to have individuality. Sure, it may attract more of the headbangers, but kids and teenagers these days, are so wrapped up on all that Rap music and Pop... but this is so original. People love to compare a lot of newcomers to older bands and other newcomers. But I think that the member of MCR bring something new to the table and aren't afraid to say what they want in their lyrics. Most people wouldn't say some of the things lead singer, Gerrard, would say... because people don't think the audiences are ready for it. But I think they came just in time. Look at ROCK in a new light, and stop being so afraid of it... MCR came in the nick of time to give rock music a new name and you a new perspective on it. <br />
1400031524|4.0|Henning Mankell's \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" was written in 1992, around the time of the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.  While the novel was certainly topical at the time, it wasn't one of his best efforts.  In atypical fashion, \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" does not feature intensive character development which is a Mankell hallmark.  As a consequence of this it is difficult to empathize with the plight of his characters.  Mankell in this book exchanges the usual dreary southern Swedish locale for a drearier environment in Latvia.  Unfortunately police inspector Kurt Wallander seems out of sync when not in his familiar Ystaad location.<br /><br />Wallander becomes involved in an unusual investigation when two well dressed corpses wash ashore in a lifeboat on the outskirts of town.  Pathologic examination of the bodies as well as the boat point to both eminating from one of the Russian Baltic states.  Wallander is soon joined in his investigation by Latvian police inspector Major Karlis Liepa.  Working well together they discover that the dead men were members of the drug smuggling Latvian underworld.  The investigation is relinquished to Latvian authorities and Major Liepa returns home.  Wallander has officially wahed his hands of the affair when he shockingly learns that Major Liepa has been murdered.<br /><br />Latvian authorities summon Wallander to aid them in solving the murder of Liepa.  He arrives in Riga where the police department is commanded by two colonels Putnis and Murniers.  He soon learns that the police department suffers from massive corruption and is affiliated with the criminal underworld.  The ethical Liepa was killed to prevent his from blowing the whistle on the corruption.  While investigating in Riga, Wallender becomes enamored with Liepa's widow Baiba.<br /><br />The novel proceeds as Wallender continues to probe while the whole political structure in Latvia is undergoing a major upheaval as the Communist government is crumbling.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|This album is not bad; if you like the wall album, then you will like this album because it is an extension of the wall. This album doesn't even come close to there great albums such as darkside and wish you were here. The album is ok at best and don't expect any thing like there work form the 70s. Floyd is my favorite band and I have a lot of respect for there ever evolving music but I would like them to actually return to playing good rock music. If you are a Floyd fan, then go out and get but don't have high expectations. And if you are Roger Waters fan then I am sure you will enjoy. <br /> <br /> <br />
6305313687|3.0|It has been many years since I have seen this film. My memory attested it to be an excellent picture that meaningfully discussed issues as heavy as race relations, prejudice, and hatred. Unfortunately my memory is a little at fault, and upon viewing it this time I found it a bit disappointing. The film sets its sights to the heavens, and while succeeding in many ways, it could not attain such a lofty height. In trying to cover all the basis in such a thorny issue as race relations it cheats a bit in its storytelling. But we'll cover more of that in a bit.    The plot involves a young, white Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and the tumultuous 24 hours after his release from prison for killing two black men, while they were trying to steal his car. Much of the story is told in a flash backed black and white. Here we learn that Derek was a Neo-Nazi skinhead leader who has had a change of heart after his stint in prison. Post prison time is being spent trying to keep his brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. A path he is already walking down.    This is a powerful, moving film. Reading the boards on IMDB will attest to lives being changed through watching it. It works best when it shoots for an emotional response, rather than an intellectual one. Scenes such as when Edward Nortan's skin head leader rallies the troops to loot a local grocer, or the opening scene where we see Norton kill the two aforementioned black men, or a traumatic rape scene in prison, emit a guttural response from its viewers. It is in such scenes that we are rallied into discourse on the issues presented. Yet when the film gets talky it falls short of its ideals. It presents nothing beyond the general rhetoric you can find just about anywhere. In fact most of the rhetoric is spewed from the Neo-Nazi skinheads, and this type of discussion can be found every other day on day time talk shows. There is little in way of discussion from the rational, unprejudiced mind.    There are two powerful performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. At this point Norton was already beginning to take his role as the new Robert DeNiro, who had previously taken his turn as the new Marlon Brando. Let's hope he escapes the fate of mediocrity that they fell into. Furlong who once made Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier with such a wooden performance, here has finally made himself worthy of attention. He gives a fine performance here, as a young man struggling with the passionate feelings of youth.    Tackling an issue as heady as racism in America is a worthy, yet difficult cause. It proves to be too much for first time screenwriter David McKenna and director Tony Kaye. Trying to condense their story into regulation movie time they either skipped over completely or barely touched on some important issues. To give reasons for Derek's turn as a skinhead we are only allowed one small dinner table conversation with his father who spews some hateful race sentiments. This and his fathers murder at the hands of black addicts in a crackhouse, whom he was trying to save from a fire must suffice for an intelligent, middle class youths turn into a Nazi. Likewise his subsequent salvation in prison is not dwelt on enough to give us sufficient reasons for this turn of heart. Yes, the skinheads in prison are hypocrites, and yes the rape scene is brutal enough to turn away from their midst. But, his relationship with the black coworker, Lamont (Guy Torry) is not enough to change the heart of such hatred. Torry gives a fine performance, and does enough to show Derek that all blacks aren't as vile as the rhetoric made him believe, but are jokes about sex really going to make a skinhead believe in the goodness of the black race?    In searching for a cause behind the Neo-Nazi scene in America the filmmakers seem to point directly towards the intense feelings of anger found in adolescence and the need to fit in with some social group. And rightly, these twoissues play powerfully on the minds of many in the skinhead culture. But the issue goes deeper than this, and it is here, again, that this film misses the mark. Just as Derek dismisses issues of poverty, and social position in the plight of the black man this film seems to skim over some of the deeper motivation behind racism.    Don't get me wrong. This is a powerful, well made film. There is plenty to chew upon and discuss. It is, in fact, a good film to watch with others and bring into light an important debate. Yet when I watch it I can't help but think of how it could have been better, how it could have reached the heights it was reaching for.    (...)
6305657947|5.0|For anyone who has not seen the original Thomas Crown Affair I would highly recommend it. I have seen the current version countless times and watched the original for the first time last week. Pierce Brosnan owns the role of Thomas Crown which should be suggested by the upcoming sequel \\"The Topkapi Affair\\". Mcqueen had a tough time relaxing in the original like Brosnan does so easily. The idea of stealing a piece of art in the middle of the day is also much more interesting than a bank robbery, although it was well orchestrated. I was glad to see that Crown was actually involved in the heist this time around. The locations of the second one make you feel like you are there. From Crown's apartment to the Cipriani restaurant, to Martinique the films locations spice everything up just enough. I enjoyed the fact that the movies shared many seens like the golfing and the glider planes. It is imperitive that you see both versions to truly appreciate how good both films are. It is a relief to know that we can still see movies with some class even today.
B0007O38F8|2.0|I have righteously owned and earnestly listened to The Massacre for more than a full week. Despite my personal appreciation for 50's talent of shameless self-promotion, I was rather indifferent to this record at the time of release. Not to say I was disloyal like The Game (I was totally committed to shelling out dough for The Massacre) I just didn't expect this G-Unit offering to be the best album of the (young) year. I stayed coyly uncommitted for two reasons. Obviously The Massacre is a sophomore album and I personally find that most sophomore albums lack the passion and innovation of the debut record (few exceptions being Supreme Clientele by Ghostface, One in a Million by Aaliyah, Rebel Yell by Billy Idol).  <br />The more important reason why I had lowered any expectations is because I really had no sense of the artist's direction with The Massacre based on the radio friendly singles that Fiddy's been dutifully pumping out. It seemed to contradict the battle rap notoriousness of the anticipated Piggy Bank track. Truth be told, I am much more of a fan of the smug thugged-out intensity of 50, which is satisfyingly convincing, than his seemingly half-hearted attempts at times to sing the chorus on every groupie luv track and club hit. <br />Shady/Aftermath knows how to sell records to a mass market with these singles, however they really push the envelope with 50 in comparison to Eminem. Em's first single off any of his releases is always catchy and tongue-in-cheek yet the singles still convey the insolence and sarcasm that is Eminem. The 50 Cent singles are catchy too, but never indicate the execration, the imprecation that allows me to enjoy the explicit Mr. P.I.M.P. The singles are like red herrings, you want to hear the new offering from 50 Cent but you really don't get true 50. It's more swagger than swearing and 'two-step with a lil twist' as opposed to any hint of rivalry and derision. At least, I can applaud 50's ability to pimp his record as a corporate artist on federally-regulated, corporate-owned radio, but please give me a \\"Wanksta\\"-type single!! <br />No more preaching, no more talk about corporate control and radio-airplay, although it is impossible to separate 50 from the media conglomerate template he is slotted into, this is a review of The Massacre. Obviously I'm not enthusiastic about \\"Candyshop\\" (might as well be \\"Magic Stick\\", true indeed) and \\"Disco Inferno\\", strictly speaking in terms of club-oriented singles, neither of these tracks are as hot as \\"In Da Club\\", nor are they as hot as \\"Lean Back\\" was from this summer. \\"Candyshop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" are just not as lively as those popular overworked overtures. Unfortunately I found that there were more songs that were less than invigorating. 50 treads over \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\" with chilly aloofness minus a good chorus despite the curiously exotic beat by Scott Storch. \\"So Amazing\\" (featuring Olivia of G-Unit, the Candyshopping cross-eyed (watch the video!) chanteuse) is formulaic, pairing a restrained 50 with an unexceptional female voice. <br />I'm saving my sincerest criticism for \\"Piggy Bank\\". Geez, what a disappointment. As the lead-off street mixtape track, \\"Piggy Bank\\" has been publicized with much ballyhoo as the infamous beef track. It really is more of a boast track than beef, as 50 is bragging about record sales to outshine his targets. 50 is totally right when he uses this measure to demarcate himself from his targets, but his contention is not intimidating or frightening. I would have expected this beef track from 50 to be more \\"How to Rob\\", with strong-arm bulldozing and bluster. Instead his dispute is splashy squabbling. If anything, this weak track will open the floodgates for more inspired dis rap from the better writers he is ridiculing. If Shyne, Jadakiss, Nas and Fat Joe allow a track innocuously named \\"Piggy Bank\\" to frighten them into submission or obedience, it would really be shameful. Common had \\"The Bitch in You\\", 2Pac had \\"Hit 'em Up\\", even Canibus had \\"2nd Round K.O.\\", and Fiddy comes with a nursery rhyme hook and a silly name that does not connote spite for his rivals. I expected bang but got something dim and forceless. <br />Despite my tone so far, it's not all missteps on The Massacre. The hottest tracks are \\"Ski Mask Way\\" with that head-nodding Disco D beat (Is this the same raunchy Disco D who crafted A Night at the Booty Bar? Incredible!). 50 recites the tried and true 'make money' slogan with earnest appeal. \\"Ski Mask Way\\" rumbles with both bass and the threat of force, making it the gangsta track with the most presence on this album. \\"My Toy Soldier\\" shines because of the inspired verses from Tony Yayo and 50. While Tony Yayo reinforces his standing as the most lyrically talented member of G-Unit, 50 timely spits combative lyrics that appear to point out treachery within his camp. On \\"Ryder Music\\" the slick 50 vocals compliment the polished smooth beat from Hi-Tek. The ominous Dr. Dre/Elizondo beat behind \\"Gunz Come Out\\" is perfect for the grim guntalk mantra that 50 croons. The final track \\"Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Remix)\\" is really a bonus track in more than just name. 50 and The Game (pre-beef, pre-truce) are solid. The rest of G-Unit competently work over the soulful beat without overpowering it with their eager voices, but the true bonus here flows from Lloyd Banks. His ongoing improvement as a writer is significant because Lloyd already has a great method of delivering his darts.  <br />I did find \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" to be successful in its message and manner. I think that personification rap is generally appealing because the artist is engaged in a blended role-playing approach that allows them to probe different sentiments while they are exploring fantasy. They don't necessarily have to be themselves while they inhabit the object but the artist's imagination is always the main component. As crack cocaine (or is it heroin? Does it even matter?), 50 Cent does a good job delving into the destructive romanticism of addiction. It's been a long running theme in music and 50 rhymes within the same vein as Neil Young when the latter trolls on \\"Needle and the Damage Done\\" ('I caught you knockin' at my cellar door/ I love you, baby, can I have some more') or as like Velvet Underground on their \\"Heroin\\" ('Heroin, be the death of me/ Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life'). Fiddy makes the song cautionary in it's message by maintaining a brutish victimizing tone that just simply works. <br />The album is not an improvement over 50's debut. I'm not a fan of artistically static efforts from rappers in the industry, but I would have liked The Massacre to be Get Rich... I want just one track like \\"21 Questions\\" and 15 proper gangsta tracks that hit their mark. The album could have been pared down 5-6 tracks to allow it to be a release that I could play from beginning to end. I initially agreed with the review in the April XXL magazine by Anslem Samuel in which he basically inferred that after Get Rich or Die Trying, 50 got rich and stopped trying. 50 hasn't stopped trying to be the most conspicuous rapper, but he doesn't try to offer anything innovative. In fact, his sound and attitude is diluted by the r&b influenced songs that thin an already stagnant effort. While he is great at promoting himself and giving his album popular exposure, he does not push himself to cultivate his craft. I hope for his next album, 50 will work on delivering a stronger effort as opposed to pitching urban apparel, Reeboks, and vitaminwater. <br /> <br />
B00000JLWW|2.0|Titanic was just a maudlin, over-acted, cliche. The love story in this movie was so predictable. The moments of highest emotion between Jack and Rose were a little nauseating. The acting was stilted. In the end I was cheering for the iceberg. <br /> <br />The special effect were pretty cool, however. That couldn't make up for a lame story.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I titled my review \\"The End of Star Trek\\" based on other reviews of this movie. When first released I watched it in the theaters as a gift from my son and , although recovering from a massive heart attack earlier in the year plus being seated on the 1st row of the theater, I managed to enjoy a very profound movie. Granted the death of Data smacked of another death in the Star Trek family(Spock) and the revenge of the main villian smacked of another revenge seeker(Khan),I'm still found my interested peaked. The special effects were great as were the overall roles of all the characters. So the sales sucked and the movie panned out, but, no reason to kill the saga of Star Trek. The opening for further adventures using Will Ricker has finally come. Let's develop this and remember \\"Nemesis\\" as the launching point for yet another Star Trek era.
1582403589|5.0|I love this series, yes it's a typical Romero Zombie story. But that's what makes it so good. The story line in excellently written. Basically if you LOVE zombies and zombie stories. Then pick this up.
B0007GADZO|5.0|The album from top to bottom is great...yes there is some new directions taken and I understand some people dont get the story and so on and so forth...but hey...Listen to the CD and forget the story if it confuses you.<br /><br />I think Vai's Vocals have improved tremendously on this album as well. For any Vai fan out there this is deffinately worth picking up. You wont be dissapointed.
B0007O38F8|2.0|Although I had certain dissatisfactions with 50cents earlier album, \\"Get Rich or Die Trying,\\" I eventually grew to like that record and consider it an above average piece of musical work. That album, however, looks like a priceless Mozart symphony on a wax cylinder when compared to 50cent's latest effort, \\"The Massacre.\\" <br /> <br />Where to begin with this album? 50cent seems to have found nothing new to rap about beyond guns, how much sex he allegedly has, how \\"classy\\" people dont like him (gee, I can't imagine why), how he considers himself rap's Jesus, repeating the \\"Geee-UNIT!\\" catchphrase every few seconds, and how he is ready to lay out any gangster who thinks they are more of a gangster than he himself is. <br /> <br />For such a tough gangster, 50cent seems to spend an awful lot of time and effort trying to come up with cute, radio-friendly pop hooks for his songs (listen to the boring, idiotic \\"Candy Shop\\" and see for yourself). Also, for such a tough gangster, 50 does an awful lot of moronic grinning into the microphone during live performances, which, I must say, are terrible! For someone who likes to think of himself as Tupac Shakur Jr., 50 has no lyrical or vocal flexibility -- all his rhymes (if they can be called that) are delivered in a monotone, low-decibel drawl that sounds more like some random guy rapping quietly along with a song on the radio while on the way to work, rather than a famous artist himself delivering vocals for a studio album. <br /> <br />I'd give this CD 1 star but I must admit I do enjoy hearing \\"G-UNIT!\\" because I haven't tired of the catchprase yet. Ask me again in a month and I'll probably take back that extra star I gave 50 and give it to Nas instead.
B00000JKH2|5.0|From the first lo-fi beats of Rascuache, to the spine-tingling vocal finale on 198d, this album is seriously compelling.  I got this EP after I got hooked on The Mars Volta.  The lyrics are compelling. <br /> <br />/What if forensics find the answer <br />/What if they stole my fingerprints <br />/Where did I leave my book of matches <br />/We'll find you <br /> <br />Get this EP.  If you only get one ATDI cd, get this one.  If I hadn't got this one first, I probably would not like ATDI.  If you got some of their earlier cd's, and can't get into it, trust me and get this one.  It will put them in a new perspective.
B000003TA4|5.0|Certainly the finest rock disc of the last 15 years.  Took the world in a different direction.  Rocks hard, a bit of punk edge, but has catchy melodies and words you can sing along to.  Enjoy.   <br /> <br />An average of 4 stars prompted me to add my weight to the high end.  Get over the fact that it is still overplayed on the radio, many years later.  It's still great.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It was a Long time in coming, however, now the DVD dream is a reality!  I was expecting for the set to be released after Revenge of The Sith, thakfully Lucas gave in to preasure and we have the set for our digital viewing pleasure. <br />  First off, we all know by now that this set is not going to make all purists happy since our last chance to get these films untouched was back in 1995 with the THX transfers.  In addition, we all know that there is a hardcore group of nerds that like to see George Lucas put on trial for treason after doing the major overhaul on Episode IV. <br />  With that said, after this new prequel trilogy, The first STAR WARS can now better stand next to them. Hell, the first was far from what we saw in EMPIRE And JEDI, in terms of specail FX!  It need touching . . .  and not in the Michael Jackson kind of way! <br />  A NEW HOPE is a joy to watch on my big screen.  The sound makes my windows rattel.  The Specail Edition parts are better than in 1997 with a a Jabba The Hut that is closer to the one that appeared in Episode I.  I know the Catina shooting scene is still in there.  Much to the dismay of nerds still living in their parents basements.  But, this is a much better presentation than what was transfered onto VHS.  Some parts don't match the rest of the film, I know, yet it's still better and closer to what Lucas wanted in the first place. <br />  The other two films are just as packed with sound and refinments that, in my opinion were not fully finished in their 1997 re-release.  The blue screen problems that were never really fixed ( even though They said they were)In the hoth scene are gone. No AT-AT legs overlapping through the cockpit canopy.  The only thing that bugged me was the new over dubs for Bobba Fett.  It makes sense to use Jango's, but, the old voice had a grit to it that is kinda lost. <br />  The big thing that made no sense was to give poor dialogue to the revised scene where Vader learns that Luke is his son.  Again, I see the point in making Palpatine like he did the other films.  It just stuck out like a gay man at a G. W. Bush rally.  the new lines kinda take away from the fact that we were kinda let to believe that Vader was obbsessed with finding Luke becuase he already knew he had a son fighting against him.   <br />  Now to JEDI, still contains of the best dog fight scene's in motion picture history.  On the techinal side all the blue screen stuff is smoother.  No lines at all to tell this was superimposed.  Another thing that was never really fixed in 1997 was the Rancor pit scene with Luke.  You could still see the heavy black lines on the monster.  All gone now . . . thank God! <br />  Some people don't like the new young jedi Anakin at the end.  But, I thought it was touching for Luke to see the man that was and only heard about.   <br />  If you're going to get this set, and you damn well should, get it on Widescreen.  For those of use that lived on Fullscreen for 25+ years one would be astonished on how so much was cut off the sides or Pan scanned out of our view.  It's almost like watching <br />a whole new trilogy! <br />  Don't forget, this has the trailers, TV spots, \\"Empire Of Dreams\\", a look at the new movie, and the demo for the \\"Battlefront\\" game for the X box!
1594200106|5.0|This book was an absolute delight and joy to read.<br /><br />Summary, no spoilers:<br /><br />The book starts out in 1945 in Barcelona, when 11 year old Daniel Sempere wakes up and panics when he discovers that he cannot remember his deceased mother's face.<br /><br />His father then decides to take him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a wondrous (and magical?) place where Daniel is allowed to pick out one book to keep. He chooses The Shadow of the Wind, a novel by a man named Julian Carax.<br /><br />Daniel discovers that someone is trying to burn all of Carax's books, and he tries to find out why.<br /><br />Big time adventure ensues, as Daniel tries to figure out the puzzle that is Carax's life....which at many times mirrors Daniel's own circumstances.<br /><br />This novel is not only an exciting tale of intrigue and adventure, it is also VERY funny. Daniel has a sidekick named Fermin, who is truly one of the most witty and memorable characters in literature.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough. It was a peak reading experience for me, and I found myself deliberately reading it in small bites so that I wouldn't finish.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Don't even try to take this movie seriously. Just kick back and enjoy it for what it is: campy fun. It's all just silly escapism that can be highly enjoyable with some popcorn and a beverage, but hell there's nothing wrong with that!
B0007O38F8|1.0|this cd has proven that 50 cent has officially sold out and is all about the money...i was a big fan of 50 before he became popular because of his clever lyrics...this album is just complete garbage and is a disgrace to the rap industry...
B00006AW2E|2.0|I loved it that ABKCO released several of the classic Rolling Stones catalog from the 60's in the British versions as well as the more familiar American albums.  In the case of Aftermath in particular, the buyer gets a much better album than the American version.  I also bought the UK versions of Between the Buttons and Out of Our Heads.  The latter purchase was a big disappointment however.  In general, the sound quality has been extraordinary on the ABKCO releases on hybrid SACD.  Out of Our Heads UK is the exception.  The sound quality is muddy and extremely low fi.  I am assuming that the original masters must be in poor condition, because other albums from the same period, like Big Hits, High Tide Green Grass sound fine.  I applaud the idea of releasing the British Out of Our Heads album, because it is a cool selection of cover tunes and Jagger/Richards originals, but the atrocious sound quality makes it a bad purchase choice.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Who wants a movie where the \\"main\\" victim gets the grand punishment and everyone else seems to go on their merry way?! I don't like being left frustrated, disatisfied and sickened with the ending. I want some justification. I don't want a story to just move me, alot of times Hollywood thinks that's the definition of success. I want to be left with some feeling of power in the end for the victim. I want to be left with hope. This movie bummed me out big time!  I didn't have the DVD with the comments included so I don't know if some of the mysteries were addressed.  The one abductor's cross ring and the fact his face and demeanor looked like a stereotypical Irish priest, was that a satire on the scandals of priests now in the news today?  Did the cross have another significance as a tattoo on Sean Penn's character's back?  Did the two cross's have a joint significance? What's with the numbered tattoo on his hand?  I'd appreciate anyone speaking on my points. Everyone else just seems to tell the main plot of the story. Repetitious!  If you're not going to add or ask something new, why write!
B000069KGM|5.0|The Coltrane-loving reviewer who hates this album really needs to pull his head out of his.... well, behind. I'm happy for the guy that he loves jazz. It's great that he loves John Coltrane. He has every right to hate this album. However, to hate this album for not being jazz would be like hating Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water for not being folk. This is a rock album with a kick-butt horn section. The writing is inventive. The singing is outstanding. The horn section punctuates the tunes the way a great horn section should. And Terry Kath.....  Well, he really wails on the guitar. Don't listen to the music Nazis. If you love great rock music, you need to check out this album!

6304458223|5.0|The first time I saw this film in school, I was amazed by its simple beauty, unfortunately, that time I saw it I hadn't had the chance to see it throughly, I basically missed both the opening and the ending.  I was lucky enough once to catch it on TV, however I still didn't get to watch the opening that time.  I once ran into it at my local video store, for just about five dollars so I decided to buy it. <br /> <br />I was very pleased with this film, I finally got the chance to watch it throughly and I am very glad I did, I'm also glad I own it so I can watch it any time.  I've seen the film many times since I bought it, each time I watch it, I like it more and more.  The story is about a 13-year-old girl who's just lost her mother, now living with her father she struggles to adjust to a new life in Canada.  However, that changes the day she finds a group of orphaned goose eggs and becomes their loving mother. <br />Later, the geese are born, everything is fine.  However, the geese need to fly south for the winter and that is not going to be an easy task for them as they have no real goose mother to lead them the way.  Some neighboors try to help by taking the ability to fly away from the geese, but Amy (Our little Mother Goose) does not approve of that.  Her father has a much better idea, build a sort of flying machine for him and for Amy, which they will use to fly the geese south, a plan they whole-heartedly hope will work. <br /> <br />The movie is beautifully filmed, the settings and backgrounds are breathtaking, very pretty.  The film is caressed by lovely melodies, some upbeat and happy, some sad and slow.  A gorgeous song, \\"Ten Thousand Miles\\" opens the film in a kind of slow, heartly way.  The actors and actrices do a wonderful job of portraying their characters, all of them are very believable.  There are several elements of humor and fun scattered through the film, not so to make the film a comedy in any way, but to add a bit of comic relief. <br /> <br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who would enjoy a nice family film, it's really worth getting, I can almost guarrantee you'll want to watch it again and again.
B00005B36H|2.0|This is Tool's latest album. It is perhaps one of the most unique albums ever made, but that does not make them so great. Tool is one of the worst Progressive Metal bands to walk on the face of the earth. Heck, they are not even Progressive Metal, more like Pseudo-Progressive Metal. The guitarwork in this album is terrible and the drumming is way too unpaced and random. Maynard's vocals are terrible and hardly shows much talent. My point is that Tool is one-terrible Metal version of Pink Floyd. Don't buy this album. Instead pick up one of these cds: Dream Theater- Scenes From A Memory Pain Of Salvation- Remedy Lane or The classic Pink Floyd- The Wall. Tool is a bad waste of time and definitely a waste of talent.
B0007P3582|4.0|So now, we have 50 Cent's second major label album, The Massacre. The second G-Unit release of the year, preceded by The Game's excellent The Documentary (review is forthcoming.) Get Rich or Die Tryin' was a solid pop-rap album riddled with bangin' beats, catchy hooks, and plenty of swagger to boot. The only issue is that 50 Cent was very weak as a lyricist which hurt the overall quality of the album. It's not that he was simple, he was just bad. It seems, though, that 50's lyrical deficiency is no longer of any consequence as both his lyricism and style have undergone a significant upgrade.  <br /> <br />This is The Massacre.  <br /> <br />Track Listing  <br />01.

B0002F1CO6|5.0|Buy this Double cd, you elitist Progressive Metal fans, this will awe you. If you like Metal, you might dig Part 2 because of the \\"heavier\\" music.
B000696PWC|4.0|not really much of a hype of a greatest hits package.  it basically covers all the grounds it can get on kylie's career. that much, and that much only.<br /><br />i can't think much of anything good, or bad about kylie, so i'm just gonna give this a four star review.
B00006L83N|5.0|Buy this cd if you love Dream Theater, or heavy prog-music in general, buy it if you like great guitar-driven rock/metal in general, like anything from Malmsteen, \\"Dimebag\\", Satriani, any great player. You probably wont be disappointed. If you only like \\"radio-metal\\" like Linkin Park, Staind, Puddle Of Mudd and the like, you probably wont like this. <br /> <br /> Michael Romeo's playing is sort of Malmsteen-meets-Dimebag Darrell, heavy odd metered riffs like Dimebag used to do, albiet more \\"Bach-n-rock\\" style, and solo's similar to Malmsteen, but not a copy, Romeo's are alot less pick-every-note, more fluid and legato. <br /> <br /> This cd The Odyssey starts off with a Malmsteen style opening riff to Inferno, and doesnt let up till the last note of Masquerade (redone from their first cd, Symphony X). Every song is solid, no cheesiness in the lyrics which most Fantasy-style metal bands cant pull off.  <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Symphony X but dont have any of their cd's this is the one to start with. It's their heaviest, and the keyboards/bass got pushed back in the mix a bit, but it's their best effort to date.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|It was about 8 months ago when I bought When The Pawn and I can honestly say I've listened to it at least 3 times a week since then and haven't tired of it yet. It combines the perfect elements of artsy and catchy- two characteristics that more artists should strive for. Her lyrics are raw, real, and rhythmically intertwined with her music which allures you into her crazy world. When the Pawn once again proves that Fiona is one of the greatest wordsmiths around.
0385510454|2.0|The Broker can hardly be called a first rate thriller (of any kind). Heck, for that matter, it isn't all that great a story either (too many lose ends, too many characters introduced for the sake of introduction but not given any kind of meaningful place in the story - case in point - the Chinese assasin).  <br /> <br />At the end of the day, the Broker reads better as a travelouge of Italy (even if Mr. Grisham did take some literary license on that point as well) than a thriller, which is a shame.
B000023VR6|5.0|If you are looking for a great album to party to or just listen to, this album fits the bill. The lyrics don't have the complexity that Jay-z and Nas have but they are still good. Basically this album is great to just lay back and vibe with.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie kicks Matrix' ass! And if you have read the Da Vinci Code or know anything about Mary Madgelene(spellcheck) you really are going to appreciate the hidden theme this movie portrays. If not this movie will still blow you away like no other has before, the gun scenes in this movie are of the best I have ever viewed, acting is supurb, and the message is mind-blowing. BUY THIS MOVIE... its very worth the money, and I rarely say that about anything but im saying it now... get this.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|Thought-provoking tale about the cataclysmic weather events that take place on planet earth as a result of global climate changes.  Dennis Quaid stars as a climatologist who knows his stuff...and based upon information received from his colleagues around the globe, determines that the massive storms and temperature changes that the world has been experiencing is ushering in another ice age.  Predictably, he battles with US politicians in an effort to save as many as his countrymen as possible--finally convincing the president to evacuate all southern US states to Mexico (talk about a twist of fate), explaining that all is lost for folks currently in the northern US states.  Unfortunately for Mr. Quaid, his son is among the \\"lost\\".....on a school trip with fellow brainiacs in New York City.    Storyline to make one sit back and take stock upon the many ways we abuse our beloved Earth.  Is the science plausible..?  Who knows?  Who cares?  The special effect are awesome, the scenes are riveting, and the carnage is visited upon those most deserving...sparing our \\"Third World\\" brethren.      This one is a keeper.        DYB
B00005UEAR|5.0|There are only 2 albums that I would give (and have given) to a person that wanted to listen to Dream Theater: Scenes From a Memory and Six Degrees.  Whereas SFAM is an excellent concept album, that combines excellent music with an artistic arrangement and production, 6 Degrees is a concept album with the hard-edged, speed demon musicianship that I have come to love from DT.   <br /> <br />Other reviewers will criticize this 2-disc album song-for-song, comparing them to previous DT songs as well as other progressive rock bands of yore.  DT is not YES, Rush, or Genesis.  They do their own thing and that is just who DT is...it's what is needed in music today. <br /> <br />Back to music...\\"The Glass Prison\\" is an epic song that really comes full circle.  (It starts with the same sound bite, record fuzz, as their previous concept album: SFAM.) Double bass drum, lightning-fast guitar riffs, and deep bass tones are what drives this song.  And since half the time you can't understand what LaBrie is singing because his notes are so high, we forget to just sit back and take his voice as another instrument in the band, adding overtones to the thumping and rumbling that make this song great.   <br /> <br />I was disappointed to hear people bashing \\"Misunderstood\\", since that is probably my favorite DT song of all times.  'From a God to God save me' is a powerful statement that rings true to many, but the best part of this song is how the band just explodes into the song after that line.  I love the chorus so much.  Of course the song is slow, but it's not always about playing fast, it's playing ballads in ways ballads aren't normally played. <br /> <br />I really like \\"The Great Debate\\" because it is political without taking sides.  I hate when bands try to force their views on me and this song allows me to come to my own conclusions.  It is necessary for this song to be included because it is experimental.  The background music while the news clips are playing is all you need.  If I had that playing during the news, I'd never stop watching TV. <br /> <br />The second disc is also very excellent.  \\"Overture\\" is a good song in that it is something that may be played between scenes in a musical/play, which is an interesting addition to music these days.  \\"War Inside My Head\\" and \\"Test That Stumped Them All\\" are beyond words.  The speed they play the songs would wake up the dead, and the lyrics are perfect and hit the album's concept on the nail.  \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" is a slow and lovely song, necessary to slow the pace of the previous, viciously-paced songs.  It's a song for the ladies I guess, in that it's not thrash metal, but it's good and strikes a chord on the heart.  \\"Solitary Shell\\" is probably my second favorite DT song, because of the bass drum, pumping the song through, but the lyrics really call to me as well, I think that's why I like it so much.  \\"Losing Time/Grand Finale\\" is a great song to end the album.  It's not super fast like other songs on the album, but it brings the entire album to a great ending.  The last few minutes of the song are great.  The album ends with a slow chord decrescendo, which, played backwards, is what begins their next full-length album, \\"Train of Thought\\".  Things like this are what makes me love Dream Theater.  Not only do they throw riffs in their songs from older great songs of theirs, but they have ways of welding together their albums in ways that can only be found from progressive rock's best band, Dream friggin' Theater!
0784011931|4.0|I recently watched this movie after not having seen it for a long, long time, and I have to admit that it is a very good movie, much better than most of the action genre.  Excellent special effects coupled with some amazing action sequences make for an exciting and gripping watch.  I particularly thought that the chase scene near the beginning was quite well done.  And I found Robert Patrick to be the perfect part as the T-1000 robot; his steely determined expression really was convincing.  In terms of this movie being a \\"classic\\" as some reviewers would have it--I wouldn't go so far.  The movie does have some inconsistancies and weak parts.  But overall, it is a very good and entertaining action movie.  It's kind of odd watching this movie with its post-apocalyptic element; the movie came out just at the end of the Cold War era when the possibility of an apocalyptic end to civilization was very real; that likelihood has, thankfully, become much less likely, and I think that makes the movie less unsettling and dark as when I first saw it.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|Although I have seen the \\"Celtic Woman\\" cd in the store, I did not listen to it thinking it another derivative celtic music collection.  However, I caught part of the PBS broadcast of this show and was totally mesmerized.  The new spin on such classics as Ave Maria and contemporary classics like Ennio Morricone's Nella Fantasia, Enya's Orinoco Flow and Josh Groban's You Raise Me Up brought me to norvana.  The soprano's(Chloe, Meav, Lisa Kelly) voices are crystal clear and Orla's harpistry is divine.  Mairead's fiddle playing brings this cd back to earth with its foot stomping earthy, cetic and vibrant flavor.  My only regret is that they did not include the stunningly beautiful Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring that was featured in the PBS special.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It's just incredible how these guys challenge themselves on every chord of what results a very complicated album. <br />It starts just like Metallica's Master of Puppets, with an acoustic guitar followed by chaos. <br />From there you just can't tell if you are still listening the same song or tracks are continuously skipping.  <br />Dance to the sound of Caribbean rhythms, scream to the powerful guitar solos and mesmerize to the progressive drum beat... It's just hard to explain what they try to do with the songs. <br />Ahora aadamos letras en espaol e ingles. No importa si solo hablas uno de los 2 idiomas o no entiendes ninguno. Las letras son tan elocuentes y complicadas que las palabras parecen carecer de sentido una vez que las unes en oraciones. <br />There's something I didn't like though. The constant waste of minutes spent on pure noise that for some reason the El Paso afro couple seems to enjoy so much...It's pretty annoying. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|i have seen the play 5 times in my life and loved them all. i even sing it. when i saw the movie i loved it though it could have been better. rossum and butler had pretty good voices, but i think they should have got michael crawford and sarah brightman to sing in their place and got Baz Luhrmann (the director of moulin rouge) to direct it. that would have won best pic for the oscars. but overall this movie was great.
B0002X314C|5.0|I agree with all of the other folks in regards to Mr. Legend (smile)... This cd is a HIT!!! John is smooth with his vocal and piano talents. He is a class act, he leaves you wanting more. I can't wait until his next cd. I liked the special touch of his family singing with him. Its sooooooooo hard to choose just one cause each song has a meaning and purpose - but for me with all of the special things that are happening in my life at the present moment, I have to say that its \\"SO HIGH\\"... That's my wedding song.... Made props to Kayne for giving another brother a chance to come on and make it happen... Forward Movement in 2005...
B0000640VO|2.0|A woman with the mind of a child. A film that is colorful and imaginative bogs itself down with a contrived romance that trips and falls into your typical hollywood shlock. The twist is that the only thing keeping these two lovers apart is Amelie herself. She is both protagonist and antagonist and this will frustrate you, dear viewer, to no end. If this film wasn't in French I wonder how many people will be hailing it as they do now. It has some cute inspired moments (such as the traveling Gnome) and her mission to help others started out intriguing enough but the film falls into false sentimentality and quickly we learn that Amelie isn't a character, she's a puppet with the mannerism of a barbie doll and the maturity of a 12 yr old girl. Where are the strong confident female characters? Is this the best the french have to offer? Is this just an American movie indisguise? Don't be fooled by the subtitles, just because it's in a foreign language doesn't make it any better than your typical hollywood romantic comedy. Amelie starts off promising but fails because instead of getting a strong female character we get a walking doll who gets in her own way just to stretch this film to it's two hour time mark.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Can't believe how ugly Madonna has become. Troll city. Her music is just as bad.  <br /> <br />Norah Jones is classy and madonna is too gross now to even qualify for trailer trash.
