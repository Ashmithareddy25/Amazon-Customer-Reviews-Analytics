B0049J3QF4|5.0|This is his favorite movie so of course it is played a couple times a day! One movie I don't think I get tired of!!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|There are really good actors, Oscar winners all, and then there is Daniel Day-Lewis.  His embodiment of Lincoln is uncanny; one feels as if it is really Abe himself.  There is a lot of talk in this movie, and it is all great talk.  It is instructive that Congress is just as fractious in this film as in the present, and shows how important it is to have a great leader to bring order out of chaos.
B005J2V74C|2.0|Starts ok with a &#34;we didn't change anything&#34; statement but no finish about what happened when the crew disappeared.  Very slow in parts.
030746363X|5.0|This book completely changed the way I look at my body and how to shape it. A must read for anyone looking to get in great shape.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|I'm hooked on this game. beautiful level design easy to use controls, difficult to master the levels and a lot of fun. one of the better games I have played on a mobile device. great job.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Classic comedy!  Very funny!  I cried from laughing at one point in the movie. Would definitely watch again and again!
B004UPANGM|4.0|I've seen this movie several times and it never fails to make me lol.  Old school effects but lots of them and Bruce Campbell rocks as always.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A fantastic story full of twists and turns. The characters are well developed and manage to draw you in quite easily. You will not regret buying this book. I hope the author keeps the story going!
B0087EACJK|3.0|I like the concept and the level designs. the only flaw is the controls they are slow, awkward and clumsy. I would like to possible have the controls more in line with a console game dpad for direction and a jump button. the double tap would be better if it was a button on the top of the screen somewhere. and a timer a timed game need to have a timer.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Major pop ups keep coming up, so incredibly obnoxious. They definitely need to fix that. If that didn't happen, it would be 5 stars.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Reliving my past! I love this. What an interesting life he has lead. Written very well, easy and enjoyable read!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|My husband loves his stylus, as he has big fingers and it makes it easier to read on his Kindle or play games.
B000FA675C|2.0|then this book is for you! I did not like it at all. I am sure there are lots of people who will like this style of writing.... I don't!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a great story.  I couldn't put it down.  I saw the movie,but the book was much more detailed.  I highly recommend it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read. Good insight into the characters that is different from the movie but the same in ways as well.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Bought this case to protect my Kindle Fire HD. It stays in this case while I'm using it. I love it!
B00338QENI|4.0|I liked the way the author intertwined the scientific and personal information. it was just enough to keep my interest throughout the book. I enjoyed it very much.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I was hoping the book would be insightful, but was disappointed to find she is self absorbed.  I'm an avid reader but this book jumps around so much it's hard to follow. And frankly very boring.  My book club read it.  Out of nineteen of us not one of us liked it!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a great who done-it.  I dont want to say too much to give it away, but it is well written and a great read.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|good story a little predictable but great creation of the micro world.  He knows how to create  &#34; a place&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|In my opinion, Vince Flynn is the very best! His books hold your interest from page one to the very last page. i never want his books to end!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie flat out aggravated me. I like thrillers that are tough to understand but this movie had so many confusing plots to follow that I tuned out about 3/4 of the way through. I'm a pretty intelligent woman and I shouldn't have to work this hard when I'm watching a movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book.  It takes you into a world of magic, the likes of which you have never imagines and sets up a competition between two magicians that takes them to the brink.  I loved the imagery and the story.  Very well written.
B000UFAURI|5.0|well they've done it again, them foo fighters, so  far have not let me down. its great to be able to get caught up on some material from these guys via Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Season three lost me as a viewer. It just isn't what it used to be. Not enough exploration of zombie apocalypse problems.
030746363X|4.0|This isnt a fad diet, this is a scientific diet based on facts, trial and error, and expirements. The entire book may or may not be for you but Tim Ferris points that out from the beginning. As far as the diet portion goes, ive lost over 20 lbs in a month and felt great. You dont have to follow what he says in detail but everything ive tried so far with or without adjustments have worked. I could say a lot but just go and read it and try it for yourself, its the only way.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The book was a little slow at times, but overall I enjoyed it very much.  It is a true story of this woman's solo journey hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  She tells great stories about her struggles and the characters she meets along the way.  Her perseverance is amazing.
B000002LRX|5.0|i havent listened to this gem in quite a long time, last time was probly on cassette tape. this band had a truely special chemistry and brotherhood to come up with this masterpiece!
B009IJJ5B4|1.0|As a lifelong Holmes fan, the low quality of writing in this show is extraordinarily off-putting. I mean, Holmes's big insult to the inspector is to call him by the English translation of a French name?? Come on. It tries so hard to be clever... and fails miserably. Watch the BBC's Sherlock, the RDJ Sherlock movies, or just read the books instead.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked the story for the first half a lot.  I really didn't like the end  and I kept waiting to like the characters, which  never really happened for me.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|A wonderful story about the young boy Siddhartha and his spiritual journey to become the Buddha.  A classic and very meaningful.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I can't say anything that hasn't already been said about this book. Joseph Heller is clever, witty, and hilarious. This is easily the greatest piece of fiction I have ever read!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|what started to be  a nice trilogy on this book  the characters lost their appeal for me, haven't even finish the book, I can accept that is not the best writing  but  you star losing interest and getting frustrating with the principal characters, Christian once  with this great personality  begin to look  so  needing and week  and  Ana so immature  and insecure, i know she is 21 but come on , no sexy no sexy at all
0316228532|3.0|First: I am a Harry Potter fan and read this knowing it was completely unrelated to JKR's other stories in both style and content. Now that that's out of the way...<br /><br />The writing is competent, in that my expectations were met. The story itself, however, was dreadful. Without giving away more than what one can read on the jacket, pretty much everyone in Pagford dispises their parents, children, spouses, teachers, students, coworkers and classmates. No one in the story is truly happy and there is no character to root for. I kept waiting for the story to pick up or make a turn where it would become an interesting read. Unfortunately, I felt myself for the most part slogging through the book. Although there were some clever bits, overall it was simply disappointing to find the storyline limited to how the facade of the quaint village hides the unhappy lives of everyone who lives there. Some may enjoy this kind of story, but I found it simply depressing and monotone. 2.5 stars.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An amazing account of a near death experience by a neurosurgeon.  Highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in what happens to us after our soul leaves our earthly body.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|This cd is great amazing music whit good lyrics.Chuck Billy shows his powerful voice in this album,and Alex plays the guitar like only he kwons,the drums sounds amazing almost \\"The Gathering\\".The first thing i noticed is the sound quality,you can hear and difference all the instruments(first and second guitar,drumbs,bass) much better all the previous discs of the band.I buy the special deluxe edition whit 2 discs:<br /><br />Disc one:thirteen song including a extended version of \\"Throne Of Thrones\\" and three covers:Powerslave(maidens classic)Dragon attack(Queen)and Animal magnetism(Scorpions)<br /><br />Disc two:documentary of the making of album whit interviews whit the guys,four live songs whit the band playing in concert,and a gear tour whit Alex and Eric showing your guitars.
B000E2635A|5.0|Great to relive this game from my childhood, so glad I found this to show my boys Brian Bozworth, Keith Jackson, Lydell Carr, and Jamelle Holieway.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It is addictive.  It works well on my kindle HD. Only con: Wish it had levels or a way to clear the stats.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have come to love Gillian Flynn and this was the first book I read of hers.  I have now read all three and can't wait for the next ones.  Her characters are manipulative and a little bit evil and continue to surprise you at every turn.  And there are many twists and turns.  I love her style of telling the story through the voices of the different characters.  I literally could not put this book down.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I loved this movie. It contained everything that makes for movie magic. It's funny, touching, adventurous, suspenseful at times i its own way, authentic and more. The acting was terrific, and I was left with a happy heart. Watch this movie and increase your well-being.
B008602KQI|5.0|Interesting idea for a movie storyline.  Jennifer Lawrence delivers a wonderful performance.  Love to watch this movie over and over again!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Everything was perfect and in good shape, the cover didn not present any damage, the season is complete and runs great
B007JM4CWY|5.0|It is completely addictive! A lot of levels and funny figures. Hours of fun with this logic and mathematical game.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Started off very similar to hopeless but than the twists and drama come into play. Great Book and I loved there was a sequel so I could keep on reading!
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|Was always like most of Kelly songs but never had any of her CDs - this has all her Greatest Hits - its an awesome CD
B00004RF98|4.0|The disc and cover are in a little worse condition then I expected, but this is a classic which I wanted to own
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great episode I love the whole seires and season three is the best so far!!  I Can't wait for season four to start in October!!!
0385535139|4.0|We own/have read all of John Grisham's books, other than the &#34;Theodore Boone&#34; series, and this has been a tough read for me.  I'm only on page 137 though, so hopefully that will change...
B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter loved The Little Mermaid and I bought it for my granddaughter - I consider it a classic must have disney movie.
B00001QEE9|1.0|So I ordered this movie for my son and though everything was great, the movie showed up at my door in two days and I put it in the player for my son to watch only to find out it was prince of Egypt.... The box has Pinocchio on the cover, the disk has Pinocchio on the cover but its really prince of Egypt........
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|\\"Rashomon\\" tells the story of a rape and a murder through the eyes of each of the participants--a samurai (whose ghost testifies), his wife, and a bandit (played by a young Toshiro Mifune) as reported by several people talking about the trial of the bandit and the versions of \\"reality\\" that they have heard. Should not be missed by anyone who loves the director, Akira Kurosawa, who also made \\"The Seven Samurai\\" (later adapted into \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" w. Yul Brynner), \\"Yojimbo\\" (transformed into \\"A Fistfull of Dollars\\" starring Clint Eastwood), its sequel  (\\"Sanjuro\\"), and versions of \\"Macbeth\\" (\\"Throne of Blood\\"), \\"King Lear\\" (\\"Ran\\"), and \\"Hamlet\\" (\\"The Bad Sleep Well\\"), among many other superb movies. \\"Rashomon\\" was one of the first to win him a worldwide audience and deserves its distinguished place in cinema history.
0307887448|5.0|This was a great read!  I really don't know what else to say.  If you love video games and learning some pretty obscure things from 80s pop culture you will love this book.  The world both real and virtual feels so real and engaging.  The characters are also great.  I'm sorry I can't really tell give a better review I just think you should pick it up, because you won't put it down until the very last satisfying page.<br /><br />5 out of 5!
B0056E3S4U|5.0|An American Idol...love all his songs that David Cook has ever done - wish he would do more - love it.
0345505387|2.0|The service was great. It's the book its self I was disappointed in. If you haven't read the &#34;Outlander&#34; book, you won't have a clue as to what this book is about. And the illustration are awful!!! So child like. Its like looking at a bad comic book. the only good thing is, it was cheap!!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I enjoy historical based movies and was very excited to see Lincoln. However, the movie moved so slow that it became almost painful to sit through. With that said, Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field did an amazing job portraying the Lincolns. So if slow is your pace I highly recommend you see this Oscar winning film otherwise YAWN!!!
0062124293|4.0|I would never, in a million years, called myself a feminist - until I read this book.  She melds humor with some important questions that, not just women, but society should question.  A very interesting viewpoint and a refreshing point of view.<br /><br />For all of those out there who think that feminism equates to bra burning, this book will have you re-evaluating that idea.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses and I thought I would really enjoy this - but my kindle keep freezing everytime I tried to open this and not to mention that it is somewhat similiar to Farmville in the fact that you need to spend money to really enjoy the extras - disappointed in that - I deleted it.
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is not the original Alicia Keys &#34;Girls On Fire&#34; but more of a remix of it; great music! I got this item fast, undamaged, and I am very happy to play it over and over again!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|We were rushed to see the movie because we viewed if off the computer and had very little time to sit and enjoy uninterrupted time savoring and understanding the core messages.  However, this was a most powerful film and well done and acted...it will be a classic for the centuries.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinerest especially on my kindle fire!  But lately it has been constantly becoming unresponsive!!  Please fix this soon!!
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I really dislike sleazy, and crude, for no reason shows.  We didn't even watch all the first episode. Just too gritty for me.
B00760BPOC|4.0|I bought this book to find ot &#34;what happens next&#34;. It got a little dreary in the chapters with Dany - a halt to her progress. Tyrion is his usually witty self, but his journey is rather linear. We learn what happened to Theon - ghastly!<br />And Jon is managing business on the wall quite well. Other bits are fleeting and untantalising... but I still liked it.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a cute app. I just don't care to announce games on Facebook so I will play by myself.  Also,  I have made the mistake of paying for tapfish so I won't squander &quot;gems &quot; to hurry things along.
B007JNR518|4.0|I do like Redford movies, especially his work which touches the viewer in a more personal vein.<br />One of the stars of this movie has to be *Pilgrim*, after all it is about him, and the emotional stress he has to overcome to re-associate himself with Grace.<br />I could go on but in a short review...just view the movie.<br /><br />On another note:<br />What has the studio done to the video of this movie? The first 33mins of the movie display a less than 1920 width image, the height is unaffected, it's not until one comes to that point in the movie that the image goes to *full width*. I thought this was just something in a error with the SD version I have of this movie, but it would not seem to be so.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I love that I can manage my facebook company page from my cell phone! It really helps me stay on top of it and makes toggling between my personal and company page much simpler.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Another well written book. All of  them in this series are. It will keep you intrigued till the end. If you like the show, the books are even better.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Baseball movies are often trite, but with Eastwood starring and directing this one is a keeper.  Good story line and the puffed ego gets his just deserts in the end.  Gratifying.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have enjoyed this series very much.  Can hardly wait for Season 4.  I think I like it even more than UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, and I thoroughly enjoyed that series and watch it over and over again.
B001XUT6AG|4.0|We watched this movie on our Roku using our Amazon prime membership and instant streaming. Quality was good and it streamed seamlessly. We watch instant streaming movies several times a week and are always happy with the viewing experience.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Un be known to me the color note has an auto backup function that every time I launch the note, it automatically back up my notes. My smartphone crashed and rebooted. When I reinstall the app, all my important notes were restored from google
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the funniest game I love it it gets so addicting it is really awesome I play this game all night and whenever I have a chance too play it I love this game I think you should play it that is my opinion trust me I is fun who ever has not played it
0670026603|5.0|The plot had me from page 1. The writing had me from the first sentence. I would highly recommend this book!
0345803507|5.0|I really enjoyed the Fifty Shades trilogy. They are well written and a nice distraction from real life. Beware, these books are very racy and not for juvenile or adolescent readers. With two teenage boys at home, I've hidden my copies under my bed. For adults, they are raunchy and fun.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|this long forgotten Roy Orbison show full of rock elite both on stage and in the crowd is a must see by Rock fans.  Roy had the most complex voice a sound that will never be duplicated. His voice would raise emotion in people evoking some to tears.
B0027MJU00|4.0|It was a fairly good read but violence and dark for sure.  Not a typical book I normally would read.
B001QFZADA|5.0|I absolutely love the book! It's helped understand a lot more about relationships! I can't wait to read more of his books or even go to a conference of his..
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed the Fifty Shades trilogy. They are well written and a nice distraction from real life. Beware, these books are very racy and not for juvenile or adolescent readers. With two teenage boys at home, I've hidden my copies under my bed. For adults, they are raunchy and fun. My husband refused to read them but he was all too happy to listen to the daily recap of what I had read the night before. Blushing is guaranteed.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as realistic as other novels by Grisham, but worth the read if you are a fan of his. My favorite book of his is still The Firm
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show starts off strong and keeps on getting better and better . Adult content for sure . I really enjoy this program .
B005DNBDXM|5.0|this film is a little old now, but it holds up quite well, and i really enjoy watching it. it has some good characters, especially the president, and flows quite well.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|This book was very well written. Some of the subject matter was quite dark. It has lots of twists and keeps the reader on their toes.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|No problems with the updates and I have the free version.  The ads wont load if you have the wifi turned off.  Love Angry Birds!
B002ZG997C|5.0|I love this movie I loved it in the theatres with surround sound on you think you in the movie Denzel be doing his thang in movies gotta be my favorite actor right with will smith
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I loved the Lord of the Rings movies and this follows in the same great entertainment line. The 3D makes the visuals even better.
030746363X|5.0|Have had the honor to read, review, and read again the great Choose-Your-Own-Adventure guide with test proven strategies. I also refer to it, when i have questions or concerns about anything health and fitness related. Tim Ferriss has been my guide for so many areas of lifestyle designing and making my daily activities more efficient and effective. For that I thank you dearly. Grateful for the knowledge he brings and for the people he has met whom also have influenced my human potential. The 4 Hour Body is a book that not only encompasses the tools to great physical feats with the human body, but simply how to be a great person.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I discovered The Walking Dead after Season 3 started. I never thought it would be my kind of show. I hate horror films, and I couldn't understand what was so compelling about a bunch of walking zombies. Well, I was wrong. The show is incredible. I ordered all 3 seasons and am now sad that I have to wait for Season 4. I watched all of these episodes while working out, and it kept me going! I would highly recommend this series. BTW, I am a fan of Downton Abbey, anything Jane Austen, The Good Wife, Homeland, and Game of Thrones. Walking Dead is about characters, lives, hope, faith, survival, persistence. And the situation is actually very realistic in this age of terrorism/bio terrorism. If you like excellent drama and acting, you'll love this.
B000DZIGE4|5.0|I love this movie I used to watch it all the time on my DVR now i have on dvd to watch anywhere when im away from home on my laptop prompt delivery very satisfied
B005R32L66|5.0|It works, you call people, put money on your account, turn on the cam and chat away...what else needs to be said?
B0034G4P80|5.0|We enjoyed this at the theaters and wanted to have it for our own entertainment library.  Just the right mix of humor and not overly heavy in the story line.  Our younger grandkids can follow the story line surpisingly well.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The most delightful series I recently discovered, so I wanted to view it from the beginning.  It is clever, compassionate, intelligent, well acted, moral, and pure.  Bravo BBC.
B004NELBPC|1.0|The App is glichey, and not very appealing to the eyes. Plus all the opinion articles, whish is all of them, are pure twaddle.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game for when you need to waste some time. Really good for when #2 comes calling and you need to be kept busy HAHA!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have two of these, one in clear and one smoke, for two different phones. I think the case and screen protector combo is a great value and they both have earned their keep. The case is a bit slick, but that hasn't been an issue for me. My only qualm with the clear case is that over time it has started getting a very slight yellowish tinge to it. I tried cleaning it but haven't had any luck. Still, I'm happy with the case and thankful for the many times it has protected my phone.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Upon hearing Mirrors my girlfriend and I were hooked. It isn't the greatest album but its full of hooks and Justin's signature layered vocals. The weirdest songs I find myself a lot more like Strawberry Bubblegum and Spaceship Coupe. I knew it would do well when my dad got the album and told me, \\"You hear the new JT album? Can't stop listening to it! Bought it the day it came out.\\"
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|I've always admired Clarke's writing style but 'Childhood's End' lost my attention in the last chapters. He's usually very discriptive but the story went willy nilly at the end.
0847830942|1.0|all items delivered with this order had issues, there were books in the order, dustcover was ripped and all plastic wraps protecting the books were ripped / opened.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|BlueRay quality is superb -  it brings new life to the first two movies with clarity and color that is even better than the original theater releases.  The bonus features are a must for true Alien fans to see how the creatures are made throughout the films.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book exciting different not what i thought but enjoyable. have already bought the next book in the serious so it  makes you want to keep reading
B003U51D58|5.0|Regardless of how one might feel about how it ended, on the whole this was extremely well-written. While there were a few questions left unanswered most were resolved.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Perhaps I'm a bit biased, since I am a huge Muse fan, but this band just gets better with each release. The Resistance was a wonderful album, and I remember asking myself, &#34;how in the world are they going to improve upon this?&#34; Wow, they did not disappoint with this album. From the deep, and through-provoking lyrics to the intelligent melodies, they pulled out all the stops with The 2nd Law.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|One heart pounding, blood pressure raising thrill ride....one of the best revenge movies ever done I am sure...Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx are amazing!!
B000I62JAK|4.0|Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell are the most hilarious men ever.  Will Ferrell as Mugatu, one word... wow! Good movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|So far up to episode 20 and have found season 8 to be excellent. Consistently funny and awesome. Yep, it's - wait for it - legendary!!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I found this band by happy accident while clicking through Amazon's music site one afternoon. I meant to click on an entirely different link, and gave the little 30 second samples a listen. I immediately clicked &#34;buy&#34; within a few minutes of listening. Yes, this album is THAT good. Well played, and well recorded album from a relatively new band.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Heart wrenching and so scary,,,,hard to believe this family made it back together.. well done and believable....watch it if you can
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|If you like something that is out of the ordinary and performed superbly, than this is well worth the watch. It is a love story done in a non-traditional way and you have to admire the work these performers put into their craft to appreciate the movie. The ending is what I liked best and even brought a tear to my eye.
B001AXU1CS|5.0|Its a great movie and I just love the leather jacket that came with it-plus it came really fast, so that's a bonus :-) All around a great product, and I'd recommend it for anybody who loves Grease
B009KWU6Q2|1.0|Come on, grow up producers and directors...allow a children's epic to be what it is without trying to vulgarize it into adulthood.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Very funny... great voice overs... animation was top notch and it never seemed to lose steam throughout the entire movie. I wish &#34;actor-based&#34; movies were this good!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The second of this trilogy deals with the events before and during WWII. Follett has done extensive research and een though this is a fictional book, the background info is very accurate. Highly recommend!!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|Worth every penny  If looking for a turntable this is the one  Excellent tone and sound for all speakers  Great to record from as well  Software easy to laod
B002BWP49C|5.0|this show was the grossest show at times witch i dont really get into thingsd like this but this wasnt that bad m
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|There is a pattern to any change.  This book explains this pattern with realistic examples and easy to implement recommendations.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|When this movie was in theaters it was a very big deal, especially for the likes of us that were looking for another &#34;Matrix&#34; like experience.  I truly remember enjoying it and being highly entertained but I knew I needed to see it again to catch the details that I truly missed with this fast paced, detail-packed movie.<br />After having watched it again via streaming I remember why I liked the movie but now I find that now that I got to take in more of the details that it left me wishing there were more to it than what it actually was.  Utilizing the world of subconscious dreams was a fascinating vehicle to tell a simple story of redemption basically, and the details actually were more about driving the story in the dream vehicle they created in this Inception Dream World more so than I could actually relate to with my own dreaming experiences.  A little touch of the bewildering experiences that happen only in dreams like old friends you barely remember showing up randomly, spontaneous flying, not being able to run when you are trying your best, suddenly being naked in a crowd, etc., would have truly connected me more with the Dream Vehicle.<br /><br />Leo was solid, no complaints there.  Everyone played their roles well with a fairly limited script involving true human interaction.  The goal of the script here was to Drive This Plot Vehicle Home!  I would recommend it alone for it's mind opening concepts, but a classic like the &#34;Matrix&#34; series it is not.
015206396X|5.0|This is an intense and amazingly well told story. It was delivered to me incredibly quickly and was in great condition. I was very happy with this book.
B00361R2VU|4.0|I didn't care for the way it was filmed by using the perspective of home footage but maybe this added to the suspense. Anyways this film was very scary and actually creepy at a few points. I've enjoyed this series so far and look forward to more films coming out.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I have been a long time Paramore fan... I'm talking back when \\"Pressure\\" premiered on FUSE. Thus, I feel like I can honestly give advice on this album in comparison to their previous ones... And this is definitely not the same ole Paramore. However, they have been changing for quite some time... Their first album was gritty rock. Their second was gritty pop. Their third sort of went back to the feel of their first album, but was definitely more mainstream. This album is the biggest departure in style between albums for them, but, like I said, they have been evolving for a while.<br /><br />Even though this isn't what you'd expect from Paramore, I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />This album is full of sounds I have never heard before, and, although the styles vary on this album, everything ends up being cohesive. (They really took a risk doing all of these styles because it very easily could have been a big, fat mess.)<br /><br />I do have to say though, Hayley doesn't have as many WOW moments on this album, but you can hear the versatility in her voice- something we haven't heard much of before. Even though I would have liked to hear her really push her voice in this way, she definitely DOES push it by changing up her tone and delivery.<br /><br />To make a long review short, I honestly like every song- something that is VERY rare for me. I even like the interludes, which I admit, I was skeptical about at first...as interludes are usually a waste of space. These interludes; however, are there for a purpose, and they bring out a different side to her voice.<br /><br />The standout tracks on this album for me are: Fast in my Car, Daydreaming, Ain't it Fun, Part II, Last Hope, Hate to See Your Heart Break, Proof, and Be Alone (sounds like \\"old school\\" Paramore.)<br /><br />Best album of the year for me.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My kids and I enjoyed Wreck it Ralph, I especially like seeing all the characters from the video game I grew up with. Another hit from Disney. With a good message about not accepting the labels people put on us.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved it!!! :)  I think the only problem I had  was dealing with the directer not your product. The Caracters were of and the movie didn't always follow the books but like I said, that is the directers fault.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Many apps download videos that you can't normally download, but this is one of the few that let you download from YouTube. No wonder it's not on the google play store anymore. Lol. Highly recommended for people who have a hard time with buffering videos.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Interesting contrast between the classes and the way the lines sometimes blur.  The characters are very believable with great acting.
0553381407|5.0|A very powerful and hard-hitting book. case studies will touch you and the practical chapters give you real ways to change.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am able to charge my fire quickly (less than 2 hours usually).  I use it in combination with a wall charging unit.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series makes you start to think \\"what if some type of virus really could come into our world\\". And it puts our lives into perspective. It shows us human reactions to such equations. I can hardly wait for season 4.!
B00BHMF578|3.0|The movie was well done but because it had won for best picture, I was expecting more.  Nothing was said about the captives until the very end.  The focus was solely on the rescue of the few who managed to sneak out of the US Embassy and live comfortably at the Canadian Embassy. The end of the rescue did have an &#34;edge of your seat&#34; quality to it.  I would have expected more of that.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Mindless at first but It really makes you use your brain as it gets harder. The colors keeps it interesting.
B00280LYHS|5.0|OMG  I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!! This and Harry Potter are awesome and I can't wait to start The Last Hero!!!!!!!! I loved the underwater kiss partXD
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|This Is 40 is a tough yet refreshing statement on married life, with children. It was both hilarious and frustrating, and that was what I liked best about it. It felt like real life. Even though my personal situation is far from theirs, I could relate to the characters and what they were going through.<br /><br />Pete & Debbie are at a crux in their relationship, only they don't know it yet. This Is 40 shows them navigating work, children, in-laws and love with a caring touch. It depicts two people who are in love, who are actually friends and how they will fight to keep what they have.<br /><br />If you are an Apatow fan, this is one for you. Even if you aren't a fan of Mr. Apatow's work, you could relate to the situations and struggles Pete & Debbie are going through. Paul Rudd is great, as usual. Albert Brooks is hilarious; genuinely frustrating and lovable. Leslie Mann is fantastic. This was a stand-out role for her and she knocked it out of the park; really funny, and very smartly played. The Apatow kids are great, as well.<br /><br />Lots of laughs through out the film. I was disappointed when it ended and I had to leave these characters.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This app is just like the real Star Wars movies.  It's totally worth the two dollars and ninety-nine cents!  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Mr. Grisham always gives a good story for readers.<br />My family does not like for me to get a new Grisham book---I don't put it down until I am through reading.<br />Thank you, John Grisham.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I have heard several interviews with Judd Apatow where he talks about this movie and what it meant to him.  I like where he's coming from, but I think he takes too long to tell the story.  (I have that complaint with most of his movies)  The acting is good (casting his own daughters, Maude and Iris, paid off) but overall, it's just okay.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Not long but it didnt need to be for emotional connection to the two children who watch their parents vanish! KING leaves you pondering outcomes n scenarios like a great story teller is supposed to do...
B003K07DUC|4.0|Great movie no quesrion about it. Damon turns in another realistic performance that Is griping and fast pace. I just felt that it needed a better ending. Uless they would make make a green zone 2, then I would give this one five stars .
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I loved Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy and had high hopes for this second installment.  The Hobbit was just one giant catastrophe after another and felt way too over the top.  Of course the special effects are beyond impressive and the acting is good, but it simply felt like too much.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I put off watching this but lately have seeing so much buzz about how good it is that I gave it a try (not to mention it features John Barrowman from Torchwood).  I was very pleasantly surprised and am thoroughly enjoying the story lines, twists and turns and of course the hero isn't too hard to look at.  Anxious to catch up on all I've missed.. and hope it stays as well written and executed as it has so far...
0743277708|5.0|good book, it is interesting and the words are clear to read, though someone have drew some lines before bt it's OK
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a  great show! Keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Crazy cliffhanger  ending! Can't wait for next season!
B000UZNRS2|4.0|If you have read James Patterson or James Rollins, you will love David Baldacci.  I just discovered his books.  I am in the process of reading them all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is very fun for everyone of all ages. The sounds are great and the graphics are pretty good, too. My horse teaches you how to take care of horses, and gives you a chance to be with a horse or horses.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I love to read about the Camel Club.  The book is fast pace and enjoyable and exciting to read.  If you like &#34;who did it&#34; books, you will love this book.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I recently came to hear him on TV and had to have any and all music from him. This is a great cd.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|Didnt't even use or keep it. I deleted it. I guess it wasn't what I was looking for. Might be good for someone else.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|This is a great cd for relaxing at home or in the car.  I recommend it.  I look forward to hearing more from him.
0345803507|5.0|I ordered the entire trilogy. I am not a big reader but heard so many good things about these books. I read all three books in a matter of a few days. I just couldn't put them down!
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|This is a wonderful cd; his voice is so beautiful. Nice to relax to when coming home from work or in the car.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg is one of the best women who could have written such book! Amazing amount of scientific data shared with her own personal experience.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I just heard about John Bonamassa from watching a special on PBS and I was hooked. Great CD. Buy it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I finish Fify Shades of Grey on 11 March 2013. I love it. It blow my mind.&lt;br/>I finsh Fify Shader of Darker on 12 March 2013. I love it. Why did she call if &#34;Daker' I thought it should be &#34;Fify Shader of loVE&#34;&lt;br/>Fify Shader of Freedom was a great end to the Mr. And Mrs Gray love story. Love it. She show his family she was ready in love with Gray.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|If you like McConaghey, he's done it again.  Lots of intrigue and keeps your interest to see if the bad guy gets what he deserves.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you'd like to dive into an adventure of quality sci-fi along with solid acting, you should definitely give this show a chance. I'm headed towards the end of 4th season now and I can't wait to figure out how the series finale would turn out. I really wish that the show was going on.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book started off a little slow, but as the story evolved, you were drawn into the suspense.  A very good book.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|hooray! Good flick and Daniel Day Lewis is the bomb. Sally Fields is old. Punky mix from Batman is in there too. 20 words y'all.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Great quality and a great show. Very nostalgic. Its too bad there were only three seasons of the original series
B009IUH1N2|5.0|I like the never ending running games mostly but after you play a bunch they start feeling like they're all the same but this one made the controls a little different so that it's not a game where you're just tapping your finger on the screen making the guy jump. He dashes over holes or cliffs by swiping your finger straight across &amp; he jumps by swiping your finger up while he's constantly running.  I haven't had any problems with the game it runs smooth on my galaxy 7+ tablet &amp; the controls seem to be right on. There's quick tutorial that will show you the controls.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|On its own, I find this game good. But, when my 6 year old son and I play it together, taking turns picking patterns, it is a positive joy. He loves it, and has fanciful name for all the patterns and calls them out as he reaches to &#34;explode&#34; them.<br /><br />Highly recommended time passer.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Something Borrowed was a typical chick flick, fun, not too serious.  Fun for a book/movie comparison.  I'd say the makers stuck pretty close to the book's content.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|When I first got my Galaxy Note 2 and downloaded this app I just went crazy, reading and reading, dozens of books, quickly. However, of late, I have drifted back to the library.<br /><br />I just like the feel of a real book.<br /><br />Otherwise, highly recommended.
B000FBFML6|5.0|This was one of the best series or books I've read in a long time.  I was sad when I finished.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|The movie is ok, not great not bad. Totally worth the rental.<br /><br />I need 8 more words here and now.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This was the only book I have read that had that much detail though I totally recommend it :) ! Totally worth 8 bucks
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A really engaging book. I really got invested in each of the characters. It's definitely has its sad moments but it is also filled with wonderfully quirky humor. Great book over all!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have installed this program on three previous tablets and it has worked great on each. Love the most recent update.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My all time favorite Broadway musical available to watch any time I want.  The singing and acting was phenomenal .  Love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this was the best book ever because the action<br />And the bravery and the bombing and just basically the action.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Very enjoyable Batman movie, does a good job of &#34;closing&#34; Batman series, although I am sure there are more to come
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great read.  Seriously funny at times.  Irreverent.  Science is good.  Cross between &#34;Robinson Crusoe&#34; and &#34;McGiver.&#34;  Tinkering to the Nth degree.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I loved the entire Delirium series so I was very excited for the last book. It was interesting because the book kept going back and forth between Lena and Hana. I liked being able to see both sides of the \\"war.\\"  It was fast paced and everything I expected, except for the ending.<br /><br />The ending is very open and I did not like that. Nothing was really solved and we don't know for sure what's going to happen with Lena or Hana. I would've liked a more concrete ending.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|A thrilling account of a return castaway who struggles to find his way back into the world he once knew.  Destine to right the wrongs of his father, Oliver Queen cheats death and rises up to take vengance on those who prey off innocence and seduce corruption.  I like the theme and storyline along with the action and passion of this series.
0783225547|3.0|I was a bit disappointed because I'd seen it years ago and remember it being a bit more graphic, so it seemed that although it is labeled &#34;collector's edition&#34; some parts seem to be missing and/or edited.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I liked the beautiful pictures, the nail biting suspense and a story of determination.  It is not a movie for small children due to the fact the tiger eats 3 other animals while at sea.
B005K17RU0|5.0|weatherchannel kept changing and got slow to load.<br />weatherunderground was slow<br />weatherbug kept crashing my Samsung Galaxy player<br />This is nice. I only wish it was a little easier to see wind direction. I use this for bicycle commuting.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|I  loved Season 1 but have only been able to chess a preview of Season 2 of Downton Abbey. I am most disappointed. If possible I would love o see the whole second Season
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a different kind of game and I enjoy playing it.  It makes you use your mind and is good eye coordination.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Continuing the story that began in<br />Season One, Season Two draws us deeper into the war and its aftermath. We learn more about the characters at Downton, and the deeper aspects of their lives and dreams. Truly a masterpiece.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game ever<br />It's so fun I can play for hours and the setting changes based on how high your score is. It's entertaining to login to Facebook and play against your friends
B005HSL626|4.0|Love the game... fast pace keeps me on my toes. Juicy looking fruit to have a fun mess and not have to clean up after yourself.
B009ZQ7M1U|5.0|Everybody should see this movie...It's incredibly moving. I got so emotionally involved and in the thick of it, really quick.  It just grabbed me INTO the story. Gotta see it!  Your sure to be moved.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you can follow 7 stories simultaneously, with lots of gut wrenching action and intrigue, then this show is for you...but do they have an ending in mind?
B00B23O96A|5.0|By George He has done it again. Eric has shared his heart in such a mature method and melody. He communicates with you deeply and in an enjoyable ride. This is best work since his unplugged album.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|This is a fun and feel good movie that makes you smile every time you watch it! Cars is not just for kids. Definitely for the whole family.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game was great,  played it all the time.  Now I am playing and trying to shorten my time. I just wish there we more games
034544678X|5.0|A really good guide to your dog's behaviour and, perhaps more importantly, to our own behaviour. Very interesting to find out that we are constantly communicating things to our dogs though our own actions, even minute ones we aren't aware of.  The information on Calming Signals is really interesting, and to read more about that check out On Talking Terms With Dogs: Calming Signals by Turid Rugaas
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book kept me guessing nearly all the way through, but mostly kept me engaged trying to understand Harold, Maureen, and what the heck had happened to their son, David. I just finished the book. It was definitely thought provoking and I will continue to ponder how his pilgrimage brought redemption in the end.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is awesome just buy it you can change the eye color,add clip art and much more! plus you can see other people pictures of what they make! &lt;3
B005LAIHR2|1.0|This movie is so incredibly cheesy, badly written and terribly performed by major A list actors. I can't believe this script lured people like Tom Cruise. I know Tom has made a dud here and there but this is just plain bad. He actually is the only thing I liked about the movie but what really ticked me off is a song performed in the beginning. Extreme's \\"More Than Words\\".... I LOVE THAT song but its not from the 80s! That song was number one hit in 1991. Thats such a big oversight and shows what carelessness was put into making this film. The director didn't seem to know whether he wanted to make a comedic parody or drama. I was really looking forward to seeing this because I love the hard rock music of the 80s but this was no tribute. I urge 80s rock fans to stay away from this film.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I enjoyed this and there was some pretty good dialog.  Styled as a western, the vocabulary includes &#34;ain't&#34; and the like which, it's apparent, the actors don't say in their private lives.  Other than the forced western-ese it's a good show. I wish there were more of them.
B000HSKUBE|1.0|We had already seen the American version so that probably colored our viewpoint.  We only watched the very beginning and then shut it off.  Perhaps if we had given it a chance, we would have found it much more interesting.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I got this for my Nexus 4 and its pretty nice. :) The only catch is that you might need to take your case off. I know it has a hard time working with the Diztronic TPU case. Other than that, its perfectly fine.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are never disappointed with any of the episodes of Downton Abbey - we are hooked and have lost sleep over this one.  It is addictive.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a great tool for someone on the go who would like to seek out the best WiFi signal to use one's tablet or other portable devices.  It allows the user to know if he or she is wasting their time trying to find the best Internet connection by mapping network signal strength and displaying it graphically.  I find it useful and hope others will too.
1451695195|3.0|I appreciate the fact that the subject was handled well without apparent religious prejudice.  It left me a little empty, though.  The book feels &#34;slight&#34; without much depth.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app pulls stations some of the other &#34;affiliated&#34; services do not.  I appreciate that, now I have a total menu of Internet served radio that caters to my listening enjoyment.  I just wish this technology was available in automobiles, but feel it's getting to that point.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Interesting characters, a complex but not hard to follow set of storylines, and excellent production values make this a show I can't stop watching. I believe the hype, &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is a fantastic show.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|You won't get tell-all nuggets, but Tina Fey is hilarious and it's never at anyone's expense.  I really didn't get why it was called &#34;Bossypants,&#34; when she was just growing in her competence and juggling so much.  A little unnecessary bad language--she doesn't need to go in for shock value.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome series, it is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. I can't wait to see season 4!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was born in 1981 so I don't know how much fact vs. fiction is involved in &#34;Argo&#34; but I can tell you that as a film this movie is tense the way a piano wire is tense! I literally had no idea what was going to happen from one moment to the next and it just keeps building the pressure on these characters.<br /><br />The performances were good, although I don't know that they were great. The movie is shot kind of like a gritty 70s cop show with crazy zooms and shaky camera work. Will Arnett and John Goodman are briefly in it but highly under utilized.<br /><br />I really recommend this movie, it's just a really great study of a messed up event from our history and how luck and a bit of ol' fashioned American ingenuity might just save the day....but will that be enough?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Bummer that Andrea won't be joining next season.  Looks like Karl is going to give us some trouble but looking forward to more zombies in October!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This would have been 5 stars if the Scratch game wasn't random.  You don't get the prize you click on.<br /><br /> I gave it 4 stars because it is still fun despite that and glitches mentioned by earlier posters.<br /><br /> It has the most responsive customer service I have had the pleasure of contacting for an app.  Anna is a great help and tries hard to solve your problems.  When the game was updated and the dinosaurs I had obtained disappeared Gameloft was fair and helped me get them back.
1439102813|4.0|An easy read that takes you on the journey of early onset Alzheimer's as we see the disease consume Alice.<br /><br />My only qualm is that the book rushes to a close in a similar manner as the last Harry Potter book.  You get the sense that the author was tired of writing and needed to tie everything up in a neat bow.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|DDL becomes Lincoln. Very well done by Spielberg as usual.  Sally Field and the rest of the cast are excellent as well. Follows true events very closely.
0061978078|5.0|I loved this book! I read mostly YA lit because I teach high school English and I like to be familiar with what my students are reading. Delirium was a favorite of mine, so I purchased the trilogy for my classroom. Kids really love it! I have had a wait list to check these books out for months!!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|The first book was okay, but the second book was better and the third book was the best! It is romance and adventure and action packed. I had a hard time putting it down. I would highly recommend it.
B003UBTX7C|3.0|Of all the books I've read in this series this novel was lacking.  Usually I can't put a Baldacci book down, but I had to force myself to finish.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|So far no problem, I'll let you know in a few weeks!! Thats all I can say right now, Why do you care how many words I use???
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Love the book and find it an easy read; the March girls are so life like and still resonates with me and relationships with sisters.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Fun and challenging for engineers.  Watch your epic failures.  For the modest price I suggest paying the 2$ and forget the ads.
B008Y6RFBE|5.0|Magnificent performances by DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. Very compelling tale based in history and spun by a master of storytelling. This film truly draws you in and puts you back in time of a rarely remembered history of New York. One of my all-time favorites!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LIKE THIS APP A LOT. I CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT I WANT TO SAVE. I GET LOTS OF GREAT IDEAS FROM FRIENDS TO SHARE.
B008Y727AW|5.0|This film has a lot of awesome aspects of Kung Fu while being told with some humor and imagination. This film has a lot of flair and style while telling an amazing story and also keeping true to the Kung Fu traditions in cinema. One of my favorite martial arts films!
B00361R2VU|3.0|People love being frightened by surprises in movies.  I guess it's human nature for most, at least.  This movie has a lot of that, but it drags quite a bit, too.  It didn't live up to my expectations, but I'm glad I saw it.  I actually saw Part 2 first, and liked it better.  We watched Part 3 last night, and it was even better than the second one.  Pretty scary!
B0014DFCMS|5.0|Love the film, its seldom you see a movie where all the actors did a splendid job but this in fact was one of them. I have owned this movie once, gave it to my daughter who also loved it and I tried buying myself another copy however I picked the wrong seller who never shipped my product nor returned my money. But as for the film, don't hesitate to pick yourself up a copy, its sad, serious and funny throughout, especially if your a parent or a over protective father such as myself.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|Love the range on this release. Powerful riffs, lyrics and range. Had to be a tough project after the Rev but they accomplished what they set out to do.
B009QA3VY2|2.0|This is not the most enjoyable book I have read...difficult following the  plot at times.  The characters are not developed fully enough to appreciate their roles.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this is the best show on tv.  watch it, you will love it.<br />I just wished the storyline was faster.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of these characters as they make their way through murky memories, and the halls of their senior year to find their future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game allows you to be competitive with your friends and entertains for hours.  Once you get really good at it, you keep returning every day to try and beat your score
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's good and accurate for what it does, the weather. It's not the weather channel but it's close. It will do if you can't get the weather channel app. Very good app. for the tablet.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is really useful for quick notes or even quick storylines.  Its very compatible with other writing apps like Xwriter, and I use it a lot for writing quick drafts and organizing my storylines.  Very easy to use and very useful.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Romola's acting was really good for Emma. You could feel her anguish when she realizes her foolishness in trying to matchmake.
030746363X|5.0|At first, when I saw this book, I was skeptical. Could simply reading this give me rapid fat loss, incredible sex and the feeling of being super human?<br />Well, I've read it again & again & again. And the answer is Yes!<br /><br />I loved the \\"Choose-your-own-adventure\\" feel of the book. I could go at my own pace, picking & choosing parts that stood out to me - And I really enjoyed the feeling of being entertained while becoming a genius at the same time. The humor mixed with straight geeked-out science was brilliant!<br /><br />Definitely recommend this book whether you know very little about health & nutrition and are simply wanting to look better naked or you're a seasoned doctor looking for new ways to help others.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Excellent. This movie was my Husbands favorite of all the die hard movies.  He enjoyed it just as much as the first time he seen it.  As always I can find any movie I want on Amazon at reasonable prices.
044024613X|5.0|I enjoyed this book and give it a high recommend.  I wish I was in a book group with this one, because there are points that I would certainly enjoy discussing.<br /><br />There were significant legal errors, which for me at least were off-putting.  I nearly abandoned the effort, but I'm glad to have read through them. For example, in Massachusetts, in the case of a conflict of interest, an entirely different DA's Office would manage the case, it would be up to the DA, not an assistant to make that judgment.  A defendant can plead guilty to first degree murder, parole eligibility for a second degree murder is 15 not 20 years, the trial date would never come that quickly, Andy would be a potential witness in the case, and would not be permitted to enter an appearance and assist at trial.<br /><br />OK, that aside, the interweaving of the genetic component for murder/violence and the actions of the three principles -- grandfather, father, and son was fascinating as was the irony that a person who apparently did not have the gene actually committed a murder (perhaps ala Dexter).  The open ended finale was what I found most thought provoking.  There were no real answers here, and that suited the story quite well.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that there were points that dragged a bit, but at least for me they did not detract from the overall story.<br /><br />I recommend this book!
B00004YA66|5.0|We wanted to buy this movie for a fireman friend of ours but due to the fact that the movie is old, we were unable to purchase it at a store.  We were thrilled to find it on-line and out friend was even more thrilled to receive it.  It's a GREAT movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game u can create anything and save it for.anytime u should try it. its worth $6.99 to buy............d
B00AFROVQC|5.0|A fantasy should take you away and this book does. It sets a stage that captivates you. I will defnately read the next book. If you are looking for a book and fantasy is your preference then I recommend the Sorcerer s Ring without any hesitation
B003O86FMW|5.0|I personally enjoyed this story. In fact, I enjoyed this entire series of books. If you are into fantasy, then check out The Hunger Games series.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I think this is a pretty neat tool for kids to learn on.<br />It is handy for on the fly calculations.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I like all of the books in the Sigma series! Hope the characters survive the next book. A good read.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I keep playing this CD over and over, it is so good. I love when he sings in Italian, so romantic.
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|Why would Helen Hunt do this?  She is too good an actress to do something so desperate.  &#34;We Saw your Boobs!&#34;
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded it to my kindle. I am having so much fun playing it. My grandson told me about it. He has it on his Xbox.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I bought this album.  All of the songs on it are great and definitely worth listening to!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My whole family is hook on this show! We even sit around the dinner table discussing what might happen next.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Arrived shortly after ordering. Still in wrapping and seems to be brand new. Good deal for the money.  Good buy
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very descriptive writing keeps your attention all the way to the end as if your are there taking part in the story.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love love love this show! Ready for season 3 in prime. Nice to have an option with clean tv out there.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold's \\"pilgrimage\\" was completely absorbing and being of a certain age, I was able to relate to him and to his reasons for the<br />journey.<br />I grew to understand him, to admire him and to like him.<br />The descriptions and appreciation of people, weather conditions, flora and fauna were beautiful and painted vivid visual pictures.<br /><br />I did not understand his  yachting shoes, a plastic bag instead of a back pack, the entire lack of walking aids - but it added spice to the story.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it !
B001XUPD94|1.0|The movie wasn't good enough to be a movie,  only ok for a tv show. Only watch if you are a fan.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Summary - I wish the Artist Series cover had the same good looks as the Prologue, or that the Prologue had the same features as the Artist Series cover.<br /><br />I recently had the opportunity to review the Verso Prologue Case Cover and the Verso Artist Series case cover, both for the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The Verso Prologue case is cool in that it looks like an actual book.  It's a nice fit for the Kindle, although the elastic straps seem like they might wear out with time.  It has a handy pouch on the inside for tucking papers into.  Pebbled look of cover helps hide scratches and slight stains.  Easy to open and lay flat but the cover does add significant weight to the Kindle.  It lacks a latch to keep it closed which would be nice.<br /><br />Verso Artist Series case is very different.  Note that this is the \\"Swedish Wonder\\" case since not all the Verso Artists series case covers have the same features.  The Swedish Wonder cover has scratch fabric which is not comfortable for laying on bare legs/arms.  The design isn't really that attractive in my opinion - the colors of the words are not complementary so overall not aesthetically pleasing.  It's really nice to have the built in stand with the ability to change reading angle, and is noticeably lighter than the Prologue case.  The elastic strap to hold cover closed is nice but could have been a nicer elastic / more attractive.
B00742H26M|5.0|I've always enjoyed watching period pieces. This one is exceptionally delightful and worth watching again. And again! I especially enjoyed a younger Johnny Miller.

B009RH973I|1.0|This is for a kindle reader, why does this only allow hands-free lying on its side?  I am very unhappy with this.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show. Great characters and great creative writing.  Always wondering what they will think up next.<br />I am totally addicted.
0553296981|4.0|although it shows signs of wear, i have no complaints. it suits the cost. :D i am happy about it and cant wait to read it
B004HW7JH4|5.0|loved every moment of the episodes.  Can't wait for Season 6 to be available on DVD.  Will probably watch the entire series over and over again.
B003VA3JUO|5.0|I got the movie earlyer than expected great love it thanks it work perfectly watch it over and over again
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was very funny and entertaining I loved that it is so tempting to turn the pages
B0029LCJJS|4.0|An &#34;original&#34; take on Henry and the evolution of his take on the monarchy, papacy and courtly machinations.  I have enjoyed it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|So far so good. Only at level three. A bit early to give a review. Maybe I'll add to this later.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family. It is funny and had great points about life in the movie.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I've the third one is great so I drugged thru this to get there.  The characters are amazing but tedious at times.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I didn't like it as much as the other 2 books. It felt more like the rest of 2nd book than a story on its own.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Peter Jackson has done an amazing job interweaving the appendices from LOTR with The Hobbit.  The result is a film that really helps tell the tale of Middle Earth, it's just not the children's story from the original Hobbit.  (For that story, see the Rankin-Bass TV version.)
0316069434|5.0|Excellent book.  Keeps you interested throughout the book.  Twist, turns and excitement.  Glad  ordered it and enjoyed it very much.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Moved along very quickly, still kept reminding us of her family background. Lucy was part of the story but did not get involved to the extent that she usually does.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham is never disappointing.  Have read ll of his books.  This one really hd a suprise and twist at the end that I never expected.  Good Read.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I seriously love this game!! It is so much fun... one problem is I play it so much that I don't sleep at night... whoops!!!
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|This was very easy to install.  I think I will use it.  The program is useful for many application.  Thanks
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|There is something about wanting to beat the clock or improve my score that keeps me going back to this game....that and wondering what difficulties the next step has.  I do also like that there different game available within this game.
B007W4OZ76|5.0|this is easy to download.  Installing is also the ape.  The price is also in my range.  Thank you very much.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I like this one despite the fact that I have been stuck on one floor for days now.  I would like to be able to pick up from where I left off however.  Everytime I go back I seem to have to start at that floor all over again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun to play.  Very easy to download.  I can get lost in the game and not realize what time it is.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This was a very fun movie and enjoyed every moment of it.  It is one that we will watch again.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it is awesome it is a cool and fun way to get music and you can use it whenever you want without Internet
B009HV2JT8|5.0|If you like vampire movies you should see this one!!  Great story with a mix of this country's history of the civil war mixed with vampires.  Action and great special effects!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is an awesome app to get get it right away as soon as possible run go it get it now.I had to have at 20 words I had just pit it was ok
B00008J2PG|5.0|What a wonderful story!!!  After saying what a wonderful story this is I don't think any more words are really necessary, do you?
B0055SWM08|5.0|I turn this on and almost immediately slip into a more relaxed state. The music is calming, almost a necessity since the puzzles themselves do become more challenging.  I've yet to experience any of the gremlins mentioned elsewhere so I can't speak to the frustration, other than not figuring any particular out fast enough to suit myself.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a movie in ages.  A must see and most definitely deserves all the praise it has received....and more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Engaging and entertaining for all agges I appreciate the fact that it is not necessary to keep the wifi hot to make it work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved Season Threea of WD!!!  Great continuity and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what's going to happen to the gang next!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I actually didn't think I was going to like this book. I sort of read it by mistake. The trouble was, I couldn't put it down. I was hooked. And honestly that's the very best kind of story.
B004AP9W46|3.0|this one has not been my favorite so far in the vampire cronicles, it gets a little too deep into religion and theology for my taste. it follows true to Lestats ongoing need to address his religious struggle with &#34;goodness,&#34; but actually visiting heaven and hell as places kind of gets lost on me. i followed the book through to the end, enduring all the back and forth and long winded stories and narration by Memnoch, the book really got good towards the end after all the talking and story telling was done and finally we were moving into the purpose of the interaction between the two characters. on to the next! hopefully i'll find the characters back in the real world, feet on the ground and not talking to ghosts in the night.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Maybe not the best season, but still so very good. It helped bring me back in the world of the doctor after a almost 10 year break.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|The cat app is hilarious this is just a cheap knock off.  It doesn't do anything and my kiddos were very upset with it
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really did enjoy this movie, of course with most books that turn into movies the book was better, but that's expected!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The writing keeps you interested.  It is fast paced with enough variety to keep your mind racing.  Better than going to see a movie :-)
B009FZHYKU|2.0|It is so far from the book it's no longer even close to the same show. I get that they need to keep everyone interested but you can't kill off main characters that are still alive in the book, and HUGE parts of later aspects of the book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Yes, it's very addictive but lots of fun! A great reason to play with others! The loading time is needed for a &#34;rest&#34; between dives.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love Mr. Baldacci's writings.  Keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.  Great job as usual.  Really like following the John Puller character.  What a hero.
B008NB0SQO|4.0|I love the Muppets, and I love this film. I just don't understand why they could not have included, at least as an &#34;extended&#34; option like they have before, &#34;When Love is Gone.&#34; It's a great song, and it does add to the story and overall feel of the film.<br />As an aside, I love the Disney intermission, especially the segment with the Swedish Chef!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel has always come through for me. This app has exceeded my expectations. I have weather info at my fingertips. A must!
B008LXZFH6|2.0|This was supposedly Will Ferrel's funniest movie, at least that's what I heard before I watched it. Honestly, the saving grace to this movie is Steve Carrell. I laughed pretty much every time he opened his mouth, or was even on the screen. Otherwise, this was, at best, OK.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This of course is a must have app. This app helps me connect on my Kindle to the social network. Would recommend.
B000001FHV|5.0|Meat Puppets are a great band.  I wish I bought this album when it came out,  Anything that came out of that era of music was usually great.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app works in conjunction with other apps. Anything youtube is great to own. I am more equipped for downloads.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is so well written and executed, it truly does get you hooked.  The scenery and wardrobe are amazing.  I so like the way that the show is filmed in different perspectives.
B000YKG5IC|5.0|I have never enjoyed listening to reggae music until I vacationed in the Caribbean this year. This album gave me a better appreciation for Bob Marley and his musical talents. Now I know what people have been talking about when discussing Bob Marley. I enjoy this album.
B008602KQI|3.0|I read the book and didn't think the movie would be as compelling. While the movie missed a lot of the shadings of each person's personality, it hit the main points of the story to make it a good adventure but lacking in character development. Jennifer Lawrence was very good but could not save the shallow script. The book will probably become a classic but not this movie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I did not use Pinterest much until I put this app on my Kindle. I enjoy looking at the great ideas people have created. If you are into Pinterest, this is the app for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome!!!!!! Each update that subway surfers has the fame just keeps getting better and better. I love how they give you second chances now! I love this game !!!! :)
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Very good app to support other apps. Adobe always has awesome products and that is why I wanted this one. I would recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is really entertaining. i enjoy it. the kids enjoy it. coworkers enjoy it. we have friendly competitions on who can go the furthest. this game is great.
B004I744AS|5.0|I needed a dictionary. Myself or someone else always has a question about how to spell something. This app. helps give you the info needed at your fingertips.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I love this album, and I'm not a JT fan! I guess I am now. Timbaland hooked him up with the beats. Wish there were more songs though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is a must! I like having a calculator at my fingertips. It fills the screen, easy to read and use. I love it!
B008BM9L72|4.0|Beside all of the so called erotica-I enjoyed the romantic love story. How a woman can change a man and how much he wanted to change.Especially a rich man, loved the private jet, personal shopper, sports car.... need I say more?
B008Y73940|5.0|Matthew can teach me life lessons any day! Good plot, well developed. Very real life and holds interest. Thanks not one of his best performances but good movie
B0079TQHDO|5.0|just as &#34;can't put it down&#34; as Chronicles 1. These are among his best work. Maybe even his best. Maybe.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|I always thought my toys were alive as a child. I loved watching this film because of that dream as a kid. The movie explores the fear that we all have of being replaced but at the same time keeps the audience laughing.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This series just keeps getting better. The sad thing is, that there is no indication from Kindle as to when Chronicles 4 will be available.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|Very few sequels live up to the original but this sequel I like even better than the fabulous first film! The back story on Woody is interesting and the siren-call of fame and glory shows interesting aspects of Woody's character. And the movie elicits many laughs!
B006YC74E8|5.0|There are so many cool thing you can do on this you can change the colors add words to the pictures. Much more things you must get this app
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I grew up watching X-men cartoons so I am biased towards this film. I think Hugh Jackman brings a depth to Wolverine that I don't remember from the old cartoons.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I say, Good Show ol' man!  Well done! Bravo!<br />(Read this with a British accent.)<br />Interesting show with views of the elite and the servants.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie introduced me to the world and legend involving Mal and a simple ship and crew. After seeing this movie, I promptly purchased the television series &#34;Firefly&#34; because I wanted more. Few things are more fun than great sci-fi. It takes you to new places to explore deep, age-old questions of humanity.
B00846REIS|5.0|I  just loved it......................  Well written. I took this book on a cruise. Sylvia Day book's are always great. Looking forward to the next one
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this television show because of the fresh way of looking at the fairy tales and the inherent characters. The introduction of new characters is exciting and engaging. I like the flashes between past and present. Also, Rumpelstiltskin is an incredibly complex character with an astounding back story.
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|While the songs on this CD are lush arrangements with tremendous vocals, I'm a little disappointed in the aspect they sound like big band and Vegas lounge days. Of course that is reflective of the true industry astuteness that Anka's years have proven. And with a little research I could have known better how these songs would sound. I was just hoping they would seem a little more intimate with sparse arrangements. There is a little too much Wall of Sound for me. That isn't to say others won't find this collection to be excellent.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr. He is hilarious as Sherlock Holmes. The dynamic between he and Jude Law is impeccable. And the music is intriguing. Such a great film!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|If you are a mother of a daughter (particularly) ready to go into the work force, this is a must read.  I think that there are many issues that young girls could be aware of and Sheryl Sandberg points many things out.  It's not a how to book, but really a conversation that should be continued.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This film is fabulous: the story, music, and comedy. I simply love it. This childhood favorite is a great buy!
B00340ESIS|5.0|I had to rent this book for my creative writing class, and I loved it so much, I bought it for my own use!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This movie is fantastic! I love that Mulan is an assertive protagonist who is motivated by love of family and country. I laugh every time I watch this movie as well!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Love the PLL tv series? READ THE BOOKS! They're very easy reads, interesting, and captivating! I'm reading them until the next season premieres!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love superhero films. Each of the films leading up to this one are great. Then this film is absolutely fabulous. I loved that each character had their own moment to shine. I loved the interplay between the characters. I loved the Hulk-the new actor is fantastic and the monster has some incredible moments.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|Great album, great pump up music! Very catchy and fun! Guetta's done it again, and this album features some really great feat. Artists
B0001I561E|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a kid and loving every minute of it. Twenty years later and I still love each of those minutes!
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|Such a cute film! It's a but dramatic at times, but very good! McLaine is so adorable and Lemmon is so dorky and lovable
B004SBQAN8|5.0|This film is incredibly fun. I love the abilities that Four and Six show during the movie. The ending fight sequence is exciting. The teen love story is hilarious, the nerdy friend has great one-liners, and Four's protector has a dry humor that induces laughter.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|OMG.  I was hoping for a campy spoof. But this was painful. I don't know why I watched the whole thing.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|The first Mission: Impossible had one of the most engaging story lines I've ever seen. While the story line of this film isn't as engaging, the acting and action in the film is fantastic. I love the climb up the building. The tech guy is hilarious in this movie.
B0034G4P1W|4.0|Got thi s for my 5 year old grandson after renting it numerous time from library. He really likes it so thought we might as well own it.<br /><br />It has paid for itself already ; )
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having grown up with Star Trek and Doctor Who, I realize that I am biased when it comes to intriguing sci-fi films and television shows. I found myself astounded at the level of development of the culture in this show (like the way they talk and the Chinese influence). The stories are enjoyable and the characters are rich. The commentary on humanity is clear and the laughs are frequent-best of both worlds! I would easily watch another season; it's a shame they canceled the show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a wonderfully crafted story.  A complex world with many characters and a shifting reality.  Really makes you think about how we order our world.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I doubt first sequels; second sequels are even more dubious. However, this movie just blows away all doubts. I love this movie. The ending to this story is completely satisfying. Change is inevitable, but it can provide satisfaction and service as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a lovely game with attractive graphics and realistic horses. The options are appealing and fun. I would recommend it to those who like horses. :)
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I usually do not read Stephen King and bought the book by accident. What a surprise when I decided to test a little of the book. Mr. King tells a fascinating tale. I could not put down the book.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun and easy match game for when you just want to pass some time. I use it in the waiting rooms of doctors offices to pass the time more quickly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The grandson downloaded it to my Kindle so that he would have something to play when he comes to visit.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very intertaining keep mind and body stimulate you want to win u need to know what's at the next level
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Yes it's great,keeps me from doing housework ,husband hates it,time goes by too quick,and have to fight kids from using it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love Dinosaurs and loved Jurassic park ever since I was a kid! Lots of Dinos to work with and some od them are really cute!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I think you're going to love this game if you love shooters! The graphics are heavily reminiscent of 80s style arcade shooters, there are three difficulty levels a LOT of variety in enemies and the game is very responsive.<br /><br />There's no replacement for having an arcade stick when it comes to shooters that require twitch reaction but the responsiveness helps me enjoy the heck out of this game. I can't see any reason for leaving less than a 5-star rating.<br /><br />Have fun! Peace!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had never really heard about this show and gave it a shot on a whim. I am hooked and love the show!
B0013FSXSC|4.0|All movies in the era from 900ad to 1500ad are the most exciting.  It's too bad that there aren't more!  This is an old favourite and I'm never hesitant to watch it.  It is good that I could buy it from Amazon as its distribution has been stopped in Australia.  Another top addition to my library.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is a great album and arrived on time and in good condition.  Taylor is growing up and it shows in her music.  Also the lyrics in the album (booklet) contain secret messages about each song.  Fun to decode.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert, writing reviews is not exactly my strong suit but I made an exception because this book is truly insightful, helpful, enlightening, and fantastically whimsical at times. I devoured this book, going through a wide variety of emotions as I read. I alternately felt: accepted, understood, misunderstood, excluded, excited, sad, proud, defiant, and motivated. Just when I thought I wasn't the type of introvert that Cain was describing, she showed me something new about myself without being condescending or asking me to change anything about myself. She subtly changed my perception of my own personality and motivated me to share this newfound acceptance and pride with those who are closest to me without ever really telling me to do so. I feel more prepared to approach most relationships in my life and know how to ask for what I need.
1400069807|1.0|[There are too many reviews for mine to matter, but I have to get this off my chest.]<br /><br />I was excited to see this book on the shelves (sorry, Amazon, but you get plenty of my money other ways!), as it promised to explore an issue I've cared about for a long time.  I grabbed it immediately.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is a tragedy.<br /><br />Of course, it is also _about_ a tragedy.  It dives reasonably deeply into our modern-day catastrophe:  America's obesity epidemic.  It lays out the roles big-business processed-food companies and Wall Street played in creating the problem, and the challenges we all face in trying to address it.  It even attempts to be fair-minded.  We're facing a substantial national crisis that needs all the attention it can get:  In that sense alone, we should all be glad this book exists.  Mr. Moss clearly spent an enormous amount of time gathering information and developing relationships with fantastic sources.  The data behind this book are incredible and well cited, and justify slogging through it; if you can make it through, you'll find many powerful anecdotes and, sometimes, horrifying bits of information.<br /><br />If.<br /><br />It is a slog.  There are errors in grammar and punctuation that should embarrass a high school student.  Important components of the crisis, like household food economics, HFCS (and the fact that HFCS could have -combated- the obesity epidemic instead of fueling it), the diet-fad industry and the dangers of its pseudo-medicine, and both basic- and clinical medical research are under-explored or, at times, misunderstood.  The information that is presented is often muddled, repetitive, or, somehow, both.  In fact, the book manages to feel far too long, while covering a topic that deserves even more of its story told.<br /><br />Making the basic mechanical issues worse, the book suffers horribly and throughout from \\"New York City Writer Syndrome.\\"  If Mr. Moss learned something,  there's simply *no*way* anyone else could already have known.  If Mr. Moss figures something out, there's simply *no*way* someone else was already there ahead of him.  If Mr. Moss had a hard time understanding something, it must be unimaginably incomprehensible to we mere mortals not lucky enough to be included in the NYC sphere of influence.  Clearly, we should all be grateful for his patronizing tone and his willingness to share his incredible knowledge with our wee brains.  Its language reeks of the misguided, unjustified, smug self-confidence of an A- student at a C+ school who is *certain* that his presentation is the best anyone has ever seen... while actually being one that would have been laughed out of a more competitive academic ecosystem.<br /><br />Perhaps worst of all, fundamentally it's a scattered mess.  This might be most directly demonstrated by the fact that it is broken into three sections... titled _Salt_Sugar_Fat_... then presented as (1) Sugar, then (2) Fat, then (3) Salt.  Did the book start as a more numerous series of small essays no one bought?  Shuffling note cards together might explain the narrative structure.  Did it change editors in mid-stream?  Has Mr. Moss been working on it \\"off and on\\" for so long, gotten so lost in the weeds, that the core, driving tale was lost?  Regardless of the reasons, it is not a compelling read, and that's a shame.<br /><br />It could have been a gripping, ground-breaking, buy-copies-for-all-your-friends book of massive importance.  Instead, it's a hard-to-read, hard-to-recommend mess, and that is a loss for all of us.<br /><br />I think it struck a particularly sensitive combination of nerves for me -- words are important, the topic is important, and many people got paid a good bit of money to put this thing together... yet it's almost so bad as to be counterproductive.  Maybe it's a two-star book, as there -are- interesting facts and things to take home from it, but it loses a point for the combination of arrogant presentationyet sheer magnitude of wasted potential.  Maybe it's a 5 star book, if you set aside the medium and care only about the message, and don't mind doing the work required to extract the gems, but words, language and storytelling are important.<br /><br />It could have been incredible.  If Mr. Moss or any of the people behind the book would like a hand whipping it into something much more gripping for version 2.0, let me know.yet sheer magnitude of wasted potential.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|If I were to give this game a percent it would definitely be 100 because it keeps me busy during the day
B004PGO25O|5.0|Good medicine for any writer.<br />First recommended by my mentor, Patricia Ryan Madson, Pressfield's handy little book has been my bible for the last two years. He breaks down resistance with quotes, anecdotes, humor and compassion.<br />This is the kind of book you can pick up and read from any page. For me, it has worked every time. Not sure I will read any of his novels, but that is not his point.<br />Highly recommended for anyone trying to finish anything.
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|This movie is a perfect blend of sentiment, quirkiness, and happy endings.  There are so few movies that I really enjoy watching, and this one exceeded expectations.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Beatiful piece, very flexible in terms of options to use. We love them. Size is surprizingly. We still did not install but we can see the quality of the material.
B00138KFYO|5.0|No one can ever replace the amazing Janis Joplin.  Her raspy voice and gutsy, bluesy delivery sets my soul on fire.  This CD brings her back to life!
0739341243|1.0|I am an introvert and a highly sensitive person. I tend to read everything I can on introverts and usually I find this empowering. The Introvert Advantage by Marti Olsen Laney, Psy.D was a far, far better book that has not gotten nearly the publicity it should have. I found Quiet not empowering but depressing and poorly written. The multiple chapters spent dissecting why Americans value extroverts were unnecessary and discouraging. The message I came away with loud and clear from Quiet is that Americans are extroverts and introverts are misfits and freaks. This was something I already knew. I need to move back to the UK!!
B0085LMFAE|5.0|When Graceland appeared in the 80's it blew me away.  So original with catchy songs performed with an African influence.  Paul Simon is a genius.  So many artists come out with more of the same but Paul Simon created a masterful and original genre that had huge commercial success.  Graceland is a must own classic for your music collection.
B002WY65VU|5.0|My stepdaughter (17) received it in the Mail Yesterday and it was faster than Expected! she Loved it! Its A Great Movie!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best shows  I've seem in a long time.  It's griping, perfectly cast with interesting plots. This is a must see series.
B009LXECF6|5.0|Bruno Mars really out did himself on this one.  I didn't think he could top his last CD.  However, he did it.  You go Bruno!!!!!  So talented!!!
B00B23O96A|5.0|As I love Eric anything he does is great, but this one is out of the box. It's a new smooth Eric. Wonderful.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This was an excellent flash back to the past for this series.  It made me want to go back and watch all of the movies again.  I'm moving to the Shire soon!!  ;  )
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|It's been long known that Jesse Leech left Killswitch Engage early on when they were touring behind Alive Or Just Breathing. So I'm sure there's some fans that have certain reservations about him especially after being very accepting of Howard Jones, who unfortunately parted due to his inability to maintain his type 2 diabetes problem. Immediately in the back of my head, I thought Jesse should be coming back. Hearing the first single \\"In Due Time\\" for the first time, it kind of sounded like the Killswitch of today, but with Jesse. Sort of like a \\"best of both worlds\\" vibe, old and new. They certainly haven't missed a beat. After the somewhat disappointing self-titled record, where they ventured into more accessible territory, Disarm The Descent shows that they've rebounded with even heavier songs. Guitarist and producer Adam Dutkiewicz once again oversaw production while Andy Sneap returned to mixing & mastering for the first time since The End Of Heartache. I have to comment about Andy Sneap. Lately, a lot of people are criticizing that everything he's mixed/mastered sounds \\"sterile\\" or he's taken the balls out of the music, or whatever. I've listened to many albums he's worked on: Machine Head, Killswitch Engage, Exodus, Job For A Cowboy, Napalm Death, Chimaira, Earth Crisis, DevilDriver, Kreator, Testament, Trivium, Arch Enemy, etc. Almost everything I've listened to that he's been involved with is perfect, especially this cd. Last I checked he's producing the new Amon Amarth, and he's mixing the new Carcass. Obviously, he's doing something right. Enough about that, get the special edition. It features 4 bonus tracks including 2 live tracks from 2012, and a dvd with the making of the record.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good romping read. Roller coaster and darkly fun. Leaves you thinking, even if you recognize that the very flawed individuals also need some psychological intervention!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Interesting plot idea, but weak characters.  There was no reason to care about any of the characters or the eventual outcome of the story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app, so many books to choose from.  So easy to use, I am in readers heaven, yea!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|this is a great game for kids.easy. to play and understand.would recommend to any who has kids its really fun
B00A72989U|1.0|The only version of Girl on Fire on this album has Nicki Minja rapping all over it.  Totally ruins the song.  It did say the song was featuring her so I should have known better.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Interesting look at the behind the scene negotiation to pass the 13th amendment, I felt ordering in HD wasn't worth it since the movie was very dark and felt like I was watching it in black and white.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This entire season is about to probe the possibilities for further continuation of this show's story. A few episodes are perhaps just to linger on the show however, the entire season is interesting and worth seeing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Just recently started watching this show and seem to be going through an episode or two a night. Very addictive!!
B004NDVJWI|5.0|I loved this, it was new and different. It was a completely different sound than before but it was still the boys that I have loved ever sense I heard 5 Colours. I really enjoyed Shine A Light, If U See Kate, and That's the Truth. I'd recommend buying it because there are some really great songs, and not giving up on this CD because it sounds different.<br /><br />The service was great! I got this within a week of it shipping. Very satisfied with the seller!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Ever since I found out that Brandon Sanderson was writing the last three books of WOT I have Immersed myself in his writing so I would have a better understanding of what I was in for. He has not disappointed me or made me doubt the choice made by Harriet and Tor yet. Today I will begin reading AMOL and I can't wait to see how rand and his wives and all his friends save the world.this book was wonderful. Shai is complex and brilliant and to see her put her mark on the world in her own way was wonderful. Thank you Brandon for always giving me something new and exciting to read.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Not only a story of a possible bleak future for mankind but a ray of hope.  We may make a mess of it, but the seed of humanity may still prevail.
0307887898|5.0|As an aspirational entpreneur with a background in engineering and business, this book made a lot of sense. I never realized that there was a lot of waste in the entrepreneurial process. There are lessons in this book that I will immediately start applying to my corporate job to see what will work and what won't.
1576875776|5.0|Her photography is so rich, simple and iconic of the time. I love this book and have often taken it to friends' houses to show it to them. A must have for photography collectors.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|I loved this book so much. Great characters and an intriguing plot that kept me riveted the whole book through. Fabulous twist at the end which I didn't see coming. Excellent! Unputdownable. Couldn't recommend this book highly enough.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode doesn't disappoint with their new album. With a slight nod to some of their poppish early works, most of this album is grinding and sexy.
B004XANKVO|5.0|i bought this pack for weekly travel to DC for business.<br />i carry two computers and they fit well.<br />the pockets are strategically placed and work well.<br />thule seems to have hit the curve with the crush proof pocket, cell phone pockets in the computer area, and a slot for your ipad or nook.<br />the front pocket holds lickey-chewies and my toilet kit.<br />can't go wrong.<br />this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for, buy cheap buy twice.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A wonderful story about a tragic and dark time in history -- Hitler's Germany -- and how love, words, books, and music can shine through the darkness.
B0000AKCLS|4.0|A must if you like Joe. The man can play a mean guitar. Added to the Joe Bonamassa collection. Great traveling music.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|I've read all editions of Discovering Statistics Using SPSS (from Andy Field). It's a great and funny book to learn basic and deep statistics and to learn how to use SPSS (this 4th edition has been illustrated with SPSS version 21 but it's very similar to old versions of the software). I strong recommend it.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|If you like Beth Hart you'll like this. She can sing and he can play the guitar better than most anyone else.
B00C7LB20C|3.0|Great Movie EXCEPT....  Soundtrack overbears talking in most of the movie and you are straining simply to hear what they are saying due to the loud soundtrack.  The sound mixer really blew it on this movie.
B00991TCOG|4.0|This young lady can sure play a violin. This is a great CD for relaxing in the hot tube or driving.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game so much I hope u make more like it. it is a lot like Mario. leps is a game where u try to get past the level by running and jumping over stuff
B004I744AS|5.0|There when I need it. there are always times I can not spell or remember things, and this is a quick helpful guide.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a very engrossing, quick read. The characters were engaging. I know some of what happened to slaves from reading and watching &#34;Roots&#34; and this added to my knowledge.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Very nice. who doesn't like Bingo, I enjoy being able to play while waiting for a Dr, visit or a appointment where yu have to sit awhile.
B009S33I68|5.0|This book clearly tells the story of the main battle including the buildup and also the follow-up battles. I have seen the movie but this book was much better. The content shows us what went right, what went wrong, and everything in between. It even gives insight into the North Vietnamese viewpoint. I will read it again.
1401232590|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He absolutely loved it. The items were packaged nicely and came quickly in the mail.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Generally speaking, we know through history the accomplishments that Lincoln made while he was President. However, those accomplishments are often shadowed by the assassination. I thought this film was fantastic; great cast, great directing, great story. I felt as if there could not be a more accurate depiction of Lincoln and his heart for the cause. Good Stuff!
1401233791|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He absolutely loved it. The items were packaged nicely and came quickly in the mail.
B003008RWA|5.0|It shows how much the US is in such poor shape, both our healthcare system and our overall heath as a nation. Rather depressing.
006074815X|5.0|I have become a fan of Ken Follett.  This is the 5th book of his I have read and find that he does an excellent job of engaging the reader with his characters.  The stories are woven with twists and turns that keep the reader turning pages as quickly as possible.  The story does not present the predictability that many stories do thus allowing the reader to stay intrigued by what will happen next.  I have currently begun another of his novels and hope to continue enjoying his books for months ahead.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Our 7 and 9 year olds love Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  They will sit and read any of these books forever.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I found the ending slightly disappointing. I loved the way the author switched from the man's to the woman's voice in alternating chapters and how she used this device in the first half to alternate between the present (man's voice) and the past (woman's diary).She cleverly moved our sympathies from one to the other as the story progressed
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Superb movie. Phenomenal dramatics!!
B0012GMY64|5.0|I have always loved Andy Williams' singing.<br />I have LP's of his, but my record player 'gave up the ghost' a while ago.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is really just as good as its users. The app does not have really any glitches and if so are addressed promptly ... Now if they could just keep those annoying people off of it;)
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The sword of truth series is my all-time favorite collection of books.<br />Stone of Tears has it all: action, adventure, magic, demons, love. A riveting read from beginning to end.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|I have had to put all kind of controls on my Kindle.  My little 2 yr old loves to change screens and to play puzzles.  However, this game is to hard for him.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love this show.  Can't go wrong with Big Bang Theory.  Too bad I have to purchase now that I don't have cable..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When the kids started using this function on my phone I thought that it was another wasted time killer.  Then I tried it.  There is a lot of (hidden) math/geometry that has to be considered to solve the puzzles.  Part of the difficulty in this game is because you have to fill in every box on the grid and you can't trace over any lines.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I'm convinced it is just not possible to fully capture on screen (big or small) the depth, character, quality, dramatic adventure, heart-wrenching emotion, and the promise and hope found in true friendship offered in these phenominal tales. This movie was a good attempt and I appreiate the effort, but my mind kept wandering to the book. The movie was okay; I don't regret watching it but I do regret that some will only watch this and never know the magic and majesty of JRR Tolkien's books.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love it because a lot of women always say that if their husband ever cheated they would be gone.  Oh would you really. I love the way Alisha is handling this awful situation. Showing us that women can be strong and still try to keep her family together. Basically it is what is, and I must do what i must do to keep not only me safe but my family as well.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This is very well done, however, it is also very loooong.  I love almost everything about it, but admit I fast forwarded a collective 20 or so minutes :D
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read this one in hopes of redemption from Gone Girl. This one was written better with the ending not leaving you hanging. Glad I gave the author another chance. Fun read if you call twisted families and murder fun.....
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The film takes place in 1965 on an idyllic New England island, New Penzance, bringing together two semi-nerds. Sam Shakusky is at a 'Khaki Scout' summer camp, and Suzy Bishop lives on the island with her attorney parents. The two had met the previous summer and had been pen pals since, making a secret pact to run away together. Sam brings camping equipment, Suzy takes six books, her cat, and a record player.<br /><br />Turns out Sam's an orphan and his foster parents don't want anymore of him after hearing of his latest escapade. Sam and Suzy's future together looks dark, despite their 'getting married,' until police commander Sam Sharp gets involved.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|Great watch, get many compliments, band is low quality but overall very satisfied with purchase. I recommend. Four stars for band.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was entertained. Good movie. I am looking forward to the other novels made into movies. I need two more words for this review. Done.
B0067R0APK|2.0|The app is okay, but the opening page is not where I would expect. And I had already paid for the platinum on my smart phone. That instance appears differently than on my Kindle Fire. Go figure!
B00192IOBA|4.0|More than half is awesome. All album is ok. It is worth for my $5. I like it. Good job Jason.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|FS is War of the Worlds on steroids! Excellent effects, compelling storyline (and archs) and engaging characters! Best SciFi story on TV since the reimagined BSG series left the airwaves!
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a fun book to read. I really liked the lawyers in this book. What a great combination of characters.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|THE BIG BANG THEORY is one of the funniest series i ever seem!!!! the dialogues are totally inspired, the characters are great and all the stuff together shows a great show for everyone!!!!! The first season is AMAZING!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!WELL DONE, SHELDON!!!!!!!!!!!
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I agree with the others though, they should have left &#34;No Diggity&#34; from the Riff-Off the way it was in the movie. Otherwise, great album!
B003GX5CWY|5.0|PREDATOR is a real classic!!!!! i saw this movie more than 30 times through my life, and it still amazes me how good the story, the characters and the Predator are....CLASSIC!!!!CLASSIC!!!! while i still think ALIEN is the coolest alien character ever, the PREDATOR creature shines on this movie!!!!! i TOTALLY RECOMMEND PREDATOR to everyone in the world with interest in sci-fi action movies!!!! This one is a true classic!!!!!!!WELL DONE, PREDATOR!!!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Too much graphic sex in the beginning. Too much cussing at times. Story line was good. Denzel Washington was great as usual.
B0047SF41G|4.0|The PREDATOR creature is one of the coolest aliens ever created for movies.....the first PREDATOR is a TOTAL CLASSIC, and the 2 is really good.....this one, PREDATORS is good....ok....not so special, even reminds me the story of the first classic one with a lot more explosions, blood and aliens.....the truth is....if you like the ALIEN-PREDATOR saga stick with the first 2 from PREDATOR and the first 3 from ALIEN....the rest got better special effects but not so good stories....but PREDATORS is way way way better than PROMETHEUS and the Alien vs Predator ones........
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Script was hard to understand at times. Interesting story. I guess this was a way for liberals to try and make Jimmy Carter look better as a President. Sorry, it doesn't work for me. I also wonder way we haven't heard about this story before 2012 if it is true. It makes me wonder how true it really is.  Still,  it was a pretty good movie.
B005SGXX1Y|5.0|THE BIG BANG THEORY is a great show for everyone....The characters are totally inspired and charismatic, the dialogues are all brilliant....i can´t really say which season is the best....try them ALL!!!!WELL DONE, BIG BANG!!!!!!!!
B00114RKT8|5.0|Great movie, inspiring. Acting was superb. The English are great actors in general. Love the bagpipes playing amazing grace at the end.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|SO FAR SO GOOD SO WHAT, the 3rd album from MEGADETH is another great fast punk THRASH METAL collection of great metal tunes like HOOK IN MOUTH, IN MY DARKEST HOUR and MARYJANE.....it´s not one of my favorites from the great MEGADETH like RUST IN PEACE or the first 2, but it´s MEGADETH!!!!yeah! MEGADETH is a metal icon!!!!!if you already like MEGADETH, you will enjoy it......yeah, MEGADETH RULES!!!!!
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I was all excited to watch this movie because of everything I heard.  I guess it is a movie to watch with a bunch of girls as I got tired of it very quickly.  The guys bodies were pretty nice.
B002P764NS|5.0|THE BIG BANG THEORY Is one of the greatest series i ever seem!!!!! really, i can´t say many series better than this one( FRIENDS, 2 and HALF MEN).....really funny and inspired!!!!!!WELL DONE, NERDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|Its a great movie for both boys and girls. Has wonderful songs and memorable scenes. If you already own it, you can decide if you want to buy it again. Everything is almost the exact same. We don't have a tape player, so I did buy the blu-ray / DVD pack.
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|After many spins on this LULU album, i gotta say.....This album had potential to be a very good album from METALLICA and LOU REED....but what i hear is both artists trying their best to take away all the charisma that the songs could had....They got some good riffs like on THE VIEW, FRUSTRATION, PUMPING BLOOD and CHEAT ON ME, but they take the songs to strange ways that are really not cool....a, and WHY 2 discs....They could EASILY dry some filler to 1 disc.... and where´s James, he only roars a few lines through this looooooong lulu trip.....it´s sad because i thought DEATH MAGNETIC was a great comeback album from METALLICA, but they choose to record this album after that......I love METALLICA, but they seem kinda lost.....SORRY, LULU.....
B00821OX98|4.0|Characters are great, plot is clear. Keeps you waiting and wondering what's coming next. Falling Skies is right up there with Star Gate S G-1
B0028RXXE8|4.0|Too bad it ran for only a couple of sasons. It was a good one and I really enjoyed it. I would not let my children see this type of show.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so cool. When I got it I thought it would be boring but it's not. You have to evolve your shark to get the next one. I would recommend you to get the game.
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|I didn't buy this movie because it had won Academy Awards.  I bought it because it's got some pretty cool and fresh action scenes and because I liked the concept.  It was nothing like the original short story, which I read for the first time last night, but again, I bought it because it'll be good in the background while I'm writing.  Both Colin Farrell and Kate Beckingsale give forgettable performances, as does Jessica Biel - they are just pretty people running around a dystopian world trying to save it or keep it the same.  Colin has had better roles, and Kate simply needs to find a job as someone other than the hot, kick-ass chick in black.  In the end, the hero saves the day and gets the girl; well, one could say that except that all that happens as a result of his destruction of &#34;The Fall&#34;, the device that transports cheap labor from Australia to Europe through the Earth's core, is that both the beautiful parts and the ugly parts of the world are left intact but are now isolated from one another.  So even at the end, the hero fails to improve anything at all other than to end the &#34;enslavement&#34; of the dregs of the world.  And yes, there's an underlying storyline that the evil overloards in Europe are rolling into the underbelly of society in Australia to kill off all the human waste, as it were, and replace them with robots, but all they really ever had to do was turn off The Fall, and that would have accomplished it.  So, none of it makes any sense at all.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I &#34;like this&#34; because it's got great action, not because it's interesting or smart.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Although this really is a delightfully entertaining movie, the two lead characters were so poorly developed that it was impossible to believe that either of them was worthy of the commitment they both had for one another.  Because the story was so uplifting and the humor so imaginative and well done, I really wanted to be able to love both of them, but that required too much of a blind leap of faith.  I kept expecting them to split up, to give up on one another because the relationship was so empty that it wasn't worth the effort.  All that being said, it was still one of the wittiest and most enjoyable movies I've seen in months.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|As usual, Andrea Bocelli puts together a beautiful mix of songs, this one includes Canto Della Terra, one of my absolute favorites. Great collection!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just an outstanding app irregardless of the fact that it fills such a wonderful need as a digital Bible.  I use this this app all the time BECAUSE it is just so well done.
0385040253|5.0|THE REFERENCE ON ROPEWORK. Not something to take camping with you but a book for a lifetime of learning and wonder. A desert island pick for sure.
0670026557|4.0|Being a giver can be a blessing and a curse.  But lo and behold it turns out, apparently, that being a giver is more important to success in the business world than being a cutthroat taker.  This book really delves into how and why this works, and what some of the pitfalls are for those who are generous, especially as they are trying to work their way up in the world.<br /><br />It's a little wordy in parts and could use some slimming down, but at no point did I think it was a tedious book.  A good read and perhaps an eye opener for those who think Gordon Gecko is the ultimate business model.
B002YDMWK2|5.0|The illustrations in this book make a great book even better.  We love it!<br />Book was in great condition as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife and I absolutely love this show. We can't wait for next season.  The show is a great mix of action, drama and suspense.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love watching this show! Many instances, I can completely relate. Others are just so darn funny I hurt the next day from laughing. Brilliant work. My kids are even quoting it and now &#34;Jinx lock&#34; is a daily routine at our house.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play. I like competing with my friends. Overall a great game. I also like that we earn coins and can buy boosts.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love the CD, the music always makes me feel happy even when I am not lol. Very unique blend of music.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Although I saw many of the reviews complaining about the ending of Requiem, I was still hoping I'd end up loving the final book in one of my favorite YA trilogies. Unfortunately I was disappointed along with many other readers and this book certainly left me leery over reading any future series by Oliver.<br /><br />What I Liked: I love Oliver's writing style--girl knows her way around a metaphor. Like the previous books, I felt completely transported to this dystopian society. There was a lot of action in the final book and the suspense was phenomenal. I had no idea what was going to happen and whether or not the Resistance would be able to defeat the society.<br /><br />The dual POV was also enjoyable. I liked seeing things from Hana's POV and being able to get a glimpse inside the head of a \\"cured.\\" Since I never read any of the novellas, I had missed Hana's character since she was last seen in Delirium.<br /><br />There were a few heartbreaking twists and the appearance of a few surprise characters I was happy to see pop up.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: The characters became very unlikable in the final book. Alex was a jerk to Lena and Lena was a jerk to Julian and Julian was just kind of there. I sympathized with all that they had been through, but their selfishness made me less invested in what happened to them.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />The romance was my least favorite part of the book, I disliked it almost as much as the open-ended conclusion. I liked Alex and Lena in the first book and Lena and Julian in the second book, but there was no chemistry between any of them in this book. I didn't feel the fight for love message that I assumed was the point of these books.<br /><br />After three books, readers are left not knowing how the romance turns out or if the Resistance wins. Several other character's fates are left hanging too (Tack? sob). On Oliver's blog, she says that she wrote the ending because she wanted readers to be able to continue imagining what happened next for the characters. Really? I have my own characters in my head, I don't want to do any work to figure out what happens to fictional characters, especially in the final book of a series.<br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />This is my least favorite book in the trilogy and I had a hard time figuring out a fair rating. I'm going to go with three stars because the book isn't terribly written and it's still an interesting story.<br /><br />Rating: 3/5 Stars<br /><br />I received a copy of the book in exchange for my honest review.happened next for the characters. Really? I have my own characters in my head, I don't want to do any work to figure out what happens to fictional characters, especially in the final book of a series.<br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />This is my least favorite book in the trilogy and I had a hard time figuring out a fair rating. I'm going to go with three stars because the book isn't terribly written and it's still an interesting story.<br /><br />Rating: 3/5 Stars<br /><br />I received a copy of the book in exchange for my honest review.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting authorship.  I had Malcolm written off as a bad guy half way through, only to be pleasantly surprised at the end.  Grisham writes them well.
B000062X90|5.0|I have always wanted to buy this album but for some reason never did.Now in 2013 it is my opportunity to realize what I have been missing all these years.This album is great from start to finish.It has this certain feeling..kinda like it's an old friend that you haven't seen in a long time..Great musicality!The live in Memphis bonus EP is also awesome..I am originially from Memphis but never saw these guys live???I would recommend this to anyone who likes great classic rock.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Do you like Black?<br />Do you like Keys?<br />Do you like El Caminos?<br /><br />How to describe this? Do you like The White Stripes pretending to be T-Rex?<br /><br />You do?<br /><br />That'll be a BUY then.
1250006341|5.0|We both thoroughly reading the behind the scenes information on this wonderful series.  This is beautiful book with excellent photography.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My granchildren had this movie and it made both them and my husband and I laugh.  It is always fun to share humor with the younger children in your life.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie is good, but if you don't really remember the Iran crisis, I probably wouldn't recommend it, unless you are a history junkie. It was a little dry at times.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|We have been through one VHS tape and 2 DVDs of this show and still enjoy watching it occassionally.  You will notice something new everytime you watch it.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, especially the acting which was superb. It was poignant and tastefully done. I recommend it.
B004G6009U|5.0|This was a gift to nieces and nephews.  My grandchildren already had the movie and continue to watch it repeatedly.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I was afraid it was going to be very predictable, but it wasn't. Denzel was very good.
0783240287|3.0|This was a good movie, but was better in the live theater.  Not sure why.  I thought it would be a good movie for grandchildren, but did not seem to hold their interest, even though the both love music.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie was okay, quite predictable, but entertaining. The acting was marginal, for the actors in it. Glad I didn't pay extra for it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Preston and Child's co written books.  I would recommend the Pendergast series.  I hope there will be more in the future.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Something to do when you have nothing else to do.  It's nice to have it on your tablet or phone when you are stuck waiting for something!
B0087EACJK|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game.  Easy and straightforward yet addictive enough to lose twenty minutes on. Worth the money.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Its the classic game of mahjong that we all know and love!  Nodistractions no popups no ads.  You'll love it.
0143118706|3.0|I can tell the author thinks like I do - she researched the heck out of marriage in different cultures and statistical data from every aspect.  This is a decent read with an adorable ending, but dry in parts.  They need to retire the jersey on Eat, Pray, Love - it just isn't fair to compare this book to that one.  A decent read, nonetheless.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent, very unique. Reminded me somewhat of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins in concept. Fast moving plot, with lots of action and suspence.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|I love this movie because its funny to see Tom cruise singing!!!  Though the girls voice can get pretty annoying.
B000QK7YQ2|4.0|Watched this for the first time after hearing about it for years.  Very enjoyable.  Very 70's (but being that it was made in '71, that makes sense).  It was interesting to see the professional racer with no pit crew, doing his own wrenching and hauling the bike everywhere in his van.  It was cool seeing Steve McQueen while he was mid-career.  If nothing else, this makes me want to buy a vintage MX bike.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is like Zoo Tycoon 2 mixed with  Jurassic Park.  This is just an awesome game full of excitement.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|:My daughter told me about this series and using my Amazon Prime to watch the second season on my roku was so easy and it was free.!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its really good because you can connect with your friends on Facebook and play agents them. I really recommend it:D
B002U6CJCO|4.0|Good continue action of previous episodes takes up where last left off makes a great whole series to watch at once.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Husband read this book & found it an interesting read. He was in the military himself & likes to read these type of books. He even laughed at a few parts of the book
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I LOVE this show !!!  Cast is really good & each show reveals a little more of the mystery. It really keeps you guessing.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|It seemed to drag on with so much detail. I bought it so that I could get an idea of the storyline before I went to the Movie. I got bored with it & didn't finish it
B00BSOC4HO|5.0|A great movie when it first came out and has stood the test of time. What I wouldn't give to see a sequel to this great movie.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC is my main soucrce of information for world news, but it also contains very accurate and objective information for Latin America in general. Anyone seeking to keep up to date should get this product.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead, and I waited in anticipation for the next episode to watch. now i only have to wait for the next season to start. cant wait.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|THE product has no clear instructions, and I can not install it on my kindle fire. If anyone has recommendations I would very much appreciate it since LINKED IN is a great tool.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very entertaining, full of action. Made me laugh, made me cry, and the visuals were absolutely gorgeous! This is an incredible story, I fell in love with the book when I read it. I am always worried that movies will ruin the book experience, but this one did not. It didn't let me down!
0307269752|5.0|A great thriller with that refreshing feeling that comes from reading fiction from a non-AngloAmerican author.  The hero is a newsman.  The storyline is convoluted, rife with history, thick with scandals.  Sexuality isn't cloaked by the puritanical preferences of American audiences, and there is disturbing brutality.  The unusual characters and sexuality (and buzz from all that) are likely why this story has proven to be so popular.  I won't recap the plot like many reviews here have, but suffice it to say I found it riveting.<br /><br />If you can't get enough, there's both sequels and movie adaptions (more than one version) of this story.  The subtitled older movie take is the one I prefer.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004X4R49Y|3.0|It's worth watching but I'm glad I did not go to the theater to see it.  Good insight into Queen Elizabeth's family and I always thought that George VI was underrated and eclipsed by his daughter and this brought him back into the public.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Let me go right on record up front:  I have seen the original EVIL DEAD, but it's been 20 years.  I remember very little about it.  Therefore, I went to the remake with few memories to compare to, so my response to the current EVIL DEAD is pretty much just for the current movie.  I can offer no comparisons, no pros & cons vs. the original (or even to EVIL DEAD 2, which I haven't seen in ages either).<br /><br />That said, EVIL DEAD is a pretty good movie...if you're in the mood for the kind of movie it is.  It's quite gory, features generally unpleasant people doing pretty stupid things and is very simplistic.  These are its faults, but also its virtues (for the most part...I still object to the characters being unlikable).  If you want to shut off the mind and even the heart, and let your gut enjoy a film...EVIL DEAD may suit the bill.<br /><br />Some young adults meet at a cabin, because one of their number (Mia) wants to go cold turkey from drugs, and her friends (and brother) have agreed to help.  It's never explained why professional help wasn't sought, but that is sort of covered because one of the \\"team\\" is a nurse.  A nurse who would be in all sorts of ethical trouble...but a nurse.  It's a dumb setup that actually helps the plot, because when Mia becomes possessed by an evil entity, her friends temporarily chalk her odd behavior up to withdrawals.<br /><br />But before long, all hell breaks loose and these fine folks begin to do terrible things to each other's bodies.  The movie does NOT stoop to the torture porn of movies like HOSTEL though...it sticks with horror movie trappings.  People see weird things in mirrors.  Spells are cast.  The \\"dead\\" come back to life.  It's all a big, goopy, messy, loud and bloody (VERY bloody) fun-fest.  Everyone will find at least one very cringe-worthy scene...you'll have your choice.  Depending on which thing gives you the most willies, you can cringe at burnings, drowning, electric knives, nail guns, chainsaws and more.For me, the nail gun scene was particularly painful to watch.  When one of the characters begins firing on two others...the sound effects, the editing, the howls of pain and the practical special effects combined to make me actively squirm in my seat.  That hardly sounds pleasant, yet most of us know that sometimes, this sort of sick tension, followed by the release of leaving the theater intact is just what the nervous system ordered!<br /><br />I realize I haven't told you much about the plot...but really, that's hardly important.  You get the idea...Mia becomes possessed and does some pretty awful things which slowly spreads her \\"sickness\\" to her pals.  Will anyone make it to the end?  How horribly will the doomed come to their ends?  What level of horrible thing will the survivors have to do to stay alive?  That's about it.<br /><br />If you saw CABIN IN THE WOODS last year, the genre of \\"kids stuck in an old cabin\\" got turned on its head quite effectively.  EVIL DEAD reclaims this territory from the oblivion of Joss Whedon's gentle mockery.<br /><br />But the movie only gets 3.5 stars from me, because I can't completely forgive a movie with quite so many character mistakes.  The thing that bugged me most was the fact that although at least some of these characters apparently had come to this cabin many times in years past...no one knew there was a trap door and a cellar.  And when they discover the disgusting and disturbing things IN that cellar...no one suggests \\"let's get the hell out of here and call the cops.\\"  One of the guys just gets a big plastic trash bag and starts cleaning up.  I'm sorry...I don't buy it.  Later, even with the bridge washed out so no one can drive away...why would you return to the cabin where all hell has been unleashed.  Stay in your darn, sheltered car, far away from where the death and destruction is.  Oh well...these stupid actions don't exactly spoil the movie, but I can't put it 5 star territory either.  The cast of EVIL DEADis competent, but these characters are so cardboard that I don't see how anyone could have exactly given an award-winning performance.<br /><br />On the other hand, the gory (and most non-CGI enhanced) special effects are very good.  I conclude my review with that observation, because once again...only see this movie if graphic, gory effects are what you're in the mood for.
1449410243|5.0|I bought this for myself for Christmas (we have four (4) cats and have to keep an eye on them!) and love most everything from Matt Inman.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Hollywood did it again, put there spin  on this, and not a good job at that!!Best just read what you can about this man that history has provided!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|If you are a fan of the movie ONCE, you will not regret buying the soundtrack.  It literally will help you replay scenes from the film.
B000FC146C|5.0|I've read The Thorn Birds before, probably 25 years ago.  I loved it every bit as much this time, rediscovering the characters, and nuances of the story.  This is Colleen McCullough's masterpiece.  Well written descriptive, captivating.  The characters pop out of the pages & their lives are filled with joys, tragedies & complex relationships.  An excellent read!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Putting Corey and Brenner together was such a good idea.  Their characters fit well together, obviously.<br />Perhaps it's simply because I don't want the story to end but I found that the final chapters lacked the depth and detail given to the beginning.  The objective reached; the book ends.  Wow. Way too short!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|So glad we now have the technology to view better TV.  After years of being stuck with major network garbage we hooked up for internet access to some of these great shows.  This one is super!
B009KEN87O|5.0|beat all the levels on easy, then went back and played the normal levels and now the hard levels are kicking my butt, but for some reason i can't stop playing.  apparently i like it so much i put it on my wife's ten inch tablet and i'm starting all over again ... bigger screen is way better.
B001JNND9W|5.0|Saw it when it first came out.... and glad I can own it now! Decent acting and awesome driving stunts.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|fun game, couldn't put it down the first day.  was even better on my wife's ten inch tablet because of the bigger screen size.  kids love it too, fun to play.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is fun... and a little bit addicting.  It is a fun game with lots of ways to change it up.  My only suggestion would be they creators need to make different locations or surroundings to select or work up to.  Other than that... it's great!  My kids like it too.
B00846WWVM|5.0|my wife got bored with it after a couple of days.  my kids and i are still playing it, but it's interesting.  it's fun to play and some of the levels are getting quite challenging.
B0000714BP|4.0|A unique role change for each of these classic actors! Rest in Peace Swayze, we miss you now and forever.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|it was memorizing for for days, and as cool and pretty as it is, it gets old after a while.  fun game though, would recommend it.
B006TTC54A|5.0|It may be just personal bias, but there is not a better movie than this one! The cast rules, as well as the music!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|i played for about 2 minutes, but what i will say is that all my kids loved it and played it and played it for hours.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was a true American hero and the book is a very entertaining description of the man and what he encountered in The Sandbox.  His tragic murder - while he was trying to help a fellow vet with PTSD - is deeply mourned here in Texas.  There are guys who act like heroes, and then there are guys who live like heroes; Chris Kyle was the latter.  RIP, sir, and thank you for sharing your story.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee's endurance, bravery, constitution are hard to imagine in such a young person.  Her story was very difficult to read but her ability to overcome makes it worth it.  What an amazing woman!!
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|This was recommended to me by a guy who served as a door gunner on a 'slick' and then on a gunship.  It is an amazing inside view of real helicopter operations during Vietnam.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Though I have an opinion about the rage/abuse? I still loved this book. I might have to read it again
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This series was very different from most books that I've encountered, and yet the characters quickly get under your skin and become very real.  I only wish the series had gone on for 10 more books!<br /><br />I must warn that there are serious plot twists that will keep you reading chapter after chapter!  Amazing characters!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Haven't used this app very much yet, but so far I like it. Figuring measurements & % values is good to have at finger tips. Good App.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|If memory serves, the fact that this is one of the inspirations for the mini-series &#34;The Pacific&#34; is in the book description.  This is a terrific view of the war in the Pacific from a guy who spent a lot of time deep in the war.  It's not a gun-ho bragging piece, but rather a real description of the hardships involved and how it changed Sledge's life.  You get to see not only a guy who came out of the war with (pretty obvious) PTSD, but how that evolved.  These were tough men who fought the enemy and their personal demons.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When season 3 ended, I was left, as usual with more questions than answers but I wasn't left unsatisfied.  I hate when a series ends on a cliffhanger, and if it did so when the wait for the next one was from March to October, it would be even worse.  The Walking Dead does a good job in making sure that there's enough resolution that you're not feeling you're one foot in the air for seven months.<br /><br />Now, on to the season itself.  Where season 1 was the set-up season, introducing us to both the people and the world they inhabit, and season 2 was the 'learning' season, giving us more than names to the characters, season three was where we settle in for the real story.  We know the group.  We know their wants, their fears, their motivations.  When we're introduced to a new group, we have the pleasure of learning these things about new people.  Are they what they seem?  If season 3 had a single binding idea, it is this.  &#34;What you see is not always what is real.&#34;
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series was very different from most books that I've encountered, and yet the characters quickly get under your skin and become very real.  I only wish the series had gone on for 10 more books!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've been trying to find a good way to keep up with my favorite websites, blogs and webcomics and this is it. It even organizes them across all my devices! I love this thing.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I am so happy to be able to get this at a great price! I might not have considered buying the set if had not been for the great prices. It came quickly and just as described. I am buying the whole set!
0345525558|4.0|For a first novel it was great;  written well but  contrived in parts with unrealistic web of thought fantasy within  This  brings out great discussion.  Recommend for readers who want something easy reading and  would like to read her next novel!  Get Flower dictionary as package for gift items.  Different cover jackets in papaerbvook got mine from England with different cover.  Like them all.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This CD is priceless .these lassu music will never die.. Yes I am a CD person I love my CDs<br />Love to look at my collections ( and I have an amazinig one..) nothing against the downloading
1451613512|4.0|For a gift and came on time.  New condition new publication  Not read it, but for interested people who look for embellishment in unrecorded history.  Cover is a catch all of content..
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I thought that this book was a great read. For being an intellectual person like myself, I very much enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn something new.
B009FZFONO|5.0|For some reason my TiVo didn't record one of the episodes in the season, and since I didn't want to watch the next episode without viewing this one I rented it.  I can't seem to remember which episode it was (I blame pregnancy brain), but it was one of the earlier ones from season 3.  I enjoyed it, as I have most of the episodes.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I can't say much about this movie, because me and my hubby fell asleep watching it. But, what little we did watch was good.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good.  I don't think it compares with the original Alien, but not much does.  The acting wasn't too bad, and Charlize Theron is always a delight to see in action.  It was good rental; I wouldn't buy it because I wouldn't watch it again unless I had absolutely nothing else to watch (which happened during a recent hotel stay; there was nothing on TV except this on HBO so I watched it again).  The plot was a bit thin, but the effects were good and I had a few &#34;Oh&#34; moments.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Excellent picture, direction and performances. Every detail count in this continuous flowing of well done scenes, action and suspense, with the eccentricity of a millionaire that has the means and intelligence to acquire what he wants.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Read a good book first like Lincoln from author OReilly.  You have to know your history before getting anything from the movie.  My husband was lost and I had to fill in the gaps to help him understand the characters and what and why was going on.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Exciting page turner.  Child explains Reachers thoughts on the upcoming events and still creates an exciting story that keeps you turning the pages.  You hate to see it end.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Wreck-it-Ralph is about the world of video games. After the lights go out and the arcade is emptied, the characters come alive. Ralph, a bad guy from the game \\"Fix-it-Felix Jr.\\", is sick of being treating like a criminal. Just because his job requires him to be a bad guy, doesn't mean he really is one, right? Come with Ralph on an adventure of a lifetime as he tries to prove that everyone has a little good in them. Can he show that it's okay to be himself?<br />I pre-ordered this movie and never regretted it. It's my favorite of all time. It shows the true meaning of friendship (as Ralph teams up with a little girl from the game \\"Sugar Rush\\"), and, unlike too many children movies, it doesn't focus on romantic love. If you were a gamer in the 80s or love old video games, keep an eye out; there's references everywhere, from the characters to writing on the wall. Overall, it's clean, funny, and family-friendly. A must-see.
030746363X|5.0|Excellent book! My boyfriend lost about 50 lbs over the course of 4 months! I lost 10 lbs in the first 2 months (and I have a petite frame, so that was perfect)! Excellent recipe ideas too. Thank you Tim!!!
B003XYERRM|4.0|It was wall written, held my interest.  The romance and story about an historical event  was entertaining.  Was hard to lay aside at bedtime.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|Starting to get if figured out. Love the fact that I can check on my pages using my Kindle when I&#34;m on the go.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Filthy!Filthy!Filthy!  I wanted to get hold of her  for being so dumb and greedy!, him for his callous, selfish,un-concern for anything other than his sick desires!
B00065MDRW|5.0|After listening to this album for about 35 years, during which time I fell in love with the inventiveness of the music, the alternating hard and soft styles, the psychedelic lyrics, and later grew tired of all those things and came to see the whole thing was messy and over-rated I can now confidently rate this a keeper.<br /><br />What really stands out so many years later is the proficiency of this jazz-rock-symphonic ensemble. The drums are so exact, the guitar so raw. The only sound here that is arguably dated is the Mellotron which is overly used, but that's quibbling. All the tracks are classics, including the ridiculously slow and exorbitant Moonchild.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Wonderful read for those who like murder mysteries.This is the first book I have read from this author and I just couldn't put it down.It was so cleverly crafted that  I had no idea even  in the last few pages how it was going to  turn out .The main characters take it in turns to give their account of events right through the book  which was an effective technique in leading the reader up many dead ends.Enjoy
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Worth the 99 cents to avoid all the pesky ads of the free one.  Has a couple of nice attributes including little &#34;awards&#34; for reaching certain goals.  Kinda of fun.
B002WJI63A|5.0|Cute plush doll, well made, now my niece can participate with her big brother's playtime with his Mario brothers plush collection.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|The author brought you right into the story and his characters we believeable.  Introduced you to the character George Smiley who later becomes more prominent in his stories.  Big fan on LeCarre's writings.
B0000024YL|5.0|I purchased this CD because I loved the original LP when I was younger.  Great harmony and wonderful songs from a great period in my life.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|While I do not agree with Ang Lee as Best Director, I do give him credit for a creating some incredible vision effects. The story involving the boy and the tiger was gripping at all times.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|Simple but elegant.  Easy to adjust the band.  Very comfortable and easy to read the dial. This is the 2nd one I have purchased like this.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This movie so good that I find it hard to find enough positive words to describe it. I was stunned with its intelligence and emotional depth. It should have won the best picture Oscar because I feel that it will become one of the best films ever made
B00425S1H8|5.0|The item worked great after contacting customer service. They were very helpful and solved my problem when the inital setup did not work.
B00597A6NU|5.0|My kind of movie! Mix history, flying, tense action, and an excellent ensemble cast, and you can't go wrong. Top notch!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun game. Challenging . I wish there was a break after so many yards.of playing. It is non stop until you die. Then you just start again.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|on ocassion it does sshow some lag, or there seems to be issues with the app it self, but when it does work, it is a great app,, its intuitive, and easy to use, and understand
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is just the best show, love the dynamics of the two groups and how they work together. It's a hoot.
B002OKXN9O|5.0|8 year old daughter and I love this movie and watch it over and over, which we have done with this movie for years!!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm a gamer, and this mouse has been absolutely exceptional. Easy to use software, configurable button binds, comfortable grip, precise reaction to movement. Can't really ask for much more.
B009R659L8|2.0|Words missing --different word style every page.  Nesds another corrected download.  We were looking forward so much to getting this and then we got a messed up download,  Just found one entire page missing.  Download a disaster,  Just about ready to return for credit and maybe order again
0060594896|5.0|A very huge book depicting the state of the art on self help. This book seems the good starting point for anyone is seeking a personal success
B004742Y68|5.0|I remember watching poltergeist when I was a kid.  I loved it.  I showed it to my kids the other night, and they liked if as much as I did.  My son was scared for a bit, but the next day he had his hands up to the tv and said \\"they're here\\" !
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I knew it was a game of a type I like to play; however, I don't know why, but I just don't care for it as much as some of the others.  It is one that you click on a group of 3 or more of the same colors and they go away and the others fall down into place.  Sorry to say, but I will be deleting this off my Kindle Fire so I can have room for other books and games.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I highly recommend this book! I learned so much about the German side in WWII, but I also learned a wonderful lesson in chivalry, nobility, and integrity, especially under the most difficult and trying of circumstances.<br /><br />If you only have time for one book, read this one!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I really like this game.  It has a few different ways of playing it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've gone about as far as I can go on the various ways of playing it and wish there were more levels or other ways of playing.  Since I've reached the top level, don't get to play it anymore.  I will probably delete it from my Kindle Fire so I'll have room for other games and books.  No use letting it just sit there and take up space.  It was fun while it lasted! :0)
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love this show! I never stop laughing! This is the funniest show and I love when they run the marathon's on Tv. I wasn't able to watch one night so I purchased this episode.  The only thing I didn't like is it is not free as part of prime membership.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Too many like this like that or else...quit filling my new feed with garbage! The app itself works perfectly...no gliches. ♡Amazon.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|He has a classic style of writing which builds and builds. He knows how to bring you in slowly and then you can't put the book down.
B001G70M6S|5.0|this film continues to deliver, and is one of my favorite formats to work with while taking dirty arty pictures.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Although not a great fan of musicals, when I first saw it in the movies I was enthralled and pre-ordered the DVD. Have not been disappointed. Although I do not believe that High Jackman or Russel Crowe are great singers, it does not detract from the depiction of Victor Hugo's classic
B005DJREGQ|5.0|this is one of her first shows that Ashley is the star in and its good to see her preform...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Dorothy was my number one hero as a little girl (when I watched the movie version taped on VHS off of TV). I also had a beautiful, pen-and-ink illustrated version of the book, and my parents would do read aloud at night, mostly out of order, starting at whatever chapter we picked, because we all knew the story backwards and forwards.<br /><br />All these years later, I downloaded the free kindle version to my iPhone. I read it when I'm waiting for the bus.<br /><br />Dorothy still holds up; the writing style is simple but compelling; the imagination that allowed Baum to come up with totally original characters unparalleled.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good action, kept me interested, great writing by the author, didn't read the first book so this one filled in any gaps that was not in movie.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I've enjoyed all the movie versions of Jane Austen's book Pride and Prejudice for years. This is probably my favorite series. What appeals to me the most are the good manners displayed by all during the period portrayed, the love,care and respect the sisters have for each other, in particular, and a world they all live in free from crime as we know it. The cast is excellent.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Starting with &#34;Orbits&#34; Shorter lets one know , &#34;This isn&#34;t the same Wayne Shorter from the Miles days.&#34; The quartet heard hear is freer, to the point of being &#34;avant-garde.&#34;  Some of the flourishes Shorter makes are mind-bending and downright amazing.  The title itself tells it all, for this group is indded playing Without a Net, there are times one says, &#34;How do they get out of this?&#34; Then hearing the intricate routes taken to bring them back to square one was an exercise in musical prowess. I had never heard Shorter so masterful in his explorations.
0385537689|5.0|I honestly did not really like the first book, but the second book was way better. Amazing romance and drama! Christian is so lovable and HOT! I would definitley recommend even if you did not like the first one!
B001BANK32|4.0|If you like being scared then read this book. I still like the Kubrick movie better, but this is worth the read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Loads seamlessly and has no issues or glitches that I can see. I’m happy with it, plus it’s free so :)
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Love it!  the character is not out of reach and could reflect on me from time to time.  needless to say, it's a love story
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I would recommend these books to young adults and adults of all ages. If you like fantasy/sci fi, action with a dash of romance then you'll enjoy this great read. I immensely enjoyed the characters. Collins did well in her description of each, painting a vivid picture. The concept of a world that no longer resembles the one we know, where the rich are rich and the poor are poor (ok that part is like now), where games to the death are the rich people's thrill, where there is absolute dictatorship, where technology has hugely advanced, this is a must read.
B007S3S8HO|2.0|The quality of the toy is good, the colors and design but for a 7 years old is difficult to understand the instructions to assembly this 176 pieces toy, soon he forgot a bought the toy and the pieces now are lost somewhere in his bedroom never ask for this toy again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I very much enjoyed this program.  I wish I could see the rest of them up to date.  I believe it would be season 3.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I got hooked to Downton Abbey on Netflix so I didn't have much choice but to buy it from you.  It is  much too expensive considering I could have it checked out at my local library.  But I love the series.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|also. the movie keep pausing every five minutes. I don't even want to pay for it. At first, I was so excited that I wad able to order Lincoln on Amazon, but was so disappointed.

B00BWJARHO|4.0|I would recommend this movie.  The story line is wonderful and the characters are believable.  I like how it tries all of the Hobbit movies together.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this app. I have both Temple Run games and love both.  Great Job Imangi Studios! Keep up the great work.  Can't wait for more sequels!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is my everything app. I even use it with my gardening projects. It's been handy making notes for all kinds of projects, including the aquaponic system I've been working on.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|I guess Casino Royale was a difficult act to follow scriptwise. The chemistry between Vesper and Bond worked wonders for that movie, something which this movie lacks. Don't get me wrong - the action sequences are fantastic, but storywise, Quantum of Solace is a bit hollow.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|I love William Joyce's work in The Fabulous Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore.  I wanted to see this BECAUSE of that.  I was so disappointed.  Santa... given an accent... I guess to be worldly but a bit too heavy for someone who is to be jolly.  I loved Jack Frost and the tooth fairy... Easter Bunny.... nope... not what he should have been... I think the characters had a bit too much darkness to them.  There seemed to be only one bad guy if you looked at the story.  But if you listened to the characters, their personas and size... of the Easter Bunny... just held too much heaviness inside to be loving.<br /><br />Maybe the combination of Joyce and his partner in this... took Joyce to the other side... more like something... that should have been made .... maybe with Neil Gaimon or ... Tim Burton.<br /><br />Not what I expected or wanted.  )-:
B0036TGSR6|4.0|The Ghost Writer will likely be remembered in the years to come as the film that director Roman Polanski was working on when he became embroiled in an extradition controversy whose roots were decades in the past. That fact seems rather sad when one looks at the film itself. Based on Robert Harris' bestselling novel The Ghost, The Ghost Writer deals with recent events by crafting a remarkable thriller around them.<br /><br />The film features a fine cast. Ewan McGregor plays the eponymous and unnamed lead character who is hired to help ghostwrite the memoirs of a former UK prime minister after the previous writer dies in mysterious circumstances. McGregor's performance is the heart and soul of the film as you can count on one hand the number of scenes he isn't in. Thankfully McGregor is utterly believable as a man who increasingly finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into an increasingly dangerous world until the very last scene. On the other side of the equation is Pierce Brosnan as former UK Prime Minister Adam Lang, who in the original novel was modeled on Tony Blair. While there are definitely echoes (if not downright ghosts) of Blair's time as PM in the plot, Brosnan's performance is anything but that of the man himself. Brosnan's Lang is a seasoned politician who while writing his memoirs finds himself caught up in the midst of a legal battle over potential war crimes that threatens to undo his legacy. From moments of lightness to serious moments like a conversation between McGregor's Ghostwriter and Lang on the latter's private jet, Brosnan gives perhaps the best performance of his career to date.<br /><br />As fine as their performances are though, McGregor and Brosnan are just part of a larger cast. Leading the supporting cast are Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang and Kim Cattrall as Lang's aide Amelia Bly, two women who seem to be at loggerheads for Lang's attention. Williams gives a fine performance as Ruth that leaves the audience thinking one thing before the final scenes change everything while the performance from Cattrail is adequate but perhaps not much else. The rest of the supporting cast includes good performances including Jon Bernthal as the Ghost's agent, Robert Pugh as former UK Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart, Timothy Hutton as Lang's lawyer and a rare dramatic turn from Jim Belushi as the memoirs publisher. There's also a nice, short appearances from Eli Wallach and Tom Wilkinson in small but pivotal roles. As a result the film is nicely acted by all concerned.<br /><br />Much of the atmosphere and tension of the film comes from its production values. The story unfolds in a rather dark world ranging from overcast, rain and darkness featuring heavily in the cinematography of Pawel Edelman to the grays and muted colors apparent in Albrecht Konrad's production design and Dinah Collin's costumes. As a result there is a constant sense of menace about no matter if its the publishers in London or the modern house where the memoir is being prepared in Martha's Vineyard. Director Roman Polanski lets the film unfold at its own pace which might come across as slow to those accustomed to the fast pace of most films being released today but the result is that the viewer is allowed to connect the dots along with McGregor's character. Sadly the biggest mis-fire of the production values, if not the entire film, is the score from composer Alexandre Desplat which doesn't seem well suited to the world of film and in fact undermines rather then helps the tension through the film. Overall though the production values and direction add immensely to the film as a whole.<br /><br />At the heart of it all is the script of course. Adapted from Robert Harris' bestselling novel The Ghost by Harris and Polanski, the film is a thriller set around recent controversial events. Those being so-called CIA torture flights, the war in Iraq and the disturbing connections between corporations involved in the defense industry and major governments. To do all this convincingly there is the memoir of former PM Lang of course and the tale of a ghostwriter who, knowing nothing about most of this, finds himself becoming increasingly deeper and deeper into it when Lang is accused of war crimes. Yet just as the viewer is led to believe that they've worked it all out, the final scenes of the film turn that very notion on its head with a twist that is truly out of left field. As with the novel, the film takes much of its basis out of reality and that makes the ending all the more shocking if not downright worrying with its potential real world implications. The result is a blueprint that is fascinating to watch and filled with tension.<br /><br />The Ghost Writer is a thriller and a fine one at that. From the acting of lead actors McGregor and Brosnan to the supporting cast to the production values and script, it is a film that unfolds in a world of constant gray and overcast where nothing, even when you think you've figured it all out, is what it seems. Though the film will almost certainly be overshadowed by the behind the scenes legal issues that surrounded it, it should also be remembered for being what it is: a disturbing thriller for our time.ments.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The opening scene of the movie, in which a small group of adoring Union soldiers reverently recite passages from the Gettysburg Address to Abe Lincoln, almost jinxed \\"Lincoln\\" for me. I thought: Oh no! Not another hokey, cornball Spielberg production (\\"War Horse,\\" \\"The Pacific,\\" \\"Saving Private Ryan\\").<br /><br />Fortunately Spielberg's buffoonish sentimental gesture was the last. Once Tony Kushner's script kicks into high gear things really begin to move forward and the narrative of the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment proceeds to a satisfying climax. Along the way we learn a good deal about the personal Lincoln we might not have known, and about legislative processes of the Civil War Congress. Little has changed: money and influence peddling ruled the Capital. That said, the art of political oratory in those days was superior to today's Congressional flannel-mouths (Lincoln wasn't the only practitioner of soaring political rhetoric). And thanks to his collaboration with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Tony Kushner's grasp of the historical details of the American legislative process was commanding.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis's character study of Lincoln was a revelation: imaginative, compelling and nuanced. There wasn't a moment when I didn't feel I was in the presence of Lincoln. Was it a bit of a sacrilege to cast a Brit as America's greatest president? Well, not exactly. The English have always participated in our political dramas: if it hadn't been for the intervention of an Englishman, the Liberty Bell would have been melted down for candleholders.<br /><br />I mentioned that the first scene was the only instance of Spielberg's signature sentimentality, but there was another exhibit at the end, just as Lincoln dies, and the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton intones with all the subtlety of a grade school play, \\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\" There is some question as to whether Stanton actually uttered these words at the time, or whether they were added to the Lincoln myth as an afterthought; in any event, if Spielberg felt the need to use such a quote, it should not have been so prominently showcased, but a subdued thread in the fabric of the scene.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Nothing better than a Harry Bosch novel.  Harry keeps at the one thing in his life he can do well--solve murders.  This is NOT fluff reading and keeps you guessing.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a highly inspirational book to read.  It definitely gives a voice to those who are \\"introverts\\" regardless of the definition or how a person defines it which is different person to person.  It even talks about those introverts who are more so \\"psuedo- extraverts\\" such as myself.<br /><br />It talks about the past and present roles of the \\"extravert - introvert\\", in other cultures, how it inter relates at home, school and work.  It is well researched in various ways ranging from interviews, scientific perspectives, and personal experiences (by the authors and others) and boils it down to a simple read that anyone could delve into and enjoy.<br /><br />It is definitely a well developed book and should be read.  Introverts need to find those moments where they can be outgoing at those times and places being \\"gregarious\\" every so often and have their \\"restorative niches\\" and extraverts need to find it's not always best to rush into things, sociability isn't always best and that taking the step back can be needed.  In other words, each personality types can learn from each other and that neither is better nor worse than the other.  Both are great.<br /><br />As for the book, it is a highly recommended read.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would give it 10 stars out of the available 5 stars.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This film should definitely be rated PG-13.  There is actually a scene where a little boy dives into a woman's over the top cleavage to retrieve a key.  Some of the more subtle messages of the film are questionable for Christians.  Definitely a film to watch before showing it to any kids (even older ones).  The animation and music, however, are lovely.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Just more of the same from the best series currently on TV.<br /><br />Great sitcom with likeable characters!  Highly recommended purchase.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautiful scenery and a plot that keeps you thinking after the show ends.  We will have to watch season three on live television.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love it challenges mind keeps you thinking great exercise. Jjj :/ :-) huffy huffy bed hub bed huffy the same one letter to bed
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series is amazing! Season 2 is fantastic. I watched all of the episodes in a matter of a few days! I love all the characters. Would highly recommend to everyone!
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Loved this movie! Entertaining, funny, endearing.  This was a great movie and well done. Great date night with my husband.
0061122416|5.0|I WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND TO OURCHASE THIS BOOK AND IT IS  A MUST READ. I JUST GOT IT TODAY, AND I CAN NOT WAIT TO READ IT. THE CONDITION OF THE BOOK WAS EXCELLENT. BRAND NEW AS I ORDERED!
030746363X|5.0|I have been continually reading this book for about 9 months now. Started with the diet, moved on to supplementation, then to endurance. This book really has something for everybody. No lie, Tim's book changed my life encouraging me through diet and exercise. I lost 45 pounds in about 3 months. In short, if you take the appropriate steps it can do the same for you. On top of all that it has got me interested in all sorts of different types of sports nutrition / medicine / theory. Cool book and I recommend to anyone looking to better yourself physically and or mentally.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|For all the Enterprise haters in the ST world, remember that the original series was technically a flop and pretty much panned by everyone when it was first aired.<br /><br />The first time I watched Enterprise (a couple of years after it had originally aired) I went in with very low expectations.<br /><br />I was very surprised how well done the show was overall, from the cast to production values, etc.<br /><br />Of course there were the odds and ends that I personally didn't care for but overall I found Enterprise to be the best Trek series overall.<br /><br />Extra kudos to Amazon for offering it through Prime for free streaming.  I just purchased the Blu-Ray for Season 1 and to be honest I don't think the quality is that much better than the Amazon HD stream.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I loved the scenery, the morphing, the way the family stayed together and supported one another.  And the ending - WOW! - I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it - but it was worth waiting all these months for.
0756686970|4.0|My 5-year-old sleeps with this book under his pillow.  However, before purchasing you should realize that while this book might be extremely appealing for children who love Legos and Star Wars (or specifically Lego Star Wars), it actually seems to be more for hard-core &#34;grown-up&#34; Lego Collectors. Some of the mini-figures or sets (that your kid might ask for as a Christmas present, for example) are no longer available and might cost thousands of dollars on E-bay. Still grows my sons imagination and brings alive this world. Instead of reading stories he wants me to read from this book.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It took a little while to load, but once it did- it did not disappoint. Great acting, great story, and great ending. The book is great, but if you don't have a couple days to read it, this is a great alternative.
B005VPRETE|4.0|While I might wish there was a world that didn't include &#34;Girl&#34; Legos and &#34;Boy&#34; Legos, this controversial &#34;Friends&#34; series has provided a gateway for the world of Legos for my daughter.  She is near 3 and needed a Lego offering that she knew was just for her and not her older brothers. After receiving this as a special present and interacting with it, I could see she was more interested in the larger Lego bin and doing more free-form construction.<br /><br />But, I do not like that the Lego mini-figure girls in this series are &#34;skinny&#34; and not just regular chunky mini-figures.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I like historical movies like this one, that have a real story, with some really funny things in it. Brilliant!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The story line is always evolving and changing direction. I think this a critical difference between it and other shows. There's enough conflict resolution in each episode to keep me feeling like something significant was accomplished; and yet there's always something greater left undone that moves the audience through the season.<br /><br />The greatest issue I have is the use of Go_ Damn (GD) in the script. I can handle offensive language. I have some phrases of my own that I reserve for one or two people. However, we all have our limits.<br /><br />I love this show. It's rare that I find a show in which the male roles are acceptably strong and appropriate. Jessica & Donna are a fantastic balance of strength and femininity. The men are heroic & complex as their heroism is often misjudged as callous.<br />In spite of how much I love the show, the use of GD hurts my religious nature to the point where I'm about to turn it off. I know I'm only one person and my opinion is insignificant...but I would be very grateful if the use of GD was eliminated. It's more of challenge to write something just as powerful but not linguistically offensive.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The parallelism that the author utilizes flows naturally.  As a reader, you are put through the same feelings that Victoria had. You can feel her anger and then the consolation.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|This is an outstanding film. I'm an independent writer and director, and Mel Gibson knows how to make great films.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|Darkly romantic lyrics, epic instrumentals. Woodkid has a style all his own. It's hard to recommend him based on sound because it's so unique.. (maybe solo Thom Yorke). Definitely worth the purchase!
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've listened to in awhile. I love this, and I can't stop listening to it. Seriously, buy this album.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|Unlike other reviewers. I do not find this to be their best sounding album.<br />It is their first album that I have not outright bought...nor do I have any interest in buying it at all.<br /><br />Track by Track:<br />1.Fast in my car-Beginning instrumental sounds to techno but gradually works up to kind of rock-ish.Good for rocking out in the car.Sounds overall like ye olden days of rock-at least what they're trying for. Really sounds like Avril Lavigne-in her early pop days.Too repetitive.<br />2.Now-WORST song on the album-in my opinion.Granted the preview clip of hayley singing Now-ow-ow-ow was enough to rouse fans to excitement. BUT overall the song sound far too much like dubstep to even be considered likable-at least to me.<br />3. Grow up-Not typical Paramore but still likable.Once again overly repetitive.But for me personally...I could try getting used to it.BUT not an immediate favorite.Too Slow...I'm at 1:55 and struggling to keep my eyes open. Then again maybe I won't try this one on my ipod.<br />4.Daydreaming-Starts out too slow-my opinion.Sounds too much like \\"Grow up\\"same type of slow beginning,same beat.<br />5.Interlude:Moving on-Not caring for their Hawaiian beat in this. Short song. A shot at the Farrow brothers.Very Obviously so.Shame.Hayley you are very much not over it then,huh?<br />6.Ain't it fun-80s beat.Don't mind it.Kinda like the retro thing its got going.I can give this a test on my Ipod/Itunes.<br />7.Part 2-You know how Hayley was being all cryptic in the 4 nights,4 sides thing. Its part 2 of \\"Let the Flames begin\\". I am inclined to like it because part 1 could easily be called on of my favorite songs on AWKIF.But at the same time I'm wondering \\"were they running out of ideas and the album said write another one NOW\\". Its like finding out your favorite Disney movie is having a sequel forced upon it. Torn.Like it but don't like the idea of it.<br />8.Last Hope-Another depressing sounding song.Repetitive. Putting me to sleep.<br />9.Still Into You-I know many fans...did not like hearing this as the second single off this album.I am not one of them. Its a happy song. I like the happy,lovey dovey song.I really do. It sounds like the Paramore we know and love. I love how its cheeky like \\"That's What You Get\\". I just like it.<br />10.Anklebiters-Sounds like PARAMORE. Rather than paramore.Rocking out while listening to this.<br />Good message too. You shouldn't care what EVERYBODY thinks.Shortest song on the album. That ISN'T an interlude.<br />11.Interlude:Holiday-Too island-y again. Though, at least...I know someone who can play this on ukelele if they want. Seems simple enough.<br />12.Proof-They're BAAAAAAAAAACK. Well sort of. Another love song.<br />13.Hate to see your heart break-Sad song.slow song.<br />14.(One Of Those)Crazy Girls-Listened to the preview on Itunes....liked it. Listened to the full version...WTF???!!! Is that even Hayley singing. Or is the GUEST singer. More than just another guest singer. Are you guys auditioning a new female vocalist?<br />15.Interlude: I'm not angry anymore- Did you guys record half this album in Hawaii or something??? This is getting old.<br />16.Be Alone-Sexual innuendo song. Why would she wanna hang out with her friends??? When she could BE ALONE with you ;)Too repetitive.<br />17.Future-Semi-boring.slow song.<br /><br />Sorry about the lack of review content for 13 & 14. I'm listening on Youtube and WMG is starting to take all of the lyrics videos down.Probably trying to force us to buy the CD.<br /><br />I'm not a fair-weather fan if I don't love every song they put out. I'm sorry but people saying that is rather disrespectful. We're still fans,too.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book... The book is very well written and you never know what to expect.  In the beginning I was not sure what was going on, but I am so glad I kept reading because it was one of the best books i have ever read!
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I loved this movie, the content, dealing with mental health issues is never easy, but the cast has captured the essence of this dark and surprising movie.  What part of it is real? Which person has the problem? Its a mind bender!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I expected this to be mediocre at best, just another good-guy vs. bad-guy shoot-em-up chase story. Instead, Child has created a different kind of protagonist who uses his intelligence and military training as well as his own standards of morality. Reacher prefers to keep far out of the attention of authorities and media. He's not a superman only because he chooses not to be involved too closely with average people. Child writes well, probably as a result of his British education and uses his perspective as a British immigrant to the US with a fresh eye for our culture.
B000SW16NU|5.0|An ancient question, never gets its answer, but this movie is well done - what can be wrong with a Ridley Scott movie? Historically, fact and fiction mixed together, a lovely and heartbreaking love story. Beautiful music, beautiful people, and beautifully filmed.
B009KWL0YE|3.0|Not as good as I remember but still a classic, so I'm glad I have it for my collection. It moves a little slower than I remember, but there are a few scenes that are just priceless. It just takes a while to get to them. I received this DVD very quickly, no problems there.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Over the course of this series, it seems the writers incorporate conflict between the brothers simply for conflict's sake and it's as irritating as hell. For Sam to simply 'give up' on looking for Dean who accidentally ended up in Purgatory after killing the head leviathan), not even trying to find him, is simply unbelievable to me. However, that is the only thing I have against this season. (BTW, did we ever get a reason Sam left his girlfriend to end up at the cabin where Dean was hiding out after emerging from Purgatory? Did I miss something, or did the writers? Did he know Dean would be there, if so, how?) Anyway, the conflict between the brothers needs to end. it's been done to death, now they need to start building trust with each other, they need to start being the bantering brothers which is cool and comfortable, and Sam needs to lighten up a little, while at the same time Dean needs to (and is finally doing, I might add) realize his brother is growing up. The last few eps I've seen on Amazon Instant Video have and are building on this season's arc, and I'm very satisfied that the brothers are shaping up and finally becoming brothers... at the soul, not just by blood. The jury is out on what will happen in season 9, I'm watching closely, but from a distance. I've had the rug ripped out from under me a time or two as a result of curves being thrown at us from the writers and then not so unexpected curves, as though they take one step forward with Sam and then decide the conflict should take center stage and place him five steps back. Been there, done that, let's move on. Season 8 seems to be delivering here, but as I said above, I'm going to keep it at arm's length. I'm tired of being jerked around.  All i can say is, now that Sam has made his decision to stay with Dean, rather than pursue a 'normal' life, there's still traces of his longing for a normal life in the last two eps (18 and 19). Once again, he's falling back into an old and worn out routine. Enough. However, that being said, the fact that Sam is ailing from the completion of trials is enough to put Dean in protective mode and that is fine by me. it's great to see Dean wanting to look out for his younger brother with more feeling than I've felt in a long time. I just wish the writers would bring Sam full circle and quit having him be so indecisive. I don't know why they insist on playing the 'Sam wants a normal life' card throughout this series. If he really wanted that, he'd take off and get away from the hunting and fight to keep it that way. I'm sure there can be other conflicts within him that can be focused on. By doing this same old-same old routine, it proves the writers are lacking in vision or are not connected like they should be with Sam or Dean, for that matter, because Dean is always left being hurt by Sam's indecision. Ok, sorry for the rant, but there you are. I'm liking the last few eps, though. It's promising. Rug, stay where you are... right under my feet, thank you very much.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was one of the best seasons. I do have to say though that the season finale was a little weak.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Entertaining for young and old....  I play with my granddaughter, she gets really excited when she sees the different & colorful dragons hatch from their eggs.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|This should be a suitable film for most but there are a number of  problems which would influence its acceptability for certain groups. It does not have subtitles for the hearing impaired. Happily, this is made in the old-fashioned way, all the speaking is articulated and given the volume to be understood by anyone who is not in the more serious categories of hearing impairment. Still in all, no  DVD made in recent decades should have been deficient in this respect. For some in  the potential audience, who are extremely conservative (in a social not political sense), the language will, on occasion, be over the line of propriety. I do not think this is true for the larger segment of the public but these people should be aware of the problem so as to avoid, what to them, is an impropriety. One reviewer mentions some language bothersome to their religious sensibilities, I did not notice this, but potential watcher beware.<br />For myself, it was a movie that, as they say, kids of all ages, could enjoy (with that pleasure, of course, diminishing in inverse proportion to their  actual age). It is the theme of Pinocchio. Wizard of Oz, and who knows how many other classic stories, becoming human through  the induction of certain characteristics. The robotetry (after puppetry and similar words) was quite well done, the good guys (and gal) suitably nice, and the villains suitably villainous. While much is simple minded slapstick, physical and verbal, as the use of the Three Stooges clips remind the adults watching, this is what kids get a kick out of .<br />At any rate, with the exceptions I point out, this is a young peoples movie which allows the adult to sit in without an eyeshade and ear plugs.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|For a family movie it dragged horribly. We watched for about 20 min and shut it off. It may have eventually become more intriguing, but if I'm not curious in the first 30 min, it's not worth my time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's a perfectly good, if not overly challenging adventure game. Might be a bit short if you're a hard core adventure/hidden object fan.
0385535147|1.0|This is the worst book that John Grisham has written and I have read all of his books. There really isn't much to keep you interested. It took me 3 months to finish it. I thought \\"The Chamber\\" was bad but \\"The Racketeer\\" makes that one look good. I'm a big Grisham fan but this one just didn't do it for me.
B00005RHGL|5.0|The movie came right away, and it is great to have this movie with the director's comments.  Tombstone is a true classic, the very best.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|This album has many different styles in it, old school, raggae, pop. Overall its a good album. My favorite is Locked out of Heaven.
B005HS00V4|4.0|This is an excellent release , but not as Peter Gabriel's usual music.You hear his songs and covers with an orchestra.The big advantage is the soundtrack that you can only have on blu ray :DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I think this is a good read for late teens or early twenties.  It is a good story of working through loss of loved ones and conflicts in life.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|Not a bad film but I was not exspecting a film based on a video game. Of course I jumped into it with out reading what the film was about. It's still a family film though and I am sure kids will love it.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|Watched the movie first and enjoyed it so much I wanted to read the book... loved the book and getting more indepth with the characters... one of those &#34;can't put it down until it is finished&#34; reads!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I enjoyed this film as allways a story of coming of age is part of the film. With that being said, there are those parts which are halarious or at leased they were for me.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this kind of movie.  I watch them all of the time.  Wish I could find the book, because I love to read too.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I realy enjoyed this film. Anyone who loves special effects will appreciate it. Hence, I recomend it to those of us who love them.
B004H6G0TI|2.0|I like the game itself, but I have problems with it.  It keeps locking up and kicking me out. Not always in the same place. It seems I have less problems if I only use the 1st airplane.  It just gets agervating when you get into a good session and then boom it locks up.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|The writing was much better for this series, and the story line was a lot more interesting than parts of the last several series. Fewer alien monsters and more thought problems.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This is one of my favorite series, on par with &#34;The Lost Fleet&#34; series.  I recommend you pick it up and read it
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was well written.  I loved the surprises along the way.  The end was a disturbing; but something to think about.  One will not forget the book.
0312427565|5.0|\\"The Right Stuff\\" brings the dawn of the space age to the broadest of audiences. Written in a sharp, entertaining style, Wolfe combines the science and the drama of the Mercury program to create a book that you won't want to put down.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|It is a well written book that I would not chose to read again.  I will not read anymore of them in the series.  Evil wins and I chose for evil to not win.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Why did this movie get made?  Who in their right mind would spend money to produce it, and finally they could have only \\"improved\\" the casting by hiring Téa Leoni instead of Charlize Theron as the mentally ill main character walking through her role.  Don't waste your money, and more importantly don't waste you time!

Her name was Hailey. Now she's gone. And so am I.\\"<br />This is Doug's mantra. He is 29 years old. He had been married to Hailey for 2 years when she died in a plane crash. Hailey has been dead for a year now and Doug is trying to cope with himself, her house in suburban Westchester and her teenage son Russ, both of which he inherited. He is pretty much making a hash of things. He self-medicates: drinks a lot, smokes a little weed, eats nothing but frozen artery-clogging food and hides from friends and family.<br />Then one day his twin sister Claire arrives on his lawn and announces her plans to patch him up and push him out into the rest of his life. Doug reluctantly agrees to the plan.<br />What happens after this is usually hilarious and often bittersweet, involving<br />Russ, Doug's boss and job, his family, a few blind dates, a wedding and a shooting. But relax, the comedy is not irresponsible or disrespectful. Doug does not suddenly snap out of his depression but evolves realistically over the course of another year. This is a satisfying read. You don't have to work too hard but there's still plenty of substance. It will leave a smile on your face.[[ASIN:0385338910 How to Talk to a Widower: A Novel (Bantam Discovery)]]
B001EBYMB2|5.0|I Loved this story so much and enjoyed every bit of time i spent watching it. It deffinantley hit home:)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got totally absorbed in the complex characters and couldn't purchase the 2nd book fast enough. I've started re-reading the set now.  I was in such a hurry to find out what happened, I read them too quickly.  This time is even better.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|I am a big Duranie, so it can be a bit difficult to give an objective opinion but I really appreciated the sincerity of John's memories. He is so human and so simple in what he says about his experience in the band! I've admired his strenght in fighting for a better life for himself and for his family,<br />Another things is very remarkable -  in the whole book John has never judged anyone apart from himself. No bad opinions, no scandals, no rumours about anybody, especially about no one from the band.<br />Great, fantastic book! Great personality of the author!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This was a great gift for my grand kids for Easter. They have watched this more than 5 times already. They love this movie. And the eggs was a great add.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|I'm writing about the 3 book series.  Storylines with teens cutting and starving themselves to have mental clarity is just disturbing.  I think that the author could have gone in a different direction.  I am not a fan and although the overall concepts of the books is good I would hate for these books to gain popularity.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Some of the lines are predictable and cliche.  Te humor is entertainingand adds to character development. Loved the t-shirt \\"sleeping with genius\\" with arrow pointing at his head.
B004UPALT6|4.0|many movies from my childhood and teen years do not hold up over time. This is not one of them. The special effects are still wonderfully gory and over the top. Bruce Campbell is still perfect amount of humor and bravado this type of movie needs.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|I wasn't blown out of the water, but it was a very good movie.  The personalities of the characters are awesome - although Hugh Jackman's character can be quite annoying.  The animations are amazing, and the writers have an incredible imagination that was extremely impressive.  Definitely recommend.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I liked the book, it was like 3 books in one. Each segment was very interesting. Yes I would recommend this book to my friends. It was a well written book.
B0037VNX44|3.0|This movie helps to proves that there are problems all over the world with prisons and inmates.  It makes me glad that I have my freedom.  It also makes a person appreciate their sanity and sence of purpose in life.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|A lot of interesting content, well put together. I found this book informative and enjoyable and will be going back to re-examine some sections.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|John Hawkes was an amazing actor and Helen Hunt was fantastic. Completely underrated film that didn't get the attention it deserves.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Liked the play and the movie so much, I needed my own copy.  Pre ordered and it was on my door it was released to the public at a price that was better than in the stores.  Appreciate the &#34;extra&#34; footage.
057506885X|4.0|Having never read any of Pratchett's work due to the pre-assumption that his work would not be my `cup of tea', I felt that it was about time I tested this theory. I am pleased to say that despite taking the fantasy genre seriously I uncharacteristically felt compelled to discover his work, and was drawn to the bold cover of `The Last Hero: a Discworld fable'. I am still unsure of why Pratchett is quite so highly praised, as his writing seems to be more satirical than supernatural, but it does slot into the fantasy genre as something very distinctive and atypical...<br /><br />What I loved about this book were the rather peculiar full-color illustrations by Paul Kidby, which adds emphasis to the story's humor and mocking nature. The combination of outlandish images and otherworldly storyline makes this something truly magical, different and quite extraordinary hence I was astonished by how singular Terry Pratchett is. The innate hilarity in the characters is brought out through wonderful storytelling and Pratchett's vibrant style, with the true nature of bravery and the cruelty of growing old shining through.<br /><br />I felt a strong connection to Cohen, who demonstrated how even a `legend' or hero figure, can also be human. Courage is not without fear nor is heroism without flaws, and this tale certainly was as true to life as any realistic acute account of a courageous being. At first I found it slightly sardonic until you look beneath the obvious and see how the author is portraying the hero figure as someone whom readers can empathize or relate to. Pratchett is bold and brave by defying the norm and having a main protagonist as someone who is not perfect, not without imperfections and who is certainly not the young, strapping masculine savior that one might envisage.<br /><br />`Discworld 27' is an extraordinary journey full of meaningful connotation and heartwarming candidness. I do think that it may take a while for me to become used to this distinctive author and his singular flair, but I am glad that I did attempt to read his work (at last!). Beautifully blending myth and legend with world-building that is eccentric and quite bizarre, Terry Pratchett has created a niche for himself that doesn't slot into any particular genre; hence standing out as an astonishingly unique author with his own matchless style and vision.or and his singular flair, but I am glad that I did attempt to read his work (at last!).

B004H6G0TI|3.0|Fun game but it crashes pretty regularly on Kindle Fire. It's tough to make it through an entire &#34;stage&#34; without it crashing.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Much more classic bond than any Daniel Craig movie yet.  Action as good (almost) as Casino Royal, and much more bond-like.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoy the relationships and the characters. The only problem is length and dues ex mechina. The book is extremely long and even though I wanted to know what happened others might not. The other problem was characters randomly showing up when the kids had issues. In the end it was too much and I wanted the kids to actually have to do something. Instead it was done for them.
B00BX2QTWC|5.0|Where to start with this album? This wasn't my first exposure to Woodkid - I read about him on a trailer music website, and became hooked on the few youtube videos that were posted with some of his songs (especially loved the \\"Run Boy Run\\" track).<br /><br />I bought the MP3's because it took too long to wait for the CD (Which I own now - it was a shame the deluxe edition was sold out). My main reason for wanting the disc was so that I could play it in my car. Imagine my horror when I discovered that my car's cd-player could not handle the sheer epicness of the tracks offered. So, to those of you that own an older cd-player, this disc may not work inside that - but pretty much everything else should have no problem with the disc.<br /><br />As for my favorites, I cannot pick one.
1400067820|4.0|At the outset, I want to say that Taleb is a dynamic, contrarian thinker.  His previous books, especially The Black Swan, are among my favorites. It is precisely because I like The Black Swan (and to a lesser degree, \\"Fooled by Randomness\\") so much that I can't give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />Taleb positions this book as sort of the culmination of his previous works.  He is still an engaging writer, and his humor really shines through.  However, to me there's a bit of fatigue setting in - I know a lot of what he'll say before he says it.  Moreover, while professing to have little ego and tearing down bankers, lawyers, and so-called \\"fragalistas,\\" it's obvious he thinks quite highly of himself.  For example, he discusses his weight training regime in detail - it sort of fits in the book, but it really doesn't.<br /><br />Turning to the content of the book, well, it's a bit long, particularly if you've read Taleb's previous works.  I did find it to be an engaging work, but the ideas somehow seem less novel this time around.  There's less behavioral finance and more pontification, maybe.  Yes, there are ways to design systems to fail, and many of the world's financial systems certainly give a veneer of stability when they are inherently unstable.  But I got all that from his first two books.<br /><br />The truth is that governments like large systems with fewer actors because they are easier to regulate, and that's what governments do.  Corporations and other entities like fewer actors because their management incentives are often tied to growth/size.  Stating that there should be periodic, disruptive changes arguably flies in the face of human nature because humans tend to seek stability, or at least symmetry.<br /><br />This book is an entertaining read - it's not really useful for someone seeking investment advice, but it certainly is informative and contrarian.  I did like it, but it just wasn't as entertaining as The Black Swan.  Nonetheless, it's worth a read.
B00993G41S|5.0|Love the British wit and John Cleese.  Very funny movie.  I would highly recommend this movie to all who love comedy.

B00BSBT8M6|4.0|A beautiful film to look at. A great story, but a bit of a fantasy. I didn't read the book, but I hear it followed it well.<br />I'm glad I finally saw it - and thought Ang Lee did a great job of directing. Definatley worth renting for an enjoyable movie night.

B009T3AE1Y|1.0|I love Robert Pattinson don't get me wrong, but this movie was horrible! I certainly wasted my money on this DVD! Not cool!
0316044695|1.0|This book was recommended to me by someone I respect, but I can't figure out why. It's poorly written, long-winded, and, from what I understand through my own research, riddled with hyperbole. I don't doubt that Luttrell was an excellent soldier, but I'm not sure he's up to snuff as an author/storyteller. If you thought the Goosebumps books you read as a kid were classics, this may just be the book for you.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars continues to make amazing music! Loved this CD, but the only thing that I disliked is that it didn't have the Twilight Breaking Dawn &#34;It will Rain&#34; song. It should've been there!

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I enjoyed the first installment of the movie trilogy, and I am excited to see the remaining movies. I've read The Hobbit many times since I was a kid so I appreciate the challenge of translating that story into movies. The first movie was what I was hoping for, and with every viewing I am entertained and transported by the depth of details and the heart of the story.

The WHL LOVR character almost runs over some pigeons with her truck in a fit of rage over the whales being moved without her \\"getting so say goodbye!\\" I guess it's only the whales that matter. Other stupid quotes include \\"It's ironic. While men were killing these creatures, they were destroying their future.\\" and \\"You have saved this planet from its own shortsightedness.\\" I decided to watch all of the Star Trek movies and I was told about the horrible plot beforehand. I forced myself to sit through it. This film is just as bad as I expected it to be.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I've used the highlight on my kindle more than ever.  Sheryl crystalizes many of the thoughts we all have daily and provides fantastic statistics and stories to easily convey her messaging to people who haven't read the book.  Even with her extreme success, she quickly becomes not only someone you identify with, but someone you'd love to work with.

B009I2UH2W|1.0|This charger looked well made and appeared to be a quality product, but after the first charge, it failed to work.  I tried the charger in other car charging ports just to be sure and it failed in all of those as well. I'm beginning to think that car chargers are just junk and that there is a reason why most of them are so cheap.  This being said, I will probably be looking at getting the New Trent IGeek IMP99D external battery for on the go charging. This is the future, right?
B00AESN8XY|5.0|No two games on Plague Inc. are alike - if you love strategy then this is the game for you.  Very addicting.  Would like the character limitation increased so that more creative names can be used.  All in all it's a great game!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of my favorite films in the last couple of years.  I really thought it was well directed and produced, and the special features offer even more insights into the film that make you appreciate it even more. Well done indeed.
B0035G0U2O|3.0|The movie is okay, but the quality of the video was pretty bad.  Otherwise<br />would have enjoyed it a bit more.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|You can probably read hundreds of reviews on the movies elsewhere, so I'm just going to say that this edition looks terrific on blu ray. I've never seen the movies look so good.  Great special features as well.
B0077190MO|5.0|could not stop watch it. you will not be disappointed.  The British have finally come forward in this and many other programs.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could read these over and over again and I couldn't believe the price.  Can't wait for the other 2 movies to come out.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's cool I guess I like using when I need to know how long I need to plug it in
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I gave this to my daughter as a gift... I have heard no complaints from her. The shipping was super fast and it was in excellent condition when received.
B007CSWMWM|5.0|this book is required for my psychology class. i delayed getting it until the semester was halfway through. it arrived very quickly and in good condition.
0802473156|5.0|This book is very informative and is very helpful to understand the different love languages. It did meet my expectations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app and love it.  I actually carry my tablet to church now instead of my leather back Bible.  It is very easy to use and works great with highlighting text etc.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This is a terrific read. I found myself loving this instalment much more than the first two books, which were a hard slog. This is a book to be savoured- don't rush your way through otherwise you'll miss a great character, vital scene, clue etc. It does, however, ruin the TV show as season 3 does not run true to the book in a few crucial ways, unlike the first two seasons. I am now enjoying my once favourite show less, but it's a small price to pay. Reading is better for the soul anyway!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and story line. Would like to see<br />a sequel. Hint button useful and skip feature available if needed.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Professional Networking experience has been extremely positive.  I have found great value in reading the many great publications.  Extremely easy to use.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I know a good app when I see one. It's been a good weather forecast predictor. The weather is important for me.
B007X1ZQSU|5.0|If your a ThinLizzy fan this is a MUST HAVE to add to your collection!  Their music never gets old.
B0058W74UY|3.0|Ok, if it doesn't work, it's cuz u need a diff browser! It's called Dolphin Browser, but it's not on here as an app!! Go to [...] (YouTube) and look up how to download Dolphin Browser
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This was a very good book and one you didn't want to put down.  A great suspenseful mystery.  Good author and I want  to read more books by tis author.
B00632HWOG|5.0|So far so good on the Kindle Frie HD<br />I've had Yahoo for many years and it works well for my needs.<br />No complaints.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is fun to play and I just skip the advertising. Will continue to use it again and again. Thanks.
0061808121|5.0|Planning on a May road trip to Arizona and will be listing to “To Kill A Mockingbird” at that time.<br />Please email me sometime around the end of May and ask how we rate To Kill A Mockingbird.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Sometimes I am dragged by my daughter to see kid's movies, but this one was a pleasant surprise. Just keep a childlike spirit when you watch it!
015206396X|4.0|I received a copy of [[ASIN:0547258305 Graceling]] from Amazon Vine, having selected it on a whim. I had the impression it was written for the teen/young adult market, and thought a sample of the genre would be interesting.<br /><br /> I liked Graceling. It's quite well written, pitched at the youth audience. The language is not exactly like junior high vernacular, but it is far removed from Tolkien, and makes for an easy read.<br /><br /> People have objected to the sexual references in the book. I found them appropriate for the age group - this book is certainly much less suggestive than network television.<br /><br /> I recommend this book, with reservations, to young teens. Parents' choice on the mild sex. For 16-up, it's fine.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Captain America is the Superman of the Marvel universe. He is the ultimate good man, who does what he does for others more than himself. He is humbled and selfless and these are the reasons we love him. The idea of bringing a character set in a time that we have yet to see a superhero in, was risky and well worth it. The casting is phenomenal. Chris Evans absolutely shines as the lead, a role he plays brilliantly. He's understated and humble. He seems like a real man, someone we could see ourselves in. Stanley Tucci is fantastic. There is no other way for Stanley Tucci to be. Hugo Weaving again plays the bad guy, and we realized why he does. He plays creepy and terrifying better than anyone. Other roles include Tommy Lee Jones as the non believing skeptic, which he plays flawlessly, Hayley Atwell brings female strength and gusto as Peggy Carter, Dominic Cooper captures a very Robert Downey Jr. esque cocky sarcasm, which is fantastic as he is playing his father, Sebastian Stan is wonderful as Caps loyal sidekick Bucky, and an almost unrecognizable Richard Armitage plays the German agent assigned to disrupt the Rogers experiment. All roles are played gorgeously. The settings are beautiful, the effects stunning, the story is as good as it could have been. It does drag at times, but we'll worth the watch. Captain America is one of the world's most beloved heroes. This will show you why.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was just as good as the previous three. It will definitely keep you in suspense. A series that is worth read.
1608871452|5.0|This book is a must have for fans of the show. Information and pictures galore. And it has so many goodies packed inside! I am very happy to have this book in my personal library. My boyfriend is not a big fan like me and even he said it was really cool.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Je n'ai pas encore fini de lire ce livre (j'en suis &agrave; la moiti&eacute;).<br />Je le trouve agr&eacute;able &agrave; lire, plein d’anecdotes. J'aime bien les clins d’œil aux ouvrages pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents (IT).<br />Il y a manifestement un sacr&eacute; travail de documentation sur les ann&eacute;es 50.<br />Mais... je n'arrive pas vraiment &agrave; m'attacher au personnage ni &agrave; sa mission. Peut être est-ce dû &agrave; la mission elle même: sauver Kennedy? bof, pourquoi faire?
1616550414|5.0|The book is simply amazing. It covers the timeline and etc, but that's just for the psycho fans, like Aonuma said in the book, the story of the game never is the heading point, so the chronology is NOT something like &#34;OMG dats the official way of life&#34;, it's just an effort to let the player think about it.<br />The real point of the book is the process of the game design, the line of the design work. The artworks compilated were never seen before by someone out of Nintendo doors, this is just gratificating.<br />I'd recommend the book for designers and fans who are eager to know the real secrets about the way Zelda is made. And who don't are familiar to the series, is somehow estimulating to actually play the series.<br />It's a good book for everyone, but especially for the fans.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I can't rate it as it was not for me. It was a gift. The item came quickly and the recipient was very glad to receive it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so nice I first thought this was a craft site but it is so much more. It's cultural, artistic, fashionable, urban, country, you are able to collect information about probably anything from anywhere onto these boards and share with others from all over the world.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google's browser is always a good item to include on one's computers whether, desktop, pc or tablet. It is used on all my machines,
B001GCUO4S|5.0|order for my husband he had 1-3 and five did not have 4 so i order it for him could not find in stores and at a great price
B00BQBNK04|4.0|Have seen the movie 3 times and can see it in my head as they sing.  I think I would like it better with singers with more classic traiiiing, but I love it every time.  I saw the Broadway production and the movie.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR PEOPLE TO PLAY.I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO TELL A FRIEND.AND THEN THERE WILL BE MORE GAMES TO FOLLOW.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just love this series the whole family watches, always new twist and turns , cast of characters is great
B000B589JI|2.0|I had gotten one of these for christmas back in 2000 and it works perfectly. I ordered another recently and the chamber will not hold zippo fluid without leaking. The O ring is bad, and the threading will not lock down like the old one does. Maybe this new one was made in china. Trying to fix it on my own with tape and new O rings. not much hope though...
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I cannot help but cry everytime I watch this movie. Now, I don't want that to deter you from checking this out! Yes, up front, it is a little sad, but a truly great story worth checking out. Shows the bond of family and friendship and how you can never, never give up. Hope can blossom anywhere. :)
B007RY2XH0|2.0|Whilst I was happy to agree with most of the reviewers' high praise, and accordingly bought the book based on these, I found that two plays (La Com&eacute;die des M&eacute;prises & Le Jour des Rois) werre in French - which I do not know well enough to read Shakespeare. I have returned my copy and will try another version.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Seriously, I don't know who you are, but just go ahead and check this out. A great cult classic with a unique and interesting tale. It is a little older, but I adore this movie a little more each time I watch it. If you enjoy the likes of Sixteen Candles, St. Elmo's Fire or The Outsiders, should definitely check this out.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It logs you on and is usually stable. My main issue is that the App feels very cramped like they were trying to fit so much into it that they ran out of space. The pictures that appear on my timeline take up the entire screen and are not automatically sized down. I did have it freeze on me a couple of times and I thought it was going to crash, but it managed to recover. If they can make it so your photos don't take up the entire screen and fix the freezing issues, it would be a little more useful. As it is, I still have it on my Kindle Fire, but I rarely use it.
6304698623|5.0|I have always loved the Original Little Princess with Shirley Temple, so i was interested to see this new take on it. I have to say, I love it almost as much as, if not even more than the original! They are able to breathe so much life and heart into this story that you cannot help but be drawn in. This little girl's poor misfortune tears your heart out, but can still show you that no matter what anything could happen. You just have to close your eyes and believe!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's a little different format from the one used in iOS. I actually prefer this one over the iOS version. It just feels cleaner and faster. I can easily navigate between sections and it doesn't take much time at all to load new tweets.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|A good read but very 50 shades-sk. Still enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next book but it didn't blow my mind like I hoped.
B001JI8IJW|5.0|I have always thought Robert Redford is a wonderful actor!  This movie has him retiring from the CIA, and, during his exit interview, there is an underlying situation going on that prove what a good operative he is!  This movie is full of twists and turns and surprises that will keep you enthralled until the end!  There is enough action, and a little romance, to make it a good movie for everyone!  Download it/buy it; you won't be sorry!
630542845X|5.0|I have this movie on both VHS and DVD.  It speaks volumes about how our reactions to individuals who are different impact those individuals.
1416550550|5.0|Thank goodness I read this novel over spring break as I neglected absolutely everything in order to keep my nose deep in the mystery held within the pages of this story. This one is a wild ride that takes you back and forth between 1900, 1975 and 2005 each time-frame being focused on a particular character all of whom are intertwined and that is the mystery of it all. Through the back and forth between Maryborough, Australia and Cornwall, England the reader really enjoys the culture, traditions, and storyline of how the main character came to be in Australia. There is a great deal going on in this book and Kate Morton does a beautiful job of keeping the story organized and the reader interested. Even with the skipping between time periods and the interspersed fairytales of Eliza Makepeace (one of the lead characters) the author maintains a well organized and incredibly unpredictable storyline. I enjoyed the way the characters are layered and build upon, the relationships between the characters and how you ultimately understand the impact of the relationships and the time period on the decisions of the characters. It's all within the context of each generation of these ladies. This one is a must read!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is fun to try to beat yoy friends on facebook high score every day as welling.  My mom and dad have their own little competition going on so this game has become a family favorite._
B003TGMFG4|5.0|I hate writing these things, but I'm clearing out my inbox and copying and pasting into my other reviews.  What ever product this is was a good book/flag/muisic item/etc.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I like the mystery of the book and what the parents go though, but not to crazy about the technical part.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love it, can not wait until I can finish this season and move on to the next season.<br />Just wonderful.
B0097RU0SE|5.0|JUST WONDERING IF THIS WILL BE RELEASED IN THE U.S.<br />NEED MORE PAL FORMAT TO BE RELEASED IN THE U.S.
B00005JKG9|1.0|I found it boring and somehow I ended up with 2 dvds;  I sure didn't intend to pay for 2 but the<br />shipping would be too high to return it;  I'm sure.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Absolutely loved the new season of The Walking Dead. Hate the governor, love Rick. A lot of sad things happen. Main characters killed off. Didn't love that. But overall amazing season!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game_ wish there were more levels on the arcade option.  I would and have told others about this game
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works Great!!! Fits the Kindle great and works well. Moreover, the cable charges other things as well. I use the cable to charge my phone.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|It's up for debate if this one is better than the first one however it is very action packed and starts out with a bang.
0770433782|5.0|This book has lots of great ideas for the modern bride. My daughter wants something a little different and this has given her great pictures to show the florist, caterer, friends, etc. Our florist even got the name so he could get one.
B0088TG252|5.0|This is a movie that is worth watching. It is very suspenseful and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|This record is great!<br />Sounds amazing like Dave said in the doc!<br /><br />This is a must have for fans of any of the artists that perform on this record.
B005TBN3EU|5.0|If you have seen part one then you have to watch part two. This movie is great and will keep you laughing.
B000BNTM96|5.0|This is a great must have for any Queens of the Stone Age lover.<br />The live footage & some of the archived footage that are on the dvd<br />are amazing to see with different versions of the Queens of the Stone Age<br />line up.
B00AH8X1O2|5.0|This series is awesome the zombies are great and the series keeps you hooked. You will be waiting for the next episode with anticipation!
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Ideal movie for a lazy Friday evening when the only thing you want to do is laugh a little and don't want to watch anything serious.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|007 delivers again with a suspense filled action packed in hour face movie. I love the bond flicks and this one is no exception.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed most of the season and thanks to amazon instant video I was able to watch it.  Easy to access.
B008COD5OO|5.0|This is a funny movie that should be watched with friends. You will be laughing the whole time. Definitely worth watching.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. I was a little thrown by it not getting to the dragon part and then wondering what they are going to do with two and a half hours for the next movie but Pete has never disappointed before.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this movie if you like action suspense thrillers. This movie is all three. Worth watching!
B0087EACJK|3.0|While there's nothing wrong with the game itself, it just wasn't fun to me. Surprising since i usually love games from this publisher.
B00845PV16|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be just awful. I recommend not wasting your time or your money watching this movie.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|My 12 year old loved it!  We rented it for family night! My 14 wasn't as interested. Overall we liked it!
B007H7XJD4|5.0|This movie is now among my favorites it was a lot better than I expected it to be. You won't be disappointed Witt this movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Sleep soundly in your bed at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on your behalf.  Having served in Afghanistan as a surgeon and seeing  what these men could do on a nightly basis was incredible.  They never bragged about their exploits so the average American has no true understanding of the sacrifices  t hey make for us.  Thank you all
B0083GPDBO|4.0|This was a good suspense movie it will definitely keep you watching and is well worth renting. It is not a waste of money.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|granddaughter loves it she downloaded it for herself. plays it a lot and seems to enjoy it she plays a lot of these type games
B0091REZMW|4.0|haven't had any problems yet! fun and many things to explore. a great hidden objects game. download and see for yourself
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|It wasn't what I expected and that isn't a good thing, it was a total disappointment...made to take advantage of the Rings craze....
B001A5HBAG|4.0|I have heard so much about Mad Men and finally decided it was time to check it out. I love it! For the most part the quality of the streaming has been pretty good...had a few problems during episode 6, 7 and 8 but lasted less than a minute every time.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I thought the movie was generally pretty good except for the ending....didn't like it...the special affects were very real and thought provoking...
B005K17RU0|2.0|And difficult to sift through. maybe some more bells and whistles but getting to the bottom line forecast is a giant pain. it used to be a 4 star app, but now it's a 2 star app. but it's free, so who can complain too much?
B00B23O96A|3.0|Keep hoping that each new CD will be as good as so many in Eric's past.  There's a few good songs on this current CD, but nothing that really screams out at you.  It's just ok.  He is capable of so much more!  When you think about all of Eri'c early stuff from Cream to Blind Faith, to Derek and the Dominos, to so many of his blues numbers where he just rips on guitar,you know the man can play, but I think he's been going through a funk for the last couple of years.  Old Sock is a aprapo title for many of the songs on this CD.  For the next CD, please give us what you truly are, a masterful, bluesy guitar virtuoso.  68 is not so old that you can't give us your best, just ask BB King.  He's still rocking!
1416550550|3.0|The Forgotten Garden makes reference to many other books (all of them my favourites), both directly and indirectly. I caught echoes of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca and Jamaica Inn, Jane Eyre, The Thirteenth Tale and of course The Secret Garden. There are also many fairy tale elements sprinkled throught out the book and it strives to be as enchanting and magical as the cottage garden where much of the story takes place. For me it didn't quite get there but I appreciate what the author was trying to do.<br /><br />The book is nicely written and I didn't mind the shifts between characters/eras. Unlike other reviewers I found Nell's decision to isolate herself when she learns of her past to be plausible if not easy to sympathise with. The biggest issue for me was the fact that I couldn't dive into this book and become fully immersed in it the way I wanted to. It was a shallow read and I skimmed quite a bit. The characters were lacking dimension for me and their dilemmas didn't pull me in deeply.<br /><br /> All the parallels and coincidences were too neat, and the discovery of the missing brooch right at the end when Cassandra and Christian just happened to be discussing it was the final straw. The other big problem was that the red herring was completely obvious yet the \\"mystery\\" is prolonged till the very end. I also found the story about the Mountrachet's family wealth originating from a terrible act of thievery and violence on a dark night to be unconvincing and tacked on. It is mentioned once and then never raised again.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cosy fireside read that is not too challenging or unpredicable then you will probaby enjoy this. It's a pleasant enough book to while away a few hours.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Have always been a fan of Bowie's, ever since the 70's.  His music stays as fresh today as ever.  He evolves with the times, never gets in a rut or goes stagnant.  There are so many good songs, that you can't wait to get to the next one.  David continues to be a trend setter.  Like a good wine, he gets better with age.  Songs like Dirty Boys, and The Stars (Are Out Tonight), and Dancing Out in Space, just to name a few, so classic and brilliant Bowie.  Hoping Bowie puts together a tour this summer, because with new music to perform, his show would truly be a work of art.
B00008972S|5.0|I have loved West Side Story since i was a kid but what I really love about this collectors set is that it comes with a documentary that is full of information about the making of the movie. The troubles, what makes it so special, and just the trivia that i love so much. I don't even usually buy a movie unless it has all of that with it. As much as I know about movies I love this one told me some things I had no idea about. For example, None of the voices singing are the actual actors. There were also recordings of Natalie Wood actually singing her parts. This collector's edition is now a most cherished part of my movie library.
B009FZFONO|3.0|The whole season was a build up to a showdown between Rick and his people versus the Governor and his people. The ending did not deliver, no big showdown, no closure and the Governor hangs around another season.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|Fantastic film, with intentionally cheesy special effects, and many surprising twists and turns. The sight gags are superb. Bruce Campbell is a fine actor, great with physical comedy and superb timing.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! The author did a great job of creating a new world that still reminds us of our own. I enjoyed the elements of the fairy tale interwoven with the dystopian elements we're seeing so much of now. The storyline was both familiar yet the author did a good job of keeping me surprised and interested. Can't wait to start the next book in the series!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this show.  It has a great story line, great characters. Can't wait to watch season 3 with my friends.
0553208845|5.0|This is my favorite book.  It's small and perfect to jump in anywhere and leave behind.  I find myself buying multiple copies so that I may share them with others.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show.  Been watching it for years. Can't wait to watch the last episode and find out who the mother is.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is great to look up the weather first thing everyday, to plan what to wear and activities for the day.<br />The TV  gives general weather but this is for my house!
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I really enjoy Ken Follett's writing and story telling.  Am very interested in this period of history and have visited the Battle of the Somme region, visiting many cemeteries.  Great book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Have to say i really love this game I got it for my daughter but I have ended up playing it more than her
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Again, loved this book.  I could really identify with the characters and felt I had got to know them from the first book.  My parents met during WW2 and although I found some of the German sequences harrowing, I really enjoyed this read.
B007TB5WE2|4.0|I enjoyed the historical backdrop of the story. Amazing how Imperialist pride determined false perceptions. Formulated the news of the day and even confused an investigation.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I gave this show 5 Stars because I love the story line so far and the production is really good.<br />If you like Knights and Medieval things that is geared more for an adult viewership rather then for kids then you would prob love this show.<br /><br />It does have some strong language and Nudity in some shows so I would not recommend for children.
B003B02PF4|4.0|Not as good as past books but still worth reading. To much of the story is spent with translating and not enough time with the story.
0812982622|5.0|Two years ago, I read Barbara Demick's NOTHING TO ENVY (which I highly recommend) and since then, I've been drawn to books about enigmatic North Korea.  I picked up THE ORPHAN MASTER'S SON knowing little about it other than that it is fictional, set in North Korea and the author had done extensive research (including spending several weeks in Pyongyang) so as to portray everyday life in North Korea as realistically as possible.  I was not disappointed!  I found parts of this book to be difficult to read as they describe a life that is so grim and radically different from our own and yet, I could not put it down.  The writing is excellent, the characters are memorable and the story is multi-layered and beautifully woven together.  I love books that eventually \\"tie up all the knots\\" in clever and creative ways and I appreciate strong and effective endings.  This book has both.  I recommend THE ORPHAN MASTER'S SON highly.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|What more do you need?<br />New documentraies?<br />You got it. Its all here.<br />And the old 'making of' docos too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I've ever seen anything with this many 5-star ratings on Amazon, and now I can say definitively that they are well deserved. I bought the Omnibus edition on reviews alone, having no idea what I was getting myself into. I finished all 500+ pages in less than a day, not because it was a overly easy read, but because it was devilishly difficult to put down! I would recommend this to any adult, male or female, regardless of the genre they typically enjoy.
B008602KQI|3.0|Overall and ok movie for me and I do me just me.  I can see how others might fined this movie to be very good
B006MGDVIY|4.0|If you like racing you'll like this.  If not it may be a little slow.  Go for the rental not the purchase, as I liked it but don't suppose I'll ever have an urge to seeing it again.  RIP Senna.  Seemed like a cool character.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't know why everyone's whining.  Great app!  It has worked really well for me. Stop looking for reasons to belly ache.  :)
0393057240|5.0|Trainspotting is amazing.<br /><br />I read this book 10 years ago or so and loved every moment of it. It was a hard book to start but contained great rewards. Don't miss it.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Alfie Boe's performance of 'bring him home' is incredible - absolutely incredible. The rest of the concert is simply superb. That said, the finale with the 10th anniversary cast is spine-tingling.
B00005V9IJ|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Tom Hanks is already one of the best actors ever and this movie just proves that.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|An addition to our current series. Arrived quickly and was just as expected as we had viewed the show when it aired on TV.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just love this series. It starts out slow but it keeps you wanting to watch more and more. You just don't want to stop watching. I love the fact there is two worlds involved and the characters are involved in both worlds.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I got the book when I saw previews for the movie.  I still haven't seen the movie yet because I liked the book so much.  It was a touching story with quite a few twists I didn't see coming.
1451627297|5.0|Just can't say how much I loved this book. The best King book since the final Gunslinger novel. Exciting and heartbreaking all at once. While I wasn't born until after the Kennedy assassination, this book made me feel like I was there. I even went online and did addition reading about Oswald. This book is vintage King!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This version of Sherlock Holmes takes you to the solution at a breakneck speed, keeping you engrossed from the beginning.  His relationship with Watson is unique.  I will enjoy watching the series for years!
B003D0E3FM|4.0|When I was a boy, I was very excited over this movie. I am now sixty seven years old enjoyed reliving that past.
B001G7SS96|4.0|I bought this because I heard there was another version of the film before it was released to the Theatres. It was very interesting. I like Will Smith and he seems to be a talented actor. This isn't in all DVDs to my knowledge.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. However now when I get on it tells me I have an old copy and I have to get an update. I still have not figured out how to get it. I would like to keep playing. I'm around level 17 and have a lot of fun with the game. How do I get an update?
B000O76T90|5.0|This DVD has a deleted scene that was needed to answer a question that Electricians spotted in the film. Very short but good with a couple of seconds in B&W because it was never intended in the final cut!! Lots of Extras. I always wanted a tape of AMC TV 'The Definitive DIE HARD' on television. My wish came true finally! Yippe Ki Ya!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|great series,  I wish it could be on more than once a week.....it just gets better and better.....great great great
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like Mahjong very much.  Loaded it onto my Kindle and I can play games when I get tired of reading.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|For a few dollars this game is worth it,  the kids keep busy when in a situation that I need them to sit for a bit.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|you will not be able to put it down!<br />Jo Nesbo is probably one of the best writer today.<br />I can't wait for his next book!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I loved the features, I loved the night-stand mode, I loved the weather, and I even loved the look of the app in my kindle's carousel.<br />I loved everything so much, I almost paid for the full version, except for one persistent problem.  Clearly the dev's have 20/20 vision.  However, when I wake up without my contacts or glasses on, I have to bring the screen up to my nose to see the Snooze and Dismiss buttons. If you can read a book without glasses, you probably won't mind, but many of us can't, first thing in the morning.<br />So, I'm switching to a different alarm app, one that doesn't look at pretty or double as a clock, but does have big buttons that take up most of the screen.  If this problem is fixed, however, I will gladly switch back.

B0038NN3B4|4.0|This guide is a great way to understand the science behind the Atkins approach to eating.  The daily menus are helpful and the food lists provide easy shopping lists.  The hard part is giving up carbohydrates as a whole, since I am a carb addict!

B0063IH60K|3.0|I am new to on line card playing and found this card game a new version to me of solitaire. So far I am enjoying the change.
0061906220|5.0|We purchased this for our granddaughter who loves cats.  It was a hit - the rhyming words are so melodious that you almost want to sing them.  Its also simple enough that it encourages our beginning reader to read it herself.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Got the mouse 3 days ago and set it up without hassle.  Had to download the software off of the website but I love the customizable buttons.  I have settings saved under a profile for work email short cuts and games that I play frequently.  Fast, responsive and stylish.  Best deal I've seen for a gaming mouse.  Save on batteries because it is a chord to the USB but the ease of use is totally worth it.
0470901071|1.0|Why would you assume reader have achieved Network+ certification?<br />This book don't have section &#34; Who should read this book&#34; in the introduction, but in the first chapter the book say &#34; we assume you have Network + already&#34;<br /><br />very disappointed!
0061950726|5.0|Since our own first purchase of Orphan Train, we have bought several more copies as perfect presents for our reading friends! The deftly drawn balance of two intersecting story lines, and the illumination of a little known chapter of American history, make this a book to embrace and savor.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I should have stopped reading half way through like I wanted to but I thought something spectacular was going to happen at  the end. I was so wrong.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|All the actors are great in this movie, particularly Tom Cruise and Malin Akerman's relationship.  Every one of them makes this silly premise perfect!  Julianne Hough, what a voice...<br />The 80's were about punk but rock did remain king.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is very entertaining. It is a bit predictable, but you still enjoy the journey. There are a lot of good characters.
B0083Z614S|3.0|A classic.  I had never read it and although it is essentially a book for children, I did enjoy it. Happy ever after just like the best fairy tales.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Until I saw this version of Lincoln, I only thought of him as the president who freed the slaves; like only war made it happen. Sometimes it's hard to know or imagine what a leader really goes through to accomplish what is necessary. This movie showed Lincoln in all facets of the man himself. Through loss of his sons to triumph at the voting for freedom. Wonderfully done and oscar worthy.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I think one of the best books I have ever read.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  It really touched me.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I did not know if I would like a concert version of the musical, but after watching it on TV, I decided to buy it.  The staging, lighting, and costuming are brilliant.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A great read - loved that there was a twist at the end.  I have recommended it to many people and bought another copy for my daughter's birthday.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this book too. The characters seem real, I have feelings for them, I am guessing the different outcomes in my head, the writing is excellent.  I also love the TV series. I can't get enough quick enough- I seem to be a Throne junkie!<br /><br />I also loved The Once and Future King as a child, and I have read that if you liked Arthur and Merlin's story, you might like these books too. I must also admit I read Tolkien's books when I was younger, but not as ravenously as I have devoured these.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|To me a relatively new author, but I am hooked.  The author handles well the three generations of women. Very well written.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved it-read it twice. Now I have a problem- do I wait for Season 3 of the show to be over (it's only supposed to cover about half of this very hefty book 3), or do I go ahead and just finish reading the books and watch the show. It will take seasons for the TV series to catch up. I also love the show- think it is masterfully done and very true to the books--- but I want to know what happens!!!  I don't know what to do.  Suggestions?
B008476HBM|5.0|Enjoyed it much better this time as I could imagine the people after seeing the BBC adaptation.  No wonder it is a Classic.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|i think this movie should go down in history as the greatest film....EVER the world would love this so i think everyone should buy it
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Very well written - I had to read to the end but it seemed to be about two people both with &#34;issues&#34;.  It left a nasty taste in my mouth.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I ever use Document to go in smartphones, but recently I check and I saw this program with better ratings and I bought, but sincerely Document to go is better than, because you can edit documents, read it and for me, very important, is that you have an zoom that you can fix to the screen with the size of the letter that you need.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This season has the best cliffhangers by far, and so much happens so fast! This season is also much scarier than past seasons, but in a good way. Love this show!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was the best season yet! They really stepped up their game this season with all the new characters and plot twists! It's a must have! Can't wait for season four!!!!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|...but with the twist at the end, it felt a bit like it was thrown in, as if the backstory could have been developed a bit more. Still, it was solid.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|does have some language but a Real story with a message of hope for our future.  worth your time.  enjoy
B007W8S2MG|5.0|At the beginning when this game came out, I wasn't even thinking on buying it because I am not a big fan or RPG games, I don't like RPG games, I just played like a total of 4 during my life and wasn't planning on buying this one either. But when I saw that it was highly rated everywhere, I decided to give it a try, and I am damn glad I did. This game is one of the best games that could've existed. It has great storyline, great music, amazing bosses fights, and there are even moments that will make you laugh and feel betrayed or surprised, something you didn't expect that was going to happen. It really is an awesome game, even if you don't like RPG games, you should try it. This game is on my top 5 of the FEW RPGs I played lol. 5/5
0140120416|4.0|The only issue I have with this book is that the pages will tear easy because they are so thin. I was so sad when one of them tore. It is such a great book and I always carry it around in my purse. I can't stop reading it. I love this little book!! I'd even buy it a second time.
B006C45MRE|1.0|I tried to watch this several times when away on a business trip and it never would play correctly. I was very disappointed.
B0030N3O8Y|4.0|'s4' is an excellent show and I found that I was able to watch the entire series looking forward to the next episode or season. In this one Jack again shows himself able to compete with Chuck Norris being able to survive anything and being successful in whatever mission he takes on. His love life suffers but he has managed to have at least somewhat of a family. After 8 seasons the writers have done well putting together an interesting and 'somewhat' believable story line that kept this viewer watching.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|I generally like this sort of movie, but this one is more or less un-watchable. I didn't actively hate it, but it was boring and lacked any sort of wit.  I watched about half an hour and couldn't take anymore.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Chock full of surprises and twists making it continually pleasant and enjoyable to watch. The authors do have a way with their characters though making sure you never get too close to them but then that is what keeps me watching. I am looking forward to season 4.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|Pierce Brosnan is a great James Bond. He is smooth classy with a flair for the ladies. The perfect casting for Bond. The Movie is action packed with special devices and all the usual Bond toys. Great movie. Highly recommended.
B001B1R1EU|4.0|Like all the musical selections.  Well orchestrated, and good technical execution (to me at least).  Liked the youtube videos on other selections Alison plays.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Always great to hear something new from Jimi. Although I have heard a couple of songs before on the bootleg circuit and two soul tracks are not what i expected on a CD and not of Cd quality. The rest are worth having, proving just how inventive and prolific Jimi was. This Cd has come a long way from the likes of War Heroes.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Nice color, works well, love the elastic flap, but wish that it had just a small place to keep money or pointer.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|If you are looking for some quick reads, these are awesome! Full mysteries solved every 10-15 minutes :)<br />This is my go-to reading before bed
B0045I3EJC|5.0|So, I'm a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars and there was a tv show that Jered Leto played in so I knew his acting was good. If this movie had been at the movies, they would've got my money more than once. It's a mind-bender. It's kind of like someone took &#34;The Jacket&#34;, &#34;The Matrix&#34;, and &#34;Big Fish&#34; and you have &#34;Mr. Nobody&#34;. There's a few moments when I can't stop thinking about the old man being Jared Leto because he's like a 9 out of 10 for portraying a really old guy but, all in all, great movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was written in an unusual manner, as seen through the eyes of the father of Jacob, the mother of Jacob, and Jacob himself.  It held my attention throughout, but I was dreading the outcome.  I am looking forward to reading other novels by the author, William Landay.
B008602KQI|5.0|One of my faves the book is much better. well acted and great effects. can't wait for the next one!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I didn't really expect to like this much.  I never saw the show, so there is no nostalgic factor here and while I'm a fan of both the actors (despite not generally thinking they are all that talented) I just am so over the whole `High School Comedy'.  This, however, from the very first scene, was a pure delight.  It just never stopped being funny, and the cleverness of the script was impressive to me; the way they contrasted what is `cool' now and then to perfect effect.  Tatum struggling to be cool in a school where jocks are demoted for their shallowness and being smart and health conscious and `tolerant' is cool was hilarious.<br /><br />I blame `Glee'.<br /><br />The plot is full of holes and isn't really all that interesting, but it doesn't matter much.  The concept of them stopping some new drug from escaping a singular school is rather ridiculous since it would have spread far before it was noticed by the feds.  Hill and Tatum are a perfect pair though, and they juggle their dual roles (incompetent cops and incompetent students) really well.  The supporting cast is also at the top of their game, with Ice Cube spouting profanities left and right and Dave Franco completely making the most of his unfortunate face (that's just the way he looks).<br /><br />I also want to say that Jack Johnson, between this and `Safety Not Guaranteed', is like my new favorite thing about movies.<br /><br />Flashy, loud and fast paced, this buddy cop comedy is one of the best.
B001675YQ6|3.0|Entertaining enough without a really deep story Predictable ending and okay acting. A few funny parts. Would probably rent rather than buy.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|The shock heard around the world happened when Ben Affleck wound up UN-nominated for the Director Oscar this past year.  I had yet to see `Argo' but I was wholly convinced that Affleck and the film were going all the way with Oscar.  It just seemed like his time.  The film wound up winning the big award, but Affleck obviously couldn't win for Best Director.  Having seen the film now, I can understand why the directors branch didn't nominate Affleck (of his three films this is the more conventional and awards friendly but it is also the least inspired from a directorial perspective).  Can't say that I understand why this film swept through the awards season though.<br /><br />That isn't to say that `Argo' isn't a good film.  It's a fine film, but it's just that...a fine film.  It's rather generic and formulaic and it doesn't really do anything new or special.  The intensity that is carried through in certain scenes carries an air of staginess that doesn't truly lift the film.  In fact, Affleck held better form in both his previous efforts, and while he utilized his editor to better effect than in his previous films (whose primary faults were that they were too long) he failed to build something that felt fresh.<br /><br />Based on actual events, `Argo' is a thriller that chronicles a covert operation to rescue six American's who are hiding out in Iran after the American Embassy was taken hostage by Iranian fanatics.  Tony Mendez, CIA operative, is asked to find a way to get the six out of Iran.  Coming up with the `best bad idea' possible, Tony enlists the help of Hollywood to help him fake a movie as a disguise to sneak the American's out of the country.<br /><br />The look and feel of the film is pretty great.  I loved the way they completely recaptured old Hollywood, from the costumes to the sets.  The dialog is sharp and moves the film along really well (even if it feels forced in parts) and the performances, while none extraordinary, are uniformly fine.  Arkin is funny, Cranston is hard edged (until he gets all paranoid and starts to growl at everyone) and Victor Garber makes everything better.  Affleck is in fine form, and the rousing finale almost had me in tears.  I can see why AMPAS loved this, for it is a very good film, but I don't think I'll be thinking about this much in a few months.  It's just kind of there; a good film and serves a purpose and then leaves you.  Some of the facts were shifted, and some of the tension is completely manufactured (the ending plane chase doesn't work as well as they want it to) but at the end of the day one can't deny that `Argo' is very entertaining.s funny, Cranston is hard edged (until he gets all paranoid and starts to growl at everyone) and Victor Garber makes everything better.

B0060QM0AG|5.0|The people, animals and their antics are described in a way that is captivating and very amusing. Even though it was written many years ago human nature and animal behaviour has not changed and one can easily identify with a lot of the characters, two or four legged!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Nice gameplay a lot like army of darkness. Sort of a spin on plants vs zombies giving you a hero to play in addition to sending troops. Could use a cleaner menu maybe but still 5 star.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|\\"Song for Zula\\" is among the best songs of the 2013 so far according to Paste Magazine and deservedly so!  I had a chance to catch this up-and-coming ensemble in Bloomington, IN, and I was thoroughly impressed.  If you like bands whose songs are not carbon copies of one another, you'll love the mix this album offers.  Great sound and great guys!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This product is the world's greatest achievement in an app store. It will tell you how long you have Intel the device will die.It has  many great features including how long if you continue to do something how long that will last. Needles to say I'm impressed.

B000FA675C|5.0|I really liked this novel. The twists and turns of the plot kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I found this series interesting keeps you on the edge of your seat. It all takes place in a house that abides by a different set of rules then the outside world. Many of the people that interact in the house are ghosts while others are not. A shade creepy but keeps you involved.
0385523912|5.0|I have known for some time that things were bad in North Korea; I had no idea they were this bad. This book contains the eye-opening stories of several defectors; the title comes from a children's song about how people in the North have all they need, and so have nothing to envy in other countries.<br /><br />All they need, eh? The problems can be traced back to the disintegration of the Soviet bloc. At that time, the Russians and the Chinese both saw that it was in their interests to open trade with South Korea and to stop propping up the North. In part, this meant that North Korea no longer got the friends and family price for Soviet oil. No oil means no mining. No mining means no coal. No coal means no electricity. No electricity means no running water, no manufacturing, and no irrigation for farming. No industry of any kind means no one's getting paid. It doesn't take long for these things to turn into people starving and dying from other very treatable illnesses.<br /><br />The stories in this book are heartbreaking, but very much worth reading.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Addictive pursuit of the less capable species. Absolutely stupendous gaming that makes you want to come back for more. One of the best I've played on the \\"free\\" market and great for those bathroom breaks when you must get away from the boss.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I want a quick glance at what's coming up, and Accuweather provides that.  I think it is pretty easy to use.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|By now everyone has seen this movie.  I think Chaz Palminteri's portrayal of Sonny is the most accurate depiction of a &#34;mob guy&#34;.  The movie is excellent.  Add Robert DeNiro, and how can you go wrong?
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Best slender game yet!!! Pick a deserted street or a rundown farm. Your choice of night or day. Find the eight pages before it takes you. This game is definitely worth a dollar. Just don't be scared because I'm shaking!!!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|My wife already obsessed over Jackman before this movie for his gentleman-like aire and rippling muscles. Now he sings, too! Dude, give us husbands a break!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House has interesting characters and events.  The pace of the book is quick, which causes it to be a real page turner.  The main problem with the book is that it ended abruptly.  Overall, I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B008NA3I30|4.0|...there is no masked murderer hiding in the shadows in this movie, but there is something that might be worse, because it might be real. There are no bad people in this movie, at least not inherently. No one does anything to be vindictive or even because they are indifferent. This movie scares me simply because it was all so logical. That could be me. I love movies and good stories and take them for what they are in essence, entertainment, but the ones that stick with me, the ones I tell others about or give as gifts, are the ones that make me think and evoke a deep emotion. This film is a mirror and it will give you the opportunity for great introspection, if you will allow it. Not everyone wants this, in fact the person I bought this for has yet to watch it because it makes her nervous. Life isn't clean and it is good to be reminded of this amongst all of the fairy tales. This film will do just that.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I am an older adult and had never read this classic.  The story and characters are wonderful, interesting, and uplifting.  It is easy to see why this book is a classic
B00B47NO2O|1.0|This show had potential but has turned out to be garbage. The portrayal of law enforcement is a joke. These guys couldn't catch a cold and keep making the same fatal mistakes over and over. How many times do our 2 or 3 heroes go into a dark building and get jumped by the cult yet they keep on doing it? They never call for back up or secure the perimeter. They constantly go wandering separated and alone into dark corridors when they have the experience of the last 5 times they did it and some of their people got killed every time. I guess the lazy writers have to do this to keep this ridiculous story line of the uncatchable cult moving forward. It's a joke. The whole premise is dependant on law enforcement being the keystone cops.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This was a solid app. Didn't think I would get as much out of it as I have! Hope next version is even better!
B00A8OWOSO|1.0|This movie was just to vioent for me, and I did not watch the whole thing, not a good one for children at all.
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|This film was horrible as far as quality.  It paused and stopped throughout the whole movie taking up more than a day to get through the entire movie.  We were very disappointed!!

0439023521|4.0|Katniss Everdeen is a sixteen year old girl whose main goal is survival. Survival for herself, her mother, and her little sister Prim. Daily she hunts and trades to keep her little family alive.<br />The powers-that-be in the Capitol of Panem--what is left of North America--use survival to keep the citizens of the 12 districts in line. Each year a boy and girl between 12 and 18 are chosen for the Hunger Games--a brutal game of survival of the fittest.<br />The plot of teenagers fighting one another for survival was hard for me to stomach. However, the writing style kept me turning pages and the character development is excellent.<br />I would classify this as young adult though I know there are middle schoolers and upper elementary who are reading it. For these kids, I recommend a parent read it first then decide if it's right for your child.

He even threatens that if she doesn't find a cure, uprisings will begin and he will make sure everyone she loves is killed.<br /><br />Then an announcement from the Capitol that the next Hunger Games is the 75th anniversary called the Quarter Quell. This Quarter Quell brings the surprise that the Games participants will be chosen from the Victors. Since tradition says the Games Victors are supposed to be protected from any future participation, Katniss is sure this Quarter Quell is President Snow's way to squash any plans for rebelling.<br /><br />I thought this sequel was a little bloodier and sadder yet still exciting. I would recommend this to possibly older middle grade to young adult and up.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|When I read what this book was about it had already drawn me in!!! Then once I started it I could not put it down!!!! It has you hooked once you start on the first chapter! I like how it switches from the &#34;before&#34; to what the character was going through to the &#34;now&#34; and what her life was like now. It gave you all the details of her past that lead up to why she is the way she is now! It was just an amazing book! I would definitely recommend it :)
0439023513|3.0|Katniss Everdeen has survived again, barely. But there was more going on, more planning than she or even Peeta knew. Plans to excape the Game. Plans to overthrow the Capitol.<br /><br />They want Katniss to act the part of the face of the rebellion, but she's no actress. She is constantly trying to determine who is really on her side, who she can trust, and who is trying to use her.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' writing style and character development are incredible. Her books are hard to put down and the character are hard to let go.<br /><br />The most disturbing thing for me, and why I wouldn't recommend this to most people--especially anyone in middle school--is the number of child victims. The under 18 participants of the Games. The under 18 soldiers. And many more under age victims.

B00BP4ZNFM|4.0|I watched this movie with my kids 8 and 6 and they absolutely loved it. I haven't scene it in 30 years and it was just as much fun for me as it was then.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|This album was really good and a good listen for Hard Rock fans....but the album itself isn't really \\"hard\\" it's like an orchestrated piece of gold....made for a purpose other than just to rock out to...Part 1 was better because I was more rockin...and that's what I MAINLY want in my rock/metal
B00BWJARHO|4.0|If this trilogy is as good as the first, it should make a great series. Loved Lord of the Rings.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|It has been a long and anticipated wait but it is here and now I will review it honestly.<br /><br />1. Fast In My Car - A good melody and awesome chorus but not would have been my choice as an opener. The song is a different hear than any other album. It's a little No Doubt type. You will think it's weird at first but when you hear it again, you'll get addicted. 8.5/10<br /><br />2. Now - The first single from the record. Hayley's best vocals on the record in my opinion. The song is really strong and it is pretty catchy. When I first heard it, it was very weird to me but then I got used to the new style as stated above. The bridge is also awesome. 9.5/10<br /><br />3. Grow Up - My personal second favorite on the album. The lyrics and melody are so strong...it's unbelievable. I just think it's one of their songs. 10/10<br /><br />4. Daydreaming - This song sounds like a Brand New Eyes song. That itself isn't a bad thing. It is not a bad song...it is actually pretty relaxing. Just not a personal favorite. 8/10<br /><br />5. Interlude: Moving On - One of the first ukulele interludes on this record. It is pretty decent...besides it's not a \\"real\\" song so no rating is needed.<br /><br />6. Ain't It Fun - It is a really good song. It sounds like an R&B song and that is proof that Paramore is a diverse band. 9/10<br /><br />7. Part II - My favorite song. It has a part of Conspiracy (All We Know Is Falling) but it is a part to Let The Flames Begin. It is really creative. I love Let The Flames Begin and now there is a part 2!!! 10/10<br /><br />8. Lost Hope - An uplifting song. It has a harmonica in it. It is OK...doesn't really stand out much....7.5/10<br /><br />9. Still Into You - 3rd favorite song. This is a really addicting song...I've listened to this like 10 times when I heard first. I like the song...the melody is really pretty and it was an awesome pick for 2nd single. It sounds like Paramore. 10/10<br /><br />10. Anklebiters - A punk rock song. Sounds like a Riot!song. The song is really creative. The problem is it is short..9/10<br /><br />11. Interlude: Holiday - 2nd Interlude...I actually like this one better than the other though...<br /><br />12. Proof - This song isn't really a stand out or not really an honorable mention. It is kinda just on the record, lyrics don't really stand out but it is still good...not the best though....7.5/10<br /><br />13. Hate To See Your Heart Break - The song is beautiful but not a favorite at all...like the lyrics though...7.5/10<br /><br />14. (One Of Those) Crazy Girls - The song isn't all that either....It is ok....7.5/10<br /><br />15. Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore - Last Interlude....it is ok...<br /><br />16. Be Alone - This album picks up the energy with is kicky song. This is vintage Paramore. Sounds like another Brand New Eyes left over but this song is really energetic and I really like it. 9/10<br /><br />17. Future - This is the slowest and longest song on the record. It starts off really soft but then there comes this great emotional instrumental solo. That's how this song is....It is an amazing closer song....The song kinda sound grunge type to me...9/10<br /><br />Overall, this album proves a lot of people wrong who say that Paramore sticks to the same script. It has tons of variety and and be a listen for everyone, R&B, Country, Alternative, Rock, Pop; etc. It is a great addition to the Paramore library and I can't wait for what else is in store.<br /><br />Many people are worried about the change. Don't be. It doesn't change their formula by a lot. Every song had it's place on the album and the change is not as apparent as Linkin Park. The instruments are not as punk rock but more alternative rock but that is the only different. Buy it Paramore fans and for that matter....buy it music fans<br /><br />P.S. This album does lack in the area of awesome guitar riffs....It is alternative so don't get upset at the guitar work that much...I believe they could have been harder though
B001TM14VC|4.0|I never get tired of this movie. Good balance of drama, action and humor. All star cast and good acting.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Not as good as I had anticipated. With all the &#34;awards&#34; buzz, it was actually a let down. I'm glad that I watched on Amazon, rather then have paid theatre prices.
B0088QQ0CU|5.0|Must read if you want to become financially free & build yourself to success. Learn the lessons, live your life on your terms. ENJOY - a great read.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I'm Wallace.  Don't expect a bad rating from me.  Heh.  Seriously it is a thrill to watch (for the xxxteenth time) this wonderful film.  It is now and always has been a love story.  Only this time I have the privilege of watching it on my Kindle Fire!  Stop and start as I like without losing anything.  While visiting Scotland I learned of the importance of Wallace, their hero. How moving to see his statue when entering the castle at Edinburgh. Also learned how Braveheart helped further tourism for the Scots.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Read this book well over 8 years ago & still reading it. I recommend it as a starting point to everyone who asks me about my success. This book opened my eyes to becoming successful today.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and Fire HD and like how it arranges my files for easy access.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|There are a coupple of really good songs on this album, but it appears they can't keep up the level on this one
B005K17RU0|1.0|this app was easy to use, until I downloaded the new upgrade! Everything is too small to read, hard to navigate too. I want the old version with big easy to read icons. :(
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a wonderful series if you enjoy period programs. I did not start watching this on PBS until the middle of Season 3, and I enjoyed it so much I had to go back and watch seasons 1 and 2.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game, it is the greatest way to clear my mind after a long day at work.  It relaxes me but is quite intense at the same time.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My eight year old daughter downloaded this for her kindle and she loves it! The only improvement she suggested would be to have the option to change characters.  It's similar to Super Mario Brothers.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|This movie is exciting.  Not the best super hero movie out there, but the execution is very good.  Ian McKellen is excellent as Magneto, Patrick Stewart is fantastic as Professor Xavier.  Hugh Jackman is his usual macho self as Wolverine.  There are some definite surprising twists in this movie, and I won't spoil them for anyone considering this movie as an addition to the collection, but prepare to be somewhat shocked by the way events unfold.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game for children. Keeps mine entertained all day long. They will ask to play it any time they see my phone out.
B0080BFWE0|4.0|With such a fine 80s soundtrack and an easy going story the blu ray is one for the fans.  The DVD was very average in its quality whih thankfully is fixed in the blu ray.  When you want a fun easy watch thats a no brainer this is one that doesnt dissapoint
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Nice bright colors, will come in handy if ever I need a flashlight and can't find one.<br />Like having a mini flashlight with you at all times.<br />SLP
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This item is everything I could ask for and more! Great service and fast shipping! I would buy from them again!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|i like lark rise it is interesting can be kind of cheesey sometimes some of the charactures can be a little over the edge of not being believable where as downton abbey is good at being believable
B0019VTKIM|5.0|Challton Heston and Sophia Loren, how could you not enjoy this movie. This is the expanded version, although I don't remember what was added. During the time period was made, I found the battle scenes well done, of course with Heston movies tend to get wordy. But all in all El Cid is still a classic movie.
B0091VTISO|3.0|As action films go it's not a bad movie. The action is constant with a fair amount of humorous. But it lacks the the theatricality and great story of the original.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This book series gives you such detail it keeps you intrigued  and interested the entire length of it one of the best book series I've ever read
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I love how closely this series actually mirrors the books. Great character representation and fantastic scenery.  Every one of the seven kingdoms is unique.
B0030GCZM2|5.0|Can't predict the next move in this movie! Great action and suspense! Could watch again to pick up things I missed the first time
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I love books presenting tough material into a story format.  It could be one thing to explain all the psychological traits of how children progress given their individual situations, but it's more engaging to receive this information in a narrative.  A good read and great for any teacher!
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|It was fun watching this again after many years. Jim Carrey gives his finest performance in a well directed, engaging and often comical film. But the viewer must take a leap of faith that the television audience would really be that engrossed with the continuing often boring saga of one man's life.
B0013TPV0Q|2.0|Maybe I don't understand his humor, but I didn't find this book very funny.  I understand the humor of troubled-soul-in-strange-situation, but I didn't quite get this.  Maybe one has to hear him describe these as he does on NPR frequently to fully appreciate his style.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt given all the awards he's received for his writing, but I'm thoroughly confused why people love this book so much...
B0002CE19W|5.0|VCD (or Video CD) was a compact disc format briefly available in the early 1990s. Back then, Sears marketed a PHILIPS brand VCD player called CD-I (for CD Interactive). The CD-I catalog had an encyclopedia, video games and movies (such as a b&w Cream concert). The latter were issued on two non-compressed discs.** VCDs can be used in most DVD and Blu-ray players, also in PCs and some game consoles.<br /><br />**(This VCD dub of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is also on two discs.)<br /><br />Made during the height of Beatlemania, director Richard Lester's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a b&w simulation of a day in the life of the Fab Four that includes a live TV show concert. Superb rapid-paced dialogue comes across as ad-lib; the boys show much acting and comedic talent.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read. It's got a little bit of everything from past hits by Grisham, other than any sports themes.  A little small town lawyer stuff, the dysfunctional corrections system, and a good stick it the man/revenge plot. First and foremost it's a good con game tale. It's a real page turner too, for me at least. I've read Dean Koontz books that took longer! There's one plot point that I don't think ever got cleared up though...the DEA and the brother thing? How did he get killed? Maybe I DID read it too fast, I don't know. The title Racketeer was kinda an odd choice. I know he was convicted of RICO and all, but how could you pass up a title like \\"The Con\\". But I'm just nit-picking... it really was a good book.
B0014JLYS8|5.0|I bought these for my husband. He kept complaining that I had crocs that were solid and he didn't. So I saw these and took the opportunity to get him a pair. He has the ones with holes in them that he's been wearing since he was in Afghanistan. He wears the new ones when he heads over for his physical therapy which he's almost done with. Of course now that the weather has finally started to warm up he'll probably go back to the ones with the holes in them.  He said the new ones keep his feet warm which might not be good in 80 degree days. Guess now I should get some with the holes to keep my feet from being to warm.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK !!!  WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE~ I RECEWNTLY LOSS MY GREAT GRANDCHILD AT THREE DAYS OLD AND IT REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THINGS!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think the game is really fun and that the animals are really cute the way that they are designed. I love the game.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|What a great show to learn about the inner workings of a historically wealthy family . I like how it goes into personal lives of house maids and staff Al's the era of the early 1900's , it is truly a great show for all audiences !
0553807919|5.0|I have read other Dan Siegel books and found some heavy.  This one is great, lots of examples, divided by age groups, fridge door reminder sheet.<br /><br />I think that one of the best sections is about preventing trauma - I have used this technique with 3-5year olds with great success.  There are other books about trauma (eg, trauma through a child's eyes by Peter Levine) which are excellent, but the average parent won't read them.  This book gives great grounding in how &#34;fearful&#34; memories are laid down and how to prevent problems.<br /><br />Many non-reader friends have read and successfully implemented the strategies given, and at least 3 friends now recommend the book, which speaks for itself.<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer that reading Daniel Goleman - Emotional intelligence and social intelligence, and if you are really keen, Martin Seligman - Flourishing would tell you why as parents, and as a society, we should want our children raised in this manner.<br /><br />I'm a scientific person and this book appealed to me, less science minded people might prefer the style of Raising Emotionally Intelligent Children by John Gottman.
B00004THAY|5.0|Very bluesy. It has elements of rock and jazz. Very good music. Simply the best! Highly recommended. Buy now, you won't regret it.
B00B23O96A|2.0|No effort from Clapton to please his fanbase. I have followed him since Cream & have seen him 9 times including 3 weeks ago in Nashville. The Concert was much much much better than this recorded effort. However in the Concert he did not perform Layla.
B00445RHKI|5.0|Season 2 is even funnier than season 1. Maybe it's because I have gotten to know the characters, but the humor is sophisticated and constant. This show rivals Big Bang Theory in making me laugh.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|Very simple game. The levels are very repetitive and the overall production is very basic.  Controls are good and responsive. Try Polara if you are looking for an innovative runner.
B008OJ291W|3.0|Hey Jeff, I love you man, but your home studio efforts are not cutting it. It is like listening to AM instead of FM. The audio quality is rough and lacking in detail. I have heard this on Zoom, Long Wave and now this one. Really like your song &#34;Surrender&#34;, but I have yet to find it with a clean, clear and dynamic sound I know it has if done on the right equipment. A lot of artists are returning to tube analog equipment for masters before transfer to digital. All your old ELO albums that were originally recorded using analog equipment and then remastered recently to CD sound great. All the dynamics and detail are there. All the songs on this CD did not have to be re-recorded, the originals are still great.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Sad that this man was killed in our own country after years of dangerous service abroad. By the way, the book was published before his death so there is no mention of that in the book.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Never a boring moment. Great cast. great interaction between cast members. Mostly realistic police drama set in Los Angeles area. Michael Chiklis never fails to to be interesting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was completely invested in the story line and all the characters.  I loved how it was written and kept you wanting more.  The end of the book is a complete page turner.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I loved this book because there were so many things taught about how to LIVE with disabilities and challenges.  And the tender compassion of his wife and student was such a good lesson for those of us who are fortunate enough to have our health intact.  Morrie taught so many correct principles and they were easy to assimulate into anyone's life style.  I loved the way he taught us to allow ourselves some time to grieve and to struggle with our challenges, but then how we should make ourselves put those things on the shelf for another day and get on with our lives.<br /><br />We read this as a book group and everyone love it so much and were so moved by Morries' life.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It arrived so much sooner than I expected.  I'm using it to play monster hunter and kingdom hearts.  I have big hands so the attachment actually makes the 3DS xl more comfortable in my hands.  The joystick has a feel and response similar to the circle pad on the actual 3DS xl.
B00ABMZRVO|1.0|I have small children who use my kindle. Drugs,  sex of this magnitude.....this should be only available for purchasing. I strongly wish that you would take all similar off of the Kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game takes thinking skills its a great suspense game and mystery game I do think people should try it
B0054SMID0|5.0|Handsome, suave, oh and a good actor!! The story line was great! I really liked the twists and turns!! I never would have thought that the one who killed his friend/investigator was that person!!! Awesome. Thanks for providing this kind of quality movie.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This book will keep you guessing right to the end.  Interesting characters and great story.  Try it, you'll like it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was an insight to the lives of runaway slaves and people who helped them. I don't know how accurate the book is but I enjoyed the story line.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book was absolutely perfect. I loved everything about it and can't wait to start the next book in the series!!!!!
B003UESJFQ|4.0|Overall well done. You won't be bored. Get a glimps in english lower middle class life. Also price was right.
B0067Q04AM|4.0|Okay this is a great albulm, however, There are certain songs that are completly ruined by the annoying talking sessions at the end of the song, it completly kills the groove. They should have put the speaking sessions as seperate tracks. After the first time of hearing the sessions, it is enough. If you put your favorite song on repeat, you have to hear them talking at the end of the song.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!!<br />My children love that the horses are so realistic:)<br />I confess I like to play this game as much as the kids;)
B00A77II0U|1.0|After reading several reviews for this game and playing several similar to it, I was excited to purchase it and begin playing it. However, I could not get it to complete downloading, nor installing. I was shocked to learn with each attempt to download it, I was again charged 2.99 for each attempt. Nobody as usual to help in customer service...should have just opened the window and thrown out the 9.00 I am now out. Was a rip off for me. Hope you do better.
014305841X|4.0|It's hard to believe writing about corn could be almost poetic, but at times, the writing was so eloquent it actually distracted me from the message.  Often I found myself hoping he would get to the point a bit faster. Had I been reading, rather than listening, I think I would have skimmed over a bit more to keep things moving.  Still, a great book with some great information!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game provides so much fun that I find it hard to put down.  I'm definitely addicted to the game. In short I Love this game!!!!<br /><br />Luna
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My husband and I have both really enjoyed Game of Thrones. There are so many different characters and plot lines going that it keeps it very interesting and complex. Defenitly NOT for young viewers though!

1250027624|5.0|My friend got me interested in watching the PBS episodes and I have become addicted to them.  I'm sure this book will get many<br />of our friends to become ensnared also!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|DevOps and related buzzwords can be difficult to grasp but the book does a good job describing the pains in IT and how from that pain good practices can emerge and turn things around. You'll probably see yourself or someone you know in one or more of the characters...
B0054SMID0|1.0|Seriously flawed movie with mediocre plot, no character development, really bad performances (you almost think that the actors are going to burst out laughing while doing a serious scene), stereotyping, unnecessary characters (William H Macy, Kate Mulligan, John Leguizamo, Marisa Tomei, Frances Fisher, et al)  Jeez people! Is this what we've come down to? Avoid it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun to play, a bit addictive.  Kept playing trying to get 3 stars on every level.  Some levels were really challenging and frustrating, but that is good too.
0394818237|5.0|WOW this book brings back memories.  My brother and I read Richard Scarry as children.  Now I bought this and 2 other Richard Scarry titles for my grandson.  For extra giggles we always like to locate the worm on each page.
B004811PMO|5.0|We loved this movie. My 12 year old daughter watched it 10 times in a row over a weekend. it was great!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Cant wait to read the next one this book wasn't as great as the first but its really worth reading.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I've owned the vinyl, cassette, CD and now mp3 download of this album. Tight from front to back.  A must have
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app works as expected and I see no flaws.  It is working with Ice Cream Sandwich operating system on LePan II tablet.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I have the paid version of this game on my Kindle and the free version on my Android phone. It's good for something to do if you're waiting at the doctor's office, or at the airport. It does require some strategy, and planning, which I enjoyed.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I liked this book. The cover is a little deceiving as it is not so much about the American crew but is about the German fighter pilot. I didn't mind thought. I learned a lot about the way the German fighter pilots lived.<br />Good book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show!!!!! Takes you into the life of very high society. Very interesting to see the roles of the servants vs. the higher class.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Good book, sad story. I recommended it to my wife she liked it very much. Very easy reading, you'll love it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Could not click fast enough. An insight to a medical condition extremely difficult to imagine with the suspense factor which creeps up on you - the reader becomes trapped in the storyline similar to the web Chrissy finds herself woven into. Simply loved this book. Can t wait for Mr Watson next chapters.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Oblivion is director Joseph Kosinski's second feature film. His first film was Tron Legacy. Between the two films, it seems that Kosinski is not only talented when it comes to visual style, but he also seems to make unique and inspired choices when it comes to film scoring. Fans of film music will no doubt recall Daft Punk's excellent score for Tron Legacy - easily one of the more memorable aspects of that film.<br /><br />For Oblivion, Kosinski has called upon the French electronic band M83 to provide the score.  I'll admit that I had never heard of M83 prior to hearing the news that they'd be working Oblivion, but a quick sampling of their previous albums shows that they are very talented and I can now call myself a fan of their work.<br /><br />The Oblivion score is wonderful, by far the best score I have heard this year.  The classical film score style mixed with electronic sounds yields amazing results.  The music is a large part of what makes the movie a really fun experience - it's most effective when the music swells as Tom Cruise pilots his bubble ship through the clouds or rides his bike across the vast landscapes.  I've singled out a few of my favorite tracks below, although this is one soundtrack where I would highly suggest you purchase the entire album.  The whole thing is fantastic from start to finish.<br /><br />If there's a flaw here, it would be that at certain points I feel there is a lack of originality - one track sounds very similar to a cue from Tron Legacy, and several tracks are also reminiscent of work by Hans Zimmer.

0062197266|5.0|This book is crazy- in a good way. The first chapter sent chills down my spine; really got my curiosity going and I couldn't wait to see where this story was going. From that point on I couldn't pull myself away. The writing is very graphic, which at some points really made me cringe and I actually had to put it down for a bit to just compose myself. Despite that tho, I couldn't stop reading. I just HAD to keep going; I HAD to find out what happened next.<br /><br />I enjoyed the authors style of writing; having one chapter in the past, and then the next in the present; alternating until they meet. You get the see how the main character (Cathy) develops from the past to the present; and you then really start to understand why she is the way she is in the present.  I feel that this style is a great way to keep the reader interested.<br /><br />Overall this is a great thriller; and in my opinion, it's for the most part believable. There's nothing overly out of the ordinary; if any one watches those shows on Investigative Discovery, I'm sure you will read some similar things in this book. A must read for all fans of thriller. Highly recommended!!
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|Oblivion is director Joseph Kosinski's second feature film. His first film was Tron Legacy. Between the two films, it seems that Kosinski is not only talented when it comes to visual style, but he also seems to make unique and inspired choices when it comes to film scoring. Fans of film music will no doubt recall Daft Punk's excellent score for Tron Legacy - easily one of the more memorable aspects of that film.<br /><br />For Oblivion, Kosinski has called upon the French electronic band M83 to provide the score. I'll admit that I had never heard of M83 prior to hearing the news that they'd be working Oblivion, but a quick sampling of their previous albums shows that they are very talented and I can now call myself a fan of their work.<br /><br />The Oblivion score is wonderful, by far the best score I have heard this year. The classical film score style mixed with electronic sounds yields amazing results. The music is a large part of what makes the movie a really fun experience - it's most effective when the music swells as Tom Cruise pilots his bubble ship through the clouds or rides his bike across the vast landscapes. I've singled out a few of my favorite tracks below, although this is one soundtrack where I would highly suggest you purchase the entire album. The whole thing is fantastic from start to finish.<br /><br />If there's a flaw here, it would be that at certain points I feel there is a lack of originality - one track sounds very similar to a cue from Tron Legacy, and several tracks are also reminiscent of work by Hans Zimmer.

B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|The Album has really good songs. She takes us back to her Rated R days. My favorite tracks are No Love Allowed, Lost In Paradise, Stay and Loveeeee Song.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have not read other reviews. Is this actually supposed to be a kids' book? I remember outrage in some quarters in response to the Harry Potter books because they portrayed children engaging in witchcraft. Where is the outrage now with a book that portrays children killing each other?
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This was well acted, quite true to history and very captivating.  It should have been called Lincoln's crucial decision, or something like that because it was only about the passing of the 13th amendment, not really about Lincoln the man which is what I was expecting.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Really love this cd. Mix of rock, symphonic, electronica. Love to crank it up while driving.  Will be buying for my son. I know he'll really enjoy it too.
B007SSDBBM|3.0|I like cute love stories but this one was too stupid in its plot.  Also don't care for Meg Ryan in this movie.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|saw this game played on TableTop, looked fun, after 2 games im looking at the expansions trying to decide which one to get first
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|The movie in itself is an analytical masterpiece. Symbolism complements the themes of the movie which is great for those that try to &#34;get&#34; or understand a movie. The cast was great at their corresponding roles, can get a lot out of the movie if you look past the characters. Kevin Spacey will have you in stitches throughout the movie!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It's basically porn written from a woman's perspective....underwhelming as there is nothing new in what happens, how it happens and who does what to who.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|The movie was good but not one I would watch again.  The acting was excellent but the story seemed to drag in places.
0800141849|5.0|Saw this movie on cable.. Barbara is a good actress and she gives a good performance in this movie.. If you like comedy, this movie is for you.. Glad the way the movie ended..
