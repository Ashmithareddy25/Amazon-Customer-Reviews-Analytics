0307591549|4.0|An excellent read and a interesting look into the world of positive psychology.<br />You may well end up keep a journal, engaging in meditation and even exercising!<br />Be warned
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book dragged on and on. I had trouble finishing it, but when I did get to the end it was the most disappointing ending I have ever read.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great Free App for my Kindle-  I doubt I will ever be a good enough chess player to need any better app.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Makes me wonder what's next.  I recommend this read to anyone with with a curious mind, as it is deemed an actual event whether you choose to believe the author's experience or not.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Excellent movie! I loved the blu-ray quality! A heartwarming tale about a boy and his dog. I recommend for kids and adults alike. Every Burton fan will love it too, of course. I couldn't wait to have it on blu ray after seeing it in theaters and loving it!
B0087GJ8KM|2.0|I get that Dan Pink has a lot of fans based on his previous books. However, I truly do take exception to his lumping in all sales professionals with the likes of used-car sales people. Really!?!<br /><br />There is a huge difference between selling a car or cellphone vs selling main frame computers at IBM where we had a six month full time Basic Systems Training as well as a two week residential sales course before we were allowed to call ourselves marketing reps - ok a fancy term for sales professionals.<br /><br />Even back in the 1970s, I realized that we were all in sales, all the time. My mother said she never trusted me to give her a straight answer after sales training as I did learn how to twist things to my benefit.<br /><br />Sure, times change and being in sales now is different. However there is still the selling or marketing of one product or service to one person at a time. Everyone still is in sales.... but now everyone knows it because Dan told you so.<br /><br />Any other sales professionals feel this way?
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|I was very tired of seeing Helen Hunt nude.  It really wasn't  necessary it could have been done more tastefully.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|love this game but it keeps crashing on high scoring games uninstall then reinstall multiple times. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR THE KINDLE!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and different from other game apps. the graphics are much better than I expected. I am very pleased.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I think that it is the most fun game you could ever play. It will never get old..when you play it is like nothing could go wrong.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl is so inspiring. Amazing book and journey.<br />It really hit home at how lost you can become after you lose your mother.
B002APU580|5.0|My friends and I have played this DVD as background music so many times I'm surprised it hasn't disintegrated.  The cast is wonderful and the music is beautiful.  We now just call it &#34;The Movie,&#34; as in &#34;What shall we watch?&#34;  &#34;The Movie, of course.&#34;  I've read the book almost as many times as I've watched the movie, and there are major differences between them, so if you're a stickler for accuracy you might not enjoy this movie.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  It had the perfect combination of action, comedy, and suspense!  Would recommend it to any movie fan!
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling is a creator of amazing characters, as anyone who has read her Harry Potter books can attest.  Reading this book I felt as if I were in the town of Pagford watching the story unfold.  Each character, male and female, ranging in age from 3 to middle age, is fully realized, diverse and believable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use and easy to see.  I haven't found anything I really don't like about it<br /> Serves me well for quick calculations.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I've loved this movie for years.  The cast is perfect, the music is perfect, the settings are perfect.  In spite of the sometimes grisly story, I think of this as a fun movie.  I just never want to find an Audrey Two in my garden.
B007HACDLK|5.0|All rapp books are great this at the top sorry it had to end I have read all Vince flynns books and want a movie like reacher
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Your jaw will drop when you listen to this...the man Glenn Hughes back to his roots on this one...nothing bluesy about it...old school rock!
B001E25MBK|5.0|The Godfather has been a favorite movie of both myself and my husband and we wanted as part of our collection.
B008JFC6F0|4.0|To me, Tame Impala sounds like a cross between the Beatles and Pink Floyd with a twist of Nirvana. When I saw them on Palladia I broke a personal rule and bought a CD having heard only one song. I am not terribly disappointed however I gave the CD a 4 because the song I like is so different than the rest it makes me wonder if it was engineered to be a single and the rest is filler.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I chose a five star rating because I think it is a great and funny movie for the kids to watch.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I enjoy the game.  It's fun and I enjoy challenging myself to get three stars on each level. I recommend it.
0425263916|3.0|A friend gave these books to me in a plain paper bag & prefaced the transfer with \\"don't judge\\". They sat on my shelf for a month until i went away on holiday. I picked it up late one night and began slowly. Another friend told me to push through it gets better. It finally took off & now I am impatiently waiting on the third!
1250027624|5.0|as a raving fan of DA, I really loved reading this book.  The first edition wast gifted to me, so I really want this one!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I like the song a lot. Will like to buy more from same singer. Music with the contents of the song.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and loves it. It was brand new, unopened. Exactly as described. Disney is the best.
0880796863|5.0|Love the subtle and soft coloring on the cards and the light blue on the back. Yellow backgrounds are a little more yellow than pictured in the images, i'd say they look even better in person. The &#34;book&#34; that comes with it is adequate, but very small and short (as expected) morel like a pamphlet.
0920668372|5.0|Such a cute book! My son got this for Christmas and he loves it. I remember reading it as a kid and loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very creative.  looks so life like you almost feel ad though its real...  its cool that its like you get to treat your horse ss though you were a real trainer or jockey.. plus I love the fact that you can buy clothes and other accessories for your horse and also your rider.
1439190275|5.0|The book provided a plentiful amount of information as stated in its description. The item arrived as within its disignated time specified
B009VSW15Y|5.0|KindleAmazed by the ease and the technilogical advancement involved in the Kindle and the camera app Amazing!!It is wonderful!!Kindle fire I love it.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe is pretty much a required tool and this does serve the purpose for basic use. Go for it; it's free
B00004TS0E|4.0|ordered this movie was very good i enjoyed it i recoomend it to any one who likes a good holiday movie
0767802470|2.0|If you were not on a submarine I can't see how you would like this movie.  First disc 1 hour 30 minutes nothing really happens and the rest pretty much the same. Its a long drawn out movie with almost half of it you spend your time staring at the screen looking at faces staring into air with little or no talking. Battle scenes are nothing but depth charges hitting all around the ship and explosions within the sub which they always fix then more staring into space. If this movie expected you to get into the characters by useless time consuming conversations that really did go anywhere they succeeded. If that's drama then I will never watch another drama,. Yea sure drama the first time it happens but the whole movies battle scenes all look the same, same things happen, same things get fixed. I realize they wanted you to feel what submariners go thru but after awhile you start saying, will this movie speed up, it never does. The film is dubbed and way to much of nothing. There are two scenes that a German submariner stares at a clock, by the second time I saw that I said to myself \\" I agree buddy\\"... I was in the Navy on a Destroyer and this movie just fell flat.<br />Reconsider on the comments about the drama part, If drama is waiting for someone to talk then you get a lot of that on the second disk. I would have given this a 1 star but that said you hated the movie and all I did was not like it so I gave it a 2. I did like it the first time but don't go calling your friends over to watch it a second time unless everyone's got a pillow and a couch to lay on and fall asleep. A good movie maybe once but then throw it away unless you have submarine ties....
B00000294R|3.0|The CD I purchased from you was in ok shape. Mostly every song plays and sounds well except for one trac that keeps skipping. I'm pretty sure I read on your description that the CD did not have any Scratches. Kind of dissapointed.
B005VGMYZM|1.0|I thought I ordered CDs but they are DVD and I have no such player.<br />Wanted to listen to this music in the car or when out walking.
1401937519|5.0|wonderful book about a near death experience that is different from others I've read. gives a different perspective.<br />enjoyed it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it, this game is very addictive and fun. I spend hours on it. Everyone should get this game. Five stars from me
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and a great way to kill time. Simple enough to play, challenging enough to get caught up and lose track of time.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I was really surprised by how much I liked it. It was really funny and the cut aways actually work well.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|love the realness of the movie.  While sad, it is always nice to see that stars are real people too.  Love her even more!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great read.<br />Makes you cheer, cry, hold your breath and root for justice.<br />I recommend it highly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books were well thought out and bring me to believe that our world is not that far off from.<br />Our
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book makes you think about life and the choices we make or don't make.<br />Never thought it would end as it did.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is really addicting and a lot of fun. When I need something to relax me I play this game .  Love it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a real thriller! I couldn't put it down. It is a good read for both genders. Not just for women.
1847879071|5.0|It was in good shape and was the book i expected. It was the one I needed for my class.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|you probably already love Downton Abbey if you've watched season 1 and 2. 3 won't disappoint. It just gets better.
B00683JK9K|3.0|Looks good, works as it should, fun...but it doesn't have the option to install to the external memory...minus two stars!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Haven't missed a day playing this game! It's challenging without being frustrating and the graphics are great. Especially for a free game.
B00932A2MC|4.0|As I recall this movie came out in the spring/summer but I missed it upon an avalanche of other tasty confections of the season but this would've been a comfort for those who like this sort of fare but simply overlooked it. If you like sci-fi, love to explore, not a snob about movie vs. book versions of things Battleship is a good home-cooked meal. A bit short on the creature feature I wanted but strong visually with enough pop-fizzle-bang for the kids alongside a very &#34;thoughtful&#34; script allowing for credible adult attention spans. The breakout star is Taylor Kitsch of (Wolverine) but everyone is bringing &#34;full-on&#34; performances that leave you satisfied. Brooklyn Decker, the female lead, is aaight, lol, if you like that sort of bottle-blonde, Hollywood formula, leading lady thang, she's a proficient actress and none too hard on the eyes but that is to be expected. Rihanna would've been an unconventional &#34;beauty-babe&#34; choice, although her scant lines are delivered with punch and memorable panache.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great download and book.  Not completed yet but as usual I read highlights first and will continue with interest on this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is great because it now changes places first original then New York and now Rio. I also like how in the seasons it changes like at Christmas the dog is dress like a reindeer with 1 antler its really funny. It is also very funny when you and the bodyguard get hit by a train and you hit the screen, plus does anybody know the bodyguards name?
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Cheaper than iTunes, and any other online shopping source by at least 50 cents. You can immediately download an .mp3 version (INCLUDING THE BONUS TRACKS BRO) and then have the actual CD sent to your home in a few days. 10/10 would buy again
0765325950|5.0|I began reading this series a year ago when an injury kept me from doing much else.  This installment brings the entire tale to an action packed climax.  Excellent writing and character development by both Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|This is a family friendly movie and is my favorite movie of all times. Everyone I know thoroughly enjoys watching this.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I was really looking forward to this app because it was free but now after trying to use it, I have realized that this app is useless unless you buy it. I am very disappointed.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|As a fan of The Beatles and of musicals, I liked Across the Universe when it came out a few years ago. When I made a list of movies I should get for my new Blu-Ray player, this was at the top of the list. Why? Fantastic visuals, a solid soundtrack of Beatles covers, and colors that deserve 1080p.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It kept you interested all the way thru and it was amazing . It really showed how evil the husband was. And it showed how determined she was to get away from him by doing the thing that she had to do.  But she was the winner in the end
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This film may not have a great story, great characters, or win any Academy Awards, but it is beautiful to watch in Blu-Ray. Environments and animated characters look stunning in 1080p. Whether or not the story is enough to support the visuals is doubtful, but this is still worth having if you have a clear picture on your HDTV.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|If you like talk of particles, energy, matter and the make-up of sub-atomic designs but you're not in this field, this book will be something you can understand (at least most of it). Great historical build up to how the Higgs was born from theory to reality with a clear explanation of the political challenges, collaborations and costs of the LHC and other colliders that made such an invention possible.<br /><br />The book may be a bit long for some, over describing some of the histories and such, but the author does a good job of either noting when things are going to get technical in detail or adding it to an appendix to read later if you care. Again, this book is something a particle &#34;enthusiast&#34; can consume and understand so they feel a bit more in touch with the discoveries outside their own industry that has been changing the world.<br /><br />The book also grounds you in reality, explaining that just because the higgs is discovered in the wild, this doesn't mean we're going to have warp drives tomorrow (or ever) and that much of the fluff you see in headlines about how this will change the world as a god particle is just that...fluff. This is the building block to greater things and is needed to get to new discoveries but it's not going to solve world hunger or cancer. Very grounding for those that see it more of a mystery and buzzwords.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I saw the Swedish version when it came out and loved it. I saw this version when it came out and loved it just as much. Fincher achieves a new level of craftsmanship with this film. Beautiful cinematography, fine acting, a clean mystery story, and an overflowing level of style. Perfect.
B0091QSNEE|4.0|I first downloaded the free version of this game, but my grandson played it so often that I decided to buy him the full version. It's one of his favorites. He figured it out quickly & is teaching his 2 yr. old sister how to play. When I was playing with his sister, I realized that the tables are set or can be set with silverware that has matching colored-coded handles. She was placing the silverware with the plates according to silhouette shapes when I noticed that two colors of handles were involved. She wasn't penalized, from what I could tell, even though she was mixing the colors.<br /><br />We have no problems playing this game on the Kindle Fire & the Fire HD.<br />Nice app with lots of activities.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I read this book first time years ago in my first language portuguese. Now I chose it because I'm learning English and I needed any familiar book. This book makes me very happy and gives me hope in people. Else shows me how important is the love and simple things.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice big numbers world perfectly and functions flawlessly highley recomemd this app for your calculating needs download it right now
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like the sound effects of this game, and its more challenging than the others. I play this Majhong more now than the others, although I like them all this is my favorite !!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this CD even more than Adele 19.  Wish the new James Bond &#34;Skyfall&#34; was on this CD.  Maybe on the next CD. I love that song, too. Just wanted to get it on a CD with other songs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|what an awesome book-couln't put it down,will read next book and will need to read all of them again very soon.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game lets you train feed groom and compete in competitions with your horse. all in all its a pretty nice game and passes the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Unsure of it at the beginning but had hard time putting it down.  Wanting to keep up and purchased the next book.  What a piece of work,eh? Just a very incredable book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun! It is a game perfect for all ages! If you like temple run, then you will like this!!!
B001QOGYFY|4.0|I recomend this movie as all around good entertainment. I upgraded myself from DVD to  Blu-ray. I've owed the DVD since it was released to the public.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|this is killer!<br /><br />I only bought it because I spilled something sticky on my older Microsoft gaming mouse<br /><br />I had no idea, what I was missing out on!! and at $39? wow!  lookout, logitech.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This product does exactly what I wanted - holds a water bottle, keys, phone, and a few other things I might bring with us on a walk I have a Baby Jogger City Mini stroller and it works perfectly - I do not need to remove it when I fold the stroller for storage. I also really like the price compared to the similar item made by Baby Jogger. I have only had it a short time so I can't comment yet on durability.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good story.Good,but not great, it was a typical love story with the usual story line and ending.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is the best news app I've tried.<br />The categories are great and arranging them is quite easy as is sending articles to myself to email to friends later.
B00123KF54|4.0|I had this album as a teenager and am enjoying it again...The bonus tracks leave something to be desired...not top quality, but the original songs are first rate.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was a great mystery. No idea who murdered the family until the end. Plus you care for the characters. Gillian Flynn's best book.
1594744769|5.0|I fell in love with this book from the start! It's all about a teen boy named Jacob, and his life is pretty predictable, But one day, Jacob gets a wild phone call from his Grandfather telling him the monsters have found him. Knowing that his Grandfather can be a little crazy sometimes, Jacob doesn't believe him but leaves just to reassure him. When he gets to his Grandfather's house, he finds it totally abandoned and wrecked. Jacobs goes to the woods behind the house to see if his Grandfather is there. He sees him all right, bleeding to death on the cold ground. The last words of his Grandfather are confusing, chilling, and leads Jacob to his destiny. You HAVE to read this book!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks but I like him :)<br /><br />This is what I like to call brain candy.  An easy read- it may take you a day or two.
B008476HBM|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book finally.  I had seen the movie and the play.  I enjoyed it very much and will be looking for Sense and Sensibility next.
B005X5XIL0|5.0|It is great to be able to enjoy this wonderful concert over and over again.  I would recommend it to all who like music.
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|I give it 3 stars because it was really slow throughout the entire movie until Master Chief appeared than the graphics and the storyline really picked up.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a new classic, for sure. Pixar has master storytellers and have once again created a memorable character - this time a very lovely and real GIRL.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics, fun puzzles and it is a long game. I feel I got my moneys worth. Great time waster.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great. It is really easy to use. I love it. Now I don't have to look it up. That take forever this is way easier. Get It!!!!!!!
B005FLX2WC|4.0|The album is pretty good. I love the blues and these two together did`nt disappoint. His playing is phenomenol and Beth Hart`s singing is gutsy and raw. I did`nt like every song, but I would reccommend it.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|You will see in every review I write that I feel Beth is just incredible. I own every CD she has made,<br />Her lastest one just released in Feb of 2013 is Primo<br /><br />Anyway she is really one of the Best out there now,<br /> Buy this CD you will love it if you love Blues and well written music buy the artist performing .<br /> She is a deal that will make your ears and spirit feel nice.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I had a very hard time finding this battery at the brick and mortar shops. It was delivered quickly and works perfectly, great gift.<br />It was a very good value also.
B000088E6D|3.0|He didn't ring my bell, He is very talented but as a Blues and Jazz lover he did not turn me on<br />  Sorry Michael
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Love the youthful exuberance of Bruno Mars. He is extremely talented and very entertaining.  Everytime he plays live somewhere he gives the audience a little something extra.  Plus he is HOT!  Give me more of Bruno Mars ASAP!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I was very skepitical but read some reviews from others and listen to some cuts from this album.<br />  To be honest I did not like her other music but I am not into Rock and Roll.<br /> But Wow she nailed this piece,,,,,,,,,If you love the blues Cyndi will knock you out<br /><br />By the way I read her book recently, I could not beleive that for years I thought she was from England and I find out she is from the Bronx, Cyndi says We just have a hard time talking English in the Bronx, She is a hoot<br /><br />  Great piece that will be loved by many I believe
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this application. It is very important to me that any application I download be easy to use. This one is. Thank you.
B000C20VRS|5.0|It's a movie that will be around for many generations.....<br />  Just put the kids to bed first......Cause I don't think anyone has a true count on how many people get killed in this Classic Gangster Movie..........
B0004Z33EG|5.0|When I first viewed this movie I had just returned from Nam and his work in this movie really came through for me,  I watch it all the time
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Susan has won more awards than you can count.<br />  This is done with her band but don't worry this CD is 99% Susan and she is a fantastic Blues singer and guitar player.<br /><br />I own all of her CD's , I will put 5 on my player at once and then just have to force myself and enjoy this very talented womannnnnnnn
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Sandra Bullock plays the part to a tee.  I think this movie has a lot to say to people with addictions of any kind
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tong has some great duets he has done with many artists, I feel this is one of his best......<br />  There are some extremly talented people singing with him that are just at their best.<br /> I think you will be surprised how good everyone blends in with him.<br />  This is 100% of some of the best artists in America from all types of music
0545265355|5.0|This book was what I ordered and in great shape. This was the best price for the book! I even kept it to reread, very helpful!
B00006LFGD|5.0|Streisand is a Diva no doubt and she lives up to it here<br />  I wish she would shut her mouth and just sing and shut up about politics because she has her head up her butt about World Affais<br />A diplomat she is not close to being.<br /> But she is one hell of a Artist.<br /> I can't debate that and I really enjoy her work
0385486804|5.0|This is a good truestory about a young man´s confusion and the the sad end.<br />It makes you think how could it be possible to avoid this kind of tragedies<br />I recommend.
0679411585|5.0|I had the movie and book related to it. I bought this thinking I would find new information and it's is truly full of choice info on Nam<br />  I feel it is a great piece for anyone interested about Nam.<br />  I served in The Nam 1967/68 , with the Big Red One , First Infantry Division,. 1st/4th Calvary and was in the first Tet in 1968<br /> I was a M-60 gunner on a Armored personnel Carrier and there is no BS in the book.<br />It's the real deal<br /> Also a very good and intesting book to read, Hard to put down and regretted it when I came to the end.<br /> Hal Nailed it again as he did with his other book and movie
1423101502|5.0|Bought it for my granddaughter. She loves the series and couldn't wait to start reading it.  Will buy her more books
B003YWUTJI|5.0|She is a incredible artist but just watch what CD's you buy of hers, For some reason this incredibly talented woman likes to do repeats of many of her cordings and then change the name and add only a few new cuts,<br /> But I doubt anyone can say she is nothing but a fantastic blues artist.
B00881VLCE|5.0|magic puzzles is very easy to use, master level is challenging, unlike some other puzzle apps. simulates a real jigsaw puzzle!
B00005JKN9|5.0|The cast is the best and it's full of action like you would expect,,,<br />  Look at who is in the cast and you know it's a winner<br /><br />I have watched it many times,
B004SBX112|5.0|I like the varied challenges of the seasons! Keeps you entertained for many hours if you let it! Definitely would recommend you will enjoy!
B00005AXEL|4.0|I have loved listening to Stevie since first listening to her in the days with her group.<br /> I much prefer her solo and man she does get down.....and holds noothing back here<br />  Great CD.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this version has birds with varied and much different attack methods. A lot of fun an challenges you to achieve 3 stars! Thoroughly enjoy, I would recommend.
B007VCMGPM|5.0|I love his guitar tone and timing. He really is a great player, with great chops. This is one of my fave instrumental albums, and I play it constantly in my car.
B0061QD88S|5.0|This is a great family movie, great way to talk about relations, expectations and friendship! I like the moral of the story and embellish it.
B0030DIP7O|5.0|People sometimes forget how great the Scorps mid 70's albums are. In Trance is the first album produced by long time producer Dieter Dierks. I am always playing these cd's, great stuff!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never read any of Colleen Hoovers book before.  This was a very good book.  I was not sure at first but read it, it is good.
B008PALH0E|5.0|Wow.<br />The size of the orchestra/choir is breathtaking.<br />There is sheer excitement from the very first note.<br />Good camera work, nice close-ups.<br />A very solid recording, my favourite since Leonard Bernstein's 1975 Weinar Philharmoniker version.<br />If any part was least than perfect, it would be some of the soloist singers.<br />Excellent all-round!
0307352145|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who feels that the people around you just talk too much. Our culture overvalues extraverts and undervalues introverts.  Parents and teachers of introverts need to read this to appreciate all that quiet people have to offer.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book doesn't totally grab me, I read a few pages a night and at this rate it will take a lot of time.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|oh my gosh. I loved this app so much but know there are some serious issues. I had a ton of stuff unlocked and bought but then one day it glitched and now it doesn't work. all of it gone. it did it twice. buyer beware get hooked and then its all gone in two seconds flat.
0765325950|5.0|In one Age, called the Fourth Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose around my keyboard for this review. At first, I was apprehensive about starting such a long series of WOT books. By the time I picked up book one: The Eye of the World it was 2007, after the release of book 11: Knife of Dreams. I had a lot of catching up to do but am glad I did every bit of it! Brandon Sanderson did a great job with the series after the passing of Robert Jordan and I don't think they could have picked a better author for the task.<br /><br />This book is wholly devoted to Tarmon Gai'don - the last battle and covers pretty much every battle front with great detail. Every nation involved seemed to receive equal treatment and representation, as Sanderson/Jordan made sure to cover all bases. My only small complaint about the book is that while the battle scenes were good (and most of them absolutely necessary), sometimes they could get a bit overwhelming and tedious. It seemed the proper result could have been achieved by cutting back on the battle scenes a bit while using that space to elongate major events with Rand perhaps. Anyway, that's me nitpicking what was otherwise an amazing book and conclusion to the WoT. The major events were all handled well and there were plenty of surprises and unexpected twists in the plot. If you think you know whats going on, think again, because you probably don't! Also, I think its clear that by this book, Sanderson has a complete and firm grip on the characterization that Jordan etched in stone over the course of 12 novels. Mat, Perrin, Rand, Gawyn, Loial, Egwene, they all \\"felt\\" right to me this time. He got damn close in the previous two books, but this time he really nailed it.<br /><br />One thing I definitely felt in this final volume is the elevated presence of Robert Jordans writing. You can tell that some of this book is straight from his craft and was not all Brandon Sanderson filling in gaps. Long time fans of the series will definitely pick up on that. A Memory of Light delivers on virtually every aspect of the series and does so in epic form, concluding the story in complete and beautiful fashion, leaving you feeling satisfied at the end. While some may bash Sanderson for his work on the final three volumes, consider how difficult it must be to take another authors outlines and complete a series 11+ books in the making. A Memory of Light is probably far better than what many of us should even expect. IMO, it is easily the best of Sanderson's three entries to the series.<br /><br />When someone says the term \\"epic fantasy\\" none in history defines that more than The Wheel of Time in my eyes. Well done Brandon and R.I.P. Robert Jordan. You left us with a masterpiece of fantasy that will continue to inspire for generations to come. Also, to you people that are giving the book one star because there wasn't an e-book version - grow up! How about you get off your e-horse and buy a real book with, you know, actual pages for a change? Would that kill you? This book deserves an honest review, not a bunch of one stars from people too lazy to read an actual book.series will definitely pick up on that.

0307352145|5.0|I sure enjoyed this book. It provides insight to the introvert's personality and strengths without denigrating the 'others'.  Proof that you can lead quietly and effectively.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great game for the kiddos to use in car its fun and they are learning at the same time :-)
B009YQJ322|5.0|This movie is so much better than the first one. Great job by all actors. They had a good script to work with and good set design. Enjoyed every minute.

B0091REZMW|4.0|I just downloaded this game. I really like mystery games like this. However I did notice that it is slow to open and you have to download the graphics for each room. But otherwise its enjoyable. I have not run out of diamonds yet and was able to open rooms easily. Have fun!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|works great to have an extra cord to use in the car for a car charger that has a usb port
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Good inside picture of early alzheimer's- told from the perspective of the victim of the disease, it creates sympathy and at the same time an understanding of the disease.  It is fast-paced, but packed with information.  The speech she made, as a victim herself, was brilliant and touching.  It could be lifted from the novel and used elsewhere, I think..<br />This woman was brilliant, but her brilliance could not overcome what was happening to her brain.  She could only watch with understanding as her life was taken away, piece by piece..
B0086700CM|5.0|great game for the kiddos to use in car its fun and they are learning at the same time :-)
B004EF6632|5.0|Very well scripted and well acted. I watched all four episodes back to back. It was very nice to see Daniel-Denby-Ashe again as I had only seen her in an episode of Torchwood, which she was awesome in. Richard Armitage was sexy and awesome, as per usual. :) The man can brood and scowl like a champ. This was an absolute pleasure to watch.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book! I Thoroughly enjoyed it. I must admit that I watched the movie before I had even heard of the hunger games books and immediately afterwards I wanted to read the book and continue to read the rest. The movie did follow the book quite well and the little details that weren't in the movie were definitely a joy to read. Definitely a fan!! :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game it fun and entertainment to the hole family and to  the old and young people who want to have a good time
B00000J0O2|5.0|Its work great,package can in good shape and they send it really fast, Give then A++++ ++++ once again Thanks
0062014102|4.0|The author brings up very interesting points, and even some I had not come across before. I my opinion, he tends to rely on older or anecdotal evidence to support his theory, and/or relies relies rather heavily on the reputation of David Bohm.
0316017930|4.0|Makes a number of important points about human behavior and the path to success not vetted by others. Found it useful and interesting.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great thanks love them, thanks so much. Keep up all the good work to make all your customers happy. Once again thanks so much for a great product
0312360258|5.0|Bought it to get my kid reading more. I figured if she has fun reading, she will get better at it and I basically changed the way she thinks about reading. It worked. Book arrived fast and as described.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Gives the reader a chance to be there during the time period of WWII and come out on the other side feeling awestruck by the sacrifice these brave men made to secure our freedom.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|A very good movie...perfect to add to the collection with Men in Black 1 and Men in Black 2...will there be a Men in Black 4?, lol.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I gave this a 5 star because it is a user friendly app especially for anyone unfamilar with cleaning up caches, files, etc. I downloaded this out of curosity on my Kindle Fire even though you do the same thing on your Kindle without downloading an app. Haven't downloaded this app to my phone since I rarely surf the internet nor download apps or files using my phone. As for cleaning up your Kindle Fire (original or first) without downloading another app that uses up the limited amount of app space, I suggest reading the user guide for directions on how to clean up your cache from internet use and cache buildup from downloaded apps that you use, unwanted apps, and files. Honestly the only thing that this app found was 1 file that I had no clue where it came from so I did delete that. I then<br /><br /> uninstalled this app for more space for game apps.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|must buy for vita owners, any jrpg fan must play this remake of a great game for ps2 , you will never regret
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an easy read and was a good story. Great book for when you're traveling. I always enjoy his books.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I like your dictionary but it's so hard to find what your looking for for example if I try to find cat I can never find it because u got so many letters a that's that don't start with Evan c for cat
B008ALAHA4|4.0|My only complaint is that the magnet holding the converter into the computer seems to be less strong than my MagSafe 2 power cable.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a great app It may not be as good as the computer version but is still very entertaining
B00005MM67|5.0|Absolutely the best online dvd purchase ever. It is probably a rock climber's bias, but this is an outstanding movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey this app ik millions of people who would be devastated if this was gone so never get ride of this
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Keeps you thinking. &amp; very entertaining. I like the variety of games and that you don't have 2 continue  over &amp; over to win the game.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Cannot really give a review of this product, because this and a couple more that I downloaded say that the files have been corrupted and will not install......Disappointed with Amazon. :(
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I had the free version for awhile but would always end up clicking the advertisement at the bottom instead of the snooze button...which proved to be very annoying when just woken up! Lol! I purchased the paid version and have NO complaints or issues!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Most awesome games ever I like and  friends do to simply love it I give it five stars bright ones
B004VMUS9G|4.0|First of all, I love this app and would highly recommend it to anyone. I had the free version for awhile but the advertisement would always pop up just as the snooze button did and I'd end up hitting the ad instead, sending me to my Browser while the alarm continued to beep, which proved to be very annoying! I finally purchased the paid version and have had no issues!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun app. great when I have time to kill. lots of different games and you have something to work for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I'm so addicted to it I play it every day before and after school and sometimes I even play in the morning and at night before I go to bed..
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett has put together a sweeping story of the twentieth century and continues his main characters from the Fall of Giants.<br />Winter of the World begins in the 1920's and traces the Williams, Fitzherbert, Dewar and Peshkov families through Stalin's Russia, the rise of Hitler and the outbreak and completion of WWII.<br />It is an easy read, not always riveting, but, interest in the characters sustains the reader.<br />Follett, like all good historical novelists, juxtaposes historical figures and situations with his primary characters.<br />Class, racial and political differences are explored.<br />War, espionage and global issues interact with love affairs, family struggles and personal triumphs and failures.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The reviews raved about this book so I couldn't resist purchasing it. It was very readable, but not a complicated plot. I felt the characters were abit shallow and the storyline was quite light weight. All the same I did spent most of my waking hours reading it. Not in the league of Fifty Shades though which was totally awesome.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|The graphics are very good and the storyline not bad. Gameplay could a bit more challenging but if you're new to this type of adventure, it's a good starter. Thank you icoolgeeks for not using the \\"hidden object \\" format used by so many others to extend playtime of their games. Price is right for what get.<br />The most annoying part of the program is the delay between touching the screen and the action it causes. I'm playing on the Kindle Fire.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|I love Jo Nesbo books. He is such a good writer with his character Harry Hole really coming to life for me. It was great to go back in time and read the first H.H story, in fact how Harry became who he is in later books. Very clever of Jo Nesbo to write the first book a long time after his other books. Good story, intricate plot, clolourful characters, everything a good book should have.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Love Kate Morton and the mysteries that she unravels in her stories!  Definitely a book that you can read all day long!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Nice idea but it does not give you the option to play without using their music (or maybe I just didn't figure it out).
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I did not buy this at Amazon and this is not a review of the music on the CD therefore I still gave it 5 stars. But I wanted to let people know that Target has this CD with 4 extra songs: \\"Changing Colors\\", \\"Satellite\\", \\"Grazie\\" and \\"Play Me\\" for thirteen Dollars. Unfortunately I bought the Fan edition a month ago at Josh's web site for almost forty dollars and got one less song than the Target edition. I now have two CD's but I'm hoping I can return the Fan CD (It's still might cost me shipping both ways so I'll see). Bad marketing because I'm not much of a fan anymore. I know I'll feel better later on but for now I don't even want to listen to his new CD (which I received in the mail today). I love his music normally but I'm really disappointed.  I'll return after listening to the CD and update my review.
0670026603|5.0|me before you  a most excellent 5 star read!<br /><br />I love this book! I loved it from the second page!<br /><br />27 year old Louisa Clark still lives at home with her family who she helps support.<br />She has been going out with the same man for 7 years with no future plans. She feels adrift.<br />When she loses her job waitressing at The Buttered Bun Tea Shop, she is desperate and takes a job as caretaker to a quadriplegic man.<br />She wonders why with no experience she is even given the job, that is until she meets him.<br />Will Traynor was once an adventure junkie, traveling the world in lavish style. But Since his devastating accident he has been angry & mean, much to the angst of his family who had tried everything to get him to \\"live again\\".<br />louisa finds she is more babysitter than nurse. Will is angry and in constant pain. Lou tries everything she can think of to tempt him to return to his old life.<br />Slowly Lou & Will become close, fall in love and through funny, sad mishaps and escapades Louisa thinks she has finally gotten to him, until she finds out his desire to end his life.<br /><br />This really hit home for me because my family's nickname for me growing up was \\"kavorki Annie\\" (haha, for Jack Kevorkian) Let me explain... while growing up I was always the one who took our elderly, sick and dying animals, of which there were many, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, ducks, gerbils, chameleons, fish, bunnies ect. to the vet and inevitably I would be the one who would have to choose to euthanize them or not when needed.<br />As devastating as this was for me, I could not bear to see them be in pain or suffer at all, and my opinion is that people who do are actually thinking more of themselves than their beloved pet who can not speak for themselves, nor understand pain. Just my opinion people.<br />I cried & laughed throughout this book, called friends to tell them to go out and buy it as they would not regret it and neither will you!<br />Even though the premise has been done before, it has not been done like this. This is a book worth reading and passing on to a pal.ough the premise has been done before, it has not been done like this. This is a book worth reading and passing on to a pal.
0525425764|3.0|I like John Grisham and most of his books. This would be a great book for the younger generation. Well written for them.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|my granddaughter was so surprised when she got this movie and she really loves it and watches it over and over again thanks
B002MQYOFW|3.0|this was a good book but everyone is treating it with high reviews for being original. Has anyone not seen Battle Royal? It is a better story than battle royal but not such a new theme. I liked it but it wasn't the best or worst I've read.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|another great movie my granddaughter loves and watches over and over again she was very surprised to get it.  thanks
B002QE3CTY|4.0|this book was confusing at time due to the main character not knowing what was going on, but it was a fun read. I look forward to the next ones. This kept you wondering the whole way and details were far and few between.
0307887448|5.0|I started this book, and could not put it down.<br /><br />If you are a nerd, a geek, a gamer, or if you are related to or dating one, get this book.  It's like Harry Potter for adults.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|lags a little at times but overall I really like it! wish it wasn't so hard to get coins and all the other \\"stuff\\".
0385344333|5.0|I love jack reacher I would recommend it to everyone especially those who love a good thriller you never know where reacher will take you
B005USZML4|3.0|Just started reading this book and I like it. I only hope it lets me know what happen to Theo when he reported back to school after the judge declared a miss trail.
034580404X|2.0|it seemed too much like a fairy tale  if I recommended it to anyone it would be to young women who still believe in fairy tale love
B005USZYDU|5.0|I liked this book a lot, but not too happy about the ending. I am now reading the next Theodore Boone book, so maybe I'll get some clarification on the Kit Lawyer ending.
0345533054|5.0|I cant think of enough good things to say about this book everybook about jack reacher is a winner hands down
B0072GPQNG|4.0|kept in suspence and all ways looking forward to see what they had in store for us . tear jerking ending when they found each other in an all most impossible situation.
044024367X|5.0|another winner for lee child I love jack reacher  you never know where its taking you until you get there I would recommend this book to everyone who loves a good thriler
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Compulsive reading.Unusual story line and scenario. Equally unusual setting is well described and enables reader to visualise that which is unfamiliar.
B005BGBPBG|2.0|I read the book first. The movie didn't give the depth needed to understand why the characters behaved the way they did. That is often the case but in this instance it really hurt the storytelling.
B002R88G4U|5.0|Very well written, humourous and with colourful & likeable characters. The use of the series of letters is a novel concept.
0811876373|5.0|Excellent cake pop recipe book- - it has the cutest ideas and directions to make the cake pops!!!  Very creative ideas!!!

B000VZYPB4|5.0|Okay - Really who doesn't like the Big Bang Theory?  When the show first started I have to admit I thought it was silly.  But, through the years I have realized it is one of the funniest shows on TV.
B00701897I|5.0|Great movie - wonderful story.  Love it in 3D - sharp and clear.  This was fun for the whole family!
B0038NN3B4|2.0|The book itself is good.  Atkins has come a long way since the diet was first introduced many years ago.  But, I first purchased the Kindle version when I could not find a hard copy in my city.<br />Although all of the information is the same on the Kindle as it is in a hardback - for me it is difficult to navigate this kind of book on an e-reader.<br />I have since purchased the hard copy and find it much, much better.  I can mark the pages, go back and forth to what I need, make copies, etc.<br />Don't get me wrong - I love my Kindle and use it on a very regular basis.  For me, though, there are just some books I want in my hands - not on a screen.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Excellent case for my kindle fire hd.  The Kindle clips right in securely and it was extremely easy to use!  God product and excellent price!

B005CRPB0U|5.0|A pretty good book and great stories in it I would recommend it too who's reading this<br />My favorite storie was the fountain of fair fortune
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever is the coup de grâce of the Fever series. An absolute masterpiece! It is the culmination of this series where all of your important questions will be answered and you'll be left feeling complete. I had my doubts on whether Moning would be able to wrap up Mac's story in a little under 600 pages. After having experienced heart palpitations and shortness of breath after every cliff hanger ending for 4 books this one made it all worthwhile. This has to be the best ending to any series that I have ever read! I'm left feeling appeased but wanting to read the whole series all over again and I just finished it only days ago!<br /><br />There is never a dull moment in this finale. I was dreading reading a book this size but when all was said and done, I wouldn't have even noticed a few extra hundred pages. The Fever is like a drug; I got completely lost in it and never wanted it to end. This book is a doozy! We find out who Mac is, what Barrons is, who Vlane really is, how the Sinsar Dubh escaped, and the list goes on! Everything that has had you pulling your hair out for the last four books is revealed. Maybe you saw some of them coming but for the most part you probably had no idea. At least, I know that I sure didn't! But they all make sense, the dots connect beautifully. It's rare for a series to be able to completely tie up all of the lose ends and to leave the reader feeling satisfied but Karen Marie Moning pulls it off. I should have known better than to doubt her skill!<br /><br />The story starts off running and doesn't stop until the final page. The mystery behind the cliff hanger ending of Dreamfever is revealed but in true Moning fashion, she does make you wait a chapter or two. Mac 5.0 is the solution to stopping the Fae from destroying the world. It took four books, many trial and errors, and an iron will but she's finally up to the task. I loved experiencing the journey with her and couldn't imagine it having gone any other way. For the first part of this series she was sick of everyone using her and telling her what to do but in this final installment she actually turns to others to make tough decisions for her and they refuse. They offer advice and guidance but leave the ultimate decisions to Mac. She makes some tough calls but they're good ones overall even though they may not seem like it at the time. I never had many questions when it came to Mac. Sure, we don't know who her birth mother is (yet) but other than that she was the only character in this series who wasn't a mystery. That certainty is thrown out the window in this book. She goes through so many possible origins that it'll have you questioning all of the previous books. Fortunately, all is revealed in the end.<br /><br />Shadowfever was so good that it deserves a 5++ on my rating scale. Yes, it's THAT good! But it's only that good because of the four other books that came before it and the build-up to the end so don't cheat and read this one first. They're meant to be savored. Try and read them slowly if you can, otherwise you'll be stuck like me with the urge to read them all again. Or maybe everyone feels that way... I'm sad to be moving away from the Fever onto other books but the ending did hint that there may be more to come. Perhaps an offshoot series with another character as the lead? One can only hope! Thanks for the wild ride Karen Marie Moning, it's been a pleasure!of this series she was sick of everyone using her and telling her what to do but in this final installment she actually turns to others to make tough decisions for her and they refuse.

1419705849|5.0|I enjoyed this and then passed it to my 12 year old grandson. He read it in 1 night and then passed it around his 7th grade classroom. We have enjoyed many laughs discussing the happenings mentioned in this book. It's a great conversation starter! We are looking forward to the next!
0553573403|4.0|If you've turned on your television at all in the last couple of months I'm sure that you've heard of A Game of Thrones. After getting hooked on the first season of the HBO TV series, I just had to find out for myself whether or not the book is better than the show. I was actually really surprised by how close the script is to George R.R. Martin's original story. The only downside about reading the book after having watched the first season is how the actors immediately become the faces of the story. It sort of spoils a bit of the imaginative fun but regardless, if you love sword fights, dragons and political intrigue then you'll fall head over heels for this series!<br /><br />Martin's writing style is detailed, historical in nature and enthralling. The latter being an extremely good thing seeing how each book is over 800 pages long. The world that he begins to create in this first installment is masterfully crafted and larger than life. I know a few of you will get mad at this comparison but I thought it was similar in a lot of ways to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series. My guy doesn't read books. Period. Yet he's probably read Tolkien's books over a dozen times and is quickly burning through the A Song of Ice and Fire series as well. That's all the proof that I need! This book has maps and appendixes full of each family's lineage galore. This is not just a story that you're stepping into but a whole universe.<br /><br />The characters are so intricately developed and diverse that you'll be hard-pressed to pick a favorite. Not only that, but the line between good and bad is constantly shifting. A character might initially appear to be a good guy but then you learn one of their deep dark secrets and it completely changes the dynamic. I went from hating someone to loving them and then back again more times than I can count. I also like that Martin keeps it real by killing off a character or two, that up until that point, I thought was going to play a significant role in this series over the long haul. A Game of Thrones is about war and the author doesn't sugar coat it by giving out happily ever afters like party favours. Did I mention that there's six direwolves in this story? I'm head over heels in love with these creatures!<br /><br />The only downside (and upside) of this book is the sheer epicness of it all. There are so many details and the language is old school; not exactly the lightest reading material out there. After 800+ pages of that you can't help but feel like reading this book is a chore at times. My only recommendation is to pace yourself. A Game of Thrones is well worth your time; it's finding enough of it to be able to read this massive book that's the challenge. You can always cheat and just watch HBO but you know as well as I do that eventually you'll break down and read this series because after all, nothing's ever as good as the book!e in this series over the long haul.

B004GXA5U2|5.0|Awesome book, easy to read, funny - better than the movie!  Would recommend to others and would read again myself!
0553579908|4.0|The second installment of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series is even bloodier than the first. Although, this book is very different than A Game of Thrones it's still just as spellbinding. All hell has broken loose in the seven kingdoms and there are now five kings fighting for the Iron Throne. I found that HBO didn't stick quite as closely to the original story this time around so if you want the real scoop you'll have to bite the bullet and read all 761 pages of A Clash of Kings. I expect that this will continue to be the case for future season's because Martin's books keep getting longer and longer. Discouraged? I hear that the audio books are quite good and help make the descriptive writing and old school language easier to digest.<br /><br />I immensely enjoyed all of the war games that are played in book 2. Battle tactics aren't as straightforward as you might think. I was especially impressed by Tyrion Lannister's cunning. He sets the beginnings of his plan in motion early on and at first you can't help but wonder what the heck he is doing. When his elaborate scheme finally comes together towards the end it only makes his actions all the more clever. I never thought that my favorite A Song of Ice and Fire character would be a dwarf but there you have it! It's still early in the series to say for sure but I'm really diggin' Tyrion's wit and sly ways. Plus, he tells Cersei and Joffrey where to stick it on several occasions. There's just something hilariously funny about a dwarf not only standing up to his royal family but actually winning his arguments and making them look bad. I can't wait for the rest of his story!<br /><br />The format of this book is consistent with that of its predecessor. Each chapter is named after a character and follows their role in the war. In my opinion, there's good things and bad things to be said about this style of writing. I like that readers get inside of each character's head and that the point of view is constantly changing. There's never a dull moment! However, it can also cause quite a bit of confusion; especially when a character hasn't made an appearance for 50 chapters. After a while you start to forget where you last left them which caused me to feel frustrated at times. I hate having to backtrack while reading. The lengthy descriptions and old dialect are also trying at times. This isn't a book to read when the kids are screaming for dinner and the TV is blaring. It requires your full attention otherwise you're going to miss a few crucial details and ultimately end up lost.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings isn't for the faint of heart. This story is overflowing with betrayal, violence and rape. These are the realities of war after all. I'm hoping that the next book focuses more on what's happening beyond the wall. I'm dying to learn more about the paranormal aspects of this fantasy series. War and politics make for a great story but I want to know about the Others, white walkers, dragons and the children of the forest. Let the kings fight amongst themselves for a while and bring on the big bads!tantly changing. There's never a dull moment!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was very good, now reading another book by same author.<br />Very easy reading and i really enjoyed it .
B0002TJGQS|4.0|I ordered these for all around general use.  They arrived OK and on checking them out,<br />I found most of them in good condition, but one of the batteries was completely dead.<br />Considering the price, for general use - - I guess you can't really beat the price, etc.

0783226063|4.0|This futuristic film is set in the year 10,381, in a universe oriented around a spice found only on the planet Dune. Among its many attributes, the spice \\"folds\\" space and enables travelers access to any destination without actually moving. The dynamics of the story explodes with realistic graphics, special effects, and outstanding performances by Jose Ferrer, Patrick Stewart, Max Van Snydow, and Sean Young. Kyle MacLachlan plays the warrior that will rise to an inter-planetary leadership role but not without the aid of Linda Hunt.<br /><br />It is the story of a world beyond time and space.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter thinks a rely awesome game.  ITS AWESOME THAT YOU CAN PLAY WHEN THE LIKES GO OUT AT BEDTIME.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Well this movie is just BEYOND AWESOME. Why? Because Tim Burton is amazing and he always creates the best stuff! I watch Frankenweenie like all the time! Awesome flippin movie. Whoever hasn't seen it then you need to see it NOW. If you don't like Tim Burton then there's something wrong with you. :]
0802473156|5.0|Absolutlly love the book and will give to all engaged couples and have give to many of my  friends  as gifts
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I had heard of this book, and it sounded interesting. I am now reading it, and it is terrifically interesting...describing such things as how monks in monasteries were required: to know how to read; to be totally silent while doing so (and developed hand signals to show whether they wanted to read a sacred, a secular or a Greek or Roman text); to allow (at the librarian's discretion) guests to read their books, scrolls, and codices, and so on. Poggio's search for ancient texts during the Renaissance led him to monasteries such as the one in Fulda in Germany, where he discovered texts preserved, but little read, since the early years C.E. Stephen Greenblatt, who is also a Shakespeare scholar, has presented Poggio's search in a very engaging style. Many bits of information, such as the libraries discovered at Herculaneum, preserved in part (much was incinerated by the volcanic eruption that also inundated the town), but providing proof that individuals also had reading rooms and libraries in their private homes. Wow! Greenblatt offers views into many parts of what is now ancient society.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I spent hours looking around the house for a calculator the other day only to find the batteries were dead! Now I will never have to worry about that again.. I love that it's large enough to see clearly and always in my reach. Thank you..

B008HT4FUW|5.0|We love the series and got this not only to watch a few of the episodes we had not paid close attention to, but also to share with family members. They too are now in love with the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game very addictive and I can't put it down. Graphics are nice and crisp and challenges are great fun
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm a quilter and originally bought this game because it looks like a quilt.  Once I started playing it became very addictive.  How fun is combining your hobby with a fun game.  Had no problems downloading and began playing immediately.  I just hope I can put it down long enough to do some quilting.  Get it now.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Reading some of the recent reviews about remastering issues, I don't think they got this new 2013 version, even if they did the Auto-Rip, which I think pulled the 1987 issue without the bonus tracks.  I ordered the CD which came today and played it in my car.  In comparison to the 1987 release, which was not remastered properly (with hiss and low volume), this new version is pristine and includes two bonus tracks not issued when recorded.  I also did not know this album was started in 1973.  I thought it was done in the moment for the February 1976 release.<br /><br />Great care was taken with the remaster to bring all the music to an almost-live level of sound.  There is great separation of instruments. Strings literally sing along with Barbra's voice.  This was one of the only classical recordings I owned, though as I grew older, added some of the composers to my collection and the great classical crossover artists of recent years (Sarah Brightman, Katherine Jenkins, Mario Frangoulis, etc).  I also learned for audition pieces back in the day and trained with my vocal coach using Barbra's version of Beau Soir, which is the only lyric in French I can do without error.  Otherwise, it is Oui, Merci and croissant.<br /><br />This album was a total surprise to me being re-released.  Kudos to all involved for really making it a superb edition and shining it all up with the remastering.  \\"I Love You\\" is currently playing and it never sounded this good.  A \\"MUST\\" for all Barbra fans.<br /><br />Great album for quiet times, candlelight, and/or brunch!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I found this hard to control the pac man. He didn't follow my finger as precise as I would have liked.
B006VP1OYO|5.0|This collection is perfect from start to finish. Nice to see that a few of the unreleased songs have been included. Can't recommend enough, every track is a winner.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|fun game, some very challenging levels. Wish there were some way to get hints besides earning them. I've earned all the achievements and I still have levels I can't pass and no way to get a hint
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead isn't just about zombies, or walkers. It's about survival, faith and loyalty. The series examines the inner nature of humankind and what we are capable of in desperate times.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|never played it much, didn't really get into it. I never played it enough to give it an honest review
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|My son loves this game is pretty cool too cause i like play it too.<br />You start from one level to the next as it gets harder and harder
B00884GR0W|2.0|I didn't like this game. I found it very confusing and very hard to control where you moved. I didn't quite understand what you were to do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever<br />if you love temple run you will love this one more<br />you can zipline and drive mines
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Alot like Temple Run 1 but better. I like the new features and more challenging course. My 4 yr old grand son is a whiz at this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This an awesome game especially if you like building with your friends I like that you can join in on your friends game to help them must bye app.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very different and challenging. Some levels really make you think.There are a few levels I have not been able to pass
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is perfect for everyone... if you're crafty person just use craft mode (where you can do whatever you want with all the blocks) or if you're more of a gamer you can use survival mode (where you kill zombies and animals and have to collect blocks to survive)
0061703257|5.0|I was not prepared for the ending.  Saw the movie and the ending was sad.  I still have the book in my library and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a fast pace, edge of your seat book.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Good game, but as soon as I paid for it,  the app won't load! It would get a better rating if it worked!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is for lack of a better word Amazing. I was looking for something that was short and engaging, and found both and then some in this book. It hooks from the beginning and does not turn you loose until the end. Buy it, I promise you'll love it.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Worth watching, it’s always a good time for the family to watch and laugh. I’m sure this one will become a great Christmas comedy for sure.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Loved by our super granddaughter.  We had watched the live show and sung along with the CD but the DVD is great.
B00884GR0W|5.0|If you like the Minecraft block type world, but are not satisfied with PE or all the clones; give this one a spin.  The graphics are just stunning, extremely surprising considering it is a block world.  A large portion of the game is  NOT blocks such as NPC's, animals, torches, mobs, the sky and much more. Huge variety of docile and aggressive animals and mobs. If you like RPG's then you will feel right at home.  Tons of different types of blocks to build a city, a castle, or just a house.  Many different graphic tweaks that can be used to take advantage of your fast tablet or your slow phone.  There is just so much more to see and do.  Check this game out, you won't regret it.  It's under $2.00 now and it is under-priced.  This game is worth far more then that.
B0015AARJI|5.0|original el color que pedi , el producto en perfecto estado, llego a tiempo, el precio muy bueno , lo recomiendo
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like this book a lot, the best book of all his novels. I personally think this one is better than notebook. It is more realistic and really intense. I was thinking to watch the movie, however the trailer turned me off. This book is not only about love, it involves with a lot of things, family, crime, corruption, friendship, and abuse. You won't feel disappointed if you read this book.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I had bought about 7 characters only to wake up and find my characters had disappeared...this app is fun, but it really bothered me that I spent all that time earning those characters only to have them vanish. 1 *
B004TIKXCE|5.0|how did this guy from way back know so much.<br />To my amazement, many of his thoughts are applicable to todays world.<br />Wish every one of our Government leaders read this book......daily!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Entertaining movie with good music.<br />Rebel Wilson is outstanding.<br />Good fun movie that everyone will enjoy<br />worth getting a copy
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This is a great book. I laughed, I cried, and I fell I love with each character in this book. I am excited about reading the second book.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app and it had not worked yet.  It was so frustrating because I have a toddler and she had a small breakdown when I told her she couldn't play after we waited for the download to complete.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I have 3 boys (2,5,7) they enjoy this movie and so do I and my husband. Nice to have something we can watch together with a moral lesson thrown in as a bonus.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Something to keep the cold nights warm. Great humor and not cookie cutter from other sit coms instead very original.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I found this book after seeing mentions of it on tumblr and I absolutely loved it. The two characters were funny and brilliant and tear-jerking.
B007REV4T8|1.0|After selecting Skyfall and being directed to the view page, i was notified that the HD version could not be played via my computer and a link for the standard version THAT SENDS YOU TO A PAGE THAT SAYS NOT WORKING AFTER BEING CHARGED FOR THE VIEWING!!! If anyone finds out what the frack the problems is and if a refund was offered please let the rest of us know.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. It combines the mystery of circus with the secrecy of the era. The characters were intriguing and full of depth. Beautifully written prose and underlying concepts.
B003X27L9U|5.0|I loved to view the world by Jack's eyes. Great book to reflect how we see the outside an the inside.
044654759X|4.0|Nicolas Sparks is my favorite romance novelist.  He weaves a charming story time after time.  This time is no exception.  Sometimes he takes a turn into left field, that I could do without but he always entertains me with his stories.  If you've never read him and you enjoy a good love story, I highly recommend his books to you.  This one was not his best but it was indeed good.  I liked it!  But then I always do like his writing.
B009AMALGM|2.0|It's not playing and it's only playing the previews And i cleaned it and still saying no play what can i do
B00B935SUY|5.0|Very excellent!!! Dave Grohl is a flippin genius ;) Full life and death of Sound City studios, he really outdid himself this time :)
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I really enjoyed John's book. He has a nice informal writing style that makes it easy to follow and enjoy. This is a great new concept for a growing segment of writers who publish on Amazon. I'm working hard to incorporate a lot of his concepts into my own marketing plan.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I mostly skim over the sex scenes..because frankly they're getting old..Yes we get it!! Great sex life..but the connection between Ana and Christian is amazing. It makes me melt. A terrific romance. If you enjoyed the first book, then you will this one as well
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Disc no 2 on Season 3 is defective.  The disc would stop, skip and just annoy me to death.  The Masterpiece is great, but caN I get my disc replaced?
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Five stars enough said. This guy can pitch a shut out every time and probably blindfolded. Just download the book and enjoy.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Fantastic film.  Unbelievable how many great, memorable albums all were recorded in the same studio.  I've already watched this twice and pre-ordered the soundtrack.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Thought provoking and fun. Imo too expensive; though this game gives more interactive episodes than other games, the price is too prohibitive for a three day game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It draws you in, and you can't stop reading. You hate to reach the end. Thankfully there's still a third book.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Very good application.  Is intuitive and the author has been good at adding features.  However,  is starting to show is age.  I would love to see JB notifications added,  Halo dark theme (not a fan of the UI just now),  and nested tasks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wasn't sure at first as I thought it was just another teenage love story but the more I read I found I couldn't put it down and was guessing what was going to happen next.  I would recommend that a tissue box be kept within reach towards the end.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I loved most of this story, when the action was is current time. It was hilarious. The earlier years, 40's, 50's, etc, which included world leaders in preposterous circumstances was not quite as enjoyable to me. Over all it is a fun read and one that I have already recommended to several friends who also liked it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the concept incased in this story. It is original, and I loved the clear and in depth exploration of Katniss and Peter and how their relationship. It was uncomplecated writting which made use of the 1st person narrative extremely well. I would reccomend this book to anyone.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|This novel, steeped in over-the-top old English, really just ends up being more of a chore to read than a leisurely activity. I prefer the motion picture, honestly.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read.  Adults and teens should read this book to understand what goes into the life of our most dedicated soldiers.  A great way to show teens the sacrifices that go into making a worthwhile life, regardless of your chosen profession.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|The sentence above says it all. I have loved these stories since I read them for the first time at age 11.<br />It is still a joy to read them.  If you are willing to tolerate egregious errors of spelling, punctuation and simple word processing, go for it. The price is right and in an era of monosyllabic writing, it is a pleasure to read an author who can use three syllable words and correct syntax.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I cant even describe them. My first pair unfortunately developed a crack in the hinge, so I RMA'd them and I have to say.... Logitech's customer service is AMAZING. They paid for my shipping label, I sent in my old headphones and just got the replacement pair today. I don't know if they just used new parts or something, but oh my GOD I don't remember them sounding this good, the bass is crisper than anything I've ever heard, the surround sound just blew my mind and I think these headphones have spoiled me a little. I can't put on another pair of headphones and even come close to how happy I am with these. And the best part? They're wireless. This is also the first review I've ever written, but just the fact that logitechs service was so damn good, and these headphones are awesome was enough for me to want to spread the word. I think everything I'm going to buy for my computer is going to be logitech from now on. annnnnnd now I'm gonna go back and watch tron again.
B00B92ZO3G|5.0|This short read condenses all the fascinating and surprising ideas found in Daniel Pink's book, To Sell Is Human. When picturing a person who sells, we usually come up with a sleazy car salesman, but in this age of information, this picture is inaccurate; not only are buyers more informed than ever, but the products being sold aren't necessarily exchanged for cash value. Instead, most people in their everyday jobs, which don't include \\"sales associate\\" in the title, are selling something: they are persuading others to buy into their ideas or part with their resources, even if money itself isn't changing hands. Pink has demonstrated that selling is a fundamental human trait, and this summary takes the reader through the many ways that awareness of this is useful. You'll learn that empathy is invaluable in sales, and that the most effective pitches today are the abbreviated kind that open up dialogue rather than demanding closure.<br /><br />Honestly, this was an eye-opening, quick summary of how much we stand to benefit from embracing our inner salesman. Positive human traits, like realistic optimism, buoyancy, and a consideration of others are all making a comeback if this model of human behavior is believable, and that's a cause for celebration in the world today.

It does not feel cheap, and breakage seems like it would certainly only come from poor handling.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|See my review to Michael Jackson Live at Wembely 7.16.1988. I have the same thoughts and feelings about this as well.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|The movie played with great quality and audio. It's also a great movie to own, great story! I recommend any and everyone to watch it.
B00683JK9K|4.0|I read the previous reviews, then downloaded onto my Droid Incedible (first model =old). I played a puzzle to completion on the tiny screen, and didn't have any problems with function. The artwork is very lovely. Now I'm going to try it out on my Galaxy 2 tab.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good stuff. a little slow at times but fun for all ages I'm glad I downloaded it I try to play everyday its that good
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|loved it, well written and well acted - a rarity in movies these days. I might even rent it again.
1451638450|5.0|This is finally the book of Miles cousin's.  This is a comic love story with lots of intrigue!  I loved this book even though miles was only mentioned.  The book comes before the Count Mile's father death, before or during Cryoburn.  Excellent book.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|The movie is like a puddle that pretends to be a sea.<br /><br />The plot is simple, though it does not mean that simple plots go with bad movies. It's just a fact that the plot is not that sophisticated:<br /><br />The main character tells a writer a long story with a promise that after hearing it, the writer will believe in God. So the storyteller tells how he survived a disaster at sea, sailing in a boat with a Bengal tiger. At the end of the story the teller suddenly says that it was not true and tells an alternative, more scarier story of his survival without the tiger. Then the teller asks the writer which story he prefers. The writer chooses the first story, with the tiger. And the teller says that it goes with God. As simple as that.<br /><br />I'm surprised that the movie's budget was 150 mil. Where is the money? In 3D and visual effects? Do they call it movies nowadays? For me, a good movie is a well-told story, not a show of technical progress. I wanted to see a story of a spiritual odyssey, personal growth, how the main character loses or obtains his faith, how a boy becomes a man, but it was all so shallow that I feel cheated.<br /><br />Why should someone believe in God if he listens to the story? Why does the first story go with God and why can't the second story go with God? What's wrong with it? Does the author mean that believing in good sweet stories means to have faith? Is God just a palatable story that people choose to believe? Why does the truth must be something that one choose to believe in? Why does the boy start believing in 3 religions and finish at the same level? He does not change, does not growth, doesn't question his faith.<br /><br />Was he searching for God? He was but where is his journey? He is not an \\"enlightened\\" person but still the same naïve young boy, a flat cartoon character all the time. He starts as a naïve believer and ends up as a naïve believer, no lapses, no temptations, and no spiritual growth. Did he \\"surrender\\"to God? So what? It does not make the story more intelligent or spiritual, or less cooked up and artificial.<br /><br />I do not want to choose neither story because I do not like them both. Neither story proves anything for me. To me, it's mainly a story about how a boy tamed a tiger sailing in one boat. The rest - so called \\"layers\\" and allegories are nonsense, attempts to add depth to look wise and philosophical but in fact, it's just a substitute of a true spiritual journey. It's an ersatz spirituality taught by an ersatz guru.<br /><br />A friend of mine asked me who I think Richard Parker (the tiger) was in fact? I have no idea. It's an open-ended question. There are no right or wrong answers, I guess. The answer that one believes is \\"true\\" - must be the true answer for the believer. It could be the tiger, it could be the boy (since he had known the tiger since the Zoo times), it could be God or personal relationships of God and the boy, it could be the boy's animal nature, it could be his relative, it could be the cook (why not?), it could be just a fruit of the boy's imagination, or Yann Martel (the author) himself, or it could mean<br />all things together at the same or different time.<br /><br />There is a chance that none story is real, so it's hard to explore Martel's mind and tell what he meant creating the puzzle. I do not think that Martel is a fool but when I'm thinking of the movie, I am recalling this Italian saying: \\"A fool can ask more questions than seven wise men can answer.\\" Well, I can also ask more questions than seven wise men can answer, but I do not pretend to be smart.<br /><br />Like it or not, to me the story sounds fake, artificial, and cartoon-like. It's a beautiful 3D postcard as flat as it is, not a true spiritual odyssey with trials, ordeals, and temptations.<br /><br />Talking about personal journeys and spiritual growth, I prefer The Odyssey.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004YAEB6Q THE ODYSSEY (1997) Armand Assante, Gretta Scacchi DVD]]<br /><br />PS If you enjoyed the movie and did not find my review helpful, could you please answer a few questions and explain your point of view?<br /><br />I am a Christian. I believe in omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing), and omnipresent (existing everywhere at once, always present) God. You may have different beliefs. Hold on them and try to look at the story without its beautiful visual effects.<br /><br />Suppose, an illegal immigrant's boat sank somewhere in Florida and the<br />illegal immigrant was saved by the US Coast Guard. The guardsmen who are<br />atheist, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, and Christian ask the guy, \\"What<br />are you doing here? Are you American?\\" And the immigrant says, \\"Chill out,<br />guys! After hearing my story, you will believe in God.\\" And he starts<br />telling them how he survived 227 days after a shipwreck, sailing in the boat<br />together with a crocodile, a cat, and a dog. He suffered a lot. The<br />crocodile ate the dog and the cat. There was no food. To survive, the<br />illegal immigrant had to learn fishing and even tame the beast. Then there was a<br />storm. The immigrant surrendered to God and together with the crocodile<br />reached the US coast where the crocodile escaped.<br /><br />Will the guardsmen believe the story? Of course, not. They will ask the<br />illegal immigrant to stop bulls***ing them and tell them the real story. So<br />the illegal immigrant tells them another story, where he sailed in the boat<br />together with a criminal who killed his two friends, other illegal<br />immigrants. The guardsmen say, \\"Another bulls***, but we can't prove which<br />story is real.\\" The immigrant says, \\"It's your problem. But if you<br />prefer the first story, you must know that it goes with God.\\"<br /><br />Questions: Will the atheist guardsmen believe in God after hearing the story? How will the immigrant's story prove them the existence of God? Why does the first story go with God and what's wrongwith the second? Why can't the second story prove the existence of God? Will the first story support the beliefs of the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian guardsmen?.. Thanks.

B00A81MV3U|3.0|I find Silver Linings Playbook unbelievable, shallow, and spurious.<br /><br />The plot seems to be interesting, but far fetched details, scenes, and dialogue spoil the movie.<br /><br />The main character with bipolar disorder leaves a mental hospital, gets back home, and starts looking for his wife who betrayed him with a school teacher. The guy's family and friends try to prevent them from the meeting. But he loves his wife and wants to get her back. (His main problem is not his illness, but that he struggles to hold for his past love). Then he meets a girl who has mental problems too. For no reason she falls in love with him and tries to do everything to keep him. Looks like it's a great chance for the guy to get rid of his \\"ghost\\", start his life anew and have a new love, but he is still holding for his past love, his wife. He shows no interest in the \\"crazy girl\\". The crazy girl is trying to teach him dancing and reveal some the difference between them and normal people, so at the end when he meets his wife, he decides to let her go. He is not cured, but he accepts his new love and new life.<br /><br />The acting was good, not great, especially for DeNiro, but okay for a 3rd grade film. Story? I do not buy it. It looks like some \\"sane\\", smart people wrote a script about \\"insane\\" people to make big bucks on the topic and maybe get an Oscar. I do not mind main characters with mental problems, but why do the authors push forward the idea that mentally disable people are more frank, sincere, and \\"real\\" than normal? Isn't it a stereotype? They show his friends and even elder brother as jerks who did not care about him while he was in the hospital. But he has a big heart and loves everyone anyway. It's okay, but why such a bias? So that the audience to love the character and feel sorry for him and at the same time - feel guilty for their own inattentiveness? The trick it too cheap. Some details and dialogues sound fake too, it's a pure fantasy of the authors who tried to imagine how mentally disable people can speak and what they can discuss. He asks her if she slept with a woman, and voila, she did. And she even sat on the woman's laps. What a coincidence! And it's not the only one. The Philadelphia Eagles win every time when the characters are together... What a sign!<br /><br />At the end the authors tried to repeat the success of Little Miss Sunshine, including one of the messages: \\"They lost, but they won.\\" Come on, be more original. I have seen it before. If you want to copy, make your copy better than original. Make catharsis more powerful, real, without fake tears of joy.<br /><br />Gimmicks, cheap tricks, and cheap laughs make the movie far fetched, unbelievable, and shallow. It struggles to pretend to be funny, meaningful, heartfelt, and touching, but tries too hard, so ends up to be predictable, boring, and fake. It's an imitation, gilded, not gold. IMHO.

1401937268|5.0|This is a variation of the normal tarot, a reinterpretation of the same. I am not a Tarot expert, so this does not matter to me. I actually, prefer the Air, Fire, Water and Earth themes. I love the fact that there is a summary of the meaning of the card written on the same, which makes it very convenient for intuitive quick readings or to use it for your daily oracles. The companion mini-book is also very helpful.<br /><br />The artwork is fantastic, and the colours amazing. The back image of each card is truly beautiful, and the borders are in a shiny silver. Truly a de-luxe deck.<br /><br />The cards shuffle well, but the deck being a big big in size, the shuffle can be challenging if you have small hands, like me.
141659521X|5.0|I suspect that there is a little of Mitch Rapp in a good many of us males even considering our inbred sensitivity.  I would not be surprised that women also find him &#34;interesting&#34; as well. This is a thriller novel like all the other Mitch Rapp novels.  It holds your attention from the first page because of its excellent character and story development.  I have read many other Vince Flynn novels.  They are all great reads, and I'm looking forward to his next.  To tell the truth, probably in a year or so I'll reread some of his books.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a selfish and cynical weatherman sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for a fluff piece about Groundhog Day. He is boorish, as always, to his pretty producer Rita (Andie MacDowell), cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and all the local people he meets. When an unexpected snowstorm hits, something very strange happens. Everyone is acting as if February 3rd is Groundhog Day. As it turns out, Phil is living the same day over and over again.<br /><br />Groundhog Day is an celluloid example of a grand idea with magnificent execution. This film manages to capture real life cynicism and, its frequent companion and twin, hope with charm and elan. Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy with actual entertainment, romance and comedy as well as a covertly profound and sagacious reflection on life. It all begins with the clever premise. It is not the first time warp story nor heartwarming piece of magical realism. Still, taking an obscure semi-holiday and tying it in with a man facing an inexplicable purgatory in a pleasant, if banal, little town is a fascinating premise and this is just the starting point for the script. The protagonist, Phil Connors has the bright, pop-culture infused snark of the typical  Bill Murray character but he is a rather malevolent jerk. Once he finds himself in this bizarre predicament, there are some well-planned and very clever situational humor as he becomes semi-immortal. Murray's performance in Groundhog Day is fantastic. He combines physical humor with the tragedy and comedy this story requires. In recent years, Murray has deservedly received more credit and acclaim as a thespian with films like Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers and Moonrise Kingdom, but I would assert that this was his cinematic bravura. Bill Murray as Phil Connors is reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin.<br /><br />Stephen Tobolowsky is great as a gadfly insurance salesman who frequently bumps into Phil as he follows the same pattern every single day. MacDowell is charming as the idealistic, playfully demure woman Phil pines for. Phil can learn about her and try to condition himself as a perfect match with each passing/repeated day. This provides for a funny scene where he learns her favorite drink, then the next day what she toasts to and why, and so on. What is profound are the ideas of time and change in our lives this film plays with? Phil spends years in this purgatory mastering various arts as his personality slowly changes. What if our lives were transformed in similar fashion (minus the fantastical time loop, of course)? With Groundhog Day, Harold Ramis, along with Danny Rubin, wrote and crafted an incredibly clever, endearing and fun film that re-creates and outdoes the Frank Cappra-style of a film like It's a Wonderful Life.is charming as the idealistic, playfully demure woman Phil pines for.

0385344333|1.0|A total waste of my time ! I couldn't believe how slow and boring this book was. I had to force myself to keep going on, and on, and on, and on. I'm an insomniac who needs ambien to fall asleep. This book worked better than any sleeping pill ever could ! Most of the time I had trouble seeing the printed words. That's because my eyes were filled with tears of boredom.  A lot of people said don't buy this just pick it up at the library. I can't even recommend doing that. Don't waste your time.  P.S  This was BAD !!!
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|I was expecting this to be an ok film and I was pleasantly surprised. The overall story is not unique (high school outcast/angst), but I think it is told in a slightly different way. Definitely worth a watch.

Pattinson is excellent and has proven he has no difficulties carrying an entire film despite lower box office scores ~ when you only release in a handful of cities, you're not going to make billions but that's no fault of the actor(s).  Brilliant movie ~ 5 stars!!!

Its simple enough so not to frustrate  you, but not so easy that you get bored. :-) So far i havent come across any bugs,  which is super rare with any of these games. The only thing that could be considered a problem is the amount of space it takes up on your device. But i definitely  give this game a five star rating.

This is one of those albums that you would think just came out, as it doesn't feel dated let alone 20 years old. The remaster is great, not a huge difference but just sounds cleaner, especially with a good set of headphones/buds. Highly recommend for your collection, and at the price point that I got it (2.99) it's silly not to pick it up!

Having a cameo performance by Sarandon as a 'normal' guy was wonderful. The effects were mind blowing and every performance was spot on. David Tennant's take on Roddy McDowell's character was such fun. If you didnt know the original, it was a great vampire movie; for those of us who went before, it was a new facet to a superb movie and hats off to the new edition. Great print; arrived quickly and well enough packaged that the battered exterior still protected the contents perfectly

B00B2JOJIM|3.0|First new single from Depeche Mode since 2009.  The song plays like a continuation of their sound from Sounds of the Universe: slower moving melodies and less fast paced synths than those found on Playing the Angel.  This isn't a bad thing, but it is the type of song that takes longer to grow on you than the hard hitting, catchy synth tunes that Depeche has been so known for over the years.  I'm a little displeased that they included the same album version of Heaven that will be on their upcoming album.  They could have changed it up with an alternate mix, radio edit, or single edit.  Out of the two CD singles for Heaven, I don't feel the normal single is worth it, as both Heaven (normal album version again) and the B-side, All That's Mine, will appear on the deluxe version of Delta Machine, so I'd save the few bucks and put it toward the full deluxe album.<br /><br />As far as the 4 remixes found on the maxi single, the dark techno sounds of Audion and Matthew Dear give the song a whole new edge and feel, and judging by the samples, I felt this would be the best out of the remixes.  I was wrong.  The Ollwe remix is the standout for me, featuring a deep house like groove with a touch of female vocal melody, courtesy of relatively unknown French synth-pop artist Owlle.  It's the perfect compliment to Dave's vocals and ever so slightly increases the pace and groove of the original song.  Remixers adding in their own vocals to songs has been a trend over the past few years, and I'm not sure it's ever been done with a Depeche Mode remix before.  Granted, Owlle does not sing any lyrics, it's just an \\"ohh-ohhh\\" sprinkled in the background, but it adds a unique touch to the song.  I'm torn between liking this version even over the original.  And I don't usually ever like DM remixes better than their single or extended versions.<br /><br />What brings the Maxi single down are the other two remixes, which quite frankly, would have been better left out.  Once you get the album with the same version of Heaven there, the only reason to revisit the maxi single are the Owlle and Matthew Dear remixes.  If you opt for the deluxe version of the full album, it will make the normal single redundant.

1400069289|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. First and foremost, I was pleased that it was written by an investigative journalist who knows how to cite his findings. Too often I  come across books that have a bunch of quack ideas that are largely left unsubstantiated. That really kills the reading experience for me.<br /><br />Secondly, the book taught me some things about habit formations that are very revealing into the working of the mind. The chapter on Neurology of Free Will sounded the trumpet for me. The patterns that exist in most people's lives are habits that we know exist and by consciously being aware of the CUE's that set off the habits, you an interfere and hamper any bad habit or manipulate a bad one into a good one. The theory is plausible and the practical implications of the theory also make sense. Unless you truly have a medical condition where your brain acts in ways even you can't control, any habit can be subject to change.<br /><br />The best part is the Appendix which sets a framework for the reader to apply principles in the book. It was not disingenuous advice because Mr. Duhigg states clearly that everyone's habits comes about differently and there is no one-fits-all approach to changing them.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking to change a habit and truly seek a better life. Along the way, you'll learn a good bit about what researchers, neurologists, statsticians and economists alike are learning about the human brain.
1603420398|5.0|This book has some very unique granny applications. In combination with some granny squares, these other shapes will make for some beautiful afghans.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is alot of fun. It is easy to play but still offers a challenge. My favorite part would be the multiplayer selection.
0307279189|1.0|How does such a bad writer get a bestseller? There was a lot of hype around this book so I finally tried reading it. It's so full of lies I wonder how it got published. Everything in it is ridiculously over done. So disappointing! I hope the Tarahumara have not suffered negatively due to this stupid book.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child is just great.  Look forward to more!  The Affair provides some interesting background on Jack Reacher's character.  Good read!

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Thought this was a good and cute read, kept me engaged and wanting to finish it. Would recommend it to those that like sweet love stories.
B000059PPX|5.0|Very nostalgic..and I was too young to see it. Some great cameos...too bad Eva disappeared off the face of the earth!
B003Y5H556|2.0|while this movie is prettty good this particular blu ray looks like the picture on front was badly redone and badly printed. i would buy this same movie from someone else!
B009GX6SSK|4.0|It's a good series and am enjoying it a great deal. As a fan i do recomend NCIS LA. Good character driven series

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love this box set, its got a great set up and has fun extras, really nice. Great price would buy again!
B008E77AEK|3.0|But still nothing brilliant.<br /><br />I gave Trojan Horse a chance after the disappointment of Zero Day, and I think my decision was right. Dissolving pulls together interesting threads, but the plot is still too formulaic,and the ending a little too convenient.<br /><br />The editing is definitely better this time around, which is good news.<br /><br />If there's a third Allen book I might still come back.<br /><br />2.5/5
B005LAII08|5.0|I love this movie and the short la luna is amazing. The 3D case is nice quality. i would buy again.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I loved the songs Rolling in the Deep, Set Fire To The Rain and<br />especially Someone Like You which makes me cry when I hear<br />it. Adele has such a beautiful voice that I never heard before<br />I see why she won grammys and sold millions of records.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I enjoy this show, the fairytale element is a lot of fun. the first season was defintly better than the second, but still cute.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I can see where this would bring comfort to the sick, and dying or even the bereaved. Having read other NDE literature, it's difficult to grapple with the way the story was given. The spiritual and scientific dichotomy just didn't resonate well. I think I would have preferred from purely scientific angle, even understanding how he tried to show their interconnectivity. In spite of which probably sounds like a negative review I did enjoy the book, my issue was aesthetics purely.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I love taylor swift annd while her first CD is her best one, this one didnt dissapoint. I would buy it again.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great next step in the series...really looking forward to the next installment of this series.  The books are an easy read and entertaining as well
B007TNS6JI|4.0|ya so dis game that is played by a person of the right caliber is quite entertaining and sometimes when i am home i play it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Heard about this series from some people who were watching the HBO series.  The books are very entertaining and a light, easy read.
0770433782|5.0|I have been ordering a lot of wedding books in anticipation of my daughter's wedding and this one has been the best so far. The pictures are AMAZING and the ideas are just what we've been looking for.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I cannot express in words how astonished I am by this powerful story. It casts riveting views into sex, love, misery and even heartache. I recommend this book to anyone who has witnessed love. Incredible truly incredible.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I remember loving the alien movies as a kid, at least Alien and Aliens for sure, 3 and 4 were good since they were still Alien like.  This one has a feel like the others but there was a bit of waiting for the big thing to happen, then waiting and waiting and when something did happen it lacked the punch I had wanted it to.  The movie is good but my pre conceved notions took a bit of my enjoyment away.  The graphics are awesome and the acting is pretty good though like other action movies there is a sceen or two that make you go &#34;How the hell are they still moving&#34;.  Over all, if you like Alien like things then you are set for a good little ride.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The book is excellent.  I'm not going to go into any detail about the story because many other reviewers have done so much better than I could.  My main issue that I would like people to be aware of is with the Kindle format. (Clearly the book deserves 5 stars regardless of the format on Kindle)<br /><br />The pages aren't numbered so it was impossible to tell where I was in the book until I reached the next chapter.  It showed percentages so I knew round-about where I was but not exacly.  This wouldn't have been a huge issue but a friend was also reading the same book and it was hard to figure out if we were close to the same spot when discussing it.  Neither of us wanted to give anything away.  It also made it very, very difficult to look at footnotes because they were at the end of each chapter.  Every time I scrolled forward to check them, I would have a hard time finding my spot based on the just percentage.  It would have been much, much nicer if the footnotes had been at the bottom of the page they were referring to.<br /><br />Like I stated before, these were mild irritations that in no way took away from my enjoyment of the book.  However, if I had realized how it was formatted ahead of time, I would have purchased the print copy.  I hope all of this made sense.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|A neat premise that I was fearing they were going to wimp out on since the theme is considered controversial now a days.  In our society of child worship the thought that in a dystopian future under aged people might have to fight for their lives is so foreign that few might understand the underlying ideas behind the story.  It is good to see an young adult book treating young adult minds like they are capable of understanding something deeper than talking sponges and interracial explorers.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|SEASON 5 HAS BEEN FOR ME A GREAT MIX OF ITS TRADEMARK WIT AND CHARM WITH THAT SATISFYING ELEMENT THAT IS THEIR FINALLY THERE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP. EACH EPISODE HAS BEEN FUN AND ENTERTAINING. HOPE THERE IS MANY MORE TO COME.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|The cast is great in their roles and Mr. Downey plays Holmes like I pictured him in my head when I was reading these type of stories when I was younger.  The gritty look at the genius and neurosis of Holmes makes him more human than other versions of this complex character.  If you have the peculiar luck or misfortune to have a genius friend, particularly one you can stand to hang out with or with luck, relate to, you will recognize how spot on he is done.  With the addition of Professor Moriarty it is brilliant to see them fight back in forth without throwing a punch, the chess analogy is used very well to show them in a high stakes contest and treat it like a game.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|If you are looking for a traditional Mahjong this will not be your cup of tea. I do like the 3D feature but you have been warned by other reviewers it will make you dizzy if you do not focus in the center tile. It is a memory hogger but it does have several  fun levels which once you get used to it becomes addictive. For me it's a keeper.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The revamp of this character hasn't been done better than the works Nolan has created in these films.  They set the bar very high with the first rendition, leapt over it with the second and to not let us down cleared it again with this one.  A few casting choices seemed sketchy to begin but after seeing them work together on screen and how they fit together it is a nice cap to a set so well done.  If you haven't seen the other two, get them when you get this one, you are not likely to be let down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book. At first, it was confusing because the author purposely left details out. But fear not, she closes the loop at the end.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This was much more fun than I was thinking it would have been when I went to see it in the theater.  I liked the cute little story of Papa Santa stepping down to let his son take the reigns per say.  When the oldest son forgets that the children are the point of all the military operation that Christmas has become it falls to the scrawny younger brother to save the day.  With a positive attitude, his heart in the right place and a little help from Grandpa Santa the crazyness ensues.  Good fun for the whole family and a good reminder that the holidays are about the kids.
4789009637|5.0|Replacing lost book of mine.  Best language learning guide I've ever used and this is my third language.  Fully recommended
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This is a great read.  Lots of twists and surprises.  I could not put it down.  Would highly recommend. I also thought the writing was vey clever.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|This was a gift for a teenager and yes it was well received. the package had everything including an album all with gaga's signature on it. thanks for making it easy to choose gifts for teenagers
B002RVCD6O|2.0|though it seemed to represent far too little of the book.<br /><br />The problem is the disc they sent me.  First of all, it was not shrink wrapped. Used?  I don't buy used dvd's.  And it was shipped by Amazon, along with other free shipping items, so it should have been new. When I opened it, there was a large blue blob on the face of the disc.  I tried to remove said blue blob gently, but it did not come off.  Since the disc played okay, I guess IO can't complain about the blue crud.<br /><br />This disc was priced the same as the TWO Deathly Hallows discs combined.  You'd think it would therefore be twice as good, in condition and in content. Not so.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Gorgeous music, lush, rich and fitting to the movie, but also pleasant to listen to separately. Relates to the South American location and events of the movie.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It's a good thing this movie was made in 2 parts. There was far too much material in the book for just one movie.  I found that it followed the book fairly accurately.<br /><br />The shipping was prompt, and the movies were well packed.  Unlike The Half Blood Prince disc, these 2 were shrink wrapped and in fine shape.<br /><br />Great ending to a great series. Great price for the 2 discs, though I see they have doubled that price since my purchace.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This movie has so many levels of interpretation. Every time I watch it I see new things to help me grow spiritually.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This one grabbed my attention because of the name, and it was an apt description. I got lost in this city several times before I figured out some things that helped me get to the next puzzle. The hints could have been better to assist in passing some of the obstacles, but I was glad there were hints built into the game. There were also some places that did not really do anything to further you but still were something to discover. That is again all fine and well but it is also distracting from what you need. It is like the extra data that you get in word problems for math - they just throw it in there to throw you off. I did not like it then, and don't like it now. It is alright, but I would not play it again.
B0007PALRU|5.0|I am enjoying watching this movie often. It's very exciting and intertaining. I would recommend it for those who like what if movies.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Shapes of all sizes, but the basic four sided blocks are not your friends. They are devious in the methods of disposal, and it only gets harder as the levels go on. Be prepared for some serious thinking on this one. Challenging but simple at the same time, this concept is interesting and keeps your attention. Some levels feel like a personal victory to get past! I recommend this to anyone who needs a good thinking game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|.I watch very little television.  I'm particular about investments of my time.  Downton Abbey is definitely worth the investment of time.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|My daughter just loved the country strong. She just keeps watching it over and over again Im so glad I ordered it for her.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i absolutely love this!!! sooooo addicted .. sometimes the graphics are a little hard to make outt like they are almost to clear. but I'm obsessed
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I agree with the previous reviewers, and strongly suggest getting the deluxe version, as most of the songs on that bonus disc are melodic, rootsy, and good enough to have been included on the main disc. Fans will love this, but I cannot underestimate the contributions of producer Buddy Miller--his deft Americana production touch expands the audience and impact of this effort, and should give Thompson the full attention of a burgeoning Americana and folk audience. I look for this one to be nominated for Best Rock Album, or Best Folk Album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Slammed series so I didn't hesitate to buy and read this right away when it came out. Colleen is a true artist. This story is so incredibly heartbreaking but at the same time, amazing and lovely and hope inspiring. Everyone needs a Holder. If everyone that went through difficult times had a Holder, the world would be a better place!  Thanks Colleen for another masterpiece!!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This is a good app. Ive downloaded it to my other devices works great with them... if it would just download to my kindle fire... that would be great!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Excellent movie. As gold as the first one. Loved seeing chuck Norris in it. Will watch again. Can't wait for 3
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An amazing story of bravery and humanity!  Could not put it down!  I've recommended it to numerous friends and family.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|On a USB 3.0 and gigabit network it transfers data at an average of 100 MB/sec. Good quality item .
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I read it during my long travels and I have enjoyed the book. Although it is quite predictable, it still kept my attention.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|If you like the TV show, you will like this- it's a good way to have the whole first season to watch anytime you want. There's not much more to say.
0765325950|5.0|Fourteenth and last in the Wheel of Time fantasy series.<br /><br />My Take<br />Yup, I cried. And cried. Even writing this review, I want to cry again. It just breaks my heart. The deaths that Rand feels. The deaths we witness. It was T-E-N-S-E. I swear, I raced through the pages. Be sure to take any heart medication before you read this, because it will be pounding! Especially with all the people being killed off right and left! Sanderson leaves it up for grabs until the last minute as to whether the good guys will win.<br /><br />It was a bit disappointing that this installment came off as more Sanderson than Jordan unlike the two previous books. It created a disconnect immediately for me.<br /><br />Rand has a lesson to learn in this, and your heart will be pounding with the enormity of the decision he must make and the completely opposite decisions that are possible. I want to go back and re-read the series from the start as Rand has grown up so much. Heck, even Cadsuane is impressed!<br /><br />There were some stupid little things in this: why Sanderson has Min do something so completely outside her usual caution; where did these Sharans come from; and, Egwene. Especially Egwene, who knows about dreamwalking. Why wouldn't she have set wards for it?<br /><br />What is going on in Seanchan? I feel as though I've missed an entire book...<br /><br />I love it! Mat wants to put Furyk and Lan in a staring contest. He reckons they'd be at it for years.<br /><br />They are horrendous battles with the accompanying mayhem, injury, and death. Battles fought on so many fronts, in so many ways. With many rethinking their own righteousness. Not enough, but many.<br /><br />As for the epilogue. I was very disappointed. It felt incomplete. As though we're left hanging off that cliff. Yes, I realize this sort of ending is normal, but considering that Jordan is dead, that Sanderson is unlikely to want to continue and start up a new series based on this ending, and that Jordan's estate is unlikely to allow any further developments. Well, damn it, I want a bit more.<br /><br />I really hate those endings that simply get chopped off. What will happen with the Aiel in future? What about the empress? The damane? Is the male half, the saidin, gone? Those are my big questions. There are always the little ones about Elayne and Rand's twins. What will happen for them. Do the White and Black Towers evolve? Can Rand's peace hold? What happened to Galad? Just what is Androl Genhold's back history?<br /><br />I don' wanna use my own imagination!<br /><br />The Story<br />It starts with a little side trip so we understand how the world is changing, meanwhile Caemlyn is being invaded by Trollocs and only half the Band is there.<br /><br />Rand intends a radical approach, one which Egwene refuses to accept. And Rand demands the Dragon's Peace.<br /><br />The Black Tower battles within. Mat journeys to Ebou Dar and the empress while Perrin enters the Wolf Dream, Tel'aran'rhiod, with Gaul to guard his back.<br /><br />Elayne will command the armies with the four great captains: Gareth Bryne, Davram Bashere, Rodel Ituralde, and Lord Agelmar. Their primary tasks are to defend Tarwin's Gap and the border of Kandor, retake Caemlyn, and destroy Shaitan.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Five young people from the Two Rivers, farming country so far off the beaten path the people hadn't seen tax collectors in decades. These five people are the pivots around which the last hopes of this world will turn: Rand al'Thor; Perrin Aybara, Matrim Cauthon (the boys are all ta'veren), Egwene al'Vere, and Nynaeve al'Meara.<br /><br />Rand al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn. He's destined to die in his attempt to save the world in the Last Battle. He is a reincarnation of Lews Therin, a male Aes Sedai who did break the world when he sealed the Bore in the last turn of the Wheel. Min is Rand's most constant companion and one of the three women he will marry. Although she gets in a heapof trouble with the empress. Sebban Balwer was Perrin's secretary and spymaster, now on loan to Rand. The Asha'man with Rand include Jahar Narishma who has bonded with Merise, Damer Flinn, and Naeff.<br /><br />Cadsuane will be with Rand at the Last Battle with Alivia; Alanna; Aviendha; Tallan, a Windfinder; and Amys.<br /><br />Tar Valon<br />Setalle Anan has come to Tar Valon as well along with Olver, the young orphan Mat took in. Laras is still mistress of the kitchens, and she will work alongside Faile, who has become quartermaster for the armies and aided by Captain Madevwin, Vanin, and Harnin, Red Arms in the Band of the Hand. It is Faile's job to deliver the Horn of Valere to Mat. Aravine was driving the wagon; and Selande and Arrela of Cha Faile was with them when the gate went awry.<br /><br />The Aes Sedai who embrace saidar and the White Tower<br />Egwene al'Vere is the Amrylin, the leader of the Aes Sedai, and she has married Gawyn Damodred, who is her Warder at last. I suspect it's Egwene's stubborness that leads Gawyn to make the decision he does about the Bloodknives. Gareth Bryne commands the armies of Tar Valon; he is with Siuan Sanche, the former Amrylin. Romanda is still the Sitter for the Yellows. Silviana of the Red is Egwene's Keeper. Moiraine has returned from the dead married to Thom Merrilin. Adelorna Bastine is Captain-General of the Greens. Yukiri is a Sitter for the Grays. Leane and Lelaine are still alive. Doesine, Faiselle, Masuri, Bea Harkin, and Sarene and her Warder Vitalien are also in this story.<br /><br />Lyrelle, Myrelle, Faolain, and Theodrin are some of the Aes Sedai outside the Black Tower. Sumeko is one of the few Kinswomen, a.k.a., the Kin, who are mentioned.<br /><br />Ila and Raen are on the battlefield, hunting for the wounded. Hurin the thieftaker is also there, fighting. Loial comes with his wife Erith, Haman, and every Ogier who can hold an axe or a sword.<br /><br />Tarwin's Gap in the Borderlands<br />Nynaeve al'Meara is Aes Sedai and a Healer; she has her own battles while Lan Mandragoran, a.k.a., Dai Shan, fights for Malkier in the Borderlands at Tarwin's Gap. Prince Kaisel, Andere, and Lord Baldhere, who worries about Agelmar are with him.<br /><br />Andor<br />Elayne Trakand is queen of Andor, Aes Sedai, and pregnant with Rand's twins. Birgitte Silverbow is a Hero of the Ages, torn from her place in the World of Dreams, and fears having lost Gaidal. She commands Elayne's guards as Captain-General and is her Warder. Captain Guybon is in charge of the Queen's Men in Andor. Lady Dyelin is one of her advisors. Melfane is the autocratic midwife. Uno has survived. Mellar, the traitorous guardsman, makes his appearance as well.<br /><br />Aiel<br />Aviendha is the third woman in Rand's life. She has passed the test and become a Wise One, but it's no blessing. Aviendha's last trip to Rhuidean has opened her eyes to the Aiel future. Other Aiel Wise Ones include Sorilea, Melaine is heavily pregnant with twins, Bair, Kymer, and Amys. Rhuarc, Bael, and Jheran are some of the clan chiefs.<br /><br />The Band of the Red Hand<br />Matrim Cauthon is the leader of the Band, the Prince of the Ravens, and married to the Daughter of the Nine Moons; he will acquire another title, Knotai. Talmanes is his second-in-command. Lieutenant Sandip is one of the Band's commanders and a hedge-doctor. Melten knows a trick that may keep Talmanes alive long enough to get proper help. Vanin is one of their best trackers, but he's gone to Tar Valon as escort.<br /><br />Mat got Elayne's backing for Aludra's dragons.<br /><br />Perrin's People<br />Perrin Aybara, a.k.a., Lord Goldeneyes, a.k.a., Young Bull, is married to Lady Faile, second in line to the throne of Saldaea. He has brought his ragtag army to Rand. Gaul is still with him as are Chiad and Bain. Queen Alliandre of Ghealdan and Berelain Pendraeg of Mayene have given their allegiance to Perrin; and, Berelain has found a new man to hunt. Annoura Sedai is still with Berelain. The Asha'man who look to Perrin include Jur Grady and Neald. Edarra is one of the Wise Ones who remain with him. The Two Rivers men with Perrin include Tam al'Thor, Rand's father and commander of Perrin's army; Dannil is Tam's second; Master Luhhan, the blacksmith and Perrin's master; and, Abell Cauthon, Mat's father. Elyas, a.k.a., Long Tooth, steps in to help. Arganda is Alliandre's man. Gallene is the Mayener commander; Havien Nurelle will play a needed role at the end.<br /><br />The Sea Folk<br />They refer to Rand as the Car'a'carn , one who will fulfill a prophecy for them. Zaida din Parede Blackwing is the Mistress of the Ships, and they stand with Ituralde.<br /><br />The Rulers<br />Darlin Sisnera is King of Tear, holding it for Rand. Gregorin is Steward of Ilian.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a good game and you should get it if you all ready don't have it installed it and you should save up coins that way you can buy something
B000I9YWDO|5.0|If you have ever worked in an office, regardless of your job, you can relate to this movie.  Even if you love your job, you can still relate to this movie.  Everyone works with someone like at least one of the characters.  Whenever things get rough at the office, this movie can always put things in perspective.<br /><br />That said, if you're looking for a great drama or the funniest comedy out there, this is not what you want.  The acting is mediocre and the premise is unrealistic.  But the movie just makes the daily grind not seem so bad.  That's why I gave it 5 stars.  If work and/or life is getting you down, it just really helps put things in perspective.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a way better version then the original one. the only thing is that it sometimes crashes win you try to use a save me when you do really good. but this is a small issue and will be eliminated in an update. it is still super fun.
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|Brilliant recording, bringing a totally different sound to the Oscar Petersen Trio.  The horn work of Clark Terry was superb, as evidenced by Oscar's own words on the cover.  Nice re-recording also.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it is ok but it takes forever to load and you do not get to pick your first horse yourself and it does get really boring after like 10 minutes
B00BB9PVQM|3.0|Got bored after the second episode.<br /><br />As for graphic content?  I wish.  Nothing we haven't seen before.<br /><br />The story is very predictable at the very least.<br /><br />If it weren't for Kevin Bacon this wouldn't have aired.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I could not put this book down. The main character and narrator was at times unlikable unlikable that is a good test of dynamic characters. Definitely not the most traditional of romances interfacing nonetheless.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly can sing anything!  Loving the 3 new songs, as well as favorites!  Kudos to Kelly and her management team for a marvelous year!  Can't wait for &#34;Chapter Two&#34;!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This was a great deal for the money.  It fit just right and worked just as it explained.  Great purchase.
B00B3MN65K|3.0|I love Josh's first single - &#34;Brave&#34;, but most of the others sound pretty much the same.  Wish that he would go a little more out of his &#34;classical&#34; lane.  I would recommend this CD to any Josh Groban fan.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars KILLED IT with this album! You'll never get bored of listening to this. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Def recommend for them Bruno Mars hooligans! &#60;3
B008MM9630|4.0|its a cute game. fairy farms good for little girls. my nieces never get bored with it. and its free, so I'm glad I got it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and my teenage daughter likes it too.  Of course, Masterpiece Theater is always good.  Lots of drama without being trashy like most shows these days.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a super great game if u love horses like  i do. cant wait to be able to buy some extra horses.
B00683JK9K|4.0|After spending more time trying this puzzle app -<br />I found myself really enjoying the music and layout style of the puzzle and of course the pictures are beautiful. It was relaxing and can see myself using it often until the 20 puzzles are completed. Actually you can extend game play by repeating a puzzle with a higher cut (more pieces). This app is something to definitely grab today while free and hold on to. Check back often to see if an update has added more pictures and if they fixed the  missing / misplaced issues. I don't use the rotate option so I cant comment on that but hopefully that would be corrected as well.  So overall I did rate it higher now due to the simplicity and beauty. It is relaxing.<br />Florida Mom.<br /><br />Ps. About missing pieces.<br />I had one out of three puzzles that had a missing piece. No I did not do any tapping or shuffling of pieces during game play ...( I can pay attention! ) it was just one piece short at the end. No I did not go hunting under the puzzle ( really? on a tablet ) I shouldn't have to look for it outside of the puzzle area..or at all!  ( Common sense tells me if I want a puzzle missing pieces ... to pull out a boxed puzzle from my closet.)<br />This would be 5 stars for sure if issues resolved. Very nice puzzle app. Worth. 99 with only 20 photos.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I read very few books. This book is very interesting and suspenseful. Even though it's a romantic novel it's suspenseful like \\"Twilight\\". If you like \\"Twilight\\" than you should read this wonderful book by Maggie Stiefvater she brings you to another world that is through the Woods.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie...had a little trouble in the beginning figuring out who was who and sometimes couldn't understand the heavy Indian accents, but other than that, the movie was very enjoyable!  Nice to see one with no bad language, no violence and very little sexual connotation as I watched it with my 16 year old daughter who also enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool free game. Graphics are good. Has taught my toddler good hand-eye coordination! Fun time waster and doesn't give me motion sickness!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great kid movie! My five year old son loves watching it,he laughs throught the entire movie. Even my husband and I enjoyed it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The book is amazing, I was hook after the first book. I am excited to find out what will happen next.
1616550414|5.0|This book is basically the equivalent of the Holy Bible for fans of the Legend of Zelda universe.  It answered many questions previously left in the dark and makes sense of everything.  It belongs on every gamer's shelf, period.
0064471837|5.0|This is one of my favorite book series and the only one that I've actually spent the time to re-read. Highly recommended.
B000G73UEU|3.0|I found this cd to be only moderately terrific.  I loved all the songs but sometimes (quite a few times, actually) I felt that the choice of artist might have been better with another song.  Also, without changing the volume, some of the songs were harder to hear. I guess that is a production problem but it bothered me a bit.  Still, all in all, Leonard is a master story teller and my library wouldn't be complete without this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good application with a lot of options to choose. You can choose from hour by hour till 10 days. Anyway i like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was so well imagined, and nothing seemed out of place. I'll remember the characters for a long time.
B008M721MS|5.0|It works fine with my kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Never crashes and the quality of the calls is really good.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the most compelling  and beautiful books I've read in a long time.  The story is told through the eyes of a dog, first as a puppy, through adulthood, and beyond.  As seen through the eyes of this beloved pet, the protagonist is a race car driver. Accompanied by his canine companion, he, too, moves from a single man, into a marriage and fatherhood and all the life lessons and tribulations which that journey entails. Uplifting, with a strain of morality that is never preachy, it is a story that will stay with you forever.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Really good Application. Works fine, it's fast and it let you do anything you do on your computer with no restrictions.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook's complete refusal to allow me to see my news feed in proper chronological order is maddening. The setting is there. It just refuses.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is a awesome game I recommend that you should buy this game so buy it P.S  smell my bres it smells like poo in da tentacle
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is one of my favorite apps; I've used it for a long time, and I'd have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. However, this morning I got a pop-up that told me that I couldn't run the app unless I signed into the Amazon App Store, which I find obnoxious and intrusive. I don't plan to stop using TuneIn Radio Pro; I like it too much. But if this continues, I plan to uninstall the Amazon version and re-install it from Google Play.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful, simply wonderful. I've never read a book by Nicholas Sparks that was ever not amazing lol . <3<br /><br />The choice was my favorite though
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is so good I'm addicted to it.  I love survivor mode not creative mode it's boring. I love to kill zombies creapers and skelitons.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Childhood's End is incredibly imaginative and interesting. Now I want to read all of Clarke's books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great novel from Mr. Grisham! The Racketeer was the best one so far. Can't wait for the next book.
037582913X|5.0|This was one of my favorite books from childhood, and even at almost 30 I still remember it so well. This was purchased for the new baby of a pair of my friends. He can't read it for a couple years, but I couldn't resist supplying him with this classic!
B007HACDLK|2.0|This is the first Vince Flynn book I have read, but I didn't care for it.  There were so many different characters that I couldn't keep up with all the foreign names...first they'd call them by the first and then the last name and it was confusing to me. I didn't get the ending either. Perhaps partly  my fault because I didn't read on it every day - I don't know - just did not care for it...altho he seems to have a lot of fans.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|It is not an amazon problem, but I have seasons from 1 to 5 with audio in spanish, but this is doesn't have this option, but with subtitles is ok.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game I always play it and it gives you a little bit of control of which humanity lives or dies
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|this is one of the best albums i bought in months !!! as a drummer i orient towards certain musicians or certain drummers in particular. this is the kind of album or collection of songs , you wish you had played on !!!
030758836X|3.0|I have already reviewed this book, but because it was negative and the editor's picked it as one of the best books of the year my review was rejected! What was disturbing to me was the author's very very frequent use of foul language by almost all of the characters in the book. Also, the ending was not really a surprise and very disappointing. The author could have gotten her point across without using the same profane word hundred of times.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|Soundtrack, visuals, characterization, setting(s), plot, writing, emotion, excitement, and joy. Cloud Atlas has it all and features it all profoundly well. Per my title \\"Please Listen to the Narration\\" it is so important. If you want to experience the heartfelt emotions and be able to follow these characters through time and understand what they're going through then please listen it will make the moments throughout the movie so much better. This movie will age like wine, Cloud Atlas is ahead of it's time when it comes to film and I'm proud to say..that I am part of it's original fan base. This movie epic is setting the stage for so many writers. Look to see a piece of Cloud Atlas in many films to come. Unfortunately it did poor at the box office and received some harsh reviews but do not let any of that discourage you. When this movie debuted it debuted to a ten minute standing ovation, and it was well deserved.<br /><br />Anyone out there who is a true fan of cinema will not count this film out until they have seen it for themselves.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Author keeps you interested in whats happening  and wondering whats going to happen next. Book is hard to stop reading, interesting adventure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|graphic is great very realist. great for kids andadults into horse plus its free so get it now now now
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This movie is definitely a classic worth watching. The family in this story is so sweet as they melt your heart with lovely melodies of another place and time.  Noticeable is the theme of being brave enough to do what is right even when it is not easy.
0765325950|5.0|I just love this book. Finishes all the important story lines leading to the end of the series and leaves you guessing on what is going to happen till the very end.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Too bad the distributor marketed this so badly here in the U.S. This is a first rate science fiction film with the required social commentary. Now if only Bloomkamp would hurry up and make &#34;District 10.&#34;<br /><br />Move arrived in pristine condition in less than five days. I'm one happy Amazon shopper.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is one of the best purchases I've made in quite a long time.  I can literally spend hours playing this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey!! It's an original series that is so different from the boring reality shows on network television.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I had been waiting to purchase her CDs and all her best songs on one CD. Fun to listen to.
B004529NKC|5.0|I now have all 4 and I can't say that I have a favorite because they are all excellent movies.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app.  It is also nice that you can download extra sounds for free. It's great for times when room is too quiet or you want to drown out an annoying noise.
B009O2XY12|2.0|wont let me move on after level one.keeps starting rite back ti level one.removes all my points..its sad cause I waited for this game to come on here and it crap
B002SS8S7E|5.0|I'm not normally a big fan of comics or the movies they inspire, but i was very pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely in love with it all. So exciting to read. I love a love story. Can't wait to read the next one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a really fun game I think its better than temple run... I think that everyone should get this game
B004BRQYJ4|2.0|liked the movie, when I heard the sound track I said to myself got to have it. should have gotten it in cd, not downloaded mp3 dont have the kick like cds. all in all the music is great
B00683JK9K|2.0|I gave this a try but didn't get very far. I was unable to rotate any of the pieces. Rotation didn't work for me even one time. Also, with several posters saying there are missing pieces, it is now uninstalled on my Galaxy Plus. The game does look nice and it would be super if not for the problems.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This was the very first book that I ordered and read on my Kindle.  I was familiar with the kidnapping and years of isolation and abuse that had been reported by the press.  I was amazed at how well Jaycee was able to express herself, even with the lack of formal education, and how well she educated her children with so few instructional tools.  The couple that abducted her were monsters, yet she had compassion toward them at times and was able to endure all their abuse.  The ending surprised me in a way when she decided to live in the same city where she was taken.  She came to feel comfortable there, and she was thinking of her children's future.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Ok a diclaimer - there's some minor things changed from the book, but teeny-tiny things you probably wouldn't even remember unless you reread the book right before watching it.<br />Stephen Chbosky WROTE the screenplay and DIRECTED the film. My brain is literally exploding at this. When does that EVER happen? That a clearly competent director realises their own vision for the on-screen adaptation? Combo that with a winning story, a sharp script with witty dialogue and an extremely likeable cast who even flesh out the book's minor characters, you have that VERY RARE thing: a five-star film.<br />Congratulations Stephen - you've done it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|she loves to play this game during her down time, of course after homework and after she has finished her chores...
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Funny. I wanted to see it in October when it was released but that did not make the movie any less funny. Not the best animation but far from the worse. Pretty much safe for children over seven if you explain some of it to your children
B00280LYHS|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, except where Percy Jackson refuses to become...never mind spoiler alert. Anyway just read the book. I will start on the the lost hero soon! :)

B005R7FOPC|4.0|I haven't got a chance to read it yet. I think I will like it though because I love the movie that is based on this book. The ebook works really well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|They were made for each other.  This was a freaky book!  I smell blackmail everywhere and Amy & Nick know how to do this equally.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Part two picked up right where part one left off.  Great character development.  You definitely see how ones moral compass can be swayed by where one lives and the events in their life.
030758836X|3.0|I really couldn't put this book down.  I loved all the twists and turns.  I just didn't like how the author choose to end the story, a bit of a let down, although I get it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|long play on free. not to difficult on casual play  but has two more tougher levels to play if you want it harder.  lots of different things to find.
1579128149|5.0|Perfect
0525953728|5.0|Did you see Zero Dark Thirty and become curious about the \\"real story\\"? Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer craft a wonderful story filled with the authenticity and detail of someone who has been there. The details and personal insights pulls the reader into the reality of life as a Navy Seal. I am inspired and grateful for all the invisible heroes, who serve to protect our freedoms around the world.
1589795474|4.0|the book was on time didn't even feel like I waited at all, even though it was a used book it was in great condition it came with a little cute bookmark that I use.  although I have not gotten around to finishing it it has been very useful thus far.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fab acting and true to the heart.  I hope everything works out for Mary and Matthew, but who knows how the tides will turn.  Suspense is building...
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This came on time..and the set is really cool. Well made and getting the graphic novel along with the DVD and mask is really cool. Got it on display at my home,.
0439023521|5.0|We're a little late to the game. The kids have been assigned to read it, the two school libraries, and the four nearest public libraries are all checked out. It's not expensive. The entire three book series are page turners. The first movie is pretty true to the first book. Can hardly wait for the other two. You don't *have* to be fasting for a medical proceedure while you read to really get into it.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Someone told me about this and I was so pleased by the price as well as the movie.<br />Great story with surpises all over it!

0439023491|5.0|Bought this book for my son.  He read The Hunger Games and he wanted to read all the books in this series.  I bought the hardcover and paid less for it than I would have at a local discount retailer.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to understand with an attractive format.  Really handy and helpful app.<br />Would order this app for all on the go items.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a really great fun app. I love horses and this 3d game is so life like. they could use some more compitions and some other horses and mabey more ways to get gems. other then that its great!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Definitely would ofrder movie DVDs fro Amazon again.<br />Although this rating system should NOT require a certain number of words to be accepted.<br />It's like having to write an essay for an english teacher.  Come on, take this intrusive word limit out of this rating system!!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Enjoy playing with friends connect with friends and family. Also play with people you don't even now. Enjoy having a blast.

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Who knew Ivan could be such a captivating character?  There are surely even more great adventures in this saga.  Such a believable universe.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm a senior citizen who watched the characters in these movies grow up, and I did not see them with my grandchildren. JK Rowling's stories of Hogwarts and the growing strength of it's Witches and Wizards is wonderful! The special affects really stand out in blu-ray. I love owning the complete collection in blu-ray. I have watched them several times and plan to watch them several more.<br /><br />Packaging and shipping were as promised.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good product for my phone. There is a lot of functionality. A a a a a a a
B0038ZITIE|4.0|Its a classic B scifi move....the music by Queen of course is the icing on the cake<br />The over the top story with its campy spaghetti Western syle is a classic of the kind of 1980 ish movies that were being made then....in other words the same italian directing/pruducing you would find in the movie The Good the Bad and the Ugly with actor Clint Eastwood<br />My only disapointment is the sound quality from the dvd that i bought through Amazon.....sounds like they are talking in a bucket
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love to play subway suffers in my spare time. It is slot like temple run 1&2 but I like this game a lot better. The graphics are great, I love the coin shop, and it is exciting and new each time I play it,the game never gets tired. I think this is a great app!
B005F82X48|5.0|I Love it!  I've been looking for some new tunes and heard them at Ichthus.  Makes my want to hear Fly Leaf as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is one of the best games ever..Its way better than the first temple run.....Temple Run 2 is also so much FUN!!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have an old fat PS3 and was beginning to become concerned about its age. After hitting the 5 year mark it seemed like the fan was coming on more and more often.<br /><br />After taking it apart, I saw that in addition to needing a good clean, the thermal paste that they used in the factory was near non-existent.<br /><br />Arctic Silver is thick, quality paste. Make sure to follow instructions so that you don't over-apply. I have had this on my PS3 for several months now and I haven't noticed the fan come on much at all. This is great stuff.
1250027624|4.0|I purchased this as a gift, of course I read it first, then I didn't want to give it away!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely Loved Hopeless! I would definitely recommend this book to someone to read. . . . . . .
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I just got started, and it bores me a bit... hopefully it will get more exciting as I go. :)
B004HAEGP4|1.0|Poor acting and not even in a satirical way. Shallow plot with little to draw you in. Save your money and time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|In my opinion it really didn't have a plot just explicit sex. I kept looking for a story and skipping the rest. I will never buy another book on someone's say so and certainly will read part of it before clicking the. Buy button.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this app is ok. it has restarted 3 times when the last time I had 300,000 coins! I used to love this app. if u don't mind all ur high scores being deleted, go for it.
B006RZZ9YY|5.0|It's a sweet story, and it still appeals to my teens who first saw it years ago. The sound track is nice, and the characters are appealing. To be honest, we parents love it too.

1451695195|3.0|A story of a medical doctor's adventures in the afterlife while he was seriously ill.  If his experience is true for all of us, then worries about the existence of hell may be overstated.  His story gains credibility because of his scientific background.  As more people write about their near death experiences, we can only wonder what awaits us after our life ends here.  Dr. Alexander is a good writer.  He admits that his words severely limit his ability to describe his life changing experiences during his illness.  Some other authors may be better story tellers, but this was an interesting read.
B005938780|5.0|What can I say,,,, Iron Maiden ROCKS!!!!!  This is one of my favorite albums from the band. Must buy it!!!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I'd have to say this is a lot more than a good &#34;chick flick.&#34;  Emily Blunt does a superb job of portraying young Queen Victoria.  Historical dramas have always rocked my boat with great settings and costumes.  This film did not disappoint.  Young Albert was dashing.  He was just the man the young and inexperienced queen needed to grow and mature so beautifully.  Would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates magnificence.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Colorful characters and a compelling story line make you feel the main character in your gut.  Heartbreaking and heartwarming simultaneously.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Good heavens above!  I never in a million years thought Michelle Williams could literally &#34;pull off&#34; this part!  She is terrific.  I am old enough to remember Marilyn Monroe and Michelle nabs her character spot on!  Adored the scenery, costumes, story line and the characters.  Enjoyed the characters interaction with each other.  Surprise bar keep (from Downton Abbey) at the end.  Would highly reccomend this film to anyone, especially those who remember Marilyn or knowledge of her painful life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I ever. Rate it 5 stars. AWESOME COOL GREAT. Play this game tell your kids it rocks for young teens and adults. Have fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|AWESOME OBVI it has all the greatest features silliness and carts so much better that the reg temple run NO-DUH SO TOTALLY OBVI
B004GHNIRK|5.0|In depth thoughts of the French Revolution.  Much more detailed than the movie version.  Really gets into the thoughts of the people involved.
B009ANAQ4S|4.0|He's still pumping out some good stuff.<br />This album is definitely up to his usual (high) standard.<br />Buy it if you're a vanfan
B00683JK9K|5.0|I have finished several puzzles in different levels. I am using a kf hd. Before you start, you can choose rotate or not, if you choose not to rotate you won't be able to because the pieces are facing the right way. If your pieces seen to get mixed up, choose the puzzle button and they straighten out. It is not complicated.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great feel good album that isn't full of dumb fake claim. Just a man telling great stories with God rhymes and dope beats. .... a must have album
B00ANW33CM|4.0|this game is a rather fun variation on mahjong, but it's actually a lot more like &quot;cubistry&quot; which is a very fun, if unpolished, game. the graphics and sound are pretty good but the controls take some getting used to. i find that everything spins exactly in the opposite direction of what i expect or intend, but hopefully it will become more intuitive as i go. the timer, as everyone else has noted, is annoying and unneccessary. you can just ignore it unless you feel the need for three stars, in which case you can keep playing a level over again till you get them.<br /><br />i like the feeling this gives me of floating in space. but thus far i do feel pretty much out of control out there in space, spinning all the wrong ways. and it's hard to see the tiles sometimes.<br /><br />as for whether or not mah jong should be timed (if this is even mah jong - it feels more like &quot;concentration&quot; crossed with cubistry) we did get another mah jong game as FAOTD that was timed and also gave you one to three stars depending on your time. that was &quot;new years mahjong&quot;. so it's not unheard of. it would definitely be more relaxing without the timer but it does give you something to strive for aside from just eliminating all the tiles.<br /><br />i think this game accomplishes what it sets out to do, and i would have given it five stars for that, except it's just too big and slow. it takes up a lot of space on my device and it's very slow to load and slow to react when you choose a level.  but once you're in the game it reacts as it should with no delays or bugs that i have found so far (i have only played five levels.) because it's such a space hog it might not stay on my device for terribly long.<br /><br />not bad at all for a FAOTD though!
B003K07DUC|4.0|Great movie! Very on you seat with suspense! Matt, as always, was great!<br />On the edge of my seat during the entire movie.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Great, Great Book!<br />One last look into a great mind - despite the dreadful, awful circumstances! I was hoping to get one last book from his pen and his mind and this is a great chance for that! His amazing skill at documenting his last ruminations during this time in his life  - and his steadfast integrity in the face of death is a wonderful example of how humanism faces down the end of life without pie-in-the-sky! We will surely miss his mind, heart and integrity!<br />Thank you Christopher...!
B002QNBRXS|3.0|About a show when the writing is in steep decline? I didn't make it to the end of this season, and though friends and family has told me the show has resumed it's original splendor, I still can't convince myself to return to it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a very fun game. I love the upgrades. and the view is pretty good when you are not running from a monkey.
0316069906|3.0|And as a vegan I truly enjoyed reading as JSF figured out how he really felt about the meat processing procedure in the states as we know it now. And I loved that it was sparked by a desire to do right by his child. However. It is fairly meandering. I don't believe I read much that I didn't already know; and I would not consider myself an animal-rights activist. But I have given it to friends and family who may know less than I and JSF's voice is so relateable that I believe him capable of reaching people on the fence about their dietary beliefs.
B000FC10WU|4.0|Just a good Agatha Christie novel. Simple story, while the characters find out &#34;whodunnit&#34; in the background, and then explain the mystery to you at the end (while still leaving the reader mostly in the dark).<br /><br />I'm just glad I read it on my Kindle. Since the language is a little antiquated, there were many words I didn't know, and it was great to have my built-in dictionary right there when I could highlight a word and look it up.
0345529057|5.0|I couldn't put these books down! The HBO show really doesn't do these wonderful books justice. These books wil get read over and over again and have earned a spot on my bookshelf with Frodo, Bilbo and Harry!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Overall this is a great buy for the money.  Backback has lots of storage, easy access, functions well as a backback when fully loaded.  My only compaint is that it needs to have more external tripod straps with better placement of the straps.  I solved this issue by using extra bunge cords.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|I'm a guy who visited Southport NC, the location of this story just after the making of the film version of this book. I love the town and reviews promised more than the usual from Sparks. I am not qualified to review ChicLit, but it was readable and it had an unexpected twist at the end. That said, I would not bother reading another book by Sparks.  Nothing personal, just not my stuff!
0451532082|5.0|IREAD THIS BOOK AS A CHILD AND I LOVED IT I LOST MY CHILDHOOD COPY AND REPLACED IT THRU AMAZON.COM.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Her best work to date...love it! I cannot get enough of this CD, it's a masterpiece I listen to her everyday.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Hard to get used to it.  i didn't care for the moving toggle area-confusing and aggravating, and I was good on the original game!  It might be okay for the younger generation, but if you want the 30+ agers, this is not the same.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I downloaded this app, but have never used it, so I cannot write a review for this. Sorry about that.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Excellent. I haven't read this book since school many years ago and I love it. I hope that everyone enjoys also.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I just love Nikki Sixx and am so glad he wrote a book on his life!!! This book is wonderful!!!!

B005FDXT32|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! This is one of the 1st movies I saw with so much violence in it!!! It is GREAT!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|This book altho containing several plot twists was not enjoyable.  I do not recommend this book.  The author has no idea about the geography she has for the setting of this thriller.  I found it offensive.  Do not recommend to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this constantly and absolutely LOVE it!!!! When I don't want to go on facebook or read emails, I play this!!!!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy.  Makes everything come together well. Could nit stop till I had finished all three of the books.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is I think the best movie by pixar great extras on the dvds good picture quality. Blue ray plays well no problems!
B005VGMYZM|4.0|Wish that it had been in English - at least it had sub-titles. The orchestra in formal attire is always beautiful to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very addictive and fun game and can make time fly for example when you are at the bus stop and you are waiting for the bus and you have to be there early you can play this game
B0032Y0OH0|4.0|Very useful in Motion 5, where going frame by frame is an absolute must. Somewhat buggy in fcpx. Please make the beta drivers more readily downloadable for mac osx, I had to delve into the forums to find them. Without the beta drivers your mac will constantly crash.
1427214948|5.0|I am such a HUGE Jeffery Archer fan.  I love this series and cannot wait until the release of the next book in May of 2013.
0307346617|5.0|My girlfriend and I are reading this book together. I like it! Great story and I love how the author takes you to places all over the globe. If your into zombies or &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; TV Show you will like this. Read it before the movie comes out this summer!<br /><br />The book itself came in good shape from Amazon and looked to be brand new.
1427206031|5.0|When I read the summary of this story, I was not sure if I would care for it.  However; I am a huge fan of Jeffery Archer, so thought I would give it a try.  It was the most captivating story I have listened to in a very long time.  More praise for Jeffery Archer!!
B000002QWD|5.0|There are so many awesome songs on this CD it is a must have!  They just don't make Christmas music like this anymore!  I mix this CD in with the Christmas playlist for the house and the whole family loves it!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so addicting (of course), easy to see the cards, and there are several game choices.  Love it!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Good for some great stomach laughs!  Even though there is a teddy bear in the movie, it's not a good choice for a family movie, but for full grown adults hilarious!!!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, such a unique and awesome concept.  I bit gorey at times, but for the most part, really good.
B008RZF2I0|4.0|There's a lot I could write here but others have said it more eloquently than I could.<br /><br />The new lead vocalist does an excellent interpretation of Khan... with his own twist. They haven't missed a single beat with this guy.<br /><br />I still contend that The Black Halo is their best CD... but this is a great CD in it's own right. Every single song has some very nice guitar work, vocals, etc. And what I mean is that they have kept their classic \\"operatic\\" quality while lacing it with some excellent, heavy riffs and melodies sprinkled here and there. The 11th song comes to mind... it starts out so sad and appears to represent a funeral or to honor for a fallen loved one... but there's some tasty heavy guitar work in the middle that makes the excellent.<br /><br />The leads are more ambitious in places and overall, they retain their classic sound... while being a little bit more aggressive than before.<br /><br />I can't wait to see them live... nice new album. Enjoy.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Technically it gets the job done. It covers my kindle. The standing part of the case has started to get floppy and it doesn't stand up as well as it did at first....I've only been using it for a few weeks. I chose this one because it was much cheaper than the leather cases but I guess you get what you pay for.
B00B92ZO3G|5.0|\\"To Sell is Human...In Thirty Minutes\\" was an excellent summary of the book \\"To Sell is Human\\" by David H. Pink. The book illuminated the importance of sales, not just as a job career, but sales in everyday life. I particularly enjoyed the section about the importance of improv which really showed the creativity and whimsy Pink uses to express the necessity of quick thinking and effective communication in everyday life. The condensed version \\"To Sell is Human\\" was ridiculously helpful because the main points of Pink's original novel were summarized and simplified so I could fit some reading time into my busy schedule. I particularly enjoyed the chapter summaries because they included all of the necessary points without skipping important details. I believe learning how to sell yourself, so to speak, is an essential skill, especially in today's economy. The shortened and seamlessly condensed summaries of \\"Thirty Minutes\\" really helped me to evaluate my communication skills without taking up too much of my time like reading the original novel would have. I strongly recommend this book for anyone looking to improve their persuasive skills and communication abilities.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game. I get to connect with my friends on facebook I hope you'll enjoy this game too!

It was an amazing story, yet sad, this poor girl had many horrific events in her life and she stood strong.  There are no words for Holder, OMG, I fell in love with him instantly at the Grocery Store.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has done it again.  You are always teased with story lines that turn into the unexpected.  What a page turner.  I could not put the book down.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good time killer. Interesting twists. Really liked the graphics and how the color stood out. Different puzzles to solve pretty neat over all.
B0000714BP|5.0|i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so fun. It's kind of like taking care of a real horse.. But if you like horse's then I recommend downloading this game! :D
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like
B009DP9D6A|2.0|Normally I like deadmau5's music but this album is only good for mistelecomunications, which is an amazing song. This album was pretty disappointing
B005LAIGN2|5.0|i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like.
B00980IA3M|5.0|Comprehensive collection.  Excellent value. Would recommend for anyone who enjoys Wagner operas  Contains hours and hours of enjoyable music  Would have liked an information booklet included but can download
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read. I enjoyed every page and can hardly wait for more. Now I want to see the movie.
B005VXLICA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Michael Eriksen and Circus Maximus.  So when I found out about this, I had to listen ... and listen ... and listen.  Just a really solid album -- no filler.  Makes you want to sing and dance.  12 songs of Eriksen singing -- that works for me!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|It's one of the greatest movies that I have seen, it's not an Oscar winner but you will have a lot of fun watching it, the movies arrived really fast and in excellent condition. Would totally recommend it.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|It works, and given Apple's tendency to overcharge for things like this, the price seems ok.  At least I can use my old(er) chargers with a new MacBook Air.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This move it's great for those who loved the FF VII game, it has move film time and even though it does not change the story much from the original version it is cool to have the extra footage time
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Well deserving of the Emmys that this show has received. Incredibly written and acted. If you have not checked out this series, it is well worth your time.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy to read and cute love story<br />Makes you fall in love  with the couple despite the circumstances. Will pass  on for friends to read
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Without too many spoilers, Downton's third season was really good, but at the same time, external factors caused it to be the worst season ever with actor departures effecting the show.<br /><br />I have gone from loving this show and its creators to loving this show and hating is creators and the industry that produces these failures.  There is no reason why the British television industry should be so poorly managed.  What a shame that British shows suck after three years.  (i.e. Downton, Being Human....)
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It had too many other groups of people I had no interest in.  All the characters I am interested in have been killed and now it looks as if Jon Snow has been attacked and killed.  What next? Doing away with Arya & Sensa?
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I like Ken Follett's books, and this was another winner. The early twenth century history told by characters from Whales, Germany, Russia and the US gave me a view of the many sides of the conflicts. Follett Is a master storyteller, and his ability to weave so many characters into a coherent tale is spellbinding. This book got high marks from my Book Club, and we couldn't wait for the next installment. Excellent read for the history, intriguing characters, and great story.
B005IQZB14|2.0|long winded and poor writing. Found myself skipping whole pages trying to find something interesting in this book.<br />Reading the reviews I expected more.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I love this show and was sad to see it get cancelled.  The characters were really developed by the time this season cam along.  My favorite episode was near the end of the season, when Shepard is a cop in the ulster ate reality.  It was an episode that combined stargate, and CSI perfectly.
B007CBEO20|2.0|Singer voice was messed up for a couple of songs... the piece inside the case holding the cd was broken in pieces... other than that.. it was fine<br />Still love the band though!!
B004LW8C0I|2.0|I have had many GREAT experiences with Amazon, but this has to be the WORST EVER. First took FOREVER, to get here, when it did, it was a version from THAILAND. What the heck!!! C'mon, if I wanted a bootleg version, I'd bought one off the street.  will be reluctant to purchase anything ever.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the first book I ever purchased on kindle and boy was I pleased. I think this book will stay with me for a long time. Loved,loved, loved it!
B005C9YZIW|5.0|This Blu-Ray is the prime reason that a Blu-Ray player was designed for. The photography (video/still) are the best seen with people that want to be wowed.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I was curious about the way the DVD looks physically. It reminded me of a ripped off copy.<br />Where did you get them?<br />As for the movie, I love it even though the Swedish trilogy is better.
B0051OZ564|4.0|I love this movie. It's a classic. Beautifully written and executed!!! The extended version is a must have for an action fantasy buff.
1401216676|5.0|The Joker is such a great charcter and villian this will be a book to read every year. Boom Blam!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a fun game. It freezes up a lot &amp; will not open every time. You have to uninstall then you loss everything you did. May be better on the HD Kindle
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Loved the craftmanship of the head, useing the screwdriver to open it and the season was the best,cant wait to c what they do next.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow..what a thrilling read. I couldn't wait to open my kindle and lose myself in Ana and Grey's world. I actually felt some of the butterflies Ana felt when experiencing her own sexuality. I can't wait to start the second book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have been in love with this show since Season 1...glad to add Season 3 to my Amazon Videos.  Since Amazon Video is now available for the Ninentdo Wii, I foresee myself watching more & more streaming video via Amazon.  The quality was as good as Netflix.  I did have a few problems occasionally with the streaming process...the video was interrupted for the program to download content. However, it didn't happen that often, so I was still overall pleased with the purchase.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very addictive and challenging as you move to higher levels.  Too bad you are charged for help/hints.  I will just keep trying.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Oh this is great!  I can get the current weather for home and families location while drinking my morning coffee without having to go to the computer or tv rooms.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is aswome. I think you should get it. It is like temple run witch is also very good but in subway suffers you travel around the world.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recently found the Downtown Abby series.  Look forward to keeping up with the series.  Watched the first 2 series for free on Amazon Prime -- definitely worth the $1.99 for the season 3 shows!
B00004YM0D|5.0|Great soundtrack to a great movie! Old school motown is great anytime & any place. Check it out if anyone out there still listens to CDs too! Lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|Better than the first one. Can't wait to read the last one. Where is Peeta? Didn't much care for the abrupt ending.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I loved this first season.  Well I really love John Hamm and the woman who plays his wife.  They do excellent work.<br />Not to leave out the rest of the cast.  They too are marvelous in each role.
B000006NUW|5.0|Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  He has a GIANT collection of all kinds of music so I was hoping this would be something he would like and he does.  Glad I decided on this one.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great book, opens your mind and makes you realize things you normally would not think of on your own, puts things into perspective.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very suspenseful and exhilarating!<br />I could not put the book down. I cannot wait to read the next book.<br />I would definitely recommend this book!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Amazing fast shipping thank you I couldn't wait to listen to this album. It's so amazing what the finishing product of a man his thoughts and a guitar can result to.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My family had to talk me into playing this game,but now I can't get enough!!!  I really think it's so much fun!!!
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|This DVD of Downton Abbey Season 3 said it was the &#34;original UK edition/version&#34; but at the time I had no clue that meant it wouldn't play on USA DVD players. I've since found out it's only playable in Region 2. More detail in that main title would have been appreciated. When I order & receive the USA version of Downton Abbey Season 3 I will write a 5 star review because I'm watching it weekly on PBS. Looking forward to Season 4. I highly recommend to anyone to get all of them but be careful to purchase the correct version for the USA.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I was skeptical to use this app but now I love it. I set it for 15 minutes and my husband says I am sound asleep by the time it's done. The only bad thing is that you can tell it's on a loop, a little too regular. My favorite is the rain storm :)
B007A2O3FO|4.0|What wouldn't be good w/Maggie Smith in it - I liked it. I'll probably buy any production that stars Maggie Smith - isn't she great in &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love  this game it's so much fun it's<br /> Like your really in Rio or new York and it's fantasizing. This game should come to life because it's so awesome
B000006OAM|4.0|I have a friend who loves this womens music so I got it as a gift for her, It was a fast shipping, in a cover and of good quality. As for the music, she is an excellent artist in her music industry and of course, opinions in music are for the individuals own &#34;taste&#34; of music, mood and enjoyment. I would recommend you listen to her samples of music which is always nice to be able to do through amazon before purchasing anything. There are times I will go through dozens of artists, new and old to listen to their quality and type of music and often purchase from amazon just because of this ability to go here and listen to music first before buying it. I have also never had any problems with buying as they say, used CD/ nor DVD they have all been of good quality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun on kindle fire.my kids love it. I love it !  Wish I could buy stuff for my horse I wish I could buy the unicorn.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|Dexter is a show that is only nominally about a serial killer.  It is more about humanity and questions what makes us human.  In this season, Dexter who has determined he has no feelings continues to evolve and attempts to learn what others feel and how they form relationships with each other.  Something he has determined that he cannot do.  This season he finds his long term girlfriend pregnant and that is important in his life to marry her and be a father to the other two children she has as well.  How does he reconcile a more normal life as a husband and father with a secret life of a serial killer?  He finds that marrying will require him to live with his new family but he wants to continue to live alone and keep his own apartment.  He will have to be home nights to eat dinner with the family and attend family activities not just pizza night once a week and a date night on the weekends.  It's all too heady for a serial killer who keeps shady hours and needs to hide his whereabouts to carry out his vocation.<br />In the desire to find a friend who he can allow to see the real him, he finds a prosector named Miguel Prado, who also is frustrated when he knows that the law has set a murderer free and there will be no justice.  Accidentally, Dexter \\"shows his hand\\" and he hopes that Miguel has the ability to understand and follow the same code as Dexter does.  But people are different and Miguel has his own code which doesn't fit the moral code Dexter and his father long ago mapped out for him.  This season has a lot going for it but I did feel it was the weakest season until season 6 came along.  Still season 3 moves the Dexter story along and the development of the character as he transforms over several seasons as a three dimensional character rather than one just written on a page as he sees himself.  Of course, a character like Dexter can't exist in real life but this character can steadily adopt more human emotions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome!I love it!!!If I could recommend 1 book series to my friends,it would be this series!EPICNESS!Awesome x10!!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Use to charge other units, cell phone, 2 kindles, small game units and with assessories wall socket and car charge unit.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|I have watched The Descendants about 9 times, again each time we have houseguests.  There are 3 main reasons I am so drawn to this movie:<br /><br />1) I lived on the windward side of Oahu for 10 years in the seventies.  The musical score of the movie is a collection of the best authentic musicians, most of whom were entertaining and recording the music I grew to love while I was there.  I could float away on beautiful memories just by listening to the score.<br /><br />2) The struggle for commercialization of the Islands is a constant struggle tainted by greed and insensitivity to the original Hawaiian culture and people.  I am so glad the movie dealt with this very real issue, and I was ecstatic about how it was ultimately handled...from the heart.  Love of the Land and the People....that is what Hawaii is really about.<br /><br />3) The theme of forgiveness always touches me deeply...yes, this is how we go on living our llives with some peace.<br /><br />I was also pleased that the only well-known Hollywood star in the movie was George Clooney...the rest of the cast seemed like real people.  I finally recognized Beau Bridges, but somehow, he is no longer a STAR idol to me.<br /><br />This movie is a pure pleasure for me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My boys have really enjoyed this new upgraded version! They really love the rope slide and new scenery and background images...
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Although its not a very unique story, it was built well. Liked the characters, very believable. Good chemistry, quick fun read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy does not take a.<br />brain surgeon to play and it is fun to go to scraggs and beat the fish
B0058BI896|5.0|Like all top-notch comedies, &#34;The Big Bang&#34; succeeds because it has a fresh setting (a group of scientists working at a prestigious West Coat university in fields like astrophysics); strong character development; actors who perfectly suit their roles, and superb writing. In season 4, the quality of the series shows no signs of letting up. During the course of the fourth season, Penny and Leonard have broken up, and both date other people (including a very funny storyline in which Leonard date's one of his best friends' sister), and by the end of the season Penny seems a little wistful at having broken it off with Leonard. Sheldon gets his own sort-of-girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler, brilliantly played by teevee's Blossom, Mayim Bialik. Penny develops a friendship with Amy; self-styled ladies' man Howard realizes his strong feelings for Bernadette; Wil Wheaton returns, and Levar Burton does a cameo; while Raj remains his usual earnest self.<br /><br />I heartily enjoyed this season and would highly recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book story line very good. Ending totaly different that what you think it will be. A must read for all ages.
B000IFQLBE|5.0|I saw a review somewhere, I can't recall where (perhaps AllMusicGuide?) which perfectly captured what this album is about: really tight, clear-sonics, and a John Fogerty sounding (and playing) like he's either invented a time machine or found the fountain of youth: he doesn't sound like a raspy Dylan, he sounds...like he did in the 60's. Has the energy too, really playing for the joy of it, infecting the audience with it.  GREAT drivin' music. Coming down off a ski day in Elm with friends from Australia, the dude was singing along, knew all the words to them ol' tunes, touched my heart all ways. You know at least 1/2 or more of these songs because they're part of the fabric of the 60's, part of the social memory of America.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very handy! big buttons. simple to use. love that i keeps tack of last calculation. would definitely recommend. two thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this app! its perfect for anyone who likes to create things!  I wish the updates came as fast as they do for the ipod though.
B000W965QW|5.0|Simply amazing piece of work. Loved the movie and always wanted to read the book and couldn't put it down.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|Great movie and Jeremy Irons is terrific! The life of a companion from egg to adulthood. Add this to your collections of dragon movies including Dragonheart!
B0040T7CFS|4.0|Whew, this is a large collection!  This guy's output, in terms of disks, is 50% larger than the complete works of Beethoven and the keyboard works of Scarlatti that I also own.  Eventually I'll get into the choral works, which are the most numerous.  (The index, and the box itself, are categorized by type.  Handy.)  But so far the harpsichord performances are good to very good, and sometimes excellent.  I can get bored by mediocre harpsichord playing pretty quickly, but what I've heard so far is super.  I look forward to the organ pieces.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great new version.  like the new characters.<br />upgrades and extras are fun.  screen view great.  new paths very challenging.  addictive just like the first.
B003L77GG0|5.0|We had all of the seasons but two so this completed our collection. My husband a big fan of this series.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is the best all time romantic comedy. If you love to laugh, and smile, don't pass it up. While it has an element of Christmas to it, it's not overwhelmingly christmassy - so it can be watched year around. Jude Law is to die for in this flick.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|If your dad liked to sneak you to Kung Fu movies in the 70s behind your moms back, then you'll like this over the top movie. That genre wouldn't win over any of the \\"I liked the book better\\" crowd and it doesn't attempt to. I persoanlly own the HD download of this movie. I would say at the very least, if you like martial arts movies it's worth a rental.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game I play on my kindle. I like it more than I like both Temple Runs combined.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This whole series is just wonderful.  I loved the two main characters and the way they were able to move around<br />using the system to accomplish their purposes.  I particularly like the strength and intelligence of the girl..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE it!! I just dont like the ads that pop up at the home screen. I love that i dont have to have internet to play!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Unfortunately, I ordered the Kindle version of this book.  I loved the book and found it a valuable resource.<br />However, It would have been more useful if I had ordered the regular book version.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it.  It had suspense, and romance.  It kept my attention throughout.  The characters were believable and made you want to know them.  All in all a good read.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I find the author witty and although I didi not like the movie, I thought the book was<br />well written.
B008MEM24S|4.0|It is an interesting game and just challenging enough. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good way to pass the time.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This whole series is just wonderful.  I loved the two main characters and the way they were able to move around<br />using the system to accomplish their purposes.  I particularly like the strength and intelligence of the girl..

030758836X|4.0|I have not finished the book but am very pleased with it up to the point<br />i have read.  It is interesting.
B000031EGV|5.0|really love this movie, have been waiting a long time to be able to get it on a DVD format.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This whole series is just wonderful.  I loved the two main characters and the way they were able to move around<br />using the system to accomplish their purposes.  I particularly like the strength and intelligence of the girl..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game really let me see what it was like to take care of a real horse. I didn't want to close out of the game. it is fun
0345529057|4.0|Very good value. The books arrived prior to the estimated time and were very well packaged. I'm enjoying the read.
B000FC1AGG|3.0|I really loved Sophie's Undomesticated Godness.  However, I'm not as big a fan of this one or the Shopaholic.  They are okay.  They just did not draw me in as much.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This book is as well written as any other by John Grisham that I've read. I really enjoyed seeing familiar characters from A Time to Kill come back up with a little background to them. Highly recommend.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was funny and really entertaining. Loved the characters! Watched it with my teenagers and didn't cringe or feel embarrassed at all. Just good fun!
B0096BIENY|3.0|Each song is wonderful by itself but they all seem to have the same dynamics....start out soft and grow in volume.  Hard to listen to the whole thing all at once as it wears on your nerves.
B005F3XV62|5.0|You just gotta love Kevin James! This movie was just great. Really love the main character and also the part Rosario Dawson plays. There are still some parts that I smile every time I think of.<br />We've watched it a few times and I'm still not sick of it yet.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it!! The book was awesome!! I can't wait for the movie! I recommend that everyone should read this book!!
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Surprisingly good! There were a couple  twists that I was totally not prepared for. We re-watched the first half of the movie again as soon as the end credits starting rolling. Not disappointing at all.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game. just wish you could explore rooms  without having to find  certain items that u most likely have to buy just to play
B00AOB3FES|5.0|This movie is truly a classic. I enjoyed it as a child,<br />and it is such a pleasure seeing my little boy enjoy it as well.<br />Can't go wrong with a classic Disney movie.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.  Great story, great price, great everything.  Was very happy to find a copy for a reasonable price.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|Finding Nemo is a very cute movie with nice story line and a good<br />variety of characters. Perfect for family movie night.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Great Maroon 5 cd! You can count on them to put a couple of songs out that I can't get out of my head all day long!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|everyone loves both the first and second season.  can't wait for the next one to come out so we can enjoy it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Why did Matthew have to die? He is my favorite. I sure will miss him but I will watch the next season.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|Forget sneak attacks with this thing. You can hear the fan roar to life in it from upstairs. The pullback handle to change cartridges is tough to do while being fired upon. My 10 year old LOVES it though. It's his biggest nerf gun yet. We did find that the large top of the gun works great as a shield while you're trying to get it to switch cartridges.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Wow, I can't beleive I got this fantastic Beatles Box Set.Some years back I decided to sell off my record collection. Big mistake. As usuall what you have isn't worth anything. You're lucky if you can give it away. Words you usually hear from someone buying. Anyway, I purchased this box set and it feels so good to be back in the sound of vinyl. Rich, full, smooth and the covers are so awesome to look at. I can read the print without using a magnafying glass. Dust off that old turntable and kick back to the sound of vinyl. I just wanted to share this thought and tell everyone that Amazon is the place to find what you're looking for.
B000001Y79|5.0|I remember when this CD hit the charts for the first time. I must have listened to No Doubt on the radio for months and loved every second, so naturally while looking at old CD's I came across it and jumped for joy. I LOVE this CD, Tragic Kingdom is perhaps the BEST No Doubt CD EVER to hit the charts. So many songs on this album are phenomenal.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I bought this for my daughter but I have watched the concert too. You can definately tell John Mayer takes performing seriously and wants to give you your money's worth.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|This is where it all began.  The story could be a dry history, but it begs you to contine reading it.  You just have to turn the page!!  I love non-fiction, but even still I think even people who are not fond of non-fiction would find this book easy to read, interesting, and hard to put down.  I am going to go on to read the next book, &#34;The Quest.&#34;  I'm looking forward to it!
B00ANW33CM|1.0|This game is not traditional mahjong. You rotate 3D cubes and look for similar tiles. Not my cup of tea.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|To the developer(s) of this game, I give you a high five Barney Stinson style.  I never want to sit it down.  I don't usually download many games but I am glad my 4 y.o. godson showed it to me.  I would have gladly payed for this game!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I played this on a friends iphone and got hooked, so I  downloaded it on my fire. awesome graphics, good response. my only complaint is that I can only play it once. When I came back the next day to play again I got stuck at the loading screen then eventually booted back to my home screen. reinstalling the app does no good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is sooo addicting! The app on my Kindle is so easy to use and navigate, just like being on the computer!
1451696191|5.0|Reading the book The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky was an emotional experience. After beginning to read this book, I could not put it down for hours. To be honest, this book was not what I had expected it to be, but in an exceedingly good way. I had started reading the book with no other expectations than hearing from friends that it is their favorite book. This is the personal story of a boy named Charlie during his freshman year of high school. Charlie is a nerdy boy who is a \\"wallflower\\". He does not quite fit in with the kids his age and is somewhat lost in this point of his life, trying to analyze every little thing. It is made up of a series of journal entries from Charlie to an unknown character. Throughout the novel, Charlie shares every emotion and feeling he is experiencing in intense detail. He begins the book with telling the story of losing his best friend to suicide his 8th grade year, and automatically the reader feels a sympathizing connection with him. Later, he goes on to meet his best friends, Sam and Patrick. These two characters have an immense impact on Charlie's life. They teach him about true friendship, love, sex, drugs, and high school life in general. The reader attaches to Charlie and travels with him through this emotional roller coaster of life. The reader begins to live through these experiences with Charlie by feeling ecstatic through his moments of being infinite and experiencing pure happiness and aching with pain through his moments of depression. This book teaches the reader to live life to their fullest and appreciate everything you have in life. Everyone goes through struggles and hardships through their lifetimes, but it is not what has happened to people that define them; it is how we as people overcome these hardships that make us who we are. This is the lesson I got from reading this book and I greatly recommend it to other readers. I enjoyed every moment of The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband saw someone playing this on a plane and he purchased it on my kindle as soon as he got home. We will sit there and play back and forth with it for hours!
B005LAII80|5.0|First off I have to say Karl Urban absolutely owns this movie as Judge Dredd. Casting him was the best choice they could have possibly made for this movie, as he is an actual Judge Dredd comics fan, so he gets the character. And it absolutely shows in his performance.<br /><br />This movie is just like a roller coaster. Just pure non-stop action from start to finish and you never want it to end. Yes people, it is ultra-violent as its rated R. You should know that going into this. If you can't handle these kind of movies, just stay away and go watch The Little Mermaid or Twilight for yourself and don't come here complaining about its rating and violence. Its just a movie get over yourselves.<br /><br />The 3D here is pretty good, I would put in on par with The Amazing Spider-Man's if you have seen that movie. Its average for most of the movie but during the slo-mo scenes its actually pretty good. The DTS-HD Master audio here though is fantastic, and the movies soundtrack is beyond fantastic. It definitely will give your home theater system a workout and sounds great doing so. Combine the 3D with the amazing sound and you have yourself an amazing immersive experience. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, this is one of the best comic book movies I have seen in years.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Aside from Death Proof, Django is my new favorite Tarantino film and this CD does not disappoint!  And everyone I share it with agrees and at times are even surprised it's from a Tarantino movie.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have watched the three versions of P&P on TV/Movies and loved them. So now I wanted to read the book.  So far I am loving it also.
0307346617|5.0|I bought this book because I can't wait for the movie.  So far, so good, I've never read an 'oral history' before but I like the change of pace, can't wait to finish the book and then see the movie!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|nuff said. but they are making me say more than i would like to. This movie is the best one of the year because it is the funnest movie of the year.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I loved this flick when I saw it in theaters and have been waiting for so long to buy it on DVD because it never went down in price.  The used copy I bought was a great deal, no flaws, I'm very happy :)
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The Blu-ray showed up quickly, perfectly packaged.  I bought this because my husband (huge fan) had seen this playing on PBS a while ago but and tried to DVR it.  The picture quality was awful, there were way too many pledge drive breaks and he only was able to record about 3/4 of it.  The high def was breathtaking along with the sound quality!  We have a huge theater system and it was almost like being there.  Amazing product, highly recommended!!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 takes almost an allegorical look at the topic of a society out of control, and the aspect of personal responsibility and empowerment. Definitely too heavy for the younger kids, but perhaps a bit thought provoking for the older crowd.<br />Or, just Batman as he ought to be - tough and stubborn and unwilling to back down in the face of a vicious opponent.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|because they killed Michelle Rodriguez again im a huge fan and i don't appreciate that. they shouldn't have killed her off
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is one of the best books I ever read. The longer I followed the dialogues between Mitch and Morrie, the more I started to think about myself and my interactions with friends and family. I found myself crying several times when I read about a situation that described sometimes in great detail what I had lived through in my own life. I believe that any person who reads this book will be a better partner, friend, colleague or parent he or she was before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is a very fun time waster. I enjoy having the challenge of beating my own scores, and the price of the app is excellent. The cute themes they throw in such as Rio and newyorkcity add a nice touch that make it more interesting than temple run. Also, it detects movement far better than temple run two.
0765325950|2.0|First of the story is one of the greatest I have ever read, but the quality of the book itself... terrible. There are ink smears and color runs all over the place. The dust cover is curled up on the edges, and some of the pages are frayed. When I buy a new hardback, I am looking for nice acid free pages. I love the hearty feel of a good hardcover page. None here! Even the paper is cheap and substandard. In fact, I only give this product 2 stars because the book is one of the best I have ever read. I will never buy another hardcover from amazon, especially not for such an iconic book that I was hoping to become a focal point of my library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really addicting it is awesome after a while you change places for instance new York went to Rio
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is a definite page turner!  I read it within 24 hours.  I am having a hard time finding a book that compares!  It's a must read!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was great and it's better then the movie and I was happy they miss her so much and Toto
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think this game is awesome and fun.I really like this game.it is a good game if you like to play bingo. I like to play bongo so I think this is a grate game :)
B000002OTL|5.0|It got here in a relative good time and it's in great condition so thanks. It plays perfectly and works, that's all I needed.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Was this novel really written by Ken Follet as part two of the Century trilogy? Compared to the very excellent 'The Fall of Giants' the writing is simplistic and the plot(s) stretch credulity. The basis on historical fact is still there but there are very few surprises this time. It appeared to me that the writer was attempting to complete a commission and had lost all interest in it along the way.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Exellent classic book and great illustrations! Reading for all and everytime. At last i can read this wonderful book on English (i'm russian) - thanks to Amazon and Kindle for that!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am definitely gonna buy the second part!  It's very good so far, and will make you want to stay up reading for hours.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|is \\"useful\\" but no more than a video in YouTube or any other type of information you can get in the Internet, the only good feature is that is free.
0525423656|5.0|I've been dying to read this book ever since I finished `Matched'! That was one of those books that I heard everyone loved, so I decided to read, but still had my doubts about it when I picked it up. Luckily, they were blown away when I actually read it, and I think Crossed was even better. Something that I thought I would easily dismiss has turned out to be one of my favorite dystopian trilogies.<br /><br />This time around, some mysteries from the past were cleared up, secrets were revealed, and friendships were tested. New characters were introduced, and while I absolutely loved some of them, I couldn't quite figure out others-and not only because they were purposefully trying to be mysterious. I loved having every other chapter told from Ky's perspective. At first I didn't think I'd like the new voice-though there was no other way to tell what was happening to him in the Outer Provinces-and allowed his character to develop and let the reader understand some of the difficult decisions he is making.<br /><br />I loved the integration of `Do Not Go Gentle' into Cassia's personal rebellion as well as the theme of the book. That poem has practically followed me around all of my life, and it's one of my favorites. I'm glad it's one of the few that's managed to survive despite the Society's best attempts to eliminate all other pieces of art.<br /><br />The ending seemed abrupt and forced for me, as if there wasn't a good point to leave off for the next book. I didn't think it fit in with the pace of the rest of Crossed, and although I wasn't happy with it, there was still enough to make me come back for the next one. I'm definitely sticking with these characters to see what happens next, because this book was more of a transitional `journey' book, getting from point a to b. While I liked reading it, finding out more about the characters-particularly Ky and Xander-I think what I'm really looking for will happen in the next installment. I can't wait!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I both really like this game. :)  My daughter is three, and she is so smart. This game really helps with her brain power and knowledge skills.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I'm really not that corny, but seriously, this was good. It has been a long time since I have stayed up this late just to finish the last 25% of a book because I couldn't stand to go to sleep without knowing what happens next.<br /><br />The characters are all well written and just deep enough. The details are so real that you really forget that they are only words.<br /><br />I am so excited to continue this series!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator, it's so easy to use and has everything I need to balance my checkbook don't change a thing.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Its a great B/W movie for a rainy day, if you understand French and know Paris. A tale of morality and thought, plus a little love.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I AM A NOVICE WITH MY NEW DEVICE AND THIS APP MAKES IT EASY FOR ME TO GET BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY.  I would recommend this to all of my friends.  I haven't found anything yet that displeases me.  Keep up the good work!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the coolest game ever!!!!better than temple run!!!<br />I wish I get cheats for this game because it's hard but fun!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is easy to follow and I have ample space within my pocketbook.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book was wonderful. Well written and provocative. It proved that even the most ferocous animals have a strong sense of survival.
B00007GZR5|5.0|MADE IN MEXICO = 1st PROBLEM!!! OUT OF SINK THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE!!!!!!!!  GREY BLOTCHES ON FACES FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE!!!!  MAKE SURE THE DVD IS COPIED IN THE USA!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Would be an awesome sequel if it didn't LAG LIKE CRAZY. I tried turning down the visual quality, tried redownloading it, but each and everytime it lags to the point it freezes. Then I'm forced to shut down my Kindle. Try to lose some of the details. I would gladly sacrifice graphics over gameplay.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was written from the perspective of a doctor, so it's heavy on the scientific detail, lighter on the emotional side of things.  I was surprised that there was no mention of Jesus.
0897502027|5.0|I wanted to learn more about Bruce Lee and I am really amazed at all of his philosophical work that is in here. There are so many AHA! moments. If you are looking to be inspired and connect with a true martial artist, read this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy doing this when listening to the radio - or a so-so program on television.  Easy to play as well.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|works great and I really enjoy the DVD and the series.I would recommend to anyone  thanks again for the DVD
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addictive! Easy without paying for anything! Runs smoothly 95% of the time for kindle fire hd. It is a must have!
B003M70O5O|4.0|works great and I really enjoy the DVD and the series.I would recommend to anyone  thanks again for the DVD
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Awesome app to use to keep track of my Ebay on my Kindle. Works well and has everything I need to buy/sell/watch/keep track of my account.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recommend this to everyone because not only is it free (if it's free, it's for me!) but it's easy to use & convenient. My actual bible is heavy to carry & now I pop my Kindle HD in my purse, take it to Church with me and follow along easily. Plus, you<br />have choices of which version you want to read. I prefer the NIV for Church but<br />like to switch when I'm having my quiet time to the NLT for easier reading.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is intriguing and fun. I like mystery games and hidden pictures, and this is a wonderful mix of the two!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm addicted to this series... Love it and recommend it to anyone who loves the classics...<br />Thanks Amazon... Better than Netflix.....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator reminds me of the original calculator for iPhone, which I like and am used to. It's really great for a free calculator, which of course I don't believe you should have to pay for anyway on a Kindle. Just saying.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|Unfailingly John Williams' orchestral magic, but subtle and subdued for this majestic film. A score that is perfectly fitted to the mood and dissonances in the action on the screen. A bit of fun in the music where appropriate, this score has to be one of John Williams' best ever.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's Twitter for the Kindle! Works well and does what it's supposed to. Don't go on Twitter very often but when I do, it's on this app.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I always go for the sports films but this wasn't anything new.  Actors were good so if nothing else no one will throw a pie in your face for renting.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this mainly for school, as my school books have the option to come in pdf form. Yes, the Kindle does automatically read pdfs but I like to sync everything with my computer and iPhone, and this is a great way to do this. Wonderful way of keeping my textbooks and syllabuses together. I love that you can use acrobat.com on here. It does take a minute to load the book, but once it's loaded, you're good to go! Awesome!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|easy to use, does the job perfectly and does not drain the battery. I would recommend it to a friend.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It's just like every other Angry Birds, but with seasons. But it does look darn good on the Kindle :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! it's more fun than temple run! Out of 10 I give it a 25! It is great! I hope u love it as much as I do.
B008XG1X18|5.0|First off, I have a prior love for Pinterest as it is, but this app is great for the Kindle. It's similar to the iPhone version (which is also good). Impressed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I highly suggest it if you like horses,best of all its free! It's perfect if u have a daughter, or a babysitter or for even your son.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this. I've always been a big fan of the game, but this app is wonderful, especially for being free. And the definition is pretty darn good.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was just as good as the first one. Completely engrossing and consuming. Definitely would read over and over again this was such an amazing book, can't put them down
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|It works, it does what it's supposed to do, and does what it says. But it looks cheap and strange, at least on my Kindle. I prefer to just go to the google website instead of using this app...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app has filled my urge to buy a horse because my mother told me they were to expensive and now you can get a virtual horse that doesn't cost you or your parents any money
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I used to play this on the iPhone, but I do no longer... Because of my Kindle. It is so much better trying to draw on a bigger screen.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a very good book, I really enjoyed reading it. I felt that the movie and the book followed closely togeather.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have fallen in love with this game! I love match-three games, and this is wonderful! I would definitely recommend this!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a Great book. I Couldn't put it down. It is a perfect ending to the hunger games series.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I chose this to write notes with a bluetooth keyboard. Works well in that matter. You are able to make it into a pdf and send it through email or office suite, which I like because I like to have everything on all of my devices. I wish there were more themes and further customization, but other than that, it's great for note-taking.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I've reviewed or at least seen several Belkin cases for the Kindle Fire HD 7\\", and all have been well made, attractive cases. Some have more features than others, such as an AutoWake magnet, closure straps, and genuine leather covers. The Belkin Classic Case, however, is a bare bones, no frills case. It's also the most economical Belkin case for the Kindle Fire HD 7\\". If you're looking for a low cost utilitarian case to protect your Kindle Fire, this may be the one for you. The fabric-covered case is stiff enough to give reasonably good protection for the Kindle Fire's screen, and the attaching elastic corners will securely hold your tablet (it's the same attachment system that's in the more expensive Belkin cases).<br /><br />If you do go for this case, you should understand what you're trading off for the cost saving:<br /><br />* Fabric cover instead of leather.<br />* This is a simple case only, it does not fold into an easel as other Belkin cases do.<br />* There's no elastic strap to provide positive closure (I recommend using a rubber band to ensure that the cover stays closed).<br />* There's no magnet to activate the Kindle Fire's AutoWake function.<br /><br />That's about it. If I had to rate the case compared to other Belkin cases, I would have to give it 3 stars, but quality is often defined as meeting the user's expectations, and if you simply want a low cost case that protects your Kindle Fire HD 7\\", the Belkin Classic Case gets 5 stars from me.
B005V2S7FW|2.0|I don't like this one as much as I like PassPal. I would try both out before you decide on one.
B00979CS50|5.0|I absolutely loved this release from Neil and CH! Being a fongtime fan of Neil Young, this release was another step up for the duo and shows that Neil is still rock rock rockin' in the free world!
B004SDEP38|2.0|You can't really do anything unless you buy the full version. So this isn't really a review. Just an informative statement I guess.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|Having been a &#34;Heads&#34; fan and then recently seeing St. Vincent perform at Moogfest in 2011, I had to buy the CD and check this out. &#34;Love this collaboration&#34; would be better for the title! This was very enjoyable to sit down and listen to.
B005K17RU0|5.0|For free?? You really can't beat this! Seems to be pretty accurate and it can put into your notification center, which is awesome. Every time I look at it, it is up to date! And if there is a weather warning a big red exclaimation will appear on the clouds. Really great.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love this game! I used to play it on my pc and was happy to see it available for other devices. It is a relaxing match-three game with challenges added to different levels. When you pass a level it is rated from one to three stars so you can always go back and try to beat your score on any level. The graphics are crystal clear and very colorful. It is great to play on touch screen devices and is very responsive.
B00884GR0W|4.0|If you enjoy Minecraft, you will like this. It can be a little difficult to manuver at times, but overall, it's entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I bought this book because I am a Christiana and thought it was a revelation of the author's experiences<br />in heaven with God, seeing some of his family who had preceded him.  He's from my home State so I began<br />to read it with such joy and interest - especially since the author is a scientist.<br /><br />I think he had a legitimate experience &#34;out there,&#34;  &#34;way out there&#34;  and doesn't know where  he<br />was.  Father God and His Son never hesitate to identify themselves and it has never been as &#34;Ohm.&#34;<br />Evil is out there as well, and the all-too-common experiences of the living and those who've ventured<br />out there is that evil presents itself as light.  Only later do people learn how dark evil is.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I really gave this a chance and I'm glad I had a back-up alarm set. I don't know if it stops or what, but I tried it without sleeping(multiple times), it worked. Tried it when I sleeping, didn't work. Plus not a good choice of sounds. You have to pay for the full version in order to put your own songs.
B001OKGX92|5.0|I've seen in a few jillions times and still love it. The 11+ minute chase scene is one of the best in movie history and I'm not the only one that feels that way - I've heard the same thing on TMC and read it in different movie critiques. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Oh and it doesn't rely on computer graphics to move the story along or even provide a story, it's cinema at its best. McQueen is wonderful.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I have always loved to play Osmos on the iPhone, but this exceeds all expectations! It's great to play on the bigger screen of my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. And it is definitely high-def. It's absolutely worth the money. It's relaxing and challenging at the same time!
0765325950|5.0|Of the first 13, I thought 10 were amazing and three were a bit slow and unwieldy.  But the last book was non-stop from start to finish.  Lots of great twists and turns.  Had me fooled I must admit.  I told my son, &#34;It is worth reading the first 13 just to get to the 14th!&#34;
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's Angry Birds for Kindle. Looks great on my Kindle Fire HD, and it's fun to play when I'm bored.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Season 4 blew me away -- I had heard it was a very good season and &#34;they&#34; weren't kidding.<br /><br />(trying to avoid a spoiler) -- I just wish they could have had the story without all of the reprucussions for what it means to the main character
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I would catergorize this as a novelty game. My boyfriend likes to play this because it's comical and different. But I'm not so ammused. I guess this isn't my type of game, but if you like this kind of game, you may enjoy it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved it,it was cool really take your time to read this book its short sweet and it gets to the point.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's Facebook, but the quality is great on the Kindle Fire HD. The options are easy to find/use, and all of the function I use are there. Nice.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Was a really cute movie.  Don't think it is any break through stuff, but it will keep you entertained.  At least i did not fall asleep
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzles are a great way to pass time, or as a relaxing before bed game that doesn't include stress. The pictures are cute and I like that you can go from very easy, normal, and very challenging.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome and the smallest one on the market (260 KB) It lets you run around in your own world with tons of items and now they added armor and signs! Plus tons of other things. Go Minecraft!!!
0143120581|2.0|psychopath  ˈsīkəˌpaTH <br />noun<br />a person suffering from chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior.<br />* informal an unstable and aggressive person: schoolyard psychopaths will gather around a fight to encourage the combatants.<br /><br />I just wish I could have been there when she put the kid outside in freezing temperatures so I could call the cops and have this bitch arrested.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I love when u get cought the coins that u earned adds on to your final score and everything is just the right price but for the alien it is a little to high because it is 500 spaceships to get a costume but it is pretty cool so again I love this game
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I think Tron: Legacy is one of the best movies I've seen in a LOOOONG time. I recommend it to any fan of the 80's genre and any retro gamer out there. The special effects are amazing, and so is Jeff Bridges. Anyone who knows what the original Tron movie is about and liked, or didn't like, it will be highly impressed. I definitely recommend it to anyone.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I would love to actually have facebook on my kindle fire. Unfortunately, everytime I start the app I have to input the security code sent to my phone EVERYTIME. And the news feed is still broken.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the new google... I seriously surf Pintrest more than google anymore! Great ap on the Kindle Fire... and I love that you can upload pins now!
B0052SF6CM|5.0|Great compilation of music.  It will probably become a collectors item in the future.  This is a great buy for anyone who like Calvin Harris.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you are bored and like to do puzzles then this game is for you. I like it and just downloaded it today. Me and my husband helped each other with a puzzle and its just great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome fun game. You jump run roll and complete daily challenges!I think you people should try this game it willbe fun.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja is the first game I downloaded for my Kindle Fire and it is such a kick to play. You've got to be quick and accurate. This is a good one to test your reflexes.
0762439009|1.0|Says it comes with a \\"big toe\\". IT WASN'T HER BIG TOE! IT WAS THE LITTLE TOE! Why does this make me so mad? I don't know. Can't buy the thing now since they got it wrong, though.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is awesome! Get the game! Don't poop your pants. This game is very scary but fun. Don't look behind you. Slenderman is going to be there!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Good read. Lousy ending. After all the twists and turns I feel cheated for having spent the time reading the whole story.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I own the original release DVD, the Final Cut DVD, the HD DVD collectible set and now this is the ultimate and definitive bookend to my collection.  It does not disappoint.  The clariity is such that on the opening street scene I could almost feel the rain and smell the noodle broth.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|As new to all this android stuff I have found the app very useful & give it 5 stars & recommend it to kindle fire users.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I reccomend this app for all ages. If you saw the movie called Rio; Rovio Entertainment Ltd. did a super job forming this game. Great job!
B00B8PMWJI|3.0|I was really looking forward to this film being a fan of almost all of the directors' work.  Unfortunately these shorts only have two notes - either to shock (a la torture porn style) or to be ironic, clever or funny.  Some of the shorts are decent but the issue I have, which I feel is a MAJOR issue with a horror anthology and given the talent involved, is that none of these shorts are SCARY at all!  I was only grossed out(which isn't being scared)or laughing.  Never was a feeling of dread or suspense or terror upon me (the closest would be \\"D if for dogfight\\").<br /><br />I am still glad I saw it, just know what you are going in to see.  My favorite hands down, was \\"o for orgasm\\" directed by the duo who did the totally underrated gem \\"Amer\\".
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a great edition to the Angry Birds saga. It is much like Angry Birds Space. This app works well on any mobile device.
B005S9EJ46|3.0|This movie was filmed in exotic India and while one thinks it starts as a good tale, it dissolves into wasted talent of otherwise marvelous actors. One thinks it is about aging people, but it dissolves into the story of an aging homosexual looking for his old lover in India... the old Indian dude had gone on to marry and have a family... and the gay dude dies. Parts of it were very pretty, some lines were hilarious and some scenes touching, but it's not something or appropriate subject matter for young children.
B009ZQGNPQ|1.0|Spoiler alert -  I naively wrote a friend of mine in England about how enjoyable I thought the video was.  He wrote back to ask me how i could stand this tripe and then began to point out all the upcoming ruination of the Family.<br /><br />  I should have known it was going off with the every episode a cliff hanger in season 2.<br />Now we have an avid thinking feminist, Sybil,  not only marrying a Roman Catholic, she becomes one in a church where mysogyny is the default protocol.  In Season 2, we'd seen the father who manages neither his farm nor his money pushing himself on a maid, here he loses all both money and reputation.  Then you thought it was bad enough for William to die but  NOOO they have to kill off Matthew.  The list is endless.  Too bad they fired the good writers and went with the hacks.
B000YHG72E|3.0|Not very well thought out Christmas movie. Don't care for Will Farrell and Ed Asner as Santa..... Uh no. Almost seemed as though they ad libbed through the entire movie. Even the addition of Bob Newhart didn't help. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Two of the disks would not go to the menu (play) screen until laoding them three times.  Otherwise, everything was as expected.  The one big negative that I have is that these disks play with black lines on the top and bottom of the screen.  With a widescreen television and a blu-ray player and blu-ray discs, I expect the full screen to be used.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|The author provides plenty of characters and imaginative action, but things tend to drag early on and as the author resets everything during one of the many plot twists. Unconventional characters are endearing, but they just have to bring in the authorities at SOME point and let their on-the-lam friends melt into the shadows. This was particularly disappointing to me at the climax. Maybe this isn't my genre or I just feel I paid too much for a six year old book when I can get the classics for free.
030746363X|5.0|i am lazy as hell when it comes to sports. i used to play basketball on a semi-pro level until the age of 25. then i was injured a lot (back, achilles, ..) and i decided to walk away from basketball and focus on my carreer. thats when the weight loss started. in late august 2012 i was 98 kg by 174 height (jeans size 36) when i started the 4HB. i am only doing the diet. i used the supplements recommended but only until november or so. as of today, i am down to 83 kg, and jeans size 32. ok, it is not as fast as promised in the book, but i have to admit that i was not really striked from the week before christmas until mid january. now i am back on track and just bought a kettle bell swing to see how that goes.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was a very persuasive book. Whenever the author tried to describe something, it felt like I was there experiencing it myself. I would so totally recommend this book to you. On to \\" The Sea of Monsters\\"!
B008QOFOQW|5.0|Our 5 year old daughter loves Lego Friends.  She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them.  We purchased a set for Christmas and it was a big hit.  We decided to add this set to expand her collection and she loves it.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Heartlake Flying Club Play Set comes with 195 pieces.  It includes the Stephanie character and a Seaplane and Pier to dock the plane.  It has a little building and a few accessories.  The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for a 5 year old.  The recommended age is 6-12, but a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution.  I have found that the average per piece price of the LEGO Friends sets are around 10 cents per piece.  That is the going rate from WalMart/Target or when Amazon is the seller.  Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more.  We purchased this set at WalMart for just under $20.  Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection.  Highly Recommended!
030746363X|5.0|I love this book, I've read the 100 or so pages on the diet section about 5 times through for motivation. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a simple to follow diet. There are also tons of other great tips and information on work outs, adding muscle, sex and supplements.

B00AB0Z88S|1.0|This movie was boring and offensive.  It spent way too much time in exposition about the kids life (which was actually more interesting) and then kills off all the characters. But because we've already met the main character in the future, we know he will not die, so there is no tension.<br /><br />The whole movie was trying to make the audience believe in god, in the most stupid and asinine way.  It was offensive, and is not for anyone who enjoys intelligent movies.  It is the second movie in my life I've ever wanted to walk out on.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This is a really good app.  I had no issue with this.  Tried it with the rotate on and off worked both times.  You do have to double tap to rotate.  Love the choices of pictures available and the different levels of play.
B00766CLPI|1.0|I love this album, but what a disappointment this remaster is. Thirteen Grammys and you brought up tons of noise, hiss and it sounds eons worse than the original CD/first re master? The quieter sections are unlistenable through the hiss. And they used so much compression that the whole thing sounds flat and devoid of any air. That pure pristine voice often sounds distorted and like it is oversaturating the microphones. What was once beautiful music sounds like it is drowning in thick midrange soup. Bad. I can't believe Barbra approved it. She should pull all the copies, fire the engineer and start all over. Boo (literal) hiss.
B00006GEB4|5.0|Whats not to love, its the flaming lips... on vinyl. This gets played often in our house. I would buy again.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I couldn't stop playing until I finished the game!  Great story line, engaging puzzles and intricate &quot;seek &amp; find&quot; games!
B008XBASVY|4.0|The book makes you think about your life I would read it  again I was surprise how great the writer was.
B00003CXD0|5.0|dustin hoffman shows his knack of being able to cover very well the broad spectrum of his acting abilities.very well done
B009GQ57ES|5.0|In all honesty when I found out that Macklemore was from Portland I instantly assumed this album was going to be terrible (because really how many good rappers live in Portland). But I was so surprised because it is actually just the opposite. I loved it, all of the songs are spot on hits. I love &#34;Same Love&#34; and of course &#34;Thrift Shop&#34;, but then there are non-singles that are just as good, if not better such as &#34;Neon Cathedral&#34;, &#34;Can't Hold Us&#34;, and &#34; Jimmy Iovine&#34;. The songs are filled not only with introspective moments, but overall critiques of our society and religions. Macklemore has a lot to say, Ryan Lewis gives him excellent beats to say it to. I recommend you listen to them.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I think this is the best since the first paranormal activity but it was a bit over the top at times.  If you like over the top movies this is your movie to watch
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I love Coldplay and I went to their Mylo Xyloto tour stop when they came to San Jose, California. It was great to watch this and relive the feeling of being at that show.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|A little confusing.  It was difficult to keep up with the length of time in which the story takes place.  The plot was good, and the characters most interesting.
B00466HM28|5.0|If you like to make music and need a mobile on the go set up, this should definitely be considered. 8 pads for beat making and 25 keys for working on synth parts. Highly recommended for those on-the-go music makers out there.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I am on my third Kate Morton book.  I love the way she writes, and the time period in which her books are written.  There are few characters to have to keep up with.  Makes for very easy reading.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I was turned on to Ellie Goulding by her song &#34;Anything can happen&#34; so I bought he album and it's amazing.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Again, I like the way she writes and the time period of which she writes.  Very easy reading.  The characters in the book are easy to remember because there aren't too many.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I didn't want it to end, yet I couldn't stop reading it every chance I got. I'll just leave it at that -- it's wonderful. If this is remotely your genre of author or book, buy it and don't look back.
B00979CS50|5.0|Saw the concert, read the book.  The album does not dissapoint.  I cannot stop playing it and finding more fun stuff each time I listen.<br />Crank it up!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 had the most interesting intrigue in this post world war 1 setting.  The scenery and costuming was especially gorgeous, particularly in the last episode.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is another example of imaginis pure domnentce over all other endless running games that don't compare.  if u liked templerun u will love the second version no doubt and for all the people who say it is to hard and confusing with turns get out of the digital age./
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An amazing series that's a page turner from beginning to end!  Highly recommended, and the price for the Kindle version can't be beat.
0783225482|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was a child (don't ask... for whatever reason I've watched it at least a million times starting at 6). It was a family fave. Glad to have it back in my possession. So unique. Nothing like a good old 90's sinical thriller/dark comedy. It's good every time. And the 'special' effects aren't too shabby for the era. Disc was in great conditioner and it came on time.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Huge help when I was at doctor's office, taking notes on info I needed to follow-up on.  Like getting different background colors for notes.  Still getting to know the product and all it can do.
B003QS9VYE|3.0|I remember really feeling for this movie as a child and it striking some sad notes in me. I watched again as an adult... and was mortified lol. It's so mean! and such classic racism and prejudice. The story... for disney... is sort of lackluster. Very short running time very little going on, and lots of elaboration and length on scenes that don't really have a purpose. Got very uninterested in all the odd/unfunny circus performances. I was like \\"ok... moving along now. we get it... he's a cheap circus act... now let's get back to the story.make this more dramatic or cut it shorter...\\" It had the potential to be a great film that tugs at your heartstrings and has a little historical background... but instead it sort of makes you mad and bitter that they depict black ppl as scrappy birds and faceless, characterless workers, and that ppl are so cruel. I don't want some sappy sweet film, but it could have been done better. Maybe this was how it was at the time, didn't really check the year it was made... but I was a little peeved. Anyways.. good seller. It's in good conditioner and came on time.<br /><br />On a nerdier note... I didn't really understand the relevance or the significance of him having big ears being an issue... or a possibility. The adults were indian elephants... clearly he was an african elephant, which are more notorious and prestigious due to ears in the first place. I digress. It's a kids movie...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great for everyday math needs ... big font for these old eyes.  Good for my lifestyle, especially when I'm away from pen and paper.
6305428425|5.0|I used to watch this as a kid all the time. It's not quite as realistic as an adult but still a good 90's movie. Very cute and very funny. Some parts are a little corny far as attempts at humor or portraying realistic traits go... but nonetheless it would make an awesome sleepover movie for teens of today who have no idea things outside of Miley Cyrus exist. Came in good time and disc is in great condition.
1563523302|5.0|There may be a misconception about this book in some quarters. I didn't really read this as a \\"how to\\" type manual. It really is a book about adjusting your attitude to wealth, and seeing through the lies that the American consumption model and advertising industries are based on. More than anything this book will help you get comfortable with the concept of living below your means and effectively saving a portion of the income you have for future wealth creation. It debunks commonly held yet stupid beliefs such as a car/suit is a good investment. Also, encourages people to invest in what they know about and not to take out a mortgage too large for their income. Seems like simple advice but taken together it was a powerful message that helped me correct a number of lifestyle mistakes I had been making in my early 20s...
B005WUHAX8|1.0|If you read this review, don't even waste your time reading the rest. This thing is fake, unsupported by LIFEPROOF when it breaks a week after you put it on your phone. Don't bother trying to send it back to the seller either. They're busy spending your money elsewhere!<br /><br />Poor product<br /><br />Poor response
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Bought for my 3yo son. He now loves the story and all the characters. Not nearly as scary or sad as many disney flicks tend to be, and unlike most Disney movies, the plot includes BOTH a mom and a dad.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|Anything by Freddie is just magic,and add to that the wonderful voice of Monserrat Carbole and you have a winner every time
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|If you enjoy irish based novels, his won't disappoint . The characters were believable even if the ending seems unlikely.  But I enjoyed it anyway.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I was debating for the longest time between this and the 3930K and ultimately chose this because for almost double the price and 10% improvement i could not justify a six core processor yet. I've tested and tested this processor to see if I can make it reach its limit in actual applications that I use everyday and I have found no roof yet. I was transferring 40GB of files from my external while I was rendering an animation while I was installing a game while I was running an antivirus scan while I was compiling a level in Unity3D while I was running Crysis 2. And there was no slowdown in anything I was running at any time. This may be in part thanks to my 32GB of RAM but a lot of it was on the processor and it never went above 30% or 40% usage. With a noctua NH-D15 it never overheats even with overclocking. I would highly recommend this processor to anyone.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|this was a gift for both my parents. my mom loved it. she loves all the mission impossible movies. =]
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abby Season 3<br />Well I HAD to own a personal copy of Seasons i and 2 so it follows that I HAD to own Season 3.<br />A subject I love and impeccably done by people who know how to handle this genre.
B00AFEY354|5.0|i love this movie and when i saw it in theatres i said im going to buy it. though it hasnt come out yet on dvd/bluray. but ill be waiting for it
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I really enjoy the Jack Ryan novels.  I like that Tom Clancey is a quicker read than he use to be.
B002BWP49M|5.0|i liked watching the twilight movies. mind you not a fan of reading huge books even though i own them. but i thought this was real good
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This is such a fun addictive game. I figure there are much worse things to be addicted to though than a Amazon game.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|i thought that this was a great movie. so sad though. i hope you enjoy the movie like i did
B00B8PQC5S|2.0|Besides a couple of really cool segments, about 5 of the 26, Most of the stories were either boring or about poo.  Would not recommend.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|always loved this movie just never owned it. currently the one of the proud owners of this movie. will definitely buy the 3d one that came out
B005FPT51K|5.0|2/5/2013<br /><br />The camera works very well using my iPhone 4S. Both my wife and I can simultaneously can use the iBaby App using our individual 4S phones. There is a 2-3 second delay, but otherwise the video quality is excellent and the audio is definitely usable. We went ahead and also bought the top rated Philips AVENT baby monitor for real-time high quality audio...however given the capability of the iBaby unit the Philips monitor seems redundant.<br /><br />The primary wi-fi router is downstairs but the nursery is upstairs. I use a power-line ethernet box (Netgear) to go from the downstairs router to 2nd upstairs wi-fi router. The iPhone and the camera have to be connected to the same router to work properly (upstairs). As a result I get a steady connection between the upstairs nursery and upstairs master bed. Easy.
B0053O89IS|5.0|i cant say how much i love this show. cant wait for season 8 to be available to buy on dvd
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I really wanted to like this, I even ignored the other reviews hoping that they were wrong. I really wish I hadn't - I was so disappointed! I tried to set it up and couldn't even get past the startup on my phone. The monitor wasn't recognized by my iPhone or my husband's iPad or droid phone. We tried several times before we eventually gave up. I can't have a baby monitor that is SO unreliable (especially one that I spent $300 on). Save yourself the time and aggravation and find another baby monitor.
0307719774|5.0|i find this t be very fun. i look forward to doing it again next year to compare the difference and all that
B00000K3G8|5.0|I accidentally ordered the CD when trying to order the DVD.  However,  this has to be one of the greatest albums out there from this time period.  David burn is awesome.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|i loved this movie in theatres. of course it was awesome to see it in theatres compaired to at home but i still like this movie
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I am a dude and I am not afraid to say that I actually really enjoy this movie.  It is the only movie in this sort of genre that I like.  It does not take itself too seriously and the aging British rock star character is hilarious.
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought this trilogy mainly because I wanted to find out what the hype was all about. Also, I hate when I get one book that belongs in a set because no matter how good or bad the book is, I always need to read the series.<br /><br />I loved this set!  While a lot of it was very sexual, the basic plot of this series is a love story. It,s not your typical boy meets girl, fall in love, something happens, they make up and live happily ever aftermarket either -- however one could break it down to that.<br /><br />Overall, it was worth every second I spent reading instead of sleeping through the middle of the night.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This is yet another wonderful book from Patricia Conrwell.  I have loved all of her books.  Would reccomend to anyone that likes murder mysterys.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you amazon for bringing this up in my search of Iain Banks' books. I have to congratulate your search engine, without which I would probably have never come across this classic.<br /><br />Beautifully developed, the characters are so strong you feel like tuning your radio to their frequency and having a chat. Congratulations to Mr Howey. Looking forward to more.
1433502410|5.0|This is a wonderful study bible, and it really helps to understand each book of the bible.  I would highly recommend this study bible.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was hard to put down and I will forever look at the after life differently. Amazing story told very skillfully.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved everything about this book. Loved how the chapters were split into now and then was a very nice and easy way to provide the information
B001EN71HC|5.0|It's great to own them all in 1 small package! Each movie comes in a very skinny case inside of the cardboard case. Perfect for my collection.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this series of games are wonderful,  ut i do have one problem......i cannot play just for like 5 mins but i play for like hours on end when i do play. one of the best games ever.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I DID NOT LIKE THIS APPLICATION.  MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE I AM SOMEWHAT TECHNICALLY CHALLENGED,  BUT I FOUND IT WAS NOT USER FRIENDLY FOR MY KINDLE FIRE.  EVERYTIME I LOGGED ON I HAD TO RESET THE ALARM.<br />I FIND IT ALOT EASIER TO JUST USE MY CELL AS AN ALARM CLOCK.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|I've always been a fan of Friedman; read his &#34;Free to Choose&#34; when I was in my early 20's.  It helped shape my views - I am a fan of freedom and today's liberals are (ironically) driving us further and further into slavery.  In Capitalism & Freedom, Friedman clearly articulates the basic principles of freedom from an economic view.  He's not so much concerned about free speech as he is economic freedom such as property rights and the right to keep what you earn.  He proceeds to discuss many of today's social programs (public housing, Social Security, corporate, farm and other forms of welfare) and how they all diminish our freedom.  Redistribution policies are discussed as a failed philosophy and practice.<br /><br />Liberals will hate this book because he tears their sacred cows to pieces and exposes them, as Teddy Roosevelt said, &#34;well-intentioned but weak-minded.&#34;  This book is as pertinent today as it was when written.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie is still great after all these years. The special features are really fun and interesting, as well. Awesome.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|A Tom Clancy book is always a great read, I'm a fan if you like his fast paced action with great tech insight. You will love this also.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|great music and a great story.  truly warms the heart to hear a story like this. i hope he makes another album!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is really cool I especially. Like Rio but it lags a bit but my favorite is ? Boxes so
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These headphones are older now but they work well. There is the occasional popping but it is negligible. I would recommend these to anyone and they will definitely improve your call of duty skill. They basically put you in the battle and you can hear EVERYTHING.
B004132HZS|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this show because I've never really been interested in detective stories and have never been a Sherlock fan. I wouldn't have watched this show if I hadn't been STRONGLY urged by family members. Boy, am I glad I did! I had to watch all of the episodes in both seasons before becoming hooked but I am now obsessed! The episodes are funny and clever and I get something new every time a re-watch them. Sherlock and Watson's relationship and their personalities are portrayed wonderfully and the modernization of this story has been done perfectly. This is a great adaption of the books, which I am now reading. I would urge those wouldn't give detective stories to give this one a chance!
B004X75RK4|3.0|Worth watching for Betty White. Some good moments, nice Alaska scenery. Not the best product from Bullock or Reynolds. Fairly common themes throughout.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the third season of Downton Abbey. The series does a great job addressing issues that we encounter in modern day.  I can't wait for season four to start.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The third season seemed like the writers were grasping a bit more than the first 2 seasons and went for shock over substance in a few areas. Overall it is quite a bit above the usual US offerings. Sure to anger a lot of ardent fans however.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I bought this because it said you could watch the standard version on the pc but the link to the standard version is broken.  Can someone please fix this?  I really wanted to watch it tonight
B001AP11L6|4.0|UNTIL I HEARD &#34;BALL & BISCUIT&#34; ON A JOSE CUERVO COMMERCIAL .. I DID NOT THINK MUCH OF THE WHITE STRIPES ... BUT THAT IS GREAT SONG ...

THE HUGELY OVER-RATED JOHN MAYER !
0375842209|5.0|I can't adequately express how moved I was by this book.  If you only read one book this year, let it be this book.  I promise you will be moved by the story...you will be amazed at what a novel can actually do to your emotions...you will buy copies for friends and family and you will certainly love it.  It is one of the best, most moving books I have read!

JULIANNE HOUGH, MALIN AKERMAN, ALEC BALDWIN, PAUL GIAMATTI, AND RUSSELL BRAND DID A NICE JOB, AS DID CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IN A SECONDARY ROLE ... THE STRENGTH OF THIS FILM IS THE MUSIC ... TOP NOTCH  '80s HAIR METAL & ROCK ... WHICH SOUNDED SUPERB ON THE THEATRE'S SOUND SYSTEM !
B003PIS5XI|5.0|The space effects by the standard of today are amusing, of course, and reflect how much space adventures have changed since 1984. If movies like ET, Explorers, The Navigator are throw back movies for you, and reminiscent of younger years, you'll find The Last Starfighter is still worth a watch.  I was surprised to have found it can be enjoyed through Amazon Prime streaming.  It was fun.
B000002JSJ|4.0|THIS CD IS NOT THE LED ZEPPELIN  FROM THE '70s ... AND PROBABLY IS AN INDICATOR OF THE DIRECTION THE BAND WOULD HAVE TAKEN IN THE '80s HAD NOT JOHN BONHAM DIED.  NOT THEIR BEST WORK BY FAR ... BUT HAVING SAID THAT, IT IS STILL LED ZEPPELIN ... A BAND WHO ON MANY LEVELS YOU COULD ARGUE RANKS SECOND ALL-TIME TO THE ULTRA-TALENTED BEATLES ( SORRY STONES ZEALOTS , BUT #3 IS STILL SUPERB ) ...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love an author who knows how to effectively use the element of surprise. This is a Must Read!!!!<br />Truly!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very great book. Keeps you intrigued throughout with twists and turns you never saw coming. I highly recommend this book
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This is a great action movie from start to finish.... Completely entertaining. I have never read any of the Reacher books and don't intend to.  Books are seldom like the movie and vice versa.  It appears that if you are a huge Reacher book fan you probably shouldn't see this movie.  If you like Tom Cruise you will really like this movie.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|i enjoyed reading this book.  it kept my interest, but i wasn't to sure about the court house scene.  i liked the ending, it got me wondering.
B004PGO25O|4.0|great one. straight to the point, very insightful. i really appreciate his stron call to actions. it's definetely challenging your mind.
0812550706|2.0|Here are my random observations. I originally gave this book 3 stars, but after thinking more I had to downgrade.<br /><br />I thought I would like this book, but it was hard to get past the basic premise. I never understood why the hero had to be a 6-year-old child. He didn't talk like a 6-year-old and he wasn't treated like a 6-year-old, so in my head I had to repeatedly force myself to imagine one.<br /><br />I thought the ending was atrocious. When I had about 15% left, I wanted it to be over. It got long-winded and didn't flow with the rest of the book.<br /><br />I'm not one to see sexual innuendo where it's not meant to be, but the amount of nudity seemed weirdly intentional, especially since it involves young boys. Boys were often taking off their clothes or running around naked or showering or wrestling...Awkward...<br /><br />I won't be reading more of the series.
0684824906|5.0|Should be a must-read in school - excellent history lesson and insight to the great men of the era. Doris Kearns Goodwin never disappoints.
B00026KDC2|4.0|The moment i heard Hey You i bought the cass back then and loved it ! Hey You is one simply but great song that i played over and over till i wore it out ! The rest of the album is good and fun to listen to ! Other reviews have them in the mould of the Black Crows but i say they are a cross between Motley Crue and Cinderella ! They make music fun and dont try to make it thought provoking !
B009O2XY12|1.0|freezes way too much to be fun!<br />fix issues with this app and it would be a blast!<br />thank you
0765325950|4.0|For all the waiting and worrying that the series might not be finished, I would say this wraps things up fairly well. Most of the book is dedicated to the final battle and the chapter baring that name is almost 200 pages long, so if that was what you were looking forward to this should prove satisfying.

B00824ZJ84|5.0|I have a soft spot for Rebecca Furguson. The reason is because there are people in my family with the last name Ferguson and one name is named Rebecca.<br /><br />In all seriousness, though. I had a hard time getting used to this CD. Don't get me wrong, her album is great. The lyrics are emotionally charged and the music feels like it matches the mood of each song very appropriately (especially RUN FREE). What bothered me the most at first about this CD was Rebecca's voice! I know its silly. She is blessed with natural rasp, and she has such an even tone while she sings. Her voice sounds very mature and her overall music making ability seems very developed throughout this album. Now that I appreciate Ms. Furguson's voice far more, I really enjoy this album. It's classy, its soulful, its refreshing, its heaven to my ears! There are still sections of this album where I think Rebecca could have taken her voice further by yelling or roaring every so often. That is my only complaint anymore.<br /><br />Amazon says this album is simply a pop album, but cramming it into that genre robs her of a fan base. I think there is a lot of great R&B, jazz, soul tones to this album. In comparison to other similar artists, Emeli Sand&eacute; seems far more poppy than Rebecca Ferguson. Their overall style seems very different in general, though. Also, her overall artistry surpasses Elle Varner's for sure. More accurate comparisons to her would be Missy Higgins, Sara Bareilles and maybe ZZ Ward

B00AE2IJIE|5.0|There was a lot of humor I thought may have been inappropriate for kids.  But it was done really well.  I was happy to watch it!

B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|Lifesigns is what I like about the new music business. There's much to carp and moan about, I'm all too aware, but I try to find the positives, and this is a most wonderful exhibit of why. I received this message on my Facebook page on New Years Eve:    Hi Tony,  Just wondering, with your love of prog if I could point you to something new  for January 2013 -[...]  Hope you like it!  Have a great year, and  best wishes,  JY    The sender, JY, is John Young, the musical mastermind who's put together an incredible lineup, and together with engineer Steve Rispin (Asia, Uriah Heep, Dave Kilminster, Snakecharmer) has succeeded in producing a modern prog rock classic. Gathering up talent such as drummer Frosty Beedle, and the legendary Nick Beggs on bass & vocals would be impressive enough, but he's also brought along Steve Hackett, Thijs Van Leer, Jakko Jakszyk, and Robin Boult for assistance.    Now, I'm guessing that John Young spent a good deal of time and money over the last few years putting this all together, and that the participants may not be vacationing in any exotic locale with their session fees, but the beauty is that with no record company standing in the way, the record did get made - there are no contractual headaches for the participants, and no A/R man to not hear a single. I also love and greatly appreciate that John Young has enough passion to have seen this through, and then the determination to seek out ears he suspects may be friendly - and boy, was he right.    Lifesigns is a tremendous listening experience - it reminds me of all the reasons that, yes, I do love prog rock. It's extremely well written, the playing is superbly engaging, tones are tweaked to perfection, and the vocals are just amazing - Young's voice is a tenor in the tradition of the angels Wetton and Gabriel, and Beggs's roof raising harmonies are magical. Each song sounds like a hit single in mini-album length - got it?    Esoteric Antenna, a division of the dependable Cherry Red Records had the moxy to realize and release this record, and it seems to be breaking out nicely, with great first reviews - include this in the raves.    Lighthouse sets things in motion, and it's complex, flavorful, and chewy - Young provides melody galore with both his vocals and his keyboard work is endlessly engaging. Beggs and Beedle frolic rather wildly underneath to create a delicious stew. The intro is enthralling - a lovely soundscape that prepares the ear for what's to come. Into the first verse, and it's clear that the trip is a good trip. Classically British prog with healthy amounts of pop melody - everyone on board has long, long resumes filled with a proper roadmap to this new location, and the sound is very new, but familiar. Like meeting a long lost friend for the first time. Guitars throughout the body of the song are provided by the one and only Steve Hackett, and I say that with great specificity - Hackett is not only the guy making the most regularly engaging music currently coming out of England, he's also amazingly busy, and that he took the time to participate here speaks grand volumes. Robin Boult signs on to unleash a guitar solo towards the end of the tune that fits like a glove, and provides a lovely trail into the sunset. Friends of classic prog will find heaps to love here.    Substrata bass and some nicely reverberated jungle drums plough a deep furrow into which John Young lays down more melodic wonderment on Telephone. Beggs and Beedle are a fantastic rhythm section - their inventive jousting is the perfect terrain for Young's melodic soundscapes. The harmonies here make me miss classic Yes tremendously, and session wiz and occasional Fripp bandmate Jakko Jakszyk puts down some tasty guitar harmonies and fills. Young's vocals fit his songs perfectly - he employs some deft phrasing, and his dynamics show that all that time spent around great singers has paid off. Ten minutes have never slipped by so pleasantly, and again, this record is so captivating that my attention span is never taxed. These tunes build like orchestral masterworks, ever spiraling upwards.    Fridge Full of Stars is a cinematic number - Young seems to possess an endless supply of melodic invention, and the production and backing is amazingly simpatico - Hackett throws down a fabulous but too brief acoustic guitar solo, but I'm let down only for seconds until Beggs gets busy under the next verse with a virtuosic bass performance that almost but not quite overtakes the song - then the harmonies and sophisticated song craft again take center stage. Focus mainman Thijs Van Leer stops by to provide a soulful flute interlude as Young and band delicately weave a hypnotic underpinning. After the ethereal instrumental section, the band takes things even higher and the layering of voices, instruments, and atmosphere sends the song into another orbit completely. This album should come with an oxygen mask.    At just over eight minutes, At The End of the World is the album's shortest number, and I find myself wishing it were longer - this is all about the art of songwriting, and musicianship. At the risk of sounding repetitive the melodies and harmonies are lovely, the accompaniment picture perfect.The tones captured across the whole of the record are fantastic, and it is revealed that grown up rock is a good, good thing. Everything here indicates proper dosages of skills, experience, and true inspiration - nobody here is mailing it in, this is being performed for keeps.    Carousel enters the world with the hottest guitar solo on the record, but it's not - it's Nick Beggs letting fly on the Chapman Stick, and I've just got to say that the appearance of the man's name is enough to get me to buy any record one which he appears. The prog rock hallmark of good taste. The set close features the most sophisticated musical interplay on the album, and John Young's keyboard wizardry is astounding. It's so brilliant that it has a way of disarmingthe listener - he's so melodic and musical that you seldom feel the tension that can exist when a keyboardist sets off into his imagination. You can hear the care taken to make certain that the notes serve the song and not the opposite.    Lifesigns is one of the coolest gifts to cross my desk yet this year - I hope John Young and company are able to parlay this into a spate of touring, shows, and a follow up record. This record is an hour of excellent listening. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy, set back and enjoy the trip.    Tony Conley - Rock Guitar Daily

B003O86FMW|5.0|As the first, this was a GREAT book.  A bit repetative but also very good.  Can hardly wait for the movie!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A very easy read, but to repetitive.  Folks have  going on and on about the sex sections...while they were plentiful, they could use more variety in the description.  I did enjoy the characters and I like the tension and chemistry developed.  I'll probably finish the trilogy...although I can see the fairy tale end already.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  Loved it.  I could not put it down.  It sucks you right in from the beginning.  The characters are AWESOME!  I highly recommend this book.  Reading it is time well spent.
B009369Z8A|4.0|I odrered this movie based on the tv ad it was good but not what I thought it would be like.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read everything from this author.  My only complaint is that she hasn't written enough books!  Dark Places is extremely dark and delicious.  This woman's mind is terrifically twisted!  I was surprised that she herself actually had a normal childhood.  Which is just a testament to her wonderful imagination.  Please don't miss this fantastic writer!  I can not wait to see what she puts out next!!
B009MF5BXK|4.0|I have The Expendable and like the action and content looking forward to watching this one as soon as I can find some time.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I SO loved this book.  Warning - it is dark, so if you do not like that, choose something else.  However, if you like psychological thrillers, this book is definitely for you.  I read Gone Girl by this author first.  I totally fell in love and immediately read every novel she has written.  Sharp Objects did not disappoint!  I highly recommend this book - and I have, to everyone!!  Thank you Gillian Flynn!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is the real thing. I bought another elsewhere, but it was a cheap knockoff. This is great or should I say &#34;this is it&#34;
B00190OHD6|5.0|Great movie -watched it on a girl's weekend away and we all loved it.  Would watch it again - glad we rented it

B005VOXOYO|5.0|The toy is perfect and is shown in a great style of the falcon about to take off. He is perfect in color and features.

0761171703|5.0|Beautiful photography. The locations are very interesting and the actions look organic and not forced. I recommend this book to all those interested in dance.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|I've enjoyed this book, I find the ideas discussed within very compelling. That said, I found some of the early chapters a bit self-indulgent. He refers to personal slights or opinions that are not important in the narrative, something I don't remember from the Black Swan (one of favourite books of the past decade).<br /><br />This may change in time, all in all its a great book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is so easy.  I love it.  I have managed to organize my life while on the go.  I recommend it to everyone big and small.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed this episode due to the Super Bowl and it was well worth $1.99 to view it the following day!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|definitely worth the free download.  kept me occupied on the plane for a solid two hours.  a a a a a a a
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. It was a very riveting novel.<br />I look forward to comparing the novel to the upcoming movie.<br />Usually the novels are better.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|We loved the movie at the theater.  We couldn't wait to watch it again at home...several times...and then dig into the special features.  Many dvd specials offer only cuts of actors slapping each other on the back.  This one, however, gives you the director and writers unfolding their ideas day-by-day.  You get to see the genesis of the plot and understand what direction future episodes just might unfold.
B002EEP3NO|4.0|Buy it now.If you are looking at it,BUY IT NOW.<br />This was so much fun to build and looks awesome done and displayed.<br />Lego fans will enjoy all others will learn to enjoy as they gaze upon its awesomeness .
B005AERS74|5.0|Love this song as well as so many other Maroon 5 music. You almost can not go wrong with Maroon 5.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the \\"world\\" created in the series so far.  Sad to say it's only half of the  cycle and I need more now!  Loved the characters and emotional in sites given.  Highly recommended.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|this app is great! it is fast, quick, good for checking problems. if you need a calculator that is an app, take this one.
0345525558|5.0|I read this book and immediately ordered in for myself. It was so good, I ended up giving it away to a special friend for her birthday. She loved it!!! Another friend read it too and said it was awesome. We are all happy!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you're of a certain age, you remember where you were and what you were doing on 11/22/63 (much like 9/11/01).  I haven't read any Stephen King novels for quite a while because some stories were too far out there for me.  I really enjoyed the story and the research that went into this novel.  It was difficult to put down, much like &#34;The Stand&#34; (the first Stephen King novel I read).
0307948110|5.0|Great story all the way to the end. Gave a glimpse into genius on a level most of us can only read about and stand in awe.<br />The pace of the book is a fast read.<br />I really enjoyed this book!
B00005UW7V|4.0|I got this movie for my sister for Christmas.  She loves it and ocassionally watches it from time to time.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynnn never disappoints!  Another page turner until you just can't read anymore.<br />We really know the character, Mitch Rapp, and fall in love all over again, book after book!
B004FHBO9K|3.0|OK I guess, since I haven't listened to it yet as it was a gift, but you asked.  2 more words
B00BA5H3TU|4.0|If fans of Riverside are put off by this release because they think it is some drastic departure from their sound or some such thing, I have to wonder how true of fans they were. Shrine of New Generation Slaves may not be as complex or metalish as previous Riverside albums, but it is still a great album filled with great music that takes you places beyond listening to mere music. I personally do not think this album is quite as good as earlier and highly regarded albums like Anno Domini High Definition or Second Life Syndrome (my personal favorite), but that is not to say that it is not a great album. Bits and parts of the music sound like throwbacks to the days of 70's and 80's rock and metal, but never do I think this is not a Riverside album first and foremost.<br /><br />I give this album 4 stars for the music, the Amazon presentation of this album gets 0 stars. Almost $20 for this album and it's not even listed right. I got this for $13 off eBay and the song \\"Coda\\" is not on the second disc. The second disc is supposed to contain two 10+ minute tracks called Night Session - Part One and Night Session Part Two. Get it right Amazon, it just looks plain ridiculous to list a 1:39 long song as the \\"second disc\\" and then charging double album price for it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I read this book because of recommendation on twitter and facebook. The characters/story is intense. The struggles Abby and Travis go through in their past and present. The fighting, the controling, the drunking, the gambling, the sex and so much more. It is not a fairy tale book at all, but there are good things in the book also.  There were momments I was yelling, I was crying, and I was struggling/hurting. It is up to the reader to take what they want from the story.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|It is has rarely been done that a musical had been turned into a movie effectively. This is one of the bet adaptations I have seen.
1452110581|5.0|If you are one to converse with your kitty, this is the book for you.  Laugh you will. I believe my Bamboo and Niki shared their thoughts with the poet.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Enjoying catching up with all the characters (soo many characters!).<br />Really wondering how all the storylines are going to come together.
1449305172|5.0|I am currently implementing lean product development practices at work, and have read literally a dozen books on this topic.<br /><br />Ash's book is the best, hands down.<br /><br />If you are going to buy one book on Lean, this is it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A wonderful story but be prepared to cry.  I would recommend this for a friend.  I have to add more words per their requirement - It's irritation.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|Uma Thurman & more star in Quentin Tarantino's 2003 & 2004 action films.<br />A woman seeks revenge for getting attacked on her wedding day. Uma<br />is great in these and both films have nice picture and sound plus some<br />neat extras. I recommend this good double feature set.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I've heard such great things about this book that I knew eventually I'd have to read it. When it went on sale at Amazon, I snapped it up. And I'm glad I did. I award this book 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Anna, the star of Anna and the French Kiss, is shipped off to a French boarding school for her senior year. She is lonely and friendless, but immediately finds a good friend in Meredith, a girl in her dorm. From there, she meets St. Clair, who she is drawn to the moment they meet. Then she finds out that he has a girlfriend that he's been with FOREVER. What transpires next is her journey not only navigating the tricky waters of adolescent love, but finding herself, and what it means to be a true friend.<br /><br />I really loved this book. The biggest reason I do is because of Anna herself. She is a terrific protagonist, flawed, but likeable, and grows throughout the book as she realizes things about herself and how she interacts with other people. The dialogue and prose is witty, sharp, and clear, and I couldn't stop reading until the end even though I desperately needed sleep. I loved all of the characters and everything seemed so real to me. I loved the descriptions of Paris and the places that Anna visited. I know now why everyone gushes about this book, because it really is a gem.<br /><br />There's only one small thing that is more of a personal observation than anything else. How many of you have had a St. Clair in your past? I just have my doubts about how this all resolved from my own experience, but I'll have to leave it at that to not put any spoilers up here.<br /><br />Overall, a witty and beautifully written YA contemporary novel with a winning protagonist.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Bit of a stretch. time to retire this series which has been very entertaining in the past. this one seemed like watching someone else play a video game.
B007THA4FI|5.0|No one writes characters like J.K. Rowling.  Although this is a drastic move away from wizards and quidditch matches the characters and intertwining storylines are just as fascinating.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Love it!  This is slightly different from your classic Grisham novel - I loved it just as much.  He's infused some humor in this one.  Read it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldnt put this book down. Im sooooo glad i didnt listen to the bad reviews. Ive read it three times and im still not bored. Must read. I wish the author would come out with another one!
1449410243|5.0|I bought 2 of these books to give to friends who have cats, but are not crazy cat people. I ended up reading it cover to cover before wrapping it! The illustrations are hilariously cute and the stories/advice/warnings were laugh out loud funny. A great gift for a cat owner, although it is certainly geared to a certain audience. Not for your grandmother (unless she's pretty hip) and not for someone who takes life too seriously.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Once I have my inbox open, The drop down to move to other sections such as compose, trash, saved, isn't shown. In other words, I can CHECK the emails but I can not send new ones out, unless its a response to the mail I'm checking. I didnt want to have to move to gmail to sync my email accounts but it looks like Im going to HAVE TO in order to even SEND a email from my kindle...<br /><br />If this one thing was fixed, it would be PERFECT for me..<br /><br />Hope this issue gets addressed soon....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is really a 6 star performance. Many stories within stories, it evokes humor, pathos. In the middle of the 2nd season and can't wait to see more.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|The trilogy series, The Maze Runner, was an action packed, edge of your seat read. This prequil is a perfect way to end the series. You knew the end and now we know the beginning. Great read & great series!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Bought this for my son for his birthday because he loves this movie.  the picture is great and we love it
0142501123|5.0|This is a whimsical book with fun colorful pictures and an addicting cadence that me and my two children love!
B008TTPQXA|4.0|endorses what our ancient hindu philosophy has always emphasised . written well . western thought has always apposed reincarnation and  after life. his near death experience sounds authentic enough
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an addicting game. Hard to put down!I only wish you had a few seconds to regroup after falling before the cop gets to you.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD. It's similar to a soduko puzzle with colors in place of numbers. There have been many updates with new puzzles, and they now have random generators at each difficulty level. I'm on a smaller screen smartphone - so it's definitely possible - but at higher difficulty if you play too long you can definitely start to go a little cross-eyed! Overall I'd say if you enjoy soduko type logic puzzles it's worth a purchase.
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|THIS APP COULD BR GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I PUTCHASED THIS VERSION TO UNLOCK FEATURES THAT THE FREE APP DIDN'T HAVE AND THE EQUALIZER FEATURE KEEPS FORCING CLOSE ON MY MOTOROLLA TRIUMPH.<br />PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE, THAT WAS MY REASON FOR BUYING THE PAID VERSION OTHER THAN THAT, EVERYTHING IS IS GOOD.
B009EAALII|5.0|My husband and I went to see Chris Isaak in concert and we just loved him, so I knew that this would make a great Christmas gift.

0525953728|5.0|A no-nonsense SEAL using an assumed name has written about his years in DEVGRU.  He had the ultimate mission at the end of his career.  He and his team executed the killing of Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />The book is very matter-of-fact.  Mark Owen describes the intense training a SEAL undergoes. The average SEAL really has no life outside of his job.  It is a very intense, focused life.  Mark gives it up after 10 years.  He is burned out and wants to have a more normal life.<br /><br />After all the hype concerning the Bin Laden raid, it is refreshing to read an account written by someone who was actually there.<br /><br />The proceeds from this book are being used to support organizations that benefit wounded SEALS.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am really picky about the shows I watch.. only certain shows hold my attention, so my list of must see series is pretty small.. but Downton Abbey is  at the too of the list. I have not missed an episode yet.  It only takes one episode for you to get caught up in all the characters in the show.. so much is going on all time.. it is simply a GREAT show.
