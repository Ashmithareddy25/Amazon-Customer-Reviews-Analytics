B007IXWKUK|5.0|I bought this online because the wait was entirely too long at the Library and anyone else who owned a copy had already lent it to someone else. You could say I was desperate to know \\"what next?\\"<br /><br />Definitely a page turner...
1594744769|4.0|I put off reading this book for a long time because it just didn't seem like the sort of thing I'd like to read. But after many, many friends singing the praises of this novel I finally gave it a try. All the praise was worth it! Fully engrossing, utterly creepy, and thought-provoking, it is a novel of the highest caliber. I highly recommend it!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|North by Northwest was originally released to theaters in the summer of 1959 by MGM and was directed by mastermind Alfred Hitchcock, one year before [[ASIN:0783225849 Psycho (Collector's Edition)]] was released.<br /><br />Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive, is mistaken for George Kaplan and is kidnapped by two men who take him to a house in Long Island to be interrogated by a man claiming to be Lester Townsend, when he is actually a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm. Roger keeps telling him that he has the wrong person, but Vandamm doesn't believe him and order his men to get rid of Roger. They force him to drink bourbon and put him behind the wheel of a car. Then the men chase after him, hoping that Roger will crash the car, but to their surprise, he gets away.<br /><br />Knowing that he had no prove of what had happened, Roger decides to stop Vandamm from doing whatever he has planned to do. Roger had overheard that Vandamm was going to Chicago, so he hops on a train where he meets a lovely young woman, Eve Kendal, who turns out to be Vandamm's girlfriend.<br /><br />After getting off the train, Roger needs to travel by bus, but he first has to wait for one to appear along a countryside road. That's when the famous crop-duster scene occurs; diving down toward the very road Roger is on. It seems that no matter where he goes there are people after him.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002W7J3SO North By Northwest]] is a cleverly written thriller that takes you from New York to the top of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in cinema history and his direction alone makes the movie standout from all others. There are great performances by screen-legends Cary Grant and James Mason that highlight this mistaken identity tale. The movie may be over fifty years old, but it is better than any movie released to theaters today. Men will like the espionage plot while women will enjoy the romance scenes between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Besides for some mild violence, the movie is a clean-cut film, so older kids can enjoy watching this classic movie too..

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|There are not many books on my reread list, but this one will be there.  This book is just absolute fun.  A combination of the best of gaming, music, movies and books  for a kid of the 80's.  I would think MMO story line would appeal to those into gaming today.  All in all, this was a very fun read with more story crammed into its pages than most books I have read.  I look forward to more books from Mr. Cline.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I picked up this book with a little aprehension and an equal dose of curiosity because of all the hype it was getting. There was a lot of \\"This is the best book evarrrr!!!111\\" type enthusiasm going so I decided to see if the book lived up to the hype. After reading it the first time through, I understood why everyone and their best friend thought this book was the best thing since sliced bread; however, I don't really know how I feel about the book as a whole, to be honest.<br />Patrick Rothfuss's writing is excellent. This isn't to say it completely lacked nerve-grinding bits of purple prose or that he was always smooth with his info-dumps, but his prose is clear, precise and has a nice fliud feel to it. I know that if Rothfuss ever decided to write a novel about the molecular details of peeling paint, I'd gladly buy it. The book is very readable, engaging, and raises some interesting questions about the boundary between myth and fact. I really love that the main character is debunking myths about himself.<br />I however, find myself really disliking the main character. It's not that he isn't interesting, but he just suffers from a severe case of man-of-awesome, meaning everything from women to fate and the world will eventually prostrate themselves at his feet. I have nothing to root for because he'll just end up brushing his problems away like bread crumbs when the time is right. No, I do not mind his arrogance because I feel it adds to the intriguing question of whether or not he's fully telling the truth. I mind that the hero is so superduperawesomesocks that he makes for a very interesting person, but a bland character to read about.

B005B0QYMM|3.0|Found footage screamers have been around long enough to develop their own unique set of stereotypes, and this one carries an armload of them. In following a small group of boldly stupid reality TV producers, out to capture cheap footage of supernatural events, it uncovers the requisite amount of creepy crawlies and recycled scares by way of night vision lens and shaky hand-held camera. It deserves credit for finding a great setting (an abandoned mental institution that might be a cliche if it weren't so effective) and for resisting the urge to go completely over the top during the closing scenes. Too many good setups of this kind are blown on an indulgent final act, (Paranormal Activity, I'm looking at you here) so it's nice to see one that's able to keep its chills relegated to short, efficient bursts. The entire cast is thoroughly unsympathetic, though, and their intrepid leader is the worst of the worst. May not tread any new ground, but it also doesn't stumble over any tripwires.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great album! ADELE is one of my favorite artists and her album 21 showcases her voice. Definately a great buy!
B008MM9630|5.0|I really love this game. the graphics are very good and the animation runs smoothly. you DO NOT have to purchase in game money, you can do plenty with out it. however, all the animals cost gems except one. gems are easy to obtain,  but it takes a lot of them to get any good animals worth having.

B004L03B3S|5.0|Interesting film on a controversial topic. The acting is very natural and the topic is dealt with sensitively. Beautifully shot in Brazil. However, the part depicting the brothers' childhood is a bit too long even if it's necessary to clearly show how their bonding came to be. A romantic general overtone (which I loved). An interestingly ambiguous end....recommendable...
B005HSL626|3.0|this game would be fun if it weren't for all the fruits. I mean come on those fruits and potatoes are always in your way when your trying to swipe the blade. if it would let me just swipe the blade on a blank screen it would get my five stars. but nope ... stupid fruits and potatoes.
B00338QENI|4.0|This was an book club choice that I really enjoyed.  It is a true story which leaves the reader with a lot of moral and what's ethical issues to ponder.  The author was able to personalize the story of a woman whose cancer cells were taken and used to further research without any benefits for her family.  I learned a lot about cells and how they grow and how scientists are dedicated to research.  It is also a look at medical procedures in the early 1950's before we had patient consent forms to fill out and how the procedures have changed over the years. Some of my book club friends felt it dragged in places, but I found it to be a book that I had trouble putting down.  The author spent ten years getting to know the story and Lacks family.  It was well researched and I liked her style of writing.
0439023521|5.0|I have seen this book around in a few book magazines countless of times and I always made sure I avoid it. I thought it would be a boring empty story that boys would read BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!<br />I decided to give it a chance after hearing about the movie coming out and whatnot and the trailor looked interesting so I bought it and fell head over heels in love with this book and series. I cant believe I spent two years of my life avoiding this book just because of the cover. You know what they say... don't judge a book by it's cover. This is one of the best books I have ever read probably the best. ...... I love the characters especially peeta (if only every boy was like that))  and of course rue and katniss. I cannot wait for the movie to come out on the 18th. I would suggest to everyone to read these books and hopefully you'll love them as much as I did
0307341577|5.0|I don't want to take away from this book by writing all of my thoughts, but I can say, for someone like myself, who reads an average of 2 books a week - I have never been so engrossed in a story. This novel was well-written, has an amazing plot and the most pathetic (I mean this in a good way) characters, who's stories will keep you guessing until the end. I would recommend this book to anyone. It was very hard to put down and since reading it; I have had a hard time finding another story that can compare to how great this is. (See Jennifer McMahon's \\"Island of Lost Girls\\" for a similar read)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has been reviewed in the local newspaper and on every talk show and recommended to me my by sister-in-law as she joked about the amount of sex.  I am glad to have read it-yes, there's lots of detailed sex, but I really liked the story line about this couple.  Sometimes it's hard to believe that a young woman today would get into this situation, but I remember when I was that age and do believe it's possible.  I thought the author was able to show how the past affected this man and how he was challenged to change his perceptions.  The three books make up one story (which is an annoying marketing strategy)but it does have a satisfying ending.  I thought it was a great read.

B008QE9VJI|2.0|I have to admit I am both a big fan of the original series and Tim Burton. I think \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" was one of the best movies I've seen in my whole lifetime. Loved \\"Sweeney Todd,\\"and I generally have a very high regard for Mr. Burton's work. But this movie, comparisons with the original series aside, is just plain awful. It lacks plot, and seems to be anchored down by its attempts to make references to the original series.<br /><br />I guess the really frustrating thing here is if you were going to reach back to the original series for material there were at least 8000 storylines & subplots that you could have drawn from. Unfortunately Seth Graham Greene chose to disregard all of those and gave us a sophomoric script that's a combination between the TV series Dallas and the previous Burton movie Beetlejuice. Seriously, the goings-on between Angelique and Barnabas remind me of the antics and sibling rivalry between Bobby Ewing and JR Ewing. As hard as Johnny Depp tries to make the material work, he just can't.<br /><br />Anybody older than 12 is going to be totally annoyed by Chloe Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard. There's just absolutely nothing likable about this character and nothing in her performance to make you care one lick about what happens to her or the rest of the family. Eva Green is totally miscast as Angelique, and Michelle Pfeiffer - who is one of the finest actresses in Hollywood - seems to be completely wasted on this material. That goes double for Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />The movie does have a couple of nice moments. Watching the opening titles with Victoria Winters riding a train into Collinwood, set to the Moody Blues \\"Nights in White Satin\\"was sort of breathtaking. And surprisingly, Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis is the bright spot in this mess of a movie. He truly is funny and got some belly laughs... more than once.<br /><br />I don't know who to be madder at. Seth Graham Greene, or Tim Burton. But I waited 50 years for someone to do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer. No one seems to have figured out that one of the reasons the original series worked is there were always two story lines going at the same time. It never was all about Barnabas Collins. There was Elizabeth Stoddard and Jason Maguire. And then there was Barnabas and Maggie Evans. The interplay between the two story lines is what made the series so interesting. In the 1700s it was Barnabas and Angelique, and Vicky and Peter Bradford, and I can go on. Etc. etc.<br /><br />They used the excuse that they needed to update the story for modern audience. I am insulted. Next time, How about a little bit of imagination and ingenuity?do a decent treatment of Dark Shadows, and I guess I'll have to wait a little while longer.

B000R8YC1S|5.0|With the movie Labyrinth being a well-recalled part of my youth, it was a real treat to find this DVD anniversary edition.  The movie looks just as good as it ever did, and really brings back the sense of wonder and excitement it originally engendered.  David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly are an engaging pair in this tale of a young girl attempting to solve the Goblin King's labyrinthine maze to find and reclaim her 'kidnapped' baby brother.<br /><br />An exciting bonus is the special features which include interviews with cast and crew, an inside look at Jim Henson's creatures and several segments on the making of the movie.  Highly recommended for adventuresome types young and old!

B003B02O14|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There are numerous surprises along the way, but nothing like the surprise at the end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read this year. It has a fast moving plot with full on drama and can't lay it down capabilities. Jamie Mcguire is a new literary force to be reckoned with. The chemistry between Travis and Abby is captivating and leaves you wanting more. There are twists and turns until the end. You won't be disappointed.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This was an awesome addition to the series but if you haven't read any of the books I would still read this book last even though it is the prequel. Part of the enjoyment of the series is that you are just as much in the dark about what is going on as the characters. The books are a journey that solves/resolves those unanswered questions. To me that was part of what really made these books so good.<br /><br />(TINY SPOILER ALERT) This book gives us some of the memories that Teresa regained (she's Deedee for those who missed that bit). (SPOILER END)<br /><br />I got this book and finished it in one day, really good book.

B001STDRZC|4.0|The reviews I read on this product before purchasing it said it was a really funny movie, and it is!  From the start, you can tell something is up and it's no holds barred hilarity from many cleverly (or not so cleverly) disguised stars of SNL!  The plot is reminiscent of \\"School of Rock\\", but takes the situation in a different direction, while amplifying the differences between past and present musical styles.  The movie features the parenting team of Jane Lynch and Jeff Garlin (from \\"Sleepover\\") and Christina Applegate really out of character as a somewhat overprotective mom.  The gags are sometimes cliche, but not always, and fairly enjoyable, except for the pocket of puke scene (blech).  Otherwise...<br /><br />Rainn Wilson is very charming and endearing (not nearly as creepy as Dwight Schrute, his character from \\"The Office\\") as he portrays an aging 80's rocker who was NEARLY famous before being axed from his band at the height of their popularity.  Twenty years later, he is unexpectedly given another chance to rock and make a run for the top with his nephew and his band!  Will they succeed?  Will uncle get axed again?  Can the young hipster set roll with an older, hard rock drummer?  It's a fun ride, so why not get the DVD and find out?

B003F3FJQO|5.0|After reading the Mazerunner I was incredibly interested how Dashner would go about the second book. As I read through The Scorch Trials I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was hard for me to it put down. I was pleased that Dashner added some wonderful twists and turns to the story to keep it as enjoyable as the first book and still had me guessing what the outcome would be throughout it all. I would recommend this book and the other two books of this trilogy!

B002M2N9JI|5.0|The self-titled CD \\"La Roux\\" is truly one worth listening to.  It is a rare find to listen to an entire CD and not feel compelled to skip at least a few songs.  This peppy, upbeat, dub-step album is the happy exception!  I can set the entire CD on repeat and enjoy every track.<br /><br />La Roux distinguishes themselves by producing songs with intelligent, meaningful lyrics overlayed with an 80's synth-pop sound that really works well.  The songs are danceable and fun!  While La Roux brands themselves as 80's synth pop, it is worth noting that the music is dub-step, so there are no heavy bass lines or pounding drum fills like actual 80's music.  However, what is present is electronically masterful, highly liestenable and just plain enjoyable.

There were so many discrepancies in the story that you could try to attribute to the main characters' pension for lying, yet to me it just felt like pure laziness on the author's part. That said, the story was somewhat entertaining.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Lots of writers set up intrigueing setups. Most fail to offer satisfying payoffs. In Wool Hugh Howey does both. And still manages to leave you with more questions.

034580404X|5.0|I had fun with these books.  True, they aren't literature but they are perfect for beach reading.  E. L. James came up with a very interesting predicament for her heroine in her first book.  Christian Grey is perfect in almost every way -- except one.  It was interesting to see how their relationship developed in spite of this huge problem.  I enjoyed the books.  However, I cannot imagine how they will ever make them into a movie. I can't believe there is anyone who could play Christian Grey, especially considering everyone has their own image of him in their imagination.  Nope, I sure don't envy the casting director.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|The movie is bad. it really is. they had a good concept of the gang reuniting. every one except jim's mom-more on that later. and a good format of a high school reunion. now lets get to it: 1st, the introduction of the characters are badly done-for example, there on the beach and heather along with vickie just appear out of nowhere come on. there introductions should have been better put in the film. second, the revenge of stifler on the beach with the ice chest was too corny and crucial and unrealistic. he should have just pooped in the cooler and that was it. third, the part where they take the drunken girl home to sneak her back into her house was poorly done.they car brake down and the father says nobody has cell phones and the wife says u were on celebrity dance off ane he lets them in. that part of the film was funny but poorly set up. and the long running gag with oz as the dancer on the game show was eh so and so. but the scene in karas room was funny but once again poorly done. also, back to jims mom. they wrote her out in a way that made sense which gave eugene which is jims dad more to work with which he did.  the movie is bad. but to the good stuff: the movie opens good. the references homage to the first film is good like michelle and jim at stifler party because that was the first time they boned each other. and the milf references with the two buddies reuniting was great. the band camp references was ok. back to the bad eueryone is on the cover except nadia. they should have replaced the baby and the bottle with nadia to make homage to the first. also the fight at stifler party is the most fun part in the movie ha watch jims dad. jim and stifler mom together was a good idea and stifler and finches mom was good. they should have just said 15 reunion not 13. this film was a letdown.
B007QNRMUU|4.0|Being a huge Jason Mraz album, I was not disappointed at all with this album.  His usual rhythmic melodies and swooning are found all over this album, and his guitar work remains outstanding and breathtaking.<br /><br />For those hoping for (or only knowing) something more like his  first album, you might find this one a little slow/mellow.  I personally miss the more upbeat songs of his such as \\"Waiting For My Rocket To Come\\" and \\"Wordplay\\", which is why I gave this one only four stars instead of the five it probably deserves.<br /><br />All around, though, I still recommend this one.  Mr. A-Z has still got it.  Check it out!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|That wasn't a book.  Nothing of any substance at all in the book.  On the upside, it takes only about an hours to read.  A true waste of money
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|Has helped me improve my game until I learned to predict its throws. Do not know if the economics permits a truly random dice play but this is not it. The statistics are meaningless because there are many doubles thrown or hits made when the game is already decided.  I am not sure that a \\"fair\\" game means 50/50 and backgammon by its nature is not \\"fair\\" as there is randomness built in which includes hot streaks that produce improbable results.  But there are far too many contextual repetitions that I have clocked to suggest this is a random game.  I would say it is worth 99 cents but not a penny more.  And I would pay more for a program.  The graphics and atmospherics are excellent.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing so much about how this book has put female-oriented erotica in the mainstream, my curiosity got the better of me and I disregarded the negative reviews.  Oops.  The only thing erotic about it is the tease - you have to read through hundreds of pages of ridiculous, adolescent romance that promises, but barely delivers, anything juicy.  I counted exactly two scenes in the 'playroom', as well as a couple of mildly fun elevator scenes, but none of them were worth the pages of repetition and bad writing.  And yes, women are hungry for romantic erotica, but this ain't it.  First of all, we'd like to relate to the main character, and I got real tired of a stunningly-beautiful-but-doesn't-know-it 20-something virgin who's never dated but is creative enough to wear a guy's boxers - and to make it worse, the poor dear  'forgets to eat'.  As for the guy, sure, it's great to fantasize about a hunky wealthy hero, but this guy was so ludicrous I thought I'd stumbled across a novelization of that old \\"My Dream Date\\" game.  Plus you gotta laugh at the unimaginative names.  Ana is way too close to anal, Christian is an odd choice for someone with such kinky tastes, and 'Steele' and 'Gray' (with their respectively 'steely' and 'gray' eyes - huh?) belong in an episode of the Avengers.<br /><br />Come on, can't someone do better than this?  The success of this waste of time, money, and ink is just an indication of how hard up women are for ANYTHING remotely erotic, particularly if it helps them admit that BDSM is a common fantasy.  Maybe I'll have to write an erotic novel about what really turns on most busy women - the simple fact of not having to plan anything.  (There's the true fantasy - if we're tied up in someone's 'playroom', at least it means we aren't driving carpool, deciding what to make for dinner, paying bills, or cleaning the house.)
0307957934|2.0|I had such high hopes for this novel.  Say what you will, Robert Harris knows how to write.  Unfortunately, The Fear Index was a real letdown.  The story revolves around Dr. Max Hoffman, an American ex-pat living in Switzerland.  He's left the world of physics for the world of high-finance.  His science background allowed him to create an algorithm-driven hedge fund, one that's based on the psychology of fear, and one that's outperforming just about every other investment out there.<br /><br />Hoffman's immense wealth can guard against many things, but it can't guarantee complete security.  The novel opens with a fairly terrifying home invasion.  Hoffman scares off the intruder, but not before he sustains a head injury.  It's bad timing, however.  This is a pivotal moment for the business, and with a major investor's meeting looming that day, he doesn't have the luxury of slowing down.  However, as the day goes on, Hoffman is discovering more and more bizarre incidents that have been happening around him, to the point that he's questioning his sanity.  Because it comes down to this--either he's losing his mind, or someone's trying to convince him that he is.  And what, if anything, does all this have to do with the prior night's break in?<br /><br />Now, that sounds like a good set up to a thriller, but truthfully, the plot felt like rehashed, watered-down Crichton.  The big reveal that the entire book was leading up to couldn't have been less of a surprise.  It actually felt quite clich&eacute;d.  And if that weren't bad enough, the characters in the novel weren't especially likeable, interesting, or well-drawn.  Any of them.  As always, this made caring about their story significantly more difficult.  Even the pacing of this thriller lagged.  While Harris's prose is not bad, with neither the characters, the plot, nor the science at the heart of this novel proving to be a draw, I can't recommend reading it.

B0037DBM86|5.0|Yhis album will be appreciated most by fans of Tool and the Deftones.  The album is simply brilliant, from the first note to the very last.  Trust me when I say the 30 second clips you hear here cannot do any song enough justice.  Listen to the clip for \\"All I Know\\" then check out the video on YouTube to see what I mean.  This album is simply fantastic and with every penny.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|All of the \\"Outlander\\" series books (7) are wonderful, I love the detail the author gives as she weaves her story.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have heard a lot of different points of view on this series, but when my daughter suggested I give it a read, I did.  I think the series had a great flow to it.  Each book led into the other effortlessly.  The characters were well developed and I had no problem giving them faces in my mind.  While the story itself is largely sexually graphic, there is not much of it that is not identifiable by any one really. From my college educated, though a bit naive 21 year old daughter, to myself, also college educated, and sexually seasoned, appreciation for the story was shared.  It was not cheesy, as some would suggest, and it was physically arousing.  I think because I went into it with an open mind, I was able to appreciate the story as it unfolded.<br /><br />James' use of her handy thesaurus is by far the best utilization of the tool I have seen so far.  Well done!
B002RI9VVM|3.0|This is a lovely, innocuous little ebook.<br /> it takes up hardly any space in my readers memory and it seems to perform just as well as ebooks of much more modern titles. Amazing thet they could foresee the technology from way back then but there you go
0525952616|3.0|Daniel Suarez's first two novels, Daemon and Freedom (tm), turned me into a fan.  Therefore, I was excited to learn of the publication of a new stand-alone thriller.  I did not find Kill Decision to be as strong as Suarez's prior novels, but I'm still a fan.  I can't help it; I'm a sucker for smart fiction.<br /><br />This time around, Suarez is writing about the threat of autonomous drones being used by the military.  After several opening scenes which illustrate the dangers of these devices, the story builds around a military man on a secret mission to investigate a series of drone attacks on U.S. soil and a scientist who gets caught up in the action.  She researches ant behavior--but it seems that her pure research has other, darker applications.  Now these two are teamed up with, well, a team.  They need to stay alive, stop the drone attacks, and hopefully get the military to see that machines can't be trusted to make life or death decisions.<br /><br />Now, that's a fairly sparse synopsis coming from me, and you may have noticed that I used no names.  I didn't really see the point.  The characters were so superficially drawn that I could barely remember who the supporting characters were, and the male and female protagonists were awfully generic as well.  I have to admit that I had a very hard time caring about them or getting invested in their story.  Plus, they all had ridiculous monikers like Odin, Mooch, and Foxy.  (Or you'd have a character nicknamed Ripper interacting with a character named Ritter.  Do you really need to make things that difficult, Mr. Suarez?)<br /><br />And it wasn't merely the characters that had a generic feel about them; some of the dialogue was downright cringe-worthy.  An example:  at one point the lady scientist asks the military man why he's drawn to war.  He responds, \\"It's what I'm good at.  And there's a bond you develop with your unit that's hard to find in civilian life.  People you can trust your life to.\\"  Is that, or is that not, one of the most clich&eacute;d exchanges ever written?<br /><br />And one more significant criticism...  While Suarez has written some nice action sequences and some genuinely tense scenes, at some level the action feels tacked on to a tale that's more about talk than tussle.  It's almost as though whenever things grow too static, the author felt the need to throw in some sort of crash or chase or threat, leading to a somewhat contrived feel to the proceedings.<br /><br />At this point, you can certainly be forgiven for wondering what I DID like about the novel.  I liked what I always like about Mr. Suarez's novels:  they're just so darn smart!  In fact, I'd sort of compare Suarez to a favorite writer in another medium, Aaron Sorkin.  Don't get me wrong, Suarez isn't the wordsmith that Sorkin is, but what they have in common is the sheer intelligence they bring to their subject matter, no matter what it is.  And it's that intelligence that draws me in every time.  I couldn't be less interested in the behind the scenes workings of a television sports program, but in Mr. Sorkin's hands, Sports Night was pure gold.  I am similarly disinterested in all things military, drone technology, etc., but Mr. Suarez milks the subject matter for every ounce of interest and fills his novel with passionate speeches ranging from technology to biology to philosophy.  And at these times, his writing is both compelling and lucid.  Simply put, I can't get enough.  I will read about any subject he cares to write about because I know he's going to make it interesting.<br /><br />I do think this is Mr. Suarez's weakest novel to date, however, I'll be reading his next release because I have faith.  He has the tools in place and will continue to learn the craft of writing a thriller.  Beyond that, he has gifts of intellect and curiosity and the ability to connect diverse subjects in fascinating ways that are rare and far less easily acquired.hat not, one of the most clichéd exchanges ever written?<br /><br />And one more significant criticism...

B007STBUIW|4.0|Overall I was impressed with the effort they put into enhancing the detail and coloring of the film.  I mean, for a 37 year old movie, they did a great job!  Except for one scene, and it's not even a real important scene, but it actually looks worse on the Blu-ray than it did on DVD.  It's the scene where Brody, Lorraine, and Hooper are sitting in Brody's dining room talking about the shark and drinking wine.  Looks pretty rough.  Other than that, I'm very excited that this was finally released on Blu-ray.
1451648537|5.0|This is by far one of the best books that I have ever read. The author does a great job giving a detailed description of his roller coaster life. Despite being almost 600 pages, I was able to read this in about four days. I highly recommend this book to all Apple enthusiasts or anyone who wants to learn about one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time.
0345803507|5.0|I never read a book more than once! I think I read all three of these at least twice! I guess it plays on the fantasies of a lot of women in some way or another.

0446547646|3.0|All in all the book was okay. It was a pretty quick and easy read. I adore Nicholas Sparks, however I feel like with this book, he may have run out of ideas. I won't spoil it, but lets just say that pieces of the plot sound a lot like other Sparks books I've read, as well as movies I've seen (not necessarily Nicholas Sparks movies). It will still tug at your heart strigs, however mine have definitely been tugged harder by his previous books.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is such an incredible book series, and the first movie really brought the characters to life. LOVED IT. Got my copy in the mail today and am so excited to watch it again. I will definitely be using AMAZON.COM pre-ordering again the next time a great movie comes out. Thanks Amazon for great service and thank you Suzanne Collins for such a wonderful story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|[[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]]The unabridged version is so much better and as for as questioning the editor, if you don't like the book, get the audiobook...the narrator spells it out for you with emotion. If that does not do it for you, then do not read it. If this book trilogy does not do the justice for you, then you are not alive or have not imagination, which to me means you are too bruised or do not understand English, or you are gay (des not for  people who prefer same sex).  As my 10-year old says, if I do not understand, I use my imagnation. This example does not apply to all, but in this case it does. If you are not ready to use your imagination and are taking things as they are in your life do not read. Or if you too literal do not read.
034580404X|1.0|I have to admit that I only read about eight chapters of the first book and I am thoroughly pissed at myself for being stupid enough to buy my trilogy at Costco (I did save only about two dollars from the Amazon price).  I actually was able to read only the first of the Twilight series \\"novels\\" and although I skipped through the last three chapters of that book, at least I was able to \\"finish\\" it.  \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is not worth the paper it was printed on.  What I was able to stomach was juvenile, mundane, foolish and I feel like an idiot for being over the age of sixteen and reading it.  I am way to old to admit how old I am to have read even more than two pages into this drivel.  Christian and Ana are one dimensional at best and I may be the first to admit that I didn't find his description as sexy at all.  I imagined Ana to be a frumpy, clumsy fool that managed to blush every time Christian looked at her and am I the only one who thought that the first time she got drunk he managed to show up in about sixty seconds after she called him in a bar and essentially made an ass of herself stupid?  Poorly written and I am now poorer for have purchased it and mentally lost IQ points for reading as much as I read.  If this review is stupid, it's because that book made me stupid for even reading as much as I did.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I never thought I would say this, but read Twilight instead if you need a pre-teen \\"fix\\".
034580404X|5.0|Is an excellent purchase, the best book is the first one you will not want it to end, the 2nd and 3rd are not as good, but still is better to have all three of them.

1469984202|5.0|I have always been a reader. One of my co-workers told me about this book and I was intrigued with the description.  I have a Amazon Kindle Fire and love it.  The great thing about these books is that it kept me guessing and it wasn't like some science fiction books that you read that are very \\"oh I knew that was coming\\".  Also the relationship between the characters was very fluid and genuine.  The story really makes you think about things you take for granted because of what is taught to you.  Very interesting metaphor.  I can't wait to read more of his books.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|You can view more detailed maps online, but the biggest disappointment I had with this purchase was that all four books were treated as one. When I buy a boxed set, the covers aren't glued to one another. Similarly, I'd rather not have a 4000 page ebook to have to search through. The combined format also means that highlighting isn't synced with other users who bought the ebooks individually. If you like discovering what other folks found interesting about the books this way, this can be a disappointment.
B004HDJNBI|5.0|I read a long time ago this book and I highly recommend it, it's so sweet the story. The product was in excellent conditions.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|In all honesty prior to the introduction of the HBO series I had never even heard of George Martin or his ongoing A Song of Ice and Fire saga. However in light of the continuous praise and adoration which the television series has garnered I decided to throw myself into this fantasy world and see what it's all about. This past June I picked up the novel \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and chose to read it in its entirety before actually watching the show and I'm glad I did for two reasons: first because it always helps to read the book upon which a television show or film is adapted from (as it gives you a better understanding and appreciation for the visual media) and second because it sparked a passion and love for a written series that I haven't experienced since I picked up Tolkein's works in the early 2000s. It's mid-August now and I'm nearly 200 pages into Martin's third book \\"A Storm of Swords\\".<br /><br />Enough about that though let's talk about the actual show.<br /><br />Although HBO is well known for producing some incredibly popular and award winning programs I feel confident in stating that they've never been responsible for something quite like \\"Game of Thrones\\". This show easily rises above others like The Sopranos, True Blood, Entourage, and Boardwalk Empire and is only matched in its scope and ambition by the unfortunately short-lived Rome.<br /><br />In only ten episodes every single actor and actress manages to generate a performance the likes of which isn't found in most Academy Award-tailored films. Big names like Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings, Silent Hill, Goldeneye), Lena Headey (300), and Mark Addy (The Full Monty) certainly live up to their reputations as minor celebrities but the most noteworthy and truly skilled/sincere performances come from the virtually unknown and rather young cast. One standout is certainly Emilia Clarke who beautifully portrays the evolution of her character Daenerys Targaryen from a timid, frightened girl to easily the most powerful and strong female character of the entire series. Another would be Kit Harington (Jon Snow) who plays the outcast bastard son of Sean Bean's character as he tries to find his place in the world within the Night's Watch but must come face to face with the realities of his choices while attempting to wrestle with his loyalty to the Watch versus his loyalty to his father, brothers, and sisters which he vowed to leave behind.<br /><br />As previously mentioned the scope of the show is larger than most since it has to provide for events and story arcs taking place across a massive continent from the viewpoints of several different characters. Thankfully the writers for the show managed to effectively capture Martin's skill in seamlessly transitioning between all of these within the 50 odd minute time constraints per episode - resulting in a viewing experience that is easy to watch and keep track of. To account for the distinctive changes in location Northern Ireland and Malta proved to be very indispensable for scenes covering the cold North, the fertile south, the exotic Essos, and thriving capital city of King's Landing.<br /><br />In terms of the actual story-line of the series the best way to think of it is taking the political intrigue and merciless back-stabbing of Showtime's \\"The Tudors\\" and \\"The Borgias\\" and setting that inside a fictional fantasy world like the Britannia of Arthurian legends or Tolkein's Middle Earth (minus things like elves, dwarves, orcs, etc). Martin, however, enjoys putting a unique spin on his work that really gives both the novels and the show a kick - mainly the realistic notion that the world is an unjust place filled with selfish, two-faced, and amoral individuals who will go to great lengths to take power or hold on to it...the icing on the cake being that these people usually end up winning while the noble and honor-bound suffer and die as pawns in their schemes. Once the show really gets waist deep in these sinister plots its hard to keep away from it as the drive to know what happens next can easily overcome you.<br /><br />As a Blu-Ray/Home Video release I found myself more pleased with these extras than most. In fact, I hardly ever check out behind-the-scenes clips or featurettes but I was definitely drawn into watching all of these. For the most part the \\"Making Of\\" and other such features are just like any other but what stands out as being the most interesting and worthwhile is the impressively extensive \\"Complete Guide to Westeros\\". Included in this sizable feature are Westerosi legends, histories, geographic information, and other bits of knowledge on the relevant Great Houses all narrated by actors and actresses from the show (namely Michelle Fairley, Issac Hempstead-Wright, and Mark Addy among others). This proves to be an invaluable resource for both those that have never picked up the books or those that have yet to read all five novels in the saga. Just as in the show, Martin chooses to only mention the history of his world through relevant dialogue or events inside the books. Unlike Tolkein there are no ten page tangents about cultures, wars, or folklore and personally I don't like that very much since the result of it is bits and pieces of information scattered throughout different chapters of different books and thus the inability to fully understand or appreciate references made to the past within the show. This Guide however compiles all the background knowledge you'll need in relation to the first season's characters and events.<br /><br />As a final thought I'll just remind any readers that which numerous others have already mentioned: this is a show for adults. It might be fantasy but its \\"dark fantasy\\" - filled with murder, war, foul/sexually explicit language, and nudity/sex....there's ALOT of sex in this season (so much so that it borders on unnecessary in my opinion).<br /><br />Finally, for those out there that are hardcore purists take comfort in the fact that this season plays it pretty close to the source material. Very few liberties are taken with the events and characters as first described in the novel - the most significant of changes being the exclusion of non-critical scenes and dialogue or the addition of scenes to account for inner-monologues and thoughts. Martin himself was incredibly happy with the end product and even goes so far as to say in one of the features that this show is his world come to life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very nice app. Pins are laid out nicely and pictures are CLEAR. Easy to navigate.  Definitely worth the download. Happy Pinning!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had heard that this story was great,but never took an interest. I actually thought I had \\"missed the boat\\" on being so late to read even one of the books.<br />So, I was looking thru my Kindle,hunting for something very different for me to read, and I do love to read multiple stories by one author. The fact that it was the trilogy caught my eye and I entered into \\"The Hunger Games. I could not put it down until I had read all three books. Then I went and saw it in the movies.<br />What an adventure, sad and happy at the same time. Having children killing each other was hard to take, but it was a good story. I feel that I would recommend this futuristic drama to all adults and older children,given to the fact that they could understand the story. I really loved it and it held my interest in being something I might have never read, even thou I loved all of Harry Potter and the Twilight Saga.Its just not for kids.<br />Happy Reading,<br />Kathleen Tillotson
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book was wonderful!  I wa so caught up in the a<br />Story and the characters that I forgot to breath at times.  He does an extraordinary job at bringing you into a different time and world.  The thing that I really love about these books is that he lets the readers know that these were harsh times and no one is safe from death, especially the noble men.  I recommend these books to everyone who will listen!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is super easy to use! no complaints here! I would recommend it to anyone. I haven't used any of the more advanced parts though. just basic math.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the best read I've had since The Hunger Games! No matter how I tried to figure out which direction this tale would take, I was always wrong ( and I am really good and figuring out plot lines). I must have said, \\"WHAT?\\" about twenty times.<br /><br />The writing is smart, clever, and very original. Every reader in my circle has either already read this or they are reading  it now!!<br /><br />Must read!!!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I read this book primarily because of the new A&E television program. I didn't know the author's work but the show interested me enough to explore.  I was riveted by this story the richness of the writing made the characters come alive.  I don't know how involved if at all Craig Johnson is with the show but if not they really should let him contribute as the pace and layers of character development of Walt, Henry and the rest of the regulars just don't do the story justice in the series.<br /><br />I like this book because the writer made the characters seem real to me.  I have never been to Wyoming... but it has been added to my bucket list because of the descriptions of the area.  The friendship between Henry and Walt is real, the book is so enjoyable because of these two characters strengths and flaws make the composite realistic.  I am glad I went back to start reading his series from the beginning.  I am not typically a modern \\"cowboy\\" mystery fan but this keeps you glued from first to the last and the \\"who dunit\\" wasn't obvious from the beginning, so I wasn't bored.  I have started on the second in the series and I am just as pleased.  If you need  a little escape and someone else's drama to let you have break from your own.... this is worth the investment!
030758836X|2.0|It took me forever to get into this book.  It was hard to follow.  The ending was crazy and very unusual.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a Rush fan for some time now but kind of lost my way for a few years. Not that the music was bad but not something I would look to listen to. When it was on I did not turn it off but also didn't give it much thought. This music is different in the way that they seem to be bringing back that side of the band that plays their own instruments distinctively. The bass is strong, guitars are being played in front of the music not just in the back ground and of course the drums are kicken. Give it a try. If you like any Rush at all, you will not be dissapointed and maybe pleasantly surprised.
B004GJYRA0|2.0|I assumed when making this purchase that this movie would be suitable for me to watch along with my two grandsons, ages 6 and 9 years old.  Not so.  It was a good movie but when the sexual activity began showing I had to turn the movie off and try to explain to my grandsons, the best I could for their age, that this is not appropriate behavior for boys and girls the age of the actors. Sorry that I am having to say these things to you but you DID ask, right?  I hope you truely wanted my honest opinion.<br />Thanks.<br />Jane
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. It really helps me keep up with with my battery levels~lets me know when I'm getting low and is very User friendly!

My review is that I love this app!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Game is pretty simple and I ran through the first 300 boards in a few hours; however, it is a fun game that gets your brain going. My only real complaint is that some boards cause you to fill empty space by simply running the line back and forth across the screen a bunch of times; cheap way to make the level more difficult.
B000084T18|2.0|To me 50 cent's very first album \\"Power of a Dollar\\" was more Hip Hop at its purest than \\"GRODT\\". It was more fire on that album though it was unreleased. To this day that album is leaked on the internet! I rather listen to that 50 in '99, he was more hungry and more focused in his music. I dont understand why everyone doesn't look up to that album! It has songs you'll definitely like.
B005IS565S|4.0|This new music from 5FDP is great, not as great as the other cd's in my opinion but is still really good. Not quite as heavy with all songs as the earlier stuff and with a very 80's hair band song thrown in the mix. Overall very good and if you like them as I do, you shold pick it up!

B008OOYALE|4.0|I love dragons, and i love this game. its perfect in every way except a few minor glitches. The only reason i dont rate 5 stars is the update i just tried to install requires me to uninstall the game. Every other game ive had to do that with reset the game, and i lose interest. please fix this and ill happily give it the rating it really deserves.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|I really really wanted to love this book and I did enjoy reading the story.  The Prologue drew me in immediately and I like the world that has been created as it seems very large and diverse.  The story itself was intriguing.<br /><br />However, I felt that there were some weaknesses:<br />I didn't feel that the content really justified the length.  It's good to have character development but a couple of the characters had long sequences of internal navel-gazing and I felt that too often, the inner conflicts of the characters were written with \\"?\\" (Should I do this? Is this right?  Am I a coward? Am I good? etc.)<br /><br />I felt the pacing was really odd and jarring at times.  For example, a few of the consecutive chapters would focus on one character's story then the next chapter would completely switch gear, to another completely new set of names, circumstances and location that was never mentioned before.  A few times as I turned the page I found myself going, \\"wait, what? Am I in another part of the world now? Whose story is this related to?\\"  To be honest, if they made Book 1 Kaladin's Story, Book 2 Dalinar's Story, etc. and if we got to read some of the same sequence from the different characters, I think it would've made more sense and would've been less jarring.  The decision to pop in random chapters really did not add to the flow of the book, especially since some of the chapters also flashbacked to a character's past. Every chapter seemed like a roulette of either continuation from previous chapter, another flashback, or a completely new random sequence.<br /><br />I felt the characters were rather drab.  I don't expect the characters to have multiple personalities but while they were likeable, they felt a little flat.  Even the one that was supposed to a complete badass and yet also completely helpless at the same time felt one-dimensional.<br /><br />I enjoyed the world building and I want to find out more about these lives and the kingdoms but it just did not meet its potential.

B00005N6RU|4.0|This is an astounding film given the technology of the day. NO computer generated birds.  I am very impressed with the special effects in the movie. Like most people I am somewhat jaded by the computer generated special effect of today - it is SO easy today to create a realistic artificial reality.  Shooting this film today would be a piece of cake. Shooting this film when it was shot was a work of art.<br /><br />Aside from the artistry of the film -<br /><br />I like the story. I remember watching this movie when I was a teenager.  If memory serves me correctly, I was NOT particularly impressed with the film - I thought it was a good film and I thought it was scary.  It really scared my sister and to this day she is afraid of groups of birds.<br /><br />This particular version lists an alternate ending - it is NOT really there. A statement is made about an alternate ending being shot, but no filmed alternate ending is present.<br /><br />This particular version also lists a deleted scene  when again there is NO deleted scene, merely a mention of one and some views of a script about this ending.<br /><br />There is a short documentary about the film and I found it to be entertaining. There is also Tippi Hedren's screen test,<br />production photographs, news reels about the film and a trailer - all of which add to the package.<br /><br />If you are a Hitchcock fan this movie is a must see.  If you are a fan of movie magic and movie technological achievements you will appreciate this movie.  This was a difficult movie to shoot and Hichcock and his crew did an extremely good job given the technology of the day.<br /><br />I missed Hitchcock's cameo walk through when I watched the film - saw it on the documentary and will go back to watch it in the film. The film is full of Hitchcock's subtle jokes and add ins.<br /><br />This is a movie I like and a technological achievement which I appreciate. It is worth buying and worth watching.<br /><br />If you buy it in a region 2 format to save a few dollars make sure that your player will play region 2 format DVD's, most US DVD players will NOT.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best military books I've ever read by far my favorite sniper book. I hard a very hard time putting it down once I started reading it. I was on vacation when I started reading it and I didn't want to go do anything cause I was so into the story line.<br /><br />One of the things I liked so much abt it was his wife had her own input into some parts. You would be in the middle of a chapter and it would cut to his wife's side of the story or her thought on his deployments her thought on the Navy Seals or whatever it was she was writing abt.<br /><br />All in all Chris Kyle is one of if the the biggest badasses the US Military has ever produced. If you like books on snipers this is a must read
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 of thesevbooks  not the best writing skills but easy to readd  I downloaded the 3 rd one on my iPad so I wasn't self conscious when I read it at the gym!!  With all the talk going on about being X rated or porn.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've been waiting for this!  this app works well on my kindle fire.  If you like pinterest, this app is for you.
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is very addicting its hard to put down once you start. lots of things to do. and very time consuming
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion makes Bible study even easier! IT doesn't matter if you are going for a quick devotion or an in depth study on scripture. Having many different translations available allows for ease in understanding what the original Hebrew/Greek meant. In addition there are many daily bible plans available so that you can have a reminder set to do a daily devotional and stay in the Word. I would recommend this app to anyone looking to get deeper. Makes a great addition to supplement a Christian walk.
1439102732|5.0|Sad and happy.  It shows racism and tolerance and explains certain human behavior in a sincere and enlightening way.<br />A very good read, thought provoking! Enjoyed it!
B00746TURW|2.0|I purchased this novel because I heard the author being interviewed on the radio and thought it sounded interesting.  The theme of the consequences of people \\"crossing borders\\" or societal boundaries is something that appealed to me.<br /><br />While the basic story is very interesting, too much of the book is taken up with descriptions and unnecessary detail.  Part of the difficulty for me is that the author manipulates the reader by informing them in the first few pages about crime committed by very unlikely people and then proceeds with descriptions and repetitive analysis of motive and character before getting to the action.<br /><br />Wanting to find out what happened kept me reading the novel but I admit to doing a fair bit of skimming in the second half of the book.
B007N0REX6|5.0|This review has been way overdue on my part - finally at 34000 ft from London to LA I am able to put this out.<br /><br />If anyone remotely knows my musical tastes of recent, you know I have been repeatedly listening to heavy metal stuff for the past 24 months. Life happens I suppose and manifestations of newer tastes takes over the human condition- musical tastes too move onwards.<br /><br />I have picked up slash's solo albums since the snake pit and of course the velvet revolver fiasco. In my circles a heated debate always brews about the best guitarist etc. I am sure any avid rock listener has experienced this - clapton, van hailen, Stevie ray v, Steve via,  the edge, page and countless others lead the debates.<br /><br />This much I do recall at one point in one of these \\"rock\\" brothel debates someone uttered : slash is not in this group! He is a best sidelines at best! Of course I was appalled and got into a fiery fist of words on this!<br /><br />I am not looking for street crud either. While listening to all his albums since GNR I noticed something amazing with Slash. He really carries himself in that \\"guitarist mentality\\" mantra and thrives at it! The proof is in the rock n roll pudding!  I want anyone to nominate anyone else besides Sir Clapton  forward whom successfully had immersed himself with other Grade A artists and made amazing projects!!!<br /><br />Slash brings a certain style of humility and creativity all in one. I absolutely see his work as being a collective of many directions. Yet again I must emphasize the basic core from which he has grown: he gracefully has written \\"his\\" material and went to all the artists and not the other way around. That takes humility and a certain fineness to showcase when playing with Ozzy or Lemmy and the countless others!<br /><br />And the best part is when he plays \\"his\\" material alongside with these artists, you can still hear remnants of the guest artist in Slash's guitar playing! If thats not artistic growth then I don't know what is!<br /><br />But enough goofing off and let me congratulate him on his latest project with Sir Kennedy! In one word from my ears:  MOTHER-Effen remarkable!<br /><br />Sound - I am not sure what the boys are cooking behind the mixing board but this stuff on Mp3 and Cd just sounds in-freaking believable --KUDOS on sound<br /><br />Songs - each song written on this album with the solid collaboration with a \\"hand\\" picked band is just riveting and heartfelt<br /><br />Solo style - can one spell SOLO without Slash! He and the guys I guess on the album gave him the space to have that \\"slash edge\\" even in between verses and strange places - simply hair raising and ear popping guitar bliss<br /><br />Album art - I am like a kid again with this art! I want giant posters of it everywhere in my life - car walls iPhones and iPads -- best ever album cover I truly enjoyed immersing in!<br /><br />Creative freedom<br />This part is my favorite - so he goes all out on this album! It just sounds like he brought it all around without ever really looking back at anything he has done previously!! Total Slash+Guitar+band mates+full throttle creativity!<br /><br />This album has just been non stop pumping for me on all levels! Bravo chaps!!! Bravoooooooo!then I don't know what is!<br /><br />But enough goofing off and let me congratulate him on his latest project with Sir Kennedy!

B006TVQTHW|5.0|I purchased this through a local retailer because it was cheaper, but am taking the time to write a review because I simply love this case.<br /><br />While this case is certainly not as flashy as others flooding the market, the humble and unassuming (yet still sleek) design belies a high degree of intuitive functionality.<br /><br />I was a fan of the Antec 900 case, which provided excellent air cooling for my rig throughout college (my roommate hated the thing because it was so loud). I got this case for my new rig because it was cheap and figured it would serve me just as well as the 900 (which at the time cost $100).<br /><br />I was wrong. The Three Hundred Two is better in every way.<br /><br />In terms of size, this mid-size tower is roughly the same as the 900. It has a sleek, stealth-plane-like finish that's pleasing and not gaudy. It has a lot more room inside than I figured and easily supports a good number of drives--and the screw-less, clip design is an absolute godsend. It comfortably fit all my components. But what made it awesome is that the case was made to route cables through the right side of the case, freeing up precious space inside for other components and better airflow.<br /><br />Oh, and the stock fans on this puppy are really quiet. I never realized how noisy my 900 was until I first turned on my new PC. Even with a fan added in the front and a after-market heat sink for the CPU, I barely notice this thing (my roommate was upset that I got this case after we had moved apart lol).<br /><br />Everything about this case was made with user-ease in mind. I've already covered that the great cable management and clip design for drives, but another great feature this case has is that it's very easy to get into. The side panels swing open and go back on very smoothly (with my 900, I had to wrestle the panel back into place). The front panel also swings open without tools so you can add fans. It took longer to screw in my front fan than it did to open up the front panel. That's not all; the 900 had a perforated front grill to let air in for maximum cooling. Unfortunately, this allowed a crazy amount of dust in. With the Three Hundred Two, they've included a screen mesh to catch dust. You just need to swing the front panel open and pop out the screen to clean the dust! How's that for convenience!<br /><br />I love this case. It is more than I even wanted.<br /><br />That said, I do have a few caveats:<br />- There are only two front-panel USB 3.0 ports. I personally would like to have seen more.<br />- The case does not come with a converter cable for the front-panel USB 3.0 ports to connect to USB 2.0 on the motherboard (my motherboard unfortunately did not have anywhere to connect additional USB 3.0 ports, only 2.0). You have to order one from Antec, which they will ship over to you for free with proof of purchase (I emailed them a picture of my receipt). This process, however, might take you a while... (at least their customer service is friendly, if not prompt).<br />- Side panel fan is not as easy to put on as with the 900, the latter having clips.<br />- Documentation is... pathetic. While the case is rather self-explanatory, I figured out most its cool, user-friendly features on my own.<br />- Right side to route cables is a bit tight. For me, this space is extremely cramped because of how many cables I've got going through it. Luckily, I had L-shaped SATA cables, which reduced the cables bending, but be prepared for an extremely tight fit. If you don't have L-shape cables, you may have trouble closing the right panel...<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!<br /><br />P.S.

B005LAIGW8|1.0|This movie takes the crown of Worst Superhero Movie Ever Made from Catwoman.  I cannot understand what they were thinking when they allowed this \\"film\\" to be released into theaters.  It should have been shelved right next to the 1990's Fantastic Four movie, so Marvel could pretend it never happened.  It is so bad that the Sci-Fi Channel would have been embarrassed to release it as a made for TV movie.  It's not even worth a $1 rental from Redbox.<br /><br />I can find positive things to say about other lackluster superhero movies like Dare Devil, Electra, Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, Superman Returns, Green Lantern, X-men 3, Fantastic Four 1 & 2, and Ghost Rider 1.  There is something to like about all of those movies.  I really want to say something nice about this movie, but I can't.  I can't even say that it is one of those movies that is so bad it is good.  It's not even a train-wreck spectacle that you should see to believe.  It truly is that awful.<br /><br />This movie is an incredible disappointment and makes me ashamed of being a fan of the Ghost Rider comic books.  It has no redeeming moments.  You might like this film if you enjoy movies with ill-conceived plots, horrible acting, and mediocre CG.<br /><br />UPDATE: January 14, 2014 - I've spent some more time with this movie, having watched it 7-8 times, now.  I've got some advice to improve your viewing experience.<br /><br />Most importantly, I recommend that you watch this on DVD instead of Blu-ray.  The lower quality actually makes the CG look much better, whereas the hi-def exposes every flaw.  I cannot stress this enough.<br /><br />Secondly, The movie is slightly better when you sit down to watch it with super-low expectations.  While it is well deserving of the 1-star rating, it helps to just accept some of the poor decisions they made for this script; such as putting Ghost Rider in Europe and casting Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze.  I now see what they were trying to do with Ghost Rider's history, but they failed.  A lot of the changes still don't make sense with what you know and love about Ghost Rider, but if you can deal with it and enjoy the eye-candy, then you might actually be able to sit through the entire thing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so happy this is finally available! Works great so far, I can actually pin from my fire. plus, the links from the site to the pinned item's site actually works. yay!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally! The mobile site was buggy. I love the layout of this app.  Perfect for the pinterest addict like myself. Thanks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was better than expected. easy to learn games. great price. lots of fun. im really just writing this for free coins.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a fan of Stephen King when I was in high school.  Now, in my 40's he's still got it.  Great read, I highly recommend it.  I was drawn in early in the story and couldn't put it down.
B0086700CM|1.0|My 5 year old begged me to download this game, and since it was free, I happily obliged, not checking into the reviews much.  A few days later, I opened my bank account to find a $22 purchase and after digging around amazon, realized that either he or my 18 month old had purchased 250,000 coins in the app.  I turned off my one click settings and made sure the parental controls were on (still allowing access to apps, of course).  I was still able to \\"purchase\\" (I was able to click out and cancel at the last minute at least) coins despite precautions.  Since this app is one that is seemingly geared towards a younger crowd (with it's simplicity and Brave Run counterpart), I find this addition reprehensible. I was unaware that there was even an option to purchase something in game and I know that I am not alone in that.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I enjoyed this as much as part 1.  George R.R. Martin does an excellent job developing wonderful multi-dimensional characters and a very engaging plot full of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book thru Kindle Fire.  Though a lot of people were lifting their eyebrows because of the content of the book,<br />it makes me think that it's not the sex content but the story itself that will open your eyes.
B005IQZB14|4.0|What a wonderful book. It gave me courage when I needed it. Hiking might not be everyone's piece of cake but we can certainly take away a lot from this book. The frank and unapologetic style of writing really appealed to me.
B000002A3T|1.0|As Conan Doyle said, '... the supreme gift of an artist is knowing when to stop'. After listening to the album, one wonders if this wasn't just a bunch of hippies who came out of retirement to pad their portfolios. There is very little of vintage Floyd in the album; I also read someplace that Gilmour's (latest) wife was co-writer of many songs, which might explain the 'Britney Spears lilt' of some tracks!
B000OVLBHG|4.0|Just about as close as Hollywood can get to the book.  WIth the limitations of the presentation the story follows the flavor of RAH's classic book, but there was no way they could follow the tech described. Worth watching!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|This e-book is my latest OBSESSION! Every chance I get, I'm reading it and, at the same time, trying to savour every word. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. A must-read for any fan of Fantasy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't even put this game down, I am soooo addicted. I like being able to go back and try to work out a different route.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game. worth the time to try!!!! don't forget to rate and come back everyday. has a ton of games anyone could like c:
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this last book on kindle - it got me through a horrible layover in Toronto while traveling this summer. Thank you, Suzanne Collins!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The Hunger Games is an exciting, beautifully created movie that has a little something for everyone. Action, suspense, romance; you name it, it has it. Everyone will want to see this movie as soon as possible, and you will be the envy of your friends if you have it.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, the 16 year old heroine, volunteers to take her sister's place in the Games, and along with Peeta Mellark, they embark on a journey that no one will forget. With the help of Cinna, her stylist, Katniss wins the crowd over, and becomes a contender, but she will have to fight hard if she is to win.<br /><br />This film is beautiful, and while the camerawork is shaky, and at times distracting, the message is the same. Buy this film. It is fantastic, and is easy to become absorbed in!
034580404X|1.0|This book is sheer pornographhy. Sorry our nation has come to this kind of Best Seller! Amazon, you can do better. I am so sorry I spent money on this as the money was a gift.
B005HSL626|5.0|I loved it! very fun and awesome.  get this app I think it is great.  everyone I know loves this game.  chop fruit!  Bye!
0486479110|4.0|a fairly comprehensive sampling of illustrations from various books, however this is not a complete treasury. I don't think any of the books he illustrated are represented in their entirety here. a lot of nice color images for the price.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games I have come across for Android.  Totally easy to understand, and totally hard to put down. Luckily, each puzzle is short, so you'll always be close to a stopping point when you absolutely need to quit. The level progression is paced well, and no matter how good you get, there are always at least a few puzzles at each level which will confound you.
B000M341QE|1.0|With the exception of Walberg, the all-star cast preformed their roles beautifully. The issues at hand are the muddled script, the confusing casting and the unacceptable ending.<br /><br />There is little distinction between Matt Damon and Decaprio who sported the same crew-cut, body build, facial expressions and distracting accent. They looked so similar that I constantly had to remind myself who was who. Damon was a bad guy pretending to be a cop. Decaprio was a cop pretending to be a bad guy. At the rolling of the credit I was left wondering who Jack Nicolsen really was. The number of secret FBI informants in this movie is ridiculous and insulting. That fact only becomes evident at the end when heads explode unexpectedly and more bodies pile up, leaving the viewer feeling cheated. It was like watching a bad comedy. You may find yourself screaming \\"Are you kidding me?\\" at the TV screen.<br /><br />The girlfriend has no reason for being in this film, except to add the element of romance and sex. Her presence did nothing to propel this movie forward.<br /><br />This is a Scorsese film. Expect a lot of swearing, violence and blood and gore. I haven't removed any rating stars because of it.  The Departed is a mind-boggling, cluttered puzzle that fails to piece together at the end.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Permission: NFC<br />Does no one else wonder what they are using Near Field Communications for? Are they reading my credit card data? It would seem to not have a legitimate purpose. NFC is used to grab card data at Point Of Sale terminals. Please explain.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This entire series is engaging, informative and just plain fun. I would recommend it to anyone and Amazon made it easy to download the copy for my tablet and keep me going with it
B001TH16DS|5.0|I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. LOVE ALL THE STAR TREK MOVIES.MY ORDER WAS PROCESSED<br />QUICKLY AND SHIPPING WAS PROMPT. LOOK FORWARD TO ORDERING MORE OF THESE DVD'S;PERHAPS EVEN SOME MEMORIBILTYS. THE DVD'S ARE GOOD QUALITY.<br />OVERALL, I'M VERY SATISFIED. THANKS
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Her voice is really wrecked here. I guess that's what hard living does to a person. She really should have treasured and cultivated her talent instead of destroying it with drugs. Such a shame, at her peak she really was unparallelled. I won't be listening to this again any time soon.
B000002513|5.0|This is simply is one of the greatest albums ever produced.  Every song is a story telling musical gem.  If he could only write and produce now as well as he did for the first 15 years of his career.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It was the biggest load of crap I have ever read.  What a marketing sensation.  So sad that people find this entertaining
B0089J270U|5.0|If you are fan of glorious color musicals with great stories, then this is the Blu Ray DVD for you. Those color musicals of the 50's are about as vibrant color as you can get and the blu ray aspect adds to the beauty.  This DVD transfer makes you realize how beautiful your color set and blu ray player can perform. It has a who's who of musical stars of the time (1954) and an added bonus and suprisingly very adapt singing Marilyn Monroe.  Dan Dailey is his usual dancing, singing, and gregarious self.  The singing, dancing, and over the top Donald O'Connor is very believable as his son.  Ethel Merman is her usual wonderful song belting self and Mitzi Gaynor is very believable as her daughter.  I mean if Dan Dailey and Ethel Merman had kids, they would have been Donald O'Conner and Mitzi Gaynor.  Not that familiar with Johnny Ray.  He was probably the weakest of the characters, but fit in to make it a very believable show business family.  Entertaining and full of songs you will recognize.  Theres No Business Like Show Business is to Ethel Merman as Thanks for the Memories is to Bob Hope.  Get this DVD, put it in the player, and sit back and enjoy the musical ride.
B0026MOVO6|5.0|Killer urban record, with It's not right but it's ok the best song on album. Oh yes comes in second with sexy, sensual singing. I learned from the best, lovely song. This album stands up for today's audience. Her voice is degraded some, but the songs fit her voice, so it is perfect.
0811869261|5.0|Everyone in my family loves this book.  It's huge, colorful, funny, detailed, has thick, durable pages, and it's interesting.  The 6 month old loves to look at it, and the 3 year old loves to talk about the pictures and move around all the little mask stickers.  We like it so much we're going to get a few to get for emergency gifts for kid's parties.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Adorable baby wipes dispener suitable for any setting & easily accessible to handle your baby's needs. I love it and I would recommend it to any new or seasoned mom! It arrived on schedule and in perfect condition. I highly recommend this vendor!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is full of variety. never boring and if you're competitive this is what you want...very addictive.<br />Also great for all ages.
B000002VMD|5.0|The rest of this cd is not worth it. I love how Jesus loves me is done with added lyrics. I have nothing, run to you is just superb singing. She hits it out of the ballpark with just six songs. What a talent.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I keep this in my car in case of emergencies, so I haven't gotten to use it much. As such, I am simply reviewing the item itself and its build. It seems very sturdy and the amount of tools included on it is great. They all seem very useful and I could imagine many scenarios where I might need to use any of them. (I have used the scissors a few times to cut things, actually.) The only thing that annoys me is that the case it comes with has a flap which makes it a real pain to replace the tool. You have to usually hold it back while you slide it in. Not necessarily worth taking a whole star away, but there you go. Otherwise, it seems like a very worthwhile investment.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This is a great product. It works perfectly and is air tight. Only negative is you have to press screen harder than without cover and plastic screen gets scratched. Overall happy since water is normally the demise of my daughters phones.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest on the mobile web is so slow, buggy, and a battery hog. This app performs beautifully on my rezound and my nook color. I will now be even more glued to my devices, if that's even possible! Thanks Pinterest! This app was very much needed for functionality.
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney puts her heart and soul into this. Her voice isn't as good as on the Bodyguard, but the passion in her singing makes up for it. This will lift your spirits up.
030758836X|4.0|There's a reason that this is the number 1 best seller in the country (as of August 16, 2012). Because it's good!<br /><br />If you feel that you must read reviews that go beyond a summary of the plot, stick to those written by professional critics who have an idea what they're talking about.

B003WE9TU8|5.0|It isn't that often that a book or film keeps me thinking about it afterwards but World War Z did just this.  I'm not normally into the zombie genre but this book is so much more than just about the living dead.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the reanimated corpses has a scientific explanation, which made the story all the more credible.  The descriptions of the undead are vivid, but do not appear enough to spoil the story.  What is more important is the human reaction, and this is what I found most interesting.<br /><br />The novel is told retrospectively via a series of anecdotes told by a series of global survivors.  This is a decade after the war, which already tells us that humanity manages to find a way to survive.  I liked the global element and although a lot of the action does take place in America (the author is American, so you can understand that) you get the feeling of this being a global catastrophe and what is really fascinating is Brook's prediction of how the world would behave in this situation.<br /><br />This is a gripping and terrifying story and you will be looking around your kitchen afterwards to see if you can fashion a weapon to save you from the zombie hordes!  Can't wait to see what the film will be like

034580404X|4.0|The books were very interesting indeed however the ending was a bit short. It seemed as though the author felt like they needed to hurry up and finish which lacked originality. I would recommend the books to readers but realize they are very racy and NOT for young eyes!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I cannot afford cable with all the premium movie channels (over $100/month!). I watched the first 3 seasons of Sons of Anarchy on Netflix, but they didn't provide an avenue to watch any more seasons. Thought I was going to have to wait for the completed series and buy the DVD or wait for another avenue to open for me. A friend turned me on to Amazon Prime (first month free to try, then $79/year). I can finally watch my SOA show without commercials from Amazon, as well as other shows I have come to love that are normally only available on cable networks. Strangely, I can subscribe to Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu... all cheaper than a cable/Direct TV subscription monthly, and not miss any of my favorite shows! Go figure!<br />  Thanks Amazon!<br />  semperfimom
0142410705|5.0|Having loved TFIOS and Looking for Alaska, and liked Paper Towns, I don't know why I wasn't looking forward to this book. The concept (and the original cover) just seem nearly as compelling as the other three. In the end, I'm so glad I did read it! It was my favorite yet. I love Hassan, and Lindsay Lee Wells, who is refreshing after manic pixie dream- girls like Alaska and Margo. Read it! You won't regret it.

1451627297|5.0|I have read almost all of Mr King's novels and novellas, also  as his other self, Mr. Bachman. My favorite had always been, The Shining, but, I have now changed that favorite to,11/22/63. This IS his best book to date.<br /><br />The characters are real, you get pulled into the story. I could not put this book down. It may be because of the subject and living thru that horrible day brings back memories of where I was and what I was doing. But, it more than that, imagine the chance to fix what is going to happen in the future by going back in time. Would you, knowing what was to happen?<br /><br />I loved this book and plan to reread it. It was lengthy,800 pus pages, but like some other novels it did not repeat it's self. Thank God!! The story plot is excellent, the characters engaging, the ending Not what you think is going to happen, And I'm not telling!!<br /><br />If you think that you have read the Best Stephan King, rethink it. If you haven't read, 11/22/63, pick it up and read it. You will not be disappointed.

030745455X|4.0|While not as in depth and thought out as the first novel in the series, The Girl who Played with Fire offers an intriguing glimpse into the mysterious history that has led Lisbeth to be the kind of woman she is. It follows the same format as the first book as a plot driven by a journalists discovery and pursuit, which leads to the uncovering of dangerous information. If you enjoyed the first novel in the series, you will surely enjoy this book as well.

B0058DRUV6|4.0|As many reviewers have said, this is a seminal book about corporate organizations. With the detailed analysis it takes away most of the judgemental aspects of determining compnay \\"greatness\\".  It really hammers home - good people doing the right things for a clearly defined product / service offering.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see how some companies - Particulary Fannie Mae have faired post 2008.  Also would be intersting to see the analysis applied to Apple, especially as post -Jobs era data builds.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a Rush fan for almost my entire life(41 years old,started listening around 10). Over the years, Rush has been at the front of their craft of making incredible music. In the past few years after the hiatus of the band from 1997 to 2002 due to tragedy in Peart's life, the band seemed to struggle to find the ground of which could give them the second or third wind thats pushing them into the heights that they are striving for in a career field wrought with strung out musicians and those who can't face the inevitable fact they are finished as a band. Rush has done the unthinkable, the unbelievable. They have found that ground, that place of which to make unbelievers into believers of their music. The idea of returning to their concept album roots has paid off. Every moment of Clockwork Angels is overlaid with some of the best and tightest composition this side of the progressive music genre. I literally feel like I am being taken into another realm, another world of fantasy that they did with their earlier albums. Its exciting to hear and experience this, coming from a band almost 40 years old!!!!Take a seat in the classroom, novice musicians, the professors are teaching you how to make exceptional music.

034580404X|5.0|These are absolutely the BEST books I have ever read. I have never felt so in touch with the characters and the emotions that they felt. It makes you feel almost like you are the characters. I would recommend these books to anyone and everyone. I have been lost in them for a month now and that's only because I don't want them to end so I am taking my time. I can't wait for the author to write another book, absolutely amazing and worth every penny!

0345803485|1.0|I heard a lot of different things about this book, so I had to read it for myself to form my own opinion. Being completely honest I understand the allure of the book, but it is definitely not my type of story. This reads like fanfiction and what I mean by this is that it lacks depth and the writing is a bit poor. I thought the book was quite boring because nothing was really going on. I mean the book is quite long but it was based on events that happened in like 3 or 4 weeks, and basically nothing really happened. All I saw happening was constant sex between both characters and by the time I was halfway through I was already bored with it. I don't even feel the sex scenes were that exciting either. The first few were interesting but then I started to realize that it was the same sex scene over and over with different props, no changes in the language...nothing new to look forward to either.<br />I also have to say that I can't believe they are in love with each other, they barely know each other and Christian is a egocentric jerk. I honestly don't see how so many women would like a man like him, when will modern women understand that jealousy and possessiveness aren't healthy factors in a relationship. The need Christian has to control is pathological and I frankly think Ana is in dire need of psychiatric help because a women shouldn't be so excited about entering an emotionally abusive relationship (I don't even think the S&M Christian practices is the real issue, I think that it's the way he treats her emotions and feelings). I just feel like this is the type of book that may be misinterpreted because the author makes it sound like a passionate idealized story. I think many young women with low self-esteem are more likely to enter emotionally abusive relationships and this book in a way may make some believe that this type of love is ideal...a frantic, passionate, painful love.<br />You can tell that this book started out as twilight fanfiction...the story line is quite similar if you take away or add the supernatural aspects. In Fifty Shades Christian's dark tendencies represent the fact that Edward is a dangerous vampire and of course Ana can't stay away from all of this.<br />I'd like to add one more thing that completely annoyed me while reading this book. I don't understand why Ana needed a subconscious and inner goddess participating in every though all the time. It kind of felt like she had multiple personality disorder while reading and also quite intrusive and annoying. It's like even though those two were part of Ana, I still felt like I could never reach her because these two kept intruding during those parts. I think as a writer you still could try to find another way to communicate the ambivalent emotions Ana was feeling for Christian without adding so many characters.<br />I don't really recommend this book...I highly doubt you will learn something from this book or find something of value in it. It's good to pass the time....until about halfway through...then it starts getting boring, but that's just my opinion.quite similar if you take away or add the supernatural aspects.

I had heard that this book was going to be great and there were so many reviews saying it was the best. Now after reading it I can't understand what all the hoopla was about. This was absolutely the worst book I have ever read. It was a challenge finishing it but since I HATE to waste money Isuffered through readingit to get to the end. How many times can someone flush, blush, roll their eyes those things happen so often I was wondering are those the only adjectives in the dictionary. Please take my advice DON\\"T waste your money. Go get a burger and fries instead..lol... And for the writer-please stick to your day job cause writing isn't your thing.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I will admit that I am quite late to the Community party, I was only aware of the show a couple of months ago due to the fact that Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) is one of the starring actors. I am a big fan of Donald Glover's music and stand-ups, however as an actor I was a little bit skepticle. I came across the show on-demand not too long ago and I HAVE BEEN HOOKED EVER SINCE. This show is incredible from just about every aspect, the writing is top notch, the humor (while very silly) is neither corny or tries too hard, just about all the characters from the start are loveable, and the setting is very relatable to people around the ages of 18-27 as well as those who attend a community college. Season 1 is a great start, while the first couple of episodes don't exactly capture the characters true personalities just yet, the premise and the interactions between the characters are just laugh out loud all the way through. I guess the shows main theme is DIVERSITY, and how people of different cultures can come together, learn from one another, and befriend one another without succumbing to typical stereotypes. I love how the show incorporates racial satire, silly and sarcastic humor, and very outlandish situations to create such a genuine, fun show. While primarily a comedy show, there are also subtle touching moments that really contain deep moral values to them that it's hard not to love.<br /><br />The DVD itself was great. 4 discs with a great amount of episodes (25 to be exact) with each and every episode accomodated with commentaries. Other extras include various outtakes of essentially every episode which are truly hilarious, some featurettes, alternate and deleted scenes, as well as mini-episodes. I am very impressed with how many extras they jampacked into this DVD. It is great to get a real taste of the creation and process of the show, and lucky for us, there many extras thatare at the consumers disposal. As far as modern television, I would rank this as my new #1 favorite show easily eclipsing The Big Bang Theory. I'm actually not really used to sitcoms that don't use laugh tracks, which can sometimes escalate humor, but also make it generic and annoying when its not a real audience. Community is just one of those shows that don't come around very often that I can personally find enjoyable from every single episode. I am looking forward to watching and purchasing the other seasons and future seasons (hopefully it will not be cancelled due to low ratings) Pick it UP!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. Alison Brie & Gillian Jacobs are just all kinds of fine ;) hahay new #1 favorite show easily eclipsing The Big Bang Theory.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Probably one of the most overhyped, overrated books I've read in a long time. Preordered after reading the glowing reviews in Entertainment Weekly.  Potential for a great story, but ultimately falls completely flat.  The characters were unlikeable and the ending was horrible. I actually went back to the issue of EW to make sure I had ordered the right book! Save your money.

B008ER9QLK|1.0|I'm surprised that this production, which has gotten so many bad reviews from critics, is rating so well on Amazon. To me it was an overly traditional production void of any personality.  It was empty, both figuratively of emotion and drama and literally with the stage set.  I don't understand how it was marketed as spectacular and revolutionary when it was really boring and despite the gigantic Machine, quite a small production with not much going on.<br /><br />The singing is top notch but if you're not going to enjoy the visuals you might as well get yourself any other Ring Cycle.  For now I recommend [[ASIN:B00424NWIW Wagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen [Blu-ray]]], with a similar projections approach but order of magnitudes better.  If you're looking for the best of the best, get [[ASIN:B008VNIA32 Der Ring Des Nibelungen [Blu-ray]]], easily the best Ring Cycle (at least until the L.A. Ring Cycle is filmed), or the Centennial Production if you can find it
0345803485|1.0|The first book of this trilogy was a lot of fun...very sexy. One book would have done it...by book three I was reaching boredom orgasm.  It was a great fantasy..but really???... I guess the author wanted to make three million dollars from three books instead of one million from one...sounds like her Dom.
0307951529|4.0|This is a great book for those who are looking to create what is termed a lifestyle business. As others have said, it is incredibly inspiring and gives a solid overview of new models of creating a business at home.<br /><br />As others said, it was extremely broad and for some this was a downfall. I believe that this is beneficial to those who are confused about business direction and want a credible resource.<br /><br />I did have a few issues with it:<br />- most of the businesses created are not startups. They are lifestyle/online businesses.<br />- A lot of businesses are from the same community, despite efforts to source examples from elsewhere.<br />- I didn't like the reference to a blogger whose disingenuous actions have been exposed. I feel that this could lead people down the wrong path<br />- Not enough attention was paid to the difficulties of running an online business, or any business. The information given wouldn't apply to all businesses.<br />- Online consulting isn't as simple as picking a topic and whacking up a page. Not everyone is cut out to be a consultant or coach - they can actually cause their clients damage.<br /><br />It is one of the better books out there. I'd recommend it to a lot of people who want to know the basics of setting up an online coaching practice or infoproduct business. You will learn a lot and get inspiration. You just have to go into it with an open mind and question everything.
1476712042|3.0|For a long while, I didn't have such mixed feelings about a book. I simply loved some parts of the story, while I found other parts totally sickening.<br /><br />The first thoughts I had when I started the book were that it would be a pretty good scenario for a romantic comedy. The plot is kind of classic: she - a (pretty) good girl, he - the bad boy, they become friends, they deny their feelings and in the end their relationship develops into an explosive love story. Nothing special, right? Still, after the first pages I was totally subdued. The story is very well written, from the point of view of the protagonist, a 19 years old woman which runs from her past, retreating with her best friend in a college campus in another corner of the country. I liked the fact that the author managed to display perfectly the specific feelings of that age, the hesitation moments mixed with the impulsive decisions, the fear and the emotions of a.. disastrous love, the runaway from the past and the hopes for the future, the irresistible attraction and the effort to resist to a relation that makes the sparks fly at every step. Unfortunately, at a certain point, the heroine's hesitations and her stubbornness to ignore what's obvious become someway annoying. I'm not talking only about the way she denies her own feelings, but about the fact that she refuses to see Travis's, juggling between the so-called friendship with him and the flirty relation with another colleague, indifferent to the way she hurts both of them. Altogether, that's just an excessive dalliance of the things that will eventually happen. I think this part was extended so much that it becomes nerve-racking.<br /><br />Starting with the second half of the book, the story begins to change. Abby and Travis are finally a couple and I was really curious about the way the author filled the other part of the novel. I actually have the sensation that I read two books in one. The story moves in a new category, with more action,more suspense and a racing style. Abby and Travis are now confronting her past and the adventures they live are beginning to put their lives and futures in danger. The bad thing is that the characters are so different that you have the feeling that they're other persons. If in the first half of the novel I was thinking that all girls should have their own Travis - smart, strong, funny, protective and independent in the same time, in the next part of the book I was totally disgusted by the way the love story developed. Travis becomes the sick kind of lover: obsessed, violent to anybody that dares to look at Abby, jealous, possessive and desperate. After every new scene comes a round of embarrassing excuses, gooey declarations and such excessively sweet remarks that you feel sick. And of course, after every fight, Abby forgives Travis and they love each other again peacefully for a few days. Or a few hours. Towards the ending, we get more and more slipslops: tattoos with the name of the partner, an unplanned wedding in Vegas, and remarks about a future child. At 19 years! In the first year of college!.. From my point of view, the second part of the book is totally wrong. I understand that we still like the stories ending in \\"they lived happily ever after\\" , I understand that their love had to be different by their friendship, I understand that everything had to be more intense, more romantic and sweeter. But not like this! Not by promoting a sick kind of love, an obsessive relation, a humble or even an admiring attitude in front of the violence for everybody else, an almost complete control of the other person and a broken freedom.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Unlike other novels, in Beautiful Disaster you don't get the feeling that everything happens on fast forward. The book offers a very realistic vision of the characters' life. Although the main story is represented by the relations between them, the casual aspects of life are not forgotten. There are a lot of fragments that show the usual actions like classes, studying, clubbing or daily habits starting from breakfast to dinner, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The characters evolution in the second part of the book. I already written about it, so I don't need to insist. I think it's sad that on most of the sites, the novel appears under the Young Adult genre (although I heard that the author denies this, saying that I's actually romance or something like that). Anyway, this means that it will be read by a lot of teenagers. From which, at least a part of them are pretty easy influenced. Especially considering that Travis' portrait is perfect until a certain moment. So some of those teenagers might begin seeing some things in the wrong way they were shown in the novel. They might think it's flattering that the boy they like or have a relation with at some point acts like Travis. To grab them out of an innocent conversation with another boy, to shatter everything around in the moments when he's annoyed, to get drunk when he suffers, to use emotional blackmail when an argument appears, to refuse a break-up, to stalk them and then to swear immortal love and to excuse himself saying that everything he does is because of love.<br />flag

B000005RY7|4.0|I have always dreamt of possessing this unique compilation and my dreams have just come true. In brief, it is exceptional for a few reasons. First, it is the only long play by KISS missing its original logo on the front cover. The logo that contained \\"famous lightning bolts\\" was forbidden in Germany when \\"KILLERS\\" was issued.<br />Second, the music is quite smashing. Most of the songs are available on other KISS LPs \\"Love Gun\\", \\"Destroyer\\", \\"Dynasty\\". These well-known tracks, great hits (\\"I was made for loving you\\", \\"Love gun\\",\\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"Shout it out loud\\", \\"Rock and roll all nite\\") are a value added to this final production. Undoubtedly, the four songs which cannot be reached anywhere but on \\"KILLERS\\" are outstanding and absorbing too. The LP is worth buying just for these four tracks unavailable on other KISS records. In my opinion the best of these four are \\"I'm a legend tonight\\" and \\"Partners in crime\\". Both are written by Paul Stanley and A.Mitchell. But the other exceptional two \\"Nowhere to run\\" and \\"Down on your knees\\" are fairly good. One will not be disappointed with it.<br />To sum up, \\"KILLERS\\" is a must for every KISS fan. It may be also recommended to everyone who is fond of classic hard rock music.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the other two books in the series much better. This third book was very hard to read and not has interesting. There were a  Lot of twist that kept your interest but I didn't like the story line.
0743496736|4.0|This book was amazing. Picoult is such a remarkable, lyrical and evocative writer. I really thought she was true to how the pain and trauma of a high school shooting affect the community. I also really liked how we saw the tragedy through multiple perspectives. It really was jarring how Peter's parents felt just as lost, confused and heartbroken as the parents of the victims. Of course, for Lacey and Lewis, they were also plagued with self-doubt in their parenting abilities and blamed themselves for what Peter did.<br /><br />I found it to be an interesting change that Peter did not kill himself at the end of the shooting spree, and I liked how we got to see what was going on in his head. Sometimes, I found myself sympathizing with him, but at others, I found him to be remorseless and a repulsive human being. At the heart of the matter, I do think Peter was a very tortured individual who was driven to do what he did out of desperation and a desire to make the bullying stop. Obviously, I don't condone his actions, but it's shocking how much psychological and physical abuse he went through.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about Josie was that she seemed to give Peter mixed messages. At times, she treated him with such distaste and at others, she's kissing him in elevators. The relationship between them was so complex and I really liked how both the characters were written. There were a lot of moments when we saw Josie through Peter's eyes (to let the reader know how much Peter cared about her), and there were a few where we saw Peter through Josie's eyes (to let the reader see how separated in status they were). It was an interesting writing style to adopt where we saw Peter differently by everyone.<br /><br />The ending was incredible. This book forces you to see both sides of the story and really makes you think. Highly recommended.

Get this cookbook, I have blown some minds with these recipes! My favorite so far has got to be either the peanut butter cupcakes or the tiramisu cupcakes with either the cream cheese or chocolate mousse being my favorite topping so far. I have tried only 8 different cupcakes so far but I will continue to try more, all have been excellent. Don't tell anyone there is tofu in the mousse until after they have ate the cupcake, then after gulping it down tell them and they will be shocked and will be forced to admit to themselves and others they enjoy tofu.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I first read Gone Girl, and thought surely this cant b topped and yet Dark Places caught me completly off gaurd and crazy about this author.  Flynn writes so brilliantly, the characters are so dark yet so real, and every ghastly page leaves u begging for more!  This book is not for the faint at heart, so readers beware, Flynn's novels will take you to your deep, &#34;dark places&#34; and leave you wanting more.  Flynn's vocabulary and writing style creates a brilliantly smart novel.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyed The Night Circus but it didn't have the impact I expected having reading other reviews. The book is certainly very imaginative and the rich imagery of the circus descriptions are outstanding.<br /><br />I felt immersed in the story but somehow didn't really connect with, or feel any empathy for, the characters. I didn't become totally engaged in the romantic elements either.<br /><br />That said, I recommend the book and it's worth four stars for the writing alone.

0393327655|4.0|In my opinion, the book was written well overall.  I marked it down because I feel the author was not clear in a particular chapter of the book, where it appears he may even support torture, which I am against.  I also cannot make any kind of judgement on the final chapter where Harris writes about subject matter which I have not studied myself.<br /><br />I am rewriting my review because my previous review opened with an attack on the one star reviews and contained personal issues.  I am not deleting the previous review, however, because this could be seen as dishonest.  The original is below.<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />The criticisms in the one star reviews were quite appalling.  I think it is obvious that those who think that Sam Harris is being intolerant toward religion have never had to grow up in a preacher's household.  They have never heard the nice old lady say that the Native Americans deserved to die because they were pagans.  They have not been pulled out of public school and placed in a second rate private church school because their parents didn't want them to learn about the theory of evolution or sex education.  They have never had to grow up finding Satan under every rock.  The fact of the matter is that Sam Harris is correct that hidden within every religious person lurks a dogmatic danger that could strike at any time and the only thing holding it back is our secular laws.  Look, I have friends who are Christians; I don't hate Christians, I disagree with their religious views.<br /><br />The one thing that kept me from giving the book a 5 star review was the confusion in one chapter where it seems as if Sam Harris supports torture.  At the end of this chapter I was not sure if he was for it or against it, and I hope that he is against it.  I also cannot make any kind of judgement on the final chapter where he writes about things I have not studied myself.<br /><br />While I may have my slight disagreements on a few details of the book, the majority is solid work of a person who knows what he is talking about.etails of the book, the majority is solid work of a person who knows what he is talking about.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book is absolutly best of all I have read about this problem before. It is not one more self-motivation text, it allows you to really understand the problem and its reasons, decide what is really matter in your case and use methods that are really effective for you.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|I swear I don't know what sci-fi movie makers would have done without Phillip K. Dick's writings to base films on.  By my count this is the 10th major movie release based on Dick's books/short stories.  The first was brilliant(Blade Runner) and the rest fall somewhere on lower levels of accomplishment.  The Adjustment Bureau is one of the better adaptations.  The acting and production are excellent and the pacing is about right.  It is a fun ride and worth owning if you're a serious sci-fi and/or Phillip K. Dick aficionado.  True, at its core it is a love story with a sci-fi frame, but it never falls into anything too sappy or sweet.  Throughout, the film stays on course.
B005LAII94|5.0|First off, i loved this ,and i plan on buy it when it comes out. I don't know why there was bad review from other people, but i thought this movie is bad ass, and you buy it.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|The short story \\"Steel\\" upon which this film is based is done a great disservice by this film adaptation.  The Twilight Zone episode starring the great Lee Marvin was much more serious and dark in tone.  The B&W presentation also enhanced this story by making that future world look even more bleak.  While I am a Hugh Jackman fan, I did not care much for his effort in this weak movie.  Hugh is not the type of actor that can carry a film on his own.  He needs a decent script and direction.  This movie has neither.  This film is a fluff piece of CGI that is worth a single viewing and then forgotten.  It's not a waste of your life, but its not an enhancement of much value either.
0375842209|5.0|My blog: [...] :)<br /><br />First of all, I wanted to say The Book Thief is my favorite book of all and I'm sure it will be my favorite forever. I've never read a book that the characters seem so real, alive and as if they were my friends.<br /><br />This book is narrated by the Death and when I got knowing about it I thought that was really creative and the author managed to show perfectly the feelings of the Death. The Death isn't mean, it just has to do its task and it doesn't really like doing it, mainly in the  biggest wars in the world. The book beggins with Liesel Memingers and her brother in a train going to their new home. Their mother can't feed them anymore so her last chance is giving them to a new family, the Hubermanns. There she met Rosa Hubermann and Hans Hubermann, her new parents. The Hubermanns...*sigh* how cute and warm they are, the perfect german family Liesel could wish. With Hans, Liesel could learn how to read and after learning with her new dad, she trained and trained till she fall in love with those big,small,thin or thick mount of papers. She loved them so much but so much that she hadn't another way but stealing them to feed all that hunger for books.<br /><br />I could understand perfectly that love for books of Liesel and I'm sure you will understand it perfectly like me. In the moments of theft I got so excited because I also felt like stealing all the books that in a way or other caught my attention. And they caught the attention of Liesel like they do with me. She looked at a book and just felt like reading it, but how if she didn't have money to buy all the books she wanted, how if she even couldn't read all them, but only the fact of having all them was enough to make her happy, so why not steal all them?<br /><br />Markus has the best narrative I have seen in my life, I swear. As being my favorite book I have no cons of it. I couldn't stop reading the book because whenever I opened it I was brought to Germany and I could feel all chaos that the characters felt, the sadness of Death for having to carry all those murderes and I could find new friends. All characters were like my friends and that's the point of he book. Markus wanted we to feel so close to all these characters and I have to congratulate him for that and also thank him for writing such a fantastic book.<br /><br />This book is without no doubt sad but at the same time beautiful and real. It is just what really happened back then and we can't change it, unfortunately, but History is like that, some things must happen to change the mind of others and the History continues and the man goes on with it. I confess that the book changed me and changed in a good way. Unfortunately this book didn't help people in the past 'cause it wasn't written in the WWII, but I'm sure that if it was, many people would stop to see what they are doing and they would recognize they were out of the control and with stupid and nonsense reasons to make wars.<br /><br />The Book Thief is a book that must be read for those who like to know the truth and read a story that will conquer the reader. Will it make you sad and cry like a crybaby? Yes, it will but it will also show you that the past was cruel and that it depends on a people to make it better and that people needs to be conscious.<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone, but I know there are people who don't like crying but I think you must stop with that because only because a book is sad doesn't mean it is bad. Good readings need sometimes sad and bad moments, otherwise it won't be a real book  .t, the sadness of Death for having to carry all those murderes and I could find new friends.

B000O75F7C|3.0|After being highly dissapointed with my late introduction to the band upon my fist listens to \\"Deadwing\\" in '07, I was hesitant to go any further.  Frankly, I was bored by it.  Since then, I've come around substantially on this group, especially upon hearing \\"In Absentia\\".  That is by far the best I've heard from PT.  Next, I tried \\"Signify\\" which I thought had one great track, but again left me feeling somewhat restless.  After my purchase of \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\", I think I am starting to finally get this group a little more.  Track one on this disc is truly a great one, and track three has some nice sections within its 18 minutes, but on the whole the album is very contemplative and drifty.  I liked it because I wasn't expecting it to blow my doors off like \\"In Absentia\\".  As you may know, expectations can kill an open mind.  Unfortunately, I'm still looking for another disc like it in the PT discography.  Even so, their softer tunes are enjoyable for different reasons.  I would now say that PT is a great band to listen to late at night when the party is passed its peak, with the exception of the aforementioned \\"In Absentia\\".  If you are in a thoughtful mood, this album is perfect.  However, If you're lookin' to rock hard in a prog way track after track, this won't scratch your itch.  Just one old prog fan's opinion for whatever it's worth.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great way to pass the time.  My kids love unlocking the new games and challenging themselves to pass each one.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I thought this prequel was about as good as they get.  I'm not sure I've ever seen one that was better than the original film.  For example, I thought the Star Wars prequels, now known as Episodes 1 - 3, were watchable but weak.  That was not true with his film.  Admittedly, this film is not as strong as JC's Thing, but its damn good.  If you loved JC's Thing, you've got to have this for the collection to complete the story.  In my opinion, the value is there.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|The show is amazing and deserves five stars.<br /><br />The box set design is terrible; the CDs are squeezed inside the pages of the book and hence are difficult to remove, and can quite easily be damaged due to this.<br /><br />If I were to buy this again I'd consider buying each season separately so I had it in a decent case.
B007549W62|3.0|This is a brutal, cold and stark movie depicting the immediate aftermath of the nuclear apocalypse.  I enjoyed the fact that the residents of the apartment building hiding out in the basement have no idea what is going on or why armageddon has arrived.  That is how most of us would really experience such an event.  The acting was solid throughout and production values were fine, but the movie lacks any kind of soul that the viewer can tap into for the ride, albeit an uncomfortable one.  Not that they are comparable films, but \\"Testament\\" has a very down-beat nuclear war theme, but the heart of the film was obvious and consistent.  This film lacks any real depth to enable the story and characters to be anchored to something the viewer cares about.  When you're done watching, you feel relieved that the ugliness these characters have shown each other over two hours is finished.  While I can say that I thought the movie was an okay one-time watch, I would not buy it for the collection.  It is not a film for multiple viewings, in my humble opinion.  Once was okay, but enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|okay, so unlike a lot of other games....this one is actually entertaining and a little addictive. I like it because you can play one level, put it away and come right back to it. I also like it because it does offer a little challenge. I dint have much time to waste..but if I want to just waste away..I play this. :)
B006LSZECO|3.0|Spoiler Alert!<br />I couldn't connect with the main character, Amy - or to say, not any of her characters. I couldn't sympathize with her situation as the totally over the top, not realistic Best-of-the-best wife character. She was too goodie-goodie and therefor more annoying than relateable.  Then she is super wacko but brilliant crazy Amy, who thinks of EVERY DETAIL needed to frame her husband, but then manages to get swindled by two hobo nobodies, so that didn't make any sense. After that, ever twist and turn of the book, just felt like another twist I needed to get through until the book ended. I finished it, but I wouldn't call it a sensational page turner.

The beginning was a little slow, as most books are, but as it progressed (pretty much chronologically) I was mesmerized by the people and their stories.<br /><br />The author does a great job interweaving all the stories together to create a coherent account of North Korea's recent cultural history.  This book makes me anxious to find more information on the current situation and figure out what can be done to help.

1451648537|4.0|Until I got my iPad for Christmas, the only Apple product I had ever owned was an iPod that ended up collecting dust on my dresser. A cool product, but since I couldn't work out with it, I never much used it.<br /><br />My iPad, however, is another story. For me, it is a tool I use daily. I take notes, read books, newspapers, and other online content, review and mark-up legal documents for work, and listen to music, play games, and update online social media. I've used it to make videos of events, take high quality pictures, and keep my kiddos quiet in church (and in the early hours on Saturday morning when I pretend I will be able to sleep in). It is everything my laptop is, except, perhaps, a word processor.<br /><br />This isn't supposed to be a paean to my iPad, but a review of Walter Isaacson`s biography of Steve Jobs. The more I used my iPad, the more I began to wonder at its history.  As a lifelong PC user, I have always found Mac users  unnervingly cult-like, professing a loyalty and adherence to their Apple products with almost religious like fervor. (It's not unheard of for Mac users to be accused of having a `superiority complex,' either).  With an Apple product in hand, I found myself curious about my own proclivities, as well as the history of the tool. Why was it Apple could inspire such devotion, to a mere consumer product, to boot?<br /><br />I picked up the Steve Jobs biography hoping to find out, or at least shed a little light on it.<br /><br />____________<br /><br />I suppose there are a lot of ways to look at Steve Jobs. However you view him, though, it's hard to dispute his success in technology, design, and animation. Not quite an inventor or engineer, Jobs thought himself more an artist, and perhaps he was.  He had an attention to detail and a vision of minimalism that allowed him to build great products that changed how we compute, listen to music, and make purchases, to say nothing of his contributions to the digital animation industry with Pixar.<br /><br />Despite his genius, Jobs was not easy to get along with. His critiques of others work was usually unfiltered, and he would either deride it or praise it. It was either absolute rubbish (though he would usually describe it with a four letter word) or pure genius. There was no in-between. (At least one person I know has on several occasions referred to Jobs as a member of the equus africanus asinus genus, and not favorably).<br /><br />Among other things, I also learned that:<br />--Jobs was adopted, but he never would meet his real parents, even after his sister found them.<br />--He was, clearly, a child of the '60s, and even went so far to suggest that doing LSD was a good idea.<br />--He spent seven months in India looking for \\"enlightenment.\\"<br />--While he never graduated from college, it was there that he gained his appreciation for the connection between the liberal sciences and technology in a calligraphy class.<br />--Jobs likes to cuss.<br />--While working for him could be stressful, I think it would also be rewarding. If I could cut it.<br /><br />His deficiencies-as a father, as a person-don't diminish his single-minded focus to making things that were great. With each new product release, he would announce that \\"this is the greatest product we've ever made\\" and pull off the cover of something new, whether it was the Mac or the iPhone or the iPad.  We live in a world that is deeply influenced by his contributions to technology, and while time alone will show how lasting those contributions are, and how long Apple can succeed without Jobs, it would be hard to disagree that few people have had as an immediate impact as Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Isaacson's biography is fascinating, covering warts and moles along with his contributions and genius. With direct access to Jobs, his associates, rivals, and family, it is an incomparable work that will be the defining biography for decades to come.<br /><br />He allows Jobs to insert a last word,and in it Jobs quotes Bob Dylan in what for me sums up the inspiration that can be gleaned from the victories and mistakes that were his life: \\"you're either busy being born, or you're busy dying.\\" If there's nothing else to take away from his life (and there is), it's this concise statement that it is in creation and recreation that we improve and move forward. The minute we stop, though, we might as well be \\"busy dying.\\"and in it Jobs quotes Bob Dylan in what for me sums up the inspiration that can be gleaned from the victories and mistakes that were his life: \\"you're either busy being born, or you're busy dying.\\" If there's nothing else to take away from his life (and there is), it's this concise statement that it is in creation and recreation that we improve and move forward.

B006ZJJ70O|5.0|Although the record box states that these recordings were made from 1954 to 1975, the great majority of them were made from 1973 to 1975, when Stokowski was in his early nineties.  That being said, Stokowski was not an ordinary conductor (or an ordinary physical specimen), judging from what is on these recordings.  Although physically frail from old age, he was alert and able to make music at the highest level until his death in 1977 at the age of 95.<br /><br />In evaluating Stokowski as an interpreter of especially the Romantic era repertoire, some background needs to be provided.  Stokowski was born in 1882, when Brahms, Dvorak, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Tchaikovsky were still alive, and he started conducting at age thirty in 1912, a year after Mahler died. Stokowski cut his teeth in the conducting tradition of Liszt and Wagner as exemplified by such conductors as von Bulow, Richter, Nikisch, Mahler, Furtwangler, and Mengelberg.  These conductors considered it their mission to freely interpret what was on the written page.  They assumed a great deal of liberty in determining tempo and phrasing, and would shift tempi many times within a movement of a symphony. Conductors of this school utilized a great deal of rubato, gear-shifting, and point making in their interpretations.  Many, like Stokowski, also retouched orchestrations, and even recomposed whole sections of music.  Stokowski always held to that style of conducting. For that reason, he can be thought of as the last Romantic conductor.<br /><br />I will briefly survey each of the CD's in this this 14-disc anthology:<br /><br />CD 1 couples the Beethoven \\"Eroica\\" Symphony with his Coriolanus Overture and the Brahms Academic Festival Overture.  The \\"Eroica\\" is to my taste a bit old-fashioned, and the Funeral March could be more hushed and solemn.  Overall, however, it is a nice performance.  The overtures are beautifully played, and the sound on this 1974 disc is excellent.<br /><br />CD 2 features the ShostakovichSymphony #6, the Khachaturian Symphony #3, and a suite from the Shostakovich ballet The Golden Age.  Stokowski almost convinces me that the Shostakovich 6th makes logical musical sense, what with its severe first two movements coupled with a rollicking finale.  For me, the Khachaturian is more bombast than music, and I did not care for it at all.  The Golden age suite was excellently done.  The Chicago Symphony plays beautifully in this 1968 recording, and the sound is first-rate.<br /><br />CD 3 consists of the 1944 Sebastian Ballet suite of Gian Carlo Menotti and selections from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet.  Menotti was somewhat of a classical celebrity in 1954, when this recording was made.  He had enjoyed great success from the premiere of his opera \\"Amahl and the Night Visiors\\" on national television in 1951. The music from Sebastian is beautifully crafted, and well worth a listen.  To my ears, the music from Romeo and Juliet is more controversal.  Stokowski cobbled together the lyrical episodes from the ballet, and gave then the full-string Stokowski treatment, while softening some of the more acerbic parts of the score.  It is all very beautiful, but I like my Prokofiev with more bite.  The sound on this 1954 stereo recording is astonishingly vivid.  In fact, the sound rivals that of the recordings in this set made twenty years later!<br /><br />CD 4 & CD 5 feature selections from the operas of Richard Wagner.  Stokowski was very much in his element in this music.  The recorded sound from 1961 and from 1973-74 is very good to excellent, with the sound being superior on the newer recordings.<br /><br />CD 6 features the Norman Luboff choir with large orchestral accompaniment.  I know this sort of music making was very popular in the 50's and 60's, but it is not really my cup of tea, although the choir sings magnificently and the recorded soumd is gorgeous.  Handel's suites from the Water Music and, on CD 11, the Music for the Royal Fireworks, are presumablyin Stokowski's own large orchestra arrangements.  The performances are anachronistic as all get out, but they are fun to listen to.  The 1961 sound is good, but a little dry.<br /><br />CD 7 features soprano Anna Moffo in Canteloube's Chants d'Auvergne, Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras #5, and the Rachmaninov Vocalise. Ms. Moffo is a delight as usual, but she is no match for Netnia Davrath in the Canteloube songs on Vanguard.  This is a very satisfying disc, well recorded.<br /><br />CD 8 consists of the Dvorak Symphony #9 \\"From the New World\\" with shorter works by Smetana, and CD 9 consists of the Tchaikovsky Symphony #6 \\"Pathetique\\" with shorter works by Liszt and Enescu.<br />The shorter works, the Smetana Moldau and Bartered Bride Overture, the Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody #2, and the Enescu Roumanian Rhapsody #1 have been recently available on an RCA Living Stereo SACD called \\"Rhapsody\\".  The performances are typical of the conductor: Lush strings, strong bass lines, and some sometimes quirky phrasing.  They are also very exciting, and the sound is good 1960 vintage.<br /><br />Stokowsky's interpretation of the Largo of the \\"New World\\" Symphony and the last movement of the \\"Pathetique\\" are the most straightfoward and, in my opinion, the most successful movements of these symphonies.  To me, Stokowski engages in needless and unconvincing point making in the last movement of the Dvorak and the first movement of the Tchaikovsky.There are more mannerisms elsewhere (such as the needless trill at the end of the first movement of the Dvorak), but these are minor blemishes, and they don't disrupt the flow of the music. These two symphonies sound as if a time capsule from the 1920's had been opened. But in Stokowski's defense, he lived when these works were new, and that is how they were performed.  As far as he was concerned, and maybe rightly so, his interpretations should be how these symphonies should be played now.  We talk about wanting to hear historically informedperformance practices of Baroque, Classical, and early Romantic music, for which there aren't any recordings by musicians who lived in that era.  Yet, we dismiss and/or disparage the liberties that a Stokowski, Furtwangler, or Mengelberf might take in their interpretations of Romantic music.  Like or not, these conductors may have given us historically informed performances.<br /><br />CD 10 couples Stokowski's sixth recording of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade with his Russian Easter Overture. Stokowski's previous recording of Scheherazade was in 1964 on a London Phase 4 recording.  The performance grabbed you by the throat from the opering bars and took you on a magic carpet ride, until it let you down at the close of the piece.  The recording was close-up, bright, brash, with a great deal of artificial spotlighting. In the newer recording, Stokowski starts more slowly and methodically and voluptuously bulilds up to the climatic last movement.  It is an interesting conception, and it is pulled off brillantly.  The recording sound is consistent with the interpretation, and is much better balanced than his earlier recording.  I liked this performance and also the accompanying Russian Easter Overture.<br /><br />CD 11 is devoted to Stokowski's orchestral transcriptions of the music of J.S. Bach.  The sound is bold, lush, with a strong bottom end.  The disc makes a good hi-fi demonstration disc, but just a few of these transcriptions go a long way.<br /><br />The Brahms Symphony #4 (CD 12) is a young man's Brahms.  The performance is fast, cool, and very exciting. I liked it a great deal.  The Mahler Symphony #2 \\"Resurrection\\" (CD 12 & 13) is, for Stokowski, very straighfoward.  After a somewhat measured first movement, the middle three movements are played very conventionally.  The lead-in in to the last movement is very impressive, and the whole movement goes quite nicely.  If I had a quibble about the recording, it is, that in the Urlight movement, Brigitte Fassbender is recorded too loudly, and the recording does not allow her voice to die out before beginning the last movement.  The sound on both the Brahms and the Mahler is exemplary.<br /><br />To sum up, the RCA Stokowski box features thirteen CD's (the fourteenth CD is mostly rehearsals) of captivating, and sometimes maddening performances of some of the standard classical repertoire.  The sound on all the CD's ranges from good to excellent, and is more determined by the recording venue than anything else. The 1970 recordings were made at Walthamstow Town Hall in London, a venue that was famous for its great acoustics and ideal reveberation.  The 1960 recordings were made, for the most part, at the Manhattan Center in New York, where most of Leonard Bernstein's New York Philharmonic recordings were made.  Like on those recordings, the sound of these older recordings is clear, but a bit dry and lacking in bloom.  This box is a very special tribute to a truly great and iconic musician.
0375842209|4.0|\\"Here is a small fact: You are going to die.\\" This is not the opening line of The Book Thief. It's the 5th or 6th, but it's a grabber, no? And it just about sums about the book. The Book Thief is all about death. It's set in WWII, Germany, features a young girl who's parents are communists and gets sent to live a poor foster home. Not heavy enough for you? OK, then let's make Death the narrator.<br /><br />I'm probably unduly harsh to this book because the build up around it has been so big. An NPR poll just placed it at #10 of Best Teen Reads. #10! Really? Ahead of The Giver, His Dark Materials series, and The Earthsea cycle, and many other tremendous books.<br /><br />Let me be clear: I think The Book Thief is a good book. It's just not a great one. It deals with big ideas, features some wonderful characters, spins a compelling (albeit slow) storyline, and at times, the prose is amazing. But I couldn't help feeling: hadn't I read about this topic before and wasn't it done better? Maybe I'm a purist but isn't The Book Thief is a pale shadow next to The Diary of Anne Frank or Night by Elie Wiesel?<br /><br />Perhaps whether you love or hate this book depends if you like the death as narrator thing. It didn't really work for me.<br /><br />While Zusak tries to disassociate death from the myth--death denies using a sickle or wearing robes--but he's still a \\"person\\" running around the world collecting souls like some nightmare anti-Santa Claus.<br /><br />I found it to be \\"too cute\\" of a device.<br /><br />The novel is also overwritten in other ways--the 500+ pages is evidence enough. What I mean is Zusak often tries to tell the story in a specialized way for no apparent reason. For instance, Death fixates on colors. Interesting, but what does that have to do with anything?<br /><br />One more thing you should know before you pick it up: the narrator often gives away what's going to happen before it happens. Again this can work in novels (see all time great 100 Years of Solitude), but in The Book Thief it is done constantly. And this is a sad, sad book. (Did I mention it's set in WWII Germany?) I don't know about you, but there are only so many times I can be told that a favorite character is going to die before I stop caring.f Solitude), but in The Book Thief it is done constantly. And this is a sad, sad book. (Did I mention it's set in WWII Germany?)

B004SH40BQ|5.0|I purchased this bluetooth adapter for my pre-bluetooth iPod touch so I could listen to tunes from my iPod on long motorcycle trips.  My helmet is equipped with a Sena bluetooth system which provides excellent bike to bike/cell phone/GPS communications but since I own a pre-bluetooth iPod touch I was still using a cord connection for my music.  The KOKKIA i10s looked to be just what I needed to completely cut the cords while traveling by bike.  The adapter is very small and works on both my iPod mini and my iPod touch.  The sound is excellent and while the adapter does shorten the battery life of my iPod, it still manages to provide tunes for a long days ride.  This is an excellent product.
0061002747|5.0|This is one of Poirot's travel mysteries, resembling to a large extent \\"Death on the Nile\\" and \\"Evil Under the Sun\\".  A murder happens on a train.  Everyone on that coach is suspect, and the murderer must be one of them.  Furthermore, the isolated setting means there is no official police, and no means of fact-checking other than the statements of the characters, which can have truths or lies.  Definitely one of Christie's best, you're rewarded with a twist at the end, and admiration for Poirot's delicate handling of the whole affair.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is not romance, it is not erotica and it's not BDSM, so what is it? I simply am at a loss to understand why so many people like this book. It was so boring I had to throw water on my face to stay awake and keep reading. I don't know anything about romance, I thought this was erotica/BDSM. It really isn't. If you're looking for erotica/BDSM, I highly recommend Stephanie Eliot's books, and also Nina Lane;s - both available here on Kindle, and both offering the Real Deal ... stories that actually deliver what I thought this book had ... don't get this book!

B007WCJSWA|5.0|Mike Stern's \\"All over the place\\" is a wonderful release. It features Richard Bona, Kenny Garrett, Randy Brecker and Esperanza Spaulding just to name a few. The compositions are strong, and I can describe it best by saying this is one of those albums that is a joy to listen to all the way through. Mike's playing is terrific as are all the guests on this album. The title says it...the songs have many different styles and feels it truly is \\"All over the place\\"...but every one of them is a joy to hear. I keep going back to this in the car cd player. Love listening to this one while driving around town.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Wasn't sure what type of blue ray would cost only $6, but it was a great snag. Got this the next day, and makes a addition to my new BlueRay collection. Great movie, and i would 100% suggest it for you. Thanks....
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I am still giggling at the title I have written.<br /><br />I always expected this to work well (having owned the FiiO E5) and I was not disappointed: The lights are bright and informative, the sound changes are blatant, the sound quality is increased to an excellent level, and the volume increase (a priority for me) could nearly be called \\"massive.\\"<br /><br />The only thing I consider a problem is the fact that the switch changes the EQ if slid one way, and locks if slid the other way. When it locks, it actually clicks in place. To unlock it, one must apply a bit of pressure, whereupon it will suddenly click unlocked and jerk across to the other side, thus changing the EQ accidentally. One must actually be extremely, meticulously careful when switching to avoid jerking it across and changing the EQ; sometimes, I consider it easier to simply push it all the way across and cycle through all of the EQs and back to the one I want it on.<br /><br />Other than that, it is perfect. Here's hoping it works as well on my Ultrasone 780 headphones!
B003UESJHY|5.0|The fighter is a movie that you have to check out. I was sucked into this movie from the beginning. Christian Bale delivers an excellent performance and Mark Whalberg is just as superb. The story of this movie shows how family can look out for you and also look out for themselves. There are many obstacles for Whalbergs character while his older brother who use to be a top boxer suffers from drug addiction and being self absorbed. I don't want to give too much away. If you have not seen this movie check it out ASAP.

0977476073|5.0|A superb and accurate translation of Mein Kampf without the usual political diversions.  Ford explains certain cultural and historical aspects necessary to understand the context of the references Hitler makes in this book.  He also explains the style.  Mein Kampf, A Translation Controversy is a nice companion to this book and is available free to download from Ford's website, which is heavily advertised in this book.  Ford also offers other free references as well.
1612183956|3.0|The publisher's description of \\"Pines\\" makes it sounds dark and clever and creepy in a \\"Twin Peaks\\" kind of way, but I actually found this book to rely too much on gruesome violence: There are people digging knives deep into their legs, someone being wheeled into surgery without anesthesia by sadistic doctors, a corpse that we learn was horribly tortured--in gruesome detail--before the person died, etc.<br /><br />I would have preferred something a little more subtle and a little less reliant on gruesome descriptions of torture.<br /><br />But, hey, that's just me.
097747609X|3.0|Unless you are a hard-core student of history, this translation isn't really necessary.  It is incomplete and the original translator didn't even finish it, since he fled Germany before it was finished (he was English).  There are a lot of inaccuracies built in to the translation.  If you read a Mein Kampf, a Translation Controversy, you will get the gist of the errors in this one.  For that reason, Mein Kampf, a Translation Controversy should have been fleshed out more to include more examples (as I stated in my review of that one).

030758836X|2.0|The overall premise is a bit unbelievable, and the front and middle bits--while initially promising--became predictable and cliched. The last several chapters are far-fetched and uninteresting. It's a fast read. It's nothing I'd recommend, there's nothing memorable about it.

I was sad and excited all at the same time and felt anger towards the system that failed this young girl.  I commend her for having the courage to write a book and give details of something I am sure she wants to forget and put behind her.  I am excited to read a follow up about her successes after tragedy.

B0031RAOVY|4.0|I do not have a pet; nor do I desire to ever own one.  I am not one of those people who bestow human qualities upon an animal and treat it as a person, even going so far as to dress it like one.  That being said, I believe that such people and even people like me will consider the time spent watching \\"Hachi (A dog's tale)\\" well worth the effort.<br />\\"Hachi\\" is an Americanized version of the true story about a remarkable dog that once lived in Japan. Besides the dog, the movie stars Richard Gere and Joan Allen.  It is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who also directed \\"Cider House Rules\\".<br />Hachi is abandoned on a commuter train when just a pup.  The character portrayed by Richard Gere takes it home with him.  Predictably, a stong bond of mutual admiration, respect, and love gradually forms between the two; much to the dismay of the man's wife (Joan Allen), at least initially.<br />Hachi eventually endears himself to the entire family, extended family, and a large portion of the town's population; not because the dog exhibits unbelievable skills or talent, which it doesn't, but because it possesses and displays innate qualities of pride, independence, loyality, and determination that would put those of most humans to shame.  The casual viewer will soon find himself emotionally involved in and truly admiring of this dog's life.  Warning: The dog dies at the end.  I do not consider this a spoiler, since we all die at the end.  I just wanted to prepare those who may require a box of tissues to be close at hand in such circumstances.

B000002MFQ|4.0|To the casual listener all these Tubular Bells releases must be a little confusing. Well let me clarify, Tubular Bells II is something of a sequel to the 1973 original, it's structure mirrors that of the original but is the sound of a genius in the art of variation on a theme.<br /><br />Is it as good? Well that can only be a matter of taste but here's my dollars worth. Tubular Bells II is perhaps, melodically speaking, Oldfield's biggest triumph and considering this is a composer in the same ball park as Bach or Vivaldi that's really saying something. When this music grabs you you can't let go, it's totally addictive. The way in which melodies across the whole album relate to one another is masterful and hypnotic. As with all of Oldfield's best albums you will find new layers of instruments with almost every listen, even after twenty years!<br /><br />My only issue with this album is it's production, at times I find the sound a little cheesy and synthetic, that's not to say it isn't jam packed with hand-played instruments because you name it and it's on here; banjos, mandolins, an array of guitars and all the rest. I can 't help feeling that Trevor Horn's influence placed the album firmly in the early 90's where as much of Oldfield's best stuff is timeless. However, it is possible to filter out the production values becuase the melodies are so strong and anyway, you may love the sound of those synths.<br /><br />I recommend seeking out The Bell single CD2, as it's B-sides feature the original MC Vivian Stanshall and also the hilarious Scottish comedian Billy Connolly both of which are much better than the dry and frankly dull Alan Rickman!<br /><br />My other recommendation for those who love the multi-layering, guitar wielding Oldfield of old is to listen to an album called Mohribold by Andrew Taylor (google it). Taylor has clearly soaked up all of Oldfield's classics and given us a contemporary instrumental classic. I found it on a site called bandcamp and have enthused about it to all who will listen.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Every now and then a book (or series of books) reminds you why you like to read.  I was in a bit of a reading rut and was methodically turning pages because it's what I'm used to doing.  This book changed that, I would try to get home from work early and then I'd stay up late so I could read.  I loved the plot, setting and characters.  I was truly sad when I finished the series, I want more.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|The voices were glorious, but I personally was not as moved as I was in other productions of La Boheme.  Perhaps because it was made as a film, with too many closeups but not enough body language to convey their emotions.  Voices and beautiful singers aside,  I find faults with Anna's makeup, she is supposed to be a bohemian, but has perfect makeup all the time, and certainly doesn't look like she is sick.  In the final scene, I don't understand why on her deathbed, she is in a sleeveless top while everyone around her has coats or heavy clothes on.  Something just feel out of sync in this production.
0345803485|1.0|Thank God I had a gift card so I didn't waste my hard earned money on this ridiculous piece of literary garbage.<br /><br />Originally when I picked this book up, I wasn't expecting a brilliant masterpiece. I wasn't expecting to be wowed by the author's choice of diction, or her intellectually stimulated by her ingenious imagery and wit. I was expecting a light romance novel, something on par to what I experienced when I read Twilight. But what I got instead was a poorly written, poorly devised, poorly IMAGINED piece of junk. I don't get it. I just. Don't. Get it.<br /><br />I realize that this is a work of fanfiction originally (which is fine, I myself write plenty of fanfiction) but the characters lack SO much emotional depth, are pithy at best, and spin in circles with no development, no intrigue, no... no art. Characters repeat themselves verbatim, Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" blushes, bites her lip, groans, squirms, WHATEVER on nearly EVERY SINGLE PAGE.If you are a writer, wouldn't you want to take PRIDE in what you write? Wouldn't you at least RESEARCH the pacific northwest before you set a book there? Wouldn't you take the time to LEARN American phrases, instead of inserting your own British colloquialisms ad hoc? \\"Jeez\\", wouldn't you put some EFFORT into what you do?<br /><br />This book, and the fact that it has exploded in America and has remained on bestseller lists for months, is a tragedy. It's a tragedy because there are THOUSANDS of writers how take their profession seriously and are proud of what they write, but will never see a tenth of the success of EL James. The fact that EL James piggy-backed onto the success of another author, watered down her characters AND their emotions, and has sold millions of copies of her books astounds me. Stephanie Meyer herself can barely write, but EL James is somehow (something I never thought possible) worse than Meyer, and is a millionaire because of it.<br /><br />And Focus Features just paid over 5 million dollars forthe right to MAKE this film? I don't get it. Am I missing something? Is there some brilliant literary metaphor burried deep within this book that I just didn't catch? Is this supposed to mock our society? The fact that THIS BOOK could be a BESTSELLER?? Is that what EL James is saying? Because if she is, mad props. I get that. But she's not.<br /><br />If I could give this book ZERO STARS, I would. If anyone is reading this, DON'T waste your time, or your money. You'll thank me later.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Twihards. I don't get. I just don't get it.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Another Thing Movie. I own all of them but my favorite was when James Arness first made me almost not make it to the little boys room in time! Lets face the facts with all the fx back then they did a great job, especially when the arm started moving on the table. Now I liked the end of this last one the way they showed that it was the story of what happened to the Norwegians which was the beginning of The Thing of John Carpenter. What we need is the sequel to the end of John's Thing that will be a huge hit I believe and any of The Thing groupies as I am problely are waiting also. The FX in this one were good but the ship was fantastic I thought. The FX for the creatures excellent. And I did like the way the main actor,<br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead took charge with the flame thrower. She did a great job I thought through the movie. So let's get on the ship and make a sequel the will make you movie makers the big bucks and remember in any of The Thing movies there was no sex so let's keep the subject matter clean for the new generation of The Thing kids. Oh yea I got this from the only place I buy all my movies Amazon.com for when you have a problem with any of the movies or other items you can buy from them they make sure you are well taken care of !

The whole time I felt like I was Katniss, I could feel all the pain and emotion she went through. I didnt get bored at one point in this book because you keep wanting to find out more, or what happens next. It is so intense, gruesome, emotional, and super amazing! I recommend this book to people maybe 10 and up because so many of my friends and I read it when we were around 10 or 11. This is the best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
1469984202|5.0|I rate 3 stars when the book fills downtime and the story or characters move along.  4 when I will make time to read because it has my interest.  5 when I find well developed plotlines, characters that could be as real as you or me, and the ability to string together memorable lines time and again.  I will be adding Hugh to my authors to read going forward.  A thanks also to Mike Gallagher for noting the good read in his books and tips blog.  I will pay regular prices for my next Hugh book.

1936608898|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm a long-time Whole9 devotee, and I've even been to one of Dallas & Melissa's seminars.<br /><br />For me, this book was useful as a refresher to the seminar I attended in January 2011, and it furthered my knowledge beyond what I anticipated.  Less than $18?  Totally worth it.<br /><br />I'm in the medical community--I really like this book for patients, especially diabetics, because it explains the way our body works in relation to food so well.  I've already shared it with one of my colleagues.  The analogies used are simple enough that a lay person can understanding, but not too dumbed down that there isn't any substance.<br /><br />I think this book should be #1 on the list for someone looking into the \\"Paleo\\" lifestyle.  I also think this this book should be #1 on the list for someone who has a condition like RA, fibromyalgia, GI distress, etc.  I think that It Starts With Food should be one of the first books a newly diagnosed (or longstanding uncontrolled/semi-controlled) diabetic should pick up!<br /><br />The concept is phenomenal.  And simple.  Eliminate all the less healthy stuff, take your time reintroducing things that you want to reintroduce, see what happens.  Doesn't work?  Well, at least you gave it a shot.  It's only 30 days.

1468161660|4.0|Enjoyed Slammed........great characters, good story, and I do believe in love at first sight. Love is chemical not rational and haven't we all met various people we were drawn too without explanation ?  Will comes across as one of the finest guys anyone would ever want to meet, level headed, loving and a great since of responsibility.  One of the best parts of the book was when Will told Lake and Eddy off by telling them that after his parents death how he pushed his hopes and dreams aside to step up and do what was right by picking up his little brother and raising  him as his own, becoming a working parent at 21 years old.....because it was the right thing to do, only to end by walking out of the room.......and Eddy makes the statement to Lake........how do you not love him ?  Yea I thought the same thing.  Wish there were more Will's in the world !  Good book !

1609611543|5.0|I devoured this book in 48 hours.  At last, a concise, well-written, down to earth explanation of why I feel so much better after voluntarily ditching wheat forever.  My friends, family, and co-workers all think I am crazy but here is proof I am not!  Dr. Davis lays all the cards on the table and calls out the ADA, FDA, and AMA for their misguided (if well intended) dietary advice.  If you DON'T believe that wheat is murder, then you seriously need to check this out.  If you've been considering going wheat free but are on the fence, this will push you over the edge. I will NEVER eat any form of wheat again.  You owe it to yourself to check out the facts, and this book is full of them.<br />p.s. I have lost 18 pounds with no exercise and eating whenever I feel like, as much as I feel like, just by forgoing wheat. I had tried exercise, other diets, gym memberships, to no avail. Try it, what do you have to lose?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Thank you so much for offering this app.  For as much as we use our Kindle Fire's, this app keeps us going without interruption.  We sincerely couldn't do without it!  Again, the effort put into creating this tool is much appreciated.  You all rule!

034580404X|5.0|A must read cant go wrong with this trilogy!!! My wife finished the series in a week!! Once your lured in your hooked from there on out!!
1608870081|4.0|This book is fantastic! i admit i'm not a hardcore Harry Potter fan (I'm a casual fan), but the book doesnt fail to surprise me at every turn of the page. the book itself is sturdy and filled with wonderful drawings/illustrations. but the best part of the book is of course, the paper engineering technology and manage to pop the illustrations out, creating the magical awe.<br /><br />as for the drawback of the book, the illustrations printed are darker and not as clear as i expected it to be. i was hoping it would be of higher resolution (clearer) and the colors should be more vibrant. and for the page with the dragon, the head of the dragon doesnt lift up upon opening the page (as opposed to what is shown in the promotional video of this book), thus the dragon appears to be looking at its own chest.<br /><br />overall, this book still delivers what it has promised to do and i'd definitely recommend it to harry potter's fan as well as pop-up book collectors alike!<br /><br />p/s i'd like to take a moment to review amazon's delivery service as well. i'm very very happy with the international shipping provided by amazon to my country (malaysia). i ordered 2 books and it was packed in a small parcel, protected by a couple of air bags. the parcel didnt arrive in a very good shape though. one of its edge was already torn and i can see the content inside, least to say if any liquid (e.g. rain, etc) fall into it, my books would have been damaged. FORTUNATELY, the content did not suffer the same fate. the books are still almost fully intact (i'd say  95% of it). one of my books suffered a 5% damage at the corner of the book. most importantly, the parcel arrived way earlier than the estimated arrival date. the estimated arrival is 6 weeks from the time of ordering to the time of arrival at my doorstep, but the parcel managed to make it to my doorstep in exactly 3 weeks time. all in all, amazon really made my day with these deliveries and i'll surely purchase more items from them again!

B007V508CC|1.0|When I first heard Song about Jane I thought it was terrific.  Since then, in the last few albums the group has sold out.  What was once fresh and creative music has turned into pablum.  Don't waste your time or money on this junk
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am now on the final book in this trilogy and it is pretty good.  Easy to read.  Has a dark side that is interesting to say the least.  I don't recommend this book to someone who is not comfortable with sex.  However, if that doesn't bother you, it's pretty good.  I am enjoying watching the characters grow and develope and overcome their dark feelings and learning to love in a good way.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I do occasionally visit Pinterest for ideas, but using this app just makes me irritated. you only get two thin rows of pictures in the center of the screen, which makes it very difficult to see what they are. Also, the very first time I used it, the app locked up on me and the only way out was a full shutdown of my Kindle Fire. No force close with an option to close it, just a full on lockup. That's bad!  I can do without this app and just visit on my computer when I feel I want to go to that site.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|predictable, uninspiring, I honestly feel the only reason this book is so popular is due to all the xxx sex scenes.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|i really like this browser much better than the one that comes on most tablets. Being able to assign key strokes to take you to a web page is a real plus.<br /><br />On the negative side the browser is sometimes really slow  to update pages.

B00702NWW4|3.0|Personally, I don't see why there is so much hype over this singer and this CD. It's ok, she's ok, it doesn't suck, but it's nothing great. Her voice is pretty good, the songs are decent. She doesn't have much of a range, but it is ok music to have on in the background. I just think it's very overrated.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|All I can say is that this movie is by far my favorite movie of all time. Until recently, the last time I saw it was when it came out, and I can just tell you that I have a MUCH better appreciation of the movie after watching it several times now. Everything about it is spectacular--especially the love story between Jack and Rose. Amazing is one word I would choose to describe this movie.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|The music on this album is in my very humble opinion the epitome of metal. The opening song Iconoclast absolutely shreds- awesome metal riffage and stellar drums to boot. Jason Rullo's chops have really grown over the years and really shine through on this album. My only criticism would be the deficiency of clean (vrs. gruff) vocals on this album. I'm a big Russel Allen fan, I just personally think he's at his best when he's not so gruff. There is also a decrease in symphonic keyboards on this album, which I have mixed feelings about. I'm guessing this has a little to do with the new Nuclear Blast label. However, in total this is a great album if a slight deviation from their former, more symphonic form. Please buy and enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have totally enjoyed reading this \\"adventure\\".  I have finished this first book and am now well on my way into the second.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice little app that is good at what it does. What it does is give you a quick snapshot of weather in your chosen area. If you are looking for something more in depth then this app is not for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love his writing and the suspense and twists and turns. He writes with heart and caring.  His books always bring me back and make me want to finish it.  Safe Haven was a surprise in the end which i truly appreciated since i felt it was just another love story.  KUDOS
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book was an interesting read but the author was in too big a hurry to tie up all the loose plot pieces.  All the loose ends come together very wuickly and too neatly for me.  I'd rather there be a fourth book that adds some much needed substancee to the events.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading the trilogy, I'm hoping they play the characters well in this movie. It's gonna be a big hit!! Every man should read this book. Lol

030758836X|5.0|I will start by saying that Gone Girl is the BEST book I have read to-date this year. It is a must read whodunit thriller that tells the story of a husband and wife starting on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary. That is the day that the wife, Amy, goes missing. Each chapter unfolds new information on her disappearance and puts the husband, Nick, under a great deal of scrutiny that he may have murdered his wife. This book is full of plot twists and psychological warfare. It's extremely difficult to put down and you will want to continue reading without interruption to find our how everything turns out.
0810994739|3.0|(2.5)<br />The film adaptation of this book was the first of 10 movies that kicked off the $1 summer kid series at our local theatre.  The kids and I went to see it and I actually liked it!  I stumbled into the book about a month later in my son's book collection and thought, \\"Why not? I'm having a reading slump, I could use a laugh.\\".  So I read it and I definitely like the movie better!  The film version gave it a story with heart.  The book was just more antics (like first book) and was just not for me.  My 5 and 9 year-olds liked it though.  I guess I'm not a kid at heart after all!! ;)<br /><br />Sidenote: We saw the film adaptation of book #4, Dog Days, when it came out this summer and it was a hoot!

B003KVKQB4|5.0|A highly readable and educating account about the tools used (mostly by the United States) in the war between free market and freedom around the world.
B007LEC7CC|4.0|As the lyrics in one of my favorite songs off MDNA indicate, she could have rode off into the sunset long ago to \\"run naked on a beach and written her name across the sky.\\"  She didn't.  Her detractors say she hungers for more fame and money but that argument falls flat on it's face.  Who could possibly become more famous?  She has generated billions in revenue for her record labels and tour promoters, while amassing personal wealth of nearly $1 billion dollars.<br /><br />This record, as with all of her later recordings is about music and the message.  She gives her fans moments of joy while sharing her talent, experience, hard work and love.  Every artist has peaks and valleys in sales, specially with file sharing and technological advancement.  MDNA had modest sales (even though it did hit #1 on the charts) she still enjoys her craft and obviously enjoys entertaining.<br /><br />Why else would a woman who already accumulated unprecedented personal wealth andfame bother to work so hard on creating dazzling concert tours to complete the musical experience of the audio MDNA with a theatrical story, a presentation on the stage that defies gravity  and sends millions of fans home with a magical piece of energy that will remain with them for a lifetime.<br /><br />I've been a fan since 1985's \\"The Virgin Tour\\".  With such a massive catalogue of music, it is impossible to puck a favorite song or album.  MDNA may have had a few blemishes and was not as satisfying wall-to-wall as some of Madonna's other albums, but there are some superb songs on the record.  You have to LISTEN (hard to do in this day and age of short attention spans) and when I listen, I hear honest,  heartfelt lyrics in her ballads; fun, sexy dance beats on her pop/club hits.<br /><br />MDNA, like all of her albums dating back to 1983 offer somthing for everyone, young and old, wild or tame, silly or serious.  Her musical artistry I'd FUN if you let yourself cut loose and enjoy it.  Why not?  We've all spent more money on items that were less interesting and valuable.  I say go for it!!!  -VA+pent more money on items that were less interesting and valuable.  I say go for it!!!  -VA+

B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It kept me glued to the pages with characters I could actually visualize.  I came to know them as friends and shared their triumphant and sorrows.  I.have read books from Gone With the Wind to spy stories, but none came this close enveloping my into their story!
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Excellent CD.  What a FABALOUS voice this woman has!  New star rising.  Keep an eye on her for for great songs.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is ten times smoother than the mobile version of the site. It makes repinning simple and fast. It even allows me to pin from a website on my mobile device.  I love it and I'm sure it will just get better and better!

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I bought this product in November of 2011 and I've had headache after headache with this headset. After two months of purchasing this headset the wiring screwed up and sound was coming out of one side of the headset only after I put the headset on to watch netflix on my ps3. Further research online concluded that the wiring headset is very poorly designed and you have to be extremely careful (which I am extremely careful with gaming headsets) with this headset or it will break easily. I contacted turtle beach customer support and the return/fix policy is a crude joke. They want you to return the headset to them at your time and money by paying the postage back to the company, they want the headset perfectly clean and if it isn't clean they will send it back to you which is wasted money and last but not least it takes 2-3 weeks to repair or give you a new headset and during this time the don't give any updates (none via email, phone, or text messages) if your package has been receive or sent out to you and they recommend that you buy your own tracking number for the package in the first place. That being said I am currently going through this process again after the fact I received a new headset 5 months ago out of the box as a replacement which yet again it is broken after I simply decided put on my headset and the plastic swivel decide to break off after being very careful with this headset in the first place. When the headset was working the quality was good not the best but decent when they worked. My suggestion to everyone is that I would not invested long term in this headset and don't waste your time with this headset. Look for a headset 100-200 range with better sound quality and customer service.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am addicted to this game.  It allows my mind to get sharper while playing a game.  It's the adult version of memory.
B002VECMAO|5.0|The Men Who Stare At Goats is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my entire life.  I laugh just thinking about it.  Either you love it or you hate it.  The reality is I could relate.  Being a military buff and ex-USAF stationed at Pope AFB (right next to Fort Bragg (which was one of the main locations in the film) and deployed to Afghanistan and spent a descent time in Iraq, I know and understand the military and there culture.  This completely makes a mockery of it yet doesn't.  I actually believe the US military might have potentially tried something like this (Psy Ops).  It's not that far fetched.<br /><br />Anyways, watch it, love it, enjoy.  If you didn't like it, you probably never served in the military.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Haven't been able to put it down since purchasing it.<br />Offers lots of levels, from simple to challenging. Great game!
B00012FXAE|5.0|A classic film in my opinion.<br />It was nice to have the extended version that included the deleted scenes.<br />I much prefer this longer version simply for the remote sentry segment.<br />However, the theater cut down version is also there for those that prefer it.<br />The extras and commentary were informative and interesting.<br />All in all, a nice DVD to own and enjoy.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|great application! extremely usable. totally worth it. it has a lot of great options.. this application is really helpful for school, work, and keeps you on the right track...
0439023483|5.0|The book is loaded with suspense and keeps you wanting to know more. That said its hard to put the book down. Much more detail and background than the movie can bring gives great perspective into the mind of Katniss, district 12 and the history of the games. Highly recommended.

B000031WYP|5.0|Granting the problematic change in volume levels at the start (perhaps the singer is meant to be heard from offstage?), this is a pearl of a little-known opera.<br />Don't be scared off.  It is NOT 'unlistenable.'  DO NOT turn up the volume for the very, very quiet first aria, and you'll be fine.
B005HERPGG|5.0|The premise of the episode is that Picard is kidnapped and replaced with an identical impostor on the ship. No one seems to notice the impostor, but this Picard's unusual behaviors such as singing a beer song with the crew starts some eyebrow-raising. Meanwhile, the real Picard is held prisoner in a holding cell that includes a member of a non-violent species, a member of an anarchist species, and a Starfleet cadet. As expected, Picard does not accept his conditions and leads his fellow inmates in attempts to discover a way out. As the impostor's behaviors progress in unusual manners, the senior officers begin to talk mutiny. This goes on for almost the entire episode, leaving the viewer very engaged as to what will happen next.<br /><br />Ultimately, the real Picard figures out that the Starfleet cadet in the captivity room is in fact one of the captors. It is then revealed that the 3 captives were being studied so that the aliens can learn about leadership under stress. Picard is finally returned to his ship. It is at this moment that the episode has a satisfying conclusion: Picard outsmarts the alien captors and actually locks them up in a force field. He then lectures to them a bit, and then releases them with a sturdy \\"Now, get off my ship!\\".<br /><br />Themes explored include the question, \\"can all of a mind's memories and experiences be copied into a perfect replica of the person and expect that person to act as usual?\\" Command and leadership are also explored. Interesting to watch is a slightly different version of Picard at work (more lighthearted and apparently affectionate). Great episode!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|i am totally taken by this game. one really must  use the grey matter. very  important  for mind  stimulation.  happy i tried it. thanks to those who developed it.

1476712042|4.0|Abby Abernathy has a past that she is trying desperately to escape.  Going away to college and reinventing herself is easy, but staying away from dangerous reminders of her past proves to be the hard part.  Travis Maddox is the typical bad boy and someone who is dangerous for her new reality. His reputation with women and violent pastimes makes her keep her distance, but his pull is just too strong.  Their relationship begins with a bet and from there it is an intense, dysfunctional love that threatens to throw Abby back into the life she is running from.<br />Trying to come up with a rational explanation of why I liked this book as much as I did is also hard. I will begin with what I didn't like.  Even though her past is revealed there is not a lot of detail to it.  It had a \\"by the way\\" feel to it when it was actually the most important part of Abby's story.  Her best friend, America, who is also a very important figure in her past and present isn't given a lot of depth either. I think I could have believed in Abby's character thoroughly with a little more explanation.<br />Dysfunction is reality and I am going to attribute that to why I liked this one.  Abby and Travis' relationship, especially in the beginning and the end of the book, is so toxic that it is begging for a talk show psychologist. I found myself smiling or laughing because I know couples who drive onlookers crazy and leave them shaking their heads. I got sucked into the push and pull of this love story mainly because of the dysfunction and I found myself ignoring phone calls just to get to the end to see whose strong, stubborn, and sometimes psychotic personality was going to prevail.  This is a hard one to recommend since most people like their love stories to be happy and harmonious and this is not that book.  I do recommend it to anyone who can get around aggressive language and who can put down their rose colored glasses.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|This book was exactly as good as Shiver was.  If you loved Shiver, you'll like this book.  If you hated Shiver, you'll hate this book.  I'm on the fence if I like it or not but it's my first wolf book so I didn't know what to expect.  I recommend it if you like twilight-type books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book and very easy to read on my Kindle.  Exciting book and now I want to view the movie.  Books like this will encourage children to read and hopefully improve their reading skills.

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This glass cutter truly works.  The first bottle I tried, I didn't apply enough pressure.  The second bottle I tried, I think I over scored it or did not apply even pressure as the cut wasn't totally clean.  The third time, I applied even pressure and did not over score and it broke perfectly!  Now that I have the hang of it, I am looking all over for glass to cut!  So easy, really.  And, I didn't use the water the way they suggest.  I boiled water in a tea kettle and set aside while I scored the bottle (did not keep it boiling - just hot).  Then, while over the sink, I poured the hot water from the tea kettle just over the score for 5 seconds, then ran the score under cold water right from the faucet for 5 seconds, then back to running the hot water over the score for 5 seconds and the glass broke - just 15 seconds total for each bottle I've done.

1468161660|5.0|I ordered this book and when it came I read the back cover. DO NOT READ THE BACK COVER. It made me not want to read the book so I didnt for a couple weeks , but then decided oh well I will give it a shot. Glad I did because it was a really good book. I like many others read this book in one day could not put it down. This book has a great story and romance but make sure you have a box of tissues because you will need them. I have tear stains on the pages of my book but I am glad I read it very different from the other books I have been reading lately (fifty shades, bared to you also great books) but what a good read. Make sure if you buy this book you also buy the sequel but make sure you have two boxes of tissues for that book.

B004T4KQJS|5.0|Great book to learn the basics of cosmology. I love how Krauss explains how our knowledge of the universe developed and what scientists were thinking at the times they were uncovering these mysteries. Also does a great job explaining the physical phenomena so that readers with little knowledge of physics can understand while at the same time making it an interesting and rewarding read for those who have a strong backgrounds in math and physics.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very functional keyboard! Gotta love auto predictions and how this thing learns from you the more you use it! Got it when it was the free app of the day, but I think I would definitely pay for this if needed.
156224003X|2.0|I bought this book because the promising title and its overwhelmingly positive reviews intrigued me.  I even was aware of an 'Effortless Mastery' study group on a piano forum I occasionally follow.  Unfortunately, it was not what I expected.<br /><br />I came away from reading 'Effortless Mastery' with one single substantive idea, and Mr. Werner withholds it until the end.  If you want to spare yourself from wading through his insights on life and culture (and a whole lot of warm and fuzzy new age touchy-feely 'wisdom'), I can distill the crux of Mr. Werner's practical advice into a concise paragraph.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is it.  When learning a piece of music, there are three interdependent factors - speed, accuracy, and the length of the segment being practiced - and one can maintain two of those elements simultaneously but never all three.  So if your concern is strict accuracy, for example, (1) you may practice at the target tempo just a brief fragment, or (2) you may practice a lengthy passage but only at a slow tempo.  One factor must always be sacrificed for the other two until mastery is achieved ('effortless' or otherwise!).<br /><br />Unless you're interested in esoteric musings and advice about meditation, there's nothing else here.  It also bears mentioning that the quality of this book's binding was truly rock-bottom.  By the time I was finished reading, nearly every page had become completely unglued from the spine.  I would happily donate or resell it, but it's just a sheaf of loose pages now.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Time waistin. If you have nothin to do then get the game. I give the game five stars. Get it.
B0083UWX04|5.0|This is an historical issue of some considerable importance coupling, as it does, two key pieces from the repertoire of one of the finest pianists of our time at an early stage in her career. The sleeve comments that this pair of recordings made by the BBC in 1977 have been `lovingly restored, using the finest state-of-the-art technology.' I personally had doubts about the success of this especially as I own fine CDs of the same pieces recorded at a later date by Argerich and which are almost considered benchmark statements.<br /><br />Well I can immediately report that the quality of the restoration has not been exaggerated. The colour imaging is remarkable, especially for its age, and very little allowance need be made here. The sound is presented in good genuine stereo. The camera work is rather less invasive than in some more recent issues and the detailed work gives a clear account of the performance. These comments must be read bearing in mind that this is not of Blu-ray level of course. Nevertheless it is a considerably superior effort to many later non-HD recordings.<br /><br />As regards the actual performances, what we get to share here is absolutely what was to turn Argerich into something of a musical icon in later years. All the characteristics of her later playing are clearly here already and that makes this a fascinating record. I found myself wondering if Charles Groves and Andre Previn, the two conductors, had any inkling at that stage that here was a young pianist who was going to turn into something even more special.<br /><br />What is quite clear is how closely the two conductors follow her every phrase with rapt attention. Their co-ordination of the orchestral requirements with those of Argerich as the performances unfold are object lessons in fine conducting. Other examples of that calibre can be seen in the way Karajan accompanies the young Kissin or Kathleen Battle in the famous New Year's Day concert of 1987.<br /><br />In summary therefore, and in my opinion, any purchaser interested in the outset of the career of Argerich or anyone interested in the art of fine conducting should find this issue to be of riveting interest. The technical aspects of the recording are remarkably good and should not mar the enjoyment of the music making portrayed. Clearly it would be unreasonable to compare this on exactly the same technical level of a Blu-ray recording so this rating is based on different historical and musical criteria as explained above.<br /><br />It seems to me therefore that this is a totally successful restoration of an invaluable historical achievement and well-worth the full 5 stars on that basis.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember the original broadcast of the the Prokofiev on 'Andre Previn's music night' and I do remember him saying in his introduction that 'the piece was incredibly difficult and, here to play it is one of THE great virtuosos...'<br />I agree that this is a superb disc and my only disappointment is that Previn's spoken introduction was omitted.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|After seemingly to bomb at the box office and receive negative reviews, I was a little nervous to watch. However, I got my popcorn ready and told myself it was going to just pass the time. I was surprised to find a story that was a real adventure - in the purest sense of the word - packed with humor and great effects. And yes - a nice romance. I was reminded of the pure fun of the movies like the first couple \\"Indiana Jones\\", \\"The Librarian\\", and even \\"Secondhand Lions\\".<br /><br />This film is a STORY, as in a story one person tells another. It seems outlandish because it is. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun and worth the watch! It isn't all airy lightness and there are some \\"internal demons\\" for our hero to work out and a war being raged on Mars, but they only add to the story. The story is about finding yourself again, despite what brought you to who you are.<br /><br />Highly recommend for family watching - my 15 year old boy watched with me and was very entertained. The cast is solid, and the effects are amazing. Go forth and adventure!
B0002ADY0Q|4.0|Bought for \\"Salisbury\\", but best track was \\"High Priestess\\".  The original LP was great, this is better.  Not just the original 6 songs, but two additional worthwhile unreleased tracks that make it a more complete album.  Sounds kind of like Scorpions.  Say, why doesn't Sirius XM play these guys more?
1849491062|5.0|Peggy Porschen's new book Boutique Baking moves away somewhat from the detailed sugarcraft creations and celebrity style wedding cakes, to a more high-end afternoon tea style.<br /><br />The cakes are as beautiful as ever, and no doubt have already set the trends for cake decorating in 2013. Yet there is still lots to inspire the less experienced cake decorator in this book.<br /><br />In particular, I loved the cake pops served in an ice cream cone rather than on a stick, as well as the show-stopping \\"luscious layer cakes\\" and the beautiful piping on the Glorious Victoria Cake.<br /><br />My favourite cakes of all in the book are the raspberry and rose dome cake - this is a cake shape trend we'll be seeing a lot more of soon, the white chocolate passion cake decorated with birthday candles and triple berry layered cheesecakes. A beautiful finale were the drinks recipes such as pink lemonade, hot white chocolate with vanilla and summer berry ice tea. Exquisite, yet again!

B000FC13MM|5.0|I loved this book. The imagery was amazing, and the story kept me riveted for the entire thing. Sabriel is young, but wise beyond her years, and Touchstone is a tragic hero. The supporting characters are just as well written as the leads, and if I could change anything about the book, I'd want more information on them, particularly Mogget.<br /><br />The basic premise of the world is explained quite well, with enough held back that the other two books in the trilogy will have reason to expand on the magic. The interaction between Sabriel and Touchstone seems real and genuine, and not forced. The ending was so climactic that do not read beyond 85% unless you have time enough to finish the book. I am very much looking forward to the next book in the series.
B000E9910W|5.0|I enjoyed this collection of Doobie Brothers Hits. The quality of the songs are spectacular. I immediately ripped the disks to my computer, and now listen to them while I am working. These are songs from a great group, during our great times...

B008BM9L72|2.0|This trilogy is vastly over rated. The story line is hollow and there are many lost opportunities to give a deeper and reasonable insight into the two main characters. Apart from the titillation not much reading.
B005UD1D62|5.0|I was bored on my flight to New York City and decided to give in and pay $12 or $8. It continues on from the LA candy books and lets you see a different side of Madison. Of course there are new characters and add to the story line... season 2. I can't wait for the new book in October!

0345803485|1.0|I started this book only to see what the hype was all about and I still can't figure it out.  Not a well written book by any stretch of the imagination.  I got to page 100 and said to myself - why am I wasting my time - there are so many other books I could be reading right now.  And even at page 100 I was so sick of her biting her lip all the time - I wanted to hurt her myself and not in a sexual way.

B003YFIUW8|1.0|I should have put this book down half way through but since I rarely pay this much for a book I made myself read it.  It was sad, then sad, then sad with NO real happy ending. It just kind of ended.....If you send the money on this book I hope you like it, but for me it was awful :(

145162607X|5.0|The Kingmaker Richard Neville, as the Earl of Warwick plans to see one of his daughters (Anne or Isabel) sits on the throne as wife to King Edward IV while the loser in his marital sweepstake would wed either royal brother George or Richard.  However, independent Edward destroys Warwick's scheme when he marries his choice ofs a wife while ignoring the demands of the Kingmaker.<br /><br />An irate Neville arranges a marriage between George and Isabel while supporting his son-in-law's revolt to take the throne from Edward.  Meanwhile Anne becomes a widow at fourteen with no protection until the other royal sibling Richard marries her.  Proving a chip off her sire's block, she thrives on regal intrigue that places her, her husband and their children in peril as the War of the Roses continues unabated.<br /><br />The latest Cousins' War of the Roses historical thriller (see The Lady of the Rivers, The Red Queen and The White Queen) is an exciting tale filled with political intrigue as no one is safe from betrayal.  Fast-paced, readers will relish observing the behind the scenes actions of a strong woman who like all females in the fifteenth century hides what she does in a male only world.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B004EQAVHI|4.0|A gripping reverie on expendable organ donors living in quiet desperation, hoping against hope for a deferral.  A metaphor for so many trapped and hopeless souls in real life, filmed in drab yet atmospheric seaside locations in England.

B008OOYALE|5.0|it was fun and I liked it because it was like dragonvale in fact its basically the same thing so you should get it
1401235417|5.0|I'm probably not the first person to tell you this is good but I'm not a really big Batman fan anymore. This still is a good comic and brings a lot of things that I hope stick around with the character.<br /><br />Good:<br />-The villains give Batman a really good fight and at a lot of times it feels like Batman is the under dog so he really has to stretch his abilities to fight this new menace. This makes the fight scenes more intense in action. The mystery is also very well done.<br />-The relevance of the villain to the Batman mythos is just high sprouting from the first case Bruce Wayne ever investigated as a child and even plays on a lot of the paranoia of the character when the villains are ultimately unmasked. Also the fact that this comes right on the heels of Bruce trying to streamline his efforts to help Gotham make it something that will have lasting effects.<br />-The side characters are well done and are greatly represented in a brillaint note when Batman is trapped by the villains and left to rot in their trap. This leads to moments of despair and shows how this tension affects all aspects of Gotham crime fighting.<br />-The artwork is excellent, with Greg Capullo finding some really good high notes while keeping some memorable fight scenes and visuals. Particularly the hallucinations Bruce has in the villains's trap.<br /><br />Bad:<br />-While I like the side characters and their interactions, the feeling between Bruce and Nightwing isn't played up or when it does reach the point of issue #7, I don't really see a good reason for Bruce's action towards nightwing (he has moments of being a bastard, but Nightwing just takes it like he's still a kid.). There isn't much build up to it that wasn't 5 issue ago and their relationship wasn't that bad.<br /><br />Really it's just a minor grievance in the long run although I'm looking forward to seeing how everything ultimately resolves itself, all the threads. I'd definately recommend it despite that one part.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great hidden object game. Nice graphics.  Played well on my Kindle Fire.  Lots of hints and long story.Took a while to finish it. Hope more games like this are developed.

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I purposely forced myself to finish this horrid book JUST so that I could write a review. Beautiful Disaster should have never become a novel. It's like a long, drawn-out, novel-sized diary written by a 17 year-old girl with Daddy issues. The relationship centralized in this book is that of a sick and twisted fairytale where neither morals nor consequences for childish and erratic behavior exist, and there are no limits to how far a woman can be pushed. Travis and Abby are EXACTLY the type of relationship NO girl should want to have! There are forms of abuse that don't involve physical contact, and this coupling is the poster child for it.<br /><br />I digress; my outrage for the lack of character development and total misdirection of the idea of \\"love\\" aside, the errors in this book (grammatical and verbiage) are too ever present for me to ever take this writer seriously. Not one character, not even Abby, was relatable. There was no range of personality, being that every character had the temper of a toddler and each person resorted to violence and sex in order to solve any problem that arose (and let's face it, there were too many issues and problems to keep up).<br /><br />I will never suffer through another \\"book\\" written by Jamie McGuire again. All the 5-star reviews for this novel have me thinking that maybe I bought an entirely different book with the title Beautiful Disaster across the cover, because surely this, for lack of a better and more dignified word, \\"crap\\", could not have gotten such positive feedback. If I were Ms. McGuire, I'd be ashamed for ever having Beautiful Disaster published, and would think long and hard about having a few more life experiences (and English/creative writing/grammar courses) before ever writing a book again.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I love how sleek the case is-it fits easily in a back pocket. The only thing I would change is the auxiliary plug in...I just hate how I have to unscrew and worry about loosing the piece. Other then that it's perfect.
030758836X|5.0|There has been a huge split in how Gillian ended the book but I LOVED IT.I know it was great because a month later I'm still thinking about it. Sometimes life doesn't end with a perfect bow but the journey is so worth it and in this case it is as well. It was a brilliantly written well crafted story of a very broken couple. Flynn's First two books were brilliant and this MAY even be better. Bless you Gillian Flynn for proving that Stephanie Meyer is not the standard female writers aspire too. And that woman can write without being reminded on every page that it is obviously a woman writing it. Gillian Flynn is an Author not a female writer.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Fun game  to play. Plenty of quests monsters and things to do. Building is like legos you never have to take down. Fun to build and be imaginAtive. Website use required to share worlds and view others creations. The webpage politics leave a lot to be desired and as much as I love the game, a few people who love to cause trouble/drama ruin the webpage for me, which should be a fun place to discuss a game I enjoy with other enthusiasts.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I really love all the books of A song of Ice and Fire. However, I feel that since the 4th book that Martin is makeing us go on a mary go round with the plot and gets lost with characters that are not lovable or important. I love that we have the privalage to enter this world for a long time because Martin keeps on writing about it but I need it to go a little bit faster...<br /><br />Update<br />I justo finished reading the book and I really loved it! Can't wait for the 6th book to come out! But like a said before...I need a little bit more!! And Martin keeps on creating new characters, when we still have no idea what is happening to the original ones! Besides that it is an excelente book!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Create your own mix of sounds to fall asleep to. Even most of the musical selections are relaxing. Great app and well worth the price.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|It does what it says on the tin, with some pretty good story and character interaction. This book stands alone from being a \\"Guild Wars\\" book - I believe you'd enjoy it whether you like the source fiction or not.<br /><br />I'm not normally a fan of genre-splits; sometimes it works well (the first Tomb Raider movie) and sometimes it doesn't work at all (Max Payne, please step forward).  A lot of it seems to depend on writing, and by grabbing people like Jeff Grubb to come along for the ride on this one you've got yourself a story.<br /><br />Sure, there are criticisms.  The romance threads in here could be better.  I'm not sure if we're supposed to think the main character (a human) is falling for a Sylvari, or if he just really likes her.  The villains might be a bit transparent - the Asura especially - but overall they get the job done.<br /><br />Where I think the authors do a great job is in the storming, forming, norming, performing cycle of the group on their quest.  It's clear they're not built to get along, with racial tensions and long standing feuds.  How they overcome that is very well done in my view, not heavy-handed, and it's entirely believable who's left standing at the end and why they supported each other.
B00026WU3M|5.0|While not his most celebrated record, this 1989 album from Bob Dylan is a really good collection of songs combined with unique production work from Daniel Lanois, who is known for his work with U2. The atmospheric guitar and even harmonica sounds give it a different feel then most Dylan records. It was praised as a comeback for him after records like Infidels (1983), which I think is an underrated album in its own right. Not a bad song to be found here but my personal favorite is \\"Most Of The Time\\". Lanois would return to produce Dylan's 1997 grammy award winning album, Time Out Of Mind.
B000TGJ8A8|4.0|I enjoy watching both Nicholas Cage and Julianne Moore.  That said, this is a gem of a movie for one reason, imho:  there is some thought behind it in a day and age when most films are derivative at best and completely mindless and pointless at worst.<br /><br />Others here have divulged the basic plot and analyzed it, so I shall not re-hash.  What knocks my socks off every time I see this movie is the last line of the film -- delivered by Cage:  \\"Here's the thing about the future.  Every time you look at it, it changes.  And THAT changes everything else\\".  This is deep, metaphysical, quantum mechanics, almost Buddhist wisdom from a Hollywood product -- something so rare these days.  The statement can be taken on several levels, therefore it is complex and left to the discretion of the viewer.  Thank you writers, actors, and producers!  It is metaphorical, and can apply in anyone's life, whether they be a \\"prophet\\" or not.
B006J420UE|5.0|I decided to build a HTPC that could even do some gaming and felt this was the perfect product for that.  I'm very happy with it.  My build consists of:<br /><br />AMD A8-3870K APU<br />Kingston Hyper X Plug n Play 4 GB (2x2GB Modules) 1866MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL11 Desktop Memory (KHX1866C11D3P1K2/4G)<br />ASRock A55M-HVS FM1 AMD A55 FCH Micro ATX AMD Motherboard<br />Diablotek 380W microATX power supply<br />An old Western Digital 500 GB hard drive I had laying around<br /><br />I have installed Windows 8 RC on this PC and the installation was painless and quick, every driver was installed correctly but I still downloaded Catalyst Control Center from AMD's website for this APU (they have Windows 8 version).  Windows boots up very quickly and so far the system is stable.  I am even able to play Champions Online on high settings at 720p which is perfect for playing on my 32 inch TV while sitting on the couch.  I'm not a huge PC gamer, the only games I typically play on my main PC are some MMO's like Champions Online and even those I don't play religiously. It is however nice to know this can handle some of these games if I decide to play them.  For comparison, the Windows Experience Index of my system is as follows:<br /><br />CPU: 7.3<br />Memory 5.9 (I was expecting much higher since I have it running at 1866 MHz, but its possibly because I only have 4 GBs, or because this memory has 11 timing as opposed to 9 of the more expensive ones)<br />Graphics: 6.6<br />Gaming Graphics: 6.6<br />Hard Drive: 5.9<br /><br />Anyway, overall I'm very happy that I was able to build such a good system for around $250.

B0080N6BQQ|3.0|To be brief, I, like most Supernatural fans, have been grievously disappointed in Season 7. And for what I paid for it, triply so.  From what I read, though, Season 8 (Oct 3, 2012?) should make up for it. Bye bye Sera Gamble.

B004P73M22|1.0|Take my advice and do NOT buy this version of RTL. It may be halfspeed mastered and on 180 gram vinyl at 45 speed but that is no guarantee that it will sound good. The craze of vinyl has overwhelmed the companies that produce these records. First, the copy I got is warped. Couple that with the 45 speed and my tone arm jumps off one of the records. Only if I apply about 8 grams to it will it play, and I'm not doing that. But it's the quality of sound that just sucks. I see a lot of revues that say this album sounds great and either these people have really bad ears, really bad equipment that they think is good or worse yet, both. I have the original 'Megaforce\\" pressing of this album and I promise you will never find a better sounding copy anywhere. Even the printing of the sleeve is far superior to any other pressing. These can still be had for very near the price of the halfspeed mastered or maybe a lttle more. If you want the original sound, seek out and buy a 'MINT\\" or \\"NM\\" \\"Megaforce\\" pressing Ride the lightning. It will have the number \\"MRI 769\\" on the spine and on the back. This is how you can tell you have the original. Not only will you have the best recording in your hands, you will also own a piece of history in your hands, instead of a piece of crap. Even if you can't find one of these, find a original \\"Electra\\" copy and the quality will still be far better than all the rest. They are not too cheap either but worth every penny over the newer version on cheap vinyl. But don't just take my word on it, see what others are saying and save your money for the good stuff.<br /><br />[...]
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I loved the first season of Breaking Bad, but I have to admit, I wasn't hooked.  By the end of the second season, I was so hooked I couldn't contain myself!  Breaking Bad is a quiet low key show that packs a wallop.  Everything is quiet on the show including the sound, the people and the addictions.  The show is not held up by loud music but gentle sounds.  A kid shoots a drug dealer, a teddy bear is inexplicably immersed in water, two bodies are in body bags in a drive way, the images are compelling and the noise is soft.  Our protagonist is Walter White, a high school Chemistry teacher with a sterling reputation.  He has lung cancer which is terminal and gets into dealing meth to make money for his family after he is gone.  In this season, his wife is unexpectedly pregnant after years of infertility.  His son is in high school and Walt has mixed feelings about him because of his cerebral palsy.  Walt has been making money to get treatments for his cancer and appears to have taken a turn for the better.  Questions are being asked by his wife about the money and a possible 2nd cell phone which appears after Walt disappears in a fugue state and is found naked in a grocery store.  The story the series tells in season 2 is of a man who is getting more into drug dealing and making money from it while his original reason is fading and less important.  An advantage of watching the DVD is having access to the commentary which is fascinating and involving.  Deleted scenes and short documentary for most episodes are included.  All are worthwhile.  Enjoy this show.  You will be stunned by the finale.
B004AUGJS8|4.0|It starts off rather slow then in a moment it turns. The further along the movie goes the better it is- a great date movie that will spark conversation.
B00005N5RM|5.0|This movie has plenty of special effects of the blob dissolving people it comes across. A space mission carrying a biological germ warfare test comes back to earth. It carries the results of this test which is the blob. I found the movie to be interesting. I recommend this movie for the special effects alone, plus the plot.  It has plenty of people being bent into all kinds of shapes as they are captured by the blob.

030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  I found it a slow read, not a page turner, but overall not a bad story, it just seemed to take forever for the plot to evolve.  Well written, detailed, perhaps too much detail!

B007N85ZXY|4.0|This album was quite a nice surprise. I knew all the lyrics to all of these old folk songs, but all new arragements by the master Neil Young.  If you like 'garage bands' - you'll love it; if you hate 'garage bands', then you'll hate it.  But it's the REAL DEAL - no fake electronic junk.  Neil recorded this using all analog equipment too: a tube mixer and recorded onto analog tape (8 tracks), then mixed down to the digital two track for release.  This is what a real live garage band sounds like, and I love it.  Not quite 5 stars, but a good 4 stars.  Wish the vinyl version was less expensive, as I would love to have this on an real LP.  Well worth the money on CD.  Only complaint - us baby boomers can't read the tiny tiny text in the book with the lyrics and notes about the music's authors.  Neil Young still puts out good music and rocks with the best of us without anything phony about this release.  Long may you run!

B008XG1X18|1.0|Would love this app-if I could sign in! I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app, and it still won't load my info. It directs to FB at first, then back to Pinterest and acts like its loading. Never got passed that. I guess I'm the only one who's encountered this? oh well
B0083SBJXS|5.0|With Avengers Marvel had a tough row to hoe. Starting with Iron man, they cranked out a series of surprisingly watchable movies (including a remake of Ang Lee's disastrous Hulk) related by nothing more than a shared universe. Of course anybody who stayed through the credits of Iron Man knew an Avengers film was coming, but how would it blend the disparate themes and directorial styles of all the entries in the Marvel cinematic universe? Well, with Avengers, that uncertainty is over, and the results are fantastic.<br /><br />Avengers succeeds on three levels. Firstly, it allows every hero to behave as we expect them to. Iron Man is still a snarky always-knows-best alpha, Thor literally seems to have walked right out of his job in Asgard from his own film (and in the plot, he has) and Captain America is still reeling from his jaunt through time- but not enough to be scared of thousand-foot drops or flapped by Loki's supernatural mischief.<br /><br />Secondly, Avengers dumps all the characters we have come to know together in a big stew and Director Joss Whedon uses his flair for writing arguments (and comic books) to deliver every bit of the conflict and comradery you would expect. Heroes fight, team up, fight some more, then fight other stuff and every bit of it is punchy and fresh. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, tragically underdeveloped characters who only visited in past films have good, well-rounded personae here.<br /><br />And finally, Avengers is fun. The plot (Loki, the Norse god of mischief, dupes a race of alien cyborgs into invading Earth because he is MAD AT EARTH) is pure comic book cheese, with a suitably over-the-top climax (where the Hulk really shines). the dialog is clever and humorous and dark when it needs to be. The effects are outstanding, and a surprising amount of what you will see here is in fact sets and actors, just as in Captain America.<br /><br />There are some problems. The post-production 3D, for instance, is horrible- not because it isbadly implemented, but because this film makes use of a lot of creative camera perspectives that just look wrong with 3D applied to them- in the opening chase sequence, the helicopter following the convoy looks like an undersized toy due to the combination of a compressed perspective and a normal 3D field of depth. The film is also a bit inaccessible to viewers who haven't seen the preceding movies. After all, it wouldn't do to got through every hero's origin story whenever they show up. But these are minor quibbles, and shouldn't get in the way of enjoying what is one of the best, most satisfying comic book movies ever made, and a good omen of what's to come from this franchise.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Punchy writing<br />-Great effects, great action, and tons of both<br />-Good acting by principles and supporting cast alike<br />-Tons of little nods to comic book fans throughout<br />-Is almost three hours long, goes by like the world's best Saturday morning cartoon<br /><br />CONS:<br />-What the 3D editors did doesn't always match what the camera crew did<br />-CONSTANT Acura product placement that makes GM's endorsement of the Transformers films seem subtle<br />-So dependent on seeing the past films and blink-and-you'll-miss-it plot turns that it almost totally defies casual viewing

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a very exciting book that kept me reading almost straight through (aside from sleeping and eating).  However, it was short enough that I could be obsessed with it while not sacrificing too much of my life.  Good balance overall.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I enjoyed the series - the characters were interesting and the story moved along. Just wanted to be able to watch with no commercials!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|This movie has been sitting on my shelf for longer than it should have been before I finally picked it up one night and put it into the DVD player.<br /><br />I think we all pretty much know the premise of the movie now, right? Marilyn, played by Michelle Williams, goes to make a movie with Laurence Olivier in England. Colin Clark, a man in his early twenties from a rich family, dreams of being in the movie-making business and lands a job working with Laurence Olivier. As the movie films, Marilyn is unsure of herself as she tries to be a real actress and has the potential to ruin the film. As Colin spends time with Marilyn, he sees glimpses of the real girl behind the blonde bombshell veneer and that life is not perfect for her, the story of which, is well-known.<br /><br />I think that Michelle did a wonderful job as Marilyn. You can tell that she must have studied hours and hours of film to get Marilyn's mannerisms and speech patterns right. I sometimes forgot that I was watching an actress playing Marilyn Monroe. Judi Dench was perfect, as usual, as Dame Sybil Thorndyke. I liked that they gave a good supporter of Marilyn besides Colin. I kind of wish that she was in the film more. Kenneth Branagh was quite amazing as Kenneth Branagh. He did so well in the role. On the other hand, I completely disagree with the choice of Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh. As a huge fan of Ms. Leigh's, I couldn't really see any facial resemblance or voice resemblance between the two. There had to have been a better actress to play that role. That part was rather distracting and took me out of the film slightly.<br /><br />I really liked the movie. It was beautifully filmed as well. I'd definitely recommed having it on your list of movies to see.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I'm not gonna write a bloody novel like some of these people on here.  All I'm gonna say is that this cd has not left my car in the entire week I've have owned it and have listened to it every day!  Ever put a cd in and immediately it takes you by storm and you instantly love it and gives you that feeling of excitement?  This is it.  This is my audio orgasm.  All this is is taking The Legacy and Low, mashing them together and quite a few more years of talent and this is what you have.  Killer thrash that is tight, brutal, rockin, thrashin and has very entertaining songs.  GET IT!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|easy at first, but not boring to me. it really fun in my opinion!! ... word. word. word. word. word
B005RDF2RG|5.0|I rented this movie so my kids could watch a movie in a long flight.  They love this movie anyway so it was a huge hit.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|If you're a child of the 60's...... who doesn't love the Doors.  I used to have this in an LP, now I have it in CD format.
B000Q6GXW2|4.0|300 is a very entertaining movie. Its battle scenes involve modern techniques, with CGI and eye popping effects. The movie itself is recommended for a fun two hours. Don't expect any thought-provoking concepts or historical accuracy.<br /><br />The HD DVD contains a good copy of the film. I hadn't noticed any glaring flaws with the disc. The film contains much film grain, though I am sure that is from the film.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a absolutely fabulous game. I totally love all the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; series. Keep up the good work ya'll.
0307593525|5.0|If there is one thing I can say about this book--Mastering the Art of French Cooking--is that you learn from it not just French cooking but simply how to cook anything well. The instructions are very clear and are applicable to just about anything. The book is organized in a way to help one get a perspective of how French cooking is done in general and how certain techniques are applied again and again to prepare different recipes. For instance, the book has an extensive chapter on sauces. It is divided into sections by sauce type--meaning the basic sauce preparation procedure, only that ingredients are added to make a different kind. So, you will realize that making hollandaise and b&eacute;arnaise are essentially the same. The chapter on sauces already make the books worthwhile reading. You'd already go a long way into preparing wonderful French dishes if you learn to do these sauces, especially if you do mainly grilling or poaching with minimal flavorings.<br /><br />It is also very good that the authors anticipated the needs of the amateur or novice cook. As a result, volume 1 has very useful chapters on measurements and conversions, and on basic knife skills. I just find it strange though that the appendix on kitchen equipment is found in volume 2.<br /><br />It is one of those recipe books that are very educational and entertaining. It is also loaded with recipes, more than 500 I think in each volume.<br /><br />I highly recommend though that one also purchase Julia Child's video, The Way to Cook. Many of the cooking techniques discussed in the books are demonstrated here sans the detailed explanations.
B0085YNML2|5.0|This game is addicting and cute with really crisp graphics. My kids and I were cracking up as we played it! Well worth the money. One of my favorite apps. I'm sure I'll be playing this a lot!!
0307913147|5.0|If you are a pop culture nerd, you're gonna love this book.  If you're a gamer, you're going to love this book.  If your house is full of classic video games (but why do they never talk about pinball???), you're going to love this.  I'm going to admit that there is definitely the cheese factor that comes with all of these topics, especially when you figure that the WHOLE book is constantly discussing these topics.  BUT, in the middle of all of that, is a good story and characters that you are rooting for - others you are rooting against.  I'd characterize it as more of a Young Adult book, but because of the 70s-80s-90s pop culture at the core of the story, it's odd because those topics are more geared towards adults in their 30s-50s.  So, it's a little odd, but I did not care because it was fun.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version which was narrated by Wil Wheaton.  That was hilarious, because of course Wil Wheaton is talked about in the story.  Funny stuff, but he did a great job on the narrative.<br /><br />I loved it.  I want everyone to read it and have already recommended it to my friends and family and even mailed a copy to my brother before I even finished it!
B000003TAW|4.0|I've been listening to tracks from this album recently and realized I had to write a review.  This was one of the first albums I owned largely due to the track \\"Buddy Holly\\".  I enjoyed that track, but it wasn't until later that I really started to appreciate the other songs.<br /><br />I have years of formal education in music, played in various bands in high school, and continue to appreciate and at times perform.  I hung around with other guys in high school band who had more training than I did in music and thus became still a stronger musician through their influence.<br /><br />I say all that to say this: Weezer's first album is a musical masterpiece.  Granted, not all the songs are my favorite, but I have to respect what they've done.  This album has stood the test of time and still stands up today.<br /><br />I think what makes it such a great album is that you generally don't get lost in the lyrics, they are for the most part light, unique, and feel-good.  In fact, I would generally use that term to describe this album: feel-good.  I don't see how anyone can walk away from most of the tracks on this album without out feeling good.<br /><br />Aside from the lyrics, the vocals are excellent with harmonies at times reminiscent of the 'beach boys'.  I enjoy Rivers' vocals on this album more than his more recent delivery style (green album and on).  The vocals are more purer than now, and thus (in my opinion) unpolluted.<br /><br />The drums, electric guitars, harmonica, and bass are all very creative and the mix of sound with vocals is stellar.  I think that every true musician would appreciate and respect this album.<br /><br />As if I can't say enough, I really enjoy Weezer's signature deep distorted electric guitar that cranks the rhythm parts.  The guitar solos are sensational, the drums are moving and exceptional, and the bass actually has stand-out and solo parts which are refreshing.<br /><br />This album is also ingenious.  Aside from most songs that are very strict, you have tracks like \\"Surf Wax America\\", and \\"Holiday\\" that have total change of gears in the middle, and them come back stronger to finish up.  This album definitely plays with volume dynamics which is sadly missing from most music.<br /><br />To sum up, I think this album is perhaps best defined as being \\"Beach Boys\\" meets hard rock.  Thus yielding a modern, feel-good album.<br /><br />The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I wasn't crazy about all the lyrics.<br /><br />With this album, Weezer wrote the book on how to produce a time-less and very listenable album.<br /><br />As a side note:<br />It's sad to me that Weezer couldn't (or wouldn't) produce another album quite as good as this.  Pinkerton was still musically strong, but the lyrics (I felt) got in the way of the feel-good aspect of the first album.  Since Pinkerton, there has been a very strong departing from this first album in terms of lyrical style and musicianship.  Weezer today sounds too polished as if they have abandoned their sense of creativity so well demonstrated on this first album.<br /><br />Still, they did provide us with a great album that I believe will be a classic for years to come.
0307970299|5.0|Wow.  I have to say I was surprised how many people didn't like this book, because I loved it.  I've been really enjoying memoir style books lately and had never even heard of this when I picked it up.  It called to me because I, too, once felt called to hike the PCT and in the midst of my preparations some life changes came along and changed that and it never happened.  When I started listening to this book, I felt sad that I never did that and I am now inspired to start doing pieces of the trail myself along with my husband.  Thank you, Cheryl Strayed!<br /><br />But, besides the adventurous piece of a solo woman hiking the PCT, the story was really about her and the grief she suffered after her mother's death and the horrible decisions and choices she made and having to come to grips with all of it.  I found it to be moving.  I cried in parts of it and I agree with some that some of the sex detail probably was unnecessary, but that was such a small part of the story that it in no way took away from everything else that happened.  I loved reading about the people she met on her journey and just the whole experience of it all.  I'd never heard of Cheryl Strayed, but I will definitely look into her novel because I found her writing style to be very engaging.<br /><br />Loved the book and I'm already recommending it to friends!
B000OP1M6M|5.0|A friend of mine got me all excited about mechanical watches and I always kind of wanted a nice Seiko anyway - my search quickly led me to this one:  The Seiko \\"Pepsi Diver\\" (Seiko doesn't name their watches, but the names the enthusiasts come up with tend to stick).<br /><br />I have a dive computer that I use for my actual scuba diving, but this might make a nice backup.  It's got a rotating bezel that you can twist to point at the minute hand - and then you can easily glance at it and see how many minutes it's been since you set the bezel (it only rotates counter-clockwise.  I guess that's so that bumping it accidentally during a dive might make it look like you've been down longer than you have - but it can't make it look like you've been down less time, so it errs on the side of diver safety)<br /><br />Here's a crash course in the things I've learned about mechanical watches and this watch in particular:<br />1) This is an \\"automatic\\" watch - which means self-winding.  There is a small weight inside the watch that swivels around as you move during the day and keeps the watch wound for you.<br />2) If you take it off and leave it for too long, it will run down and you'll have to rock it back and forth a bit to get it going again.  I haven't let mine run down yet so I don't know how long it takes.  It will certainly stay running overnight if you take it off when you go to bed.<br />3) The guts of mechanical watches are called the \\"movement\\".  This is a Japanese movement, model number 7S26.  Seiko has been using this movement for a long time and it works very well.<br />4) You'll see mechanical watches talk about how many \\"jewels\\" they have.  These aren't for bling - they aren't even visible unless you get a watch where you can see the insides.  I's referring to the small industrial rubies that are used as low friction bearings in the movement.  I think 19 is pretty standard, plus a couple extra that are used in the self-winding stuff - this is a 21 jewel movement.<br />5) Some people complain that the watch isn't as blue as they expected.  The face of it is more like a dark bluish gray - but the bezel is a nice blue, and between the two of them it's blue enough for me<br />6) I bought the SKX009K2 model.  As far as I can tell from internet research, it is exactly the same as the SKX175 model - the 175 is just intended for the American market and is a bit more expensive for some reason.<br />7) It has day/date wheels on it - so it will show THU 16, FRI 17 etc.  The day/date wheels appear to be white plastic. The text is all black except for SAT, which is blue, and SUN, which is red.  The day wheel is also bilingual, with abbreviations for spanish days of the week on it as well.  They alternate with each other - so the wheel has \\"MON LUN TUE MAR WED MIE THU JUE FRI VIE SAT SAB SUN DOM\\" on it.  When you set it, you just pick whichever language you prefer.  Then when it changes at midnight it moves two clicks to get to the next day in the language you selected.  It doesn't move those two clicks instantly, though.  The day of the month starts changing before midnight.  The day of the week starts changing sometime after midnight, then it changes to the spanish version of the day, and then sometime around 3am it finishes changing to the english version of the correct day<br />8) The face of the watch (officially called the \\"crystal\\") is made from Seiko's brand of hardened glass called hardlex<br />9) Mechanical watches don't tend to be as accurate as quartz watches, though if you think about how little time it gains or loses in a day while you're walking around banging it into doorframes it's really an incredibly precise machine.  Mine is currently gaining about 2 seconds per day when worn 24/7.  It gains time faster if I take it off - partially because watches run fastest when they're on their face or back as they are when you set them down.  I think it also has something to do with temperpature stability.  When you're wearing it, it's pretty much always at your skin temperature.  I think they tend to run faster when they are new and they wear in and slow down a bit after a couple months.<br />10) The movement is supposed to move 21600 times per hour on this watch, which is 6 times per second.  You can see the second hand moving multiple times per second, but it looks like it only moves 5 times per second to me - so I'm not sure about that part of it.<br />11) Watches come with extra links in the band - so you won't be able to take it out of the box and put it on unless you have really big wrists.  You need a tiny little punch to drive out the link pins - I just took it to a watch store and they fitted it for me for ten bucks<br />12) Seiko is apparently known for really bright \\"lume\\" (glow in the dark).  If this is in the sun for a minute or so and you take it inside it glows like crazy.  It doesn't stay that way for long, but that's pretty normal.  If you wake up in the middle of the night and look at it the hands are very dim, but are sill visible.<br /><br />Anyway, overall this is a really cool watch with some significant Seiko Diver history behind it and some amazing mechanical stuff in there.  I'm very happy I bought it.  The price and shipping from the Amazon partner company were excellent.  It did come with a warranty card and was new-in-box.

B002OSXDAU|2.0|There were 3 instances in which I'd heard about \\"The Fountainhead\\". I decided to purchase the 3rd time. Although the characters were well developed I found myself skipping and or skimming large portions of the book.  The long conversations were not holding my interest at all and 3/4 through the book I found myself wondering what was the purpose. As far as I'm concerned, this book is seriously overrated.
0307956350|4.0|Want to dive into a book for pure fun? Need a beach or pool read?<br />Something on the plane that doesn't put you to sleep with it's eloquent but heavy prose?  This might be the one for you.<br /><br />Our entire book club found The Expats to be enjoyable summer fare, a little bit travelogue, a lot spy/detective novel, tossed in with some thrilling moments and an ending that...well, I actually wrote the author for an answer to one of our questions.<br />(And he gave it to me! - see end of review... I'll share if you ask)<br /><br />How nice is that? To have someone who replies to their fans and cares?<br /><br />I give it an honest four stars for its engaging style and effort, although not five stars, because it wasn't THAT epic.<br /><br />It possesses a \\"Memento\\" (the movie) style narrative which keeps the reader off balance in a good way. I also fondly recalled \\"True Lies.\\"  Please note the dates and times of the chapters,  because they matter. Hard copy readers have an advantage as the typeface is different. Kindle readers will have to carefully observe the chapter headings.<br /><br /> Mr. Pavone has a budding series and engaging character in Kate, the ex Cia agent who thinks she's the only one who keeps secrets.<br /><br />  There aren't stock discussion questions so I put together some of my own, again keeping it light and fun.  We didn't want to think too hard, although there is a rather tangled plot at the heart of the story.<br /><br />  I always start my group with libations and a pop quiz. What is the capital of Luxembourg? What city has Kate never visited?<br /><br />  We all enjoyed the city descriptions and atmosphere. It's like a James Bond movie: did she really need to go to THAT place, but wasn't it fun that she did? Kate snoops around the continent to solve her mystery, complete with break-ins, red herrings, and a girl fight I didn't quite swallow.<br /><br />  Keeping with the fun, we chose our favorite actors to play Kate, Dexter, Bill, and Julia.  For Kate, our first gut instinct was Angelina Jolie who does that spy-girl thing so well. But Jennifer Garner (Ms. \\"Alias\\" herself) would also work. Dexter might be nerdy, but we wanted Matt Damon ala \\"Ripley.\\"  Bill the Lothario was trickier - he had to be oily and attractive. Eric Bana? Peter Facinelli?<br /><br /> But there was NO problem casting the ethereal Julia. Thin, beautiful, fair, patrician: Gwyneth Paltrow!<br /><br /> Of course, putting Angelina and Gwyneth in the same movie might not sit well with them (Brad Pitt being their common denominator). Girl fight!<br /><br />  We had a debate about something that happens at the end, so I took it up with the author who was more than happy to set me straight. No, I'm not revealing it here! (But if you leave me a comment, I'll tell you).<br /><br />  Okay, Chris, you've made a start, so keep it going. Leslie.
B004LGPBZI|4.0|Being a huge Oasis fan, I was very interested to hear this record. I think that the album has to be seen through the lens of what was going on at the time with the Lads.<br /><br />Noel quit and Liam, Gem, Chris and Andy decided to keep on as a group. The album sounds really great. Because the boys jumped right back in it, it seems that the songs kicking around were not in huge supply.<br /><br /> There are some great ones on this record for me. Namely, \\"Four letter word\\", \\"The Roller \\" \\"Standing on the Edge of the noise\\" and the bench mark - \\"Beat goes on\\". These are truly great tunes and Liam sounds great. The other tunes are clever and well played but weak as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Liam says that the songs on the 2nd Beady Eye record will be much better. Perhaps they have a sense of the filler on the record too.<br /><br />But I remain a huge fan of the boys in Beady Eye. They are the cool of the cool. For sure worth buying.

B006RUJST6|4.0|Very interesting view of young adults doing the right thing. I found that this book was well written and it did hold my attention.
0061438294|5.0|This guy has an amazing history and TV shows have only now (2012) picked up on it with shows like The Mentalist and Lie to Me (cancelled, unfortunately but a great show illustrating these things)...Even if you are not a professional you can use even the small things. He states it will help you realize where people are coming from, how to get into rappor with someone and see them mimic your moves to confirm that, what a body says when it turns in different positions as you converse...really interesting. As a physician I find this stuff invaluable to be sure my patients are listening and UNDERSTANDING me. If they turn their chests a bit to the side they are relaxed; if they get confrontational with body language even when they are smiling at me--I know to back off, they are not understanding me.<br /><br />So I highly rec. this book. No matter what you do, it wil help YOU communicate with others and be able to recognize and appreciate their subtle responses that MANY times are NOT what they are telling you with their words!<br /><br />Highly recomended. *****
B007SGM084|5.0|OMG!! These books are fantastic! I couldn't put them down. The characters will grab you from the very beginning, I just loved reading them and I will re-read them over and over!
1601251831|5.0|The Pathfinder:  Bestiary is just as good if not better than the original D&D 3.5 Monster Manual.  Additional appendices help the GM craft well-balanced encounters (even if the sheer nerdiness of his efforts guarantees his virginity for life).

B007SGM084|1.0|Not opposed in the least to stimulating erotica that is well written, no matter the fetish...the key being well-written.  Definitely teenage fantasy for the Twilight starved set.  Don't waste your time. Tried to give it NO star, but Amazon wouldn't let me.
0547569653|5.0|Without question, Scott Jurek is an inspiring and compelling athlete:  he runs far, fast, and has a novel life story.  But the Scott Jurek presented in various articles, interviews, blogs, and other people's books can't *really* capture who Jurek is so I was pleased to see him write his own book about his story, told from his perspective.  And his story doesn't disappoint:  his difficult and abbreviated childhood, his years of self-doubt, his commitment to running and winning, his need to push his body and mind to their absolute limits, the loss of his mother, and the eventual re-realization of why he runs.  Embedded in his story, however, are some colorful and memorable characters --- Dusty Olson, his childhood friend, being the most amusing of the lot.  As Scott acknowledges in the book, who he is today and what he went on to accomplish may not have been possible without Dusty and even if it had, it wouldn't have been nearly as colorful (as evidenced by Dusty's remark that Jurek doesn't have a chance of winning a race as long as he's lying around in the dirt).  Whether you are reading this book for the running, the eating, or both, you won't be disappointed.
034580404X|3.0|Besides the witty comments and the few laughs...generally it is an ok book, but very stereotypical. Buying the books I already would know they would be cupcakey in comparison to other books I have read...and guess what they ARE! Was Ana locked up in a box to not even know what is out there. We do live in the 21st century to easily have access to information. The author does not know anything about technology? There is no such thing as a 1.5T hard drive and a 32G RAM (pg 178, 1st book) MacBook or Windows, etc. Even if someone made one with 32G RAM it would be rendered pretty much useless. First off MacBooks only have upgradable RAM to 8G (as of current), hard drives (internal or external) go from 1T and then jump to 2T (there is no such thing as a 1.5) If you did have a 32G of RAM it would be a custom built server. Definitely not a laptop. They just don't make it! People should learn what they are talking about and not throw numbers at a wall. I am sure others who understand current tech would be appalled as well.<br /><br />If you want to an impeccable read try Anne Rice The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy, mini stories from The Iron Gate.com, Master/Slave: 30 Spanking Tales from the Top & 30 Stinging Tales from the Bottom edited by N.T Morley, Alison's Wonderland by Alison Tyler or a Rachel Krammer Brussel book to name but a few in my library of erotica.<br /><br />If they do make a movie; Kristen Stewart would just ruin it as Ana Steele. We don't need to make another twilight series...a woman such as Amanda Seyfield (sweet look with some added seduction) is what would be needed. With dyed hair of course ;3 As for Christian Grey someone with a strong, but not to boyish look would be suitable..Ian Somerhalder, Matt Bomer, Chris Hemsworth, or Jonathan Rhys Meyers would be my choices. A look that could potentially command a room. The movie would probably be as cupcakey as the book though. So, my hopes are not set on it. The MPAA would just cut out all the scenes to tone themdown. LOL.<br /><br />Overall, 3 stars (ok rating) possible a 2 star. There is a ton more books out there to learn about the M/s dynamic and far more salacious stories for hungry appetites.
1400069289|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  The only thing about it that doesn't work for me is how the real-life stories used to illustrate the concepts are sometimes \\"chopped up\\", presented in pieces and interspersed with other stories or other material (I sometimes lost track of a particular story).  But overall it makes a lot of sense to me and I'm finding it very helpful as I work on making some changes in my life.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|NOTE: I received this eARC from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I LOVED \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" from cover to cover. It was a total emotional roller coaster that left me in a state of stupor for hours. I was a complete wreck, not knowing whether to cry or laugh in hysterics.<br /><br />I only have one suggestion to make though.... \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is in no way a YOUNG ADULT book. It's very much an ADULT book, even though the main character is a 19-year old girl. There were lots of expletives, there were several sex scenes... you get the idea. So no, I wouldn't recommend this book to a teenager.<br /><br />But, nonetheless, it was amazing. It was one of the books that I truly enjoyed reading this year, and I'm even going to place it in a to re-read folder.<br /><br />The story itself was pretty unique, though the bad boy-good girl concept still remains. Who doesn't love a bad boy though? And most importantly - who doesn't love a bad boy who learns his lesson? I sure do.<br /><br />It's a fast paced story with a really strong character presence. I honestly felt like I was in there, right in Abby's head, living the whole episode with her. And believe me, it was an amazing experience that rocked my world! I couldn't put the book down, even dreaming about it. And no, not because I was in love or obsessed with Travis. It was because the story truly moved me.<br /><br />So, what is the story about? It's about a girl who falls for the wrong guy, who falls for the right girl. I.e. they fall for each other, but their take on the situation is pretty different. Here's why: Abby has had a difficult past, where her father used her as a lucky charm in his gambling, until one day... snap! It was all over. And since then he hated her and abused her verbally. Her mom was a drunk, of whom nobody really wanted to talk about.<br /><br />Abby's only way out of home was escape to college. Where, of course, she met Travis. And Travis was bad news. I mean REALLY REALLY bad news. The toe-curling, mind-boggling kind of bad news that throws you on your back and takes your breath away. Not only that, but Travis has his own demons to fight, and most of the time, he just gives in to them. That is, until Abby.<br /><br />They are each other's weakness. They are each other's strength. Each can live without the other, but that isn't what I'd call life.<br /><br />All the struggles they went through, the jealousy, the fighting, the total disaster that resulted in their broken hearts... all of that was the grand prelude to something so cheesy and beautiful, I can't even describe it. The developmental stages of their relationship brought me up and then pulled me back down until I was such an emotional wreck, I couldn't recognize myself.<br /><br />And of course, it wasn't completely about Abby and Travis all the time. There were other characters that make appearance. Like Abby's best friend, America, who would kill anyone that threatens Abby's happiness and peace of mind. And Travis's cousin, Shepley, who endured all the mood swings with great patience. Travis's brothers and father, who really made me love them.<br /><br />Which means that all the ingredients for an incredible story are there: nice plot, realistic characters and great story pacing.<br /><br />So, what can I say in conclusion? If you enjoyed Pushing the Limits by Katie McGarry, you'd definitely enjoy Beautiful Disaster.

B0089J270U|5.0|I read the review of the person who bought this film on blu ray and could not get it to work. I really wanted this movie on blu ray but thought twice about it. I went and bought it from the same retailer as the other person for 2 reasons. 1- I could return it easy if there was a problem and, 2- It was much cheaper than here on amazon. I also have a Panasonic Blu ray bd210 and opened it right away to see if i would have the same problem. Good news is i did not -- pic and sound would good and load time seem about the same as other Blu rays. Im pretty sure that the other reviewer has either a bad disc or a picky Blu ray player. On a side note although i did see a difference in picture that was better somewhat--- The sound was so much better than the version on the DVD which for me made the Blu ray worth buying.

B005LAIHYU|1.0|Ridiculously stupid movie and it will be an even worse experience if you've read the book.  Having said that, let me just say that I absolutely LOVED the book!!  However, the entire storyline from the book was completely thrown out, and an entirely new (and awful) one created for this movie.  Is there anything from the book in the movie?  Yes, 2 things.  Abe Lincoln and Vampires.  Aside from that there is not one scene from the movie that is in the book.<br /><br />Even taking the story from the book out of my mind and just rating the movie on its own merits, it remains awful.  The entire storyline is just predictable and unimaginative, not to mention entirely unrealistic.  Now, I'm not saying that vampires and such are realistic.  When I say it've unrealistic, I mean the normal things happening in the movie.  Everything from leaping across the backs of stampeding of horses for miles to the climax of saving the union in the battle of gettysburg.  I would go into detail here, but if you haven't watched it and intend to, then I don't want to spoil it for you regardless of the stupidity.<br /><br />Additionally, they made it seem like the southern army led by Lee was nothing but evil, demons and vampires while the north was good and the best humanity had to offer.  I think if you live in the South you will probably be VERY upset watching this movie!!  FYI:  The book doesn't portray this, so in closing.... Read the book and don't waste your money on this crap-tastic movie.

B008B1VYP0|2.0|Much like the rest of the core of people who love the old M5, I am fairly disappointed with this album, outside of the hit Payphone which is probably one of their top 10 songs of mine. Just for a minute put anyone of these other songs up against Harder to Breathe, This Love, Wake Up Call, Makes Me Wonder, or Won't Go Home Without You. Enough said, you just can't compare the style of the two and how great their previous work is, compared to this glitzy, pop trash.<br /><br />Levine can sing, no doubt, and his voice makes this album bearable, but it is far from their best effort.
0525478817|3.0|From the very beginning of this book, sixteen-year-old Hazel states that this story is not the typical cancer story. \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is not about cancer; it is about enjoying the mere pleasure of being alive. I thought Hazel would fully embrace what this book is about. Instead, I was frustrated by Hazel's idea of seeing herself as a \\"side-effect\\" of life, rather than an active member of the world she lives in. Surprisingly, I preferred her friend and eventual lover, Augustus. Augustus was blunt and encouraged Hazel not to be ashamed of expressing how she felt about the people around her. Like him, Hazel did not know when her last day would be. Despite my discontent, I found it refreshing for Hazel and Augustus to express themselves so eloquently at all times.

B007FZ7R7W|5.0|This album is, yes, mainly about sexual encounters; but at the same time, that is Chris Brown. The bulk of his F.A.M.E album was all about sex as well.

I love the FORTUNE album and I love Chris Brown. He is amazing!

B007VDPE32|2.0|If I heard this flat out I would think it was just ok. But the fact that it was played up to be his first big mainstream pop record, my hopes were SO HIGH!! I LOVED some of his older poppier stuff and so when I heard this I was let down. His style is more moody, and it comes across even on the more upbeat songs. Pop singers smile when they record, you can hear it. I feel like that would have made a difference.. so I wish they didn't get my hopes up for mainstream pop, because this isn't mainstream pop.
0156012197|5.0|I read \\"The Little Prince\\" in my late 20's to early 30's. I am now 60 and there were more insights to be found the second time around. My 92 year-old mother asked to read it and she enjoyed it as well. It is ageless in it's rich impact at any age.<br />  One would think it was a children's book, but they would be wrong. In fact,I think it may be a little disturbing to young children since they would find it difficult to grasp the meanings behind many of the character's actions, such as death by a snake. Indeed,the first time I read this book, I could not grasp the wisdom behind many of the character's stories. However, some insights stuck with me throughout my life and became part of my vocabulary. When the Prince said that the Rose believed her thorns would protect her, that created a spark of understanding that helped me be more confident in my own thoughts and decisions about the actions of some people, including mine. It helped me be a better person without having to laboriously learn the \\"hard way.\\" It helped put me on \\"The Path\\" of my own introspection. I highly recommend this book to anyone to read over and over again throughout life.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The second season of the BBC's new Sherlock Holmes is even better than its first season.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are priceless and wildly entertaining as consulting detective Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson in 21st Century London.  This season's stories are extremely well executed riffs on Conan Doyle's familiar stories.  Supporting cast members Mrs. Hudson, Inspector Lestrade, and even poor Molly the lovesick forensics technician get good parts to play.<br /><br />The first episode is \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", a superb reimagining of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", in which Sherlock Holmes faces Irena Adler, \\"the woman\\", who in this version is a dominatrix.  This redo extends the story, and the relationship, in some interesting directions without sacrificing the delicious duel of wits between the two, including an excellent twist at the end.<br /><br />\\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" has the temerity to take on the legendary Sherlock Holmes story \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", and gets away with it, envisioning an updated and truly menacing threat for Holmes and Watson to face on Dartmoor. Even Sherlock will have his relentlessly rational mind rattled just a bit.<br /><br />\\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" is a redo of the Final Problem\\", placing the fatal duel between Holmes and Moriarty in a modern context with modern weapons, and an ending that will keep the viewer guessing to the credits.<br /><br />Production values for these episodes are excellent, with fascinating mixtures of venues and visual magic, including the portrayal of Holmes' skill at deduction in near real time.  This set includes a featurette on the making of the show.  There has to be a third season; very highly recommended.

0812993292|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a poignant, thought-provoking, and tremendously involving piece of work. Set in England, it's a powerful and inspirational story about love, friendship, mortality, and burning regrets. A story about faith, persistence, and opening oneself to the world and people around you. Confronting the ghosts of your past and mending broken - or almost broken - bonds with the people in your life. Above all, it's a deeply affecting tale of one man's journey - both physical as well as metaphysical - to say his final goodbyes to a once dear friend.<br /><br />  Harold Fry, a retired sales representative, receives a letter from his former co-worker and old friend, Queenie, in which she informs him that she's dying from cancer. Through tears, Harold scribbles a polite reply, in which he tells Queenie that he's deeply sorry about her situation. He then puts on his waterproof jacket and walks out the door, headed for the mailbox at the end of the road. Upon reaching the mailbox, he decides to walk to the next one, and then the next one, until he finds himself at the opposite side of the town. Hungry, he stops at a convenience store to grab a bite. There he meets a young girl who tells him about her sick aunt, and that when it comes to battling disease science is not everything, it's also - or perhaps most of all - important to have faith. Because \\"if you have faith, you can do anything\\". Inspired by these words, Harold makes up his mind to do something that he'd never normally do, he decides to walk to Queenie's sickbed, convinced that this will somehow help her survive, even if only for a little longer.<br /><br />\\"Tell her Harold Fry is on his way. All she has to do is wait. . . . I am going to save her, you see. I will keep walking and she must keep living. Will you say that? . . . Tell her this time I won't let her down.\\"<br /><br />  Harold is not much of a walker, his decision to walk six hundred miles from Kingsbridge to Berwick upon Tweed, is a spur-of-a-moment one. With no phone and no good walking shoes, he's utterly unprepared for the journey, yet he's armed with faith and determination, and he won't give up until he reaches his destination. He believes in the importance of his journey. As long as he keeps on walking, Queenie will keep on living, waiting for him to arrive. On his way he meets all sorts of people and passes through all sorts of places. With every step, he sees something he never saw (or paid attention to) before, and he learns something new about the world and himself. With plenty of time to think, he ponders his life, and his relationship with his wife and son. He recalls past conversations, events and other memorable moments that shaped his future. And with every eccentric person he encounters, every life-changing thought that pops into his head, Harold begins to see his life in a new light.<br /><br />  This book affected me in so many ways. It really got under my skin and made me stop and think about the plot, its meaning, as well as how it all relates to my own life. After all, we all carry the burden of mortality through our lives; and we all have things we regret, things we wish we'd done differently. Some sort of unfinished business that prevents us from moving on and being happy. This book is about all those things we regret doing (or NOT doing), saying (or NOT saying).. It's about those paths we never walked, places we never explored, thoughts we dared not to think.. and how they ultimately shaped our lives and the lives of people around us. Most importantly, though, this story shows us that it's never too late to take the first step and embark on a life-changing journey. As long as the clock keeps on ticking, and our hearts keep on beating, there is always hope. And you should never give up. It's a beautiful, uplifting message, and one I'll never forget.<br /><br />  The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is beautifully written, subtle, cathartic, hopeful and almost poetic. Honest and heart-felt, it's a profoundly meaningful story about a deeply spiritual journey. A journey that is even more important than the getting to the destination. Though it comes really close to being overly sentimental, even cheesy, Harold's pilgrimage is in fact modest, unpretentious and obviously well-intentioned. The long walk to Queenie proves to be very difficult, painful, and seemingly too much for his old, unprepared self, but at the same time it's also eye-opening, introspective, and - ultimately - rewarding. A serene experience that purifies and revitalizes both the heart and the soul.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough.tic.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|i admit that I read this out of curiosity and not because I'm a erotica fan. Maybe thats why I couldn't get into it, besides the unbearable writing. I understand that this is the debut work from this author, but how could it have made it to the bookshelves without an editor taking a look at it. I only assume an editor never looked at it because if they did, I can only hope they were fired sortly after the release, but based on the sales of this book, getting fired is highly unlikely. So onward we go, perpetuating more mediocrity. If you like erotica, give this book a shot. If you like good writing and good plot, avoid it. I rarely give bad reviews on books, but I had to make an exception with this one.

B0032W6PWK|4.0|I've actually seen this version in the theater back in the 70s. I wish the producers would have authored this version so it would fill the entire image area of our new 16 by 9 monitors as this version waws done in that format. Unfortunately, they authored it for old school 4 by 3 format. That means that when you watch this video on a 16 by 9 monitor, you're going to see a black apron all the way round the image area. That also means the resolution's going to be way lower than it should be. On a 4 by 3 monitor, you'll see the black bars at top and bottom. I sure hope this movie gets re-authored correctly so it can be seen properly.<br /><br />I've noticed this problem with a few other 16 by 9 movies that were authord for 4 by 3 formats.

B004XANKVO|3.0|I bought this backpack for school, hoping it was large enough to hold the heavy load of textbooks and notebooks that I carry everyday. The backpack is really well made, has tons of features and is HUGE. I could easily fit 5 notebooks, a MacBook and a change of clothes. In fact, I found it to be too large for a woman's frame. Also, I felt like there wasn't enough padding on the shoulders straps and I found that they cut into the sides of my neck. Ultimately, I ended up returning it. While its a very nice backpack, women should know it isnt really cut for their body type and could be severely uncomfortable.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|The wizards behind the making of this Blu0ray/DVD set did an amazing job at bring forth the best of the original Aristocats that my family just loves, while also providing so many great bonus features that I had never seen before. I have to say that I loved the addition of some of the songs that had been taken out of the original film as it provides some thought into the minds of the song writers which is something that I have always enjoyed. The movie is provided in vivid color and amazing sound and if your family is like mine you will be cranking up this great sound with the many tunes that will so easily get embedded in your mind throughout the film. This is a family classic that all should experience and enjoy!

0452289963|4.0|I'll make my review a duo for both the Author Eckhart Tolle and his latest book A New Earth. I read his first book `Power of Now' about 8 years ago and A New Earth about 1 month ago, and I didn't find too much difference between the two. Both are outstanding works written by an outstanding modern-day spiritual teacher. This latest book is a good read for both beginners and for people who have been meditating for many years. I've been around meditation and spiritual practices for a long time and still find Tolle to have an uncanny ability to place his finger on the breath of the issue: enlightenment Now. I enjoy his videos and talks as well.<br /><br />Though I appreciate his message, my biggest criticism of Tolle and this book is that he writes and speaks from a place of `end game' enlightenment. He gets right to the deepest descriptions of enlightened mind first and tends to skip over the part where a meditator actually has to sit down and do the work. I like that he tells a reader enlightenment is possible now, because it certainly is, and he certainly is an example of it, but he can sometimes oversimplify in his writing what is required to stay there. Anyone can experience `presence' for a moment or two, as Tolle points out, but to reverse 1000's of years of poor human conditioning from a mind that constantly flips past & future, to a mind that has made `presents' the predominant state requires vigorous attention, for an extended period. Tolle spent many years of his life developing his firm-state of mindfulness, and it shows in his presentation; and he spent many more years studying the many Buddhist practices that took him there. Tolle effectively points out over-and-over again how we must remove the many years of poor training in order to stay awake -- and points out just how deep ego can run -- but he never really gets around to telling people how to stay present for the long haul. He is all inspiration - and no perspiration.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I are both avid meditators, and we often talk about the above point as if it were the story of the fish and the fisherman. I'm not a big fan of this story because I'm a vegetarian, but you might see my point. As the saying goes, \\"If you give someone a fish -- you feed him for a day. But if you show someone how to catch fish, you feed him for a lifetime.\\" Eckhart Tolle not only gives you the fish, but he slices it up for you Sashimi style, serves it on a silver plate with wasabi and green tea on the side; he even offers to burp you when you're done.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book. And if you can somehow wake yourself up -- and you are still awake in a few years from now -- read it again. Because it's even better once you've spent some time there.<br /><br />--Marcus<br />Author of WAKE YOURSELF UPe both avid meditators, and we often talk about the above point as if it were the story of the fish and the fisherman.

1451627297|5.0|This was only my second King novel (after The Gunslinger) and it was one of the best books I have read in a while.  I was initially attracted to the book because I enjoy time travel stories/movies.  I bought it for a long plane flight and then stayed up late the next two nights to finish the 800+ pages.  The story is epic and there were several very long sub plots.  He does an excellent job of capturing what I would imagine this time period was like.  For me, the most compelling part of the book was not the race to stop one of the pivotal events in the last half-century, but the romance between the main character and Sadie.  The ups and downs of their relationship kept me racing through the last several hundred pages.  The climax was thrilling and the ending was indeed as poignant as described in the front pages.  And \\"I have never been what you'd call a crying man.\\"
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Sorry, but this book was one of the most boring books that I have ever read. Not only was it extremely badly written - I had the impression that the author is a BIG fan of Copy and Paste - but it was rubbish and the subject had not been researched at all. The pathetic little heroine never stopped biting her lip and murmuring Holy Crap or something to that effect. The two of them only interrupted their rutting for her to blush and drink exotic drinks like pink champagne and for him to press his ever-present sex up against her hip and smile cynically<br />I even skipped through Volume 2 because I thought it must get better - it's on the best seller list. Sorry everybody, we have been conned!
0691152640|3.0|This book was praised extravagantly when it was released in 2009, which was obviously perfect timing for an analysis of the history of financial crises, given that we were (and arguably still are) in the middle of a biggie. There has clearly been a huge amount of work involved in collating data on previous crises, which is a considerable achievement. However, the book is unsatisfying in many ways.<br /><br />Firstly, I'm not sure how much I learned from this book. I am reasonably historically literate and therefore did not find it surprising that sovereign default and financial crises have always been with us, although I suppose it is nice to have this confirmed and nicely summarized, and one clear lesson from the Financial Crisis is that most people are not as informed about economic history as they should be. If people had realized that, as of 2007, Greece had been in default 50% of the time since attaining independence in 1829 then recent events would perhaps have been less of a shock!<br /><br />There aren't that many new insights, however. One thing that is useful is that it is clear that from long term viewpoint it is only recently that most of the debt of emerging sovereigns has been raised externally and predominantly for the short term: eg from 1914-1959 70-80% of Latin American sovereign debt was long term. Also it appears that the incidence and impact of sovereign debt crises are not that different between emerging and more developed markets (which is perhaps less surprising now than it was when the book was published!). The book also shows how difficult it is for serial defaulters to break out into investment grade status. Investor confidence is crucial for the ability to sustain and rollover debt and therefore default can occur at relatively low levels- eg Ecuador's external debt/ GDP ratio when it defaulted in 2008 was a seemingly modest 20%.<br /><br />The authors very often try to summarize their main points in graphs: this has merits but is used tooften without more detailed analytical support. I found that there were too many graphs and not enough detailed analysis, with the result that the treatment often seems superficial. One graph that is very powerful however is the median inflation rate from 1500 onwards, from page 181. This clearly shows that although there is a clear inflationary bias through history, it spiked radically in the 20th century with the advent of fiat or paper money.  Inflation has leapt to a whole new level, however spectacular some of the historical coinage debasements were.<br /><br />A minor problem I have with the book is the uneven style, which may reflect different chapters being written by one of the two authors. It is pithy and witty in places but elsewhere one gets the worst kind of dense `academese'. For example on page 31 (the context is the all or nothing nature of emerging nations access to international debt markets):- `Arguably limited but stable access to capital markets might be welfare improving relative to the boom-bust pattern we so often observe'. The fog index is getting pretty high here for what is essentially a simple point.<br /><br />The book ranges over long periods, and this causes a problem given that the analyses are organised by country, and countries are not static things. It is not always clear that the authors are aware of the differences, a good example being the British Isles. They use the terms England, Britain and the United Kingdom interchangeably, which will no doubt annoy the Scots, Welsh and Irish even more than it does me. For example, in the section on currency debasement, statistics are given for the `United Kingdom' for the periods 1260-1499 and 1500-1799, whereas the United Kingdom did not exist until 1800, and Great Britain not until 1707. They say on page 175 that Henry VIII of England began a huge currency debasement, which was carried on by his son Edward VI after his death in 1547, but on the next page state that the United Kingdom achieved a 50% reduction in silver content in its coinage in 1551. I presume this is meant to be the English kingdom at the time, and not a weighted average including Scotland.<br /><br />Another error is quantifying the number of defaults by Spain (admittedly we are dealing with big numbers here). On page 70 it is stated that Spain has defaulted 13 times but on page 87 there are only 12 instances listed (1560 is omitted in error). It is unreasonable to expect a book with so much detail and analysis to be error-free but if it is easy enough for me to spot that is worrying!<br /><br />I know a lot more about banking crises than about the history of sovereign defaults, and this is the area where I have most concerns about the book's approach. The authors acknowledge that defining a banking crisis is very difficult. Their definition (page 10) is as follows:- \\"We mark a banking crisis by two types of events: (1) bank runs that lead to the closure, merging, or takeover by the public sector of one or more financial institutions and (2) if there are no runs, the closure, merging, takeover, or large-scale government assistance of an important financial institution (or group of institutions) that marks the start of a string of similar outcomes for other financial institutions.\\"<br /><br />The difficulty with this definition is that it is at once too inclusive and not inclusive enough. It includes events that are clearly not systemic banking crisis & misses others. Too inclusive because the failure of one bank for idiosyncratic reasons is surely not what we mean by a banking crisis, and yet, for example, the authors include the failures of Johnson Mathey in 1984, BCCI in 1991 and Barings in 1994, all of which, as far as I remember the market shrugged off as `sui generis' events, and there were certainly no systemic concerns.<br /><br />Not inclusive enough because historically the authorities have often been able to manage systemic crises behind the scenes, which I suppose couldbe called `suppressed' crises. A classic example would be the Latin American Debt Crisis of the 1980s, which was clearly a systemic banking crisis as well as a Sovereign Debt crisis. It was widely acknowledged at the time that if most of the larger international banks had been forced to reflect the true value of their exposures to Latin American and other emerging sovereigns their capital would have been decimated, and many would probably have failed. However, they were not forced to do so, with many a nod and wink between regulators, bank management & auditors. In fact, one of the many differences between the current crisis and previous ones is that in today's world, with the accountant's focus on the income statement, fair value accounting, and the abolition of hidden reserves, `regulatory crisis suppression' (to coin a phrase) is no longer feasible, for better or worse.<br /><br />The identification of banking crises is inconsistent as well. I would argue that there was an international banking crisis in 1974, as major economies were driven into recession after OPEC ramped up the world oil price. This crisis was partially suppressed. The secondary banking crisis in the UK is mentioned, but not the failure of Herstatt in Germany or the Franklin in the US, both of which had significant international impacts. Again, the authorities had to work hard to suppress these effects.<br /><br />Two recent events are not even included in the detailed list:-<br />a) Switzerland had a significant banking crisis in the 1990s, mainly due to policy lending by the cantonal and regional savings banks which led to a property bubble. More than half of the regional savings banks (over 180 banks) disappeared, and many of the cantonal banks required state support to prevent collapse, including Vaud, Geneva, Berne and Glarus<br />b) The German banking system came under severe pressure in the early noughties. Dresdner was effectively rescued by its largest shareholder, Allianz and many other banks received state support, either explicit or implicit.<br /><br />There were several crises in the US during the 1980s, for example the failure of Continental Illinois, The Savings & Loan crisis, and the impact of the Latin Amercian Debt Crisis as referred to above. However, these are just lumped together as `1,400 savings & loan failures & 1,300 bank failures 1984-1991', with no further comment! In fact these were a series of separate events with distinct causes and effects, for example regional and sectoral crises and the impact of deregulation.<br /><br />I have to conclude therefore that the analysis of banking crises is seriously flawed. The statistics presented on the basis of this analysis must also be suspect as a result;: the claim that the peak to trough decline in house prices after banking crises averages 35% and persists over 6 years sounds credible but if banking crises have been imperfectly identified in the first place, can we believe it?<br /><br />The authors deserve credit for trying to analyse crisis over such a broad sweep of history but perhaps the project was just too ambitious to be covered in one go. However, they have certainly provided a basis for discussion and no doubt will stimulate a lot of future research.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|The film Agora explores, without sentiment or melodrama, a time period and a subject that I have often overlooked; the violent and tragic end of the Pagan Classical World and the beginning of the Christian Dominated West, which also launched the Dark Ages. Watching this film I cannot help but ask myself, would we have been better off if the worshippers of Serapes and Isis had won the day.<br /><br />The movie was divided into two historic parts: the sheltered pagan world of wealth and status-quo where Christianity was no more than an annoying cult; and the Christian world under Emperor Theodosius with all of its early Patriarchs and Saints. The film's main character, Hypatia, was a sheltered, brilliant, upper class Pagan: a mathematician and philosopher living in a liberal world of free thought. Before her, all the ancient knowledge of Rome, Greece, and the Near East lay in scrolls in the Great Library of Alexandria: a treasure that only the pagans seemed to comprehend. This pagan world felt a little bit like our own, with its freedom of thought and its blind belief in the universal search for knowledge and understanding. One of my favorite things about the pagan world was that the elite Patricians and the wealthy Jews all enjoyed the theater.<br /><br />The pagan world presented in the film had a dark side as well. The slaves although treated somewhat warmly still had to wear a collar and they were also whipped. Another problem was in the established pagan cult religion of Serapes and its high priest who was an ass. But aren't so many \\"high priests\\" and people in authority asses, even today. It was a world in decline but Hypatia and the other privileged Pagans didn't know it. She dwelt in the realm of the mind, protected by the serapium and walls of the Great Library. Yet down below in the Agora the growing number of discontented Christians were about to rise up and smash the pagan world to bits. And that's exactly what they did, by tearing down the statues, takingover the city, and burning all of the scrolls in the library to ash, thus casting a darkness over the mind of the world which wouldn't lift until the Renaissance.<br /><br />In the second half of the film we see Christianized Alexandria some years later. Here the freedom of the mind that was so prevalent in the beginning has been crushed. Most members of the pagan Patrician class have by now converted to Christianity whether they believed in Christ or not. Hypatia is the last holdout, huddled in her mansion working on her brilliant theory of a heliocentric universe while the world around her slips into intolerant religious darkness based on faith and scripture alone. As the Bishop held the Bible over his head proclaiming that the scriptures say that women should be seen but not heard a chill went down my spine. The Christians had traded in all books and all knowledge for that one book: the Holy Bible. And we today are still suffering under the yoke of that mindset whenever evolution is disputed or someone thumps their Bible proclaiming it to be the indefatigable word of God.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, so let me start I bought this DVD two weeks ago. I did level one every other day. I lost 2 pounds as of now. Yesterday I did level 2 for the first time (very hard), but this is exactly how I felt when I first started level 1, so it is not a big deal to me. I will do level 2 ten times and then go to level 3. Then I will do level 3, ten times as well. I look thinner, but I only lost 2 pounds. I would like to lose 9 more pounds. I am 5.4 and my weight right now is 130 pounds. I also run once a week 5K. I eat healthier now, no fast food, and no sugar, only diet soda and breakfast every day. I will update my review once I finish level 2 and before I start level 3. You should really get this DVD, you will sweat but you will feel really good about yourself. I tried going to the gym, paid and never attended....this DVD is not an excuse not to exercise, it is only 25 min and so much easier than going to the gym.
0345529057|3.0|This is an excellent series, with the first three books being outstanding;however, Martin becomes so expansive during the fourth involving unnecessary characters and loses focus on the primary characters (the ones you love to read about) along with the fascinating dire wolves and dragons. These brilliant characters, including the animals, had they been fleshed out regularly would have made this a true competitor to Lord of the Rings. As it is, it just keeps widening the circle of droll places and detailed family lines that are quite boring to get through.  Had to resort to speed reading too many times to thoroughly enjoy the fourth.  Now I have second thoughts about the fifth and will wait a while before I commit. This was a remarkable series in my opinion, but Martin's editors/friends let him get out of control with his constant expanding of the circle.  It was like he became obsessed to keep growing the story, long after it was all in place to execute. I mean, seriously, upwards of a dozen great characters and half dozen amazing places and he had to increase it to 3 or 4 dozen characters and two dozen places. Just nutty to go that far. He had a beautiful Monet and turned it into a oversized mural.

I knew the movie was well-received and favorably reviewed on most sites, but I had no idea just how good of a film I was about to watch...<br /><br />First off, the setting... Treasure City.  I love all of the Hindu deities and symbols present throughout this gorgeous production.  The whole city is a wonderful spectacle full of brilliant, vibrant colors.<br /><br />The two stars of this production--Black and White--make an interesting family... White is definitely one the most unique characters from any anime I've seen.  Black is trying to take care of White and the city by any means necessary, and White is there helping Black keep it together (in his own way).  As White says during one scene with the police, \\"I have all the screws Black needs.\\"<br /><br />If you like watching anime that really stands out as being spectacular, you won't go wrong with Tekkonkinkreet.  Beautiful art, spectacular animation, and interesting characters all come together to create this masterpiece.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Kudos to Anthony Ryan for self-publishing this book. Too bad for all those publishers that turned him down, because this guy can tell a story - a damn good story.<br /><br />I loved this book - every page of it - cover to cover. It has mystery to draw you in, a new world to learn about and explore, characters with depth that feel as real as people you know. The story is engaging and draws you in. The main character is heroic, but not too much so. He's not perfect, and he's not unstoppable, but he is a force with which to be reckoned.<br /><br />The author is quite skilled in that he tells you this story with such depth, but does not waste words or overwhelm you with prose. There is action and brutality, but it is not a gore-fest. There is plot and character development, but they are balanced with the action. It is very well done.<br /><br />To the author I say: you're off to a great start, I hope the rest of the story is as good as this first installment.<br /><br />To the potential reader I say: go ahead, buy it. It will be the best three dollars you've spent in a long time.

Now that I have a new big flat screen TV & a new Bluray player....wow ! - But the best part is that they released this series in HD 1080P which really makes a difference folks ! I haven't watched any Bluray even in HD 1080P that has an image quality as good as this series. As for the series ? Of course what a cast, what a saga...I can't find anything negative about my purchase ! For those who are not familiar with the story, you can learn everything you need to begin the series on the first disk; the families, the Westeros history, the battles, the wall, etc. A pure marvel !!!!! - The only negative side is waiting for season 2 (march 2013 ???).
B003IKMR0U|4.0|We bust this out in between more in depth games like Ticket to Ride for a quick break.  It's fun to gamble on getting shotgunned or not while everyone roots for your demise.  It's lighthearted fun for a few minutes at a time.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game really try's my patience can become addicted my son turned me on to it a little nerve racketing but i like it.

B0086700CM|5.0|There is no lag its addicting and best of all it is free<br />And I think this game will change gaming forever
B0086700CM|4.0|I'd like it if it stopped pausing. sometimes it does a 1 second pause and then I can play. it does that every once in a while. needs update badly! I payed money for this!!!!! fix now.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|This is such an amazing author. Simply cannot put the books down. Had the privelegde of enjoying books one and two, and 80% through book three. Sad to see the story come to an end! Wish Stieg could have written more!
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I know that a lot of people will disagree with me on this reveiw and that's fine because we're all entitled to our own opinion and this just so happens to be mine.<br /><br />So here it is......<br /><br />HG was a terrible book in my opinion. It was written just as poorly as it was interpreted on the screen, in fact the only reason I'm giving this movie two stars is because I was thankful to God to not have to be stuck in the narrow mind of Katniss for how ever many hours this film was.<br />The camera was too shaky to see anything, I left the theater feeling dizzy with a headache. I won't stay on this topic for long but it has to be addressed.... Katniss and Peeta were not represented well in the movie at all. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely hated these characters in the book and couldnt care less who had the unfortunate task of portraying them on screen but if they're going to be made out as the new power couple in the world of fiction then the casting director could have at least picked people who looked remotely similar to the descriptions in the book.<br />Katniss was poor, hungry and a tree climbing hunter. She constantly says in the book how she's so much smaller than the rest of the competition and how she easily climbs trees because of her grace and small size. She's supposed to be olive toned and shorter than Peeta. In the book whenever they hug Peeta can place his chin on the top of her head. Yet in the movie they're the exact same size. They went and picked the tallest freaking amazon of a woman to portray Katniss and then paired her with this skimpy poor excuse of a boy for Peeta.<br />Peeta was supposed this hot stuff blonde, muscular and lean from carrying and lifting giant sacks of flour and other baking supplies on a daily basis. He's supposed to rival Gale in physical stature but those two couldnt have been more contrary to one another if they tried.<br />Gale, who is probably the only character represented correctly in the movie with the exception of Haymitch, is tall, brooding and helplessly in love but Peeta, poor poor Peeta is just ripped off completely.He's this short bleached blonde dude that almost has to look up at Katniss every time he speaks.<br />This movie was just so terrible to me but please don't be turned away from it. I think I only hated it because I despised the books--which I finished btw. But apparently a ton of people enjoyed the film so feel free to check it out. This is only my opinion after all.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This connect-the-points game is implemented simply but well. Instead of finding the shortest nonintersecting paths between paired points, the objective is to create nonintersecting paths that completely fill the grid.  On smaller grids, the goals are necessarily conjoined; on larger grids,  it's possible to construct paths that are invalid because they fulfill only the first criterion.  There are many puzzles per grid size; this is important, because the 5 x 5 and 6x6 puzzles can be solved in seconds.  I'm halfway through 8x8 now; some require a decent amount of thought or several attempts.<br />  My mathematically inclined husband saw this game on my Kindle Fire and quickly downloaded it for his iPad.  He also tried to explain the underlying graph theory, which I ignored.  :)

0375507256|5.0|After finally dusting off this book from my shelf, which sat for eight years untouched, I devoured it like an irresistible  drug. The spirits of the literature gods, dead and alive, have convened with Mitchell, and Mitchell has embraced the half-seen and the unseen, the lives and half-lives, and the mystical, boundless forces that turn a book into a world, a narrative into a universe. There's as much meaning outside the pages, and between words and passages, as there is in the explicit text--a potent cosmos of orbiting ideas. Mitchell has punched a hole in the sky with this book.<br /><br />That \\"everyone is connected\\" is not an original theme of literature. It has been done as prosaically as Coelho or as lofty as Nabokov. Mitchell's book of six nested stories is a furious and radiant masterpiece of formal structure and polyphonic elasticity, with the universal theme of connection--between generations, geographies, and centuries; people of vastly different ethnicities, cultures, even fabricated clones!<br /><br />From the South Seas of the mid-19th century to the post-apocalyptic future on Hawaii's islands, Mitchell explores the link between people as much as a thousand years apart in time and an incalculable amount of distance. Our undertakings, our destructions, our sorrow, our humanity, and our imperfections reach across the millennia. What communicates our exertions is our recording of things said and done.  \\"Sunt lacrimae rerum,\\" writes the protagonist of the second story. The world is a world of tears, and the burdens of mortality touch the heart.<br /><br />The six novellas that comprise the novel are written in ascending and descending order. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. There are great tonal shifts between stories, yet the parts equal the whole. As the narrator of the second novella says about his composition, Cloud Atlas Sextet, for six overlapping soloists (piano, clarinet, cello, flute, violin, and cello), they are \\"each in its own language of key, scale, and color.\\" There is much to say about music and the structure of this novel.<br /><br />And, in each story is a character with a comet-shaped birthmark, inferring incarnations of the same soul. The first five titles end in \\"Half-Lives\\" (which makes sense because they are only half a story) and the narratives end in a cliffhanger, usually an interrupted sentence or moment. The descending order (or latter half of each novella) pick up the Half Lives where they left off in the ascending stories.<br /><br />Story #1 is written Melville style, about a notary, Adam Ewing, on a ship in the South Seas, who is facing an ugly truth about people and their predatory nature. In story #2, Belgium, 1931, a scheming, disinherited opportunist, Robert Frorbisher, procures a job as an amanuensis to an ailing, syphilitic composer. His narrative is told via letters to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith, Waugh-style. He finds the interrupted journals of Ewing at the composer's house. In the third tale, set in mid-70's California, Luisa Rey, a journalist investigating nefarious activity at a nuclear power plant, is after some sensitive information from physicist Rufus Sixsmith. Luisa also acquires some of the letters that Sixsmith received from Frobisher. Her story has a distinctly Grisham/Chandler style.<br /><br />Story 4 is about a British publisher, Timothy Cavendish, who has a manuscript of the Luisa Rey story, but ends up imprisoned in a nursing home, trying to escape. Very Amis-y in narrative and characters. In the fifth story, Mieville-ish, set into Korea's future, the country is ruled by a totalitarian government, or \\"Corpocracy;\\" they clone \\"fabricants\\" who function without human sentience. When one fabricant, somni 451, develops human consciousness, her life becomes endangered. This is an era where words like starbucks and disney aren't proper nouns anymore. Somni is charmed by an archived disney from the 21st century called The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish.<br /><br />Thecentral story, #6, is whole, and the hardest to read (linguistically), where Somni is revered as a kind of enigmatic god-spirit. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world far, far into the future, where humans have reversed to a primitive or Iron Age state. The language is a sort of Twain-esque Pidgin. It takes a while for the dialect and colloquy to make sense, but the effort is worth the reward.<br /><br />Six places, six times, six vocabularies--in one choate, mind-twisting tale. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma (as Churchill would say), and obscured by clouds (as Pink Floyd would sing). There's always treacherous forces coming to annihilate us, manmade and cowardly; there are also moral, stouthearted, everyday flawed heroes with fugitive wings and incorruptible souls. We endure, and we endure, and we endure. We touch one another. Occasionally, we punch a hole in the sky.central story, #6, is whole, and the hardest to read (linguistically), where Somni is revered as a kind of enigmatic god-spirit.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|This book is entertaining in that it is the perfect example of 'flogging a dead horse', 'having too much of a good thing' and/or an excuse to write about every kinky sex act possible methinks.<br /><br />However, having said that I still could not stop reading it to the end (when I could stay awake long enough), just to find out what else was going to happen.<br /><br />The nice part was the romantic side (even though it is totally unbelievable) and I was pleased that the lust turned into love and romance.  For the first time ever it made me understand why some folk find porn pleasurable and, as a result, find that I am now less disgusted by it as a result.<br /><br />I only read this book out of curiosity to find out why everyone was talking about it and ended up buying and reading the two sequels as well(!) and was pleased to find the background story line becoming more interesting, even though totally unrealistic.<br /><br />The excitement of the book's release reminds me of that brought about by Lady Chatterley's Lover and The Kama Sutra in years gone by.  The interesting difference being in how much more easily this is accepted nowadays and talked about openly, rather than suggesting that it is naughty to read such things and keeping it all a big secret.  How times have changed!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read the whole trilogy and loved it, couldn`t put it down, best books I have read in ages, Very easy to read, good continuity, felt I really got to know the characters, Very good and original story line, many thanks, quite sad now I`ve finished them, Looking forward to more good reading from Suzanne Collins

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book parallels the time line in Book 4 for about 2/3's of it's lengthy volume. It covers characters that were not in Book 4 and introduces some new characters along with some marvelous descriptions of the free cities across the Narrow Sea. Very well written! There are a number of flamboyant characters that will lend themselves to portrayals in the HBO movie versions to come. Enjoy!
4721184115|5.0|This Japanese Imported Metallica album proves the fame and influence it has reached worldwide. Master of Puppet is inarguably one of the best metal albums ever released by a band. The Japanese version actually has a better audio quality if you listen carefully. It is also a great collector's item if you're a die hard metallica fan and an audiophile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not a big reader, but this book was so intriguing I read it in two sittings, never wanting to put it down. A savage, yet almost plausible, story line with a twist of romance is sure to keep your attention. The only reason I'm writing this review is because I'm waiting for book two to download to my android.
B000007UXS|5.0|The Bends features a much experimental and mature elements during radiohead's early works. The sound of the album contacts a broad range of acoustic, synthesizer, and electric guitar proved the versatility of the band's influence on modern music industry. It is definitely one of my top favorite albums of radiohead and the vinyl version has much clearer tone than the cd.

B000063DI9|5.0|The seventh son of a seventh son inherited the synthesized and experimental sounds from its predecessor somewhere in time but with the exception of been a concept album. Much of the songs show direct connections both rhythmically and lyrically. It is apparently showing a story behind this since much of iron maiden's songs derive from movies, history, and fantasies.

B006QVRVJK|5.0|This entire little film made me smile throughout. I half-expected fighting to break out between the warring couples, but they never come to blows. They do, however, eviscerate each other with words as they come apart at the seams in a meeting that starts friendly, but soon turns ugly over whose child is at fault for a playground fight. It's fun to watch the shifting dynamics as the men side with each other, and the couples come apart, but not for long as the ground keeps shifting under everyone's feet. Jodie Foster is perhaps the most cartoonish, the veins in her neck about to explode as she turns on the rage. Kate Winslett's projectile vomit onto the coffee table was very funny. It's all over in 75 minutes, just right.
1452101248|4.0|I waited for a couple months to take the book from the library. Finally I got the book and have opportunity to introduce myself to Yotam's cooking. First of all, I would like to say, I found several easy and quick recipes which I wish to try. I have already tried the first one: [...] It's quite good and healthy. I think, Yotam did a pretty good job writing good book. Some of his recipes I will make over and over again.
B00407PNWO|5.0|I grow up watching old movies on television late at night. This is one of my favorites. Good vs Evil, true love, and some pretty decent action sequences. The movie is simple, yet filled with exceptional acting by Flynn, de Havilland, and Rathbone. Pop in the DVD, grab some popcorn and enjoy.
B003XU02QG|5.0|Beautiful cinematography and superb musical accompaniment, yes, as many reviewers have noted. The lead is<br />terrific. The action is fantastic. Bad guys, good guys, bad good guys...lots of surprises. I found it very<br />suspenseful, and somehow or other they found a way to slip in a love plot. Everyone does his job wonderfully.<br />If you like historical action films, you'll love this one.
B003ZWN7KU|2.0|Whomever paid to make this movie must be as dumb as a zombie...talk about a bad plot, bad acting, bad makeup/special effects, etc.  I only watched it due to my love for zombie films.  Sadly, I'll never get that time back.  Nothing about this movie made it worth a watch.  Two stars for being a zombie flick.  Zero stars for the content.
B0086700CM|5.0|this a great game. my kids enjoy playing it. lots of replay value.  a must have for any droid User.
1451627297|5.0|I read this book slowly and carefully and it is full of practical information about life, a blessing to anyone who takes the time to enjoy it. I paid full price and it was well worth it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read alot of hate reviews saying Katniss is weak and whiny. And that she is terrible at leading a war. She is a girl who's father died and survived the Hunger Games. I don't think any person could be very confident if all that happened happened to you.<br />  I loved the ending. Even after Snows  hijacking and trying to kill Katniss, Peeta still marries her. Gale l think is being to dramatic. ln their 1st Games, when Katniss and Peeta where in the cave l knew it was gonna be Peeta. Peeta just has this goodness that just goes through the 1st 2 books. Then the Capitol hijacks him and he still find his love again for her and goes to district 12 with her. Whereas, Gale is in district 2 isnt with Katniss.<br /><br />I love this book and highly recomend it.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I think it is an excellent production. However I have been waiting for the second season for quite a while and not one tells you what's going on.....I will highly recommend it.
0802130208|1.0|I read this years ago, and found myself disliking it immensely from the first chapter.  I forced myself to finish it and seem to remember liking that at least we sort of got somewhere, to some sort of plot conclusion, at the end.  That's about all I can say in its defense.  It's turgid, not funny, and I really don't care about what happens to a single character.  Now, I had to read it again for my book club this month,and I put it down after just re-reading the Kindle sample.<br /><br />Ignatious is a slacker and unattractive person with no redeeming qualities.  Other characters are just foils for his so-called antics and are neither believable nor interesting.  I think the writing is poor, and I guess I just don't get the hype.  I wonder if the author received the Pulitzer for dying, much as I think Heath Ledger won the Oscar for the same reason.<br /><br />If I want to read a book in which the characters are slackers, I'd rather re-read Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat. That at least had both real humor and real pathos.  This, in my opinion, is just crap.
1455113549|4.0|This audio book was ideal for our 2000 mile vacation trip. My husband and I with my 80+ year old parents were immediately hooked.  We had several stops to make on our road trip and we found ourselves saying lets get back in the car so we can listen to \\"the book\\".  The reader is excellent, his mellow and warm voice gave us a good feel for the characters.  We stopped the audio several times to discuss what we would do if we were in the same situation as Jabob and his parents. Highly recommend this book for both men and women.

0345803507|4.0|A lot of fun to read and learn how others enjoy their relationships and sex life.  Not great literature, but oh so entertaining with some mystery and a fast pace of writing.
B005CA4SJW|3.0|Love the series. Like the DVD's.  I don't know why but if you choose \\"play all\\", some of the episodes are edited for gore. So to get the \\"full\\" original cut you gotta play each episode individually. That's kinda dumb.
0425263908|3.0|I just finished Bared to you after reading all fifty shades.  I think the books are rally similar in story.  I think one of the two writers had to have copied the other one.  I don't know who wrote them first.  However I still enjoyed reading Bared to you with all the similarities.  It's basically the exact same story with different names and cities.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very good app! it tells you how much energy you have left and much more! totally worth the space and 0.00 dollars!
B004FJNQ8U|5.0|The Expendables man do I love this movie. I saw this in the theater back in The Summer of 2010 & I had a ball with this movie. I remember when I heard that Stallone was going to do a throw back with all the old 80's & 90's action stars this was back in late 2008 when I heard about it I was on. Cause if you know anything about me I love the old school action movies I get that times change you look back in 1985 then you fast forward to 1989 action movies went into a darker direction late 80's early 90's movies have a different tone than movies released in the early to mid 80's. In the mid 90's the style is a lot different then in the late 90's early 2000's. I enjoy movies released in the 70's 80's 90's even up until the 2005 or 2006 time frame. You know the past 8 9 years Hollywood has watered down action movies to PG 13 not that I hate PG 13 action movies but you look at action movies released in the 80's, 90's & some in the early 2000's 95 percent of them are R rated. I mean also another thing that's been killing the action genre was trying to make guys like Matt Damon who is a good actor an action star but also actors like Tobey McGuire a horrible actor, Channing Tatum no matter what genre Hollywood tries to put him to me he should've stuck with male strippi9ng cause he's an awful actor & very overrrated. Taylor Lautner they tried to make him an action star & I was thinking you got to be kidding me. Outside of Twlight he's never drew a dime. Adrien Brody they tried to shove him down our throats in 2010 but everything he was in bombed thankfully. Anoter thing that is killing the action genre is trying to have 50 different sub plots that go nowhere trying to make it an acting piece like they are making an Oscar contender they for forget abot the main reason were watching an action movie THE ACTION! So getting to this movie Stalllone made a huge come back in 2006 with Rocky VI & wrapped that franchise up. In 2008 he went & made Rambo IV & finished that franchise up. Then he did The Expendables a throw back to the old action movies. Stallone directed it he is just a solid director. He stars as Barney Ross, Jason Statahm as Lee Christmas, Jet Li as Yin Yang, Terry Crews as Hale Ceaser, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jenson, Mickey Rourke as Tool Box, Eric Roberts as Monroe, Steve Austin as Dan Paine, David Zayas as General Garza of course you had cameos by Bruce Wilis & Arnold Schwarzenegger & Giselle Iaie as Sandra. The story pretty simple you have Merc's that do all this work. You start off where they rescue  some hostages from Somali Pirates Gunner takes this shot gun & blows the lead pirate in half it results in the team getting in a shoot out. Gunner is going to hang 1 of the pirates Yin Yang tries to stop him but he is backed up into a wall The Leader Of The Expendables Barney Ross puts a gun up to Gunner & makes him stop. So they have to cut him from the team cause of his drug problems & other personal problems. Then you have another 1 of Merc's Lee Christmas visit his Girlfriend Lacy where he finds out she is seeing another man. Then your introduced to Tool Box who used to be a Merc he's now a Mission Coordinatior for the team. He's also a tatoo artist & you get a pretty funny back & forth with Mickey Rourke & Jason Statham. Cause Jason Statham is bald & Mickey Rourke said that I should put a spider web on his head. Barney Ross goes & sees this man named Mr Church played by Bruce Willis & you have a rival Merc named Trench played by Arnold Schwarzenegger the theater I was in had a good laugh with this scene Arnold tells him that he's lost weight Stallone responds by saying \\"Whatever weight I lost you found pal.\\" Then you had what  Bruce Willis said in response that got some laughs. Trench says \\"Give this job to my friend he loves playing in the jungle\\" Then you have him ask Ross why don't we have dinner sometime. Ross asks when Trench says \\"I a thousand years.\\" Ross: \\"Too soon.\\" Mr Church wounders what his problem is Ross tells him \\"He wants to be President.\\" I heard so many people complain about that scene was stupid when this movie came out they complained it was only a 1 minute. 1st off Arnold was still The Governor at this point & Bruce Willis was busy with 3 or 4 other movies I mean I would hope with the sequel coming out that they would get more time. So they get this work in Vielna to go after this dictator. Ross & Lee go & check the island out. They go in & act like they are photographers they meet this contact named Sandra. Ross wants to get a look at the palace. You're inroduced to this CIA turncoat named Monroe he basically runs the show he tells General Garza what to do. Lee goes off to get a look around the area. While Ross is looking at the palace General Garza's Soldiers show up they try & take Sandra Ross tries to stop them he is attacked & about to be killed until Lee shows up throws a blade into a soldiers head. Ross takes his gun & takes down Garza's men very good action scene with Lee fighting them off taking them down with his knives. 1 of the men is taking Sandra off Lee throws a knife into that guys back. Then you have 1 of the troops pop up Ross shoots that guy up he fired above Lee's head his reaction is great \\"Are you crazy you could've killed me!?\\" Ross; \\"You're welcome!\\" Ross decides to take Sandra with them. They are being chased they are trying to get to their plane. Good chase scene they tell her that there is nothing here. Ross has them go on to the plane he goes into this office takes down 2 of Garza's men then you have this guard at the desk Ross says \\"You look nervous?\\" he shoots that guy dead. Sandra stays behind. Ross makes his way to the plane. Then you have this amazing scene on the dock Jason Statham goes into this hidden compartment on the plane guns down a bunch of Garza's Soldiers then they drop axel fuel on the dock he fires this flare gun then you get a nice practical explosion. However Monroe & Dan Paine jump into the water in time. You find out that Sandra is General Garza's Daughter & Monroe makes Garza capture her. Gunner makes a deal with Monroe to go after Barney Ross & his team. There is a good back & gorth with Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin & Gary Daniels. Ross decides not to do the job. Then you have Lee find out that Lacy's BF has been hitting her. He goes to The Basketball Court where him & his friends are at & owns all of them he takes a Basketball places it on him takes a knife & flattens it he says \\"Next time I will deflate all your<br />b  all  s.\\" I pretend that's Adrien Brody or Channing Tatum for trying to think their action stars. Sandra is captured & he tunts Garza about it. Then you have this wounderful scene where Mickey Rourke has this excellent monoluge cause Ross tells Tool Box that it's bothered him he left Sandra behind. Tool Box tells him this story when he was in Bosnia & this woman jumped off a bridge & he tells him after all the lives he took the 1 I could've saved still bothers me. It gives Barney Ross the drive to do what he has to do. He's going to go alone but you have yin go with him & you find out that his character is a dreamer he wants more money for his family. Then you have this really good chase scene where Gunner & some of Monroe's men are chasing them. Yin Yang had been complaining how it's difficult for him being the smallest. Ross makes him get in the back of the truck he tells him cause he is smaller. You have him gunning down the people chasing after them you have Ross doing everything to evade them. Where he leads Gunner into a warehouse. Then you have a good gfight with Dolph Lundgren & Jet Li. I know there are complaints that it's too short. You want to see a fight scen that is too short & a major let down the fight with Dolph Lundgren & JCVD in Universal Soldier Regeneration is. Great line with Dolph saying \\"What are you wearing a size 3 bring it happy feet!\\" It's a well shot fight it does have some shakey cam but not as bad asThe Bourne films. Yin Yang leads him into a low clerance area. He gets some good kicks in Gunner gets the advantage & starts press slamming him. Ross shoots Gunner. Ross wants to find out who sent him. Gunner asks if he's going to die he tells him he got him a couple of inches above the heart. He tells him who sent him. Then you have the entire team go to Vielna & omg the last 18 minutes are some of the most action packed I've seen in 10 or more years.Their sneaking into the palace. Ross is going to get Sandra. The team is placing explosives around the palace using stealth tatics taking down Garza's men. Ross finds Sandra who they have been tourtering by Monroe's men Ross goes in there & how Ross takes these 2 gaurds down is just pure ownage. There escaping where they run into Dan Paine & Gary Daniels . Steve Austin in this scene really acted like Stone Cold when he was asking who he was with I wish that he brought this level of acting to his other movies. They have taken Sandra off to go see her Dad. So you have the rest of the team come in & save Ross. You have a really good fight  with Stallone & Austin going on. Meanwhile you have the rest of the team in a shoot out with Monroe's men. Jet Li has good fight with Gary Daniels. Randy Couture helps Jet Li finish himoff. Then you have that scene where Stallone injured his neck I'm sure that Austin didn't mean to do it cause he suffered a really bad neck injury back in 1997. I give Stallone all the credit in the world for finishing the movie cause if that had been 1 of the dorks from Twlight they would've shut production down for 6 months. So you have the team in a shoot out with a bunch of Garza's Troops they have been pinned down behind cover. Then you have my favorite scene Hale Ceaser come in with that AA 12 Shot Gun & mows Garza's forces down. Robbie Rod, Nimrod & Adrien Brody this is an AA 12 Shot Gun take notes. Garza throws some money at Monroe & tells him to leave cause he has done so much damage to Vielna. You have him tells his Daughter that her way was the right way. Garza gives this speech to his troops Monroe kills him he makes it look like it was The Merc's they take Sandra & try to escape to the helicopter. Then the action doesn't let up at all they set off the charges you have a nice big explosion. You have The Merc's go to town Terry Crews going to town with that AA 12 Shot Gun. Stallone with a 9 MM. Just insane action scenes with these 5 men. Ross has Yin Yang cut off Monroe he tosses a gernade to blcok him from gettin to the helicoper. Toll Road finish's Dan Paine off a brief fight my only complaint was the CGI was bad . Ross has this warhead he throws up in the air he takes his gun & shoots it & blows the helicopter up. Then Ross goes after Monroe. Monroe tells him to drop the gun. Then he shoots Ross he tells Ross why did you come all this way to come after me. He tells him that he didn't comje to get him he came for the girl. He takes a revolver fires at him at the same time Lee throws a knife into Monroe's back. Ross gives Sandra a share of their payment to help with Vielna's recovery. I was suprised that Dolph was still alive but hey I'm glad they kept him for the sequel. I'm sorry if I didn't explaiin the plot all that well in my retrospective. Or it I didn't talk about the other action stars trust me their in here. My only complaint is The CGI but as long as I care about the characters & I'm entertained I won't be harsh on The CGI. Stallone did a great job directing & acting. Jason Statham was good. Jet Li was good. Terry Crews was good. Randy Couture I was suprised by. Mickey Rourke was very good. Eric Roberts did a great job. David Zayas I thought did a very good job. This was Steve Austin's best role. Gary Daniels was fine. Gisallle  Iaie did a good job. I enjoyed The Willis & Schwarzenegger cameos.Unfortantly  The Blu Ray  only has features & the features are awesoeme. I mean check your brain & don't go in expecting an Oscar contender & oh yeah  Iam ready for The Expendables 2
0345803485|5.0|In the beginning of the book, it was hard to understand. My English is not as good as everybody else but the first few pages are confusing and I felt like I'm in an ESL class again lol... Anyways, after that few confusing pages. Overall, the book is not that bad. It has excitement, romance, SEX, and jealousy. I like it. I just started reading the first book and I already bought the other two. I'm looking forward in reading all of it :)<br /><br />I am updating my review about this book 8/28/12. This book is awesome. I don't why alot of people don't like it. I love the way that Mr. Grey is taking in charge of everything specially in bed. This book makes me imagine of things that I wish my hubby would do to me LOL hahahaha!!! TMI.... Anyways, overall 5 thumbs up!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has a ton of fun mini games. it reminds me of the old warioware game for the gameboy.  cool concept of earning your play time.
1476712042|5.0|Now, I admit that it does not take that much to keep me happy with a book. A good love story or a little mystery is all I really need to keep me excited and reading. This book definitely was the former. There were parts that were somewhat corny, but in a sweet and romantic way.  I read it from start to finish in 2 days (while working full work days) so I did not get that much sleep, ha ha. But I could not put it down! I loved the characters. Abby drove me nuts for most of the book! But I still found her likable. And I LOVED Travis. I laughed a ton, and felt sadness, happiness, butterflies. I really liked this book. Now, if you are too critical of things being really realistic or do not like things that are too cliche, there are parts in this book you may not like. But if you are happy with a sweet and romantic love story (with actually a little mystery that is not very predictable) like I am  you will probably love this book too!
B002VECM4K|3.0|I thought the performances of the actors was great. Mo'Nique really stepped up to the plate to play 'Mary', Precious' ruthless and abusive mother. The film is one i would rather forget. Some scenes are so disturbing i can not watch them, and if you haven't seen this movie yet then i will not say what they are, you really need to see the movie for yourself and make your own judgement call. I really don't think it deserves all the hype that it got, but i do think it is a movie that should be watched, at least once.

B006BG7RI0|5.0|Contrary to what it may appear from Amazon's current \\"Most Helpful Favorable Review,\\" the 70th Anniversary editions from 2012 are a step up from the previous Blu-ray release in both video and audio quality.<br /><br />This newest release features a 4K transfer and uncompressed audio; do not be misled by the reviews of earlier versions when deciding whether or not to purchase this one.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Exciting storyline combined with clever puzzles and references to the computer games I played as a kid.  One of the best books I have read in recent years.
0307277453|5.0|After reading the reviews, I can't imagine what new information to give readers, its all been said.  The author writes with enough simplicity while keeping on track with the idea of all his finding from fish to humans via evolution.  Some interesting notes:  He goes into great detail about our inner-ear bones and how they first came from a fish and it wasn't for hearing.  How him and his team found fossils of a prehistoric fish that was between fish and mammal.  The exciting part of that is its like seeing the evolution happening in front of your eyes.  They were able to figure out this species had evolved away from fish and started on its way to what possibly was a mammal (it had both gills and lungs..among other things).  His genetic examples of how scientist can manipulate certain genes to turn off and on.  This timely event can trigger growing eyeballs on flywings and ears in places that weren't meant to have ears all due to fetus development and timing of the events that follow for us naturally....facinating!
B0026OE2NY|5.0|I had no awareness of this documentary until I discovered it through Amazon's suggestion. I was so impressed that I purchased 2 more copies and had them sent to my sons. This is a film everyone should see and I am amazed that so few are aware of it.
030758836X|5.0|I love a good mystery, and this book was beyond good! Just when the reader thinks she/he has it ALL figured out, they realize they don't. Nope. The story has been rearranged, shook up, and according to whoever is now telling their story, a different view pops up. I hope to use this book for my club, unless someone else snatches it before I can.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it .it is great for anything. and you can us it for work or any other things you need
B006RUJST6|3.0|This book was dripping with cheese.  If you like 'feel-good' books about overcoming adversity, you may enjoy the easy read.
0374275637|5.0|I came across this book in Amazon.com's best seller list.<br /><br />My System One brain instantly framed it as one of those book's similar to \\"[[ASIN:055380491X Emotional Intelligence: 10th Anniversary Edition; Why It Can Matter More Than IQ]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:0684847248 The Road Less Travelled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth]]\\" . This book is certainly different. As a Noble Prize winner, this book is a distillation of the Author's experience as to how our brain works from the mundane tasks, when you are waiting at a train station, or framing a person's personality based on how they look,or a complicated problem of multiplying 17 X 34. Not to mention that the author's experiences and experiments were used extensively by Israel Army . For a common man like me and most of the readers, it is one heck of an  interesting book.<br /><br />The book does add to a nice \\"Water cooler conversation\\".<br /><br /> At a superficial level, you can begin with asking the bat and ball question ( A bat cost $1.10 ; the bat costs $1 more than the ball; How much does the ball Cost?). or the Example of Lillies covering the lake. The example goes on and on. And here is where the Author win's big time. The book is kept interesting all along explaining how our day to day life's are shaped by the fast thinking section of the brain; and how little we can do anything about it.  This book also answers another age old question...If you trade in stocks or predict any form of future events, why following a clear set of rules is usually the better option  than being discretionary (Slow acting Section of the brain rectifies the fast thinking bias) .There are plenty of takeaways to prove that simple words becomes thoughts become you ( Two groups of students talking to a controlled set of audience and walking; one set walking slower than the rest ). The book does not provide lot of actionable items for improving your life, but if you read it with focus, even the passing swipes can be very useful ( If you can give one thing in life to your child, it should be cultivating optimism. Success  is overwhelmingly tilted towards optimists)<br /><br />This is not a \\"self help\\" book ;nor a novel ; nor a textbook  - But certainly a perfectly blended smoothie of all three !wipes can be very useful ( If you can give one thing in life to your child, it should be cultivating optimism.

B005BCE7FQ|4.0|I liked it better than anticipated, almost love it - and will definitey watch again.  It was colorful and of course lots of silliness, but not stupid.  Thumbs up here.
0307454568|2.0|I read book 1 and book 2 and loved them.  Im 1/4 through the 3rd and so far I find it quite boring and horribly written.  I'm hoping it gets better.
B0080BFWAE|5.0|What a classic! I felt as giddy as a kid watching this movie many, MANY years later. Such a fun movie with great characters. Shue is wonderful in this as Chris, the BABYSITTER, lot's of laughs and just an all around good time. I jumped at this blu ray when I saw it available for pre-order. Plus, it dropped a couple of bucks with the price match guarantee. If you haven't seen this wonderful film I say you've just got to check it out. They just don't make them like they used to.
0142421375|4.0|Thirteen-year-old Theodore Boone's friend April has disappeared. The clues are thin and the police's investigation is moving slower than mud running uphill. He decides to start his own investigation. With the help of few close friends and his Uncle Ike, he tracks down a chain of clues that lead nowhere. When the dead body of an unidentified girl washes ashore, things get dicey. Could it be April? If not, will they find her in time to save her from a similar fate?<br />  Although Theodore is only thirteen, he reads more like a fifteen-year-old and the issues raised such as drug use during the course of the story are more appropriate for a young adult reader than a middle grader. The mystery is good, Theodore is likable and mystery readers should enjoy the ride. kidsmysteryreviews.com

B0085A9HXS|2.0|I saw many positive reviews for this movie so I rented it. I now believe those positive reviews were paid for because this movie is at best ordinary. Rudimentary plot, bad cinematography, sloppy stunt work and a general lack of creativity. The fights were not interesting and often looked like rehearsal fights from movie extras.<br />For a martial arts movie the violence is only average. There is nothing in this movie worth watching again so I would not buy it at any price. The inflated reviews are the only interesting thing about this movie.

0671042858|1.0|I enjoy the work of Stephen King and believe that he is the father of modern day horror fiction. Unfortunately, \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" is not a work I would consider to be a favorite of mine. It doesn't hit the mark when it comes to the horror, the plot, and the character development that Stephen King is known for having and excelling at.<br /><br />Trisha McFarland is on a camping trip with her recently divorced mother and brother, who are arguing about the separation. During this time, Trisha goes for a bathroom break, but ultimately finds herself lost in the woods. During this time period, she treks deep into the woods, coming across many of obstacles, from a bear to her own body (hallucinations and pneumonia).<br /><br />In the mean time, her mother and brother find cops to look for her. However, they don't search far enough into the woods. There is belief she is murdered, which causes their involvement to die down pretty quickly.<br /><br />The lack of character involvement in this novel is something unusual for Stephen King. The goal to this novel seems to follow the notion of being adventurous and how this young girl loves Tom Gordon of the Boston Red Sox, which inspires her to make it through plenty of obstacles in the book. However, that's about that.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" is the first King novel I read and was unfortunately my least favorite. If you want to read good Stephen King pieces, try \\"Bag Of Bones,\\" \\"Hearts In Atlantis,\\" \\"The Green Mile,\\" or plenty of others I could name for you. Skip this one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It reads as well as the others and the story continues well. Katniss struggles must come to an end. but how? I can't seem to stop reading. and I will be sorry, when it finally ends, to say \\"Farewell\\" to Kat and friends.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a self proclaimed YA fiction junkie.  That said I found this book resonated with me despite my 40+ years.  Rarely does a book about cancer make one laugh out loud on one page and then come to tears on the next.  I loved this book and like some of the other people who read this book too quickly, wished that I had taken more time to enjoy it.  Please don't misunderstand me, when the book was over, I was satisfied with the ending.  I just wish that it hadn't ended. Strangely, I wish I had a chance to visit with these \\"friends\\" a little bit longer.

B0086700CM|2.0|Fun at first,  then as you progress,  instead of adding variety,  thegame simply cheats. Ignore strokes, slam a tree while clearly sliding, double chasms but mainly the sudden ignoring jump or turn strokes as you advance is simply the program cheating. Lose interest fast then. -gaming on machines since th 70s.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|very nice I like it because in it an bird and have very thing importing. and very nice thing andthe red bird is very nice and beutiful
B0080CL0HM|2.0|I rented this based on the high star rating, what a disappointment. Usually the amazon reviews are a little less slanted, but maybe it is my bias due to having read the book and being French.<br /><br />I will say if you liked this film, then definitely read the book, you will love it.<br />The film is a really badly written and shortened version of what is a great book.<br /><br />First major flaw is the scriptwriting, which condenses or ignores major plot points. It's a frequent problem for book to film adaptations, but this one is really bad. Towards the end the film summarizes major plot points in one or two scenes in a very sloppy way.<br /><br />The casting was also a problem, Christina Ricci was perfect, and Uma Thurman was a pretty good choice, but Robert Pattison is just bad, very one dimensional in representing a character that is far more complex than comes out in the film.<br /><br />Another major flaw is the set design, which if you are not French or never lived in France won't matter much to you. But if you care, the sets look nothing like 19th century France. Not sure where it was filmed, but the furniture, decorations and buildings look like 19th century British or American, which is really glaring.<br /><br />Also a big disappointment is they didn't film the final scene in the real Madeleine church in Paris, that setting is an essential part to the end of the book. It is a major monument in Paris and the fact that the final scene takes place there is quite significant, it is not just any church in a random place...
1466401885|5.0|Good book but I thought it ended short. I mean really, it just stopped. I have questions and apparently the author is not going to make another book. I hope she does one where they are at least in the background so I can get closure.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this most readable history of the Second World War. Beevor as a historian writes very well and is unafraid to give his opinion but does so in a calm reasoned manner without being  sarcastic and bombastic. Beevor does not think much of Churchill as a military leder (most historians feel that Churchill was a distinct liability when it came to military strategy), he also  feels that F.D.R. was woefully naive when it came to Joseph Stalin (correct), Eisenhower was no great battle captain, Bernard Montgomery was a self blow hard, Erwin Rommel was a self promoter and overrated, Mark Clark sucked and Omar Bradley was mediocre at best. Beevor's coverage of the Eastern Front is thankfully quite extensive. A few minor quibbles - Beevor does not cover the Dodececanese campaign of 1943 (a British disaster!) and fails to mention that Field Marshal Gunther von Kluge committed suicide in August 1944 after being relieved of his command as he knew he was going to face a People's Court trial and execution in Berlin. All in all though, this is a very well written and fast reading book.

B004HW7JH4|2.0|it is amazing to me that people loved this season.  i've been a fan of Mad Men since day one, and Season 5 isn't good.  and not just bad by Mad Men standards.  kind of similar to a good band making a bad record.  so many bad episodes and storylines: Don's hallucination that he kills one of the many women he's bedded.  Pete's Metro-North affair.  Harry having sex in his office with some Hari-Krishna woman.  Joan prosituting herself for Jaguar (and everyone except Don, who's not a good guy either, going along with it).<br />\\"Bravo!\\" exclaims Cooper when they get the business.  give me a break.  Roger becoming an LSD freak.  yea, right.  i could go on and on...<br /><br />not sure whether Matthew Weiner lost his touch, is too full of himself at this point or what.  but Season 5 of Mad Men just isn't very good.  remains to be seen if the show can recover...
B005AERS74|4.0|Call me old fashioned, but I still prefer an album to a single when I get music. If I were to get one Maroon 5 album, it would be Songs About Jane. I got this when it was one sale since I really do like the radio hit Moves Like Jagger -- but as whole this album doesn't stand up to the repeated listens quite the same way as the debut album does. There is a lot to love here, but for the most part what I found that I liked I had already heard on the radio, this might be one of those exceptions to my rule where getting the hit tracks only is the way to go.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't waste your time and money on this book.. Terribly written and highly repetitive. I got bored after reading the first few chapters. I won't buy the sequels. Enough said.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|WIld was a story worth reading. The author shared her physical and emotional journey in an interesting well written way. Both journeys kept my attention. I found myself pushing on and wanting to hear her tale while rooting for her success in both her physical and emotional growth.. Even if this is not your favorite genre, it is worth a your own journey out of the box. The Kindle edition was a pleasure to read.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is aweeome! the puzzles are enticing and so enjoyable! can be hard at times,  but that's what makes it fun :D it's defenitely worth the money! :) if you like puzzles that is. also rampage mode is great because you get to destroy items,  which can hold lots of fun XD the characters are adorable and it's just a great game!
1439190275|5.0|Very easy to read and understand. Well organized and straight to the point.  Not sales-y at all, just the Atkins way of looking at food groups and how they affect your metabolism.  I have tried other approaches without much success.  But this has worked for me.  I lost 13 lbs. in the first phase (2 weeks), and continue to lose.  I was mis-informed about the Atkins plan but when a friend told me of his success I investigated and made it my own success.  Don't believe what you hear and read until you've read a book like this that offers the Atkins point of view.  Then decide for yourself.  But I recommend trying it and doing it like they say.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  Good Book.
0439023521|5.0|I haven't read such a remarkable, action-packed, well-written, suspenseful YA book since Harry Potter! I started this book about three days ago, and only put it down when I had to. Here is a non-spoiler summary.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, is a sixteen-year-old, hunter, who lives with her mother and sister in district 12 of Panem: a country that was once known as North America. Every year, a lotto is drawn, and two kids (one of each gender) between the ages of 12-18 are chosen to compete in a tournament known as, The Hunger Games.<br /><br />This particular year, Kat volunteers to take her younger sister's place after her name was chosen in the draw. She is then paired up with the baker's son, Peeta. Together, the two of them are flown to The Capital, dressed up, and paraded around on live TV. After training, they join the other 24 kids in a gladiator type battle. The last one alive is declared the winner.<br /><br />This book reminded me of the classic novel, The Deadliest Game. Humans must battle other humans, except The Hunger Games is being broadcast on live TV back home, and all over Panem. I wasn't really expecting the ending, that's how well-written the novel is.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

B001EX81ZI|5.0|I'm not sure what to say to make these exciting but they work just as described. I like to pump into the bottle on the go and making sure my milk doesn't spill out is key. After several attempts to use the nipples and caps, I decided I needed sealing discs. They work great. Make sure you also use all the parts to the cap though or else you will have spilt milk.

B007STBUIW|5.0|I was really peeved at Hollywood for taking so long to release Spielberg's films on Bluray. A lot of them are still unreleased. But digital restorations such as this make the wait almost worth it.<br /><br />I've never seen a film this old be restored to such perfect clarity. There is absolutely no grain or imperfections. The sound quality is incredible. If you want the best copy of Jaws, suck it up and get a Bluray player already!<br /><br />But seriously Hollywood, hurry up with the rest of Spielberg's films.
0385342063|3.0|As a fan of Ms. Kinsella's other books, I am sorry to say<br />that this one is not her best work. It is slow-paced, and<br />sometimes tedious. The lost engagement ring plot is an<br />interesting one, but it just doesn't hold up as the central<br />theme for a novel.
0312576463|4.0|Franzen has a gift for capturing how contemporary American characters of 3 different generations think, act, and talk.  His characters are complicated, believable,and ultimately likeable.<br /><br />I don't believe he adequately develops his overall theme about freedom -- which I take to be a meditation on what contemporary Americans do with their freedom of action and on the burdens of freedom.  He ultimately finds some nobility in characters like Walter, who get beyond the self-absorption of contemporary Americans to crusade for the larger environmental issues and threats which may make our all of our perceived \\"freedoms\\" illusory.  The character of his wife, Patty, is ultimately more amibiguous, though she emerges as a person of some empathy who can bring out the best in Walter and others.  Both Patty and Walter suffer from many false starts, delusions, and wrong turns. This helps to reveal their character, though the book is far too long.<br /><br />Franzen can also be extremely funny, particularly in his depiction of Joey, the son of Patty and Walter.  Franzen's politics are clearly left of center, though his more right-wing characters have their charm.  I didn't find his politics overly intrusive, though some more politically conservative readers might become irritated.<br /><br />The opening of the book is dreadful.  Franzen tells a quick story of Patty and Walter's move to St. Paul and how they raised their kids.  His sketch is superficial and he seems to dislike all of his characters -- leaving the reader to wonder why one should even be reading this book.  This must have been some kind of deliberate device -- though Franzen is guilty of some overthinking here.  Never burden your reader with a mediocre and stupid set of opening chapters.  Franzen has the ability to bring some very compelling and complex characters to life.  Why he felt compelled to sketch them in such superficial and unappealing terms at the beginning of the novel escapes me.  The only reason I kept reading the book was that the critics have been so complimentary.  So, you must have patience with this book and get beyond the initial chapters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I started reading this book on the plane to our vacation destination but then couldn't put it down.  It was such a good book and the ending was not what I had expected.  This was my first Nicholas Sparks book and I will definitely be reading another one!!
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is a novel I found thrilling and frustrating in equal measure.<br /><br />Gone Girl starts out very much like your typical thriller. Nice guy Nick Dunne's gorgeous, all-star wife Amy Dunne has gone missing, with few clues as to her disappearance. Is Amy dead? Kidnapped? And does Nick, who continues to act suspiciously, have something to do with her disappearance?<br /><br />Told in alternating point of views between Nick's present tense narration and a series of diary entries written by Amy during year leading up to her disappearance , the novel focuses on these questions while slowly upping the suspense.<br /><br />Over the course of the first few hundred pages, we learn that the Dunne's marriage, picture perfect from the outside, was progressively failing. The outwardly cheery Nick, it seemed, was rapidly losing patience with the high-strung Amy; whose disappearance he continues to seem careless about. Even Amy herself, it appears, was feeling distant and nervous about her husband.<br /><br />Did Nick kill Amy? That is the primary question that keeps the reader turning the pages for the first half of the book.<br /><br />However, the second half is far more complicated. Without revealing too much, I can only say that half way through, this somewhat conventional seeming thriller takes a major twist.<br /><br />Does it work? Yes and no. In the hands of a lesser writer, Gone Girl could have turned to to be an incredibly disappointing book. Though I hardly consider myself to be an expert at predicting future plot twists, I saw this one coming a mile away, and groaned a bit when it happened. This is my biggest complaint against Gone Girl--that it partially fails as a thriller, a mystery novel. Often these sorts of novels--in which a murder or other mysterious even takes place at the beginning--part of the joy involved is learning what \\"really happened.\\" However, in this case, what \\"really happened\\" is both somewhat obvious, and (for me, at least) an incredible anti-climax.<br /><br />And yet, despite these issues, Gillian Flynn is able to make it work. Because if Gone Girl fails miserably as a conventional thriller, it succeeds brilliantly as a character study, a piece of psychological portraiture. If the mystery at the novels heart starts you reading this book, it will be the subtle, brilliant psychological portraits of the novels protagonists that will keep you hooked.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'd recommend this book, with a few reservations. First, don't come expecting a traditional thriller--for this novel to be one with a neat little mystery at its heart, that will be gradually resolved, and only fully revealed on the last pages. Furthermore, for those who enjoy stories with pat, satisfying ending where all heroes triumph and all villains get their just desserts, you are apt to be disappointed here.<br /><br />However, for anyone who enjoys deep characterization, subtle psychological portraits, and witty riffs on our current culture of self-help and fluid identities, I'd strongly recommend giving Gone Girl a try.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is a great game that u can play to pass the time, good for long waits in the doctors office!
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|I really  loved this book it was very interesting hearing the meaning of different flowers and it was wrapped up in a nice story I did not want the book to end
0064431789|4.0|This is a clever little story that's imaginative and enjoyable. The artwork is awesome. I would recommend it for any child's library.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had read a lot of written articles and advertisements for The Hunger Games as I was trying to figure out what they were all about.  Satisfied that I was pretty sure I was going to like them, I ordered the trilogy for my Kindle. I must say, I could not put the \\"book\\" down.  I read all 3 in a matter of 1 1/2 weeks.<br />  EXCELLENT ! I love to escape to a different \\"world\\" sometimes, don't you?
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Some of the lines were, I'll say, less than awe-inspiring...but if you're just looking for an hour and a half of mindless entertainment, it's a good flick.  The bits where the original 21 Jumpstreet actors reprise their roles are actually pretty funny!
B008OM0M4U|1.0|I've liked every other Sasha BC endeavor. Here, if you saw the trailer, you saw the funny parts of this movie, though I can only rightfully comment on the first half. By the time of the painfully unfunny and pointless funeral home scene, I was so bored, I went back to balancing my checkbook.<br />You have been warned!<br />God, is this movie boring!
B007N0REX6|2.0|Slash is a great guitarist and Myles is amazing in Alter Bridge, but this album in a whole is really quite boring.  It's too similar to G 'n' R.  Even in the first track it sounds like Myles is trying to sound like Axl.  Also, why do three of the tracks have the drumstick countdown (sorry, I can't think of the actual term at the moment) at the beginning?  I can see one track having it, but it's kind of lame to do three.  I just wasn't amazed by this album at all.  It's  mediocre.
0345803485|2.0|If this is what an \\"erotic\\" bestseller is all about...there's a whole lot of women who must have never read a Good one before....because seriously...this is not a \\"good\\" one. Just because there are chains, whips, and \\"toys\\" involved..does not mean it's erotic. In fact, you honestly don't need any of those \\"things\\" to have a novel be erotic ...if it is well written!!<br /><br />Amusing, yes. There really isn't any \\"story\\" to speak of. And PLEASE...tell me why such a big deal is made of the ages of these people when the media speaks of this story. For goodness sake...they are both in their 20's!!! An older man???? NOT!!! Must surely be folks who didn't actually bother to read this thing.<br /><br />But seriously....if you want an \\"erotic' novel...that is actually wonderfully written and would put this one to shame...you need to read BUTTERFLY by Kathryn Harvey. It's not a new book, so you won't find all the bantering going on between people and their blackberry's and computers. But there's an actual \\"real\\" storyline beautifully written along with \\"real\\" erotic scenes. Now...that would be a book worth being a best seller!!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|the game is addictive but freezes n breaks up a lot now not so much in the beginning also have to figure how to get out of game. adult supervision recommended just for purchasing items.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|OK...silly title that misleads you to thinking that this is going to be a rather dumb campy try at a vampire pic....NOT. I was happily surprised by this one. Yes...silly is what I expected...but not what I got. What I got was a really surprisingly well written, well acted, almost believeable twist on history!!<br />I walked away from the movie with a bit of surprise on my face...and a smile. Yes..LOVED it.<br />I had not read the book...and honestly, didn't even know of the book..so I was not comparing it to anything...and it didn't disappoint.<br />Look past the title (although your friends will laugh when you say you saw this one, yes, yes they will) and go see it. You will be happily surprised. I NEED to own this movie.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|I really like the songs on here and like the option to have the explicit language....love the cover photo :)

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Bought this on a whim and am SO glad I did!  Awesome book - wish part II was out already.  Just one statement to the author, \\"I will wait a year for a GOOD book, please don't join the mainstream and push out crap!\\"  Stay your course as you are a fantastic writer!
B004EPYZT4|3.0|I have loved the Conan character ever since I was a boy in New York in 1957 on the farm at 8 years old.  I saved my pennies and nickels and bought paper back books and went away to adventure land.  This New guy from Game of Thrones is no Arnold, but he is ok.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|To be honest the first reason why I read the book was because of its cover. I know, don't judge a book by its cover but i did, and I'm glad I did. If I Stay is one of the most well written books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down after I started reading it. I always believed that when a book make you cry, like literally, it is amazing. I love everything about it. I would really really recommend it.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Easy to figure out.  Addictive and fun to play for all ages. My son and I are both in love with om nom. He is such a cute character. We also like his reactions when he gets the candy or not. The music is also good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|totally worth getting my children love it the whole family loves it at first I thought not but then I got because it looked kool
0307744434|5.0|There are some books that get tagged as YA or middle grade just because they have YA or middle grade characters. Sometimes that makes sense, but sometimes you have to tread carefully because of adult themes or other unsettling content. I'm thinking along the lines of, say, Robert Peck's \\"A Day No Pigs Would Die\\", which has a great deal of realistic, rough farming animal scenes that many parents find very unnerving.<br /><br />  On the other hand you get books that sort of drift into the adult category, even though they are great YA and middle grade reads. I'm thinking of Rebecca Stead's \\"When You Reach Me\\", and similar beautifully crafted books that don't have the usual YA or middle grade hook.<br /><br />  \\"Night Circus\\" seems to fall into this latter category. No violence or sex, but a sophisticated plot that that is reasonably easy to follow, some memorable writing, and great craftsmanship. This seems like the kind of book that a younger reader could enjoy as a literary, as opposed to adventure or fantasy, treat. Maybe I'm overstating it a bit, since some readers found the book dull or uninteresting, but I think for the right reader this book could be very engaging.<br /><br />  That's especially so because it does seem to fit comfortably among the creepy/cool circus books that I've particularly enjoyed. It owes a bit to Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", but it also echoes Kate Milford's \\"The Boneshaker\\", Neal Shusterman's \\"Full Tilt\\", Jonathan Howard's \\"Johannes Cabal the Necromancer\\" and Brooke Stevens \\"The Circus of the Earth and the Air\\", all of which have a magical, gothic, or creepy atmosphere tied by great writing into a the circus metaphor.<br /><br />  So, not your standard fare, but well worth a look for a young reader.
B007P06DOK|5.0|I was born in 1984. I was raised during the dawn of the CD era, and when my parents first got a CD player, this was one of the first albums they bought. They played it to death, over and over again, and my younger self couldn't get enough of it. I can't fathom how many times I asked my dad to play \\"Call Me Al\\" and \\"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\\" again.<br /><br />I bought this today at Cheapo Records here in Austin, Texas. It sat, unopened, in a resale bin, as though someone had gotten it as a gift and never bothered listening because they already had it. What caught my eye was the sticker touting its 25th anniversary, and the fact that it had been remastered with some bonus tracks (alternate versions of some of the songs).I thought: \\"Well, my copy is scuffed up and doesn't sound good when burned to my itunes, maybe it's time for an upgrade.\\"<br /><br />What an upgrade it is! It sounds vibrant, clear, and much like the recent Beatles remasters, reveals aspects to the music that I never heard on the original printing. The drums resonate, the trumpets and accordions form a wall of sound, and Simon's vocals are crystal clear.<br /><br />I notice some folks complaining on here that the album sounds too loud. I think that's because the original was recorded to disc at a time when the technology was new, and the loudness and clarity of the original recording lost quality when translated to CD. Regardless, I don't care. It sounds fantastic, and I'm experiencing it again in a new light.<br /><br />This album is a masterpiece, combining the songwriting brilliance of Paul Simon with the sounds of South African music, with a dose of classic American Nashville sound. It's one of my favorite albums of all time, period. This remaster does it a great justice.<br /><br />As for the haters on here: \\"Get these mutts away from me. I don't find this stuff amusing anymore.\\"
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game. it take alot of skill to play.  lol I do love the fact that it gets hard as u go . new players come in to play as well which makes the game more fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and addicting. lots of items to get. lots of fun to play. keeps you coming back. fun animal animations, too.

B006T5GTK0|4.0|Finished up streaming this Aussie shot film about the Japanese in Malaysia circa 1942 . It is historically interesting and informative . I was formerly unaware of the treatment the English and other caucasian folks (women in particular) were subjected to during those times . A good war time picture fused to an interesting romance is well portrayed here . All the various peoples (including the Japanese) are depicted faily and with well shaded humanity . First time i'd seen Peter Finch outside the film NETWORK . Interestingly enough , about twenty years earlier to the year i believe . Check it out if you're of a mind...Ben
B008BM9L72|5.0|This was the perfect purchase - The book really got you in after chapter 7 and you could keep reading right until the end - not really a book that you want to put down.  Gets you in straight away and keeps you there until the end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! I get bored rather easy but this has kept my attention so far. My only complaint is that I wish we could buy more levels like you can with apple app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is the most fantastic, addicting puzzle game ever, everyone in my family plays it, I play it all day, and I play it everywhere. its a great game to help you deal with long waits and slow days. I recommend it to everyone, and even complete strangers have seen us play it and said it looked really fun. get this game
B001N1DPDE|4.0|There's not much I can say that hasn't been said hundreds of times already in the 300+ other reviews.<br /><br />This knife is strong, VERY strong.  It has the thickest spine of any blade I've ever seen, cavalry sabers included.  This knife has an excellent sheath, and the clasp is very crisp and strong.  It won't be falling out of the sheath any time soon, trust me.<br /><br />The blade can handle any abuse you can give it.  It's durability is matched only by AKM/AK-47 bayonets which I am firm in the belief are indestructible.  You can push one of those through a cinder block wall and the tip won't be damaged.<br /><br />The knife does have some drawbacks, however.  One of these is that due to the massively thick spine, it's hard to sharpen the knife to a good edge.  I'll never be able to shave my arm hair with one of these like I can with my Victorinox or even my Cold Steel shovel.  For this knife's intended use, however, this isn't a problem.  What IS a problem is that the grip is very slick and essentially offers no grip.  The knife feels clumsy with the default grip and honestly doesn't feel very safe.  With the aftermarket Micarta grips, however, this knife truly does become a Companion.

B00004LN16|5.0|In my opinion, this is better than Ballbreaker. Granted its not as heavy, but the songs are just better to me. This is probably their most bluesy album to date and thats not a bad thing at all.<br /><br />Stiff Upper Lip 5/5 - Best song on here, very energetic. Love the riff, how could youn not like the riff? My interpretation of this song is, its either about someone keeping a stiff upper lip, or it could be another sex song. It seems like both to me, i.e. \\"I shoot from the hip\\".<br /><br />Meltdown 5/5 - Another great bluesy song. Love the riff. To me the riffs are the things that stand out the most on this album. Another sex song.<br /><br />House of Jazz 4/5 - Pretty good song, it seems like its almost about a strip club. Maybe.<br /><br />Hold Me Back 5/5 - Love this little simple badass riff. Another sex song.<br /><br />Safe in New York City 5/5 - This song was banned from the radio because of 9/11. Not sure why, all it does is mention new york. It seems like this song is about a woman that a man meets in New York. Another sex song.<br /><br />Can't Stand Still 5/5 - Kind of similar to Hold Me Back. Not sure which is better, there both really good. I think its about a man who just loves to party, he cant stand still.<br /><br />Can't Stop Rock and Roll 5/5 - Love the guitar over the chorus. It's pretty much about the same thing as Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, that rock will never die.<br /><br />Satellite Blues 5/5 - Very good, simple song. Nice riff and chorus. It's about a man whos trying to watch porn on the tv and the satellite is screwing up.<br /><br />Damned 3/5 - Probably the worst on here, not bad but not great. It's about the army.<br /><br />Come and Get It 4/5 - I love the guitar over the pre-chorus for some reason. Another sex song.<br /><br />All Screwed Up 5/5 - Love the riff, it kind of reminds me of Vietnow by Rage Against the MAchine. Another sex song.<br /><br />Give It Up 4/5 - Best part is the chorus. I think its about someone getting into fights.<br /><br />All in all a fantastic album. Better than Ballbreaker. Buy IT!!!!
B001BJ690Y|3.0|When will Amazon ever separate reviews of BluRay discs from those of the Standard Definition DVDs? When will most reviewers stop writing book report summaries of the plot and their opinions of the acting. If I am interested in buying a blu ray DVD it is because I have already seen the movie and liked it and may already have it on a Standard DVD and want to know of the quality of the BD transfer.<br /><br />I do have Kill Bill vol 1 on a Standard Def version and have just bought the Blu Ray version.  As a movie, 5 stars.  As a Blu Ray, only 3 and lucky to get that.  The standard dvd had DTS 5.1 audio and DTS audio has always been good. The blu ray version has  lossless PCM audio which is very good.  However, despite good use of the front sound stage, especially for the audio score, there is very little use of the rears when there really could have been, most specifically when our heroine is fighting the Crazy 88s who have surrounded her in the club.  There should have been tons of directional discreet audio coming out there but there wasn't.  I do have a very high end esoteric home theater so I consider myself more attuned to the audio directionality than most but was disappointed in the audio editing.<br /><br />The video transfer was a huge disappointment.  While I saw no artifacting, aliasing or even grain for that matter, the entire film looks, for the most part, dull.  This is one of those  transfers where there really is no difference between the video palate from the Standard Def version to the Blu Ray version.  There are far too many scenes in this movie where the colors should be popping yet they stay in the kernel.  And that is the reason why I gave this 5 star movie only 3 stars. Even the extras are the same on Blu Ray as opposed to the Standard DVD .  Bottom line, if you don't already have Kill Bill vol 1 on DVD, then, of course buy the Blu Ray version as they are always inexpensively priced.  If you do already have it, you really won't see or hear much difference.<br />Tomorrow I look at Kill Bill Vol 2.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksifference.<br />Tomorrow I look at Kill Bill Vol 2.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Word on the street is that this series is called \\"Mommy Porn\\".  Well, there is a lot of graphic scenes, however, this is supplementary to the bigger picture and is used as a catalyst to drive the story forward.  The book is well-written, but can be a bit redundant with the over-use of the same phrases and descriptions, however, if you are a student of human nature/behavior, this is a very interesting read.  As the book(s) unfold, (the three in the series), you begin to understand how a person's background, upbringing, and experiences impact, in this particular case, the leading man ~ Christian Grey.  It's a good beginning to a complete story that shows us that no matter how messed up someone seems, with time, love, understanding, patience, and acceptance, none of us has to be a victim of the past.  Highly recommended!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I am loving this headset, everything I hoped for but a few things for some reason my Firefox only plays sound out of right speaker but if I put on surround it works in both in chrome surround and stereo both work in both speakers I think this is an issue with flash not the headphones from what iv gathered with this issue looking up on the web, also its kinda annoying that I have to manually switch my playback device from speakers to g930 headset when I want to go back from one to the other.. it doesn't just recognize I turned off the headset and go back to speakers I have to manually go into sound settings and change it.. annoying even with new drivers doesn't just auto recognize and do it automatically, not sure if this is an issue im gonna have to live with or if Logitech even cares to look into it, I do love the headset though just wish more information was out on these problems.. also I read allot about people sending back the headset over the sound issues in the browsers like the one I just explained.. this is not a hardware problem this is a software issue with flash, this only happens when playing flash videos also read in Logitech forums people that work at Logitech giving the standard reply to this issue as a problem with the headset and that the person should rma and it send it back, silly that more info isn't out on this sound problem with flash, people sending back the headset cause someone at Logitech is telling them its a hardware problem. I don't believe that, all the movies and games I play all work just find with stereo and surround but in browser and flash does this one sided thing and for some reason not in both browsers chrome is dif than Firefox on how it handles it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps your undivided attention from the first page. It is so interesting. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, the book takes such an unexpected twist. This book you will not be able to put down. The author did an amazing job of writing it and all the charactars come to life. You can see each one of them so clearly. I laughed out loud a couple of times and I have never done that with a book before. It is probably the best book I have read this year.

B0058YPG1G|1.0|For whatever reason this season of the show on DVD did not contain closed captions nor English subtitles.  I knew there would be no subtitles, but I expected captioning to be there.  Being hard of hearing made watching this a challenge without subtitles.  Buyer beware on this if you need the subtitles.  I watched seasons 1 - 3 and they had captions.  And no, my dvd is not connected via hdmi.  This is an old dvd player connected to an old CRT type television.

0451169514|4.0|Stephen King's It is a very good and compelling story.  Sure, it's riddled with the typical Stephen King cliches such as being set in Maine with a bully and a small group of outcast kids, and not to mention, the self-inserted hero who resembles King himself.<br /><br />But despite the apparent short comings this is still a very good, very disturbing story.  The story is a little long winded but in the span of the story you grow attached to each of the characters and start to care about them and to stand with them.

Abraham Van Helsing, PROFESSOR ABRAHAM Van Helsing was a German man living in Amsterdam and with a Dutch name, who lead the band of heroes in defeating Dracula in the original novel by Bram Stoker. He was a wise, older man, not an action hero, not an angel with amnesia. The fact that he was NOT a youthful action hero was kind of the point. In fact the character most like Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing (the Texan, Quincey Morris) was the one who DIED in the Dracula novel while PROFESSOR Van Helsing survived. It was his cunning and wisdom that defeated Dracula, not a rapid fire cross bow and Dresden Files-esque duster.<br /><br />2. MAMMALS DO NOT LAY EGGS!!! WHY would female vampires, who used to be human, who take the form of bats (a MAMMAL) lay eggs!??<br /><br />3. Why would God erase Gabriel's memory to punish him? How is it a punishment if you don't know you're being punished or why?<br /><br />4. Why give Dracula the name Vladislaus Dracula (what the Historical Vlad The Impaler signed his name as on documents) yet turn him into a gypsy with a birth age and date of death that don't add up. (Seriously, it claims he's in his twenties when you do the math. Richard Roxburough is NO twenty year old), just so that he can incestuously go after a gypsy descendant?<br /><br />5. Why did Van Helsing show pity toward the Frankenstein creature but not The Wolfman or Jekyll. The reasoning is the creature didn't choose to be what he is but Jekyll never intended to create Hyde and the werewolf never asked to be bitten. It. does. Not. make. Sense.<br /><br />6. Why would the Vatican want to destroy an intelligent and apparently non-violent being?<br /><br />7. I'm tired of the new cliche of action films (and anime) using The Vatican as some covert group of spies and assassins going after supernatural threats.<br /><br />8. WHY would a werewolf bite kill Dracula? If you read the novel he LIKED wolves, he called them the children of the night and went out of his way to calm and pet the trapped wolves at the London zoo. He can take wolf form himself! He was in the form of a wolf or \\"large dog\\" when he got off the Demeter in Whitby. Has no one actually read the novel!??
B007IXWKUK|3.0|To be honest, this book is not great and not too bad either. It's a fast, easy read but very similar to book one in terms of language. In fact, so many phrases and words are reused and continually recycled. Like book one, the plot is not very developed or realistic. It is also very predictable; there isn't much in terms of suspense or being a real page turner. That said, it still is an entertaining book.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King's It is a very good and compelling story.  Sure, it's riddled with the typical Stephen King cliches such as being set in Maine with a bully and a small group of outcast kids, and not to mention, the self-inserted hero who resembles King himself.<br /><br />But despite the apparent short comings this is still a very good, very disturbing story.  The story is a little long winded but in the span of the story you grow attached to each of the characters and start to care about them and to stand with them.<br /><br />There is nothing more disturbing than Pennywise the clown portrayed by the fantastically disturbing Tim Curry.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I have used this product to sharpen a vanadium stainless steel kitchen knife, and it is nearly razor sharp. Totally sufficient for a thin knife cutting vegetables and meat.<br /><br />However, I tried to use this for my KA-BAR next gen, and the angle is much shallower than the 20 degree (each side) of the KA-BAR. As a result, I need to take much more metal off the KA-BAR if I am to use this shallower angle.<br /><br />If your KA-BAR is still reasonably sharp, and you wish to touch up the edge, PLEASE use a whetstone. It will save you hours of grinding away at excess material. Plus I'm not sure that a utility knife is meant to have such a shallow angle, since it might be used for heavier duty applications, like chopping branches, etc.<br /><br />I will likely purchase a [[ASIN:B000QFZH20 Redi Edge Sharpeners Tactical Pro Knife Sharpener Redi Edge]]in the 40 degree inclusive flavour to finish sharpening my KA-BAR.
B00004RJ74|1.0|I feel that this is one of those films that I feel is a part of the contemporary polarization.  Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines.  It's one extreme or the other.  No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious.  Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that.
B00846TTDG|5.0|The narration through out the movie leaves you spell bound. While such a horrid war is raging you are left feeling awe and love. I have watched this movie twice and have since purchased it. Wow, amazing and speechless. A must watch whether you are a war buff or not.

145210655X|5.0|I love this book! It's funny, and witty. It's attempt of Vader as an actual normal Dad is hysterical, and the art is descent.
B005LAIH9A|3.0|I enjoyed the original American Pie movie. The two sequels were disappointing, but American Reunion held promise. The high school reunion concept presented an opportunity to end the American Pie franchise on a high note by bringing back the cast one last time. Furthermore, a couple of the story lines (Jim and Michelle's struggle as young parents and Jim's dad) had the potential to inject heartfelt substance to the film.<br />Instead, this film reverted back to the familiar humor of raunch and sex. This time the formula is not effective. The characters are simply too old for these over-the-top situations. It was also a challenging task to work in all of the American Pie characters into the flow of the movie. To be fair, I enjoyed every scene with Eugene Levy.<br />It has been 13 years since the first American Pie. Maybe I expected this movie to grow up too.
1608871045|5.0|Nice book, especially if you like back story, and paper props! Great for a \\"Nolan\\" Batman fan! I like the joker cards the best!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love the graphic. Love how it bubbles when charging. Just plain love it. GREAT job!! Keep up the good work -  your customers appreciate it!
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|Although the Blu-Ray edition is not that much better than the non-Blu-Ray CD, if you really love this movie (and I do) then you have to get it. Even if it's only marginally better, a true lover of 60s (whatstheword) will have to own it.
B001TH16DI|4.0|So, the blu-ray discs/movies are great -- and I can't complain about the price -- but who designed this uglier than sin, destined to get wrecked packaging?  The ghostly images of the cast on the individual cases look like a first year design student's failed project.  They, and the box, are sterile and ugly. And the clear plastic cover for the box is simply an annoyance that is guaranteed to come apart, crack, or otherwise get ruined somehow down the line.  Top marks for the contents -- but the packaging is a mess.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was blown away on how large it is. Feels the whole screen on my Kindle Fire. I didn't have to use my reading glasses at all.  I gave it 5 stars!!!
B0019UGYK0|5.0|What does it mean to be true to yourself? Cool Hand Luke. Simple and to the point: the jail flick of all jail flicks. This one came first. Cool Hand Luke starring Paul Newman. An American icon in one of his defining roles.<br />Luke is an outcast. No matter what happens, he is not going to play by the rules. Not on the streets. Not on the chain gang. There are no special effects here. No hype and no gimmicks whatsoever. You do get treated to the sweet sounds of Harry Dean Stanton and his guitar. Cool Hand Luke is 100% heart. Its all about not giving in no matter what. Its about never letting the world break you down. If you are one that is familiar with these themes: check this one out. It is as classic as it gets.

B00003CXIP|5.0|I ordered this movie for my dads girlfriend and it arrived on time in great condition and still in the package. im so glad i got this. She used to watch this with her mom but her mom passed away so im glad i could buy this for her.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This screwdriver is brilliant! I finally just bought it, and am glad I did. First, let me say I'm in my second year of college (still living at home). Then, let me say that I awaited my sonic screwdriver with excitement, and was grinning ear-to-ear when it arrived. So I had big expectations. For the most point, the screwdriver didn't disappoint.<br /><br />It makes two different sonic-ing noises, just barely distinguishable, which is fun. The light and sound together are fantastic, and you can have the neck down for 'low power' or up for 'high power.' Your imagination makes the other hundreds+ settings...except for wood, of course. (That reminds me, I really need to get a setting for wood, it's embarrassing.) The regular pen works wonderfully (black ink, which I prefer, yay!).<br /><br />After receiving this in the mail, I proceeded to sonic most of the house, much to my family's amusement. This toy makes me feel like a kid again.<br /><br />The only downsides are yes, the pen nib comes off fairly easily. But it's not that big a deal. And yes, if you throw it around or step on it, it'll probably break, and I don't like to let my five-year-old sister out of sight with it for fear she'll break it. (I think I'll buy her one for her birthday or Christmas, she can do whatever she wants with her own screwdriver.) Yes, you have to use a real screwdriver to put in the batteries, but said batteries seem to be holding up well (and I use this a lot...). The cap on the slider that you take off to unscrew the screwdriver (never thought I'd say that...) fell off and got lost while I was playing with it one time, but it looks fine without it and isn't that big a deal. My biggest issue was that the invisible ink pen nib was dry when it arrived (I suppose just because the product is a few years old), and only worked very weakly for a short while. No amount of water could revive it. But, I didn't get it expressly to be an invisible ink pen, and the blacklight will still work with other invisible ink pens. So, for all those cons, I just knock off one star. Just barely.<br /><br />'Cause I DO love this product. And my siblings all do, too. I've gotten great joy out of finding ways to fool my family into thinking that the screwdriver actually DID unlock/lock or turn on/off something. Definitely recommended.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I really enjoy the simplistic design and the fact that it seems to be both fashion forward and designed to make use as easy as possible.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book as much as the other two books.  Great series of books to read.  A must read series of books.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|An excellent, compelling read. I couldn't put it down and neither could I wait to read the next book. I read all 3 books in just over a week.<br />My teenage son is now also hooked and is working his way through the trilogy!
B00631VJIC|4.0|I don't know how the producers of Sons of Anarchy pick the music to go in each episode, but they nail it every time. Not only are the songs spot-on for the situation, but the remade versions are incredibly well done. Most of these songs are already classics, so being asked to remake them must be a daunting task, but every one of these bands steps up and delivers in a big way. The CD is an intense listening experience even if you aren't a fan of the Sons.
B008133DO8|5.0|My father in-law introduced us to this series.  It is simply entertaining.  Quirky but intelligent.  Shows flaws of characters ..... and shows things about the characterize they are only starting to realize about themselves.  Smart
0452287022|4.0|Although the book is not perfect, the books binding is not broken, you can read it, there is not writing in it, and it is in good conditions. Plus, with the extra information in the book, it gives you a better understanding to the story!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't feel that this book had much of a storyline at all. The girl was pathetic and the man was disgusting and disrespectful. I don't think this is a scenario anyone should be fantasizing about.
B0000214F0|5.0|If you like history, the Roman Empire, lots of hot brunettes, or crazy dictators, this is for you.<br /><br />I like ALL of the above, so I knew I had to buy \\"Caligula\\".<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.<br />It tells the story of Caligula in all his non-glory & insanity.<br />While slightly swaying away from the true story of the real Caligula, it does give an account of some of what really happened in his life.  It shows the crazy relationships he had with his family members, friends and peers; his maniacal commands and choices relating to his subjects and citizens.<br />The guy was 'interesting' to say the least.<br /><br />The acting is good as there are some very talented actors/actresses in the lineup.<br />For those of you who like Penthouse girls and lots of nudity, both are here, lol.<br />There are cool locales for many of the scenes, and the camera work is interesting and well shot for the time.<br /><br />If an anything-goes movie about Caligula is your wanting, buy this.<br /><br />I thought it was a good movie and consider it to be in the 4.5*+ range, so I give it the max.

B003G4W49C|3.0|It has a good story with a number of fascinating ideas. However it was a little psychologically naive. A child no matter how high an IQ will have the emotional wherewithal to cope with the challenges Ender encounters. Nevertheless it was fun to read.

081297381X|2.0|...if, you can get past the author's enormous ego and love for himself, that is exuded on nearly every page.<br /><br />The book delves deeply into how institutions fail (almost always) to accurately predict the future, whether in economics or elsewhere. This theorizing is probably worth at least a four star rating. In some ways it is revolutionary thinking.<br /><br />Where the book falls down is in the fact that Taleb is so in love with himself and his ideas, that he turns off the reader on virtually every page by telling us how great he is. Only a handful of people throughout human history, maybe three or four, are great \\"empirical skeptics\\" like he is that see the world for what it really is... What would we do without Poincaire, and Mandelbrot, and Taleb? Oh, no. We'd be in a world of trouble. Oh no.<br /><br />All the rest of us are complete idiots according to Taleb, from Plato on up to the present day. Oh, and that includes all thinkers, all agencies involved in trying to forecast future growth for society. Despite the fact that human civilization has progressed without Taleb's help for thousands of years, you get the distinct impression that he writes this off as just a fluke of nature, enormously unlikely good fortune on our behalf.<br /><br />He doesn't just condemn philosophers however. He condemns all of economics, all study of history, all of the life and physical sciences (except for physics), all of the humanities, and all of academics in general.<br /><br />If we would just listen to him, the messiah of the future, we'd all be so much better off. We'd see history more clearly, and we'd have much fatter bank accounts and more people at parties to intimidate with our lofty ideas.<br /><br />The thing that turned me off the most about this book is that the author seems to assume that every economist, politician, scientist and academician involved in trying to predict the future is completely blind to the fact that their predictions might be just a bunch of dog poop. They do know this. But they try anyway, to improve upon the process.<br /><br />AND, Taleb assumes that the common man or woman is a complete idiot that buys into these forecasts. We all know that the experts often don't know what they are talking about. That is, uh, common sense, is it not?<br /><br />I forced myself through this book to page 298, and took copious notes. The author said this was the end of his diatribe, so I stopped there (though the book does in fact continue to page 444).<br /><br />The greatest weakness I see in this book is that the author spends page after page condemning all this theorizing about how to predict the future and account for the unexpected, Black Swans, yet he fails to see that he is largely doing the same thing. He theorizes on and on, and offers very little in the way of solutions to implementing his ideas. He is what he condemns.<br /><br />The greatest strength in this book is that it very thoroughly outlines the key ways in which human beings/the human mind tricks itself into thinking that the future is predictable and the past is known. This is very important, fundamental knowledge. And I applaud the author for spelling it out for us. We need to know our limitations if we are to find a way past them.<br /><br />But if you make it to the end of this book, odds are you are going to have a fairly negative opinion of this man as being something like a child in a school yard screaming out his ideas to everyone, with no one listening, telling everyone how great he is and why you should all listen to him.<br /><br />Its very hard to take that sort of thing seriously, even if the temper tantrum has some serious basis in fact.<br /><br />Taleb needs to go talk to his fictitious author of renown, Yevgenia Krasnova, and ask her for some advice on how to write a book where you don't offend your reader on nearly every page.<br /><br />Otherwise, regardless of the value of his ideas, the thing is of value only to stoke thecampfire at night and roast some marshmallows.

0910316252|5.0|This is written to be readable by non-physicists and explains all technical points very clearly and with very little mathematics. However, it is also very complete, detailed and well balanced. It relates the development of quantum physics starting with Plank's black body radiation law. It is not until two thirds of the way through the book that it actually discusses the debates between Bore and Einstein, and that is as it should be, because that only makes sense in the context of what they and others had contributed and thought before the full theory was formulated. It is important, for instance, that it was Einstein who introduced probability into quantum physics in the first place (so that was not his main objection to the Copenhagen Interpretation).<br />It relates that Bore pointed out to Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle is a general property of waves, and therefore easy to see from Schrodinger's point of view. This has been overlooked in other books I have read. Here it is explained with simple diagrams, without assuming the knowledge of Fourier transforms that the physicists of that time presumably had.<br /><br />Though Einstein was completely wrong in doubting qm, his thought experiments were valuable. The one where Einstein forgot to take general relativity into account, as this book points out, served to show that macroscopic objects obey the rules of qm. This had not been clear in Bore's ideas. It is still useful; for example, it tends to rule out Roger Penrose's idea that gravity washes out qm effects when a body reaches a certain weight.<br />The EPR one really did show a fatal flaw in the Copenhagen Interpretation, though not in qm itself.<br /><br />The book fails to warn us early on that both Bore and Einstein were wrong in their own ways, each trying to retain something of classical physics. (It seems to me that the one who was closest to right was Schrodinger.)<br />This book seems to me to be already somewhat outdated. When the author says \\"reality\\", he, as in older books, means classical reality, and he tends to equate qm with Copenhagen some of the time. Schrodinger and Everett saw reality as being the state vector or wave function, and they realized that macroscopic objects can exist in quantum superpositions. They realized that whatever one says about quantum mechanics, classical physics is no more than an approxiation to it. This latter view has become dominant in recent years. He does mention the Many Worlds Interpretation at the end, but since the book is largely for people who are not already familiar with such views, they should be presented early on, or even used as a standard by which Bore's and Einstein's positions are judged.<br />With this one reservation, it is an excellent book.<br /><br />I add one more point: All these books say that the Copenhagen Interpretation was dominant until recent decades. However, from the time I first read about qm in the early 1950s in Fred Hoyl's ''Frontiers of Astronomy'' through 20 years of intensively studying and using qm (and taking one philosophy of science class) to converting a scattering formula from Messiah and other qm books to electromagnetic waves to solve a radar problem, I never heard the idea that there is a physical process called wave function collapse. Everyone assumed that qm is just the way the world is and that is all the interpretation one needs, the probabilities must come out of the mathematics in one way or another. I only encountered wave function collapse when I started editing and reading Wikipedia. I encountered Many Worlds when I then read Everett's article. So Schrodinger's idea that the wave function is reality has been much more common than these books say. The reason the interpretation is not often discussed is that it is simply that classical physics is only an approximation.  What philosophy is supposed to teach us is how to ask the right question.  The question is not how does quantum mechanics lead to probabilities; it is how do classical approximations lead to probabilities.; it is how do classical approximations lead to probabilities.
B003VANOFY|4.0|These headphones are not bad at all. Very comfortable. Your ears shouldn't even touch, if not, barely the cups. They rest on your head and create a dome-like environment over your ears. 7.1 virtual surround sound is pretty good. Makes playing games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent that much scarier. The mic is pretty good, flexible, and you can even set the sidetone volume in the software so you can hear your own voice through the headset. Noise isolating headphones like these can cause you to yell when talking but the sidetone settings can somewhat eliminate that and the muffled sound of your voice. I knocked off a star for two reasons. First being the construction of the headphones make me afraid of them breaking. So far I've had them since April and they are still in one piece *knocks on wood* but I've been extremely careful with them. They are mostly made out of plastic. The second reason is occasionally these headphones will lose signal multiple times out of nowhere and the settings (my sidetone settings) reset. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it can be very annoying. The range is pretty good. My bedroom is in the basement and I am able to go upstairs and still be connected unless I got too far. In the basement I can pretty much go almost everywhere and keep a signal. I recommend these headphones for those that have gaming laptops that don't have the high-end sound cards that you can buy for desktops.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|Luckily it was a weekend when I started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, because after a few chapters I could not just put it down - all of Sunday went by in Gone Girl's world.<br />This is a great crime fiction, though a very original take on the genre.  So many sudden and unexpected changes, the characters well drawn, and increasingly less likeable as you get to know them - sorting their opinions of themselves from reality was one of the challenges and delights of this book.<br />You will find no spoilers in this review ... just a recommendation for a great read!
0307887448|2.0|What I was led to believe to be a science fiction novel turned out to be nothing more than a child's book with unnecessary anachronistic pop culture references.<br /><br />The writing is incredibly bland and literal and the plot unfolds in the most predictable of manner. For the most part, the countless 80s pop culture references in the book have nothing to do with anything, perhaps other than to be the only defining characteristic of the book (Whoa! Duran Duran! I listened to them! Best book EVAR!). Considering the novel's serious lack of substance, it's very nearly insulting that the term \\"geeky\\" is frequently used to describe this book.<br /><br />Perhaps it ties in with the current trend of \\"geekiness\\" being hip. Who knows.<br />I give the book 2 stars, and not 1, only because I was actually able to read through to the end.
B00123KEPK|5.0|So if you have ventured this far into the prog rock firmament, then you are probably already a YES fan.  Congratulations.  If, by some bizarre coincidence, you find your way to this review and have never before experienced this album, let me tell you, prepare to have your cerebrum cracked open and let the sky in.  Intensely creative music from another dimension (the 70's) with Eastern religious influence.  Don't let at turn you off...take it as a starting point for a bit of creative genius that no one could have predicted and whom none can replicate, even YES themselves.  This is a bizarre but wonderful discovery, a world of sci fi sounds and oceanic depths that will leave you breathless.  Wow, and wow.  What the heck is this album about anyway?  I'm not sure.  I'd better listen to it again.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a friend and frankly it is not the type of book that I really would pick up and read. Well after about 5 pages I was hooked. I read it voraciously and enjoyed the character development, the lives of the 2 main characters and all those who swirled around them.<br />That this is a \\"supernatural\\" book just fell by the wayside for me as the 2 main characters are so compelling. They are interesting by themselves.<br />I am looking forward to the next installments as frankly I could not put this book down.<br /><br />I recommend it highly but caution to those who do not like history - if you aren't into reading history this might not be your cup of tea. For me it was sheer heaven - thanks for a terrific read

0307346617|5.0|As I've noted before in my reviews, the whole zombie/vampire/werewolf genre really isn't my thing. A relative of mine loves it all, though, and so I often find myself reading outside my own genres--a good thing, really, because it forces one to stretch a little and think about different subjects. This book surprised me by making me like it. The author is a really good writer and his prose is clean and spare, no baggage. The stories, told in the first person by different characters, recount how each person encountered zombies and how they survived. The author has done a really good job of creating a hugely diverse group of characters ranging from doctors and soldiers to kids, politicians, and grifters.  Some of them survived by dumb luck, others by smarts or by another person's sacrifice. The stories rang true and many were really affecting, such as soldiers who were the victims of bad military decisions or ordinary people who didn't know what to do and did something random that worked but sometimes with hard consequences. Since each chapter is another story, this would be a great beach book or a book for people who have to read in quick snatches in a busy life. I truly think this is the best of the whole zombie genre and recommend it both to zombie fans and to those who are just curious about the whole thing.
B001ESZNPY|5.0|Had I picked up this album a few years earlier when it came out, I would not have liked it. But, like Tool said, the idea of selling out is something that we, as fans, have generated in our own minds to justify the different cycles we go through during our lifetimes. This album, while so very different from the first two, slips into the same vein but does it with a level of maturity that I absolutely loved. It's a beautiful mix of the old with the new, and an excellent demonstration of how the group has grown into themselves over the 9 - 10 years since the release of the first self-titled album. Excellent job.
0765365278|5.0|This happens to be the first Brandon Sanderson novel I actually read. I bought a copy of the hardcover of Elantris when it first came out and a copy of the paperback of Mistborn, the first in the Final Empire trilogy (which is now a continuing series) but somehow never got into them. I have a habit of reading a chapter or two of every new book that arrives before deciding mentally when to read it. In this case, I happened to buy the ebook of The Way Of Kings first along with a number of other ebooks for my Kindle. I enjoyed the first few chapters so much I immediately ordered the paperback. Now that I've finished breaking the spine of this massive 1250 page paperback, I wonder if I should have ordered the hardcover instead! If I'm taking a long time to get to the point, it's only to make the point that Brandon Sanderson does NOT take time to get to the point. Few epic fantasies are so terrific straight out the starting gate. I can think of several that take at least the entire first volume to get started then end on a cliff-hanger.<br /><br />The Way of Kings is not such a book. It's a massively detailed, exhaustively plotted, immensely satisfying volume. While obviously not complete in itself, it does present enough story to satisfy even the most demanding reader with enough spectacular story-telling, world-building, character development, and all-round terrific epic narration to fill a trilogy by other authors. The quality of writing, editing, book designing, publishing is so high, it's quite amazing that both the publisher and author are so prolific and yet so good. The closest example I can think of where an author and publisher took a bold plunge to produce an equally ambitious fantasy series of this high standard is Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series, which has not just concluded on schedule but has spawned an equally brilliant spin-off series in collaboration with Ian C. Essslemont, published by Bantam in the UK. In my opinion, Sanderson's WoK (his acronym, not mine, and one that cleverly reminds one of another similar acronym, WoT, which is the other great epic fantasy series he is also writing) rivals and in some ways already aims higher than the Malazan series, even though it's just one book down. That's because Sanderson's approach delves deeper into characters, making them more empathetic, their story arcs more identifiable. And also because his world and magic system is so brilliantly developed to the last detail.<br /><br />WoK is a brilliant epic fantasy by any standards. Coming from an author who is juggling at least one other epic fantasy series of his own (the Final Empire), an YA series (Alcatraz) and the final volumes of the Wheel of Time, to be followed presumably by the last two books in the prequel trilogy as well, this is a superb production. A great vision brilliantly realized. I am a fan of Sanderson now and don't care how long he takes to finish The Stormlight Archive so long as he keeps delivering books as complete and satisfying as this one.(his acronym, not mine, and one that cleverly reminds one of another similar acronym, WoT, which is the other great epic fantasy series he is also writing) rivals and in some ways already aims higher than the Malazan series, even though it's just one book down.

B000F8O4DQ|3.0|Compared to original CD edition it is 4,5db louder, slighly saturated (peaks are chopped). It might be better for listening on a noisy environment, but it has less dynamics. Besides that sound quality and eq of both editions are very similar, new one is barely brighter. Unlike Out Of The Blue in which new edition is clearly worst than the old one, this one doesn't sound bad, but it's not better, I would stick with the old one if it wasn't for the bonus tracks.
B004LWZW6K|4.0|After a long days work this was a movie to watch. Entertaining, funny and a few nudies. Good<br />entertainment for the money.
1451648537|5.0|This was an amazing story! No matter what our opinion is, we cannot discredit Steve Jobs talent and ability to achieve success as a leader in the advancement of technology. I found it interesting how he never gave up trying to accomplish his desires. He had a certain stick-to-itiveness that most people dare attempt.<br /><br />I am not here to criticize his judgments or character in how he dealt with others or speak harshly about how he met his achievements. If you have not read this story and are contemplating reading it, you will not be disappointed. For those that enjoy learning from the experiences of others, this book provides you with plenty of opportunities to do so.<br /><br />I chose to listen to the audio version which I felt was most entertaining because it felt like I was receiving the information first hand. While the majority of the book held my attention, at times, the technical details seemed to drag on. But, overall the book is quite educational.<br /><br />The details described took me through a variety of emotions ranging from sadness to unbelievable and \\"ah ha\\" moments. For instance, I recently purchased an iPad and was thoroughly disappointed that it does not support Adobe Flash. After listening to the book, I finally understand why.<br /><br />Jobs was no doubt a genius! I only wonder what other marvels he would have discovered.
B005HEGW56|2.0|Archer is awful.  He recently played the role of a coach for a sports team, and he is reprisiing that role.  He is just a coach, spouting trite comments and his acting is juvenile.<br /><br />Otherwise, I am a big fan of the other Star Trek series, but this is a real disappointment.
B004LZRSDM|5.0|I must get this technical point out of the way before I say anything else about this DVD. It will NOT play on my DVD player. I had to watch and listen to it on my PC. That was rather disappointing. As for the concert, the music and performances, they were simply fantastic. I was amazed actually, because the music and performances seemed so flawless. This is quite a moving DVD if you have been a long time fan of a-ha or ever been touched by their music. Yes, it is aptly named. They did absolutely end on a high note.
0061906220|5.0|The preschoolers in my class loved this book and could be heard \\"reading\\" it long after story time was over.It contains great literacy concepts and learning tools and can be used repeatedly to teach and re-enforce concepts presented.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have hus started playing these type of games and I have to say this is one of the more entertaining games espeicaly a licensced franchises version
B0010SKUYM|4.0|The book itself is a fun ride right from the start that switches between 1st and 3rd person narrative. The structure is very well constructed and the story is fun too. I'm sure there are a lot of other reviews that gives more insight, but I'd like to talk about something else here which caught me by surprise.<br /><br />I've always loved music, and this book spends a lot of time describing all kinds of music. Although I have never heard of any of the songs played in this book, the intricate details and artful writing really makes for a good read for people who listens to a wide range of different music genres. How I wished to be in the Eolian when \\"The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard\\" was being played!<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me is the occasional slow pacing of his telltale. Sometimes the process of building up to the action drags on for a while, but it's rare and still very entertaining. Highly recommended for those who loves a brilliant story well told!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I am enjoying this game very much when I use Vegas scoring, but I can 't figure out the logic of \\"standard scoring\\",<br />So I don 't have any use for that part of the game.
0345803493|1.0|I didn't think it was possible, but EL James has singlehandedly raped English language with her sophomoric sentence weaving and the most spineless character (Ana Steele) one will ever have a chance of encountering. Someone should take the computer (or the typewriter, pens, pencils or anything that can write) away from this author.
B005USZML4|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  It is a wonderful book for all reading levels from about middle school and up.  I like how John Grisham has started writing a series about one person and it happens to be a teenager.  This is a must read for any fan of John Grisham and this genre of books. My son just started reading it and he loves it.  He just finished the first one in the series and loved it. He is only in the third grade.

030758836X|5.0|The book was great from the start, middle, but not the ending..................... I would love to  have seen it end another way.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Personally, I thought the book was pointless.  It's basically soft porn/erotica, but comes to no conclusion & makes no moral statement; leading one to believe a sequel or two \\"Double Ugh!\\" is to follow; which, of course they do.  Nothing to learn from said book except how to get aroused if one so desires.  The writing is very average, better in some places, worse in others.  Reminds me of a young highschool or freshman college girl's silly fantasy: highly unlikely to really happen in just the way that it does and rather victorian in it's images, more specifically in both main characters' basic morals.  A true sadist is not necessarily as pure as Mr. Grey and not too many college graduates are still virgins unless possibly they're attending a religious institution of higher education.  I'm dismayed that it got on the New York Time's \\"Best Seller\\" list.  What does that say about the dumbing down, in general, of our society?
B0086700CM|3.0|It's entertaining but after awhile it just gets old. If it wasn't free, i probably wouldn't have bought it because there's no cool things in the store. Personally, I think they should update the game and store to make it more interesting. Once you've bought everything, there really is no point in playing anymore.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product was difficult to use when texting. Because of the thick plastic cover it required heavier pressure on the keyboard. The bulky on-off button for the ringer usually would not work.  Not a user friendly product.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book was so intense!  I'm usually not a fan of the epistolary style of writing, but this one is a major exception.  I was a little reluctant because every entry is like the main character hits the reset button on her memory.  The danger would be that the author would spend too much time catching the character up to speed with every entry.  But fear not!  The story moves along fluidly and the tension mounts with every entry.  Like the main character, you don't know who to trust until the end.  I recommend it highly.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|For months I've been hearing about \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and how how it's sparking all sorts of conversation among women, especially the topic of, \\"Would they really want to go into such a dark space with someone?\\"<br /><br />Frankly, I found it way over the top,overly gratuitous and not to mention, the writing left much to be desired. The character of Christian Grey is fabulously handsome and charming, and his twisted manner is at first interesting. However, it got to the point where there was nothing but one graphic encounter after another. It made me wonder, is this all the author has to offer for lack of a solid story line? It's akin to a rock band having all sorts of mad pyrotechnics and visual drama to make up for their lack of live musical talent. I actually lost interest in the book and began to think, \\"Oh, here they go again...this time with a flogger!\\"<br /><br />The reviews for the second installment are far more positive than this first outing, so I may just give it a try. However, unlike the Harry Potter books, or Roger Zelazny's Nine Princes of Amber series, I was not compelled to rush and immediately place the second book onto my Kindle. I'll get around to it when I do. There is no urgency.<br /><br />Yes, Fifty Shades of Grey is a quickie read on the beach. That's my take on it.

B004U8VUUC|2.0|The fact that it's a true story makes it interesting alone - but the plot line, the music, the build us is unfortunately off in a variety of ways. I really wanted to like this movie, but didnt. As a movie, it just falls short. The characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been. Kristen Dunst does a good job - but really the movie (and story) is bizarre, so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out.

B008S4YZCO|3.0|Cute But Slows Down FAST<br />The monsters are adorable, and the gameplay is addictive...at first. But by the end of the first day, my monsters can only fight once per hour - unless I pay, of course. My daughter has been playing a little longer...and her monsters can only battle once per day now. She has lost interest. As much as I am currently enjoying the game, at this rate I will soon lose interest too. By the way...why no free crystal offers for Kindle Fire version?
034580404X|4.0|I really Liked the story line and couldn't put the book down. Don't buy this if you don't want to read about sex. Some of it got boring to me. Over all really enjoyed it.

031620157X|5.0|Will this book be a classic, probably not, but it is fun and entertaining, especially if you are a fan of fairy takes.  The wit and humor Colfer is known for shines through in his first book.

B00094OB1Q|5.0|This by no means the case with Karl Bohm.  It is why I considered him one of the six greatest conductors in the mid<br />1960s. In toto, the majority of his output is four star worthy, but he did record some five star performances. Here is<br />a list of some of Bohm at his best:  Brahms symphonies #s 1 and 2/BPO/DG ca 1957 and 1958; Magic Flute and Cosi/VPO/ 1954-55<br />Abduction/Clemenza/Idomeneo/Dresden 1970s. This 1969 Dresden Fidelio joins them.  It is tight, tough<br />passionate in dramatizing this war between love and power. The Dresden State orchestra is glorious as usual.  The males<br />are convincing,I think,although some find Theo Adam and James King ineffective. Gwyneth Jones was inconsistent in<br />her career but not here-she is blazingly intense and dramatic.  Less sustained beauty than Gundula Janowitz but<br />thoroughly convincing.  Ditto Edith Mathis as Marcelline, but I still prefer Lucia Popp<br />for Bernstein-a vocal an dramatic paragon. I also do not discount Otto Klemperer's performance with Vickers, Ludwig et<br />al-it remains a great interpretation, though five fewer minutes would have helped.

B003C1LGY8|5.0|Always enjoyed listening to Alice in Chains. Facelift, Dirt, Jar of Flies. Dirt is one of my favorite metal albums.<br /><br />I believe this dvd contains all of their videos up until Layne Staley's passing. Personally I like Man in the Box, Again, No Excuses, & The Rooster.. \\"Again\\" is one of my favorite songs from the band.. whenever I listen to it, the volume goes up to 11. All the videos are there with the obvious exception of their latest releases.. Straight-forward, video compilation is what your getting.. Well worth the money.<br /><br />I've had the dvd for over a year. Cannot remember what I paid, (10 bucks maybe), but well worth it. I know I could just watch them on You Tube but the quality is sooo much better on disc.<br /><br />Sidenote: Enjoyed several songs (and videos) from their last album: \\"Black Gives Way to Blue (2009)\\".. Lesson Learned, Your Decision, Check My Brain to name a few. Hope the band keeps writing and releasing music and videos. They still sound great!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this because it tells you the exact hours and minutes you have to listen to music, surf the web, use wifi, etc. I'm using it for my kindle fire and love it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|not much else.  Even the sex interaction between Ana and Christian becomes repititious and boring (to me).  Consequently, I flipped through most of that after the first book and because of so many friends saying they \\"loved all three\\", and \\"it gets better\\", I purchased the remaining two books (kindle). I should have saved my time and money. More of the same and I grew weary of the adjective \\"salacious\\". Maybe in England that's the only term used to describe erotic whatever. I truly don't understand how these books have had such a huge success. Obviously my opinion is in the minority, but I truly feel these books are not worthy of all the attention. I only gave the two stars for the characters who could have had alot of depth but are instead just vehicles to tickle sexual curiosity.

B0084IG7KC|1.0|This movie is well done, BUT-it presents as a fantasy what is real- the movie describes what we have now!!! with one % or less controlling the wealth. The Occupy movement was not a solution in that it proposed no strategy-<br />Donald Sutherland opines that a future leader will come out of the Occupy Movement?<br /><br />but to me- like other of the movie spokespeople- the director, the \\"stars\\"? the people who made this movie are, unfortunately, liberals- not radicals!<br /><br />The \\"Capital\\" is clearly Washington, DC- with its lobbyists and fat cat politicians. The movie ends on the note that the couple will give the dispossessed Districts \\"hope\\"? No- revolution and struggle would give them hope.<br /><br />The book and movie could have gone further and pointed out how radical movements- like those of civil rights or peace in the 1960's- actually led to read change? But it does not. It has pepole in District 11 raising thier fists in a v signal- but they don't fight back- they don't attack the storm troopers.<br /><br />Juvenile, frivolous- are two words that come to mind- altho I enjoyed watching it as a story- that is not enough.<br /><br />The movie is not that far from the \\"reality tv\\" it supposedly lampoons. It seems to be written by a suburban house wife w limited experience. In life!!<br /><br />Try a couple of documentaries- \\"The Battle of Algiers\\" and \\"Freedom Riders\\". No one has the courage to do a fictional treatment of what needs to be done!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|There are a remarkable number of reviews for the Wool Omnibus (over 1,500 when I wrote this). So I'll keep mine short. These short novels are very engaging, although they are set in a rather dark post apocalyptic world. Like good science fiction, the science fiction setting is just a stage on which the human characters play out. The characters are well drawn and interesting. The technology content is relatively low and this is character based science fiction without much in the way of hard science fiction themes.  After reading the five short novels, I purchased the prequel [[ASIN:1475154771 First Shift - Legacy]] which I'm looking forward to reading.

0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is a well written legal thriller that goes beyond the normal novel in this genre into question of family and the relationship between parents and children.<br /><br />The backbone of suspense in Defending Jacob follows that of the standard legal thriller. There is the crime, the trial and then the end of the trial. Like a three act morality play. However, in Defending Jacob we know early on who committed the crime. The only question is whether the author, William Landay, will pull a plot rabbit out of his hat. But this is not that kind of book. Instead of innocence or guilt being revealed, what we have is the unfolding psychology of Jacob, a teenager accused of murdering a classmate. Much of the suspense comes from the complex portrait of the parents, who must live through the nightmare of the murder trail and their deeper understand of Jacob.<br /><br />The main character in the novel is Jacob's father, Andy, who was an Assistant District Attorney until Jacob was charged with murder. Andy's motivations and the complexity of his character are well drawn. The mechanics of the criminal justice system and Andy's clear eyed view of its failings is also fascinating (we can assume that this is the view of the author, who was an ADA). Andy has a self-absorption that is characteristically male and the portrayal of this is unusual for a male writer (it can be hard to see our own entitlement as men).<br /><br />This is not a classic suspense novel, since it's pretty clear where the novel is going. But what drives the plot and the suspense is the way the adults in the novel react. I read it in two days and it kept me up late the last night.<br /><br />The only parts of the novel that I skipped over where some of the details of the trail. These are probably more fascinating to a criminal attorney than they are to me. The reality of criminal trials is not nearly as fascinating as the portrayal in novels. The ADA tends to drive their point home, again and again, since they have experience with juries coming to surprising and unjustified conclusions. Compared to this, the trial was greatly summarized. But if it had been summarized even more, the plot would not have suffered.ince they have experience with juries coming to surprising and unjustified conclusions.

B008ENNXQI|3.0|Light and airie fare that provided a modicum of laughter. Movie plot better than expected and significantly different to Snowwhite and the huntsman.
034580404X|4.0|There was so much talk about this trilogy that I had to read it.  It was very good and once you start you can't put them down.  I usually read true crime, so this was out of the loop for me.  I thought it was like an erotic Danielle Steele novel.  $ is never an problem and everything always turns out great in the end.  It was a very interesting good read.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy is probably the best money Ive spent on books.  I even offer them to my friends at work to read, at least Ill get my monies worth!!  If you are looking for a great read, get these books, you wont be disappointed!!!
0345803485|1.0|It is so sad that this garbage is topping the bestseller lists. And by garbage I'm not referring to the sex scenes which are about as exciting as watching paint dry. Could not the author be bothered to change things up a little, like maybe have Ana say something besides different versions of \\"crap\\" (oh crap, double crap, holy crap!!) or \\"Jeez\\" or maybe have her flush a little less than an average of once every half a page?  The same thing ad nauseum, \\"oh, he's so sexy but I don't know if I can handle his perversions\\" then some great sex, puctuated by much lip biting, flushing, \\"crap!\\" and then it begins all over again. I'm not in the least curious about what happens in the second and third sequels and all I can conclude by the sales of this book is that there are an awful lot of people out there who don't care what they read.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I was immediately drawn to watch this movie for several reasons.  I'm an ex-Navy Corpsman, have read several books about the Seals and some authored by Seals.<br /><br />This film captures in part the hard work that it takes to achieve their elite team membership, their sacrifices to keep our country free, and their intelligence as well as there craftmanship to do their tasks.  The characters were convincing without stardom and that for me was a real breath of fresh-air.<br /><br />Only a few films bring the intensity to the screen like \\"Act Of Valor.\\"  \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was of course on a grander scale (WWII) and \\"We Were Soldiers\\" (Vietnam War).<br /><br />I congratulate all the participants for this great film and highly recommend this be included in your film library!
B0085A9J18|4.0|Its normally kinda hard to read your way through a movie, but this was very good.

Especially in a teenage-high-school-boy kind of way. I watched it over a week ago and still laugh about it with my co-workers almost every single day. I definitely recommend this one for a \\"laugh until you cry\\" kind of movie.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This film was not good. I love seeing movies. I also really enjoy fun-bad movies and had high hopes for this. Unfortunately this film was just bad. The storyline was weak, the acting wooden (which is odd because the cast has a lot of great actors). The fish out of water scenes have been done far better elsewhere. The McDonald's joke fell completely flat. the movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama. There is such thing as a dramedy but it didn't have the chops to pull it off.  And then the ending became a 'throw everything including the kitchen sink at it' and hope something makes sense. Which it did not. I want my two hours back.
0062082353|4.0|I read a lot of great reviews for this book. I also saw an interview of the guy who wrote it. After seeing his interview I decided it should be a good book. I had also seen a movie called  \\"Act of Valor\\". The stars of the movie were real Navy Seals. It made me really interested in their lives.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades, Freed, totaly awesome. can't wait to read more. So much action too. love the characters development. would love to see this on the screen.
1401937519|5.0|It is so exciting that this profound healing event will be brought to the attention of so many people via author Anita Moorjani's sheer courage. Because, yes, although her transformative experience was compelling, she could have easily resisted taking it further, dismissing it all once she re-engaged a full 'normal' life.<br /><br />Her experience verified my own encounters with the divine, although mine were not by way of trauma. Like Anita Moorjani, I'd like people to understand that 'waking up' to the gift of this life does not have to wait for the lightning strike of an NDE. I will delight in continuing to recommend this book.<br /><br />[...]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Jaw dropping, \\"holy cow!!!\\".Intruiging book, couldn't stop reading. Read all three books twice,thinking about a third time. so many details missed the first time around.<br />everyone enjoy.
0345803485|2.0|50 Shades of Gray? Has anyone ever heard of Beauty's Punishment by A.N. Roquelaure (Ann Rice)? Terrible writing, to the point I'm beginning to think it's a secret national joke.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely the best, Fifty Shades darker was very spell binding. alot of thinking going on. couldn't put the book down.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|This is my first book review so I am not inclined to pull punches. After an incredible wait, what a colossal waste of time and money. This last installment was a huge disappointment...if anything the writing style has deteriorated to a mass confusion of characters and direction. At this point, I could care less who lives, dies or just disappears so I will NOT be waiting for the next book.
B0083F5JE6|3.0|I think there are maybe 2 songs that are ok.  It's not that the music is horrible or anything.  If you judge it on it's own it is a decent album.  If you hold it up against Maroon 5's other albums then this one is just ok.  Not to mention I was a little upset that I had to buy this album twice because the first time my wife bought it at Target so that she could get some bonus tracks that were only available on the Target release.  Well, you can't get that version at Target in the radio(clean) version.  She was so disappointed that some of her favorite songs that she heard on the radio sounded like a drunk sailor was singing it.  She loves to listen to music in the car with our kids and this was one that she couldnt share with them it was so vulgar.  So I ended up buying her this \\"clean\\" version.  However this version doesnt have the bonus tracks.  So whatever.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally,  the REAL Pinterest app. It works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire. The layout is beautiful and the images are crisp and clear. Very easy to navigate. Love it!
B004SBX112|5.0|I finished the original so had to get this one. I love it. There are not as many levels and I'd bet my bottom dollar it is more difficult, but that's probably just me. Still love it, and I'm bound and determined to finish so I can get Rio.<br />Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book. Fell totally in love with the characters!  It was kinky but there is an amazing story under that!  Christian is dark and twisted and SEXY!!!  Couldn't wait to read the other books and will definitely read again!!!

B0066WJLU6|5.0|I never leave reviews for apps but I think this one deserves a review.<br />I searched and searched for a flashlight, they all sucked, weren't bright enough, mostly. This app is simply amazing ; it allows me to not only see in the dark with absolutely no problem - the flashlight can change colors, and regardless of the Color chosen, its still brighter than you can imagine.<br />Thanks for creating such a wonderful, effective, and intuitive tool!! If you are looking for a flashlight all, I strongly recommend this one. It works fantastically on a kindle fire!!
B00425S1H8|1.0|it worked for about 15 minutes and quite working.  I removed and reinstalled messed with it for about 20 minutes then bought on from a different company that works great. This was with windows 7
B004VMVTNU|4.0|This app works nicely with my Kindle Fire.  It has a simple and elegant interface, lots of programmable settings and is very intuitive.  I have tried several other alarm apps with disappointing results.  If you want a nice, simple app without personal assistant software I doubt you'll go wrong with this one.
B008645YEE|2.0|A heavy and funeral like soundtrack that is more ponderous than the prior two and ultimately not worth buying. Only one track (#13) is worthwhile; the rest is slow and pretty useless. The movie would have been better if this soundtrack were better too - Zimmer by himself is not as good and his fallout with the other composer in the two prior films led to this lousy soundtrack. Zimmer is good in other things such as the Sherlock Holmes movies he has scored. The movie script that went this this soundtrack is also to blame perhaps as they made the movie a miserable hero movie with Batman unhappy as both Wayne and Batman and a villian who was absurd and a script that was too detailed on side stories and disappointing as an overall story. If you want to hear the theme music you associate with the trilogy of Batman movies - buy the Dark Knight (second movie) and you will love it. This one is not worth the price, save one track. Also this album does not provide a lot of music from the movie that was left out for reasons known only to the producer(s).
038572179X|2.0|I read this for my book club and was looking forward to it, based on all the buzz about book and movie.<br /><br />It's certainly an interesting literary excercise because the way the plot twists and turns and the different points of view. I enjoy reading novels that are set in the English countryside.<br /><br />But for me, it wsan't a good read. I thought it might be a love story with conflict.  It's wasn't much of a love story, it wasn't a coming of age story and it wasn't a war story. Yet there are elements of each in this book, but it felt disjointed.  I didn't really care about Dunkirk. I was glad when the lovers re-connected -- but that was just a figment of Briony's imagination.<br /><br />I didn't find the ending uplifting, because it didn't happen.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I instantly fell in love with the series, and that what drove me to purchase the dvd. I want to support my favorite actress, Meghan Markle.<br />So on to the product, I loved it.

055380684X|1.0|Haven't read the book and won't until some sanity seeps into the traditional publishing industry. There is no earthly reason why a Kindle book should be more expensive than it's tree killing and oil burning sibling. I refuse to buy any book priced this way and I urge you to refuse also.
0143119680|3.0|I'm a sucker for books about lost manuscripts. I'm obviously also a sucker for books about doomed relationships involving magical creatures that somehow have happy ever afters, so it kinda a given that one day I'd break down and spend the big bucks to buy the book everyone has been talking about for the last six months.<br /><br />Real life historian with a focus on Alchemists through history, Deborah Harkness obviously is writing about what she knows, when she is weaving history, alchemy, and famous English libraries into her book. Where the novel falls short is its familiar treatment of familiar settings and couplings of other famous Paranormal Romance and Y/A books that have gone before it.  A Discovery of Witches is being hailed as Twilight for adults.  I'd like to throw Harry Potter in the mix as well. The upside is the literate aspects of the book, (here-in called ADOW for ease of typing's sake) which discusses Evolution, famous historical characters, and surprisingly pits Alchemy against Darwinism rather than the usual religion vs. evolution war, and for that I thought it was very unique. The downside is, she didn't stretch her creative wings enough but instead chose to ride on those, others had flown with before.<br /><br />This author is a real, honest to god historian. She has so much to play with, I don't know why she had to create a world so familiar, but clearly it is just what the market wanted. In the past she had two books published (probably through her college) that received a total of 5 book reviews. The books were well received critically, by her fellow historians but nobody else bought them. And then she wrote ADOW, a long winded Paranormal Romance and became famous.<br /><br />ADOW has about 1100 book reviews on Amazon. It has been written about in everything from People Magazine to the New York Times, and is going to become a movie. The reviews seem to fall into two camps; those who are madly in love with it, and those who absolutely hate it. I disagree with both. I thought it was at times brilliant and at times a massive disappointment. The disappointment is not for what it is so much as what it could be, and isn't. She is an excellent writer, she could have come up with something more creative then the following scenario, upon which much of the bones of the story hinges upon.<br /><br />1.A witch who was orphaned at a young age, whose parents were murdered by a powerful wizard who was threatened by their power. They sacrificed their lives to protect the protaganist and she has been raised by her Aunt. The parents do something with Magic to protect her before they die. She may turn out to be the most powerful wizard (oops sorry...) I mean Witch, ever.<br /><br />2.A much older male Vampire who meets her at school, is obsessed with a female who (while not a human like in Twilight) is still much more frail then he is and so he must always be on his guard with her. He knows he should stay away from her but he breaks in her house to watch her sleep. He loves the way she smells, and catalogs all the different flowers and herbs she smells like to him. He is at first angry and irritable with her, but he is massively protective and will kill anyone who threatens her. His Vampire friends are upset that he is attracted to this woman. Their love can't be consummated because he is afraid he might hurt her, or he wants to wait or something. I don't know, I got so tired of watching two adults act like teenage kids I can't remember if they ever actually had sex or not.<br /><br />J.K Rowling and Stephanie Meyers should ask for a portion of the receipts.<br /><br />Harkness's world is one of Humans, Witches, Vampires, and lastly the poor Daemon's (who aren't demons, but are basically slightly wacked out hyper creative sorts who are the Mozart's of the world, and often can't function in the real world. Other then visions of the future, the Daemon's kinda get short shrift as far as magical abilities goes).<br /><br />Theprotaganist, Diana Bishop is an American historian who has returned to Oxford, England to continue her studies in famous historical Alchemist's for a dissertation she is going to give. (The above is all applicable to Harkness as well, in fact there are so many similarities between the protagonist and the author, Diana's name could well have been Mary Sue.)<br /><br />Dr. Diana Bishop isn't just an intellectual with a penchant for studying historical Alchemy, she is also a witch from a long line of witches (going back of course to Salem's witches which all fictional witches seem to need to use as a touch stone.) For some inexplicable reason Diana \\"usually\\" refuses to use her magic, allotting herself only the occasional magical sin like fixing the washing machine when it goes on the fritz. While in the library she asks for a book called Ashmole 782, which it turns out has been hiding in the Bodleian Library for over a hundred years. Her magic rears it's head and breaks the spell, sending out a shock wave to the magical community.<br /><br />Suddenly the library is full of \\"Creatures,\\" all staring at her while she is trying to study. Vampires, Witches, and Daemon's follow her around waiting for her to call the book back up. They all want to get their grubby little paws on Ashmole 782, each group for different reasons. When Diana returns it, everyone wants her to call it back up and give it to them. The Witches want the book because it will tell them how to attack and kill Vampires magically. The Vampires want the book to destroy it for the above reason. And the Daemon's want the book because they hope it will explain how they came to be created. The poor Daemon's are the only ones who deserve the damn book in my opinion. The Witches are born so they know how they are created, Vampires are made, but no one knows what makes a Daemon, and so children who are born to human's are often treated like freaks by their terrified parents when the \\"Gifts\\" arrive. This one book is enough to nearly create a war between the species.<br /><br />Diana is approached by  the 1500 year old (and of course gorgeous) Vampire, Matthew Clairmont, who is also (of course) a brilliant academic with doctorate degrees in four different discipline . He is rich, aloof, distant towards women, and suddenly obsessed with average looking and socially awkward  Bella...I mean Diana. Can you tell this is a fantasy written by a middle aged academic?<br /><br />Vampire, Matthew Clairmont has wanted Ashmole 782 for over 100 years as he is trying to scientifically analyze what creates magical creatures. He is a smarter version of Edward who continues to go, not to highschool, but to one of the highest levels of college, and has studied with and learned from the brightest minds in the world. He hears about Diana and goes to the library where he sees her use her magic, and begins to basically stalk her to find out more about the book. These two break every magical rule in the book when they fall in love and team up to try to find the book again. Only instead of trying to find the book again, they basically run and hide.<br /><br />ADOW's settings are gorgeous, Oxford England, a Mansion in France, a magical Farmhouse in the midwest of America.  I also loved all the nods to historical people and places. At times lyrical and thought provoking it was also however maddeningly slow and in desperate need of editing. At over 600 pages ADOW has scene of meal after meal after meal. A surprising number meals given that one of the pair is a VAMPIRE.  Likewise, the main character, Diana is always fussing with her hair.  There are long (to me anyway)boring descriptions of the two of them taking Yoga together. Yoga. For god's sake. The two of them reading hand written copies of everything from Shakespeare to The Origin of Species, all signed to Matthew of course. And long winded descriptions of wine. What makes good wine, what the best wines are in the world today and by the way, Matthewhas them all and is willing to share. We get long descriptions of Diana being initiated into learning all about wine. You get the idea. He's catnip to a fictional historical academic, and the perfect fictional hero to a living one as well.<br /><br />I could not get a handle on Matthew's character. He is in the beginning oddly hostile and surprisingly angry at the slightest thing (again, shades of Edward), then he becomes shy and uncertain around her. He's 1500 years old, I doubt there would be much shyness left after having lived through the dark ages, and the black plague.<br /><br />Once these two lovebirds start exchanging lists of what the other smells like to them (he smells of cinnamon and clove and carnation pinks, she smells like...oh seriously who cares,) the plot almost dissolves. Instead of getting to the bottom of what is in the damn book (Ashmole 782) that has every creature's panties in a bunch for a 200 mile radius, these two go on Inter-species Yoga dates, and have long meals with lectures on wine tasting and long walks. Harkness by the way has a blog on wine tasting that has won awards so she is knowledgeable, perhaps too much so for a fictional escapist novel. Too much detail and something can lose its alure.<br /><br />At first Diana doesn't want anything to do with him. Then they start hanging out all the time because he wants information on the book, then they start to fall in love and he tells her they can never be together. She is crushed. The lovers almost kiss. She gets threatened by bad witches and he takes her to his Mother's castle in France to protect her and then leaves her, saying they can't be together at which point she turns into a watering witch and almost floods the Mansion with her tears and nearly drowns herself. In other words, just a week or two into knowing Edward, oops I mean Matthew, she is ready to die if she can't be with him. Where did my independent, brilliant, educated witch from the beginning of the book go?<br /><br />The forbidden and implied, doomed love affair of a Witch and a Vampire in ADOW is so all consuming to the story,  it loses some of the excitement a book like this needs to move the whole thing forward, and the obsessive focus on the romance takes away from any action or plot involving the magical book. Nothing much happens, and some of what does happen, happens off page. There are only, in over 600 pages, two times where I thought ....now we are talking, something serious is about to happen. Which again reminded me of Twilight.<br /><br />There are some fascinating themes, the idea of Vampires working in DNA labs to try to find out more about their origins and her idea of Daemon's was new to me. I thought it ridiculous however, that in all of history these are the only two who have crossed the bi-magical dating line. ADOW is at times fun and thought provoking. It is also at times as dull as watching the dust settle on the books our heroine loves so well, and that is the real tragedy here. It could be so much more.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I have a kindle fire and it worked just fine for me. After reading the reviews I had braced myself for it to crash or stop working but nothing happened. Re-pinning,  switching categories and viewing profile etc works great on my fire. Very, very happy with this app.
0547258305|4.0|This book took me by total surprise and I ended reading for almost 9 hours straight, despite kids, dinner, finals and everything else. The cover did say it would slake the thirst of (desperate) twilight fans.... Well, yes and no. Let me tell you right now - it's NOT another Twilight. Some Twilight fans will love the story - others will not. There are no vampires, but plenty of drama, romance and suspension for everyone who loves that. :-)  But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me tell you a little of the world Cashore has created;<br /><br />There are 7 Kingdoms ( The Middlums, The Leinid, The Sunder, The Estill, The Wester, The Nander and the Monsea).<br /><br />Once in a while a child is born with a Grace. Being Graced means you're exceptionally good at something. Their gift could be as simple as the ability to do something small and do it exceptionally well like whistle or swim, but it could also be to excel in a lethal ability to fight or always hitting your target with a bow.<br /><br />These children, the Graced ones are known by their eyes - they have two different colors. Usually when it becomes clear that the child is Graced, the king sends for the child.<br /><br />The Grace can be years in developing, so nobody truly knows what kind of Grace the child has. If the Grace is valuable to the king - then he keeps the child in his service. If not - the child goes home. People usually mock the Graced ones (depending on the kingdom), and keep their distance.<br /><br />In Graceling we meet a regiment of wonderful characters, each one more wonderful, hilarious and infuriating then the one before! I will get back to a few of them, but first I want to introduce the main characters: Katsa and Po. Both with a Grace.<br /><br />Katsa is the niece of King Randa of the Middlums. Katsa's Grace is killing. Something she's not exactly proud of, but makes the best of it. Her uncle has used her for years and Katsa is tired of being feared. Everytime someone crosses King Randa, he sends his niece and her reputation alone is frightening. Katsa is the kind of person you scare your kids with if they don't behave. But she is so much more underneath her though-ass image. Katsa has created a Council that her uncle doesn't know anything about. This council works under the radar, helping where they can.<br /><br />Po is also Graced, but his Grace is fighting - or so he claims. Po is actually short for Prince Greening Grandemalion, and he is the grandson of a Leinid that Katsa has rescued earlier. This is how they meet - Po arrives at King Randas court. He's officially looking for his grandfather, even though he knows that Katsa had something to do with his rescue from a dungeon - they \\"accidently\\" run into each other. It's a great, great scene, where a huge piece of Katsa's personality is shown.<br /><br />Po and Katsa becomes friends, something Katsa's isn't used to. She doesn't have many friends, because of her Grace. People fear her.<br /><br />Even though Po's grandfather been saved, there's still a puzzle to solve, because, who ordered him kidnapped in the beginning?<br /><br />There are SO many great sidecharacters in this book - from Katsa's cousin (Randa's son), Raffin, who loves his experiments (medicin), Giddeon, who \\"secretly\\" loves Katsa, princess Bitterblue, a strong, strong little girl (Po's little cousin), captain Faun, who helps our travelers out when they're in need, all of Po's family and many, many more!<br /><br />The story about Katsa, who's been greatly misused by her uncle and how she rises from her chains is amazing. How she turns mistrust to trust and defeat to hope and does the most impossible thing - bringing Po's little cousin to safety.... It was AMAZING! I was sitting with my eyes glued to the computer, turning page upon page and being more and more stunned as the story played in front of me. I was practically biting my nails when the big showdown between Katsa and her uncle came, fervently cheering on Katsa, cheering for her release from her uncle. And almost crying when the story ended.<br /><br />Cashore has created a world that truly is amazing and I can barely wait to go into it again and read more!!created a world that truly is amazing and I can barely wait to go into it again and read more!!
B0064RAW56|5.0|The best of Zafon's.  The most mature of this Angel trilogy. Very engaging and fascinating. You dont expect the final to the very end. I strongly recommend it.
0345522478|4.0|The first novel in an original, back-to-back three-book series The Iron Druid Chronicles--introducing a cool, new, funny urban fantasy hero<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old--when in actuality, he's twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he's hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power--plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish--to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.<br /><br />Sometimes it is really nice to read a fantasy written from a male perspective. There are some wonderful series out there where the MC is male; Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, Simon Green's Nightside series, Rob Thurman's Cal Leandros books (and yes, I know Rob is a woman).<br /><br />Sometimes, a series is like a relationship. It was so much fun in the beginning, there was a joy to the wild crazy world building and interactions as the players all got to know each other or as we began to know the players. However, all relationships over time change, and the books, and the characters need to change  as well. Obviously, if a character doesn't grow and change over a series of books, if they are NOT affected by the often horrific things they are subjected to by their creator, they  would become stagnant.<br /><br />However, by the same token, sometimes the books become so dark, grim, and morose we lose a much of the  joy we had when we first started reading the series. It doesn't mean we don't enjoy the author anymore,  or the character...we do. We're loyal fans,  just....we miss things the way they used to be, when every thing was fun and new and when our protagonist was so damn tortured. I love Dresden, but he's had such a wretched time he's a ghost now for God's sake.<br /><br />I picked up HOUNDED, within minutes settled in and went...\\"Yeah...now we are talking.\\" It was as if Hearne took the things we loved about so many of our favorite series, and then lightened everything back up. Who knows, maybe after 22 books (we should be so lucky), we'll all be worn out along with Atticus but as of now, he is a laid back hottie, who has a goddess or two in his pocket and after his bod, a stolen magical sword strapped to his back, and a telepathic dog who has a thing for French Poodles. It was smartly written, fun, and a delight, and it was kinda like falling in love again, with a brand new character. Count me in, I'm a new fan.<br /><br />A long time ago, hundreds of years ago, our hero Atticus, the last living druid on the planet, had the opportunity to steal a celtic god's magical sword. Aenghus &Oacute;g, has tried for centuries to get it back by having others attempt to do his dirty work, none of whom was able to pull off the stunt. Aenghus is still pissed about it and has decided to finally go after his sword in person.  Evidently Aenghus is a God of Love, but he is such a jerk, you are glad the magical sword is with the good guy, Atticus. This God has been hounding Atticus for hundreds of years and it looks like this time, he isn't going to stop until one of them is dead. Aenghus &Oacute;g isn't afraid to use the local police, Witches, and has even gone so far as to call in favors from other dieties to try to take Atticus down.<br /><br />Atticus may look too young to own his own Occult bookstore, (he looks like a 21 year old slacker), but he is over 21 hundred years old, and he didn't livethat long by  doing anything stupid, like picking fights with gods, but sometimes when the fight is brought to you, you gotta make a stand and utilize what resources you have, because the sword shouldn't be in the hands of a deity who is a bully. Atticus has a telepathic dog named Oberon who is his best friend, a team of lawyers who are kinda friends of his, one is a Werewolf and one is a Vampire...but that doesn't stop them from charging him $300.00 a billable hour. However, watching them in action...they're worth every penny. If I ever got in any kind of trouble, I'd want lawyers like these guys!<br /><br />Atticus is also friends with a little old Irish lady who likes to have a wee dram with him on the porch after he finishes burying the odd body or two in her back yard, which she is perfectly fine with as long as they are English. He has a deal with The Morrigan, a Goddess of Death who shows up either as a crow or a gorgeous naked lady, and a Coven of Polish Witches that may or may not be on his side. Also, there is a hot bartender who is more then she seems, then there is Brigid, and Flidais, and....seriously...just read the book. There are so many mythological characters coming and going out of his little store it is impossible to keep track. You don't feel lost when you're reading the books, you just kind of stand their with a silly grin on your face as something else awesome comes into play.<br /><br />I loved how Hearne weaves history and myth through the book, with Atticus having to make deals left and right if he wants to come out of this alive. It was great to read a new, strong, Urban Fantasy debut featuring a male protaganist who was smart and funny instead of just snarky and a smart ass. Atticus isn't out to save the world so much as he is out to save his ass, and if he has to do the right thing along the way, he will. It was really fun to have the magic AND the fun together again.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The description of this book really attracted me to read it, but I was a bit apprehensive because some<br />of the books that create a big hype don't always live up to my expectation.<br />But luckily City of Bones wasn't one of those hyped books that ended up being boring and badly written.<br />I love it! I loved Cassandra Clare's writting style, loved the story, adored the charachters!<br /><br />I can't wait to read more books of this series!
0425241505|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I read it during lunch. I picked right back up as soon as I got off work and since it was an E-book on my laptop, I actually dragged my laptop around the house because I couldn't stop reading. I literally had my laptop set up on the kitchen counter while I cooked. Once done, the very next day, I went back and read it again. Then... a day or two later, withdrawals came on and I went in and read all my favorite parts all over again.<br /><br />Thea Harrison has written 16 other novels under the name Amanda Carpenter, and the experience shows. The book begins with a bang. The heroine, half Wyr (shape shifter) Pia Giovanni is on the run. Her shithead ex-boyfriend sold information about her to some very bad men. Information she has tried to hide and keep secret her entire life. She has quite a few secrets (one of which the book deliciously makes us wait to find out until almost the very end).<br /><br />Blackmailed and forced to steal something from one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in America, Dragos Cuelebre, Pia is terrified. Dragos is the last shape shifter Dragon, and to steal something from his Hoard is the ultimate insult and punishable by death. The bad guys didn't tell her what she had to steal, so she only takes a penny (she even leaves one in its place), but the roar Dragos lets out once he finds it missing is so loud, glass breaks and buildings crack all across Manhattan.<br /><br />It is clear that he isn't going to see the humor in her theft, so Pia takes off to the Southern Demesnes of the Elves in an attempt to hide, and the chase is on. Dragos in his search for information about his thief comes across a video of her and once he does, everything changes. Oh he still wants to catch her, he just isn't so sure about what he's going to do once he does.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two was incendiary, the fights were spectacular, the affection and growing love was incredibly touching. Dragos and Pia have a lot of obstacles in their way. Dragos has pissed off the Elves by arriving in their lands to steal his thief, and the Dark Fae King Urien wants to kill both of them.<br /><br />Dragos is the equivalent of Wyr royalty, running one of the six Demesnes, a feudal system of dividing the lands. He has been giving orders and expecting them to be carried out for hundreds of years. He lives, works and owns a massive high-rise that is a modern day castle of industry with teams of security and lawyers and publicists, all of whom are stunned by his obsession and what some see an unnecessary distraction with Pia.<br /><br />Pia is a terrific character. She isn't powerful at all, is very vulnerable in this world she is inhabiting, however she is brave, loyal, and funny and doesn't do so good with the carrying out orders thing. She has to wade through some interesting Family/Royal politics to find her place in his world. She isn't sure she even wants to do it. A woman who was raised by her now dead mother, to hide who and what she is at all costs, keep her head low and be a loner, is now mated to the most powerful Wyr there is, and he does NOT like secrets. I have never read a Paranormal Romance that featured Pia's Shape shifter type and that surprise was great fun.<br /><br />There are a many common Paranormal Romance tropes going on in this story. The uber alpha, the group of warriors who all work for him, the chase of one lover for another (my only complaint is I half wished the chase lasted longer, it was so exciting!) On the surface, DRAGON BOUND doesn't sound that new or original but to me it stood out as one of the best I've ever read.<br /><br />It is going to be interesting to see how Harrison handles the next book in the series, STORMS HEART, which comes out August 2nd, featuring two of the characters we saw in DRAGON BOUND.<br /><br />Tricks the new Queen of the Dark Fae and former Publicist for Cuelebre Enterprises, and Tiego, one of Dragos inner circle and a ThunderBird are not twopeople who get along. At all. So I'm expecting some fireworks, or rather...thunder and lightning.<br /><br />I'm always a little concerned when the first book of the series starts with the Top Dog in the pecking order, or in this case top dragon. If you start at the top, where can it go from there? However I was delighted to find out who the next couple was because some of the best scenes involving side characters in DRAGON BOUND involved them.<br /><br />I hope Harrison can keep up the excitement and passion and originality that was in DRAGON BOUND, because if so, and I do not say this lightly, I feel this series could be on par with Kresley Coles Immortal's After Dark, and how exciting is that?...thunder and lightning.

B002UWH8SS|1.0|If you were a fan of Stargate, of Sci-fi, of techno babble that left you feeling intelligent at the end of an episode...you will absolutely hate SGU.  More attuned to \\"reality tv\\" with a heavy focus on interpersonal drama vs science, technology, or exploration, SGU was and is an embaressment and an insult to those who loved the previous franchises. Sure, SG1 and Atlantis had their lows, but to attach the Stargate name to a series that is so little about gate travel and exploration and so much about who is having sex with who...perhaps \\"Wormhole Xtreme\\" would have been a more fitting title.<br /><br />Either way, its easy to see why the show was canned.  Even if it was getting better, the way it was portrait in the first season alone was enough to turn off long time fans of both SG1 and Atlantis. Its hard enough to create a new show, its even harder to turn your back on your entire fanbase by attaching a franchise name to a poor show and expecting it to succeed.<br /><br />In the end, all we wanted was more Stargate, all we got was some trashy romance novel.

B0033H7VI6|4.0|It was my birthday and I had a gift certificate burning through my pocket, so I decided to check out some fixed blade knives for camping/ hiking/ general outdoors usage.  I've been really happy with my orange folding Endura for all of the finer cutting and slicing, but wanted something beefier for basic woodcraft and firebuilding.  I am by no means a wilderness or survival expert, but I grew up camping, hiking, and occasionally short backpacking trips.  Now my wife and I mostly camp in the local national forest system and enjoy less-than-rustic, mostly clear sites, so I am not constrained to weight (and this guy is a solid fellow).  I already have a Ka Bar I like, so I turned to the Becker line first.  I was on a pretty solid $70 budget max, so I could have covered the BK2 or the BK7 with a few extra bills and, originally, this was my plan.  I was bothered by the rather simplistic looking plastic grips, upgrading to Micarta was an extra expense I couldn't afford.  Then came the blade thickness.  I really had wanted a 0.25 inch thick blade, which the BK2 bears proudly, but unfortunately is shaped short and fat like a trowel to me.  People's only complaint about that knife seemed to be the heft to it, even moreso than the BK7.  The BK7 had the 7 inch blade size I liked better, but the thinner blade and was at the max of my price range.<br />Enter the SCHF9<br />It had the 1095 steel, the 0.25 blade width, and just shy of 7 inches (with 6 \\" of actual cutting surface).  I had a small Schrade folder from when I was a kid, but I haven't seen any since, so I thought I would test it out and if I hated it I could just exchange it towards one of the Beckers.  The knife arrived beautifully, protected well in it's box, even though some textbooks in my order crushed it.  The blade steel was clean and spotless, almost a bead blasted- gunmetal gray tone.  Heavy, as expected, with a beautiful curve to the blade that resembles the kopis style on my CS Spartan.  The blade was sharp enough to shave a small patch of hair on my arm, but still got even sharper with a few pulls through a carbide sharpener I have.  The Kraton handles don't line up perfectly with the tang, but are definitely close enough for a knife in this price range.  It does not effect the grip or functionality of the knife.  They have a comfortable swell to them and are \\"checkered\\" with a circle/ half circle pattern which gives it a nice, slightly rubbery grip.  I fastened a 550 cord wrist strap to the knife, and I can comfortably move from choking up on the blade with the extra notch in front of the handle and my thumb on the spine of the blade for more control, to a basic forward grip with my thumb on the jimping, to just my first two or three fingers on the end of the handle with the support of the strap for chopping.<br />Much has been said about the relative cheapness of the sheath.  Is it as good as a custom molded sheath?  Most probably not.  But is it functional as it stands?  I think so.  I haven't gone and hiked the Appalachians with it on my hip or anything, but the ballistic nylon- type material looks as if it would hold up for most average activity transporting the knife on the hip.  You can velcro the sheath onto your belt, which is nice if you hate taking your belt on and off for holsters and such.  There is a shoelace strength cord on the bottom for securing around your thigh, which I automatically replaced with more 550.  It sits nice on the hip, a little lower than the top of the belt so you can move around without it poking you in the side (if you have some extra in the middle like me, or wearing a puffy jacket, this would be a very nice feature).  One thing I was concerned about from the pictures was the retention strap and the plastic insert to protect the blade.  It looked to be velcro, but the strap does have a metal snap on it, which I liked.  Schrade must have read the complaints about the blade bouncing in the plastic protector as well, because the firsttime I attempted to seat the blade into it, the blade physically separated a small portion of plastic holding the sides together.  I had to shake some plastic slivers out after, but from then on, it felt fairly snug.  Still not tight enough to hold it in place if you turn it upside down, run, or jump with it, but just enough that I don't notice much rattling.  There is a little place on both sides of the blade surface that looks like the plastic rubs gently with the blade, but I take that as a tradeoff for not having it shaking around in there.  Nothing a little oil didn't fix right up.  There is a small pouch on the front of the knife for a whetstone or fire steel (or both, actually), but not really big enough for, say, a pistol mag if you had that in mind for any reason (unless its a 380 sized mag).  It could probably fit a multitool of some sort as well.<br />All and all, I am very happy with this purchase.  I looks promising enough that I am going to keep it and take it on the next camping trip to test it outdoors.  If you actually read all of this review, thank you.  It took me a lot of time looking around on Amazon to find something that fit my needs, and I was hoping I could help answer some questions that I originally had about it before I bought it.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I never saw the original film of the same name, so I can't compare the two and I wouldn't try anyway. I was hesitant about seeing this, but other viewers reviews were so positive that I was curious. I was pleased that this film lived up to the reviews. It is a very good mystery. It begins slow, but the pace speeds up until the end. It can be a bit confusing going back and forth from one scene to another in locale, but it comes together nicely.<br />If you have an interest in good mysteries, you shouldn't be disappointed by this one.

1579128955|5.0|\\"The Elements- A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe\\", is a book which holds almost every possible detail of the Periodic Table of Elements. This book includes extensive pictures of each element in many different shapes and sizes. The passages on each element give examples on where you could find this substance; for example, the book says that some shorts are made of silver thread, which would protect you against electromagnetic fields. Giving examples of the elements is great because it opens up the readers mind to science and the many different possibilities it holds.<br /><br />Any person who loves Chemistry would love this book. Chemistry is based on The Periodic Table of Elements, so chemistry readers would definitely love its extensive content on each element.<br /><br />The most interesting parts are the examples it gives. For instance, by reading this book I learned that Cadmium is best known for its use in nickel-cadmium batteries. Facts like these would absolutely entice chemistry lovers into buying this book. This book would be really great for 13+ people. Anyone who loves chemistry should absolutely read this book.<br /><br />It is informative, interesting, and fun to read! I personally love chemistry, and reading this book has shown me that chemistry takes place outside the lab in your everyday life.<br /><br />Review by Young Mensan Saloni T., age 16, Northern New Jersey Mensa

0345803485|1.0|Oh my. This book (I can't bring myself to call it a 'novel') is basically Mills and Boon on steroids. Very badly written: no plot, no character development, gushing, cliched, tacky, repetitive and really really irritating. The book length could probably have been reduced by a third if only Ana would stop biting her lip all the time, saying 'oh my' and 'holy crap' and if only Christian's grey eyes would stop blazing and he wasn't always so freaking hot. I noticed another reviewer wondered if this drivel had been written by a teenager because it seemed to be a 16 year old's fantasy; it's too manipulative and blatantly mercenary for that, though I certainly wondered if it had been written for the teenage market (but no, apparently it's middle-aged women - in droves - who go in for this stuff). It's billed as an 'erotic romance', and it may be erotic for some readers but it's definitely NOT a romance. There's absolutely nothing wrong with eroticism, especially when paired with good writing, but this book is just grubby. Yuk, yuk, yuk. Fifty shades of yuk.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of the three in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 89-97 series.<br /><br />Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good \\"Catwoman\\" (I say \\"surprisingly\\" only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.<br /><br />My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when the story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although The Dark Knight Rises is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great, which explains the 4 stars rather than five.<br /><br />But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. The The Dark Knight Rises is a quality Batman film.

6305041156|5.0|Kurosawa's most well-known film is \\"The Seven Samurai\\" from the early 50s.  Of course it's a classic, yet my favorite has gotten to be \\"Ran\\".  It is one of his retelling of a Shakespeare work, this being \\"King Lear\\".  Instead of the kingdom being divided among three daughters as in \\"King Lear\\", the samurai lord divides his among his three sons.<br /><br />  Kurosawa gave the most dramatic touch for one of the battle scenes in their castle.  Here it was shown without any sound of the visual action, only somber music in the background.  Strange for a modern film, where it's usual to increase the volume during such a scene.  But here, the attack on the castle showed all the fire flashes from the muzzles of the black powder rifles, the volleys of arrows, the castle being engulfed in fire, with all the pandemonium.  But all was silent-- only the somber music.  The silence was finally broken with the sound of a loud gunshot, when one of the sons was killed.  Truly a powerful scene.<br /><br />  Toward the end, when the samurai lord gets reunited with his son, is something that has to be seen for its pathos.  Some parts may have too much of a melodramatic touch, perhaps even over-acting.  But that's OK.  And the reprisal against the scheming wife of one of his other sons almost brings on applause.  A just retribution.<br /><br />  Hopefully these thoughts will prepare for some of the scenes.  It's a lot more than so many current films, which just show a lot of killing.  --  George Skoblin

B000FVQLRA|5.0|\\"The Pianist\\" is from a true story, directed by Roman Polanski.  I had first seen it in a theater when released, and now on DVD.  Yet still true even now during all these times, it's not an easy film to watch.<br />  Of special note late in the film is the Nazi officer who discovers the Adrien Brody character W. Szpilman hiding, and then learns he is a composer and pianist.  Only because of this he protects him from discovery by other Nazis.  Quite apparent the officer knows classical music, or is a musician.<br />  Finally after the Nazi defeat, we see the tragic results when Szpilman tries vainly to locate the officer to acknowledge his help. -- George Skoblin

1400052181|4.0|I've been wanting to read this book for a while, but came into it expected a Mary Roach-like pop science book. Which it is-- about every other chapter. (Though with less humor...) Skloot tells the story and history of the HeLa cells. And she recognizes that telling this story involves more than just a clinical recitation of the cells themselves and what occurs in the labs (though much of this is surprisingly dramatic). Skloot also tells the story of Henrietta Lacks-- her life, her death, and her legacy-- not just her lab legacy but the (often tragic) story of her family. Skloot walks a really difficult line here. I'm not convinced she always stays on the right side of it, but she does succeed in giving Henrietta Lacks' children a platform to share their own voices and experiences. This really feels like three books-- one on how racial inequality and race relations plays out on the micro-level (the Lacks' family has a \\"white side\\" and a \\"black side\\"-- this doesn't get a lot of attention in the book but still very interesting), one on the more institutional discrimination intrinsic in our society (medical care being the obvious topic here, not just Henrietta's but also her children and grandchildren, but also discussions of race and prison), and one on the science and politics of the cells themselves (I learned so much about intellectual property as it relates to our own bodies-- enough to make me concerned). Skloot does a decent job at weaving these together, but it still feels a bit rough, thus the 4 stars.<br /><br />Worthwhile read.

Not only did they pay for the cord, but they also upgraded me to 2 day shipping and covered the shipping fee. I am very impressed with their response.

Was it nature or nurture?<br />Be aware before you get this book that, in no way, is it for the faint-hearted, and certainly not to be put on anyone's Christmas list, but definitely one that is thought-provoking and for mature audiences.<br />You have been warned...

B007KUFDBY|5.0|I have always been a fan of Disney movies however treasure planet will always be one my favorite the depths of the main  characters is amazing even if its animation they would easily put most of todays movie actors to shame  I would highly recommend this movie, you won't be disappointed treasure planet delivers!!!!!!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|If you are looking for something to show off your home theater, this is the one. Best audio I've heard by far. I like the sound that comes out of my back speakers as much as I like the fronts, and this has sound whipping all around the room. It looks great too.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game has kept my mind busy during many a long Tv show.  i am on level 53 and still enjoying the game a lot!
B001BANK32|5.0|This book is gripping and kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end i really felt as if i was there in the overlook. Stephen King Truly made a masterpiece! So much better than the movie. This is a must buy for all!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I almost deleted the book from my Kindle after reading the first chapter. I am so glad I didn't.  What started off as a terribly-written, childish story turned rapidly into multiple stories that performed a complex riff around a Narrative that spanned multiple universes and subplots.<br /><br />Scalzi not only writes with wit, but is also a master story-teller.  If you've ever seen Star Trek, you'll enjoy this.  Moreover, if you've grown accustomed to Scalzi's ability to weave action, humor, science fiction, and thoughtful plot development into a satisfying book you'll appreciate Redshirts.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this book more highly.
0345803485|5.0|Loved the book! It has you wondering what's wrong with Christian Grey deep down inside. Ana was a nice charatcer and I'm glad she learned from Grey.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this trilogy!!! I definitely have enjoyed this series and book 2 has kept me going to read book 3.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Year in, year out, the great comedy COMMUNITY get's snubbed at the awards. But that's OK, because this off-the-wall, pop culture referencing show will inevitably be run off the air, and when it does it will find a new home elsewhere. Like Arrested Development is being brought back on Netflix, so too will Community find its way back into our lives, though it may be five to ten years from now.<br /><br />That all being said, it's important to check this program out, if you haven't already. I promise there is something in there for everyone, and it's unlike most of the trash on TV today. SIXSEASONSANDAMOVIE
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I haven't seen a sci-fi movie that I really loved since \\"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\\". Of course I love \\"Alien\\", Aliens\\", \\"Terminator 2\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", but \\"Prometheus\\" in my opinion joins these classics. I saw this film in IMAX 3D with my Film Club friends from my school and it was just jaw-dropping. The Directing by Ridley Scott is just amazing! He returns to sci-fi like \\"Blade Runner\\" was yesterday. He has an eye to amaze audiences with breathtaking visuals. The acting is Oscar worthy. Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Idris Elba give their best performances in this film. (Though most of you will dressage with this, but...) The script is great too. It has a great sense of mystery and wonder. It's not flawless, but it's still one of the more smarter scripts I've seen this  year. The 3D is 100x better then \\"Avatar\\". The depth is just so good, at times I thought I was in the movie (And that's a rare comment for me to say). I give the movie (Even with it's flaws) a 10/10!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show was good from the get-go. The cast is tremendous, and there are so many favorites to choose from, that you really feel at home as the episodes go on. You KNOW someone like each of these characters, and come to love them even more because of it. Modern Family is seriously fun comedy, and I haven't grown tired of it, which is saying something for TV today! Check it out if you haven't already.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|(I know that I'm going to get a lot of negative feedback) I don't get why so many people say that \\"This is a classic!\\" or \\"Original\\". This movie (and the book) is just boring. The themes have been done before, and done WAY BETTER. The characters felt lifeless and dull. The \\"Shaky cam\\" is just AWFUL! I nearly threw up in the theater, it was that bad! Also, the fanbase for this series reminds me way too much of \\"Twilight\\". This movie was one of the worst movie going experiences I've ever had. The fangirls were screaming at pointless stuff. They cried when boring, uninteresting characters died. The applauded at the worst times in the movie and again when the credits rolled. I got out as the credits started rolling. I can't stand it when people ask me what I thought of the movie and whine like a baby when I tell them why I didn't like it. Of course you don't have to agree with me. I respect your opinion (I know that this review doesn't look like it, but it's true). But please don't comment me about how wrong I am and why it's such a modern classic.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|At first, mainly in the pilot, New Girl struck me as uninteresting and not funny. But I wanted to like the show, so I forced myself to watch three episodes. So glad I did! After some warming up, this show really gets going and by the end of the season, most of the jokes are hitting the right marks and you come to LOVE the characters. The cast is great, and without it I think this might not work, but it does. Can't wait for Season 2!

B008XG1X18|5.0|There are other apps out there that are not the correct app for Pinterest Web, so this is the correct one.  I have a Kindle Fire, I down loaded this app. with no problems at all.  So excited useing this on my Fire. Now I can use my Fire instead of going to my lap top for Pinterest. Use to I would use my facebook page on Fire to get into Pinterest but was not satisfied on how to get around Pinterest.

B001AQIYJC|5.0|When it comes to Nicolas Cage, I'm never disappointed. But, City of Angels? Nicolas Cage AND Meg Ryan? What a great movie! It tells a story of hope, dreams and that love conquers all......but not without a price. Nicolas Cage's character shows, that in the face of adversity, no price is too high when it comes to love.<br />  This is a \\"must see\\" movie. Great characters, great story line, great actors!

0307588335|5.0|There are multiple reasons and systemic causes for a total collapse like what happened at Lehman Brothers and the author addresses them all openly, honestly and educationally.  Fabulously written history of how Lehman collapsed. And his inside story of how he got fired from Lehman when they knew exactly that the company was going down and they try to evade their positions to avoid a total collapse.<br />Please buy this book, keep it near you for your entire career, read it regularly and remember why it is important to be honorable to all relationships and finish where you want.<br />Absolutely loved the book! I recommend it to anyone that loves to know about the recent financial meltdown and the world of Wall Street!
B008D28HYS|5.0|Absolutely addicting and can't put it down. was having trouble with it force closing for a while, but realized it was because I was using a task manager to close the program instead of backing all the way out.

B000S0GYRU|4.0|The 1975 SUSPIRIA was so unlike most other horror films from its era that its acquired a near legendary reputation, and though its famous extremely violent murder scenes now seem almost comically faked, the film itself has retained its aura of being something very special even more than thirty years later. Part of what helped it is its extreme strangeness: the film takes place in a mysterious dance academy outside Freiburg, Germany where the teachers guard a dangerous secret and where several of the students keep dying in horrible circumstances. Dario Argento, who had made quite a name for himself by this time in Italy for his visually imaginative (but weakly plotted and characterized) giallo films, was helped enormously by a number of his collaborators for this film: his co-screenwriter Daria Nicolodi, who helped him craft a genuinely unusual storyline involving ancient witchcraft; his cinematographer Luciano Tovoli and production designer Giuseppi Basan, who crafted gorgeous dreamlike settings and lights (both mostly in saturated colors) in which to display the mayhem; the music group Goblin, who crafted the famously disturbing score with Argento; and Jessica Harper, his star who makes something genuine out of her completely underwritten part.<br /><br />Some of the sequences (such as one near the beginning involving Harper watching a young frightened woman run through the woods in a driving thunderstorm parallel to Harper's taxicab) are nearly unforgettable. As always with Argento's films, the whole storyline doesn't make much sense in the end (why are the witches even running a dance academy in the first place?), but this is one of the few times when his sophisticated visuals make you not even care.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fifty Shades, etc. is written like a cheap sex book. There is nothing noteworthy in this trilogy; not the writing, not the characters, and certainly not the plot.  What concerns me most is how the women, Ana and his female employees, are portrayed as very naive, submissive dolts who drool and \\"blush\\" when they look upon this domineering jerk. YUK! I want my money back!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very very very very very fun! reminds me of the movie! the movie was magnificent! ice age is a great movie q

B00526ZKYS|5.0|I chose this book after \\"surfing\\" through available titles for Kindle.  I was not familiar with the author, but now, after reading Delirium, I'm hooked.  The book is a well-written page-turner with a plot that is both far-fetched and tenable.  Clearly, it could happen.  I've been recommending the book to my friends . . . and now to those who read this review.  It's great.
B002ELM5HY|2.0|I became a huge fan two or three years ago and bought every Knopfler CD I could get. I bought this one a year ago and after trying hard to like it, I relegated it to the scrap heap.<br />A Crooner Mark aint!! This album croons me to tears.<br />Apparently the five star guys and gals would give Mark K great marks for gargling while strumming. Im not one of them.<br />I hope his next album has the usual 50% monster lyrics, voice and guitar or Im going to have to find a new hero.<br />PS Take a flyer and buy \\"Best of Rounder Records George Thorogood and the Destroyers\\" for five bucks at Walmart. Its killer!
0307592731|1.0|My wife said I would like this book because I love backpacking. Unfortunatly, the author seems to have zero redeaming qualities. Its hard to feel anything but contempt for her. She cheats on her \\"very loving and supportive\\" husband with little regret, wildly promiscious, she becomes a junkie, gets pregnent and says something to the effect of getting an abortion is a no brainer.  All with no regret rather she seems to revel in it all.<br /><br />Bottom line this is more a story of psuedo-redemption about a woman that goes for a long walk and finishes it but you don't find yourself rooting for her. I think my wife said it best, \\"she seems to be a pretty icky person.\\"
B00782O7NE|1.0|Beware: although advertised as 'all regions', this disc is, in, fact, locked & will only play on Region A players.<br /><br />It even states \\"Regions A, B, C\\" on the packaging, but it will not play on my Region B player, generating a \\"region error\\" message.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|First track plays well, then gets progressively wobbly and slurred until all audio is completely useless. At first I thought there may have been a power problem as the unit is powered through the USB port and does not come with a DC adapter. I then purchased a DC adapter separately and still had the same problem. I cannot believe this item is sold in good conscience. A complete and utter rip-off!!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Very interesting novel of a girl in the foster care system who manages to over come her anger with the help of a foster Mom and her love of flowers and what they symbolize!
0345803485|1.0|I heard a lot of hoopla about this book and picked up a copy.  I normally read a book in a matter of days but it took me a few weeks to finish this one.  Why?  Because I kept falling asleep.  I guess those who have not been exposed to much get a kick from the shock factor.  I considered tossing the book a few times if Ana said \\"Oh my!\\" or \\"Holy sh#t,\\" \\"Holy cow,\\" \\"Holy F--\\" or any other variation of \\"Holy-whatever\\" one more time.  I was just waiting for her to exclaim, \\"Golly gee and shucky darn!\\"  By that time, I was hoping Christian would kill her and it would become a murder mystery.  Christian continuously cocking his head to the side gave me a visual of one of my German Shepherds and I found myself laughing every time I read that overused phrase.  I found the typical pattern of screwed up, abused man dragging his baggage into a relationship that someone else had to understand and suffer from a creepy theme, that of \\"I hurt you then I comfort you,\\" then Ana playing into it, similar to a good case study for dysfunctional/codependency therapists.  Made my skin crawl.  Much better erotica out there, if one is into erotica, which is about the only interesting part of the book, if you can get past picturing Christian as a head-cocking dog and Ana as needy to the point of disliking her.  My lasting impression was that it read like a fantasy roleplay chat log from Second Life, and that made me laugh at the \\"roleplay limits\\" as well.  I won't be reading the second or third books.
0307279189|5.0|I really love this book. I have never been a runner (but rather a walker) and this book inspired me to start running, something I never thought I would enjoy but now do. McDougall is a master storyteller, both educating about running in general and the Tamahumara Indians, and also in relating the fascinating characters in the book. I am grateful, too, for the reminder that, despite what doctors might tell us, our bodies have evolved pretty perfectly.
0307949486|5.0|I got a little lost in the first chapter but after that I couldn't put it down! Amazing writing and character development. It's a must read and a fantastic book. I can't wait to read the rest.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|While many people might be discouraged by the low price I can assure you that it is the best bargain you will find. The writing caliber is a rival to the works of Sanderson and Weeks. Ryan sets a very entertaining and innovative story along with interesting mechanics and  characters which feel true to life. This author and this series are definitely worth following.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|So basically I LOVE this kind of game and can get addicted to it very easily.  The fact that you have to wait on timers means I check it incessantly to see if I can complete more actions.  Now, all along you encounter various disasters every 10 or 20 actions.  Annoying, but doable.  You get 3 options, one which requires actual money, one which requires an initially reasonable amount of game money, and a third which lets the disaster be as bad as it can be.  I always choose option 2 because it's reasonable.  However, it increases every time, and after a while if you build up your town a ton (I got up to 40-70 buildings and over 100 crops), you eventually start encountering disasters every time you try to do much of anything, and they cost me over 20,000 coin a piece for option 2.  All I wanted to do was finish expanding, but I continuously run out of money and then lose half my crops and profits when I am forced to choose option 3.  Instead of a fixed number that you can overcome, it's like a percentage of your town so you can never get ahead no matter what.  I hate the game now and I'm uninstalling it right now.
B007HJ91HU|3.0|I watched this with my daughter. I really enjoyed the differences - the remake of \\"I need a Hero\\" and some of the other music was better than I expected. My stars could be biased by the fact that I still loved the original.

1476712042|1.0|I purchased this book after reading a rave review by a blogger and reading the sample on my Kindle. I wasn't expecting a work of literary genius, it was romance after all. *Spoiler Alert* While I probably wouldn't have slept on that nasty couch either, yuck, I would have taken the cold shower over sleeping in some strange guys bed any day. I could even forgive that because the author had to find some way to bring the two together and maybe I am really out of touch and this is what college kids do these days. Time passes, I am not sure how long the boiler was out at Abby's dorm but I am guessing more than a week but less than a month, and now Travis has to find a way to keep her from going back to her own place because... Yeah I have no idea what he saw in her or what she saw in him. Every time Travis started beating on a victim I expected someone, anyone to call the cops, campus security, men in lab coats that have nice padded rooms for rent? Maybe not the group of people that sit at that same table at the same time every day but the staff. Heh guess that was asking for a little too much reality. I also felt like when it was first written this book had taken place in a high school not a college campus. A really, really bad high school where none of the adults notice that nearly the entire student body is made up of drunks. To be honest there were parts of this book that cracked me up, though I am not sure that was what Jamie McGuire was going for. The part where America accuses all the females hanging around Travis of having daddy issues, the part where Abby asks if Travis has always worn a condom and then takes his word for it, the part where he punches some random guy for wanting to dance with her and ends up knocking her on her butt and she doesn't drop him like the bio-hazard he is. I felt like the book should have ended when they finally pulled their heads out of their sphincters and got together but then wait that would make it a short story not a novel, let's throw in a completely out of left field twist and go to Vegas weeeeee! The break up should have gone more like \\"Travis, you're a controlling, violent, co-dependent schmuck and I will wear whatever I want whenever I want!\\" And the book should have ended there, or with a scene of them both seeking counseling. Definitely regret buying this mess.throw in a completely out of left field twist and go to Vegas weeeeee!

0312641893|5.0|This book blew my mind from the moment I picked it up and started reading it I couldn't put it down I practically pulled an all nighter reading this book. I'm so glad I read it this book is WORTH all the hype its getting.<br /><br />Cinder is a futuristic retelling of Cinderella. It's about a girl who is a mechanic and works in a booth for her stepmother in the city of New Beijing. Theirs something different about Cider she is a Cyborg. And most of the time she tries to keep her cyborg side hidden because cyborgs are discriminated against.<br /><br />One day while she's running her Mechanics booth the Prince of New Beijing shows up to have Cinder fix his android that is not working. And from that day forward they keep meeting.<br /><br />The major plot point of the book was pretty predictable but I was actually okay with that it didn't take away anything from the book or my enjoyment of it.<br /><br />From the very beginning Cinder had me hooked, Marissa Meyer is as an author is truly gifted about drawing you in and keeping you attention.<br /><br />This book has everything Science Fiction, Action adventure, Romance. It has something in it for everyone! I recommend if you haven't picked up this book yet you need to it is a must read for 2012

0345803485|1.0|Christian Grey is controlling, into domineering sex, emotionally unavailable, a commitment-phobe, and refers to himself as \\"50 shades of f'd up\\".  Yeah, he's a real catch!  NOT.  I just kept thinking, if I had a daughter, I would be so sad if she accepted a \\"relationship\\" like this for herself.  He offers her nothing. He admits he is incapable of love.  He is controlling.  His anger frightens her.  Over and over, Anastasia overrides all her instincts in order to be with this guy.  I just don't get it.  Any woman who would settle for a \\"relationship\\" like this has huge self-esteem issues.  What is \\"HOT\\" about any of that???  There is a reason the author had to make Christian Grey an incredibly good-looking, extremely rich, talented and educated man. I just kept thinking Ana would not accept this whole situation if Christian were an average guy.  If an average Joe said he wanted to engage in a S&M relationship, and would never be in love with you, and you were constantly in tears about your relationship, you would run like the dickens right?? As far as I am concerned \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is setting feminism back about 50 years.  Young women need to know they are worthy of a lot more than this from a man.  You don't have to settle for something like this.  And this is NOT HOT.

B00846JV20|4.0|I like the idea behind this book, but wish it had been done a bit differently. First, some of the pictures of Star Wars wildlife look almost comical. The text is a bit too scarce. I thin the The Illustrated Star Wars Universe (Star Wars) did a much better job on this front, providing real art along with fascinating backstory. I still remember reading about the shapeshifting anthropologist. Also, this book needs a serious update, if only to include episodes II and III<br /><br />UPDATE: I bought the 2010 paperback version in the hopes that it had an update to include Episodes II and III. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's the same exact version as the 2001 book. This means no Boga and none of the creatures from the Geonosis colosseum. This is really a missed opportunity. The book itself has beautiful illustrations, but could have been so much more.
086571701X|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who is thinking about starting an aquaponic systems.  This book saves hours of online research.  I really enjoyed the inclusiveness of this book, it definitely got me on the right start.  I am in the middle of my build, only have plumbing and cycling left to do on my system. Maybe in a new edition of this book the author could speak about using solar tubes for natural lighting.  I haven't found much on using solar tubes for grow lights, I decided to use them in my garage to cut utility costs.  We'll see how well it works. Thanks for this great literary piece on aquaponics.
