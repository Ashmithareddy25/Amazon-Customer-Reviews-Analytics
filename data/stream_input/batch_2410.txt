1451668945|4.0|This book has so many of the features I love about Mary Higgins Clark's books: characters that seem real, loads of suspense, a fast pace, and a tightly-woven finish.  The plot has much to do with a catastrophic explosion and fire in a furniture factory.  Two sisters, Kate and Hannah Connelly, are very much at the center of the story, and Kate is badly injured in the fire.  A good deal of the story revolves around others in their family, as well as their associates, while Kate lies hospitalized, badly injured and in a coma.<br /><br />A few readers have expressed the feeling that there are too many characters in the book, and that they're difficult to keep track of.  The way that Mary Higgins Clark introduces characters--a chapter at a time without drawing initial connections between them--is typical of her style.  It isn't my personal favorite of the various ways of framing a mystery, but the author is adept at giving us just the right amount of background to each character.  The personal sketches make each character unique and memorable.  It works, but the reader needs to be patient at the beginning.  We know that Mary Higgins Clark will begin to build suspsense as soon as the many threads are exposed.  Enjoy the ride would be my advice.<br /><br />A few other readers have said that _Daddy's Gone A Hunting_ isn't one of the author's best mysteries.  I agree, but how many new mysteries can measure up to the best of Mary Higgins Clark? It's not quite in the league of _I'll Walk Alone_ or _A Stranger is Watching_, which are two of my favorites.  I think what made this one slightly less than perfect for me was the extremely short chapters in the latter part of the book, where we jumped so many times from character to character.  It was probably done in order to keep the pace moving quickly, and I don't doubt that Mary Higgins Clark is a master at judging how fast a plot needs to move.  For me though, this one risked being fragmented by the many skips.  This one isn't as chilling either as some of her books, but it's still an excellent mystery, well worth reading.  She gets the depth and details right, and she gives her fans a lot of pleasure.  Highly recommended!s chilling either as some of her books, but it's still an excellent mystery, well worth reading.

B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Still all the things I like about Star Trek.  Deep Space 9 feels more political than The Next Generation, but is still awesome.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I have to admit, I expected The Avengers to be good considering how word of mouth kept saying it was. But, after seeing it, I would say it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Joss Whedon did so well, they had better give him the keys to this franchise and let him do them all. There is no other director that I think could have pulled off having so many headliner actors in one movie and not have it fall apart. Every character shared the screen so well it was shocking. Robert Downy Jr. had his best performance as Iron Man. The thing that stood out the most to me and the one thing I was worried about was Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. No worries any more. He did the best job as Bruce Banner, compared to even Bill Bixby. Too many things to say about it, but if you like action, sci-fi, comic books or all three and you haven't seen this movie, go rent it, sit down and prepare to be blown away. Worth every cent and every minute!

B008Y6WF8W|5.0|Great fun. Cheesy cartoon violence. Edgy and dark story with more than decent plot. Very original.. loved it. Truly the first movie to employ comic book/graphic novel cinematography. Blazed the trail and set the standard for \\"300\\" and many others. This one though, is one of the very best of the genre it helped spawn.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is very enjoyable, but there are a lot of glithches and it can become very expencive very quickly. Many of the quests require you to use gems, which you can either pay for or collect very slowly through the game. one statue costs over $20, princess celestia is 900 gems, which is close to $90. The mini games are great and the game is well made apart from the glitches. It can still be enjoyable as long as you dont mind either spending money or not being able to get everything you want. Rainbowdash and Rarity also cost gems, by the way.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The game runs in real time. If you are impatient and want things to go faster it will cost you... literally. If you need more &#34;&#34;game money &#34; you can spend your own real money in the Jurassic Park market which will take you to amazon.com where you can buy more &#34;game money &#34;. However, if you are patient you can earn the &#34;game money &#34; in real time. It is slow but will keep your actual money in your pocketbook.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I don't know why I read this one after reading the first one, which I also felt was pornographic.  This woman is sick to stay with this man - he is sick too, but for her to debase herself this way is lowing all women in the eyes of each other and men.  Just my opinion.

B00797MB0O|4.0|We all know the perfect people in high school.  But really, who thinks about them after high school?  Only they do. In this painful, dark comedy, Charlize Theron nails the self-absorbed former teen queen who finds her best days are behind her.  She makes a complete fool of herself when she returns to her hometown.  In an attempt to capture her glory days, she totally miscalculates her relationships with all around her.  But its her pathetic attempt to regain her former boyfriend's attention that truly sinks her to a new low.  It made me squirm to see how the mighty have fallen.
B00CAJP0ZO|2.0|Usually I'd spend time writing a well thought out review.  But, I feel cheated by having a not-so-well thought out album.  With all the negative reviews, I listened to this album in its entirety on another site. I will admit that \\"Scream & Shout\\" with 'Britney, Bitch' is catchy if not lacking in lyrics.  And it saves the album from being 1-star, but only by a thread. I am a person who enjoys good, meaningful lyrics, but my guilty pleasure is the often lacking-in-lyrical-department pop that is catchy and keeps me moving.  And with this album, there is potential.  So much potential, especially with \\"Good Times Are Coming\\" and \\"World Is Crazy\\". Perhaps weaved into this is my bias that he had to resort to collaborating with Bieber and even worse, Chris Brown. However, this album leaves me feeling used and taken advantage of.  I like the artist, and I won't divulge in the musical plagiarism debate that other reviewers are discussing because I can't get over the abundant use of auto-tune.  I'm sick of it. Where Is The Talent (Elephunk reference)? I'll wait for this to go on sale dramatically (more so than $5) before I'll consider purchasing.  #willpower, in my eyes = #willfail.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|I would have liked to have given this book a 5 star rating, but because of the \\"dark\\" storyline and the overdone language I just couldn't. Although it kept me guessing and reading it through until the end, it was a bit depressing.

0785151303|4.0|\\"Thor: The Art of Thor The Movie\\" is a nice book, particularly if you like to see behind-the-scenes concept art. As a person who dabbles in artwork and a superhero comic fan, I'm fascinated with the thought processes with the development of what the audience sees in the final product.<br /><br />Like with his fellow Avengers, it is nice to see a combination of the classic Marvel appearance with some real-world practicality. As much as Thor's helmet is essential to his comic book look, it would be difficult for that to work effective in a movie adaptation without it flying off (hence, the paneling around Chris Hemsworth's ears). The problem is that it looked more ceremonial than practical.<br /><br />I'm glad that the classic Mjolnir was kept, particularly when looking at some of the of designs. While some of the designs were interesting, it just seemed unnecessary given they added nothing that could be considered an improvement. In fact, some of the designs looked impractical (such as the long-handled version in the concept still art of Thor).<br /><br />Personally, I liked some the design sketches for Sif's costumes. To me, I wondered how the movie was going to make her armor look practical but yet with a feminine touch. More importantly, it made Jaimie Alexander's Sif look like a respectable warrior, instead of the at-times scantily dressed eye candy as she appears in the comics.<br /><br />My only negative commentary does not deal with the product itself (although some pictures seem to be lower scan resolutions) but the amazing upshot in price. When I bought this book through Amazon in late March 2013, it was priced in the $50 to $75 range (still higher than the prices for the art concept book for Iron Man II, Captain America -- which came out the same year as Thor's book -- and The Avengers). Now as I write the review, the book is being sold by resellers for a minimum of $125 to as much as $900. Even the used books are starting out at more than $200 and going ashigh as $900.<br /><br />I understand the owner has the right to sell a book for whatever he or she feels is fair market value, but no rational person is going to spend nearly $1,000 for this book. It's evident that Marvel Studio's publishing leg is not printing more copies, but resellers may as well not offer the book for sale if that is what they want. Moreover, the demand should be an indicator that Marvel should consider reprinting more copies.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a great match three game.  If you go very far, like some other reviewers said you have to pay.  It is only $1.99, though,  and I think it 's well worth it. I usually get bored with m -3, but this one is enough of a challenge to keep it interesting.  It is well worth the money and by the time you finish the demo, you 'll know if you want to buy it.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Written well.I bought this book,since it supposed to deal with paranormal matters, which interests me. The Author answered all the scientific questions, in a methodical way.Normally the scientific details and good narrations do not go well together. But here Dr.Eban managed this task well.At times, even going detailed way into scientific matters, boring  general readers like me, he was carefully handling the narration.Overall it is a good attempt to retain and reproduce all the details and experiences which occurred during coma - Near Death Experience (NDE)

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is not as good as the first one (in my opinion). It seems like Katniss spends the whole book wondering about what would happen...how would it happen...etc. But, what I did like was that she takes risks, and she goes back to the arena with other champions. Also, Katniss does not trust some people in the arena, like Johanna Mason. But in the end, it turns out that the wound that Johanna did to Katniss was to help her get her out of the arena. I would recommend this book.

B009MO5E10|4.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Wilee (Coyote?), a Manhattan bicycle messenger. Wilee is to deliver an envelope. The envelope happens to contain something unusual, something that scenery-chewing Michael Shannon's character desperately wants.<br /><br />The thin premise of director/co-writer David Koepp's film works up to a point, as long as the film's story keeps moving on, with bike chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. \\"Premium Rush\\" benefits from nice stunt work and effective editing, as well as the on-location cinematography of Manhattan.<br /><br />But the film uses one or two too many flashbacks in following the back story of those who got involved with the envelope. With an exception of Michael Shannon's enjoyable performance, there is not much in those flashback parts that are really interesting.<br /><br />An unpretentious fun movie, \\"Premium Rush\\" delivers what it sets out to deliver, though this could have been done a little faster.

0374531269|4.0|In A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier, Ishmael Beah tells us about his tragic story as a young boy soldier in Sierra Leone. As a twelve-year-old boy Beah never thought much about the civil war occurring in his country that is until he is affected by it. The war causes a great amount of chaos to everyone including Beah who loses his family and struggles to stay alive. It is difficult to read about drugs, rape, war, and murder from a child's perspective but nonetheless it is a great read.<br /><br />While reading this book one may feel sympathy about what other people, especially children like Beah, have to endure in different parts of the world but we fail to realize that this is globalization. It is occurring everywhere and is not a myth. In the memoir there are a couple of circumstances where people didn't think much about the war and just brushed off the issue until it affected their loved ones. And even then, those who tried to deal with the issue at hand did not have a full understanding about the war. We have this attitude of \\"West vs. Rest\\" but again, we have to understand that this is reality and it is occurring all around us.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this memoir and I would gladly recommend it to classes on globalization because while it touches on globalization issues there is a story, a real life experience, behind it and I feel that helps students understand the gravity of globalization.

B007THA4FI|4.0|If you are looking for another story in the style of Harry Potter, look elsewhere. This is a very adult title about a small town in England, complete with all of the small town politics, backstabbing, and pettiness. It is not a light hearted novel, and the good guys don't necessarily win.<br /><br />It took a little bit to get into the story, as Ms. Rowling had to fill in some of the necessary town &#34;history&#34; for the reader to understand the present. But once you had that backdrop, it was interesting to see who was going to do what next.

Mary is at her best with truly believable characters and situations that leave us questioning whether people are telling the truth or lying. You will cry when you hear about the missing people who are found  dead and shocked by who did it.  A must read and I suggest you give yourself some free time cause once you start you wont be able to put it down.<br /><br />You will be guessing till almost the last page what are the secrets they are trying to remember and most of all who really did it?
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Good Grisham story woven around a set of characters that you would like to hate, but are so bumbling that they endear themselves to you.  A kind hearted central character keeps it real.  A rather light-hearted book for Grisham, that it easy to read. I enjoyed it immensely.

B005HEDIHG|4.0|I like the orginal Star Treck series very much.  The characters work well together.  By today's standard the equipment is &#34;hoaky&#34;, but this was the cutting edge in the early 60's.  Think how our cell phones closely resemble the &#34;communicators&#34;, and our military now has lazers just as the Enterprise then.

B00BHU9BV6|2.0|If you want a real romantic, period piece, watch A Royal Affair instead. Same beautiful costumes, with a much less rushed story line, acting up to par, and much more elegant scenery. The whole film is set to look like it's on a theatrical stage, which in turn also showed up in the acting. Much too melodramatic for my taste. While Tolstoy was sometimes dramatic with his writing, the dialogue came off almost corny and way too forced. Thoroughly disappointed with this movie. But then again, I'm not a professional movie critic!
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I enjoy Zac Brown. I would recommend to my friends. Reminds me of Dave Matthews Band, with his own twist.
B000IZ0KRK|5.0|Even though we all know what happens in the end, every second leading up to it was wonderful. I absolutely love this movie! Helena Bonham Carter is, of course, amazing. If you want to see a truly romantic period film, I definitely recommend this one!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I enjoyed the animation and the story of love between mother and her daughter. I would recommend the movie highly.
B007WPLZAK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! The perfect romance film, in my opinion. You can always count of BBC to produce wonderful films and this one definitely lives up to the expectations. Redmayne and Posey are wonderful together. If you're looking for a great romance movie, look no further.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is a very good book because it has everything a dictionary should have.<br />My family has enjoyed having this book to do work.<br />I,Jordan Rowe would require this book to the public
B005BGBPBG|3.0|Enjoy these actors which made the movie watchable. Was just okay for me though. Pretty good time waster. Not bad.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie reminds me why I've worked in the law biz for over 30 years - the puzzles, the people, and the predicaments.  And the absolute fun of having &#34;a plan come together&#34; with all those moving pieces.
0060763280|5.0|[...]<br /><br />I belong to a \\"mastermind\\" group that has a book reading component. We read all kinds of books, business, leadership, motivational, technology, etc., and then one fateful quarter, I had to read one about my \\"millionaire mind.\\" I should first say, that I am an excellent money manager while also being uncomfortable with making a profit.  Once I have money, I seem to know what is best to do with my money, but I hesitate doing things that would make me money.  This reality is probably the main force behind me not wanting to read this book at all. I don't feel like I have a millionaire mind and am not certain that I need one - until I read it.  Millionaire Mind is split into two parts - 1) How have you learned about money, your Money Blueprint and 2) The Wealth Files which share stories and advice around 17 typical excuses and scenarios where wealth can be problematic for readers.<br /><br />A Money Blueprint is imperative to understanding yourself, partners, roommates, or anyone that you have to share finances.  Hoarding, bad investments, giving or spending it all, saving for a rainy day, and the emotional feelings attributed to \\"rich\\" people dynamically impact how one is with money. Speaking for my own Money Blueprint, I learned that striving to be rich was important, but that it is really hard to get and stay rich. The only way to get rich is to work really hard and the only way to stay rich is to be greedy. This set up and continues to set up a binary that I may not be rich, but I am not greedy. There is also a difference between being rich and personal wealth. I remember lots of moments in my childhood where there was an accumulation of material goods in my family - we looked rich - however I also remember it all slipping away, returning cars to dealerships, not having savings for emergencies, canceling family vacation plans, and completely falling apart at the death of my mother. Wealth provides a sense of freedom where, for some, having money comes with responsibility, obligations, and limitations.  I also learned a spending habit that doesn't allow me to have long term planning or savings goals.  As soon as I get money, I immediately spend it because it might go away.  See the disconnect here - of course it will go away - I just spent it!  Millionaire Mind has helped me identify these blueprints so that I can re-write them to support a more stable relationship with money leading to wealth. This programming leads to Thoughts that lead to Feelings which lead to Actions. It is through awareness that I can better understand my actions, disassociate myself with previous programming that I no longer support, so that I can declare myself a money magnet and make wealth-based money decisions.<br /><br />The Wealth Files seem to engage and answer all of the misgivings, doubts, excuses, and fearful conversations in my head regarding my inclinations or lack thereof to acquire wealth. \\"Buying things for immediate gratification is nothing more than a futile attempt to make up for our dissatisfaction in life.\\" This might have made sense prior to reading the book, but I wouldn't know what to do about it. I also feel that I would have gotten defensive at someone calling me out on my dissatisfaction in my life. Who the hell do you think you are? The author is wealthy. He is clear that there are lots of other factors that contribute to one's ability or access to accumulate wealth. Eker isn't targeting audiences other than me. The idea of the Wealth Files is that for those like me, I have my basics covered and I want more. I have been trapped in a \\"once I have ____ I can do ____ and then I will be _____.\\"  A Millionaire Mind is about flipping this story on its ear and BEING _______ so that I can DO _______ to HAVE _______.  There are loads of resources, declarations, and words of encouragement to help the reader make this switch.<br /><br />Jessica Pettitt is the \\"diversity educator\\" your family warned you about. Through teaching, writing, and facilitating tough conversations, she has figured out how to BE the change she wants to BE.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love being able to see the entire season at one time.  Excellent portrayal of a time we can only begin to imagine.
0385528752|5.0|[...]<br /><br />Holy crap!  So let's first be clear - I read a lot!  I mean A LOT!  I try to only read one book at a time, but I knock out maybe 4-8 books a semester (not counting summer as a semester this would be closer to 10-12). I was given 3 books to read as part of the Association of Fraternal and Leadership Values (AFLV)'s meeting, The Gathering.  Switch knocked my socks off. There are lots of books out there that help a reader know when they need to change, Unstuck: A Tool for Yourself, Your Team, and Your World, by Keith Yamashita & Sandra Spataro is a GREAT example. Also, there are books written to explain why change is important, why it scares some people, and how to implement change. This makes me think of Change or Die by Alan Deutschman.  Switch gets to all of this while also getting change out of the reader's head.<br /><br />If you haven't read the Heath brothers' first book, Made To Stick, I recommend it - literally it is a follow-up to The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm Gladwell. Both books have an approachable easy style that really kick the reader in the pants. There is no room for excuses or dilly dallying and really - they even seem to make me want to do something. Really.<br /><br />What makes Switch different than other \\"change\\" books is that it already assumes that change is hard. This book doesn't stop at the difficulty or turn into a cheerleader to redecorate the change at hand so that the fearful person gets tricked into changing. No. Switch breaks down the resistance to change into three parts: emotions, analysis, and method. These three parts are the underlying elements of the metaphor of a big massive elephant (emotions), the willful rider on top holding the reins (analysis), and the path of the journey (method). This is the clearest description of my own resistance to change that I have come across. After reading Switch, I don't feel bad about this truth, I actually understand my own resistancebetter and how it changes by circumstances. Let's look at iTunes as an example.<br /><br />Buying music online can be technologically challenging for some. I, myself, struggle to stay on top of new artists, and typically just hope for a good radio station. I also have old cassette tapes, records, and CDs, that are difficult to cart around with me, so eventually I converted to an iTunes user. The \\"elephant\\" is that I miss reading lyric sheets and being able to tell you where I was with each album I purchased. The \\"elephant\\" isn't excited about logging in and clicking a button. The \\"rider\\" loves the portability of iTunes and the organization of songs, albums, artists, etc., by genre, most played, recently added.  Purrr, my rider says. It is the path though that really pushed me over the edge. The path, or ease in which iTunes made me converting to its system actually won over my elephant. Sure I still miss reading lyrics, but the \\"if you like this artist, you might like this artist\\" function introduces me to new artists and the Genius function sets play lists from my own music collection while incorporating new artists. Then if that couldn't get better, if I like any of the new stuff, which usually I like most it, with one click of a button, I can add the new music to my collection with no wait.  The path to new music and my collection gets even easier when it automatically syncs with my iTouch. This feels efficient which makes my rider happy while my elephant gets to enjoy the \\"Oh! I remember this song!\\" or \\"Wow! I really like this band!\\" moments that keep me engaged with my music collection. All iTunes did was clear the path.<br /><br />Jessica Pettitt is the \\"diversity educator\\" your family warned you about.

B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I gave this only 3 stars because it was not included in my Prime membership and I had to pay quite a bit to watch it.  If I hadn't already watched season 1 and 2 (free with Prime), and wanted to prepare for season 4 . . .  I would not have paid $15 to watch this season.<br /><br />Although it was my choice to do so, I felt gouged.  $15 is a lot to pay for a rerun of something that was free on TV a little while ago.
B0082PQ93C|5.0|[...]<br /><br />So I am usually a painfully slow reader -- this somehow doesn't apply to Harry Potter or now Henrietta Lacks. A friend, Scott, gave me this book several years ago as it was UCLA's common read and I hadn't read it. It stayed in my pile for a long long time. I finally picked it up and -- well, literally couldn't put it down.<br /><br />When writing book reviews, or reading them, the cliche of \\"couldn't put it down\\" gets used a lot. This is what I mean: I fly all the time -- I get window seats so that I can sleep uninterrupted. I started this book waiting for a flight out of San Francisco and read it cover-to-almost-cover before landing in Philadelphia. Finished it before I turned in my rental car the next day.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot is fresh, funny, endearing, feisty, and determined to uncover the truth of Henrietta Lacks. As revolutionary as genomes have been to science, Skloot's writing is accessible and like strands of DNA are delicately woven with conspiracy theories, faith, segregation, racism, silence, abuse, and wonder, exploration, and new frontiers. The pain of living in segregated neighborhoods and work spaces is something that I bring into my daily conversations with folks, but I hadn't even considered how segregation, racism, ignorance, and hate impacted communities of color, the poor, and rural residents who seek health care (physical or mental).<br /><br />As generosity gives way to patent law, science has evolved, as has our desire to turn a profit and own information. It is imperative that this be a common read for us all. No matter how long the book may sit on your shelf, it pales in comparison to how long the Lacks family will continue to wait for the recognition that their mother unknowingly donated to all of us.<br /><br />Jessica Pettitt is the \\"diversity educator\\" your family warned you about.

B004478AS4|4.0|This well-known book is well worth reading. The characters are strong and the story moves right along, albeit with some shocking scenes.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Nice story, good graphics, easy and simple mechanics, fun and challenging<br /> puzzles, bug-free code.  But.  The difficulty of the puzzles is very wide, most of the puzzles are simple to moderate difficulty, but several (7-8 out of 80-81) are quite tough and of those 2-3 are just nearly impossible to score three stars.  Also, for a non-free game,the nagging (to buy/try other Playrix games,and to write a review) is a bit excessive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Starting reading this series because my kids both wanted to read it. Ended up finishing all three books in a few days. Some things didn't wrap up and work like I'd hoped, but it was a good book. Looking forward to seeing how they transfer what's in the books to the sequels being released in the movies now.
1401324649|5.0|So you wake up one day, on your 100th birthday no less, no family, all your friends passed on, stuck in some horrible and dull room in some horrible and dull nursing home with staff to match, waiting for some awful party to begin. Allan Karlsson, being rather sprightly for his age, as he has done so many times during his long life, makes a command decision, simply jumps out the window in his brown jacket, brown trousers and brown slippers, and runs away. Well, walks away as fast as his 100 year old legs can carry him.<br /><br />What follows is just yet another adventure in the really quite incredible life of this Everyman for the twentieth century with a genius for bomb making and love of vodka. In fact vodka drives many of the decisions he has made in his extraordinary life, even now at 100!<br /><br />What happens to him and how he lives out his remaining days is told alternately with how he has lived the previous 100 years. In a life even more ridiculous than Forrest Gump's, and way more interesting than William Boyd's Logan Mountstuart, Allan meets more leaders from the last century than you can poke a dead stick at. In no particular order Stalin, Kennedy, Franco, Truman, Johnson, Mao Tse Tung and his wife, de Gaulle, Brezhnev and others. As you would expect his travels take him all over the place too - Sweden, USA, USSR, Indonesia, Korea, France, China, Spain...  How does all this happen - well, you will just have to read this book and find out. Gives new meaning to the song 'I've Been Everywhere Man'.<br /><br />Even though his past life is completely nuts, his present life, ie what happens after he disappears from the rest home, is just as ridiculous. It is really quite marvellous how he manages to stay only a step or two from those searching for him, and if we could all live such a life at 100, what a great world it would be!  The author must have had such enormous fun putting this story together and you have to wonder just where all this comes from!<br /><br />This book is totally and completely and utterly mad, enormously entertaining, with a 20th century history lesson thrown in for good measure. If you want to find inspiration in how to live the rest of your life, you could get an idea or two from this insane account. If nothing else you will get a jolly good laugh, and that is no bad thing either, whether you are 100 or not. Keep up those yoga and pilates sessions so you too will have the strength to climb out that rest home window.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book combines statistics, anecdotes and plenty of research into why we can't assume laying low is the best approach to continuing or foremothers' plight for equality. What I appreciate most about Sandberg's approach is that this book is a challenge to men and women to rethink what it means to be a feminist (a word most of us don't really adopt). Women are a huge part of the problem in perpetuating gender stereotypes, and this book makes it clear how we need to reshape our thinking. All of us!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Perfect for young adults--not just those entering the fifth grade.  I suggested it for friend going into third grade--and that her mother read it with her.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun!! It teaches responsibility and its just interesting to play around with the horse. You can enter competitions, win prizes, win gems and money to groom, feed, treat, and dress up your horse. You can also buy more than one horse which is double the fun!!! You should totally get this app.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|The realizm is startling.  It leaves you wondering at times if it has real actors in it in addition to the CG action.  Fun story, great action.
B0060MYK7G|2.0|The second season is amazing. Amazing beyond words.<br /><br />However, there is a huge problem. Showtime screwed up. DVD's are defective. Not just from Amazon, and I've gone through 8 sets of the show. From retail, to online.<br /><br />If watching on Widescreen, there are flashing lines that show up and will continue to keep flashing and are very easy to notice. It's horrible.<br /><br />Amazon has stopped selling the product, so hopefully it will be fixed.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Kind of lame, but OK for an evening of escape.  Not too much thought required to watch the show and follow along. Good guys against bad guys, and you can tell the difference (mostly).
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Well written and a real human interest reading.  Very smooth read with deals of the horrific experience lived by both non-professional and professional people of the North Korean society.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is my personal favorite Bond next to Tim Dalton, and for good reason too just about everything about the film feels retro,yet modern.I don't want to say too much without giving anything away how the characters interact with each other and some really good fan service are what I mean about classic Bond especially the revelations at the end of the film.Once you get past the product placement this a great movie overall.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i can not put the game down...except when i'm so frustrated and yell out that it's too hard, scaring the dog and my hus and.  so i play a couple games of upwords and then i'm back to quell again.  sometimes i don't know how i got all the pearls in the end.  i love this app.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|Good for friend chat, checking updates or game news. I found it very useful.  I also used it to check if they released the DLC I was waiting for.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Visually stunning but the story kind of drags on a different parts.  We enjoyed it but probably wouldn't buy it on BlueRay.
B004US4K2C|3.0|This is a good app but it is a resource hog. It eats the battery up it just a few hrs. I had to carry a charger with me everywhere I went
B00785P2QC|4.0|The only thing i dont like is the ticket cost  on the game to much for a little the buy them is to expensive as well.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was entertained, enjoyed and would recommend for others to read. The provided photos were interesting and glad they were used.
B008220DGE|1.0|This movie is unbearable. The acting may be good at times, but the story is boring and very slow. I feel asleep so many times, that I can't even tell you how boring this movie is ... I could not take it no more and went to bed, so I gave this movie up. Stay aways from this!
B001NLKXK2|3.0|Read this for book club and ended up with a great discussion. Odd arrangement with Alice's family members and other subjects mentioned in book.
B001BFFTO0|1.0|this boot is worth about $30.00 walmart sale, boot falling apart after 60 days sole comming apart and side of boot pulling apart.used in every day lite work getting in and out of truck working in stores will not buy there boots agin
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok this gameis awesome. No need to explain that. The update is coming soon for alpha 6.2 right now theres going to be cake and buckets and breeding! Yay! Get this game for sure!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is such a great show! It should definitely have had more than one season! But at least there's a film to tie the loose ends!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I was looking around for an alarm clock app and tried many of them but this is really the best app there is. It has a timer, stop watch and alarm clock.
B008602KQI|2.0|With the special effects and great acting this movie was still a let down.  Unless you read the 3 books (which I didn't but my children did) you wonder why the story goes the way it does.  It gets a little ho-hum at times and looks like they had to fill in sections with parade-ish things but I wished I hadn't wasted time on this one. The ending...borrrrrr...ing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Shocking twist near the end! I would definitely recommend this whole series to anyone searching for a truly original story.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|After reading the first book in this series I knew I was hooked!! This book is just as amazing as the first!!! I highly recommend this book and the entire series!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app except the intensity block covers what you are trying to look at on the map and you can't make it disappear.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|There is little I could say in praise of this movie that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep it simple.  This movie is a masterpiece, a must-see.<br /><br />I do have friends, however, who watched maybe 5 or 10 minutes of it and decided they didn't like it, or it just wasn't their type of movie.  So I suppose if dialog-heavy, symbolism-heavy, thought-heavy movies aren't your thing, you should probably stick to what you know you'll like.  I know that sounds pretty condescending, but I will admit that not every movie is for everyone.<br /><br />If you're willing to watch a movie and think about why people do what they do and how differing viewpoints can change the meaning of an event (though that theme is a bit more subtle), then if you haven't already give this movie a watch and prepare to not only be entertained, but to be enlightened.
B00821OX98|4.0|lots of action, the main characters are interesting and believable. The special effects are not over done. Very suspenceful. It was great.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Great movie and concert DVDs. Great to see Maiden behind the scenes. They really still have it after all the years.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love the Good Wife! I DVR the current season and watch previous seasons on my kindle while running on the treadmill!
B00506NRBS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It's one of the few that I looked forward to picking up to continue. The writing style is very honest and personal. Derek shares his experiences, thought process, and lessons learned while starting and running his company.<br /><br />It felt like I was sitting with him for a coffee and listening to him share his thoughts.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|We purchased this movie after seeing it in theatres.  What a wonderful movie!  It's a dramedy that we've recommended to all of our friends.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loooove this game! have lost days while playing this g&aacute;me..... and its free.  it gets 10/10 from me hands down!
1936608898|5.0|Great explanations about how various foods affect our bodies and alternatives for becoming healthier. Combine the ideas in the book with other suggested resources to find delicious recipes.
B0063IH60K|4.0|but it is so convenient to play on the kindle. I would give it five stars except for the ads but they are not too bad for a free game.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|the controls are non responsive and not even car like. there are no instructions either. and the levels are way to hard at the beginning. you have to be really patient to do a level. not my idea of a fun game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, hard to put down, great summer read.  An excellent twist on a murder/psychological thriller.  You won't be sorry you bought this book.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Pretty cute hangman game.  Funny graphics too.  It's a kind of fun way to pass the time with this game.  So far it's been pretty simple words but I'm hoping they get tougher.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Love it. Has some great music and funny one liners. My two year old has watched it four times already and I'm not sick of it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Slow to start, but the rest makes up for this.  Lots of great ideas from the forefront of science stirred with great imagination.  After 1/3rd through, couldn't put it down.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The movie does a great job at the accuracy of the book. This is a must see and a must read book!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|May be a bit PG -13, but kids love it! Requires a lot of hand/eye coordination, so their brains are constantly busy.
B008602KQI|4.0|I knew nothing about this except it title and having viewed a couple ads.  Bizarre scenario with some weird personalities and to me gave an interesting insight as to what is now popular with those much younger than myself.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|great value for the money. entertaining, fun, challenging and at times frustrating! highly addictive! I would leave more reviews if they didn't have minimum word counts.......
B001EN71DG|4.0|This is a review for the Star Wars Widescreen, Theatrical Version of Episodes IV, V, and VI. The box has Luke and Darth Vader clashing light sabers with a blue background. I already own episodes I through VI (special editions)on Blu Ray, and I bought this set on DVD specifically for the theatrical versions. Buyers should be aware that the theatrical versions are only on the bonus discs, so don't buy a set that is missing a bonus disc if your goal is the theatrical versions. Also the Aspect Ratio is 2.35 to 1 for both the special editions and original versions, but the special editions are enhanced for widescreen 16:9 TVs, whereas the orginal versions are in 4:3 letterbox format. This was a disappointment for me, as it put black boxes on the top and bottom of my 16:9 screen and overall made the picture smaller. But apparantely this is as good as it gets for the original versions on DVDs. You should also be aware that the only other item on the bonus discs is a Xbox (original) demo version of the Star Wars Lego game. I hope this helps with your purchasing decision.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I disliked this book because it stinks like poop and I will never read this crap again! NEVER EVER AGAIN.
B00AZF13KG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and the price was incredible especially since I couldn't find in stores like Target, Walmart or Best Buy!
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This music gives you the feel of the emotions in the movie with out having to watch it. Great soundtrack!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Well titled, for it is on the &#34;fringe&#34; of being believable, but there is just something about its quirkiness that keeps me coming back for more. Sometimes it so pushes the believability boundaries to the point of being laughable, but if you can push past that, if you can suspend disbelief and allow the impossible to be plausible, you may enjoy this series, too. And frankly, most TV is unbelievable anyway, right? For escapism, this is ranks right up there with Star Trek Voyager, etc......Enjoy!
B006JCC1GO|2.0|It don't show which keys to play, for us non piano players.  If I could play the piano in the first place it might be ok.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|My three grandkids play it all the time. they love it and it keeps them happy and me peace of mind.
B008I43DYU|4.0|So far it's accurate for what I've used it for.  I've added, subtracted on it so far and it's ok.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written. I finished this book in one sitting. I love the history, I am seventy years old and had never heard of the orphans trains, and neither had any of my friends.<br />The best way to learn history, with a great story as the backdrop!
B008P1EWIM|3.0|I don't know how it does it, I guess it's hooked to the weather sat. or channel or something, but it works that's what counts.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|had problem downloading, but finally were able to install, will have to speak with the tablet manufacture on it later
B00139XTG4|5.0|This is a very good book. I think everyone should read it at some point in life, especially if you are a researcher.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|I owned this mulit-tool for a while and then I gave it to my son. The main reason was it's weight. I found it uncomfortable when I wore it on my belt. Later I purchased the Gerber 31-001047 Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Pack with Multitool, Flashlight, and Fire Starter, which I found a whole lot better. The tool has just as much as the 31-000749 Ultimate Milititool but a lot lighter. I recommend the 31-001047 over this one.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Soundtrack good. Have cast recordings, seen Broadway production and Movie last year. Amazing. all the productions. Hope to own the DVD of the movie soon.
1594744769|4.0|This book was a refreshing read. It's been a little while since I've dabbled in YA Fiction since I've been on a history and historical fiction kick, but this was a good choice to get back into the genre.<br /><br />No spoilers, so newbies to this series (yes, it is going to be a series) feel free to read on.<br /><br />Our protagonist is Jacob Portman, who is a stereotypical teenage American boy. Jacob grew up listening to his grandfather's stories from his youth as a Jewish refugee who escaped the Nazis to live in a home for special (i.e. \\"peculiar\\" children) on an island off the coast of Wales. Jacob's grandfather's stories were accompanied with a collection of old photographs of his bizarre housemates: a girl with two mouths, a boy covered in bees and a girl levitating. Once Jacob is in his teen years and knows better, he believes his grandfather's stories were nothing more than cheesy fairy tales. But when Grandpa Portman dies and Jacob believes he sees the culprit, a hideous inhuman and non-animal creature, Jacob shuts down and enters therapy. As he struggles with what he saw, he begins to question his earlier assumptions about his grandfather's stories.<br /><br />Jacob, his parents and his therapist decide it would be good for the grieving process if Jacob and his father (Grandpa Portman's son) travel to the Welsh island for closure. Jacob, of course, has the ulterior motive of investigating the home where his grandfather grew up and trying to locate the old head mistress, Miss Peregrine, who used to run it. It would be difficult to continue to summarize the plot from here without giving away some spoilers, but it should be obvious to everyone that Grandpa Portman's wild tales are proved true and Jacob ends up meeting Miss Peregrine's peculiar wards.<br /><br />This story falls into the vein of the superhero team story arc, which anyone who likes X-Men or the Avengers might enjoy. Any story with a band of superheroes or mutants or \\"peculiars\\" is bound to have some similarities. However, there are many different directions an author can go, and I feel Ransom Riggs offers an original and fresh take on what is becoming an overdone concept. What I like about the peculiars and their peculiarities is that they are relatively low-key, and most of them are not what we would identify as a \\"superhero.\\" Olive, for example, cannot fly but rather she is as light as a feather and would float away if she wasn't weighted down. Her peculiarity can come in handy but it's also a handicap. I think if you liked Heroes or Alphas, you will appreciate this aspect of the book.<br /><br />I think the novel's biggest strength is the way the children live in the home. To describe it further would be to give away what I think is one of the book's most clever twists, but I'll simply say I did not expect the book to go in this direction when I picked it up. It offers some very interesting prospects for the next installment. By the same token, the cover and YouTube trailer sell the book like it is a bizarre and creepy paranormal tale and that's pretty disingenuous. I'd say the book is in reality closer to the sci-fi genre than to paranormal or horror.<br /><br />All in all, the book was imaginative, fun and engaging. I gave it four out of five stars for story, characters and creativity. My holdout to giving it five stars was the writing. It seemed a little bland at times and left me thinking there were more compelling prose the author could have used. But like I mentioned earlier, I did pick this up after reading several historical fiction books so it's important to remember that the target audience for this book is teens and young adults. As a note on formatting, the book includes the creepy black and white photographs from Grandpa Portman's collection and I thought that was an excellent touch. I'd never heard of Ransom Riggs before this, and I think this was his debut work, but I was thoroughly impressed. I'll definitely be reading Book 2.<br /><br/>This review and other reviews are available at kevinmooreauthor.blogspot.com/>This review and other reviews are available at kevinmooreauthor.blogspot.com
B000JMKSE2|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly interesting, and especially relevant because I work in marketing where the notion of long-tail products and audiences have become increasingly more important. Definitely worth a read!

B0073XV2W2|5.0|I have really enjoyed Daniel Suarez's books since discovering him. This book keeps with the others in not letting me put it down. Since in real life drones are starting to make the move from military-only situations to local law enforcement and perhaps even the private sector, this book gives a thrilling look at what could go wrong.
B002APU580|5.0|so much enjoyed this version. the plot is essentially the same. but the characters are brought alive with these portrayers. was quickly drawn into the story. will watch again and again!

B00AQL8VU4|4.0|This is a great short cut for going to Amazon. The format is simular to the actual web site which makes it Real Easy if you have gone to Amazon.com before. I love the fact that this particuar app is made for tablet devices. In just one click your there, that is my favorite thing. A real time saver!

B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you like the TV show Game of Throwns you will love the books, you get all the backround that there is not enough time for on the show.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great acting, edge of seat viewing.Keeps you entertained and makes you part of the action.Review at first part of movie shows you why it happened.
0374275637|2.0|Daniel Kahneman is genius but this book has a predictable flaw of a volume written by an academic (not a writer), with one author (Amos) already dead. It ends up as as a lengthy compendium of multiple tests and studies. The ideas drown under the paper weight of modern, tedious scholarship.
B00A32GZOK|5.0|Please note that there are many reviews faulting the sound of this release, but these pertain to earlier DVD transfers.  The 2013 Bluray release features sound restored from the original tape masters and does not have the problem issues of the earlier transfer.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Good exciting read starring a person who could never be real. Same can be said for the next Robie &#34;The Hit&#34;
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|What a well-written and thought provoking novel that continues to surprise you chapter by chapter.  I'm often disappointed with both plot and character development in many of today's novels, but this is definitely not a flaw of this very enjoyable book.  Do yourself a favor and give it a read.
0316776963|1.0|The first chapter of the book is quite clever and entertaining, so I was looking forward to reading more. Unfortunately the book went downhill from there. The chapters are just stories of different parts of his life, not presented in any entertaining fashion. I read through as quickly as possible, hoping to find something humorous in it, but was unsuccessful.  Incredibly disappointed and will not be reading any other titles from this author.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game!! Challenging and engaging. Only problem: I want more!!  When will more chapters be available? I became totally addicted.
0470474874|5.0|I am not expert at Excel, and this book is always handy so I can remember all the cool stuff Excel does. I am an avid user of Excel and this book was perfect for me.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This could make a movie. It's really freaky. Well written. This psychological twists are interesting. I'm guessing where the &#34;cure&#34; lies.... But I can't be sure. Definitely going to read book 3.
B005ES12CS|5.0|I was the person who would never wear a pair of these shoes. But they are so comfortable. These duet clogs look a little clunky, but they are great. Pretty much any shoe made by Crocs is a perfect fit and very comfortable.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Once again Ang Lee has put heart and soul into a work which we can cherish forever. Brilliant acting and FX. Great for showing kids strength and courage.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I bought this for my collection when Amazon dropped the price to $15! Always look for Amazon to drop prices on TV Sets, they do, but don't tell you. I always keep an eye on expensive DVD's and games because one day they'll be $40 and the next $15, but usually for a 24 hour period. I'm glad I checked, because I had the money and now I have the first 5 seasons and didn't pay more than $15 for any of them!
B005RDF2RG|4.0|How can you not love Shrek? If you don't have it laying around anywhere this is the perfect way to get your Shrek fix.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fast action on the board. Match three or more and do it as fast as you can. It's also connected to Facebook so that you can race your friends. Great fun.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this movie is so cute. I'm twenty and I enjoyed it more than the kids I was watching it with. It's a great mother-daughter story too.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love it I own one on my ds. this is like it but better more fun then mine love it who could hate this 50. hate it
B002WY65VU|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I bought this for a friend for christmas because of how much she liked this movie when we first saw it. It came perfectly in tact and it was a great price.
0920668364|5.0|A great Story everyone can relate to!  If you don't have a tear by the end, then there is something wrong with your head!
B003B02O14|4.0|A fun and interesting read. Has a lot of twists but some are quite obvious. I still recommend th  book if you're a fan of Grisham's other books.
0439023513|4.0|First let me say: overall the Hunger Games series was phenomenal. Of course, the writing is geared to an audience younger than me but the storyline itself was great. It was also fun making the connections between the capital and our own capitalistic society and the body policing that goes on when Katniss has to play the part of a lover to Peeta for the capital's vewers. I'm sure these books would go over great in any middle school English class.<br /><br />As for this book in particular, it was a good wrap up to the series. However, I did feel like the end was a little rushed. We had three books that semi-detailed a war and in the end it feels like the actual war was won over a bit too quickly and easily. I wish Collins could have elaborated and embellished a bit more but, once again, there was a specific audience she was going for.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I absolutely love this show; definitely four stars, what a great season! I can't wait for what Season 4 brings!
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Great arm i have a 23 inch touch screen display on it works good has been strong for the past 5 months i swivel it many times a day and still strong. The only downfall is i wish the base was taller thats all.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I didn't know anything about the Queen before this movie. Well only what I've learned by watching other BBC movies. Such a strong, beautiful, family oriented woman. This movie prompted me to watch all the Victoria movies on Amazon Prime.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|One of the best shows on TV! Season one sets up each character nicely.  I'm almost finished with season three and the show gets better with each episode.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Loved the app, just didn't use it on my KFHD7<br />very much. I have it on my phone, thing is with<br />YOU need WIFI connections outside of the home<br />and when I'm on the go that is hard to find.
B0099116AY|4.0|How can you beat a movie with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones as the leading actors. This was a great movie, full of tongue in cheek humor. Don't miss it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think it is a good game for children like me,and when kids are or can't do anything they can this game.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|as soon as I downloaded it I was addicted. I like the graphics and the scenery changes. I highley reccomend to any one in the family
B008GWP2GG|3.0|This is spooky, suspenseful movie that should be fun for any X-Files fan, or anyone just looking for an entertaining UFO movie. I enjoyed it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This product is awesome. It does everything it states it would and protects my KINDLE FIRE HD I believe like no other case has. The case snaps snugly on my tablet and the leather feel is amazing. My best investment for my tablet. You can't invest in a better product
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show!  Exactly the type of show I enjoy.  The characters are flawed and well rounded.  All of them.  Great!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Wish I had more time. Iwatched it twice, and the time ran out before I could enjoy it again. Thanx
B009VB97EY|5.0|The story line doesn't start out that great but gets better and better. The dancing is fantastic and the movie is pretty funny too.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Luuuvvvved this so much, I watched it several times before I shared it with my 17 yr old grandson. He's a prodigy as well.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I enjoyed Harry Holes character, damaged, hardened by life, his addiction, but endearingly human. I found myself thinking of him as I would a family member or good friend, wanting to help him, knowing he needs to work it through himself, but appreciates you standing  by.  I was made aware of this author by a friend, who knew I enjoyed other authors from this Norse land area of the world, such as Henning Menkel, who was my first introduction to Scandinavian writers, next came Steig Larsson,and many followed,Karin Fossum,Karin Alvtegen and Jussi Adler Olsen to name a few mystery/detective/thriller writers and the original Danish version of movie/tv series, The Killing, called Forbrydelsen.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not give kudos to Don Bartlett as translator. He did a wonderful job, as the story reads smoothly. I only wish I could read Norwegian:)
B0090SI4LU|5.0|As someone who read the book prior to seeing the movie adaptation of The Host, I have to say that I had very high expectations going into the film. And, if I'm being totally honest, the film did not measure up to the incredible world created within the pages of Meyer's novel. That being said, however, I feel that it is imperative to also point out that movie adaptations of novels ALWAYS come with limitations. It is impossible to fully capture everything that makes the book great in the allotted two-hour timeframe of a typical movie. And The Host was certainly no exception to this rule. Still, I did find this movie to be entertaining and compelling in and of itself for a number of reasons:<br /><br />*NOTE: Spoilers ahead.*<br /><br />1. Saorise Ronan does a good job portraying two characters trapped in the same body. She accurately depicts Wanda's rigid, alien way of speaking, as well as throwing in a slightly southern-twinged accent for Melanie, who hails from Louisiana in the film. All in all, I felt that she was a strong female lead for the film.<br /><br />2. Max Irons gives an impressive, albeit limited, performance of Jared Howe. Irons was able to capture the struggle and hurt of Jared (caused by losing Mel and then having her body return with another soul inside) and convincingly portray those emotions on-screen. The only criticism I have about this character in the movie does not stem from Irons' portrayal; rather it stems from limitations in the script, which I'll explain in more detail below.<br /><br />3. The special effects in the film are really impressive. From the alien souls to the much-accelerated wound healing, the special effects are definitely one aspect of the film that cannot disappoint.<br /><br />4. The setting and the scenery in the film are phenomenal. Not only does the movie create an interesting and vivid look into the world of the Seekers and the Souls, but it also includes beautiful shots of the desert and, more importantly, the cave. The giant fields, hot springs, and especially the mirrors on the ceiling were perfect. The glow worms were a nice touch as well.<br /><br />5. Although physically much different than the seeker is described in the book, Diane Krueger does a great job bringing the relentless, spiteful seeker to life. (If you've read the book, you'll notice one drastic change in characterization toward the end of the film, but again, the fault cannot be placed on the actress, as it was scripted that way.)<br /><br />I think that the above reasons alone make the film worth watching. However, in the fairness of including a thorough review, I'd also like to point out the limitations.<br /><br />1. The characterization for certain key characters was a bit off. I mentioned about that I felt there were some limitations with the character of Jared. In the book he is rugged, a bit rough around the edges, but still funny. And he also cares fiercely about Melanie and Jamie. I feel like the movie reduced him to just the boyfriend who fiercely loves Melanie and wants her back; in just watching the movie, you don't get the full effect. The same can also be said of Ian, whose transformation from would-be-murderer to soul-sympathizer comes rather suddenly with little explanation in the movie.<br /><br />2. At times, the script seems a little stiff. It's not throughout the whole movie, just at certain points, but it still detracts a bit from the story.<br /><br />To sum up, the movie has a lot more positives than negatives. It is a well-made, compelling movie with a talented cast. I personally believe that the movie will be much more enjoyable if you read the book before watching the film. That way you'll be able to fully appreciate all the characters, even the ones whose personalities are not fully developed in the film. And I also recommend seeing it more than once. It's even better the second time around.
B000FC10MU|5.0|If you have never read this book you missing out, Gaiman is a master story teller drawing you in deeper ever time you read the next chapter. The mythology is incredibly believable and the characters so lovable you will have many a late night thinking just one more page before sleep. You will never want it to end.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|Alright, I have mixed feelings about this one. Overall, it's a beautifully written and filmed horror movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole ride. The only hard thing to stomach with this is the ending. Soooooo unexpected. And quite frankly, a punch in the face. But if an utter loss of hope and happiness appeals to you, you might not be so effected as I was.<br /><br />I must say, props to the directors for having the guts to make a movie this good and end it this way.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|The music is so different yet stayed true to their original sound. Love this band! A little bit of country sound on I hate to see your heart break and rock and roll on now.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|I'm a fan of &#34;uniqueness&#34; and this hits it. A fun, entertaining, and creepy story, all about learning to appreciate what you have. &#34;The grass is always greener on the other side,&#34; and for Coraline, she learns just how un-true that is.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I enjoy being able to stream the complete set of the the Good Wife series.  Netflix only offer s DVD's for rental.  Acting and story plots are done very well.  Only negative is occassion loss of video signal and rebuffering which may require a change in browser to recover the signal.
6305558167|5.0|Overall, this was a good film for it's time, the acting was decent, special effects reasonable, action scenes fairly well coordinated, and seemingly raw and a bit clumsy as if what it may have been in those times.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Pretty cool! I don't usually play games too much on my kindle but my little niece came over and asked if I had any games on my tablet. I figured it was free and it would make her happy. She started playing it and then I started and couldn't put it down for an hour! Fun stuff!
B0001NBMEE|4.0|For 1954, this turned out to be an entertaining movie. Very good for the &#34;family friendly&#34; collection.<br />Don't expect highly sophisticated action scenes like in Gladiator, seems more like stage acting done for a movie. I rated it 4 stars due to the dialog being too casual American rather than trying to remain closer to an old English period of language.<br />Interesting link with the King Arthur story. A good film to add to an Arthurian legends collection.
B0086700CM|4.0|Tried this out cause it was free. Great purchase, haha. Fun and keeps you on your toes. I would reccommend it anyday!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|They show in this DVD why they were the best rock and roll band in the world. All Led Zeppelin fans need to own this. A great addition to any Zeppelin collection.
0345534379|5.0|I bought it for my grandson (10 yrs. old) and he is really enjoying it.<br />My husband and I are enjoying it too.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I must say im somewhat upset. before the update it worked fantastic. now its constantly shutting itself down or not loading things. it has gotten to the point where I considered removing it.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This app is an adorable time-management game involving the wonderful characters of Disney's Finding Nemo.  The quests do an excellent job in steering you in the right direction and offering plenty of tips on how to maximize your reef's potential.  The time vs. currency gain/expenditure is appropriately balanced, I have not found myself waiting around for excessive amounts of time gaining currency for my next purchase, which is good.<br /><br />The reason I can't get myself to rate this game more than three stars lies not in the gameplay but in the technical difficulties I have had with the game.  Since I downloaded it a few hours ago it has force closed twice and frozen once to the point of making me reboot my device in order to recover from it.  With this many bugs, I can't see myself playing it much longer before I give up on it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was incredible. I am so glad I chose to read it. Very deep and much more complex than I would have imagined. I found I couldn't wait till my day was over so I can see what happened next with the characters. There is nothing better than a book you simply cannot put down.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|It's. fun and challenging without being frustrating (the followup is maddening!), and replayability is high. just good wholesome fun, no glitches or major frustrations.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Four-Disc Special) is wonderful. Any fan of these films should buy these!
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Guilty pleasure! Love the time period and acting. It just grabbed me what can I say. Just give it a try.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is easy to use and always with you when you are bidding on items. Also, better than searching on the internet because it shows the shipping price right below the bidding price. That way I don't have to click on the item to see the shipping items. I use the App all the time.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love this show. It's so interesting and the characters are all wonderful. I watched the first episode and that was it. Sold!
B0084670FU|4.0|The story line tie-ins were a bit out there to hold the movie together, yet this was a good movie.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Kendrick Lamar was someone who I'd overlooked; his guest spots on various songs hadn't done much to show his talent, and for the longest time I'd thought of him as nothing more than a Lil Wayne or Drake wannabe.<br /><br />And how wrong I was.<br /><br />This guy has talent. He's here to tell a story, and that's exactly what he does. Good Kid: M.A.A.D City is an album about growing up and finding yourself and staying on the right path despite all odds. It's a true hip hop album in the sense that, while it's certainly catchy, it's not overly mainstream and isn't trying to be. With the exception of the last track (produced by Just Blaze) the production here isn't overly flashy, putting Kendrick Lamar's lyrics front and center.<br /><br />And there's a lot to take in. I don't want to give away the surprises of what this CD has to offer except to tell you to listen to it yourself, paying attention to the lyrics and to the story, and forming your own conclusions. The lyrics, the flow, the narrative...at times it's nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Not every song by itself is perfect (Money Trees is a little annoying, and Swimming Pools, the lead single, doesn't really fit in, though in the album's context it works a lot better than it does on the radio) but the album as a whole is an incredible listen.<br /><br />Here's hoping Kendrick Lamar doesn't go mainstream on us and continues to release compelling, thought-provoking music like this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|very tricky and pages turner, made a beeline to the end once started even though don't like conclusion. like his style
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I haven't been able to turn this song off since I got it.  The style is similar to songs from Discovery, but is very fresh with the addition of Pharrell for the lyrics.  Without a doubt this is a song that makes you want to get up and dance.  My only complaint (barely a complaint) is I wish there was more synthetic vocals in the song.  Hopefully Daft Punk will release a version without Pharrell too.
B00881PTRC|2.0|Because it is upside down from rest of my apps. Screen is opposite of my other apps. Very inconvenient. Dissapointed
B008K9UZY4|3.0|It's ok and worth the money if you like classic sonic. The controls are ok but sometimes I find it frustrating. And the gameplay of going back in time and going to the future kind of suck. I did not like that to much at all. I like the Japanese soundtrack better than the U.S soundtrack. Yep they have both versions on this app! So if you like videogame music, then you will like the wide range of songs both Japan and U.S soundtracks.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|this was very entertaining.I have always liked cher.I wished there was more,maybe there will be.This was free,I would have paid
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|This album is packed with superb performance by great musicians.  It is diverse with foot stomping and smooth<br />Jams. Truly is a classic.
B00BTZNEN0|5.0|Wow, OneRepublic's new release is their best yet, in my opinion.  Several catchy tunes with strong lyrics, the band clearly spent the time to get this one perfect.  Preacher and Counting Stars are two of my favorites but every time I listen to it a new song sticks out.  Well done, OneRepublic.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is fun and addictive.  It keeps my attention,<br />and is interesting.  I would recommend this<br />game to anyone that likes this type of gaming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! But point a fact it's a RIPOFF!!!! But the game is still really good. If I could I would rate this game 99.99 stars!!!!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|This is an older version of Pride and Prejudice, shot mostly on set with 3 cameras but still a good one.
B00555X8OA|4.0|The main themes of this book are well taken...even though the recommended course of action to deploy them in a practical way is rather thin. One would also have liked to see the ideas linked up with those of Dan Spender who has an evolutionary explanation of the same phenomenon.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I thought it was great that you had the option of purchasing one episode or the whole season; it was definitely worth it !
B004G600A4|5.0|my daughter is very pleased with her new movie there was a delay in dilivery but that was the trucks fault
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I wanted to dodo in my pants when I got this app that's why I got this app<br />And I almost pooped my pants
B005GSZZ1A|1.0|Amazing story that is unbelievable. HIGHLY recommend . The story made me appreciate what I have been given living in the US
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It was an interesting story that I hadn't heard before, and I felt like Daniel Day-Lewis really brought Lincoln's personality to life. It was an excellent movie.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|The dialogue in many old movies is just amazing compared to what you see as of late. Even my daughter of 12 loved this movie. We will definitely be watching more classic movies.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Have you ever wondered why you are always sick?  You won't after watching this movie. A real jaw dropper. A nurse at the hospital<br />lent me her copy. I then ordered my own. Every American needs to see this. Our food is killing us.
B0095NCXKI|5.0|Very Funny, it a tv show that I enjoy. both the girls are hilarious and entertaining. its a must see!!!!!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This has enlightened me beyond belief. I have already started seeing the benefits from practicing the secret. I IMPLORE ANYONE AND EVERYONE in need of  spirit renewal or just a complete overhaul in your life to view and purchase this amazing book and/or movie!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I would like to thank Barbara Demick for this amazing book! Onece you start reading you can not put this boom away. Describes real picture of life in North  Korea...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Game circus LLC did a good job creating this game. It's like going to the circus without leaving home. Awesome graphics .
B005OAMYVO|5.0|I don't know how this man can continue to perform at such a high level--he simpy defies time; what amazing breath control!  As with his previous album, Duets:  An American Classic, the artists with whom he performed were, with few exceptions, excellent--a pleasant surprise since some were completely unknown to me.  The accompaniment was very polished and professional and leveraged the talents of the vocalists.  The genre of music--the popular standards of my folks' generation--contributed mightily to my delight and enjoyment and evoked the full spectrum of emotions.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't understand Marilyn Manson or considers him to be a \\"freak\\". You will be pleasantly surprised. Also anyone who needs to be reminded of who they are and what they stand for should give this a read. It really spoke to me and showed me that I should never be ashamed to be myself. Great book. He's a fascinating person worthy of the time it will take you to read his book and the money you will spend on it.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Actually, this was much better than I thought it would be.  The fact that there was too much sappy romance notwithstanding, I enjoyed it.  I just skipped the &#34;romantic&#34; parts.  All in all, not a bad read.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This is great software, but recently the Google  Drive Remote file access is not working. This forces me to use a competitor's software. I did receive an e-mail quickly explaining that they were aware of the problem, but there is no fix as of yet. With this fixed, it's a 5 star program.
B009X01FJS|5.0|This case is amazing.  I looooove it.  The kindle is really secure and the pink goes perfectly with my kindle.  The only thing that is not so amazing is that is kinda hard to rotate but I am willing to overlook such a small flaw.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is really an excellent movie...It really underscores the meaning of Christmas...<br />I have given excerpts to many family members...It will be in my group of all-time Christmas favorites...<br />Great that it's in DVD format...
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great story, great cinamatography. A movie for ages 6 and up. Mr Tiger may be a little too scary for younger kids. The opening screen saver clips of the animals has the best 3D effects but the rest of the moviw is equally great. Destined to be a masterpiece.
B0025KVLT2|4.0|I haven't received this yet...I did listen to a few songs before I purchased and they sounded very good...<br />The Beatles are &#34;classic&#34;...
B004GF244K|5.0|A beautiful concert for a beautiful soul. George has always been my favorite Beatle and oddly enough my favorite songs were written by him. The talent pool who performed his songs was unbelievable. Note for note perfect and true to the original version. If this concert was performed in the states I would have done everything possible to score tickets. Have watched it several times in the past few weeks....you will too.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|This movie is worthwhile to see. Funny and Light hearted! Great for Friday night movie! Fake Documentary Rockumentary movie . Enjoyable!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Fun and entertaining. I  couldn't put it down, a real page turner. If you love adventure this series is great.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was so great, could not put it down.  Loved the characters and I love Colleen Hoover :)  You won't be dissappointed, a must read!
B005HHSXP0|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the whole series of books. I couldn't wait to get to the next one. Always light hearted. The burden of winning the day resting squarely on the shoulders of our young heroes. Magical!
B005K17RU0|4.0|the weather app helps by keeping me informed if serious conditions exist.  this also gives the current tempature and conditions.  works well on the Kindle Fire.
B00433SVP6|5.0|I loved this book and all of the rest of the series too. Sprinkled with wonderful characters and witty humour.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I like the case a lot. It is a good value for the price. I would like it better if the Kindle was fastened in more securely. That is the only way it could be improved in my estimation.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|*ANY* film with these two actors is bound to be excellent.  Four stars because with any other actors this film would have been mediocre at best.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a excellent game overall. But the &quot;super shoe&quot; power up made me jump so high I often fell of the train I was on. Which left me getting run over. Also i wished there was a &quot;are you sure you want to purchase?&quot; thingie when I accidentally press something in the shop because I was saving up for the Sydney special but I accidentally hut someone I didn't want and that set me back 70000 coins. I was very mad with only 4 days left and 150000 coins when I needed 950000. But I still love the game even though I'm getting over the Sydney special problem. I strongly recommend the game it's lots of fun. ENJOY! (^-^)/
B000SLP4SE|2.0|It wasn't terrible but I still wouldn't recommend it.  I didn't like the ending and as much as I love Mark Walhberg, I think the movie might have benefitted from a different leading actor.  If your looking for a good Amazon flick, watch Lincoln Lawyer.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this is a pretty good game ...but does it have an end ...if it does how is it like....
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a sweet little game that is very thought provoking. I find it quite challenging. If you don't like being challenged this is not the game for you. The music can be a smidge irritating after a time but that is easily dealt with. Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think it is a pretty cool game....but I think temple run and temple run two are almost exactly the same...:) ...:/
B0072V394E|4.0|A great B movie, great spaghetti western and we loved it!  Hokey, yes, but good plot and lots of bad guys!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's the best game ever it halarious...and awesome and cool...sorta violent but amazing ...I would recommend this to everyone I know like forealz
B002MQYOFW|4.0|There is no way a movie can give you the history or the thoughts and feeling of the characters’.  It also cannot give you all the history for how the environment came about.  I find this makes reading a book better then the movies.  The movie gives you the special effects but that is so little of this book that I enjoyed the book more.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and was happy to hear they had made a movie. The movie was true to the book and was a blockbuster which should be labeled a Classic as years go by. I recommend both the movie and book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  I was disappointed in the ending but still....very enjoyable.  Intricate plot with lots of twists and turns.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Like this sweeper. Works well on floors but not so well on carpet. Great for quick clean up.  Would buy this product again & recommend it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is worth every penny, it creates a new challenge with each level and is highly addicting. I would buy it again and again.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|I am going to disagree that this series is running out of steam.  I think the fourth redeemed the series by giving us a sharper, flashier and a slightly better movie that it's predecessor.  Resident Evil: Afterlife begins with another narration by Alice followed by a depiction of the T-virus outbreak in Tokyo, Japan. In the fourth movie, Alice and her clones take the war to CEO Wesker (played deliciously with panache by Shawn Roberts) after dispatching the biologically-altered Dr. Isaacs at the end of Resident Evil: Extinction.  The movie mainly focuses on Alice looking for Arcadia and then finding out what it really is, helping Claire Redfield regain her memory after being controlled electronically, helping a group of human survivors who are walled up in a California prison and going after CEO Albert Wesker and The Umbrella Corporation. The confrontations and exchanges between Alice and Wesker are what keeps the story line going.  The prison battle scene with the seven-foot Axeman is scary.  Along the way, Claire is re-united with her brother, Chris and K-mart is rescued from The Umbrella Corporation's clutches.  We also find out that Officer Jill valentine who was last scene with L.J. and Officer Carlos Olivera rescuing Alice at the end of the second film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse has been captured and is now controlled by The Umbrella Corporation.  The ending tells everyone another film is coming.<br /><br />The script is not as good as the third movie's but the movie looks and feels great due to the incredible camerawork.  Yes, there are numerous 'matrix-type' scene rip-offs but they work.  There is no originality here but the film does hold your eye.  I enjoyed this movie because of Paul Anderson's style and movie-making skill and the performance by Milla Jovovich (now his wife in real life).  While I enjoyed it but it is not the strongest of the series.  it is still worth the viewing time.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I loved that, in the end, the movie showed that pride and selfishness can cause great pain, not only to others but to ourselves as well.<br /><br />Love, respect and loyalty win!
B000YPUF9W|3.0|Resident Evil: Extinction is the third installment in the horror/science fiction franchise.  This one opens up with a recap of her connection with The Umbrella Corporation's power and the T-virus narrated by Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Alice is seen roaming the desert of the US, dispatching zombies and more killer zombie dogs (including little terriers) and human trash.  Also in the desert, is a convoy of human survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) that includes holdover characters, Officer Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps) and several new characters, K-Mart (Spencer Locke), Betty (Ashanti), Mikey (Christopher Egan) and Slater (Matthew Marsden).  The convoy is in search of sanctuary which Alice confirms is in Alaska (largely due to a journal she finds at a gas station in the desert).  As they journey through the desert, the convoy survives a zombie raven attack and zombie attacks.  Although their numbers are reduced and a only a few survive, they battle a zombie army that has been re-engineered by the evil genius, Dr. Sam Isaacs (Iain Glen).  Dr. Issacs has been trying to copy Alice through clones and is informed by the 'Red Queen' ((Sophie Vavasseur) that Alice's re-engineered genetic make-up has made her blood the answer to his attempts to 'control' the zombies that were created by his T-virus.  Alice also now has telepathic and telekinetic powers which Dr. Isaacs wants.  We are also introduced to Albert Wesker, the evil CEO of The Umbrella Corporation who is manipulating the situation from his Tokyo complex.  The final scenes which feature a battle between Dr. Isaacs and Alice is great.  In the end, Alice picks up allies in the Red Queen and her many clones.  We see that the zombie infestation is now world-wide and that the Umbrella Corporation is still experimenting with using the T-virus for their own reasons.  Wesker hints at this in his order to continue the 'experiments'and tries to neutralize Alice's power by way of an anit-virus. We are given some hope by seeing that some survivors have escaped and have headed for Arcadia, the Alasakan human sanctuary.<br /><br />The film goes at a very fast pace and the action is eye-popping but there are few scary scenes.  Alice displays her incredible fighting skills as she leads the convoy to the destroyed city of Las Vegas Umbrella Complex.  The film's director Russell Mulcahy adds his panache to the movie and the script by producer (and often the director of the movies in this series) Paul W.S. Anderson is better than the second film.  Overall, this is a good science fiction film with great FX.given some hope by seeing that some survivors have escaped and have headed for Arcadia, the Alasakan human sanctuary.<br /><br />The film goes at a very fast pace and the action is eye-popping but there are few scary scenes.

B0018RC7QE|4.0|Streep and De Niro - excellent acting, surprise ending!  Why don't they make movies like this anymore?  Absorbing story without violence.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Definitely enjoyed this book.  I expected a simple romance- not even certain why I bought it  because I do not usually buy romance novels. Any way- I enjoyed the twist.  I dreaded the orphanage chapters (but that is why it was so good I think- she wrote in such a way that you felt 86's pain).  I would recommend to other as a good thought provoking read about loss and family.  It left me wanting to be a better person to others.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing in this role.  Maybe it was because I don't have a set mental picture of him that he truly was Lincoln in my minds eye.<br /><br />Sally fields is also exceptional in her portrayal.<br /><br />The movie did a good job of how 'All men are created equal' only applied to the ruling race then, and for many years to come, to this very day, in the minds of some.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|All little short but still a very fun game. I would recommend this game to anyone who like puzzle game.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a good family movie that has a great father/daughter story about letting go and allowing your child to spread their wings.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a must have game great fun I give this game 4 stars . You will love these games pamela
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This is a good adult movie. I didnt care for some of the language and it is a bit violent in some scenes. It does have a good story line and I would recommend it to friends.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Any Bond fan will LOVE it. Budget was an estimated $200,000,000! Javier Bardeem is awesome!  Can't wait to find out what happens to M!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love Clint and think his movies always tell a great story. This has a serious plot but uses humor throughout it. I would advice my friends to watch it
B005B19UPE|5.0|I had never heard of the Vel'd Hiv' roundup until I read &#34;Sarah's Key&#34;.  I found it an engrossing story while I learned some history.  That's a wonderful combination.  The author was able to let her characters come alive which is always a plus in a book.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Despite controversy surrounding this book, I consider it be one of the best inspirational women's books out there. Many thoughts and feelings I've had as a professional woman Sheryl echoes in her book. She encourages every woman to be who she wants to be, and for those of us who have our eye on the C-suite, she gives us the courage to really lean in and take it. Big applause for Sheryl Sandberg and Lean In!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I hope that more games like this one will soon follow.  It was challenging but intuitive, too short would the only negative.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|Fantastic movie, sci fi at its greatest by a great director! Loved every minute! Looking forward to his next movies too!
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is an older cd by Joe, and any Blues junkie will love it!!  After hearing it you'll understand why BB King took such an interest in Joe....
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|I still can't get this movie out of my head. I want it to go away!!!!!! Helen Hunt is ridiculous with that 'Boston accent.' I mean, don't they have dialect coaches on set???  And we're to believe she sits on this guy and has a big o? And then they're in love??? And Adam Arkin, what kind of role was this, he was in bed almost asleep the 2 minutes of screen time he had.  I wish I could give it negative 100 stars. It was icky, icky, icky!!!
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show is great at keeping you hooked.  I rate it 5 stars because of this but would warn not to watch it unless you have the time to waste.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Just not funny. Of course, I should have realized it was along the same lines as Family Guy, which I don't care for. If you like Family Guy, you'll probably like this movie as well
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Nothing like it on TV, original, brutal, and epic. One of the best TV has to offer. The finale is not to be missed.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great story line and despite the fact there was way too much \\"war\\" detail that made the reading rhythm unnecessarily slow, I like the characters so much I will move onto the next book in the trilogy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I never have any problems with my mall with Yahoo.  L always recommend Yahoo to friends. And I like to catch up with news via  Yahoo.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Very easy to maneuver and operate. Love everything about it. Just like a regular camera. Enjoy taking photos now. Magnificent
B009HEMJCW|5.0|I have loved James McAvoy since Becoming Jane. His Scottish brogue brought me in and it's the only reason I went to see Penelope. Thank goodness they cast him in a major role because otherwise I would have missed an amazing film! Penelope is billed towards children but I loved it as an adult. It's sweet and endearing and makes you believe in real love all over again.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|From the content of a few other reviews I thought this film might be interesting given its taunted mathematical theme.  However, there was no real mathematical content to support the story.  The main character, Max, never demonstrated any of the intellectual talent he was supposed to possess.  Instead he was in essence a mystic who believed in a predictable and understandable mathematical structure of nature but demonstrated only a superficial basis for such a belief.  Because the film had little substance, it had to inject Max's unsuccessful attempts to predict the price movement of individual stocks as well as touching upon deciphering the mythical mathematical code that underlies the Torah in order to meet the length of a feature film.  The absurdity of these sideshows further detracted from Max's credibility as a mathematician.<br /><br />Max, who was mentally unbalanced at the beginning of the film, descended into the chaos of his imagination and became self-destructive.  It is unclear how much of this was drug induced hallucination.  I would draw a parallel between him and a man who is obsessed with finding a god who is driven crazy by the unfulfilled expectation of actually finding one, thus he falsely claims success.  This story is much more about mental illness than mathematical or scientific theory and findings.  The injection of more credibility into Max at the onset of the film would have enabled the filmmakers to show a much more drastic decline in Max's condition.  Instead, he only went the short way from very nuts to completely nuts.  It might have some appeal to those who have an interest in psychiatry, but I suspect those who have such an interest would possess a scientific curiosity that this film will leave unsatisfied.<br /><br />I would have rated the film with one star, but I must admit I have seen a few that were worse.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game and now I got temple run 2 is out. You guys should make the temple run oz for the kindle fire. I can't wait for temple run 3 and hopefully temple run oz for the kindle fire.
B00509ODFO|5.0|Stargate series always take a bit of time to get into full gear. SGU was getting it right by the second season unlike Atlantis. The show is very good and it's so sad that it was pulled off.<br />There are no more spaceship in space shows. SGU characters were all strong and we all rooted Eli to find his potential.<br />I hope one day they will do a series cap or bring it back because it will rock!<br />BTW, mid 2014 will be 3 years.... who knows..
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was slow.  But it did have a good twist at the end and that was good.  If you can hang in there and stay with the characters, it is a good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game for passing time<br />And listening to music with as well,<br />Only wish is that they would add even more characters and boards
030758836X|4.0|Initially, I did get captivated by these characters. When the Bookclub I &#34;belonged&#34; to continually &#34;failed&#34; to communicate when we would next meet, I dropped from it and glad I did.  I enjoyed the detail of this book and couldn't wait for the outcome. Kindle is a great way to read any book I choose and I love my new freedom.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I needed to put the kindle down a few times, call or text my husband, and move on for a few days, then open the kindle back up, read, stop, etc.  Excellent writing.  It's enticing, erotic, mezmorizing, and peaceful.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|We felt like we were each of the characters. Great movie! These two actors always have the best chemistry on screen,
B005SE9W9I|4.0|The final season required more suspension of disbelief than usual, but still very entertaining. Still entertaining, worth the closure. thanks keifer.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|i really like this game, but thr glitches are a pain.  there is the tiny ball issue (read other bad reviews) .  The stuck chainsaw at the top.  It says you will get 5 free balls at the beginning of the round.  Sometime after about round 110 they stop.  I wish it worked better.  The arcade game is nerve wracking.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Thank you Warner Bros for this game. I hope you guys make the scribble nauts unlimited version. Keep up the amazing ideas.
B00BJO5SXK|4.0|I ordered this album after having already listened to it because I wanted to support Tyler instead of just downloading it. I wanted to get the deluxe edition to get all of the extras that came with the CD. When the album arrived, it did not have the clear plastic wrapping and the album looked like it had already been opened. The outer box looked bent and it didn't fit properly. All of the items were inside of the box, except for the Slater patch and I was really looking forward to that. I don't know how this could have happened because I ordered straight from Amazon. But overall, the album is great.
0694524441|3.0|When I put the fourth CD in to play it the chapter titles were repeated from the first CD.  I have never had that happen before.  Jeremy Irons has a good voice.  I did not connect to a couple of the character's voices, but it was acceptable.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Just what I was looking for in a Sci Fi show. It's close enough to reality that you want to believe.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|This Album is once again a piece of art from My Chemical Romance, i listen to it on almost a daily basis! Not as hardcore as their other stuff but still amazing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The whole series has been very enjoyable.  Lots of twists and turns with this family. The actors in this show are wonderful. They are just perfect for the person they are playing.  The story moves along at a good pace but you are excited waiting and wondering what's going to happen next.<br />Looking forward to season 4.
B009NNG202|4.0|There is this guy who has a nose unlike any other.  He is able to create scents and develop wonderful smells, all the while, he is obsessed with preserving scents (of people).  He gets caught, but by then he has developed this special scent that can control people so he gets away.<br /><br />Twisted and Stupid.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It's not the best game ever the first one is better. It's 90% boring Everyone I told to play it didn't like I didn't either.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|loved it a lot. a great read for many audiences. highly motivational and insightful. thanks arnold for a good read.

1574214276|5.0|bought this and &#34;totally tangled: zentangle and beyond.&#34; i didn't realize they had one of the same authors in common when i picked them out, but i was glad that i got them both. each one has designs that the other didn't.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a much more challenging game than your typical match-3. This requires planning and focus on getting the highest score within the time limit. I found the bonus rounds to be tougher and more enjoyable when I win.
B00846REIS|4.0|I'm too in love with Christian grey to love Gideon. :(  but I do like the book! Must say the sex in this was better than fifty
B0061PEAUY|4.0|It's a real page-turner!  She's a master at ending chapters in such suspense that you have to keep on reading! Looking forward to reading more books by the same author.
B000LB7G00|2.0|The mouse arrived in good shape, but it will not work with Blender. If you plan to by this for Blender, don't buy it. It was a waste of my time and money. All the controls were reversed. I tried all the options in the driver to reverse specific directions, or reverse all, but nothing worked. Apparently this did work around Blender 2.4 but the drivers have not been updated to work with the newer blender. I guess  the home boys that use Blender rather than the expensive  packages don't count. If you can afford the expensive software you can probably afford the higher end mouse also. High hopes dashed to pieces......
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|To slow. It sucked. Made Lincoln look like a bumbling fool who never looked people in the eye. I wish I could get my money back. Worst movie I have ever seen
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This was a fun app for finding networks. I wish it had the network connection code included. Not bad if you have the space.
141659521X|5.0|enjoy the books and read them when they coe out as enjoyable departures adn relaxation.  Keep it up a a
B00AB7HESI|4.0|A lot of complaints about this game state they &quot;cannot render&quot; or create items after typing in a word. My issue is the same on my Samsung Galaxy S3 but the reason it doesn't work is because I am not using the stock keyboard but instead use SwiftKey which doesn't have a button labeled &quot;enter&quot; but does have a &quot;return&quot; key. For whatever reason the return key doesn't work on some apps that I have used and we can add ScribbleNauts to that list. If I disable SwiftKey it works fine. I really don't know enough about how it all works together so I am not sure if it is an issue with the return key functionality in SwiftKey or if it is an issue with how the game is designed but if I had to but blame somewhere it would be on SwiftKey. I can't imagine that every developer would have to verify their game worked properly with every third party app that users could potentially install on every conceivable OS and hardware that's out today. Hopefully some of the users will troubleshoot the issues they are having before being quick to blame the game programmers.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|If you are a Whitney fan, you will love this CD! It is filled will all of her best music ever!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am thrilled to have this collection.  We sat down one day and had a Harry Potter marathon!!  Price was worth it.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|I'm not a reviewer, I'm a reader.  It took awhile for me to get into this story, but eventually I couldn't put it down.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|Poor quality, caused my phone to crash. Game controls are wonky and hard to use. I will be uninstalling this immediately.
1439102813|5.0|I wish every book were as enjoyable.  The characters are believable and the evolution of the them, and the story, are touching and remarkable.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|I wanted to own the complete set on bluray and caught it on special so the price could not be beat! However I was hoping for a little bit more from the triology on bluray since it is just a basic outside box and the 3 individual movies inside instead of having any bonus items. Still a great purchase
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Love the picture quality, and the progression of the story has gotten me interested. I'm still a newbie to the series, and I thought that the earlier 1.11 version was kinda dragging in the story development. The infusion of CGI and traditional mecha-anime animation look awesome in both versions. The concept is pretty cool, but it's still a typical Japanese anime that centers on teenage kids who have problems growing up. Overall, it's a great-looking series, and I can't wait for the third and final versions.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Must have for the Bond fans who have to own the series they love. Excellent film and the quality on bluray is impeccable
B00BVVA138|4.0|Worth the purchase. Sounds like Killswitch, which is what I wanted more of. All the songs are on the album are listenable.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you missed it in the theater this is a must own.... Classic Tarantino script and Jamie Foxx, Christopher Waltz, and Leo DiCaprio killed it in this film. I bought this version so I can have the bluray for home, the DVD for travel in the car/macbook and digital for everywhere else!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The My Little Pony game worked great and both my daughter's love it.<br />Unfortunately after the last update the game crashes during start (when the start progress bar reaches about 75%).

B00005JN8Z|5.0|They have done an outstanding job of restoring this film!  I have never seen it so clear.  I see detail I hadn't seen before.  Very well done!<br /><br />I grew up watching this 1951 film of Quo Vadis on a VHS and even as a child I was a fan of the music and couldn't get enough of it.  It was always one of my favorites and I may have had it on constant repeat.<br />I was excited when I was given this 2 DVD Edition of Quo Vadis for Christmas.  It will always be at the top of my list of favorite films.<br /><br />*Soundtrack INFO*:<br />Thanks to the Tadlow Music Compay - who re-recored Complete Quo Vadis Soundtrack/Score - has put it on a 2 Disc Album on a 2012 release.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a very interesting and intriguing app. I hated to put it down. Looking forward to the next.<br />It definitely kept my interest, so worth the 2 bucks.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|I have never owned a car that I had to stop and back up because the car wouldn't turn enough to go around a curve in the road. I could understand a sharp squared corner but not a curve. I had to at least mark one star to rate this game, but it certainly doesn't deserve it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It's hard not to be skeptical of Peter Jackson's decision to stretch the shortest of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth Books _The Hobbit_ into three movies when he was able to cover the entire _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy in the same number of films.  It should be obvious that the short novel is going to endure some padding if Jackson wants to stretch it across three movies entitled THE HOBBIT, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG and THERE AND BACK AGAIN.  How you feel about Jackson's depiction of Middle Earth will determine how much you like this movie.<br /><br />I have seen some critics complain that this movie drags.  I myself was delighted to see the characters never seen in the _The Hobbit_ but only referred to in the book.  (Possible Spoilers Ahead!). I rejoiced to see old friends at Rivendale like Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchette as Galadrial, and Christopher Lee as the future traitor Saruman the White.<br />Radaghast the Brown's debut presentation was curious but it was satisfying to see the Necromancer and the Witch King of Angmar at Don Gul Dur in a scene only hinted at in the novel.<br /><br />I believe that described it in a nutshell.  If you enjoy seeing scenes of the  fantastic come to life you will enjoy this padding and gobble it up like cotton candy and look forward to the next helping.  If all you care about is action and a race to the conclusion this movie might weigh on you like a plate of greasy corndogs and seem to drag.<br /><br />You can see from my five star review which camp I fall into.  I enjoyed _The Hobbit_ like a return trip to Disney World.  A few new attractions, but before too long it feels like I never left.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Killer.  Wonderful. Unique. Aesthetic. You like life and winning you'll love it.  Want  everything to die.  This is not your movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much and its so creative to use keys now. It's kinda like temple run but different. And I like that.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have always been a fan of scribblenauts and when I got it for my D's It was awesome. and now its even better on the kindle its soooo werth $0.99
B00124LYHQ|5.0|I am a high school English teacher.  I have taught this play off and on since 1993 to poor white kids in Western Massachusetts, to wealthy white kids in southern California, and to poor Mexican kids in a fairly large suburban city in Southern California.  I have never had a complaint.  They all were highly invested in the characters, never bored, would fight to read the parts of Blanche, Stanley, and Stella.  They have argued bitterly over the outcome regarding what would or should happen to all of the characters, who was right? who was wrong? They have universally loved the play.  It has always been a winner in the classes I taught.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this series and can't wait for Jan 2014. The characters are well developed and story lines are riveting.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Carefully use this game!  It is really addictive.  When I should be cooking dinner, I find my self cooking in the game instead.  Some instructions and explanations are sometimes difficult to figure out.  That is why not five stars.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very visceral and disturbing story. I could not put it down. One of the frustrations I had with this book is that I wanted to get the story from Jacob's point if view and also his mother's point of view not just the father's point of view.The whole angle of the murder gene was very interesting.
1433210428|5.0|Love it. Would recommend to others.<br /> Very thought provoking and provides basis for understanding logotherapy.<br />  Also gives insight to suffering at german concentration camps
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say about this game?  Challenging and fun. Love when it tells me no good move and I say \\"no way watch me\\". Sometimes it works- sometimes not. But when I get it right I feel like Rocky after climbing the stairs at the monument .(dramatic I know but hey it's my review)
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|What a prescient film. Now that bee colonies are dying off and we face famine, we can watch this and see it from the bee's point of view. :-)<br /><br />  Anyway, the deadpan timing on the jokes and the worker sarcasm are very well done. A fun watch.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Although technical, it was written so the everyman could understand it and enjoy  the story. I look forward to his other books.
B00015YVDG|4.0|I thought was a good movie. Not as good as Lethal Weapon series but worth watching. Worth the price to see it
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Didn't think I'd enjoy yet another life after armegeddon, Big Brother is watching SciFi movie but I'm glad I watched.  The characters are appealling and the plot compelling enough that the movie builds an empathetic relationship between you and the main characters.  Even if you're not a big fan of this genre, give it a try some day when you have nothing else to watch.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Oh yes.  There is graphic violence but the director mercifully doesn't dwell on it or overdo the gore.
B000B9VDME|4.0|DM has always pushed the envelope a bit. When you hear one of their songs on the radio there is no mistaken who it is.
B00916TU00|5.0|I've been following Olly since his appearance on the UK XFactor and I love him and everything he does. Right Place Right Time is just as good or even better than his last two albums. Olly can do no wrong
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft is the best game on my kindle fire.Creeprs and zombies and skeletons. Wow! I just love it I have to Karen love it. Just get it it's the best game on my kindle fire.
B008M36ER0|3.0|It had a descent story that you could follow. It was entertaining, had some action and I could watch it again.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|A great instruction manual to start conversations for people who are shy or generally have no idea about what to say in different social settings. There are plenty of examples of conversation starters in the book in addition to some Tips about body language.<br />I was a shy and introverted teen so this book could have saved me a lot had it come to me then.<br />Recommend this to people who want to make good first impressions and are not yet confident about themselves in social gatherings.<br />[...]
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I've heard mixed opinions about this song but I thought it was great.  Pharrell's vocals are great and really compliment the rhythm and melody.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Bought this for an older person to play and had fun using it myself. Gave it to them, and it's one of their favorite games also!
0792839730|4.0|This film is a sleeper with an exceptional cast.  It tells the story of the Allied invasion of Holland in their attempt to free the Dutch from Nazi occupation following D-Day.  Our interest in the film relates to the paratroopers, as we had a family member in the 437th Troop Carrier Group, which participated in the operation. If you're looking for a realistic portrayal of war rather than a &#34;sugar coated&#34; version of what World War II was all about see this film.
0385349947|5.0|This book explains how men and women see and react to different situtations differently.  Once women understand the things they are doing to hold themselves back, they can correct their course.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Just using it to play my Sansa MP3 in the car.  The sound quality is very good and there is no static or fading in/out, like my previous transmitter from a competitor.  The only problem I have seen is that, with the Transmitter plugged into my cigarette lighter, I get no reception on radio stations on the lower part of the FM band (93 MHz), and need to unplug the transmitter to listen to them.
1577312082|4.0|I don't buy absolutely everything Tolle says in the book, but there is lots of wisdom here.  Tolle is an interesting enlightenment master... he is aware and gentle, but with a Teutonic edge that can be amusing.
0375434526|3.0|There seemed to be an attempt to capture the energy and urgency of Angels and Demons but it kind of fell flat on me. I just didn't find it entirely believable though that's my personal opinion. With what happened later though it kind of made some sense with the government officials being videotaped during certain rites. They didn't want that kind of thing out in public. Didn't really find the 'noetic science' believable either. If you can manage to suspend your disbelief there actually is a good story line in this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't suspend my disbelief throughout most of it.
B001CTDH76|5.0|An excellent take on the modern detective vs the perceptive amateur. Most of the fun is guessing just how far Patrick Jane will go to prove that he is indeed &#34;The smartest man in every room&#34;.
B0095P31L6|5.0|My 4 year old & my 1 year old both really liked the movie.  The language was a little questionable, but otherwise a great movie.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Good selection of her songs.  Wasn't familiar with all of them, but enjoyed the new ones as well.<br /><br />Good value.
0756407125|5.0|I think this book is just one of the best books I have ever read. I loved the first one and this one holds amazingly to it.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|The story is amusing without relying on explicit sexual content to appeal to audiences.<br />A feel-good movie for a rainy day.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Easy to use, get the stations you have at home or across the globe. Talk or music. Free to use on my kindle fire when I have wi-fi connection.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all the books , just love the movie, can't wait til they bring out the next installment..love itttttttt!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Rather long and often difficult to understand.  A major undertaking by the studio that produced the film.  If you haven't already seen it live, it's worth the time.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I honestly bought this only because someone else reviewed a TV and mentioned using this for great PQ. So, I have only used it for this purpose and only for a limited time so far. This is some outright beautiful film being shown.  Rich with color and detail. The eye behind the camera definitely chose their shots well.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|You can't go wrong with the Borg, or with featuring Data, plus the story provides some much needed background information.  You have to put aside a few things.....the Borg can obviously be killed with swords or guns, yet the crew uses energy weapons?  Anyway, this movie delivered.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I don't get how this movie won so many awards.  It was a good movie but no way was it the best movie.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|The motion didnt bother me a bit. (Critics)......lmao!  I enjoyed it.  Colorful movie and characters.  I will watch it again.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I expected more from KB. I thought it really kept its distance and the most compelling part of the movie (by far) was the last half hour. And I do think it oversold the use and effectiveness of torture.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game ive played on the kindle yet it is way better than temple run 5 star
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Thought they did a great job staying true to the book as much as they could.  Rue's death was done in a good way.  Can't wait for the second book to be made into a movie!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I wanted to have the printer connected to my kindle so i could print from it like from my computer, but i cannot print from the web or my emails.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|Still showing ads even after purchasing to remove them. My kids love this game, just want the ads to go away.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|for a first novel this was a fantastic and brilliant read.  Loved the Irish country folk conversations. this had some very sad and heartwrenching chapters about the horrors of orphanages, however the heartwarming story was all the better for the difficult and very real experiences.  the humour throughout was a winner too. very clever very brilliant read. well done for a new author
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Well worth the 2. Could have been a bit longer though. Stil a lot of fun. I cant wait for the next one
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Makes getting on twitter much easier, and obviously it saves me time.  Always goes right to twitter and doesnr redirect me.  i like it
B005PK57NU|3.0|It was a gd show I'm just waiting for season four so I can decide the whole thing how many stars ill give it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app lets me choose how I want to design my pictures, and is very easy to use. It's fun and I use it all the time.  Definitely recommend to anyone...
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Miss Cass has outdone herself! She has entwined America's emotions about Maxon into a whirlwind of a book. At some points though, I became frustrated with the story but then it played out to the ending I wanted it to be.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Easy breezy tune which hopefully gives a good indication of the album to come.  Here's hoping the whole thing is good...
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Smart. Cerebral. Original. Great characters.  It doesn't feel done and redone like most shows with multiple seasons.  Look forward to each new episode.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|More than science fiction, what makes this a 5-star is the story line that allows characters to shine through... Memorable and likeable characters, who are motivated by passion and purpose (kinda like truth, justice, and the American way type of thing). Sad for the end of a saga that could have held my interest for another 500 pages!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this app is a lot of fun. it is very educational too you will learn a lot while having fun playing this game.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is fun, fast and when I'm going to lose, and I know it, I just start over again.  I love the look of the cards dealing and sets things up in a matter of a second or two.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|My daughter loved this movie as a child and now her son loved it. There is a few adult words but as long as he knew he couldn't say them everything was great. The whole family enjoyed this movie again & again.
1416955070|1.0|I can't put my finger on why I didn't like this book.  There are a few reasons that I can think of such as:<br /><br />Everything that Clary learns is also new to the reader.  It would have been better if the story was told from Jace's perspective and then he 'finds' Clary and they they go on an adventure together to find her mom.<br /><br />Simon's character reminded me of Ducky in Pretty in Pink.  Just some dumb character thrown in.  I originally thought this was going to be a little love triangle - oh, I was soooo wrong.<br /><br />Toward the end there was too much 'who done it' or who was telling the truth back and forth dialog - I just got bored with it.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />Did the author HAVE to make Jace and Clary brother/sister ... what a weird situation to throw into what could have been an exciting novel.  And .. the author when 'there' .. she has the characters practically 'fall' for each other .. I found this quite a disappointing direction to take the story.<br /><br />Really not interested in reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />M.
B00683JLXA|1.0|I downloaded this game and i'm glad it was free. The games mechanics are messed up and its hard to get the panda to throw the stone, you need to tap his front and move your finger to his back to have any chance to throw things. I've uninstalled it and i really wish i could give it no stars. I'd advise anyone thinking of getting this game to avoid it - its a badly made angry birds clone.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|This was my Easter gift to grandchildren & nieces & nephews this year.  Instead of more candy, 4 households received the gift of entertainment that all the little ones & some of the parents enjoyed!  For the price, it was more affordable than candy!
B00BA5H3TU|5.0|I had no idea who Riverside was about a month ago.  But a friend at a Blackfield concert a few years back recommended that I give them a try.  I finally got around to listening to Anno Domini (the album before Shrine) and thought it was very cool.  Modern prog rock with a slight edginess.  Slowly got addicted to the album.<br /><br />Then Shrine came out and I thought they had won another listen with me...let's check out one more album.  WOW!  The opening is awesome.  The follow-up song is cool.....and before I knew it, I was at the end of the album, laughing to myself thinking...how in the world is this band not more well-known?  This album is freakin fantastic!  I love how it has power behind it, but with really catchy melodies throughout, and not one minute of boredom, or one chorus repeat too many, etc.  I spun back around to track #1, and have now run through it a half-dozen times, and will now be going back in their catalog.<br /><br />Hey, you Riverside boys, you have a new fan.  I hope your touring soon becomes more extensive so that the U.S. can enjoy you live.<br /><br />Anyone that like modern prog rock...bands like Porcupine Tree, Marillion, Spocks Beard, Pineapple Thief...you are gonna love this album.<br /><br />Rob<br /><br />Rob
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben is bang up with this movie. I loved loved loved this movie. One of my favorites of all times. 5 stars....
B007EDYN36|4.0|extreamly honest  and touching, goes into alot more  about the behind the scene's  in the bad, makes paul and gene look like jerks which is really sad
B004XNGKBS|4.0|When I export my note to pdf, it came out a very long single page instead of a number of A4 size (for example) pages which would be easier to print. Freenotes has such function. Can you fix that shortcoming? Except that, Handrite is perfect app. Best userfriendliness!
0896898288|5.0|A great way to celebrate our past generations by making a quilt representing their favorite blocks & colors.  A necessary book for any library.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had me going I tell u I read all day!!! I loved it... well on to the 2nd half lol
1476734941|5.0|I first heard about this on PBS when Dr. Michael Mosely was featured in a program.  After giving birth to my twins at age 45, nothing that I tried was working to lose the baby weight and get back into shape, although I am one of those people who has struggled with my weight throughout my life.  I was obese and the boys were 3. I thought the program at first sounded way too hard, but after purchasing the book, I found out that this is the ONLY nutrition program that I have EVER been able to stick to and not make my family suffer through with me. My husband cooks and can't really cook light.  I LOVE to eat and drink wine a few times a week.  With this program,  I just eat 500 cal 2 days a week on nonconsecutive days.  I eat normally on the other days (but I don't pig out, but I do have my wine!), I work out at Curves 4x a week and walk the other days.  This workout program is helping to keep my skin from sagging as my weight comes off (I know, \\"yuck\\" but it's the reality for somebody like me who has a lot of weight to lose).  It is coming off at about 2 pounds a week. After I reach my goal weight, I will just eat 500 cal one 1 day a week instead of 2. And of course I will always have to workout regularly.  It is so much easier than it sounds. There are also many health benefits to this type of eating all listed in the book.  This is certainly not for everyone and anyone who is thinking of it should consult a dr, but I was healthy, not nursing, 48 and desperate to get healthy for my twin boys who were growing fast and starting to be able to outrun me. It is really working for me.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Never heard of this title when it debuted.  Absolutely entertaining.  I am a tough critic on films, and this one was good enough to warrant a second viewing for me.  Very well done.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game gives you plenty of challenges and hours of fun.  Graphics are so clear you have playing the seek and find games.  I could go on and on.  Buy it's great
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|OMG i luv this game i play it when i get a chance i play it.But there's 1 thing i HATE.  You have to wait for it to download. As in when you open it up, it has to download 53.07 mega bytes. Other than that, it is a AWESOME game!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I'll make this short.  I very much enjoyed both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I was so bored with Mockingjay, I couldn't wait to finally get to the end.  This book really came up short.  It was such a disappointment!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Heartfelt account of a family's experience with tragedy.  Excellent acting on all accounts.  Children were phenomenal as well as Naomi and Ewan.  highly recommend.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I don't have a lot of games for myself, most are for my kids.  But this is a good way to work your brain to keep in sharp.  And your vision too.  I would recommend this game.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it is not as much about hiking as it is about finding inner peace and strength.  Very good read, witty and funny, it will have you hooked.
B008ODZNLG|4.0|Very interesting and insightful look into a rare craft.  The scene with the hundreds of tuna carcasses in the fish market warehouse was disturbing.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Cleverly written, entertaining, and it kept me coming back.  New take on an old classic, and it's beyond enjoyable. Sherlock's character is so well played, and the new take on Watson is a modern-day possibility.  All of it creates such an interesting show.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Fun game. Pretty addicting. Tough to get good cards though. Also, during matchmaking games sometimes gets stuck &quot;syncing&quot; to other players. Other than that, definitely a good game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters, plot and storyline are all so well done. I am an avid lover if period pieces and no one does them quite like the English!
B00A6CT012|5.0|I have followed the blog closely and really enjoyed the book as well. Interesting material, nice personal anecdotes, easy to read and inspiring.  I look forward to more from Bea!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is terrific television. We should always champion shows with female leads, particularly when their character can operate independently of men. It takes forward-thinking producers and writers to put forth such a character, much like Mary McCormick's character on In Plain Sight or Emily Deschanel's, Dr. Brennan. These truly successful, brilliant, and high-functioning women, like Alicia, are worthy of our time.  Now we just need to see more POC. This much more accurately represents the women I know, grew up with and work with. This one is worth watching and sharing. Bravo!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Very unique &#34;western&#34; if you want to call it that.  Entertaining. Kind of kept me guessing.  Somewhat about vigilantes. Good ending.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This game was fun for the most part.  My son only played it for a few minutes, but like it.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Riveting crime drama with a fresh take on investigation, I especially loved the fact that the usual film formulas and relation were not followed in the movie.
B000FCJZ4K|3.0|The author claims he does not schmooze famous/rich people in order to get some of what they have to rub off onto him.  I feel that is exactly what he is doing.  On the positive side he is also advocating schmoozing all people he come into contact with.  I have a hard time reading about how he met so and so and took such and such to lunch.  But the fact that he uses those contacts to his advantage may be helpful If handled properly.  The key is 1) not to use people til they are tired of you and 2) consider the value of those that may not fall into the &#34;ritzy&#34; catagory.  It reminds me of a song I learned many years ago in Girl Scouts, &#34;Make new friends, but keep the old.  One is silver and the other gold.&#34;  To sum it up, I would not have read this book unless it was required for a college class but find there are a few gems buried inside.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|angery birds Rio is a really fun app and Rio is also my favorite movie but its hard to get the birds out of the cages and its really chalanging that's what makes it fun
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have followed this series since the beginning and am happy I have finally competed it but at the same time sad that there will be no more.  An excellent ending. The Wheel turns, ages come to pass.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|1st World war - up there with the book Birdsong.  Good read, makes you want to read the next novel which is even better!
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|OK - it's easy to tell the pirate village was built inside a studio - but you don't care. The basic story may be simple - but you still don't care. Steven Spielberg weaves eye candy better than anyone. Just sit back and enjoy.
1423140591|5.0|I needed to replace this book from my library and it is a great book. The school kids love reading it.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|OK - it's dated. The story is a rip off of something else. The sets are primitive - it is not action packed like movies of today - but I still love this movie. Everyone from Lost in Space to Star Trek, and everything one else has borrowed from this film. The first serious SciFi Movie, and it was done very well.
B0089BSM70|5.0|Very Nice follow up to the 1978 Classic.  More of the night HE came home. A must see for any Halloween fan.
0843178078|5.0|My 3 yrd old grandson loves these books.  He has the entire set that his father had as a child except he was missing 2 books from the set.  We were thrilled to find  you could get the missing ones.  He couldn't wait to get Mr Chatter Box.  He loves all the books from the Mr Men series.
B0081336FO|5.0|Entertaining to watch; this is skilled cast and with all the fun and intrique that is uniquely BBC. A refreshing change; wishing there was more to see.
0500543933|4.0|Great book which gives you a complete overview in modern street photography from around the world. I even discovered a couple of photographers i did not know about and one has become my 'hero' (Daido Moriyama)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought it filled in a bunch of blanks, he could have filled in more. Somebody build a fire under Martin and lets get the next one published,<br />Hey HBO is about to catch up with him! And then what will they do with the series!?
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|The conrols of this app are not intutive, and the screen isn't responsive to touch (Kindle Fire).  The app is NOT like a driving simulator, which would have been useful.  When tilting the Kindle Fire to move the car, it did not react as expected. But the most annoying thing is that written instructions, which would help users learn how to play, aren't provided.  I have a lot of gaming experience, but this game was just downright frustrating. And figuring out how to make unresponsive apps work isn't my idea of fun.  Challenging is one thing, but this app is a car wreck.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I thought this was a quick read and interesting book based on actual research.  I have been doing the fast diet now for four weeks and have lost 10 lbs. This is after I had hit a 'plateau' on a popular diet plan. So far I am really liking it. Like he says in the book, you can do anything for one day especially knowing you are not deprived on the other days. I also like the health benefits involved with fasting besides the weight loss. Worth checking out!
B003O86FMW|5.0|beary good book and really enjoyed reading it excited for the movie to come out in nov. 2013...okey dokey....have  a nice day...
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Parking challenge 3d is an okay game where you guide your cars through a obstacle course (maze) trying not to hit the walls, you get 3 hits before you have to restart. Overall I think the game is okay it would be much better with a better interface for controlling your vehicle.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Graphics are good<br />Sound effects are pretty good.<br />Only has one permission and its not an overly scary one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The controls feel unnatural.<br />After a few levels the game is unrealistic difficult do to the bad controls<br /><br />This game is fairly fun but do to the unrealisticly bad controls. I find it very frustrating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book and liked the movie as well ....enjoyed reading....have a beary great day okey dokey and good bye

B007V4530A|5.0|Very helpful to get you to think beyond the obvious. Will be helpful to all presenters regardless if a Ted talk is the objective.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|i think it's great! it has up to date news, and celebrity gossip stuff...which I love. whats not to like about it
B002Z58GQS|5.0|I really like this item, with it's large capacity and how easy it is to use. 1  thing to keep in mind is the little cover cap, already lost mine thanks to our cat.
B009EJSQ3G|5.0|It's so nice to finally get some TV appearances on DVD. Though I'm not a fan of the constant remastering of the ABBA collections these new Deluxe Editions do have some nice features. The only thing missing from this are the original videos but you can get them other places this has TV show performances which is always nice to see because Frida can never seem to get the lip synch right! If you are an avid fan like myself you need this in your collection!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I downloaded this book not expecting any thing more than light reading. However, I was quite surprised with both plot, writing style and conveyance of dialogue. The characters emotion and the scenes came across quite well.  Two thumbs up from this reader.
B003IB38UM|5.0|This is ABBA's Disco album for sure and also the sessions with the most unreleased/unfinished songs. Would've been nice to get a full version of Just A Notion or a clean copy of Under My Sun/Rubber Ball Man mixed like they did with Like An Angel on the Visitors Deluxe Edition. Still we did get a nice clean copy of the unfinished version of If It Wasn't For The Nights with no strings and no high harmony vocals. This is a must for any ABBA fan for the DVD alone! The sound quality is great and you can finally hear Agnetha's backing vocals on Angeleyes! They really pop with this remastering.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie, and all the extras make it worth $5!!!!!!! I highly recommend buying this movie. -Arnold
B0083O0ZHS|5.0|We finally get a peek into the minds of Benny & Bjorn with the unreleased versions of Like An Angel Passing Through My Room. I've read on various ABBA sites that they weren't happy with it and tried it out in various ways and it was finally all mixed together and added on this final Deluxe Edition of the ABBA catalogue. It's nice to hear I Am The City all cleaned up and You Owe Me One was added back on after it was removed from the last remastered set.
B0091WRFCO|5.0|Watch it on the kindle with my son in HD great movie. I would recommend renting or buying this movie
B004R2HGMC|5.0|Finally a remastered mix of On And On And On Video with the extra verse! There are some nice TV performances and the sound quality really amazed me. This is the album that really got me hooked on ABBA so for me it will always be one of their greatest.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I like it for the ease of use and the meme generator. Great tool that includes several commonly used features that otherwise require several different apps.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|A must see for anyone approaching 40. A very funny look at a middle aged family! Not for kids but great to watch with your significant other.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is so Mich fun I am addicted to it. I recommend that you get this game now NOW!!
B0084BMUFA|3.0|Anything by Charles Dickens is a good read, although difficult at times. We do not read enough of the classics these days.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Fast delivery and it was exactly what I needed and  the price was right and it was  like I expected it to be just like it was described, I would recommend it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Second season is alright compared to the first which is brilliant. The entire series are characters and acting is amazing overall!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Season 8 has been great, I will be sad when the show ends. I like every character on the show.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of the first games I played on a touch screen and i just purchased it again. It's great, from start to finish. Even after its done, cutest surprise!
B009G8GRX6|3.0|This is an extremely disappointing album in every way imaginable. Muse try, but fail miserably, to experiment with electronic music (some lite dubsteppy noise, some electric-funk, and some other electricy gimmicks that don't work). The lyrics are trite, lazy, and very poppy in their lowest-common-denominator simplicity. I hoped desperately that the song commissioned for the London Olympics (Survivor) would not make an appearance and also wasn't an indication of what was to come but sadly both were true. Somehow this album ends up feeling conceited and self-indulgent in that these songs are what someone thought were worth someones money and what the fans who had made Muse the success they are actually wanted. Judging by the mostly positive reviews, it doesn't seem that was entirely off, so I'm afraid this may be what Muse is now.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|If anyone was ever curious what it was like aboard a German U boat during World War II, this is definitely the movie to see.
B0089AF2DS|4.0|In most ways, any new music from Baroness is good music and there's nothing inherently wrong with Yellow & Green (Y&G). However, when the albums first came out I wasn't blown away by them in the same way I had been the first times listening to Red and to Blue. Some of the songs on Y&G seem more melodic and accessible than either previous release, but also less layered and deep. I don't think that opinion has changed in the months since they came out, but I think I've learned to appreciate them on their own merits and I find myself listening to the albums repeatedly. Y&G might be an easy entry point into Baroness' music, and once you find yourself wanting more the Blue and Red albums will really heighten the Baroness experience.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great story with compassion and warmth, and grabs your heart and squeezes.<br />Nicholas Sparks keep up the great work - you definitely know how to make a girl cry!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The movie was good but there were scenes that had no relation to the story that made it seem ridiculous, like the the fighting stones.
B0046B1KHG|3.0|The movie was good, but the video streaming was terrible. I watched the movie two time and each time the streaming stop 3 times and I had to start over again. If they don't get the streaming problems fixed, I will not buy anymore movies, and I might even demand some refunds, for failure to supply good service.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|It just didn't make any sense. If you like easy, nonsense stories, this one is for you! Not my idea of a good read.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app has my entire family (adult children, their spouses, and my grandchildren) amazed at how many times the solution is found just by asking questions.  We have tried real people, carton characters, and others and can not stump the akinator.
B003F7Y0VU|4.0|my 10 yr old loved it and i enjoyed it too. i would recommend to kids and adults both.  Fun
B005DJREJS|5.0|I stumbled upon this show from my Amazn Rime video. I'm intrigued by this show, even at 36. I would've never known about because I do not watch MTV, where it airs. I'm now using my DVR to watch season 3. Thanks Amazon for having this show. Matty Mcibbin is so cute!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|If you approach this book as a light read, you won't be disappointed. The subject matter is based on fact and there is a happy ending. I have recommended this book to friends. It is horrifying, funny, sad and touching.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great title for an even greater book.  I couldn't put it down and I could relate to the author as my life has many similar aspects to his.  Loved reading it and would recommend it for anyone interested in inspirational reading whether you're an athlete or not.  It gave me some good insight into training for distance running.  It also gave me some excellent insight for plant based nutrition even though I'm a carnivore and as a weightlifter I have a vastly different outlook on nutritional intake. However after reading the entire book, I will take it all to heart and see what I can use.  Even though I mostly weight and strength train, I like to explore what everyone else in the athletic world is doing to glean insight and recommendations that can prove useful to my own endeavors.  Love the book and would buy it all over again in hindsight.  I was disappointed when I came to the end of the book since I wanted to keep reading.  Even though there is a lot in the book, I wished there were 10 more chapters!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Kept my attention. Got all the facts without bogging you down. The actors did their job well. Would recommend this movie to everyone.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a memoir of a young boy, Ishmael, who describes the terrors that haunt his daily life in Sierra Leone while being a child soldier. When Ishmael's village is attacked by the rebels he is separated from his family and begins a new, and scary, chapter of his life. Ishmael describes that safety is not an option, death is everywhere, and child soldiers fight for both the rebels and the army. This painfully true story describes the horrors that citizens live through in a way that the reader can almost life through what is really happening in this war-infested part of the world. Ishmael leads the reader through the first rebel attack that he experienced, to the search for safety and his family, and all the way through the end of his time as a child solider. While the events of the book are heartbreakingly tragic, it is also enlightening and a rare window into what the war victims really suffer through. This captivating story will surely draw you in and make the war more real than you could ever imagine.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I have really enjoyed this CD.  She does different types of music on it and I like more than half of the recordings, I am  generally only crazy about 2 or 3 out of  an assortment.  I think the price is more than reasonable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is very easy to use, good for all ages, and in conclusion is an amazing game. it has great graphics too.
0525478817|5.0|This book was everything a book should be and more! I highly recommend it to men and women alike. It honestly blew me away to say the least.
B004GYY714|3.0|Nice to get local stations. Would like to pull in songs and make a play list, not just star songs as they happen to play.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed this movie! Violence e is subtle. Bad language minimal. Unlikely love story that ends without finality. Hope HG II is soon.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|THis album is ok.  It is definately different from thier usual sound. I  would have to say its so/so. Overall its ok.
1885167776|1.0|What a scam. Most of the March reviews are fake.  If you click on a reviewer and visit their other reviews you will find that this book is the only one they've reviewed.  Desperate and shameful.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is so great. I'm already on level 11 and I've bet I gained over 1,000 coins all together. This game is amazingly fun and awesome. This is pure awesomeness!!!
B00683JLXA|5.0|These type of games were out WAY before angry birds. I understand why people compare these games to angry birds, but to call them angry bird clones is idiotic, as angry birds is a clone itself.  They just happened to be in the right place at the right time to become a big hit in the tablet / smart phone area.<br /><br /> This is a good game and works good on kindle fire HD 8.9
1476733953|5.0|I had never heard of this book (or author) but I saw a recommendation on Face Book for it and it looked very appealing.  I got it for my Kindle and have only stopped reading it when other duties (i.e., interruptions) occurred.<br /><br />I just finished it with a sigh of disappointment - but only because I had finished it.  Luckily, I then saw The Shift Omnibus, ordered it and can start another book journey.<br /><br />Its an awesome book populated by people I felt I knew personally.  What an exciting TV mini series or 3 part film it would make.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love this game but when I went back to my home ( kindle fire) and then back to the game, and I had to start at level one reef shark (1st shark) when all I had to do was save for the 3rd shark.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I haven't been this happy with a Boz Scaggs release since 'Silk Degrees'.  Superbly produced and very well played.  Top shelf.
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|Being a long time fan of Mr Tarantino I was very disappointed with this movie.  The is the worst movie of his I have seen.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This key is what I needed to activate my full version Doc To Go app. Perfect and works on other Android devices.
0345803485|1.0|The problem with this book is that there's only so much hard core porn a person can read before it becomes dull. For a book like this to work, it needs a solid backstory, & frankly it is completely lacking in this regard. There's really nothing compelling the reader to turn the page. At least with books like the twilight series you had some suspense & action backing up the endless pages of gushing romance. Not that twilight is an example of great fiction, but it was at least moderately entertaining. 50 shades simply bores the reader, which is an astonishing feat considering how unrestrained it is erotically.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have this app on my Android device and works fine. So I decided to add this for my Kindle.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The story and characters kept me turning the page but her knowledge of the south and customs felt very flat to me. She had these great characters but the author didn't seem to know what to do with them. She certainly was by no means able to make them believable! She may have done her research on Virginia but did not bother to research &#34;southern soul&#34; which is what this bool lacks. After reading the authors notes it was clear to me why....she is from Canada. Some understandings come from years of immersion. She certainly has not &#34;gotten it&#34; yet.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I recommend this app for those that need adobe to read documents. I have this app on all of my devices.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|If you like Kate Morton you will not be disappointed! She certainly has a style all her own and in the Forgotten Garden she does not let her readers down. Beautifully written! Her ability to weave a tale is just awe inspiring!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Anyone with a reader, tablet, smartphone must have this app loaded on their devices. I would recommend this app to anyone with a Facebook account.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|WOW!!! The author has a unique ability to take morose subject matter and make it bitter sweet, funny, and hopeful. I thought I would hate this book! Thought it would be far too sad to stomach. I could not have been more wrong. While I did cry for a good 10 minutes after the ending, they were tears of hope with a renewed respect for the human spirit. LOVED this book. So incredible well written.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I only ordered this book to see what the hype was all about.  I read it just to say I had finished it but honestly it did nothing for me.  I was more annoyed with the main character's naivety than anything.  It was well-written but the story itself really did not make me want to read the next two books in the series (and I don't plan to).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is this BEST GAME ever you should get it and it's free it's EPIC I love it if you don't the u crayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyye
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I haven't purchased the trilogy yet, I was investigating the versions. I read the one review that helps to clarify which boxed set contains the original release versus the special edition. I still wasn't absolutely sure which one to get though so I went digging around and I found this comparison chart on Amazon that I thought might be helpful to others, so posting it here. I didn't want to bring down the rating of this boxed set so I gave it 5 stars just so I could post this. Hope it's helpful to anyone else who isn't quite sure which set to get.<br /><br />Go to this link for the blu-ray version then scroll down to find the comparison chart:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Complete-Episodes-Blu-ray/dp/B003ZSJ212/ref=pd_cp_mov_1
B0026772N8|2.0|Someone receommended this to me, so I ordered it out of curiosity.  It reads like a journal, just not what I'm interested in reading.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I like the case because it is very handy.  The only problem is the Kindle turns on when the case is opened, so it should turn itself off when it is closed.  So, when my grandson uses it the battery runs down because he thinks it will turn itself off.

0345803485|2.0|Okay, I am going to make this review brief and painful. 50 Shades of Grey was a huge dissapointment. SERIOUSLY! This trilogy is #1 on most of the book lists and I cannot figure out why. E.J. James' writing is atrocious. Ana and Christian did far too much \\"gasping\\" OUT of the bedroom and for someone who agreed to go along with the kinkiness that takes place in the \\"Red Room of Pain,\\" Ana sure flushed \\"scarlet\\" a lot at even the smallest things that would normally not even make a nun turn red. Don't even get me started on Ana's Inner Goddess and it's counter part, her subconscious. Really? Did she really have to refer to these parts of her mind so much?<br /><br />Christian's only redeemable quality was the fact that he was abused as a child. Harsh, I know, but it is truth. He is in his late twenties but spoke as if he's lived 100+ years. Before you all start thinking I am only bagging on 50 Shades of Grey because of the highly erotic and demented sex scenes, you've got me all wrong. While I do not prefer erotica, I've read novels that border on the edge of the genre. For example, Vishous is one of my favorite brothers from Black Dagger Brotherhood. His childhood was horrific and he, like Christian, likes the whole BDSM scene. The difference between the two men? One is well written and freaking awesome, while the other is a domineering psycho who is about as interesting as a wet paper bag filled with \\"foils.\\"<br /><br />Ana was not believable as a 22-year-old college graduate who has never felt any amount of extreme like or love for another man until she meets, oh-so-handsome, Christian Grey. \\"Oh My!\\" (Another fraze that Ana thought entirely too much). It made me wish Christian would just go ahead and choke her until she lost consciousness, making it impossible for her to think such ridiculous thoughts. So, what type of virgin meets someone who shows her this crazy room adorned with whips, chains, and gags and doesn't run screaming bloody murder? I mean, maybe one that didn't gasp at every smoldering look and sexual innuendo, surely, but innocent Ana didn't even flinch, did she?<br /><br />I read a little more than half of this book hoping for something to jump out and grab me like it did the rest of the world, but it truly never happened. I decided to skim through the rest and then I read the last ten pages, which proved to be better than the entire book put together. So, this is more of a 2.5 star rating for me. I'll be reading the last 15-20 pages of the next two books in the trilogy just to see if Christian ends up being honest with Ana about his childhood and calms down on his brutal needs. Also, I am hoping E.J. James improves on her writing skills and is able to live up to the glory that has been bestowed upon her.<br /><br />It is disconcerting that this author has been placed in a category among great authors due to the high amount of sales this trilogy has brought in.t didn't gasp at every smoldering look and sexual innuendo, surely, but innocent Ana didn't even flinch, did she?<br /><br />I read a little more than half of this book hoping for something to jump out and grab me like it did the rest of the world, but it truly never happened.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I would not even bother with this worth less app.sucks sucks sucks sucks like I said it really not with it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Enjoyable reading.  I found the situations and politics entirely feasible and believable.  I think this would make a great movie.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|this movie is a movie that  be beat it is the movie of all time they  knew how to make movies with this one thanks
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|If you want to hear raw emotional spine-chilling lay-your-bare-soul down blues-spontaneous improvisional jazz fusion that rewrote the rules bridging musical genres- this collection is the ultimate for duane allman fans- the man made his mark with the old blues masters- with the soul singers of the 50's and 60's- its all here - and when you hear that signature sound and tone of duane's guitar- no matter which track- you know he played on a different level and was not afraid to take that risk to make that song sound better- as young as he died- he left behind a huge catalog of his music that you will find influenced a whole generation of listeners and musicians-  buy it now--- they only made ten thousand - i have #914 and im blasting my bose right now<br />gavito
0783240236|5.0|this is the best movie ever made just loved it  and cant wait to watch is again and again great price also
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome, but does sometimes skip. Other than that it is amazing!! It makes me feel like I actually have horses!!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|i love Steven King and this one of the best story's ever made thanks for the great price LOVE IT
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could not put it down. I was sorry when I finished it. I thoroughly enjoyed the read. It held me the whole time
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful story, never a dull moment. My grandfather was a B-17 pilot who never talked about the war in the air, and this really brings it into prospective.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|the bad:Terrible controls to work around the game. The good: the game is easy enough so you don't need instructions which I hate. But how good can something be when the first steps are so hard you just get discouraged. Remember guys, this is a phone not a console.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, but of course being a Clutch fan I was going to buy it regardless.  I am no music reviewer, but let me say that on first listen I was blown away at how great this album was.  Short, rockin, catchy tracks.  I listen to it all the time. Clutch still rules...
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I found this series after the fact but really wish they would've continued it. Kept me engrossed like Downton Abbey.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I think this is a great game to play. It's allot of fun. I really love it. It isn't one of those bloody games that all you do is killing and splash blood everywhere.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|The movie was okay.....it was realistic, beautiful scenery and easy to follow along with on the journey. I just had a hard time streaming the movie for some reason.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|One of the best.  Our kind of movie.  Easy to download.  Played well through our Roku player.  One of the better roles for Dinero.
B00358ESI4|3.0|The movie was okay......I enjoyed watching it, I think it has an excessive amount of profanity in it. The same point could have been made without all the profanity.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I have seen this movie many times, but I had to own it... A wonderful movie about life! Glad I bought it!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love this book.... but must read the first tho.... gonna get the next. I m ask already in love with all the characters
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I like this game.  there are so mane coins.  Like....  So Many..  Very adicting. I Love it. wonderful job. COINS!
B0000DIXDR|4.0|This is a fun movie that calls to most of us every now and again. A good addition to the library.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved it. Percy Jackson is a must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels, and adventure.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Part three if the Hunger Games trilogy was as well written as the first two books. A wonderful read which brought tears to my eyes near the end.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Hook is a favorite in our family. We were very pleased to be able to watch this on Amazon with Prime.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Graphics are great game is fun to play. Keeps my wife occupied and off my case. The price is perfect.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|A great follow up to Sigh No More.  My favorite tracks are Babel, I Will Wait, Holland Road, Lover of the Light, Hopeless Wanderer, & Broken Crown.  So, I think its definitely worth getting the whole album.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a great movie.  I have watched it so many times.  It really tells the truth about how the &#34;help&#34; were treated and that was so wrong.  However, the cast help make it have a lot of funny scenes, as well as serious.  GREAT MOVIE.
0060254920|5.0|This was my son's favorite book. Now it will be my grandson's favorite also.  It will be a family tradition.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love this movie.  Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors and along with the other great cast it makes a great movie.  It's serious at times but mainly funny.  LOVE IT&#62;
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read this book in a couple of days while on a trip.  I couldn't put it down.  I have not seen the movie yet, but am interested in seeing how it compares to the book.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|The idea for this game is great but the execution leaves much to be desired.  As others have said, there is no tutorial and while the controls are more or less intuitive they don't work that well.  In a real car I always know which way is right but half the time with this game if the car goes around a corner I seem to lose track and can only figure it's because my brain sees it more as up and down rather than right or left.  If I could turn the kindle around so I maintained the orientation the way I am in a car it would help.  Also, the speed control is difficult, the car doesn't maintain speed so it needs constant tweaking which is just one more thing to do as it is but it also would work better if they were labeled instead of just marked with arrows.  I will probably keep it for now but I wouldn't be happy with this if I had paid for it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|After seeing the movie, I was frustrated at the storyline and bought the book.  The book is very different, but managed to answer the 'whys' that the movie didn't cover.  A very good book.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoyed the second book of the series.  But, it wasn't long enough!  Thank you Kiera for the story, I anxiously await the next book in this series.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My 4 yr old grandson is a Spider-Man lover and thinks this game is awesome.  I love it too as it keeps him entertained and learning at same time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was surprising because the title didn't match the book. I think it should have been 50 Shades Lighter ... but I guess that wouldn't have sold as many books.
B000P407K4|3.0|An amusing movie, but a little dull at times. Kubrick fans will want to see it but I think watching it once was enough.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|I won't give a full blown review, but for anyone who is curious about life in the GDR through an amazing set of characters, this is an amazing movie.<br />Had to watch it for my Global Studies course, and couldn't resist watching it again a few days after.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I have loved the Doctor Who program since I was introduced to the series in the 70's. Tom Baker will always be my favorite Doctor; but, when the program returned with Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper, I fell in love with the series all over again. I've collected episodes from the William Hartnel pilot and all of the following Doctors up to Tom Baker. This complete &#34;first series&#34; is the beginning of my collecting all of the episodes including those featuring David Tenant and Matt Smith. Thanks you for making them available.
B002QHH22O|5.0|Funny band .... that can really PLAY ! .... You have to have a good sense of humor to enjoy this album .... STEEL PANTHER Rocks .... Buy this .... and if you like Melodic Hardrock bands like Dokken , TNT , Queensryche ..... Check out the band MAGNITUDE 9 here on AMAZON MP3
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I really like this game. I wish it had more levels on the arcade level, but it is fun to play the different versions.
B005XI91FY|5.0|STEEL PANTHER ROCKS ... Great album .... You have to have a sense of humor  .... but they can also play very well .... Check this out ! .... Also if you like melodic hard rock ,  Buy the albums from the band MAGNITUDE 9 here on Amazon MP3
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Haven't watched a tv series that I have enjoyed this much in a very long time. The characters are fascinating and believable, as well. Always looking forward to the next episode with its many twists and turns. Love it!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|EVEN THOUGH I GOT MY DVDS FROM DIFFERENT SELLERS, I WAS PLEASED THAT THEY ALL ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IN GREAT CONDITION. MY GRAND KIDS WERE SO HAPPY, THEY HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS SET FOREVER. SO GLAD TO HAVE FOUND THEM AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.THANKS
B00B2DSK06|5.0|This is such a cute movie.  My four year old son loves it, and I enjoy watch it as well.  The animation is impressive for the 8-bit characters, and the voice acting is great.  A cute lesson to be learned as usual, but it's not shoved down your throat, and my son got it too.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|We watch it on HBO and we are in gangster era in 20's and 30's.  We are going to continue to purchase Season 2 and 3 so we will be up to date with the latest season when it comes on.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|Even though its the only Disney movie I can think of where the female character is raised by BOTH her parents, it's a good movie. Animation is what we expect from a Disney film, and the lesson is a good one.
B00296A4F4|4.0|I watch this show when I am on the treadmill and it makes my exersise go alot faster.  I like it!
B00AIBZJS4|3.0|While most of the action was standard (and amazing) Cirque Du Soleil stunts and stretches and bodies bending in ways opposite from normal, the latter part of the disc, excerpts from KA and the Beatles and the Elvis shows, were tedious and not very interesting.  These portions got a little too weird, even from the normally weird underlying themes of the C du S shows.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This story starts off a bit disjointed, but quickly evolves into something difficult to put down.  There's definitely a theme evolving with much of Sanderson's writings; along the lines of Elantris, Stormlight, and now the Emperors Soul.  Each treads close in terms of the magic system, but all are unique stories.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|It's a very interesting and very good book - - not great, but very good and very provocative.  I have already recommended it to others - especially educators, who need to know this.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is worth the money. Obviously not as in depth as the PC version but its still a very good game. My one complaint would be that bluetooth keyboard and mouse are not supported yet.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very thorough and consistently changes with the wierd weather in my area. Overall easy to use as well.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I love hangman and this is app fun with the animated graphics.  Works well too. I recommed this hangman app.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I chose this game because of the fact that it is a hidden object those are my favorite to play. the only thing I hate about this game is the time runs out to fast.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this trilogy so much! Didn't think I was gonna like it because of the nature of it but I so fell in love with these characters!
B00821OX98|5.0|A great series that moves right along.  Each show deals with different issues but they complement whats happened before and what will happen tomorrow.  The chacters are well played by a great cast.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book opened my eyes and confirmed for me my existence on this earth. I recommend this to anyone seeking the truth of our being. Get connected with the Divine.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|A good book, very easy to read and the anticipation of finding out what really happens, keep me from putting it down.
B008393Q2O|5.0|Everything about the app is excellent. I use the notepad to help me remember the small things as I get older.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|easy to use, easy to read even when its early and only one eye will open! it's a great app
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I enjoy seeing multiple timers. You can time your oven while jogging up and down the street among other uses.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Picks subjects and provides intriguing analysis in a large Chicago law firm.  Extremely well written with fabulous guest stars.  Acting and writing are superb. Intricate plot plans carried to fruition. Keeps your attention from beginning to end. Great series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If there is anything I use a lot, it is this App. To keep up with todays financial challenges you have to stay sharp and you have to know what is out there money wise to keep yourself out of trouble. The convenience of having this on My Kindle Fire is absolutely great!
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Too much chaotic action.. and could not recognize any of the transformers.. they all look the same.<br /><br />I love the old cartoons from the 80's.. they were easy to recognize.. but i can't tell starscream from ironhide.. from megatron.. it's just all a pile of metal flying everywhere and no focus on any of their personalities.. and too much human-focus.<br /><br />I yawned the entire time through this movie and really pushed myself to finish it.<br /><br />It's like they try too hard that they lose the viewer..  much like a comedian that tries too hard to be funny isn't funny.<br /><br />It's hard for me to identify or recognize the transformers.. and the most unlikely things happen over and over and over that it causes a disconnect..<br /><br />The movie is garbage.. and only mildly entertaining just to see a bit of flash..  But I come to this movie, not as a transformers fan.. but as someone that wants to see some mindless action.<br /><br />and I walk away from it thinking how much better of a job I could have done with the franchise if I were in the director's seat.<br />It's a shame.<br /><br />I give is 2 stars because i was entertained somewhat.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I am not crazy about this App. It is very difficult to play on a Kindle Fire, which I have. There is nothing ... no pencil .... no pen...nothing to move Pac-Man except your finger. Do not like the set up. Very upsetting
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Very good shows. If you like this kind of movie you will enjoy all the seasons. I wish it was still on.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a wonderful game to play anywhere. Keeps that mind ticking and is fun to play. I am glad I bought it for my Kindle.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I must say that this was a very cool game. It was nice to have the hints that helped me pass the game. I'm looking forward to the next one.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A really good read. I thought the stream was consistent and the characters were believable. I enjoyed it.<br />I found myself wanting the story to go on and on. Very good book
0451232852|5.0|This book is a wonderful story and portrays many aspects of society and history of the WWI era in Europe and US.  It has been fun reading it aloud and discussing it.  The characters are alive and real.
B000MRA6AK|5.0|I sent this as a gift to my brother-in-law who loves Jazz.  He loves it so much, he keeps in his car and plays it non-stop.  A great classic.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Loved this movie. Action Packed...great humor...tooooooo much blood though! I'll probably watch it many more times. Don't have little kids around to be upset by squirting blood all over the place.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I wasn't disappointed. It was definitely funny, and I shed a few tears. I highly recommend this to people who like erotica and comedy. And be forewarned: there's a lot of sex. For adults only.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have put this AntiVirus on every product I own for two or more years.  On three of my laptops and now on my android.
B00005N6KG|3.0|Not the greatest sound, but adequate.  Very lightweight. Wire is pretty thin. I use them for running, and it beats trying to keep ear buds in.  I also taped a loop of wire coming off the speaker to the headband just above the speaker with black electricians tape.  Can't see it, and not as easy to break the wire if it catches on something, usually your hand, while running.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|These birds can't be stopped! A great leader for an Angry Bird!<br />You will be with an Angry Bird!Wahoo!<br /><br />Angry Birds Away!
0307476073|4.0|I enjoyed this, more once she actually got on the trail than the recitation of her life story. My daughter says it's an Eat Pray Love clone - some truth there but not entirely fair. I didn't get the feeling at the end that she had taken us through the arc of a journey, but the writing is solid and there is plenty to like here. It's more meandering than profound.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good writing, acting, and camera work. A good uncomplicated way to pass the time. Good young looking actors and actresses plod along and really entertain...
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I have a lot of Behringer products because they do the job at a great price. They will last for a long time if not abused and in the event you do have to replace it, the cost is nominal. I liked this so much I bought a second one to leave in my home studio. The tuner does what it is supposed to without breaking the bank. Would recommend to others.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|It makes you realise what is important in life. The 2 main characters knew how to live life. A lesson for us all.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Interesting beautiful picture with many twist and turns. If you want me to rate any more eliminate this BS. Thank you.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|good but not for little kids due to dark scenes, too scary for my 3 or 6 year old boys
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I grew up in Detroit so I have my bias for this movie. This man was almost as good as Bobby Dylan but totally unknown which is too bad and sad.
140123769X|5.0|Fables is a great series! Bill Willingham has created an amazing story with great characters! Always eagerly awaiting the next Volume to see how the plot unfolds, revealing new twists and turns.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This was totally different than what I expected. Almost cartoonish in its presentation but still very good. The cast was top with all the different stars.
1401235166|5.0|Fables is a great series! Bill Willingham has created an amazing story with great characters! Always eagerly awaiting the next Volume to see how the plot unfolds, revealing new twists and turns.<br />This volume leaves you guessing at the end, the fate of Bigby and Snow White's cubs. A fun volume, but not as fun as Vol. 16
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I think the subject matter is an important one to examine.But the book lacks depth. It wasn't what I expected.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Oh my god I wasted my money!! I can't that I did such a thing! Johnny Depp has his funny moments but it wasn't worth the $5 I bought it for.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Yes,he is the frontman for the Moody Blues,and all of the accolades for his work with them are well deserved...but when you hear his spiiritual waves of feeling and lyrics here,with his time proven formula for music and interpretation,you begin to realize the formula,which has given him success on his own merits...he even delves into proverbial country music,which he excels at admirably...a treat for the ear,Justin Hayward,is a fine tuned musician,writer and spiritual master,who never leaves you down,but hopeful for a better day and completion of life,no matter the ups and downs...
1401233066|5.0|Fables is a great series! Bill Willingham has created an amazing story with great characters! Always eagerly awaiting the next Volume to see how the plot unfolds, revealing new twists and turns.<br />There's a lot of action in this volume. Watch the Fables create a team of super heroes and watch as Mister Dark's story comes to a close.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Read this for our book club.  It provided a lot of conversation.  Let me say the ending was a surprise and unique
B002GHHHP6|5.0|This is a great Western-ish comedy about Mel Gibson's character trying to get to a high-rolling poker game, and everyone trying to keep him out of it. Tons of laughs ensue. And if you watch Lethal Weapon first... you understand an awesome Easter Egg, that will make you die laughing.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an increadible journey and it was amazing to read that his women had no experience prior to hicking this trail.
B000W04S6U|4.0|It feels like previous HALO music, but with more instruments this time. So in a way it's getting better. But a lot of the tracks similar  to one another after listening to them a few times.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a very good choice for those who like John Grisham.  However, if you are accustom to reading his books, the racketeer was know from the beginning.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|This is a great soundtrack to go with a great game! There are several songs that I love the most. Can't stop listening to them! More video games should have adaptive music like Metal Gear Rising! And Jamie Christopherson did a great job on this title.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Finally! A family friendly drama that is not overboard on the drama part. Good on Masterpiece Theater. Can't wait for season 3!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I started watching the 1st season just because I was bored one day and I haven't been able to quit watching since!! It has become one of my favorite shows!!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie left me feeling much substance was not included so as to keep with the needs of society's declining attention span.  If this movie had been made twenty years ago, for example, it easily could have been longer and, in effect, have included more substance.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|I was a bit disappointed in the ending as it was too sudden even thpugh the reader knew what was coming, but I am assuming there will be a follow- up book in the wings. I hope so anyway. As is usual for a Jeffrey Archer book, wonderful to read, doesn't get bogged down with unnecessary narrative and unputdownable. Keep up the good work.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|What's not to love?  This animated film is still as captivating as it was decades ago.  It's a family favorite.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|Interesting insights which can be utilized in how you go about your day to day business.  Certainly worth a read.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Great screenplay and wonderful effects.  Great what would you do type of story.  Thought provoking and moving.  reserve plenty of time.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I only wish I could have read this years ago while helplessly watching my mother descend into cognitive impairment. Genova's well written novel hits at the core with elegance and compassion.
B009JZWWGC|5.0|it was amazin'ly brilliant and there was a lot of action which was really brilliant an' mi pop was jumpin' to see it
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoyed all the episodes and am looking forward to more.  I highly recommend it!  It is a favorite of mine.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The story line was excellent and it was well written. The only thing i would change about it is the grammar was lacking with some misuse of words. The author has well developed characters and places. The action and adventure in the book is well thought out and i couldnt put the book down. There are some minor political themes and no adult situations. This is a great read for all ages.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|Can't wait to see the next few seasons. Please be sure to add the soon. Thanks for finding this show...
B003VW8GT6|5.0|Howard Hawks at this best.  The cast leading with John Wayne were great together including a young teenage heart throb Ricky Nelson.  Walter Brennan was my favorite character actor.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I have watched the HBO series, but I wanted more...this is &#34;filling in the blanks&#34;.  HBO has done a wonderful job, but nothing compares to the authors details.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I decided to watch this series after all the &#34;kids&#34; were raving about it....surprisingly, I LOVE it :) I bought the discs for Season 1.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Buying this CD is one of the best purchases I made in my lifetime. I must buy for anyone who is a MJ Fan.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|One of the best shows that I have watched. Especially if you are Terminator fan.Picture quality is simply Amazing. Enough said.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I love the full sound I get from the dolby 7.1 surround. Awesome gaming experience. Everything is crisper and intence.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This and Atlantis are well worth the cost for hours of fun.  Challenging. I highly recommend this app.  You will not be disappointed.  Get them both today.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the ease of playing solitaire. I love the set up and the option to auto finish.I would recommend any and everyone to download this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is very cool. I love taking care of horses (especially when there isn't any real work to do)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I do not lie when I say best game ever. It is fun from the start and until you fall off of a cliff with all of your diamond armor and die.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|Cutesy interaction between a typical American family, along with the daughter's boyfriend, are the most interesting parts of this movie; the newest in a series of what is supposed to be edited together sets of private Youtube-ready videos that happen to catch strange ghostly happenings like books and chairs moving by themselves. And that's a conceptual problem because it's the paranormal activity itself, which revolve around the neighbor's creepy kid, that is supposed to be the star of the show. Instead, since it usually happens at night when nearly everyone is asleep or in the day when hardly anyone is around, it brings the plot to a comparatively dreary slowdown. For that reason, the first half of the movie, which I think also features more close-ups of the cute daughter and her sexy mother, is better than the second half.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this game is pretty cool but it is a lot like most other games out in the internet. Were is some originality?
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My family loves this movie!  Being a gamer myself, there were characters and games that reminded me of my own childhood!  It didn't even have to rely on hidden adult humor to be funny and great!  My boy has also been getting into video games as of late and is totally enthralled by this movie every time we put it on.  Definitely worth the purchase.
0062082353|5.0|This book is one that is hard to put down. I would recommend it to all Americans for good information about Chris.
0151003084|5.0|I love this book. I'm 20 and my brother (18) and grandparents who in their 80's read the book and laughed. It brings out the dark humor in everyone.
B006H5120E|4.0|Very minimal out of screen pop outs, but excellent picture quality in 3D.  May be slightly disappointed if your expecting a lot of out of screen awesome effects.  If you loved titanic and your reason for purchasing this in 3D was primarily for the added depth and picture quality, this won't disappoint.  I highly recommend purchasing!!!
B00AJRKR3Y|1.0|Lukather is, without a doubt, an excellent guitarist, but he rarely busts a solo on this offering, and the songs rate from bad to poor, lacking hooks altogether. His approach is misguided, thus his solo career has never taken off. I might be a fan if he would spare me the attempts at inspiring lyrics, record some music worth hearing, and show off his chops for a change.
B001KQGEL2|5.0|Lov Empire from Queensrych! Thanxs Amazon for making it so easy to download to mp3 player! I listen to it all the time! ;)
B008VN9XMY|5.0|Great, I am going to be getting more from this author! Easy to read, makes the historical events much easier to take in.
0345803493|3.0|I loved the first one couldnt put it down , This one I havent finished , Maybe I will sometime!
B00797MB0O|1.0|The movie was not good I get the ideal but it was not worth making or watching in my opinion
0783110871|5.0|Yes, another review for a Ray Liotta movie! LoL !  It has action , Kind of like Con Air but not as much !
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love it can not wait to  watch the rest of the episodes and the on to the 4 season.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend who said he had lost over ten pounds (so far) on the premise that the author states.  Having taken Medical Biochemistry as a student, the principles the author describes in the synthesis of fats ring true.  And I was reminded that this is why I am having problems trying to lose the weight that I lost and regained on Weight Watchers.  Now that I've read his book, I am applying what I've read in my daily menu and I'm seeing my plateau weight start to decline.
B00005JKZV|4.0|It was good. I would recommend this website. I just wish the movies were full screen not wide screen. But old overall.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|For a movie made in the 1950's it has it's share of cheesy stereotypes and clunky dialog.  However, this film's real contribution to classic science fiction is the presentation of a an age-old problem using a fictional future.  That question is &#34;Can mankind create technology that although done for noble purposes lead to its destruction?&#34;
B009AJD5E0|5.0|This movie still has mysteries....all the way to the end. I loved every moment of it and appreciated the ending
B00003CX9E|5.0|Orson Welles' &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; (1941) has lost none of its social and political relevance. Collaborative filmmaking at its finest, with an impressive acting ensemble (Welles, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead and Everett Sloane in their screen debuts) and groundbreaking photography by Gregg Toland. Ironically, newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst — the primary inspiration for Charles Foster Kane —  has been largely forgotten, yet the film he tried to suppress remains a landmark in cinema history. Classic Dialogue: &#34;If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man.&#34;
B003M6EAXM|5.0|24 started to go off the rails in previous seasons, but season 8 was a redeeming way for the show to go out.  Good stuff. Reminded me why Jack Bauer is my all time favorite TV character.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really could not put it down!  So many twists and turns! Not only suspense but character analysis and revelations!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|very realistic strategy game. I just beat it all the way through and can't wait for new plagues to come out.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent series. Have enjoyed this thoroughly. Great cast. Great writing and story. Just through season 2 so a bit behind but look forward to catching up.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|It seems like the producers asked many people what their favorite horror desires are, and then put them all into this show. I am really looking forward to season 3.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a wonderful game. The music is relaxing, and the game its self overall is relaxing. Works wonderfully on Kindle Fire,  and also the Kindle Fire HD. My brother who is 12 also loves this game, and understands it even though he has learning disabilities.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|This is a very versatile timer or stop watch.  You can configure any type of timer that you would ever want.  In my opinion, it is a bit overdone with icons everywhere.
B009ZQI41C|5.0|So, here is how it happened. It was a trickle down effect. I watched all of the first three seasons via Amazon's Prime Instant Videos. As I was finishing Season 2, my oldest girl (11) got curious and asked if she could see it, too. So, when I was doing her hair, we watched it together. Then her excitement got our son (10) engaged (doesn't usually like British shows), and then our youngest girl (7) - and surprisingly the young one actually paid attention to most of it and told me she liked it, too. She actually remembers parts of it.<br /><br />Very engaging show. It's part of our homeschool. And we'll be reading some of the books about it and sharing on our Butterfly Homeschool Blog, too.<br /><br />Something weird happened with Season 3. I was expecting 11 episodes because that's what they listed on the Amazon site, but they ended it at 9 with a major cliff hanger.<br /><br />So, then I found out that they now have an email alert sign up form for the next season. (Just search for season 4)<br /><br />Initially, I wasn't so sure I was going to like it very much. I had seen bits and pieces of it on regular TV. So, I decided to give it another chance because it was free with Amazon Prime. SOOOOO glad that I did. The one thing I didn't love about the earlier shows, which I feel that they've been resolving in the later shows, was the amount of hostility between the nobels and the regular folks. It seems like their youngest child helped them to become a bit more open. And I really really started loving the show more once I saw a shift in attitudes, a little bit, at least. The tension is still there, but it seems to be shifting gradually with the times.<br /><br />Because I have been to England and traveled through both the countryside and some of the major cities, it thrills me when they take them beyond just the castle in some of the later episodes. If you love the British Isles, you'll definitely enjoy the scenery in these shows.<br /><br />Okay, well I could go on and on, but will stop now. I hope you drop by our homeschool blog and check out the list of books about the show that our friend reviewed and shared with us.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<br /><br />~Donna, The Mommy Butterfly<br />P.S. If you didn't see it, yet, you can preview Season 3 for free here:<br />[[ASIN:B009ZQI41C Downton Abbey Season 3 Preview [HD]]]on, but will stop now.

B001I13PM0|4.0|Fans of Yanni will like it a lot.  Lovers of this type of music will also like it.  There are a few instances where it drags a bit but these are rare.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Ncis is an amazing show. I have been watching it for years and never have been not satisfied by one of the episodes.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I spent a whole weekend glued to my iPad watching this. I don't know why I did not catch the series on TV. So glad I was able to catch up.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I enjoy the TV series Bones and the character of Dr. Brennan.  The book character seemed to be less objective than the series character but all in all it was fascinating to learn of the diamond mines and formation process.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|If you are a fan of the great English detective, then settle in for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventures. These stories are some of his best work. I got it as a free book from Amazon and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who like a good mystery and you cannot beat the price.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I do enjoy the Mahjong challenge.  The progressive puzzles are very good.  The designs and the increased number of tiles is a challenge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|get the game you would love it. I love it. I have a whole lot of coins. get it now.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I liked it because it was suspenseful always kept me guessing, but it went into too much description about NY streets etc. that did not add to the story, just made it longer.
B003M5AXN4|2.0|But not much more.<br /><br />A very good show off disc for your home theater set-up (gorgeous visuals and music), but this movie is very cheesy.<br />Get it cheap.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like the fact I can mix the melodies to form a unique sound that's soothing and tranquil. Would recommend.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|It's annoying that the producers are breaking this into three movies, whereas the much longer Lord of the Rings ended up in three. Otherwise, the cinematography is great as with the rest.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|If one more person says, &#34;there's too much of singing in it&#34;, so help me...it's a musical for crying out loud! It is long but that can't be helped. Prepare yourself. The Jean Valjean story runs through out the movie as the connecting ribbon but you can think of it a two stories Fantine descent into hell and Marius and Cosette's love story. It picks up after Fantine's death not that Ann Hatheway wasn't fantastic. Marius and Cosette's stories are more appealing and the revolution is fun but tragic. Eddie Redmayne is terrific actor and singer. I had never seem him before, so this was a revelation. Where has he been hiding? Don't listen to anything you hear about Russell Crow's performance. He did a magnificent job, his singing and acting were perfect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so addicted to this book I read it 1day and its really awesome and twisted end of story.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|The quality of this dvd was superb, I couldn't have asked for more.  I received my dvd in protective bubble packaging , like new case and well before the due date, HELLO.

1419705849|5.0|It was recently announced that the Wimpy Kid series were being published as Ebooks. I am very happy that the feel of the original books (pictures and all) were not compromised in any way with the switch. I for one am a fan of the digital age and love reading on my devices.<br /><br />In the 7th book in the series The Third Wheel it's Valentines Day in the world of Greg Heffley<br /><br />and he pulls out all the stops to try to get a date. Even going to the extent of having a friend act as his wing man when all of Greg's ideas fail him. Like finding a date is already hard enough, his Uncle has come to visit and is causing all kinds of trouble at home.<br /><br />As Greg reminisces through his life of love, family and the awkwardness of your first school dance. This book was funny, witty and the pictures add personality to the characters and the scenes.<br /><br />Fans of the Wimpy Kid series already know how much fun it is. They do not have to be read in order and now with the ebook release, can be ready anytime, anywhere. Great for long travels and vacation fun

B005LAIHZE|4.0|When you first see a movie titled \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\", you may like many shake your head, laugh or just be in shock that such a ludicrous movie could ever be greenlit by Hollywood, never mind ever getting made. Plus if it were to get made that it would be anything but be-headings, blood and generally cheesy and historically inaccurate throughout the whole running time. Well the filmmakers behind this movie wanted to go a different direction and try to make this film as historically accurate as possible (which like anything that has to do with history is up for debate), while having the violence and vampire attacks that make the second part of the title mean something.<br /><br />The story is remarkably well told, as we see Abe (played as an adult by Benjamin Walker, \\"The War Boys\\") grow from a young boy where he sees his mother killed by a vampire, to a young man where thanks to a vampire named Henry (Dominic Cooper, \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\") has turned good and trains Abe to kill vampires but only those Henry tells him about. Later after opening a shop where he studies law and kills vampires at night he discovers one in particular, his name is Adam (Rufus Sewell, \\"Dark City\\", \\"A Knight's Tale\\") and Adam wants to take over America (really what other kind of villain would he be if he didn't want to). During the vampire killings Abe meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\\") and after some time they get married, settle down and have a child.<br /><br />The film really picks up in the third act when Abe is a little older, is the President of the U.S. and is in the midst of the civil war where vampires are fighting for the Confederacy. The historical stuff and the vampire killings mix well and shockingly it ends up being a great story despite the incredibly goofy premise. The filmmakers did at least take time to study history and provide a good telling of Abe Lincoln's life (whether totally accurate or not is again up for debate). I really did enjoy this as at the end of the day it's meant to be taken as just fun since the idea of a president killing vampires just grabs your attention (whether it be for the right or wrong reasons).<br /><br />It's a fun movie, fun to watch and a blast to watch some good old fashioned bloody killings mixed in with some history, just to keep it leveled out. *** out of 4 starsup for debate).

B00C7LB20C|3.0|Good spy movie; Definitely worth renting. Action scenes are good, and so are the special effects. This is not your Jason Borne character but it comes close.
B009AMALLM|4.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />5 years after then events of the first and second films, we have a young girl named Alex who lives with her parents and her adopted brother Wyatt. Soon after the film opens a young boy named Robbie comes over and apparently his mother is in the hospital and he needs a place to stay as he has no other family to turn to. Well once Robbie gets to the house, odd things begin to happen, strange sounds, things seemingly paranormal shall we say, so Alex and her boyfriend set up computers with running video streaming to capture these hauntings.<br /><br />What follows is the usual bumps in the night, shadows around Alex and others in the house and then once Robbie's mother is back (Katie from the first two flicks), things pick up. The scares get amped up and the deaths are pretty well done especially those in the last 20-30 minutes, the closing sequence may not make too much sense to those uninitiated to the series (how did all those people fit in the backyard of a standard sized house comes to mind) but if you've seen the first 3 films it makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />I did enjoy this one, sure it doesn't really add a ton to the series in the end, but it actually was entertaining overall. Nothing grand but fun. **1/2 out of 4 stars.<br /><br />Side Note: The Blu-ray version does have a crisper picture and the deleted scenes and special features make it worth shelling out the bucks for.

B0035LGXXO|4.0|I like this one because of the action. The acting bites. But, what i get out of this is that there are bad people in this world. They will do anything no matter who they hurt. The warriors struggled getting back to their town. They were accussed of something they never did. They were lied about. In the process they lost people. This happens in everyday life. Reputations are destroyed because of jealousy or simply because someone wants to look better than the other. This is usually is the result of greed or a quest for attention. But, in the end justice was served. The truth came out and the bad people paid the price. Sometimes we don't see justice served here on earth. So it was refreshing to see the bad guys get exterminated.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I received the Anker Mouse much quicker than I expected. Arrival time will vary, but you'll still be met with simple and prompt service from Anker. I had multiple friends trying to convince me to get a Razer mouse instead of this. I decided to give Anker a chance, and I'm glad I did. Instead of spending $80 or more on a Razer mouse, get Anker for half the price and, so far, all the performance. I haven't had any problems with the mouse yet. No buttons have failed or double-clicked. This isn't a huge problem, but I wished Anker had specified that only the Anker symbol changes colors. The rest of the lights on the mouse don't change, they stay blue. I also wished that the weight Tuning made more of a difference. I'm not saying it doesn't change anything, you can feel a difference, I had just expected a wider range of weight. After using the mouse, you get used to the weight tuning and it isn't a problem anymore.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great series with many twist and turns. If Michone ( spelling ?) dies off in the next  season, I'm done. That's the only drawback. Favorite characters die off. Michone is the best! But, this show is  fiction obviously but, I think in the case of a global tragedy or an apocalypse of some sort it shows what lengths people will go through to survive. How some will work together but,<br />yet some want all the power. It does prove though, most human beings are willing to help each other. Just think how you would react.<br />Would you help people or would you try to grab the power?

He was a grumpy man who realized he didnt spend the time with his daughter that he should have.<br />The time he spend with her, taught her something. Something she really loved. When they really reconnected, She took that and used it to her advantage to build up her realationship with her dad. Also, this movie tells you that you could be the fancy pants with the money but, what good is it if your not happy. She finally got to do what she really loves. How many people hate what they do for a living but, they do it to provide. You could still provide by doing what you love.

0380807343|5.0|What happens when you run into a brick wall, figuratively speaking of course? You go get the key. And if that key eventually takes you to an alternate reality - a parallel universe, ghosts, ghouls, a twilight zone? Where you have a new set of parents wanting to give more tender, loving care your real parents will not, or cannot, but which would cost you your heart and soul, for all eternity? Can you get to keep your soul and get your real parents back? That, in short, is the premise of this creepily darkish short novel for kids.<br /><br />Coraline is a precocious kid who almost everyone insists on calling Caroline, who lives with her loving but preoccupied parents in a huge house. So huge, in fact, that it has been divided into multiple houses, occupied by interesting characters for sure. There is an old man who is trying to train mice for a circus show, and who have a message for Coraline - they are the only ones in the house, apart from her parents, who seem to get her name right, and there are two retired stage actresses who think of their days of glory long gone and reading tea leaves to tell the fortune and fate of anyone walking through their door. So one day, Coraline is thoroughly bored because it has been raining outside, and takes up her father's advice to go counting. Counting things like the number of windows in the house, the number of doors in the house, and finds that one door is locked and blocked. Her mother even shows her that. Till it is no longer bricked and blocked, and Coraline walks through the door one day when her parents are not in the house. There are parents in the other house, where her other mother has buttons for eyes, and her nails are just that longer than normal, and her other mother wants to keep Coraline in the other house. Except that she cannot, because of something in Coraline's pocket. Coraline's real parents, on the other hand, have gone missing. Or have they? Can Coraline find her parents, and get away from her seriously creepy and scary other parents.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has written a dark and gripping story that may not be suitable for all eight year olds. Adults will however love the book. The book reminded me at least a little bit of Roald Dahl's books. Yes, almost all of them are seriously creepy, especially \\"The Witches\\". This book ratchets up creepy just a little notch more. Coraline is one tough nut who is brave - read the book to find out!<br /><br />This is the first book of Neil Gaiman I have read, and I am itching to read some more!eepy and scary other parents.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has written a dark and gripping story that may not be suitable for all eight year olds.

B0064MGU98|4.0|I know a lot of people liked the Good Wife, but I never had time to watch.  It seemed like lots of other legal shows, and I couldn't imagine why I'd want to watch.  Thanks to Amazon, I started watching at Season 1 a few weeks ago just as a trial.  I'm so glad I did.  Ridley Scott produces.  Why did no one ever tell me this?  Anyway, the production values are excellent, as is the cast.  You all know the basic framework if you've read other reviews, so I won't bore you with it.  But I will say that the stories are very complex -- it's not just &#34;a resolved case a week&#34;, it's someone trying to live a complicated life around a case a week at the office.  And the two sometimes intersect.  The law stuff generally is okay  (as far as these shows go -- let's face it, no one gets it all right), but the excellent cast keeps it ahead of the usual.  I'm hooked.  And that surprised me.
B00003CXIP|5.0|One of the best!!!  A great story of youth, being a boy, bonding, losing your sense of innocence, everything is right there.  A great film adaptation of King's short story, which is rare.  Hollywood usually goes for the gore, ignoring the relationships in his stories.  Just think of &#34;The Shining&#34;, or &#34;Pet Semetary&#34;...what bombs!!  Lousy adaptations of great stories.  Anyway, this one clicked!!  Probably because of Reiner's superb direction...
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game the low reviews are from people who play it on phones. This app is great for iPad kindle and other tablets.

1451662432|3.0|This book has parts that are just downright difficult to wade through, but if you can plow through sections where Arnold continually passes the buck on responsibility for everything from bad movies to his affair with his housekeeper of 14 years that supposedly took place in only one week while Maria was away, then it's worth finishing.  While I admire his accomplishments, it's clear that Arnold is never honest with himself and therefore, cannot be honest with the reader.  He's always holding something back and passing the buck.  As other reviewers stated, this clearly is also an attempt to publicly apologize to Maria and to beg for her to take him back.  Not very likely.  I knew he was an egomaniac, but I also thought he was more aware of his limitations and more mature than several sections of the book portray.  The way he swoons over certain women (JLC, Helga Testorff's breasts, etc.) is a glimpse at the real Arnold.  The one Maria, moviegoers, and the citizens of California all got sick of.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I am finding this volume tedious and hard to stick with not only due to what seem unrelated or distant story lines but particularly due to the narrator.  He tries to change voice with each character but they all sound much the same--even Brienne sounds like an old, wizened elf.  It's actually difficult for me to follow dialogue because the voices sound so similar.  I would rather read it than listen to this volume.  I would also recommend sticking to the chapters with the known characters and skipping the unknown ones.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I needed this app over winter break because I was just so bored! I found it to be an excellent time waster and very simple to navigate.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Until I read this I had never focused consciously on the degree to which the world, and especially the business and political world, is dominated by and organised to favour extroverts. Brainstorming, team activities and open plan can be very productive settings for some people, but others produce their best work when allowed space and time to think things through in depth by themselves. We need both kinds, but our current practices are heavily skewed in favour of extroverts. Susan Cain explores this by looking at both the existing scientific research and at individual experiences.<br />Of course the division of the world into introverts and extroverts is a gross oversimplification. Most people are introverted in some situations and extroverted in others. Nonetheless, most of us have a general sense of where, on the introverxion/extroversion continuum, we generally fall; and to that extent the underlying analysis makes sense.<br />Ms. Cain is not arguing that introversion is better than extroversion (or vice versa). Instead, she is making a good case for recognising that both are valuable, but that in order to make people comfortable, and to bring out the best in them, we may need to be more flexible in the social and work patterns we expect and enforce.<br />An interesting and refreshingly different way to look at things.

Etienne St. Clair! Without him this book wouldn't even exist! He's everything you could want in a boy! I'm just cutting the chase, no preamble. It's all about Etienne St. Clair. Oh, and Anna, of course.<br />Etienne reminded me of Augustus Waters from the The Fault In Our Stars. Maybe a healthier version of him though they are completely different I felt some similarity between them that I couldn't pinpoint. Augustus just kept popping in my mind whenever I read about Etienne and I had this few seconds of heart contraction. (If you've read the book you would know.<br /><br />A short preamble. Yes, this is a preamble for Anna and the French Kiss which should have come first in my review but... Oh, all I wanted to type was about Etienne! Okay, back to the preamble.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant lives in Atlanta but suddenly her parents ship her to an American Boarding School in Paris. She takes a lot of time adjusting and even though Paris is a lovely city to describe and brag about, Anna takes her own sweet time with it. She does make a few friends and also develops a huge crush on Etienne and then the story spirals up and down and it made me gasp and smile and gasp and smile and finally say, 'AWWWWW!'
0345803485|5.0|If you're looking for a review of the book. Well, I'm glad I read it so that I know what all the fuss was about. But I didn't really think it was all that shocking. I think it turned out to be a romance novel with a twist to the usual bodice ripping scenes. The author overuses the word &#34;hitches&#34; in regards to the characters' catching their breath. She overused it to the point that I was ready to put the book down without finishing it. And the female lead reminded me of the Twilight lead &#34;Bella&#34;. There is nothing evident to suggest that this girl is unique in any way. Certainly nothing that would distract a 100-year old vampire who's had umpteen encounters with other females and in Anastasia Steele's case, nothing in her personality to make a character like Christian Grey sit up and take notice. It was an ok book. I'm astounded it was so popular. I'd recommend it if you want something light and easy and quick to read.

B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Cruise is a great actor but at 50, not quite convincing as a hot bodied that his 30 year old co-star is supposed to fall for.  The style seemed a bit over the top but even with that, I found the main character somewhat awkward, unconvincing and just weird. In many ways, the supporting characters were more convincing. He was almost trying too hard.<br /><br />Even with those issues, I thought it was good entertainment. The story and action were great as were the bad guys. It's good, just didn't quite live up to it's potential.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Day-Lewis gives his usually excellent performance, though uncharacteristically quiet and subtle.  Many other trenchant performances by an array of familiar faces.  Tommy Lee Jones' grizzled portrayal of Representative Thaddeus Stevens deserves special recognition.  Authentic feeling.

B009IEXKXI|2.0|From the opening line, I could tell this book was not going to go well. And by the middle of the book I found that I was not wrong. I could never identify with the main character because he seemed... odd. His banter was intellectual at times, but very often sophomoric and unseemly. The characters were supposedly a professional bunch, sometimes working in an office atmosphere, but who often and freely use the most extreme foul language. This simply didn't seem realistic to me.<br /><br />To complete the sophomoric atmosphere the book was, apparently, not proof read. There were many grammatical mistakes in my copy, including the use of the words \\"in to\\" when \\"into\\" should have been used. In fact the word \\"into\\" never even appeared in the book.<br /><br />After about halfway through the book I became bored with the constant, detailed, \\"scientific\\", step by step, explanations and began to skim to the end.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book.
B005HEPJBY|5.0|This was written and produced at the peak of Sci-Fi genre of TV shows. At the near end of the epic era of TV, I wish they'd went on for much longer than it did. All the captains are good, however Patrick Stewart is a fine actor and gave it a bit of a humanizing feel of a captain, like with Data sometimes it comes out as Mr. Dater or  Datra. :) He has an Android, it has unlimited calling and a huge solid state drive and interstellarnet connection. :) LOL
B009FZFONO|4.0|Enjoyed this season very much. I wasn't too impressed with Merrill's character arc (really abrupt character change) but overall the season was great.
B005HEQ864|5.0|This entire series was short lived, the way it started and ended is epic. It however would of not done so well if it was in the early 80s or last decade.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Our family loves how I met your mother.  We watch it as often as we can.  Barney is such a funny character.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I didn't start watching Downton Abbey until the 3rd season.  Now we are hooked and have gone back to watch the first two seasons.  Now so many things make sense.  It is a great show where people actually have relationships, conversations and there is no swearing and killing.  We love it!!
B0034G4P80|2.0|The movie is not the worst I've ever seen, but I am disappointed that the audio volume level is much too low for the DVD.  Standard volume for all my other DVDs are 4 times louder than this for the voice track.  Turning up the tv to maximum volume to hear what the actors are saying and having to turn down the volume for each and every explosion makes this movie just too much trouble to even keep in my video library.  I'm donating it to GoodWill - maybe someone who doesn't mind watching with subtitles to read along will enjoy this.
B009IEXKXI|1.0|Fortunately only spent a dollar. Quit after about ten percent. They made me add extra words to this review even though I thought I had said enough
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|Ice Age: Continental Drift is basically like the other Ice Ages movies with one exception: this time the focus on adventure and excitement is much MUCH faster, uncontrollable and flat out zannier this time around.  I mean significantly crazier, haha.  I'd honestly need to watch Continental Drift about 3 more times to really be able to keep up with the many assortment of animal flips, dives, jumps, rolls, leaps, etc.  Don't get me wrong- there's a storyline present, but it's not always obvious.  Quite often you have to wait for storyline progressing segments to occur.<br /><br />When an iceberg separates the mammoth played by Ray Romano and leaves his wife (played by Queen Latifah) and their daughter on their own, the mammoth and saber-toothed cat accidentally go on a little iceberg adventure involving tons of oceanic creatures coming into the picture and causing hilarious chaos (especially the one with the crab and the sloth- I love this one in particular).<br /><br />Soon after, they make landfall and find themselves trapped against an ape who claims to be the king of the ocean so fighting against him is entirely hopeless.  Also, a female saber-toothed gray cat comes into the equation and reluctantly fights against (and eventually with) the mammoth, cat and sloth.  However in order to join in with the gang of familiar animals we all know and love, she has to separate herself from the ape whose quest is solely on destroying our loveable talkative animals... which proves to be quite a difficult decision for the cat.<br /><br />I'd say Continental Drift offers a ton of excitement, however the one problem is that many of the jokes fall flat.  I'm not a Nicki Minaj fan so her presence is pretty pointless and uninteresting.  I *am* however, a fan of Wanda Sykes who provides a few really hilarious lines.  Unfortunately Continental Drift focuses on humor that people like Nicki Minaj, Snooki and others would prefer, and the same can be said for the rather uninspiring soundtrack we hear throughout the movie.  These issues crop up more than a few times.<br /><br />The squirrel's tireless search for the nut and unintentionally finding himself in several tricky situations returns yet again, and it never stops being funny (or weird) how the storyline involving the other animals suddenly stops so we can watch the mischievous squirrel go on a little adventure concerning his nut.  Always entertaining watching these segments.<br /><br />Overall, well it's a totally zanny adventure.  This time it's crazier than usual.  Enjoy.

B00005JNS0|2.0|Disney obviously made this weak film just as an excuse to make money selling toy cars to little boys. I was kind of bored in the theater with this film. I didn't find the idea of cars talking that interesting, the characters are bland and boring, the story doesn't work greatly, and there's barely an evil villain to work with. This Pixar film wasn't too acclaimed as opposed to the other Pixar films such as \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\". Reviews for this film were positive enough to pass but not greatly, and it was not a giant hit at the box office. The only reason why its popular is that Disney uses this film just to sell car toys to little kids. I didn't really like playing with cars as a little kid, and I still see it boring. This film is one of the sterotypical boy thing that I don't really like when I go out to the Disney store or Disney world. I don't normally play this game, but in my opinion, \\"Cars\\" is just for kids, and I mean 2-4 year old boys more likely. I really wish Disney would focus more on other balanced films than this.  The fact that this film made so much money from the toys is why \\"Cars\\" was the first Pixar film other than \\"Toy Story\\" to give a sequel, and guess what; \\" Cars 2\\" became Pixar's least critically successful film. That is one of the stupidest things Disney has ever done all because of greediness! And it's al thanks to \\"Cars\\"! It's effortless, weak, boring, unbalanced, and just an excuse for greediness, one of the things about Disney I don't really like.
B00993FEUK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, however, it failed to completely engage me, and I had to watch it over three separate sessions of about a half hour each. This may also be a personal preference thing, for I'm verrrry tired of zombies in what has become an over-saturated market (I didn't read the synopsis of the movie before I watched it, and I was hoping for a variety of paranormal creatures)... but if you're a zombie fan, you'll probably love it.<br /><br />To its credit, \\"Paranorman\\" does have endearing characters (with the rather dense bodybuilder, Mitch, being my favorite), and I really appreciated that the creators went with a different approach regarding the animation. It's a huge departure from the usual animated fare (I'm a huge animated movie fan, and I watch almost all of them as they're released), and it has a sort of \\"Tim Burton\\" vibe to it. Personally, I prefer something along the lines of Pixar's animation style, but I applaud the staff of \\"Paranorman\\" for trying something unique, rather than just being another imitator.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Had the free app in the previous version and loved it. So I upgraded to Platinum and liked it too.<br /><br />Then my Fire started messing up and Amazon sent me a new Fire. When I opened my AccuWeather Platinum it wasn't what I bought but some  buggy mere shadow of it's previous self. Living in Oklahoma most of us can read a weather map and radar almost as well as a meteorologist. The new version is farce. The radar is so jumpy it goes to a white screen before moving on to try to do what the old version did so well.<br /><br />Contacted the CS of AccuWeather and was told Amazon no longer sold the version I bought so I'm stuck with this piece c*app!<br /><br />Wish I had my money back, I'd go buy or get something for free that actually worked as well as this used to be.

B001ANSSDC|1.0|This book is about unlikeable characters in a plot where nothing happens. There was no one to cheer for and nothing whatsoever to think about. The writing style wasn't even up to a 4th grade level. I don't understand how this book got to be made into a movie.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Great Story line and Superior graphics are hard to find in one movie. This one does it with grace and dignity. It also puts forth the dilema of the Military Industrial Complex that IKE first warned us about so many years ago. Buy it NOW. THIS ONES A KEEPER.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Here are sides of Pendergast we haven't seen. From the highs of lost love re-discovered, to the depths of self-destruction to the even darker realms of retribution, Two Graves is an emotional roller-coaster for our favorite nigh emotionless hero.<br />There are to side plots that dont serve the story directly but are enjoyable enough on their own and are nice breaks from the tension of the main line.<br />Make no mistake, the body count is high! Pendergast's path back to his favorite club chair in front of the fire in the library of Riverside Drive is strewn with corpses. We've all known Pendergast is wrapped a little tight. But so is dynamite. And like dynamite, once what is caged within is allowed its' full and natural expression, terrible violence erupts.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This movie was made on location in MT. OLYMPUS. Maybe they really existed. It has been said that legends have some basis in fact. History is filled with examples. Thor and the other GODS will never die, for they are forever kept alive in man's imagination. Get it now.

B009DZDJU6|5.0|WOW! Whoever thinks up these crazy story lines is beyond imagination. The mere fact that a film crew, actors and a briliant director makes it all work is amazing! I am a history buff, so I am hard to please with secret possibilities about what might have happened. I have to say that all the pieces fit together to the point of believability! GET IT NOW!
B004J4WNL2|3.0|This was a great affirmation for me as an insecure (sometimes) introvert. It definitely gave me a feeling of being part of a respected and intelligent group. I was interested to note that Susan pointed out that introverts aren't necessarily shy. I am very shy at first, but once I know people I am very bubbly and have plenty to say. That used to confuse me, and it certainly confuses other people. There are some good coping methods in the book as well as having some good reminders that we don't have to change everything about ourselves to fit into the extroverted world. I give the book 3 stars because my extroverted husband found some of the book rather insulting to him, and a lot of the information was very repetitive. Overall, I think it's worth reading for introverts who need a little boost.

B008B403VS|5.0|This fantastic model is straight from Japan, manufactured by Takara Tomy. Consequently, nearly all text included with the model is in Japanese.  This is not a huge hinderance, as the transformation process is fairly easily understood with the graphical depictions in the instructions, but if you wanted to read up on, say, the history of the character or read an important detail about the model, then you must learn to read Japanese or get it translated by someone.<br /><br />The model itself in robot form stands approximately 9 inches high, and is made entirely of plastic.  No die cast parts are included.  The complexity of the model makes it a poor choice for young children or irresponsible adults, but the detail is the highest of any Soundwave model on the market, and as such could be considered the standard by which all others are measured.  The index finger on both hands is articulated with two joints, and the other fingers are articulated with one.  This allows Soundwave to &#34;point&#34; and be posed in a variety of ways, given the rest of his extensive articulation is taken into consideration.<br /><br />The model includes Soundwave's blaster, a miniature Megatron in gun mode that the model can hold in either hand, an &#34;energon cube&#34; that mounts with a simple snap to the model's cassette door, and as an awesome bonus, also includes Laserbeak, the cassette tape that transforms into a bird, and looks very similar to how it did in the animated show. The cassette tape includes its own case as well. The cassette door on the model's chest opens and the tape can be stored inside.  As another bonus, the rear wall of the cassette cavity can be pushed back to hold up to three separate cassettes, sold separately. Ravage, Rumble, Frenzy and Buzzsaw are all sized to fit and work with this model.<br /><br />In portable cassette player mode, the model is very solid.  Most attachments, such as the scanner piece, and the blaster, either fold down and store somewhere onthe model, or attach firmly in an inconspicuous place to make the alternate mode look very clean and remove any worries about lost parts.  The parts that do not attach (energon cube, megatron blaster, cassette case) should be stored where they won't be misplaced.<br /><br />The only downside was the price.  To pay this price, there should be substantial die-cast content, and as stated earlier, there is none.  Be sure you are careful with this; it is not designed to withstand great wear and tear, and is best suited for serious adult collectors and enthusiasts.  The Japanese text printed on the box and in the literature helped to reinforce the authenticity of the product.  I'm very satisfied with the product overall.  Great purchase for enthusiasts and collectors.  Shop around for the best price.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This trilogy is an extended story of the type found in Playboy. I don't think a movie should be made of it. What will you show, even to a &#34;sophisticated&#34; audience?
1451620829|4.0|Longtime KISS fan here. I absolutely loved this book, but the pacing is terrible. Whole years are skipped, and you really feel only the tip if the iceberg is being reported.<br /><br />Peter is brutally honest, but also a classic whiner, crybaby, and mental midget. He literally cries through half of the book about how ''Everyone in the world is screwing him over'', and rarely takes responsibility for his child like antics. Still, the honesty is refreshing. There are also some wildly funny bits, usually involving Ace.<br /><br />Being a KISS fan since I was a child, I can honestly say I've lost all respect for the original members. You most likely will also, after reading this book.<br /><br />So, read this at your own discretion. As a KISS fan, you may be heartbroken afterwards.

B004JHYRP4|4.0|I found the story line more satisfying than not, but the science was more than interesting.  The science, while surely not likely, was written in a way, and described in sufficient detail, as to easily allow the reader to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story.

B005COO1X6|5.0|Wonderful Stephen King book in the vein of IT, Salem's Lot, and especially Christine.  This is a great little novella. Just long enough to make you think twice next time you see a car that might need help.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|Cunningham's depth of understanding of Woolf's life and work is profound, and it gives him the freedom to play with her style, her themes, characters and motifs in a way that reveals new meaning in &#34;Mrs. Dalloway,&#34; the novel upon which &#34;The Hours&#34; is based.
B0018RC7QE|2.0|Married man meets married woman- they start dating- where does it lead! You know before the movie gets going. Like I said- not terribly bad- it has two big time stars in it - but I wouldn't waste a sunny afternoon watching it! It was rainy the day I watched it!

B00ABO573A|4.0|This film portrays a somewhat negative look at a particular gay relationship involving drug and alcohol addiction, infidelity, dishonesty and a gamut of other character flaws.

B000002ETI|5.0|The title song on this album, Hey, brought tears to my eyes the first time I heard it. You just can't say some things in English as well as you can in Spanish. This album is entirely composed of musical gems from the whimsical Paloma Blanca to the jaunty Ron y (rum and) Coca Cola. All beautifully sung.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have been fighting depression since both my parents crossed over within 12 months of each other, but after reading this book I realized that I still have to live on in this world and being depressed isn't going to be positive for my own health.  This book is very inspiring for me to sit up and look at my own personal circumstances and start living because sooner or later I will cross over myself and its time for me to achieve my own personal objectives in this lifetime before I do.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead was an extremely pleasant surprise during season one...it seemed to come out of nowhere, if you weren't a fan of the graphical novels.<br /><br />The plot lines have been, of course, fantastical yet also very grounded...allowing watchers to ask themselves the most fundamental questions of these scenarios:  What if I were to face such a situation?  How would I respond?  How would I cope?<br /><br />That it wasn't about survivalists or preppers, per se, is also good.  It was/is simply about some normal people living their lives...and suddenly those normal lives are taken away and they are thrust into the nightmare that never ends.<br /><br />Season 3 continued the high quality of the show--maybe even upped them.  These folks are walking through the valley of the shadow of death...and no punches are pulled.<br /><br />I had only one real unanswered question from this season:  WHY did the governor want to kill off so many other survivors?  Jealousy?  Wanted to be the biggest fish in a pond kept intentionally under-populated?  The guy is insane, of course...but even insane people have SOME reason for what they do, if only in their own minds.<br /><br />I do object to the (mostly-profiled) nudity inserted into some of the episodes...it wasn't necessary, nor did it add anything to the plot lines.  Huh?  What?  WHY??  Just a chance to show off some gal's skin and earn a TV-MA rating, for whatever reasons.
0446580848|4.0|Still reading but it is so far in true DeMille form. It leads you laughing all the way to a suspensful climax. The interseting thing about DeMille is - there are really people like him.
B0091WUZJE|4.0|This is a movie that grows on you...some parts are tough to watch, with some real grit and moral questions.<br /><br />I like it far better now than I did 20 years ago, though.  Perhaps it is something that comes with the maturity of aging a bit...understanding the bitter drive of a loner man to rescue a young girl from danger...and the last shot is a classic in all film discussions.<br /><br />If you watch, be prepared for a grittier, dirtier tale than most Westerns...there's not necessarily any &#34;good guys&#34; in this movie.  But there is a clear question of &#34;which side will you choose to be on,&#34; and also &#34;how far will you go&#34; in even a noble quest.<br /><br />It's worth your time.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Each episode keeps you wanting more.  The lead characters are awesome as are the actors that play them.  I would recommend this to any one who liked 24.
B000I14UTS|1.0|I actually never got to watch this movie in my younger days; it was slightly too mature for me when it came out, and without VCRs or DVDs there weren't many chances to see movies again, once they were out of theaters.  I did see the occasional clips of course, and knew that it was what cemented Lisa Minnelli as a major movie star, and included such stars as MIchael York...plus the movie won numerous awards...so I figured it must have something going for it.  Thus, I finally watched it the other day via Instant Video.<br /><br />What an ABSOLUTE waste of (my)) time and (the stars') talent.  Boring, stupid, nonsensical are the kindest words I can spare for this colossal flop.  I had to turn it off about 70 minutes into it....it was just too painful to watch these stars trying to salvage such awful material.<br /><br />Productions values were low, Liza Minnelli was STULTIFYING in the role (or was that the script's fault?) and York was left twisting in the hand, in terms of not having anything real in his role to grab on to.<br /><br />Maybe Cabaret was ground-breaking or something in its day; perhaps some see it as a classic, in terms of its focus on &#34;gay&#34; themes in a mainstream movie.  Today, it is just an old, bad movie that should be retired...permanently.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|If you liked Evora, try this CD. We have added<br />El Ultimo Trago to our daily diet of Music and songs.
B00B9LNJ9I|2.0|Opinions seem to be rather polarized on this album based on reviews here and elsewhere. I decided to give it a few weeks before writing a review, as my opinion has changed given time before; for example, I hated the album 10,000 Days by Tool when it was initially released, and now believe it to be perhaps their strongest effort. It must be stated that I am (like most reviewers here) a long-time Dido fan, and that I purchased the Deluxe extended edition.<br /><br />I wanted to like this entire album. I really did. I do, in fact, very much enjoy the tracks \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"End of Night,\\" both of which are as good and interesting as anything Dido has ever released. I would even go so far as saying that the former is amongst her finest songs. I kept the CD in my car for several weeks in order to give it a chance, but eventually found myself just listening to these two songs over and over before finally replacing the albums with Tom Waits a few days ago.<br /><br />I do not necessarily dislike the remix of \\"Everything to Lose\\" included on this album, but rather prefer the version from the Sex and the City soundtrack, which I like quite a bit. I just do not see myself playing this album's version often while owning another that I prefer. This is a matter of preference, which seems to be the ongoing theme of this review.<br /><br />As for the rest of the tracks, they are simply...there. This bothers me, because I've never experienced this while listening to Dido before. It was immediate love with the first two albums, and although it took a couple listens for Safe Trip Home to grow on me, I now love it and it contains two of my favorite Dido songs (\\"Grafton Street\\" and \\"The Day Before the Day\\"). I mention these two songs to point out that I am perfectly fine with the quieter efforts, of which there are several on Girl Who Got Away. Most of the tracks here just never grabbed me, and as much as I am loathe to admit it, I have a difficult time pulling several of the songs upin memory while looking at the album's track listing. Apathy is worse than hatred, and I do not like feeling this way about the work of someone I admire so greatly. It happens though, and tastes change. This album is simply not for me (with the exception of the two aforementioned songs, which garnered the album its two stars--one for each song I like and will regularly listen to).<br /><br />In closing, I feel that I must address the rap, as it seems to be a point of contention with many people. I like Eminem, and like \\"Stan.\\" I also grew up on a healthy diet of Wu-Tang Clan and NWA, so please do not tell me that I have a problem with rap when I say that I find it both jarring and frankly distracting in its use on this album. As stated earlier, it simply is not for me in this particular instance. So it goes. Hopefully Dido's next album will be more to my liking.
B007HYV56U|4.0|Plot is kind of ho-hum, but amazing cars, driving scenes and shots of 1970's Europe make this movie well worth watching. Even has a cameo appearance by Graham Hill.
0385736002|5.0|Full of Fantasy in the modern world--wizards/warlocks in the modern world. Great set of books. After finishing this one, I got the others as a set for my kindle ap. Then, got this one as a gift for one of my friend at work, she also loved it.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|This DVD was bought as part of my on going efforts to upgrade my collection to Blue ray. The item was delivered promptly, and the condition and appearence were as described
0515149489|5.0|Good book if you like dogs. Book was in great condition. Good author, suspensful story. Price was also very good.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Lark Rise and Candleford are two charming little towns in England, one close to the soil, the other more prosperous and inclined to adapt to modernity. The one thing that unites them is that most of the main characters have been to the local community college to study Psychology and all have apparently been reading back issues of Psychology Today. This enables them to do an unusual amount of introspection and gives them an abilty to articulate their feelings an a way that would make them proud in any 1990's support group. Another oddity is dialogue that has a generous springling of 21st century colloquialisms which sound a bit off key in Victorian England. In spite of this, Lark Rise to Candlford is very engaging and Julia Sawalha presides over it all with warmth and good humor.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|A Pride and Prejudice is a must read for everyone. Even if you've never read any Austen, you owe it to yourself to read this.
0061780308|5.0|This is the most wonderful audio book. Listening brings the characters to life. Enzo the dog is wonderfully portrayed.<br />I now look at my dog in a different light. The story is told by the dog and how he views the world of humans. This book is for anyone that loves their dog. The situations are sometimes sad, but teaches us to keep fighting for what is important.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a GREAT movie. The DVD is very good. Got it here on Amazon for a super price.<br />The extras are wonderful. So much behind the scenes stuff. Loved the book too. Read it sometime. They did change a few things from the book, but overall it is still great. Cant wait till Dec 13 for the next installment :-)  A Grand little hero is Bilbo Baggins.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie was beautiful and touching.  It stands up to the stage production!  Hugh Jackman deserved his recognition at the Oscars and would have won hands down if Lincoln hasn't been made!
0451232852|5.0|I don't believe I have ever read a book by Ken Follett that I didn't absolutely love. What is the name of the 3rd book in the trilogy of Fall of Giants? I can't wait to know and I can't wait to get my name on the list!! I have read most of his books and never thought I would love espionage or history like I do when I read his books. Thanks Ken, keep up the excellent work!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Another great season.  Highly recommend all seasons! The characters are starting to be even more developed and you can't help but fall in love with all of them!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Held my interest until the very end. Twist and turns not predicable. Page turning novel. Very light reading for the summer.
B005LAIIFS|3.0|Good story.  Long for younger kids and a little dark.  I would recommend it for kids over ten.  Some scenes were very well done and beautiful!  Adults would like it too!  Toys were cute added bonus!
B001EC2IV2|4.0|Schwarzenegger sure makes a fun movie.  Great entertainment.  Vanessa Williams is thrown in, but does not distract from the film.  James Caan is a great villain.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis was amazing and I see now why he won the Oscar.  He is a brilliant character actor and you forgot it was him!!  The movie is not a action movie but a very good historical piece.  I learned even more about my favorite President.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|I’ve watched this movie several times (extended director’s version), and probably will again. Admire the hero at lot, who displays a magnitude of honor.  But it is very much anti-Christian, and pro-Muslim. And that Hollywood fact is getting more than old.
0553801473|2.0|I really wanted to like this book after having loved books 1-3 and forced my way through 4 but sadly I could not. As others have written, nothing really happens in the book. Part of me almost wishes HBO finishes the series out at this point which is really sad to me. I will wait to read some reviews on #6 before I purchase it, whenever that may be.
B00746O3X8|5.0|Totally hands free movement- top QUALITY well thought out product- for under $40.00 don't even think about it- BUY IT!
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|I decided to rent this movie now than wait a few weeks and see it on the big screen.  I enjoyed it.  It's not a &#34;Hollywood&#34; movie.  There isn't a glossy look and storyline.  It's realistic and cold and despite another reviewers comment, she (the daughter) didn't whine that much.  Or maybe I thought she acted like a teenager getting to know her father while missing her dead mother and living in a foreign country.  I liked enough of the trailer to want to see this movie and it took me for a ride.  The plot and action was enough to keep me in the picture and interested in how it would end.  That is what I look for in a movie.  The bonus was watching in my pj's while eating popcorn with real butter.<br /><br />Is this a great movie?  No.  Is this a good movie?  Yes, it is to me.  That's why I gave it four stars.  The average is a three, but you know...I may read the reviews but in the end I make up my own mind.<br /><br />I didn't notice a sound problem on my iPad.  I did get it on ITunes though.  Sorry Amazon, you do get most of my rentals but you really need to put better ads on your app than tv series and prime shows.  As a new Prime member I know how to search for the free stuff.  I didn't know you did pre release.
B000I8H7RI|5.0|I already rated it previously and thought it was a good movie.  I wonder what it would look like now with the new technology out there.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Love Sex and the City, so I couldn't wait to own my own set. However, I HATE the poor quality of these discs. It's a lot of money to spend and not be able to see full episodes or have them skip and stop and fail. And it's not my dvd player, because I've tried them on 3 different players and it happens on all of them. It's obviously damaged from wherever or whomever burned them.<br />Very disappointed!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|Figured there would be more faster paced than it was.  My girlfriend thought it was going to be very emotional, but halfway through we were both already doing other things and just had it on as background noise.  I usually don't rate things with a 1 star, but this movie really didn't keep my attention at all.<br /><br />Just wasn't my type of movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I got a new Galaxy III phone and my wife has a Iphone IV.  She had kindle on her phone, so I am having a new baby girl and decided it was time to get a new phone and get some books to read to her.  The old days of ordering books on paperback/hardcover are gone.  I have the entire Harry Potter books series on my kindle plus all the books my wife had previously and I still have loads of room on my phone.  They go everywhere with me, they don't weigh anything other than &#34;the phone&#34; and you can make the text to read as large as you want.  You can read in the dark.  And kindle makes it easy to find new books and continue the reading adventure.  I am sure to pass this along to my new baby girl.  What a wonderful world we live in, still get to enjoy reading books just don't have to store them on the bookshelves.  As always Amazon apps is wonderful in making the d/l process easy fast and pain free.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect when I first heard of Django unchained.  I then saw the trailer and thought it looked pretty interesting.  I was pleasantly surprised with it.  Typically, my girlfriend tends to have ADD when movies are on but even she was attentive to this movie.  Great soundtrack to boot
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I am now fully aware that Tarantino has nothing left in his tank. This was slasher trash under the guise of showing American history through the lens of a man who goes over the top at every possible chance with big name actors wasted in a terrible movie. There was not one redeeming quality I seek even in difficult films I find redeeming in ways I can enjoy. I am stunned at the good reviews. This was nothing better than a direct to video slasher flick with actors you know instead of unknowns. Terrible performances by all concerned except Walz. DiCaprio is laughable with that phony southern accent to go with the pasted on 19th C. facial hair. Nothing memorable in this weak show of blood and guts instead of what a more disciplined, talented director would be capable of making. I was enormously disappointed seeing there was nothing worthwhile in this overly long, painful to watch, terribly acted and directed offensively intolerant story.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|cute movie.  not for young children, but not too violent for the tween set.  nothing more to add to this review
B004XUMMFE|5.0|With only half a season to its library, this show both created, and to date, ended a genre for television, and set a new standard for visual stimulation, character development, and still with a dialog driven story that i don't think the like of which will be seen again. watch this show!
B003NS2T9G|3.0|Blanket statements are rarely a good idea.  There are always many things to a review that should be considered.  However, I feel comfortable saying the British and Science Fiction movies are mutually exclusive.  I realize the aliens could land anywhere, but the sound of a British accent taking on aliens is somehow disconcerting.  Everyone knows any self respecting alien would only land in America.  I mean, after all, we have ( I wish we didn't ) California that contains over half of the &#34; unusual &#34; people in the world.  They probably wouldn't have to disguise themselves at all.  They could blend in and study us.
B009EE1GC4|4.0|Always love these actors and anything British. The age specific content is wonderful.  Some editing blips and other inconsistencies, hence only 4 stars
B000QCS8TW|5.0|With scope, scale and just good old fashioned story telling, this author is right up there with J R R, mixed with the drama and plot twists of a great soap opera
B00005J9PB|1.0|So the DVD I was sent is coded for region 4 and the U.S.A. just happens to be region 1, not 4... Therefore, I am completely unable to watch this movie...this is very disappointing...this is my favorite movie and I was really looking forward to watching it!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Maybe my mistake for buying this tween drivel, but it WAS advertised originally as an action packed futuristic novel. They lied. I've seen better commericals on nickelodeon than this entire book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have no desire to watch this series, but my wife loves it! Get it for your wife and you can pursue other endeavors while she is occupied.
B006LSZECO|1.0|worst book ever! just couldnt see what all the hype was about. The lead character was so sleazy, self absorbed and inhumane, if felt dirty just reading it. The plot was long, non sensical and downright infuriating, it's was an e book purchase, wish i could return it!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a very fun game.  It is an excellent time waster.  I completed requirements for free gems and have not received them.  My rating will change to 5 stars after this issue is resolved.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Once you build on the levels, you get so frustrated, that you just want to quit the game. I guarantee that when you get higher in the levels, you'll get stressed out and you won't play anymore...just saying. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game especially if you like to build, It's Legos on crank, I personally never heard of the game but out of the blue I decided to purchase it cause of the ratings, glad I did, now I want pc version, I especially like the multiplayer on pe, me and my 7 year old can play together and build elaborate worlds,  ever sense I played this game I have purchased other games that are like this one, block world and some other ones I can't remember, but none of them came. Close to this one,... I highly recommend this game especially for the talented who like to create from scratch And not mindlessly fling kamikaze animals from sling shots to knock over mutated green bodyless swines
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is an easy and good app, but it's not GOOD good. You could get better apps for free, such as Evernote. I use this for very very simple notes like reminders, but if you're looking for speeches, stories, or notebook notes, than I prefer you not to get this app. But, if you just need a reminder not app, this is perfect for you.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I loved the new album. I'm sort of a new fan, but listening to their old stuff, I do like them quite a lot now. I don't know what old fans would say about the difference, but the lyrics are awesome. And the sound is cool. My favorite track would have to be... Actually, I'm not sure. I loved Young Volcanoes, and Save Rock and Roll, Rat A Tat. I loved them all. :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome!! I love the characters and it makes me want to play it everyday!! Plus, they give you free coins in the daily challenge, which is just too good to be true!! The tiny bit that annoys me is that every time you go to the menu, an ad come up, and it's just so annoying, and you can't have the remove ads feature. Besides that, what a great and fun game!!!!
B0058VW36U|3.0|simple little game that is not so easy to do.  Bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter to play on my Kindle.
B0091QS88K|4.0|I like this app but it gets boring after a wile it is a very nice game for kids but the full version is way better!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is the best app ever!!!!!I totally recommend it if you love my little pony or if you just like building a town.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was awesome and I also love all the drama between Annabeth and Percy because I really like all the dramatic stuff, I'm just weird like that
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the honest writing. A surviver story of unbelievable strength and character. To survive a childhood with such tragic beginnings is an amazing accomplishment in it self, but to come out a winner and write about it in such honest<br />way .....wow ! A page turner.
0345522478|5.0|While the first book takes a little time to grow on you ... Hearne's writing style is solid, witty, tongue in cheek and just human enough that you can quickly relate to the 2000 year old protagonist.  His problems are human enough that, even though they are utterly urban fantasy, they still seem realistic and fun.<br />Look for Oberon in this series...he's my favorite character.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Our whole family enjoys these episodes. Occasionally its a little cheesy,  but we enjoy the drama and seeing how each situation resolves.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I am a big Joe B fan. saw him twice and met him once so far. when I hear PBS was showing this, i couldn't wait. It was a great performance. As soon as the cd and bluray were available, i purchased them. Actually, I purchased a bluray player just to watch this concert!!! All the other musicians are great. What a talent this young man is.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Suspense, romance and Matthew. Every thing you need in a movie. I've seen this movies a few times.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|I heard about this cd on Joe Bonamassa's web site. I was curious. Listened to one free song and I liked it. It reminds me of music from late 70's and early 80's. Different than Joe's typical blues rock. I listen to it a lot in the car, at the gym. cool songs.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Unrated is a must have to enjoy this very funny movie!  Not for kids, depsite it being a movie with puppets!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you grew up in the 80's and played video games from Pong thru all the variations and developments since then or had kids who did, this is a fun story of the genre and a possible future.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My husband and I love this movie!  Typically my husband will watch kids movies if I make him but this one he actually liked and wanted to watch again.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie and it was definitely better than I expected it to be. The ending could have been different or more stimulating.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Tarantino really out did his self in the one. Wow just at a loss for words. The story in depths and very detailed to the end.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It would be hard to not love all things Twain; what a clever and wise voice.  Revisiting this wonderful book as an adult awakens all the kid left in the spirit.  Jump in!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Lee Child has named this book correctly, everything Jack does is the hard way. I like Lee's writing because he really understands the U.S Army and how they do things. A saying in the Army is 'there is the right way and the Army way', but Jack always does it his way so there is a third way and that is the Reacher way.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and all of Lee Child's books about Jack Reacher.. Jack fights his way out of impossible situations in this book and through his cunning always come out on top. What more can you ask for in a hero?
B000002J1L|5.0|Nursery Cryme was the first album in what hardcore fans consider to be Genesis's golden age.  It might even be my favorite.  The recording quality isn't that great, but there's a wonderful rawness here that would quickly get smoothed out over the next few albums.  The album is book-ended by two masterpieces, \\"The Musical Box\\" (they never rocked this hard again) and \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\".  The other long track, \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", isn't quite at the same level but fun nonetheless.  Then there are the four shorter tunes.  \\"Harold the Barrel\\" is a classic, one of the band's best statements in less than 4 minutes, but I think \\"For Absent Friends\\" and \\"Harlequin\\" are worth a shout-out too.<br /><br />Highly recommended album!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I ALWAYS ENJOY MR.KING'S  BOOKS.  This is very good escape and excellent way to escape into a new world.  Thank you again MR. KING.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Always enjoy being able to  return to my favorite movies<br />and not having to pay full price or dig through my collection.....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was an amazingly good book and at the end it made me cry and I never really cry during books
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, especially since it was put together without a studio backing or resources.  The &#34;making of&#34; was very interesting.  My 12 year old daughter now owns it.  She can't get enough (big Neil Patrick Harris fan). Music was great.  Absolutely worth watching.  If you are a fan of any of the actors, well worth owning.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I really was into the game and focused.... but when I got to the end, was disappointed that it was over... hope they come out with a part two very soon.....
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The storyline was underdog saves the day.  I know the kids loved it. I really enjoyed seeing the games from back in the day.  Qbert was the best!  The movie was pretty unique which is saying a lot these days.  I would recommend this for rent or purchase, definately worth the money.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Excellent videos to view, quality and clarity of hd is good.  Selection is acceptable. Have this app on all my device's.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great film for all ages.  I watched with both daughters; ages 12 and 18.  The little yellow guys cracked us up every time we saw them.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It was amusing, but nothing spectacular...there were some really funny parts, but it was definitely no Bridesmaids.  Worth watching, but not buying!!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I'm sure my engineer son would understand it, however, I doubt even he would enjoy it.  I had it on my iPhone and deleted it.  This android version was downloaded by my husband for his Kindle Fire.  He deleted it a few minutes after trying to play it.
B001B68XRY|5.0|I know, I know, not great for kids, but my son and his buddies have watched this at least 30 times and laugh every time they do...it is a funny movie, ESP. For the teenage crowd.
B00AMPHKJM|5.0|For anyone working in film or video production who missed film school, this piece is a must.  Beautifully produced, it covers film history from the perspective of directors seeking to use the means to explore and express truth -- social, political, psychological and spiritual.  Clips from the great films of the past century are used as illustration.  Key directors, actors and actresses involved in those films are interviewed.  These, combined with the insights of the narrator, Mark Cousins, are extremely helpful to anyone engaged in film or video production--or anyone interested in film beyond the level of Hollywood gloss.  This is much more of a philosophical and intellectual history than a mere chronicle of technical evolution.<br /><br />Not a producer but a film lover?  This piece will point you in the direction of films you may have missed that will greatly enhance your experience with the medium. 15 hours -- find the time.  Highly recommended.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is a great app for kindle fire. It is scary and makes your heart pound. People who like scary apps will be satisfied.
B00BF123WG|4.0|A few facts left out or left hanging but overall tells the story of how dedicated some of our people are to protecting us.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The struggles of the British!  Granny makes the show with her disdain for change.  I enjoy watching in marathon blasts.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My granddaughter loves it, and can spent all day on it if I would let her... Would recommend for children!!!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This is another group I saw on late night TV.  Probably Letterman.  I'm glad I did.  I like every song on this CD.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a great game for my grandkids! They play it for hours on end, and are getting pretty good at it...
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This group really is FUN!  And unlike their song lyric, &#34;We are young,&#34; I'm definitely not!  But I really enjoy this CD.  It's great to listen to on my morning walks.  And althought I will probably be the oldest person in the audience, I can't wait to see them in concert in August!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app is very useful if search items from yard sale or auction locations, and great for tracking items being sold or bids.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I'm not sure what took me so long to get into The Flaming Lips.  I heard one of their songs recently on my local college public-supported radio station.  This is another very old CD.  Every song is worth listening to multiple times.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Sheryl Sandberg makes some good points and, as a woman, I cannot disagree with her.  Her delivery is surprisingly self-effacing, yet I cannot help but suspect that all she does -- including anointing herself as the leader of the &#34;Lean In&#34; movement -- is incredibly self serving.  Still, if she helps other women ask for and achieve more for themselves and their families more power to her.
B00B69UQJY|3.0|I saw them on Letterman and really liked the song they sang; but I'm not wild about the CD.  If you like Depeche Mode, you will probably like this CD.  I probably should have just downloaded the songs I liked and not bothered buying the whole CD.
B000X4GXT0|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out (late 60's?)  Michael York is amazing as well as the actor who played Mercutio.  The only probem I had was Juliet's crying, and I never see one tear, when she was lamenting.  But all in all beautifully presented by Franco Zeffirell( And, of course I own it on dvd)
B00BI745AA|5.0|The movie was terrific! No wonder it was nominated for the academy awards. For the most part the singing was top notch. At times, though, Hugh Jackman's voice was not spot on - he is an actor rather than a Broadway singer. We particularly lived the trios - in which the lovers and the outsider all sang a part!<br />Bravo to the songwriters and librettist!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Fimmel is amazing as Ragnar!  And his wife as a shield maiden is a strong female icon.  I love Flocke, he's such a weird little character, but his loyalty to Ragnar is unquestioned, and is a master at ship builder and healer!  Not sure about Ragner's brother.  He wants to be more than equal with Ragner.  Travis Fimmel is so physically fit and love the way he moves. I also think that having brought back a Christian priest is an indication of Ragnar's intelligence, as he know that information about the western lands is much better than gold. All the costumes are well done and, the theme song beginning the show &#34;If I had a heart&#34;  is magical.  The only complaint is that I wish one of the major channels would pick it up so as not to have commercials breaking it up, but so glad that it has been renewed for another season with 10 episodes.  I have preordered the first season as it will not be available until August 2014, so I have taped a few.  Don't know why someone decided to take out a few of the episodes &#34;ON Demand&#34;
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I'm not sure, was it the editing?  Was it the acting?  Was it the annoying personality and California Valley Girl accent of the lead female?  This movie is a complete bore.
0800141660|5.0|I love all the actors, esp. Hugh Grant and Allan Rickman.  Allan has played villains in so many movies, good to see him play a compassionate and caring man.  And Hugh Grant is such a fine actor! And I love all the bowing and curtsies, such a polite era!  And Emma Thompson, as always, is incomperable..
B009D8RJR2|5.0|Just finished this book, and I loved it.  And I loved it more and more as it progressed.  Saw a reader review that spoke to the lack of character development, but I found just the opposite: the relationships, both in work and love, are complicated, believable, and compelling.  Nothing simple here...<br /><br />And as for the kindle controversy, I purchased this book, in hardcover, for $5 from my local used bookseller.  No controversy for me.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Actors supurp, beautiful voices. Gripping and fantastic scenery. Would watch it over and over again. Makes me want to go to France to live it.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I love how the series goes along with the book. I can't wait for more. I hope the books get done before the series are.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved it, I almost can't wait fo the next season!!!  I hate it never ends.  Brilliant writing acting and scenery!
B000SW2F6M|5.0|I just purchased this movie for my dad because he misplaced his original.  It is a little to bloody for me but the men in my life seem to enjoy it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love the game. I find it relaxing to play. I don't like that I end up having to pay to play.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Great to have access to my kindle library which previously was only on my pc. Not pleased that a rating requires a twenty-word comment.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I am absolutely infatuated with Jane Austen 's writing! Every book of hers that I read I am sure it is my favorite and then I read another and enjoy it just as much! Emma I feel is one of the lighter reads. Very enjoyable!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Story was captivating and hurt my heart so many times. I appreciate the ending and easy everything fell into the places it did. Will be thinking of the children for some time.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Enjoyed watching. Found it interesting and engaging... Insights into what Viking lifestyle was and how they influenced the world around them
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|Not very much game until you have to pay.......seems like a rip off. I would have preferred a bit more.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Sherlock in present day New York.. well done . I Found it engaging and worth watching even with a female Dr Watson
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game works well on the Kindle Fire HD. Enjoyable game to pass the time.  However there are way to many pop-up ads, reminds me why I quit playing games on Facebook.
B00992CF6W|5.0|HI HI HI HONON P.E. IS AWESOME BUT HOW DO YOU UPDATE IT<br />HI HI HI H I H I H IXHXJXHXIX HI.  JEFF GORDON BROWN SUGAR LEVELS AND THE TWIST ON THIS PAGE BOOKMARK THIS POST LABELS AND THE REST ASSURED THAT YOU UPDATE YOUR BUSINESS IS AWESOME AND THE TWIST ON THE REST ASSURED ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS AWESOME BUT HOW CAN YOU UPDATE YOUR BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AWESOME BUSINESS
B001EN71DG|5.0|In an interview on one of the laserdiscs for the original trilogy, George Lucas remarked \\"a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing\\".<br /><br />Wow, he obviously forgot his own advice. Yes, after so many years, the original trilogy needed some cleaning up, but not a complete gutting. The fans who grew up watching them in the theater (and later on VHS) deserve to see the movies as they were originally shown. Having Greedo shoot first was one of the worst ideas in movies, EVER. It completely changes how Han Solo is portrayed, going from the cocky, arrogant, yet likeable scoundrel to an \\"oops, my bad\\" moment.<br /><br />The other changes are just as bad. Having Hayden's ghost at the end of RoTJ was unnecessary. All the pretty space explosions, unnessary also. As other people have clearly stated, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT! They will empty their wallets faster than George Lucas can count the money he has made off all his \\"special editions\\".
0812993845|3.0|Wedding Night is a cute and romantic romp.  While it was not my favorite Sophie Kinsella novel it is still worth a read and does provide a chuckle.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, we have the borrowed premise from \\"Legally Blond\\".  Lottie thinks her boyfriend is ready to propose and he only wants to ask her what he should do with his air miles. Lottie is understandably upset, as she always is, after one of her love affairs has gone array.  What she always does is go off the deep end and make Unfortunate Choices.  Lottie immediately receives a phone call from an old flame from her past, meets him for dinner and agrees to marry him.<br /><br />Her older sister Fliss is understandably upset, especially since she is going through a bitter divorce and does not want her younger sister to follow in her footsteps.  Fliss, who is an executive for a travel magazine, decides to pull strings to make sure that Lottie's marriage is never consummated during her romantic stay in the Greek isles.  This  way she can get an annulment.  What ensues is obviously totally implausible and at times downright ridiculous.<br /><br />Lottie is ditzy and neither of her boyfriends cut a real romantic figure.  Fliss also has a young son and  needs to juggle both career and motherhood.  While she fares as the better developed character, the love between the two sisters is apparent and helps to carry the storyline to its expected happy ending.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|While  some might consider this a geek book...it's really an amazing historical adventure of the future. Will any of this ever happen...who knows? What I do know is that the memories of my childhood....the things I grew up around....the games I played...and my friends as an adult...well, I think I found my own egg!<br /><br />Mr. Cline,<br /><br />I read this book because of an interview you did on Sirius XM<br />Book radio...I look forward to your next book...and if you do make a movie out of this be like Wade...Don't compromise, do it RIGHT!<br /><br />Thanks

B008QTVNUI|5.0|although not a similar plot line, the feeling of addiction you get watching this show is the same one I used to have watching the show Lost.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book shows people that what you look like doesn't matter, that who you are is what matters<br />(7 stars if they had it, because of the star wars references)
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This game is both fun and addicting.  Got as free app of the day but would be worth paying for!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved being sucked into this novel. I felt like reading this book was a great getaway from reality, which is a major theme of the story. The characters were completely relatable and I loved the references to the past and video games. I really do hope Ernest Cline continues to write more novels that I can get sucked in to.

B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford Season 1 was a worthwhile find.  The characters are so well developed and the pleasant, amusing, gentle climate of the village as well as the town is refreshing.  I will watch all the seasons and then begin again!

1400069742|3.0|It is an interesting history of America's entrance into WWII,but overlong,repetative,and filled with tiny unimportant details.Kind of a love/hate thing with this book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game had a lot of different scenes and puzzles. The story line was good, and the graphics look wonderful on the Kindle Fire HD.
1616647701|4.0|Not in my typical read list but it was selected for our book club. I read it and then so did my son. We both enjoyed it. It holds your interest. it was a little disconcerting to have just read it before the Boston bombing. What seems a bit of a stretch, took new meaning after that.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is great I get to chose how many pages.GET THIS APP ITS AWESOME! You'll love it because it awesome and you can pick you cover
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|It is exciting and the characters are strong. Picard is a great captain. My son is watching these for the first time triggered by his enthusiasm for the new movie release coming up. They are equally as good the second time around.
1580084621|5.0|David Thompson has a thorough and complete understanding of Thai flavors, Techniques and Cooking. This is a big book and with good reason. Thai Cuisine is sometimes bizarrely intricate and at others remarkably simple amalgamation of contrasting flavors. He really gets the Cuisine in a way most writers miss. This book is well researched and beautifully presented.I have spent many years traveling in Thailand. I find the regional cuisines are really well represented in his work.  Read this book and use it if you want to cook real Thai food. You will be given a broad insight into the techniques and a fundamental knowledge of Thai flavors.  Most importantly when you make the dishes they taste like Thailand! I have shared this book with Friends amateurs and Pro chefs alike and we all think it to be one of the best. I have many Thai cook books and this remains the best. I also recommend his book about Thai Street Food.
B002R88G5E|4.0|I enjoyed the writing and was fascinated by how resilient and strong Muslim woman are in spite of their hardship

0316187216|3.0|I LOVE Joe Abercrombie's books... usually.  The First Law series was good.  Best Served Cold and the Heroes were Awesome!  I awaited with eager anticipation, even Pre-Ordered \\"Red Country\\", which  I rarely do... when it arrived I tore into it.<br />Eh.<br />I was disappointed with the 'scale' of the book more than anything else.  All of his other novels involved massive armies, national level politics and huge, Epic-scale events.  Red Country, on the other hand, is set in a backwater, irrelevant section of who-gives-a-damn.  It is an Anti-Epic.  Even the surprise of a certain character, whom I won't name, was lackluster and much more poorly written than I have come to expect from Mr. Abercrombie.  The plot seemed to meander and although you end with the same sense of futility that seems to permeate all of his books, it seems... less important, this time.  I found myself, after the 'surprise' twists at the end, saying \\"so what, who cares?\\"  which is a real shame.<br /><br />Hopefully this mediocre showing was merely a symptom of Abercrombie's recent success, which means his work is in demand and he had less time to properly conceive and proof this novel.  Hopefully this is NOT the same problem as George RR Martin, who slipped from being an Amazing writer to a Terrible one in the span of one or two novels...<br />C'mon Joe!  I eagerly await the next (better) novel!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the appearance on my Kindle Fire.  Large enough to fill the screen..quick response..definite plus to have on my Kindle Fire!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I am not a minimalist but I needed some motivation to stop procrastinating and get sorting.  It has helped me be more thoughtful about whether I need to own items.
B00BGICG5W|5.0|So funny! You will love this movie even if you are not yet approaching 40. Just don't watch it with your kids around.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|If I could I would give this game 6 stars. I literally can't put it down. I also like that even if you don't finish a level in the time alotted it lets you finish. I get so frustrated with games that make you start completely over if you run out of time. It makes you think about how you could have done a level better. Love it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love strong female characters. Alecia Florick is very likeable, you can relate to her. Looking forward to Season 2.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Instructions would help besides saying that triangles are stronger. May be I'm just not the bridge building kind I couldn't get past the first couple of screens. I really wanted to like this. I just didn't
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I couldnt wait to read it to see what happened to all the characters and am looking forward to buying the next one in the series.  I hope there are lots more in the series.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very helpful once you understand all the great things this app can do! It takes some time but I've been able to dump everything in one place. Not a day goes by that I don't use it.
0425263908|5.0|Man, new &#34;BB&#34; alert! I read RIN and I was like, &#34;blah, he is hot but something makes me not like him?&#34; but I did fall in love with him in this one. I didn't know why, I didn't fully love him but I do now! Its his attitude, personality, charm, and everything else, not to mention those gorgeous looks!<br /><br />In this one we go through more trials and tribulations with the couple trying to balance each other out, while their jealousy ensues and grows to the extremes. The characters are also given more depth and Day reveals more characteristics to the main characters and side characters.<br /><br />The ending is explosive and I thought that I had it figured out but man, I had no idea. I was like 'wtf did I just read?' Then I went back over it to make sure and was like 'oh snap, yeah boi!' I won't give away any spoilers like I normally and unfortunately do every time I write out these reviews. But I will say that this is got to be one of the best books I've read thus far this year and considering its April, that says a lot.<br /><br />5 stars baby! 5 gigantic, humongous stars! Tips on the hips all the way!
B007CKNX28|3.0|This is MY opinion, so please be respectful of it.  =]<br /><br />I didn't really have any expectation for this album before I heard it.  But after hearing side one of the album I wasn't sure what to think, so I flipped the record over to hear side two.  Still didn't know what I'd just heard, and I couldn't recall a note.  I never give up on albums, especially ones by artists I really like.  So I continuously flipped the record over for hours, days, and weeks....  In no way is the music in the grooves bad, but it's just not very good.. nothing great stood out to me.  I didn't find myself wanting to hear a particular track like I do most albums... and I'll use the word nobody likes hearing, but I was bored.. the album was boring to me.  At times I felt like there was too much going on..too man instruments maybe?  I'm not sure..I felt like the backing band was in Jack's way a lot of the time which makes many of the songs sound like demo's to me.  The album feels unfinished and lacking of something...<br /><br />Having just gone through a breakup might have something to do with it, but if anything that should have helped Jack make this a masterpiece.  I feel there is one MAJOR flaw in this album that would have taken it to the next level.  And that's the lack of BLUES.  It didn't occur to me until much later after all those listens that this album needs a touch of the blues... I'm not even saying crunchy guitar riffs or less piano, because like I said the music isn't bad.. it just wasn't great and was lacking something.  And that's the Blues...
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Came in excellent condition and my daughter loves the series. Would def. recommend this to others. Check out the first and second series.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandburg is known best as the young, driven, Harvard alumna and successful Chief Operations Officer for Facebook.  From the outside, most people assume she is a woman who has it all and then immediately wonder what she gave up in order to get where she is.  Now she may add “best selling author” to her list of accomplishments with her first book, Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead.  Part memoir, part self-help guide to practical leadership, and part modern feminist non-fiction work, this book not only does she answer those questions, but in the process manages to offer practical advice intertwined with engaging stories on how to navigate the “jungle gym” (as opposed to “the ladder”) of career planning and advancement.  While her ideas can be applied to anyone seeking to expand their leadership, regardless of career setting, the well-researched statistics she presents throughout the book are especially compelling for women in the workforce and address a significant amount of attention to the topic of gender at work and in the home.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Watched this with my kids and loved to see the smiles and hear the giggles. It's and adventure that isn't to scary and moves along at a fast pace. Perfect for kids.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I was a little worried about how the TV series would portray the characters but i was surprised how good it is. It really takes you into their relationships.i love it!!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|i decided to read it after the book was profiled on good morning america.  thus, i was curious on how it works.
0451457994|3.0|When I watched 2001: A Space Odyssey (the movie), about ten years ago, I found it dull, boring, and deeply depressing. I also didn't understand what was going on. I decided a couple months ago to give the book a try. It's much better!<br /><br />The story is split into four parts (technically six, but I disagree with Clarke's seperation, and I only perceived four):<br /><br />In the first part of the book, there is what I thought of as somewhat of an extended prologue. We meet Moon Watcher, a member of a prehistoric tribe of Men as he uses his primitive brain to help himself, his family, and his tribe survive.<br /><br />The second part starts three million years after the first part ends off, and is about a mission to the Moon to investigate a strange phenomenon that has been discovered there.<br /><br />This second part ends abruptly, when the reader is vaulted into the scene of a space ship destined for Saturn. The second and third parts do tie together, but I won't give away how.<br /><br />Throughout these first three parts, I was torn between giving the book four stars, or five. The fourth part was what finally decided me on three. It's about the last 10% or so of the book, and it's definitely not the ending I had in mind! It's deeply psychological, philosophical, and just plain weird. I considered it a real anticlimax to a great story!<br /><br />Still, it's an epic, interesting, and engaging tale, and I certainly think that any fan of Science Fiction should read this book at least once!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I decided to see if I could access my Kindle books from my Android phone and downloaded the app in a jiffy. It works just like the Kindle for PC program and you have access to all of your Kindle content. Great product...
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Like any movie it doesn't really do the book justice.  Some serious plot builders left out.  If you haven't read the book this movie will be much better.
B004UPANGM|3.0|I wanted to see what this movie was all about prior to seeing the updated version. What a difference and amazing how far the movie world has come.
B004SRNH10|5.0|this app is required to run some games and it does that!  I had no choice other than downloading it.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I really liked watching this show that showed scenes that wernt in any other movie I have seen. This is a classic!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel. Fun storyline lots to do and the mini games are just right. This is a game to play
B0015LBYMQ|5.0|I already owned this CD so I knew I really liked the music but the sound quality on this vinyl version is great!
B00190OHD6|5.0|It starts slow and builds into a heart warming story, I've watched it about 6 times and will watch it again. Hiliary Swank's acting was refreshing.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Now I can take ebay with me anywhere I go! It's very easy and fun to use. Geat App! I'm addicted!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good read, but it's a very slow read with little to no action so it's easy to get bored reading this book, and to give up trying to finish it. I enjoyed the ending, but I did almost give up finishing this book a total of at least three times.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love checking the weather throughout the day. It's fun to check the weather in different cities. It's easy to use.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wow- I had seen the movie and thought it was amazing story and acting.  I picked the book for my kindle last week and started reading yesterday and finished this morning.  The characters were so well written.  You get a real insight into Pat Peoples mental illness as well as his perspective on the world.  I found it to be amazing and fascinating read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love using this calculator App! I use it while shopping to keep track of how much I'm spending. It's great!
B004LQGZ7G|2.0|If you are into dusting off your Gene Hackman history, this movie is for you.  (or nostalgia buffs)...However, it is very dated, predictable, and really did not stand the test of time.  Saw it originally and thought it was great...not so much any more.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I thought it was great!! At first I was concerned it was going to be an x-files knock off... but it is MUCH better done than x-files was. Looking forward to the other seasons!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good wife is absolutely riveting.  Usually you can figure out what will happen next, but not in this series!...It is a GREAT use of your hours.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I don't usually download games but I couldn't pass this one up. Can use it even if I only have a few minutes to spare.
1451648537|5.0|Author Walter Isaacson must have a strong sense of continuity. His excellent 2007 biography of Albert Einstein, who died in April 1955, was followed up by 2011's equally good biography of Steve Jobs, who was born in February 1955. It's an honest, unflattering portrait of the entrepreneur, with no sugar-coating of Jobs's prickly personality. Impatient and superior towards other people, he could often be a hostile boss at Apple, at one point being ousted. Worse, he could show a bullying attitude towards service employees in restaurants, the earmark of a mean streak. At board meetings in Cupertino Jobs would be ranting one minute, sobbing the next (weeping came easy to him), a sign of insecurity, to say the least, perhaps the legacy of an adopted child. His biological father was a Syrian student, and you can see the Syrian heritage in photographs, particularly in images of Jobs as a young man. (The book is illustrated by about 40 photos.) Jobs loved his adoptive father, flatly refused to ever meet his biological father, and on the whole, his relations with people could be difficult; luckily, he met a sensible woman who gave him a successful marriage. Raised in the middle class (unlike patrician coeval Bill Gates), millionaire Jobs held his 30th birthday at the St Francis Hotel, Ella Fitzgerald singing \\"Happy Birthday\\". Not bad for a boy who started his technological empire in a Palo Alto garage.<br />A couple of times when I was reading this book in a coffee shop, a member of what could be called the iGeneration would notice and gush \\"Oh, he was great! He was sooo cool!\\" Yes, he was very much a man of his time, which I'm sure contributed to his great success. There's no indication that he was a zealous reader; and, aside from a somewhat passive appreciation of J. S. Bach, he showed no interest in music written before the 1950s. (In fact he was friends with Bono and even dated Joan Baez.) Was he really smart? Isaacson says no, not that smart -- only a genius, like Thomas Alva Edison and Henry Ford. Sadly, unlike those two titans, Jobs did not live to old age: he died of cancer at age 56. But Isaacson, ever objective, handles the untimely death with clear-eyed sympathy. There's no Little Eva deathbed scene here. Instead Jobs has (as usual) the last word: \\"Click! And you're gone,\\" he is quoted as saying. \\"Maybe that's why I never liked to put off-on switches on Apple devices.\\"
B0041KBWM0|5.0|If you love Jane Austin this is a great series. The costumes and scenery were great.  I enjoy all of Jane Austin's work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|DVR the mini series and somehow the last couple episodes didn't get taped? I was in a panic so I turned to Amazon and Wala! My only complaint was the episode numbers were different so I ended up buying a few I had seen. It was good to watch again however!
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|This is a sobering reminder that we live in a world at war with itself as we dive into this family's story inside of a massive tragedy, a scene we have come to be all too familiar with in recent decades.  This movie reconnects us with the emotions that should be very natural as humans but seem to be numbing after seeing so many images of similar tragedies in the media on a weekly bases.  The ubiquitous images of tragedy are left in the background as a story of hope emerges from their midst.
B006K1IIHA|1.0|Its region blocked! So unless you live in UK or in that region dont buy! that is all I have to say.
B005F3XVA8|5.0|My family has watched this movie over & over again. It's safe to watch with the kids & makes us adults laugh too. We love it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Lots of places to go, things to find, hints if you need them, and a diagram to find you way. Well thought out and put together. I can always count on Big Fish Games.
B008Y6M3KW|5.0|My 14-yr old grand daughter says this is her FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!!!  She was thrilled to receive it as a gift.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I already had the Soundfly SD (The red one) and it is great.<br />I got too lazy to keep switching it between my car and truck.<br />So I bought this one for the truck.<br />The transmission is remarkable.<br />So much better than those inexpensive turtle shaped units.<br />I did not think I needed to see all the song info being displayed<br />but, after seeing it displayed it is kinda nice to have.<br />I put all my songs on a SD card and set the player to SHUFFLE.<br />I like being surprised about the next song that is about to play.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is perfect in every sens and is also my favorite. It helps you relax but at the same time it challenges you as the game goes along to try different ways to achieve your goal.<br />Also what I enjoyed, was the fact that you can do it your way(no pressure and so enjoyable) or try to solve the puzzle with the least moves as it was programmed to be. I would say that this is an awesome game  for adults but my kids (3,8,17) also enjoye it but up to different levels. Needless tosay it teaches them great thinking and problem solving skills....<br />But again, for adults, I couldnt suggest a better game to take a pause from everything or relaxe at night before bed.
B001MKVDPS|3.0|It was a bit predictable. It was a little disappointing from the standpoint of Anthony Hopkins acting. It was not believable.
B00A4W3AJC|5.0|What a great movie. Definitely worth the import price. i thoroughly enjoyed carax's use of the human body in this film. [see above]
B007GCY8FS|5.0|What can I say, Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters and Lee Child one of my favorite authors.  Always a good read
B00785P2QC|3.0|I would give 5 stars but you have to do too much hot gain points! I have this game on all of my devices and play them often.<br />Update - Lowered stars to 3.  In the game there is no way to earn enough investment bonds in a timely manner, so you wind up having to back them to buy space.
